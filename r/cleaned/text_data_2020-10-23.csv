Condoms ok, unfortunately magic bullet making be. Unfortunately one unreliable forms birth control, women significantly less control used compared men, used properly every time right heat moment.

Sadly don’t think even trump removed one else President issue mandatory face mask order states enforce it. Hell I’ll bet fight new president little letter behind name different theirs. pandemic killing us highlighting people systems companies don’t care people. Writing names corporations systems screaming proof others counter digging deeper. Like burrowing parasite. make parents go work kids go school, mounting cases majority population going anything else still fuck economy collapsed healthcare system. covid still risk.

Are serious? magically disappear people got bored acknowledging it. Fines thousands dollars seemed help Victoria given problems US Police, see used way targeted vulnerable rule breakers evenly. God damn Americans... hard? Yes, existence Republicans covid denialists negate many are. 

Nancy Pelosi telling people go Chinese New Year in, like, January make sides equally bad. this. I've seen quite bit local police saying enforce business shutdowns lawyers offer pay fines businesses comply. Midwest cases really starting pick up. think politics completely fucked country ones took seriously start.  It’s almost like blind sheep think critically. 

Now clue uncle suspect “it’s political” accurate representation beliefs.

But someone also successful Silicon Valley, politics def big component this. don’t believe that, don’t know tell you. this. sucks. audacity ridicule others trying stay safe, keep others safe. Disgustingly politicized sake money important health. That’s one things I’m worried about, it’s going long-term effects cognitive abilities. people already 50s 60s, etc going experience immediate disabilities. ""maybe""

Err. Yeah.

Don't leave people's intelligence goodwill You: “Name specific examples.”

Also you: “Those don’t count!” eat food mcdonalds cant eat food mask on, know tough concept virus live organism knows kills host, dies. mutated infectious kills less people.

The virus die regardless whether host dies immune system fights even dying slows more, killing 1 - 2 % hosts nearly high enough lethality rate slow disease. proven virus mutated become infectious less lethal, treatments better. ever say Predatory Capitalism isn’t toxic? I’m perplex derive statement “don’t need western capitalist assholes” “disagreeing predatory capitalism toxic effect”

So turns “most elite” still humans, govern perhaps greedier part human nature. Capitalism result, cause.

The past present always matter degree build upon have. starting new society system governance unless sort nuclear war wipe entire civilization. 

You liberal capitalist time. Name 1 European country doesn’t capitalist system.

Also, trust me, don’t want anything “community based local democracy” areas deep south. Don’t patronize me. know ever will. 50 percent April

.12 .06

that 50 percent were. know math hard fact. It’s joke mandate neither taken seriously enforced. Nebraska also one handful states statewide mask mandate. Omaha last city size create mask order, finally did, it’s one teeth. idea comment even talking $500 fines. Yet remove purely political post replying to. mods fucking fascists. long president covid denier, political subreddit whether like every post mine removed ""purely political"" talking politics relating covid. Stop removing anti trump posts hard Trump. say Tomato, say Tomahto. Fellow healthcare worker state next door Bayern. also keep public life stripped right back due job. moved Germany right covid chance make friends helps! But, I'm glad choice. know regret choices end pandemic. Yes people unemployed can't find work virus bunch whiners. mean needs food, lights, shelter, right? clarified. covid still risk. CDC come official death/survival rate virus ? ride it? haven’t yet!  would change lot mandated wearing *properly* wearing nose doesn’t help anyone It’s pretty much standard thousand separator outside British Empire

You speaking language British Empire. English, full stop reserved indicate decimal point. Exactly. Dr Michael Osterholm said talk 2019 Covid, ""We could never go war China would lose immediately. make daily life saving drugs.""

We would never, example buy weapons ammunition overseas get cheaper. thought absurd. men charge think war chasing oil lot often think health well being. People care long ""freedom""  Seriously. I’m mom BS makes angry. One reasons deleted Facebook ten years ago... I’m good. quit eating Applebee’s. keep forgetting one key factor. Information safety cautious disregard information. infection rate half even high 7 months thing regardless many tests doing. Thats whole point here. People still putting situations contradicting virus. argument ""we tests today cases high"" valid July August 1 week fucking November. point tests infection rate somewhere 10-25 percent back April. Lucerne U-S-A! U-S-A! dumbest fucking country what? seem like timeline vaccine wide, lot people saying Vaccine available November, news outlets saying wont available Q2 2021? disappear election! That's rate 140 per 100,000 last 24 hours. Schools still open, businesses still open, mandatory home working. curfew 11pm 6am. Fair enough. argument came people use ""low death rate"" excuse need wear mask public. What? first amendment? people. idiot? idea overnight stockers doing. What’s point. simple math done. 

if infection rate April (.12) would 166,000 new cases 83,000

I sorry American School system failed you, math classes TIL would rather say something stupid like instead engaging actual conversation. Good one mate. Sure, positivity rates important, tell whole story either. rates reflect increases spread reflect increases mandatory testing. Lots happen here. better proxy, IMHO, hospitalization death rates. Though lagging indicators, clearest least noisy indication there's problem brewing. still sure JP success low testing numbers guess miss lot cases possibly deaths.

Japan seems OK right following cluster busting strategy realizing ""k"" seems important R early on.

[“This Overlooked Variable Key Republicans trying stop adding liability forgiveness public, private companies non profits stimulus package. several reasons Nancy saying deal, that’s one Additionally, attempting set distribution USA republic. people sub bunch bellyaching babies virus. grit whatsoever. They’re chipping away freedoms. want see get away with. people get use listening government “needing”’there assistant control push legislation onto people. country fought freedom, yet people starting easily give freedom. 98-99% survival rate depending age group. We’ve living flu long time flu kills people? weren’t wearing mask that? likely die car crash Covid. I’m saying Covid hoax either. I’m saying it’s another virus people get sick of. die many live like people catch flu. purchased 5 foot PVC pipe distributing Halloween candy. Heard online, sounds fun way lol want money get sick gotta pay ventilator oxygen hospital stays pokes pricks government care enough anyone care money wearing masks giving exactly want money sick like past 200 years SICK PATIENT KEEPS PAYING healthy patient reason pay Wear mask. COVID take care people won't. 

It takes week # daily COVID cases double record 85,000 cases surpassed soon, mostly likely next Wednesday. get 40% ? assuming Republicans wear masks? Lol ""positive side"" Civil War 2.0 would make everyone forget COVID deaths.... absolutely insane, safe assume cold like symptoms 25% chance covid.

Where live 2.9% thought alarming getting close 3% Every idiot ran stat month ago. 

That 6% figure deaths listed Covid cause. rest listed cause death whatever ***Covid caused***: Covid causes sepsis, strokes, coronary thrombosis, organ failure, etc., listed cause death. redditors don’t care people’s rights? What's telling time period author gives, three weeks first confirmation infection realizing gonna bad. Look data notice lag increase cases increase deaths, 2-3 weeks. There's way could known bad Covid-19 would well first confirmed case. author using hindsight accuse Chinese government cover-up.

I see hypocritical articles. Please stop. order would injunctioned day three. effective strategy. There's hope. fine people wearing stupid nose. Everyone wearing Thats even remotely true. people wearing masks. see every day.

You correct, matters region. I’m San Francisco area, 100% mask compliance here, occasional nose sticking maybe. However, relatives Idaho say masks rarely seen area Idaho.

To point stopping virus, areas like mine 100% mask compliance, seems really clear masks wiping virus fast people non-compliant areas seem think will. Masks probably help bend curves small amount, show time based curve favorite metric mask mandate “bent curve” visibly 10%? Pentax already making sure drug weather sealed  camera accurate radar/laser detector irrefutable. fundamental rights Americans always fucking lie anyway, reserved White wealthy. cherrypicked carefully, chose timeframe suits tortured data says wants? Fantastic, call science! Even though pandemic started late february/early march, vast majority cause deaths September likely registered (I would really surprise place like Sweden takes month compile deaths), chose totally arbitrary data points... because?

""I would like counter argument saying population increased yourger age groups due immigration"" 


Immigration alter age profile Sweden country massively. fact sort people heard making argument literal neofascists. seem real beef migration. 


""I also want point deaths automatically going per capita increased average life span."" 


That works. Aged countries fact often larger death ratio. Check demographics Japan death rate less double middle aged countries Brazil Mexico. 


Undersigned: someone actually qualification demography.  We're going cross threshold. food shortages. Meat plants close. Towns look like ghost towns weeks. people learn? always hope know. learned 225k dead yet. weakest pandemic I’ve ever heard of. Congratulations giving rights little lung pao don’t parliament call republic? Or... hear out: People caught ignoring mandate automatically ineligible healthcare get covid19... oh wait happens disallow unions, weaken quality worker. It’s pretty much standard thousand separator outside British Empire I’ll upvote attempt humor. “we best pandemics, records yuuuuge” Babies breath air bodily autonomy. can't abort baby baby born baby, dumbass. Learn science Hell no, imply that? virus much deadlier got health problems. 6% dead health problems, would mean US, example, death toll would probably smaller yearly flu one them. need people look themselves, rest us need protect vulnerable kinds.

Not let die lmao. Christ. never even mentioned wanting go bars over-estimate half time. survived, like 99.5% (as per CDC) caught virus. Including 99.9% younger people 60. flu kills young people, children infants. 

Yall need F right hell panic. USA doesn’t Parliament. 

Wearing mask place business USA isn’t actually law, it’s like bare feet shirt. policy set. 

Is meant? don’t want misunderstand. pleasantly surprised see Texas highway patrolman wearing mask issuing someone ticket. Stop talking please Except take oath help everyone, even hateful shitfuck politicians. legitimately idk do.

Wear mask face shield go doctor's. Maintain isolation. Let McDonalds burn. necessarily. means big variation activities people dined didn't. certainly say either group attending large gatherings statistically significant amount. Perhaps groups avoiding activities equally one dining regularly. nice walk around ignorant

HAHAHA Worth pointing 4 employees wore masks get covid. not, try probably vaccine Easter 2021, least hope. user name checks 🙄 15k daily infections Belgium

15k daily infections Czech Republic

45k daily infections France

20k daily infections Italy

23k daily infections UK

and on. numbers despite mandatory facemasks. still quickly rising. I’m sorry works perfectly scientific good way describe vaccine. Literally vaccine works perfectly. Even MMR 97% effective that’s highest I’ve heard of. heartbreaking see cry :( imagine shoes &amp; amount frustration must feeling. obviously cares lot people &amp; takes job seriously.  This, Boston early outbreak took sink in. important understand data making analysis. I've assured people ""the virus go away election."" 

Fucking idiots dude.  “There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling the mask and keep touching face.” 


- Doctor Fauci

It matter reason quote, matters responsible thousands wearing masks. sister’s university isn’t. sent announcement week saying classes going online winter break. want avoid people traveling bringing virus back campus.  rest government gets tested daily somehow immune test swabs? contain secret anti Biden voodoo? ND fastest growing Earth?

Think Maddow said last night Pretty sure strain one came via europe. particular NYC presumably prevalent one today US (and europe). Yeah sorry intuition agree math. walk math I'm assuming really care. probably man power enforce mandate. surprised many people idiots. wear mask 12 hours day 5 days week job plumber. pain ass whatever. best part mask might save others public lip word fuck whoever can't see it. worst part smelling rancid cigarette breath. Easy fix. Federal mask enforcement audit. Federal employee tested negative presents mask-less law enforcement. law enforcement person enforce mandate face consequences. I'm sure kind consequences available fully support fines imprisonment. person upset 5 years 5 different stores existence friends can't find work, understand why.

Must nice walk around ignorant. Lmao kind hardcore question good one. you’re 12 get sniffles homeroom teacher dies, you’re gonna feel responsible. yeah levels way higher record US numbers america one terribly apparently. complacency does. Well cases people infected twice. agree science isn’t complete data points already show repeat infection possible. actually alot worse. 23.6%. youre citing misrepresentation spread part disinformation campaign meant downplay threat. See real data read site linked carefully, means 6% Covid death certificates. others effects disease like respiratory failure pneumonia. humbly ask please update post stop spread misinformation. find asshole bat? get punch stupid face. customer came today, without mask, pick catering order bakery work at. politely asked mask would like us provide one. “I’ll cancel entire fucking order ask again.” Cue managers bending backwards make happy stands highest traffic area store mask on. didn’t want lose $100 max protecting us. Another guy grumpily put mask asked several times, loudly told everyone building “I wearing mask election!!” 

I’m fucking done.

Edit: southern AZ anyone wondering. Yeah. found something obscures license plate extortionate. It’s science politicized. Fucking dumb.... truly feels like goal conservatives point frustrate liberals severely decide leave country, even costs lives lives families friends process. Stay tuned til next week change minds... lying teeth make 120k year according math. elaborate this? searched study skimming text, can't find (and I'm time right find interesting pass).

Thanks advance! one takes seriously.

3) Yes

What chances? Fuck, restaurant opened back two weeks ago. LOL, like comeback, state reminding whole Spongebob meme. next day, next day, next day.... already then! I'm sick assholes putting rest us risk! i'm remote fall know survive another semester like this. school finally seems uptick cases seems like shut thanksgiving basically done deal spring. well decide whether ""honest"" worth mom's life.

I think moral flexibility okay. Na I'm ""dead"" serious expect want stay home longer  mean didn’t happen similar thought process happened 1970s. millennials (the late best birth cohort ever) born force within 10 years preventing population permanently dropping. caused abrupt worldwide uptick began one month schools opened?

schools may main driver, imply significant spread population largely untested due minimal symptoms dangerous rhetoric i’m pro life could phrased better.

not people don’t support abortion cases hate birth control. applies anything else, like mean like B distracting point weak reasoning. go millions free testing locations? State state. We’re rounding shit ask view Sweden situation? American it’s incredibly hard parse. 

Meaning ... outbreak there, attitude public towards death rate, things getting worse winter? Etc.

A lot articles see come .se URLs difficult judge validity. (Not sure I’m looking news site someone’s blog. I’m little familiar Norway sources.) It'll probably end around Easter. likely memorial day. virus we’re talking do, lot people think goes away April, heat, heat comes in, typically go away April. contact tracing rapid testing. wore masks. listened scientists stopped problem.

Is contrast difficult understand? Thanks. seem right. Pushing back when?

Until worldwide pandemic control. virus. timetable. goal species minimize spread vaccine developed, tested, manufactured, distributed. That's metrics need happen done lockdown.

Minimal infection rates. deaths. far densely populated countries succeeded road succeeding. tyranny

Tyranny implies harshness, oppression, unjustness. There's way anyone truly believes precautionary measures viral pandemic kill *millions* species unjust oppressive. means troll, engaging waste time. Another daily record? Sweet Jesus Sorry I’m convinced country-wide surge cases correlation school reopening. Kids may get sick sure spreading it. one-day record increase 1,800 newly confirmed coronavirus cases reported Saturday Oklahoma state health department.*  Oklahoma State Department Health report comes one day Gov. Kevin Stitt extended state emergency due pandemic.  Friday extended 30 days emergency order first*** ***March 15 extended several times.***

My state sunken place. Stitt state emergency, mask mandates? Infuriating! federal government control social distancing lock mandates, pointless. story man firm believer god:

One day Spring, new disease emerged world. started dozen cases, soon became hundreds, thousands, millions. spread every corner earth, killing many.

Despite knowing disease contagious, man continued going church. kept attending large gatherings others, unprotected. all, one knew virus, God would protect him.

The virus continued summer, man's second cousin virus died it. Every day thousands people died horrible deaths pandemic. famous doctor many decades, Dr. Fauci, got news said: “Please wear mask protect others. one simple act could save thousands.""

“No thanks”, said man. “I’m firm believer God. keep virus away me”. refused wear mask. even told family friends wear one. Prayer enough keep safe. 

The pandemic continued winter, soon man's coworkers best friend even brother caught virus. ones die gravely ill weeks, sometimes even months, recovered same. 

The CDC told people, ""Please avoid large gatherings. Wear mask wash hands. go unless to.""

“No”, said man. “I’m firm believer God. protect me. Don’t worry me”. man kept going church every day hundreds people, even crowd seemed diminish size every week. even went friend's big Halloween party. 

Then one day, man woke cough fever. entire body ached hurt ever felt life. short breath going stairs home. searched symptoms phone, saw World Health Organization said, ""If symptoms, get tested.""

""That's alright,"" thought, ""God keep safe. like flu, it'll go away days.""

But get better. Every day woke up, body hurt more, fever got worse. could barely lift finger, keep food. sweat much sleep, thought he'd wet bed. time, wife children gone, either sick dead disease too.

Still, prayed, knowing God would help him. test faith. Surely believed, everything would alright end.

A week later, asphyxiated phlegm, organs shut dehydration. soiled bed. last breath, kept praying God save him.

When man died, went heaven. There, interview God. 

After giving polite greeting sitting down, man asked: “Where you? waited waited. sure would rescue me, firm believer life, done good others. needed you? keep safe? let Coronavirus kill miserable, painful lonely way? trusted you, God.”

God scratched confused looking face answered: “I don’t get either. sent Dr. Fauci, CDC, WHO. sent mask-wearing social-distancing modern medicine. accept help?"" It’s wearing masks that’s needed. People literally rip faces second exit building, care world touched hands unclean, rip masks like it’s going style.

Understanding respecting masks whole problem yet deal with... Probably inconsistent messaging. personally wear mask go out, it’s hard make argument friends mask WHO, CDC, media, everyone else place regards masking months. 

Additionally, media spent months saying lockdown protesters wanted kill grandma could get haircut suddenly everyone okay giant BLM protests middle pandemic. ANOTHER one They’re like “for DOW 401k getting haircuts, sacrifice grandma.” know dude, expect person it? add problem? I'm Mormon stay home mom. agree wholeheartedly you. matter what, important take pandemic seriously get people/kids tested. even woman wants abortion. like they're telling pregnant women skip going church. Casual Sinophobia normalized insane WHOLE SUB ONE RECORD ANOTHER 

for fucks sake 

We’re gonna shut down. real  Pcr tests don’t gold standard base rna on. it’s irrelevant data. obvious conflict interest people make money testing get money tests positive. 

Real people real problems treated. don’t take cars away too. would eliminate auto accidents. 

Also aren’t advocating alcohol banned? Reddit tell think today?

Downvote conforming Reddit hivemind Ah got it, troll no, 10 cases, [-1000 screw everyone trying close schools! cares? old wreck going retire weeks anyway Ok I’ll try make example. village 10 people. disease comes. 3 people get hospitalized tested disease, one dies. rest village refuses testing. remaining 7 people, 2 mild symptoms actually caught virus.

Is death rate 33.333% 1 3 confirmed cases died 20% 5 people actually disease? That’s basically arguing about.

And yes understand ratios. ratio 1 complete death.  average tax 4k hahaha make 60k tax like 50% income. Yes, partially right outcome covid binary. dead alive fine week. hundreds thousands people usa breathing problems moths sick. People hearth issues, brain damage other. So, idz sie jebac, okay? Yeah, went dentist summer person wearing mask. dentist put work usual, nobody office wearing one. way saw big trump 2020 van unloading bunch stuff office made sense. become medical professional able ignore pandemic beyond me. stupidity, even among educated people. go gym I'm person wearing mask, even cases skyrocketing here. selfish stupidity. Agreed. I'm NY, hotspot Covid back March/April. actually told wear masks beginning (insane) masks ""for sick""

Masks finally mandated sometime back May (iirc), numbers dropped dramatically. There's still cases massive spikes numbers stayed pretty consistent. 

The numbers speak themselves. Masks social distancing work. idiots crying masks ""impending freedom"" absolute morons Yeah, I'm sure go Worf:TNG them. Appalling think might that's I'm medicine. source link wrong something? match title. Lol article question study estimates costs due sturgis extrapolated much. say sturgis super spreading event debunked. like u say look things tho shit pure irony 😂😂😂 Ask someone thinks earth flat, faked moon landing. They’ll make something Surprised Mormon church hasn’t made special masks sell members. due size country better classify waves region. *Epidemiologists hate them! moms' easy trick ""beating"" Covid keeping country open* Im right pal. following since mid January felt worrying nothing while. I’m sad it’s gotten bad thought could. Exactly, that’s I’m saying it. virus dangerous winter, better idea lock winter?  Kobe's dead? 'many vaginal steaming services'? 

Wtf?  The*Daily Show* good “rounding corner” montage week. one talking NYE look like. Hopefully. Preston hasn’t messed us. Also saw number hot spot listings Kew morning’s DHHS press release. even winter yet... 🙁 remember Florida 3. it’s gonna go away /s long tight lockdowns don’t work capitalist society, people owning business (not business corporations, aren’t) end broke employees unemployed can’t work. I’m saying shouldn’t restrictions, think masks mandated extremely promoted, state encourage social distancing businesses, locking postpone inevitable. ideas might got it?

Also please inform everyone came contact last week. heard Michael Osterholm say first. think “normal” entirely personal.

No kidding. There's normal ""return"" because....I never left it. Staying home nothing life before. We’re going go sine wave out. Winning bigly live Korea too.  family countries implored come home saying things like ""Do really want turns pandemic?""

I think made right decision What's percentage? Numbers matter. 1% disaster. .001 not. Saying something happen isnt important numbers somewhat high vitamin taken prolonged time tested for.your levels? America impressive got 2nd wave top already ongoing first wave Let’s promote conspiracy theory bullshit please.

He did, you’re running feelings one.  Eventually climate change. correlation != causation. 

The vast majority elderly vitamin deficient, mechanism understood relates covid-19 winter yet. Oof  Oh good, hold rallies churches please! followers still undecided. feel way. fiancé’s families upset we’ve already said holiday activities. haven’t seen since March bc won’t stop going out. daughter high risk don’t care 2025 thought France us beat, comes Trump Super spreader events spraying load everyone claiming immunity. ""We rounding turn."" ""But turning corner."" Crap. That’s like half state’s population! hope symptoms short course it. You’ll thoughts. serious? spike directly coincides states like Florida Georgia opening up.

The cities protest mandates didn’t experience spike

You can’t claim make decisions based data completely ignore data Illinois, public health doctor literally broke crying today press conference numbers getting bad. could hear frustration voice, grief lost lives, concern health care workers. knows went April knows going go again. begins speaking 10:00. 

Heartbreaking hear exasperation trusted leaders, probably endure regular death thing Europe keep hearing record numbers hear lock downs mask mandates actions taking. 

I hear record numbers america nothing. Europe bad right now. reason believe improve soon. America bad right now. imagine bad get. southern hemisphere, summer coming.  300? That's rookie number. even got news also mocked *different* reporter *not* wearing mask yesterday. Tremendous drugs. best. Highs like wouldn’t believe folks. Feel better soon. 51 year old I’m fighting hard catch damn thing. There's *lot* people regards virus... are. Cut slack. She’s obviously burned out! need close nope. America happy sacrifice families business! Oh god, jarring horrifying change minute 2:30. legit recoiled stark contrast 

Well done Packed churches Easter I'm thinking take bit longer that, I'm guessing hit two weeks sure. Anyone thinks we're making 2100 pretty optimistic.

Most damage done past fifty years, already far gone alot ways. nuke other, another disease complete destruction economy it. avoid grocery shopping? Yes, I'm taking zinc well. Socialism gets tests. work public health it’s really expected public reacts basically every public health issue. don’t cry work. Rare hear voice like reddit. main theme/narrative always advocating hard lockdown. little bit plus could go long eradicate virus Professor Richard Wolff suggests thing. US unable respond crises. feels weird watching shows now. I’ve isolated pretty much since March Jesus fucking christ, absolutely fucked. Good luck two. That's great movie. zombie movie feel it, despite zombies. fall cliff technically rounding vertical corner. Well, thank goodness. want end pandemic much next person, would rather safe effective vaccine doesn’t potentiate antibody-dependent enhancement anything crazy like that. Theyre tripling rates so... Contact tracing amost impossible locality population mostly ID easily scannable.

In tiny island live Asia, almost everyone ID, choice contact tracing either app scanning ID, manually taking notes ID. recently implementing pre-registered bluetooth token system elderly.

Any public venues, mall, shops, offices, whatnots mandated keep record. venues encouraged create QR code specific venue, would need scanned visitors upon entering premise.

The QR code would lead website must 'check in' upon entering 'check out' upon leaving.

At 6 million population, place almost zero community case since past weeks.

With computerized record, whenever report infection, alert would sent mobile phone telling whether past 14 days, places visited visited Covid infected person (s). I’m sorry. Fingers crossed guys. Hang there. Trump right...I’m tired winning... like millions supposed die even accounting social distancing masks beginning mess. MuH 6 GoRilLioN11!!11!!! Like say I’m Louisiana, protect police govern want, end day, can’t stop hurricane. Temporary measures, matter successful, don’t stop Mother Nature coming back. Crazy eyes ""nothing""

Oh dear. said time being, still think time lockdown save lives, relaxed summer cases. Definitely long-term solution pretty clumsily implemented well, guess back started pretty much except lot stupid conspiracy theory now. thought reached 15 people went away? Toss bodies streets anyone thinks it’s hoax. No. winning you. shall make champion you. we're testing more. yesterday 1. know situation still havnt gotten stimulus check earned zero income 2018. actually could use money. it? job life focused around crowds, like concerts, restaurants, schools, theaters, theme parks.

This kind stuffs happening, world pain regardless path take now. mean, pandemic after-all.  Ah sucks. I’ve always able gain weight relatively easy, losing weight really hard think drinking main culprit.

False. Well, play show coronavirus cases first appeared days tool concert. already identified super spreader event now, without MJK bit. 

That said, one giving shit NZ. Even bring (unlikely) fault. took great precautions here, saw doctor wore mask, public pressure musicians think pretty harsh judge it. virus problem, people Thank posting this. Nah, freedumbs therapist lose minds anti maskers. know helps anxiety, nice complain someone understands. hope despite hopes skyrocket winter. Plus Indian govts Indian Govts schools. idea actually came Germany, handled pandemic pretty well. basic common sense really though. I've seen brainwashed ""educated"" liberals asked simple questions asked back stupid comments like ""Trumps racist"". never can. usually get violent racist feel trapped. America always right thing exhausting alternatives. Well still bad compared czech, comes number cases number residents... Common trend around world right now. US that's breaking records. US states ...special. think federal HIPAA laws don’t apply them. forget nowhere federal state jurisdiction FDA approved smoking cessation products considered tobacco products. Hopefully isn’t case live. Nah man, heat kill virus. Oh wait MaSkS wOrK! Hope Biden impose mask mandate 2-3 month lockdown. badly need both.

Strongman cred (if) recover. need month without long weekend dumbass hands lets loot protest.. typical strawman argument. Italy many countries almost killed economy imposed first lockdown earlier year. People knees struggling recover financially also mentally I’m sure. plain cruel disrespectful. 

Governor De Luca almost 8 months prepare called second wave, ICUs won’t overwhelmed. Instead he’s threatening regions blaming citizens struggling is. Given financial support priority him. even said loud saving lives priority, matter consequences. disagree him. It’s never priority world prior covid can’t either cause society know collapse. I’ve saying since beginning...

“It affects someone effects see want see.” Americans suffer. dismiss success countries call numbers fake instead od looking sone slow spread. 

Its bot going away us nothing. Negotiations went months. Crazy thought would affect every country. usually 3 grown kids significant others, 2 grandkids, maybe couple tag-a-longs. elderly dad. I've help survive covid. I'll happily give everyone to-go plates. I'll miss playing games fun, can't risk it. Lining massive explosion deaths Election Day.. predicted back March. bean counters don’t seem understand medical costs lost GDP mass infections last seventy years incalculable.

It would cheaper completely shut economy three years let millions become infected. could explain Spain European country summer spike. seen numbers Europe? second wave already 3-4x worse summer. city lockdown hospitals nearing capacity. ""people like me""? I'm American, believe countries (like Italy I'm from) we've hade discussions, solved issues, months ago. fault USA even admitted counting deaths people COVID COVID deaths. 

Regardless deaths infections, quick determine whether people exactly dying COVID not. die stroke day fully discharged hospital weeks forced ventilation, always sure COVID? COVID basically stop breathing opinion, even COVID increase mortality significantly people wide array previous illnesses? Carefully accounting examining medical records every dead person takes time resources, take medical professionals doctors needed assist people need planning avoid medical catastrophe instead sitting desk carefully deciding whether Mrs. Doe died *with* COVID *because of* COVID. Mistakes may happen everything do.

How fake positive tests, comical people hard time believing things like Trump's doctors say something people Trump admin say something accept number thrown state federal government, even China.

So lying opinion? Trump? governors? CDC? state administrations? state commissions? laboratories? hospitals? making numbers? honestly don’t know could done fix point. something put place, half Americans wouldn’t follow it, like didn’t before. Thanks info. Please encourage active COVID infection go drug store. friend drop medication instead. many deaths actually have? Besides homeowner spitting mouth trick treater instead giving candy, visitor returning favour, don’t know could design event better spread C-19 Halloween. People *terrified*. We're going flu season Covid gonna get worse deaths skyrocket. Anyone taking serious huge asshole one forget value entertainment/freedom lives others. Meanwhile, us care holidays, actually quiet relief family gatherings year, even though reason cancellation pretty horrible. remember watching like six times week in... wanna say late March, fuck knows. Foldable Human video exact reaction, close experience eerie. struggle understand exactly this. Coming doctor? sure dreaming, even dreams irrational. almost higher demonic power sway people. people removed reality even coming face face everyday? Can't wrap head around this. Haha, think second USA lot 83k 24 hours. 

Just look stats CDC lost control Corona reporting. know could be.
From see tv many people masks definitely protest people believe virus exists.
Also protesters walking towards regional government exactly day said wants impose soon hard lockdown 30-40 days totally own: agreements mayors, government technical committee.

I justifying protests. governor right principle. way handling thing since beginning: going political party, central government, governors, citizens themselves. thing, Europe going peaking second wave. forgetting USA couple months behind. Remember Trump closed borders Europe (but UK!) March 12 epidemic there, USA? due leadership ineptness general negligence, first wave hit USA much harder Europe; second wave too.

That's accumulated deaths per capita higher USA European countries already, even though epidemic started later USA. example, 700 deaths per million USA, 120 per million Germany.

So feel free, make comparisons.  WE’RE NUMBER 1! WE’RE NUMBER ONE! Booooom yo face! GLOBE!!! Biden come back might died laughing Good News! first COVID treatment drug approved FDA Trump Adminstration!

Just Goole together remdesivir along work. It’s cursed pixie dust 🙄 Don‘t worry, tho. won’t US. I’m 100% sure lot people countries also ignore „don’t meet family Christmas“. Germany also „Weihnachtsmärkte“ (markets around time Christmas, usually going entirety month december, selling food, mulled wine etc. generally packed people) authorities saying open around Christmas.
So yeah..... YES Eat snorts! military gunned protesters en mass would save innocent lives overall cost. People

We'll wait see shows among arrested tonight, I'd bet good money list usual suspects: ultras, political extremists assorted thuggery. sincerely doubt actual average people Naples. Restrictions vary region region. city (around 200 cases daily) outdoor stuff open. Shopping also allowed, wear masks social distance. situation dire nonetheless. Hopefully entered plateau phase ones all. Ah aware political situation / healthcare &amp; employment clusterfuck regarding gums US. Thanks explaining it! now
   
:') 1. Positive test



2. Get treated best doctors country best hospital




3. Get well




4. Brag it




5. Downplay virus 



So far worked Trump, Brazilian president work guy too. currently step 1 five years seeing eye watering class action lawsuits lot employers didn’t protect staff. Ever watch Dallas Cowboys home game? stadium huge isn’t it? holds 80,000 people. Imagine completely full stadium. That’s still many people tested positive COVID 19 today (and reported) would say so? can't understand virus gone away? hope accomplish meeting except make church members sick? hard fathom initial reaction one anger, 9 months pandemic I’m starting realize species going turn around destruction we’re bringing upon ourselves. There’s many idiots. America, Belgium, whatever.. I’m losing hope reading things like this. so? Mask wearing, social distancing frequent hand washing do. Looking COV19 numbers see eat safely folly. simple. go anywhere *have to*. Stay home unless must work. Wear mask. go crowds. Social distance. That's hard. it. Everyday. TSUNAMI-19  see IG stories people partying shit, like damn, haven’t able since March! need streamline civil system people recover costs infected negligence another.

For example court could easily piece together timelines messages example, hold son’s mother financially liable medical costs lost earnings result complications.

If people know would mean losing house car, possibly never owning either rest life wages garnished one two million dollars, bet would take seriously.

A lot people care themselves, impose civil criminal penalties make behaviours effect them, simply won’t right thing. Taxes (Edit) teachers know this. underpaid childhood development instructors forced read script say. love teaching I’ll never can’t speak truth goes another ones agenda beliefs. Every virus mutate end fucking discussion. Oh yeah. European, behalf brainlets, apologize making fun America. But, over, we'll happily continue pretending better never knew those, seems really helpful. thanks heads Covid deniers anything avoid getting virus control. one already done part community politely asking everyone place shit communal box. Everyone's needs calm get shitting together good us all. teachers get paid then? Statistical whoopsie Let's recap:

You: give money people need stay home!

Me: Italian government money that

You: ECB controls money supply, wrong think can't help

Me: ECB can't print money give people

You: never said that! that's strawman!

So exactly trying argue brought ECB discussion finance ""giving people money""? spent time discussion claiming say actually explaining point.

inb4 explain point next reply either Keep taking mask, president proudly does. Iam surprise rate cases returing current kind leadership country.

Our leadership taking serious, heck probably serious right. Analytical thought hard people. They’re regurgitating things read “hear” never verify themselves. work boy anything pay mortgage car payments again!! Gotta provide family much room using brain! know I’ve there.....14 months job family; fun We’ve gone masks city Greece I’m grateful Government finally making people wear outside. people refuse follow scientific evidence benefit us all. mandating simple cloth covering way go protect us all. event kill humans worldwide event witnessed species far.

- black plague killed 25 mil lasted centuries, corona-virus worse.

- Genghis Khan killed 40 mil, corona-virus worse.

Mark words, idiots said would blow couple months one's going dismiss words again. afraid mean reality stop occurring. 

The way avoid deaths magnitude total global unity cooperation, know pipe dream considering many stupid selfish people know stand way that. called autumn ... course it’s gonna rise. thing missing number dead Trump clips, adding soundbites later pandemic, also number dead. It'll couple weeks, end May latest Well done every day recovery mate! Huge effort hopefully nets huge rewards you. Hey! That's me! You’re diminishing dead number doesn’t shock you? hell wrong you? members someone’s family, people crying won’t get see ever again. Every life lost covid sadly preventable seemingly unstoppable time. students die car accidents every year. allowed drive well, sit car well. could possibly foreseen this?? FOXNEWS simply ignoring help either. visited website mention covid-19 first 5 pages. They're watched TV news network USA. I'm glad people fighting right privacy, think either or. I'm sure done ensuring privacy. types places shut down? specifically policy consumer behavior? I'm actually interested I'm really seeing that, anecdotal I've voluntarily limiting activities do. know bars frequent target that's specific business that, reasons, easy get compliance safe practices.  remember sitting aunt sister outdoor cafe January telling going big deal world, par world war.

They laughed told calm down, wasn’t Black Death.

That last time went eat public together year. in: according study funded airlines travel groups, flying said airlines travel groups found safe. Yes...but that's probably property damage caused... ...and provide exact level protection, exact duration, natural immunity provides....against particular strain vaccine based upon add.

The strains may protected against.

C'est la vie sur la monde. Funny. place quirks :) someone could voice millions Americans. only.... Oh yeah, like places too, theres towns crazy it. lot communities can't even park car driveway MUST put garage, I've even seen trucks big fit way pulled far garage door bumper/trailer hitch. spend big ticket items situation recovers.

I'm actually worried prices apartments go sharply next year since many people saved lot money Covid year want use upgrade move away city Telework continues Lmao likewise. sub insane. Half people probably addicted benzos comment makes sense. Whether believe I’ll one not, don’t hate people success. hate abuse others success. ample evidence individual so. guess USA really number 1 astounded hearing Trump say, ""If I'd listened scientists, we'd recession right now."" he'd listened scientists? anyone vote president ignores science peril country beyond comprehension. course one wants recession. However, countries around world lockdowns mitigate spread. Recession better millions fatalities. coordinating national strategy? Maybe establishing national production center PPE sends weekly masks every household? Giving money expanded testing? stopping unemployment benefits early? Kinda easy life before. Double slightly 2 4. massive 25000 50000 Wow, really dick right, matter what. Cool, cool. EU EEA, mind you. entire continent, including Russia. Total pop. ~750 million Except letting everyone whatever even worse economy people's livelihoods. Many economists agree state iowa shows, anything order ""save economy"" makes economy worse. become clear society claims best education planet, yet constantly questions science behind masks pandemic, mandating anything futile act population cannot comprehend 'why' let alone willfully comply laws laid out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fauci better becoming refugee fleeing Canada. hop across border. valuable skills (to us anyway, like science) would permitted remain country.  You’re missing point. Tech billionaires, made money last 10 years, nothing changes you’re complaining about, one conversation ever came remotely close saying pay taxes do, less.

You’re fighting straw man. One car accident ""take number.""

Or life-and-death it'll be, ""We're going medevac another hospital, hopefully live make way, here's $200,000 bill air ambulance. That's top bills, course."" CHICAGO, Ill.

13 local businesses ordered close defying Gov. Pritzker’s orders 
Currently, IDPH reporting total 364,033 cases, including 9,418 deaths, 102 counties Illinois. age cases ranges younger one older 100 years. preliminary seven-day statewide positivity cases percent total test October 16 – October 22 5.6%. Within past 24 hours, laboratories reported 82,256 specimens total 7,113,338. last night, 2,498 people Illinois reported hospital COVID-19. those, 511 patients ICU 197 patients COVID-19 ventilators.

Yet people shrugging virus USA. “I’ll home Christmas...” understand now, interesting short time span. Poland car needs sit really long single spot look like broken, missing license plates - towed away municipal parking occupy street space anymore. usually happens 6 13 months car sitting single spot rotting :) Okay..? Death rates among age groups. can’t attribute summer death decrease ONE metric. That’s I’m saying. Gtfo think see definite answer year even message ""we keep everything open part mask up"" start would change wishy washy answers we've got along way open close open. wet market connection? Nice! We're catching Europe! breaking records weeks!

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, least redditors got want. spent months saying like Europe comes coronavirus. Well are! Yeah tried post thing Facebook this. “Them dems messing numbers” 42% first deaths nursing homes/assisted living facilities. Assuming many taking precautions, cuts number deaths huge margin. Article lack mask-wearing public problem, think people getting private in-home parties get-togethers. Public health officials need stop using phrase “masks social distancing” like they’re one same.

The government issue fines people don’t wear masks. can’t issue fines people friends dinner drinks. latter what’s driving surge. leaving bowl end driveway... trick treat without “spitting other’s mouthes”  Yeah lmao dare kids go school homecoming games. You’re kidding right? Like polio, there's inactive virus vaccine give US now, there's live virus vaccine give places. live virus vaccine cheaper, rare cases live virus mutate instead mild version polio gives immunity becomes bad version polio paralyzes someone. Still useful have, though, that's rare cheap. single person 70 died covid. Agree. Even mask enforcement, keep hearing people constantly gathering small groups driving numbers. birthday party here, baby shower there. Dinners, play dates, business usual. Public mask mandates won’t change that. TBH I'm sure Korean style contact tracing would accepted EU, know serious privacy there.

Our contact tracing agency unlimited access credit card, phone location, CCTV data.

Even discussion whether breach privacy, know Europeans might reacted. Labcorp’s tests $120 without insurance Fear inoculum fragile elderly already dead? agree sane approach, surprised say rare. fact based? Sweden patients moved around sure. *but course, time, late* Ok, correct myself: jumped species well Sars 1 2.  become new normal. We’ve adapted life. Probably usual denialists. Note: turn volume, video link starts autoplaying. websites still that? Well, give honest answer question Americans tolerating this. reaction situation sounds somewhat reasonable basic premise true. everyone get virus 1% people get virus die. However, actuality IFR believed significantly (~50% least) lower everyone get (~50% prevalence appears expert consensus). 3 million dead Americans became 750k dead Americans. importantly, virus doesn’t kill indiscriminately. Virtually casualties 65+, average age 75-80. 750k dead, we’re talking maybe 50k 65.

The problem facing you’re looking kind reaction old people die. Old people always died. pick local newspaper pre-COVID there’s Obituaries section chock full dead 80-90 year olds. Announcing deaths 80 year olds simply doesn’t generate shock, fear, anger, emotions needed rally people take strong efforts combat disease. We’re talking 50k “real deaths” spread year, it’s enough motivate people get response want. Lol...I get saying wish God easy wearing mask. worst part whole situation personally know 9 ppl gotten covid. freaking 9 religious mask wearing hand sanitizing every surface touch ppl .meanwhile loud mouth dumb asses work laugh cautious ppl 1 gotten . keep telling matter time get covid . 6 months I've telling .it make sense ..I wear mask every day I'm def anti mask also realize mask anything stop virus. better take look Sweden's death rate compared neighbors Forget half million lives! 10 million lives could end! Even billion!!! quintillion! Good know- yes need update phone  right, mean anyone 60 pretty much already dead. what's extra couple hundred thousand dead they're old? 

/s People assholes Predatory Capitalism. Look history. Also looking USSR / China safe say don’t need western capitalist assholes. think built Predatory Capitalism begin with? Aliens? 
Also please explain Democrats considered extremely conservative highly doubt 1000 cases 28 states single day March. That’s simply enough generations /chances jump many state boundaries. highly populous states? Sure. half states though. I’m sure that’s partially reason why, suggest that’s reason, main reason, narrow.

Masks decreasing initial viral load infected better treatment/knowledge disease also huge factors. Agree, today recorded equivalent 491,000 US cases, that's nightmare--17,568 today record Yeah, it'd interesting way magically see numbers really were, comparison's sake. know also result fast burn? Extremely quick spread 15-30 group virtually hospital cases building immunity fast, weaker population shelters short period time want refused care. young groups biggest spread vectors anyways hospital loads come people actually partake pretty much herd immunity. think 1.36M people die end, nobody forcing die. 

What would rather have, 100% people lockdown 2 months getting immunity 15-30 age brackets much less risk vulnerable population that? That's thing me. love Vermont. live Massachusetts, go Vermont lot stay cabin. Since pandemic started, taken bringing groceries supplies risk spreading anything Vermonters case. go all, hole cabin weekend. extremely careful come low risk county Western Mass. 



And stupid family wants trample disrespect Vermonters. came, they'd going everyday, without doubt. really pisses off. There's thought others. Vermont fared really well going responsible outbreak.


It pisses us work stop spread others ruining everything reckless. store requires it, I’ll wear properly. Since it’s store. that, yeah fk wearing. Mainly I’ll fine don’t care u Juuuuuust rounding corner drumpfy says.... say going go like zero well back March... Nah, what’s point? sensible people already wearing ones aren’t don’t care others, ‘rights.’ Mandating masks won’t enough sort idiots out. country brought sport NASCAR? Agree, SK especially contact tracing effective Here's latest case/death charts curves still moving steeply. 

Overall they're still well behind death rates states. Wisconsin currently 29.71 deaths per 100k, ranking 42nd per capita excellent news watched whole family walk grocery store last night mask, definitely would imagine so, things horrible winter. However, many states comply. Montana huge state tiny population. People spread out, death rate still high, it’s bad. also hospitals Montana many people live far away. perfect time Trump's latest Supreme Court justice help kill Obamacare leave us covid-related preexisting conditions medical insurance. ""This never happened!"" 

Gah, word triggers now. “We’re rounding corner”.

Yeah ... worse street, exit ramp. They've already said vaccines last maximum 6 months take one 
 
That's never said
 can't take vaccine once
  
That's never said either Australia, movement restricted states various hard boarders, New Zealand completely isolated Scotsman Fallacy--No country Europe succeeded acting soon enough virus, Far East countries well, Japan, South Korea etc Yes overwhelmed quickly good choice continue resources it. possible achieve low volumes infection. done extent think it. made small level people know etc. Sweden effective measure since virus everywhere. [6% deaths people without health issues that’s roughly 15000 healthy ass peoples dead far Europe Reminds story COVID-denier ended hospitalized seriously bad shape, quickly needed vent. lived came conscious explained COVID sick still like, ""But that's hoax, exist!"" 

The nurse like, ""Well, okay, believe want ICU COVID ward still danger dying COVID."" Another day, another new record. 2 week quarantines longer recommended Butt-Head: *Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh…*

Beavis: *Heh, heh, heh* mask mandate really helped Texas finally imposed one summer (at least seemed - new cases crawled fraction been). However... stores enforcing anymore everybody wears masks improperly, us much good now.

New cases city 10x low point summer, positivity rate 10-15%. Montanan here. Things vary greatly (as I'm sure places well) depending County in, proactive people are. County absolutely terrible prevention care even still think hoax. venture see even elderly walking around like everything's normal without mask. fact see actually using masks period entering store. town population slightly 2000. neighboring County lot still lot resistance well. 
 
 get FB solely check family members checking local news affiliates pages see comments section last month so. mostly see: ""it's low death rate."", ""It's flu"" disheartening personally, ""everyone dies."" Sadly individuals mostly ones helping spread something believe in. pointless even argue even want consider peer-reviewed studies listen local health officials, fact we've quite health officials resign due threats disagreements local governments officials, least area.

 common attitude we're small population concerned much. Blackfoot tribe takes virus seriously regular Montana folk. shut reservation think twice since beginning blame all, fact wish rest Montana would concerned. 

Stay safe everyone. TON areas us, car spot unmoved even relatively small amounts times ""abandoned"" car considered ""non operational"" towns youre allowed abandoned/non operational vehicles roads. Thus ticket. Compared rest south, Louisiana great. also Democrat governor mayor New Orleans. Coincidence? Stay home scared people wearing mask. Here's latest case/death charts Iowa, running 7-day spikes. They're 51.25 total deaths per 100k population. ranks Iowa 24th terms per capita terms per capita 7-day deaths, currently ranked Yes. lot misinformation seen people embellish nature Covid scare us action.

This scare mongering accompanying lockdowns destroying entire generation. End lockdowns now!! ministry silly walks checks in. Fucking Pimmelnasen man, everywhere That's fascist would say US likely much, much higher numbers then, pretty much nobody got tested knows? watch Election. Thanksgiving. Christmas. New Years. Wow. Good luck. That's awful truth right indeed Jeezus, trust FDA more?

First test kit debacle, approving drug even (apparently) work intended purpose.  really sure it’s good business long term given impacts areas hospital like elective procedures. comes wartime triage like Italy starting making decisions would receive care based likeliness survival, important drug. People turned away Italy (I think received palliative care), certain age preexisting conditions didn’t get treatment enough resources. another surge hospitals filled capacity, freeing beds 5 days sooner may mean people get treatment needed survive. meaningful. Sounds like plot Lifetime movie. “What could *possibly* do? Actually try keep people safe stop spread like every developed nation world?! Hah! total fantasy.” bunch doctors nurses go meeting plead board keep mask mandate...and:

Another (board) member, Allen Banks, denied COVID-19 exists.

“Something's making people sick, I'm pretty sure coronavirus, question asking is, 'What's making sick?'” told medical professionals testified. Bro, even look data, say things get upvoted sub fear mongers? Good info. Thanks correction. studies calculate cases immune antibodies (anymore)? 

That might add another million. Something like 1-2% total pop known cases. absolutely fucked.  *Covid approves protest.* Unfortunately. Threes many info keep sorry posted questions relation US.


The increase death mostly age group?

Are sick recovering home? Usually without medication?

Those end going hospital treated particular medicine help recover able walk alive? doctors/hospitals aware working treatment time?


These questions come mind, I'm curious know hospital treatments, longer March think (hope) hospitals better understand eat treat patients.

Thanks  get texts Carlson fans they're awful.  covid expert, skim lot news listen medical experts.  Answer question: healthcare much better, likely die france catch covid US? know talking about? :) Remember big spike 14,000 China? Remember bulldozing roads leading Wuhan like 500 cases? Remember video people Wuhan crying screaming? live Croatia type festival, city they've announced it'll open stands spread across city concentrated 1 square like before. rate cases really think unfortunately hope closed completely guard 42 effects real, barely remember anything happened December last year now. Remembering stuff 2019 makes feel like retired person looking back thirties almost like random controlled studies showing masks work. yeah remember. felt like way much back  Weeeeeeee champions, friend. we’ll keep non defying masks ennnnnnd. hand waved away facile arguments

Yes, dare point actual reality proposing? that's ""facile"", unlike deep hard-hitting proposals like ""just get ECB loan bro"".

Let problem typical internet commenter thinks world simple mind understands it, thus can't even question whether ""million"" possibilities comes make sense. necessary questions simply occur you, faced reaction act indignant someone would put head. next reply, guaranteed.

You're facebook boomer shouting ""why government fix this"", decades younger one advancing argument absolutely third option.

Where say that?

The third option differentiated, targeted restrictions leave economy going (and economy keep going, simply can't afford let it) giving us breathing space contain handle spread. Distance learning secondary higher education, test-and-trace focused workplaces instead generalized, lifting restrictions public space use restaurants operate open air without shutting down, remote working mandates...

The reason none done governing coalition precariously hinging deal parties strong technical background inclination, state machinery would need wield enact measures like incredibly slow inefficient, even try. OK. tell many ppl died result missing treatment allowed see doctor/ visit hospital due tlock doen precaustions. many extra suicides, mental problems, deaths due poverty stress brought lock down? Harrison Ford narrator psa. Unfortunately count high quality post got rejected here. really annoying know people advanced stages cancer looked skipped March hopefully terminal could prevented.

You know , whole pandemic could avoided people paid bit attention what's going used common sense. decided buy car (first ever!) masks hand sanitizer started stockpiling food January info coming China (well, Taiwan point). do. would plan would stopped thing tracks country 300+million? many freedoms would take away would enforce it? Jail time violators? Serious questions. USA! USA! Stay strong!! 40s. people helped cars kid old. much world, want lot get old. exciting start new projects. Let us know hit 1mil infected milestone.. watched movie first time summer. Really gives way much credit us government. NASCAR baby!!! [The NHS (UK) using though I'm unclear experimental/routine is. limited evidence decision based (as June) discussed included studies review suggest benefit remdesivir compared placebo reducing supportive measures including mechanical ventilation time recovery patients mild moderate, severe COVID-19 disease supplemental oxygen treatment. However, statistically significant differences found mortality serious adverse events (fewer reported remdesivir compared placebo). cost effective. Less fiscal measures surviving population . sure ask advice, I'm looking reusable masks they're practical moment disposable ones. Would something like effective disposable masks protecting others? Imagine 15% like here. Although basically beg people get test. I've tested twice many friends family tested least once.

Good luck there!! Also Ohio. Hour west Columbus rural area. would say mask wearing 90 95%. stores, school functions. schools homecoming outside football field. Loads pictures kids masks. rural county less 400 cases total since March. county us, even major urban city,is purple 2500 total cases. husband works manager grocery store. bosses son covid. Pretty sure too.its scary. Right doorstep. Maybe become doctor and/or hospital manager seem know better people charge.

Maybe open clinic backyard show us really done. lot less deaths april/may, one factor probably people tested. It’s scary seems smug ass eurotrash talking much shit America months? stupidest country world. always cry I'm angry frustrated. shortened recovery time 5 days work title misleading. dismiss this, actually holds truth it.

When infected people cough breath out, infected particles eventually settle ground get kicked later date cause people get sick again.

It happens Influenza Cold viruses, need right moist warm environnent (ie: nasal lung areas) re-activate multiply create havoc.

We get dreaded ""Ekka Bug"" coming back every year dust kicked Showgrounds effectively ""hibernating"" settled dust previous year. many times source going wrong? LOL. worry, government said everything 'under control' lol. North South Dakota said fuck feel lady. must hard. corona.... you. :( btw many cases sabah? depoh imigresen jails it? asking since isolated community government take notes sg. Thank you, Powerful_Advantage_9, voting AutoModerator.

This bot wants find best worst bots Reddit. [You view results reply comment, I'm still listening votes. Check webpage see vote registered!) Life pretty much normal part world. wouldn’t even know covid thing wasn’t overseas news. People don’t even bring virus anymore. Rookie numbers. 
Regards US Good bot Let's see happens next virus starts making headlines. I'll bet world collectively saying ""enough enough"", country start enforcing borders like 200,000 lives depend it. Presumably exactly science. make logical conclusions based data statistics. never know anything certain. 

Low O2 levels symptom. Vitals require intubation symptoms disease. improved 5 days sooner means reduced symptoms. metrics. 

How someone “feels” scientific metric determining improvement. It’s subjective, also sorts challenges measuring type data. controlled trial like uses clear concrete outcome metrics. may problems them. study said 5-10% people drug reported feeling better sooner (rating feel random scale like 1-10) even vitals metrics same, would convinced drugs use even effect O2 physical vitals?  You’re right, thinking India nah high 70s completely safe

which none pharma companies wants liability product. counting fall like second wave, winter third wave minute* Last week February think world 80,000 total cases (or maybe new cases?)

Either way. Exponential growth hell drug Malaysia broken four-digit ceiling 1,228 news cases new cases, 502 prison clusters. surprised all. Every state opened early. 

I live New Jersey work wedding industry. People weddings pandemic. goes Pennsylvania well. 
 
Seen weddings 125 people, masks, dancing, buffets, charcuterie tables...

There accountability all. sucks working industry right now. brides grooms think wedding important family vendors lives. 

And say someone postponed wedding... twice year. religious all. prayers me. do, keep posting telling people wear masks. Hopefully, message reaches changes mind someone area.

Good luck. Well, decreting lockdown lockdown, either isolating vulnerable population isolating everybody.

Anybody quarantine whenever wants, i'm favor type financial aid support people lockdown. impose everybody. Portugal Easter government prohibited everyone travel counties unless paper saying need work sent police check counties borders. caught outside county would get fined. 5-6 days little warning avoid people travaling earlier

Now Halloween weekend due 1 November (All saints day) big day here, every one goes parents towns visit graves.

The government said yet know happen christmas new year, although probably 10-12 days. - gets old seeing everyone site say ""I would sue"", ""I would call police"", ""i would kick ass"" sit home lockdown judging situations people based one sentence. amplified subreddit everyone huge reactor dont see reason doubt researcher would overlook simple thing, first indicate possible children schools lower spread rest (overall) society. 

If think studies done /that/ poor, dont read few? That's actually true, though believed myself. forget actually control over. may hospitalization data, case data. one day increase records getting rather common Switzerland went back mandatory mask use public restrictions national level. Yesterday record number cases since started, breaking record set day before. first wave, lockdown brought us 10-20 cases day whole country summer, absolutely clear resurgence. Hopefully new restrictions get things back control, fear heading needing another lockdown, much better controls terms public health measures that. Sabah need lockdown. There's many cases there. Right 12c (53f) windy raining am, keeping windows open obvious choice potent therapy would well. pkp 2.0?

at point victoria-style lockdown 1 km time. especially sabah maybe west coast. I’m Victoria, two waves starting ease restrictions toughest lockdowns world. rest Australia one wave though, back normal months (apart New South Wales Queensland who’ve scares). That's literally is. morons bother use seatbelts, car seats kids wear shoes public? mean “mUH RiGhTs”... ask nicely give fuck someone besides work... Lower income people can't afford get sick. Literally figuratively. studies suggested many people’s immunity virus could last years, even without presence antibodies.

Care share studies? Peer reviewed I'm assuming? already throwing around ideas. Meeting ski hill feels like winning idea. new authoritarian entered arena! I've dined indoors restaurants three times since pandemic began. time apprehensive since virus invisible anyone could've infected. last time dined indoors 7 days ago. So, need wait another week find decision dine indoors time big mistake not. I've tested twice Covid-19 - negative times (I tested biopsy surgery).

Half time employees wear either. National mandate fix anything everyone's already using ""muh freedoms"" excuse currently forever pandemic. Ignorance hard fix there's much anti intellectualism going around. Masks really helpful. work pretty well wear others wear them. trust everyone around wear mask correctly, we've already seen politicians planes without masks nose like dumdum.

The in-flight exposure exposure travel plane. There's car ride there, security, checking bags, waiting terminal, people getting food coffee kiosks eating restaurants masks, course.

It's choice plane one part experience. One highest world counting Nordics? Make mind. mention rare complication children infection. Actually no. went conditional law.
But president issue executive order let states fight it. take years goes supreme court decide hear it.
Meanwhile order effective Basically rural sheriffs departments extremely right wing reactionary, gonna absolutely case every state. Internet dipshit looking raw data =/= expert opinion Ethiopia refusing wear mask see jailed two years.   AMA? OK.

How feel party's inexorable March towards fascism? party's policy white supremacy grift align religious values? manage cognitive dissonance shifting party small government one super spending, nationalism, science denial?  vote Joe Biden Donald Trump? say that? didn’t see that. Facts facts. think point people strive healthy definitely improve messaging. I've seen reporters news wear masks. politicians political figures press releases. Start making feel normal going top people wear mask (even necessary people 6 feet apart). Go businesses, people. Good taking positive action! article actually explains this. epidemics. fizzle burns winter. Dying D&amp;D. Wow.  took away speeding limits would people driving reckless? Probably. Sure doesn’t stop people breaking law improves compliance. certainly city really Everyone already hates DeBlasio. welcome club. 

As Pelosi, I’m sure telling people racist towards innocent Chinese people downplaying Coronavirus, okay man. Whatever. SF. Nope. Parliament makes mandatory laws, businesses. CA here, SD specific. I’m quite often job rarely see people walk sort store restaurant without mask. virus live organism knows kills host, dies. mutated infectious kills less people. Plus, frontline worker adept dealing virus.....more ppe etc.  infection rate go half would argue point. 

If rate April, would 166,000 cases 83,000

math matters. seems little bit critical thinking matters also every little bit helps, 10% difference effectiveness social distancing, mask wearing, staying home sick, hand hygiene, etc. make huge difference one way other. Nevertheless, scientists confident say something prescriptive wearing masks. It’s solution, says Gandhi, “but think profoundly important pillar pandemic control”. Digard puts it: “Masks work, infallible. And, therefore, keep fine/making mandatory. people straight refusing/ridiculing using masks. normalizing step -1 Yep. going bad. bad. join vaccine team think one (that safe effective)this year!! new flu. vaginal steam spa vag itself?

TIL sub 30k makes understand vaccines. misinformation happen here, citizen journalism happens places want happen  Sadly. wouldn’t trust US vaccine all. boomer neighbors decided get circle talk every Saturday. Apparently mask social distancing. Cuz quanrantee boring.

I feel like long ppl like never recover  great, no, unless government passes another stimulus guarantees payment services inevitable insurance companies would start treating like disease. Hello, maybe missed conversation initial reactions 9 months ago. you’re bringing since then, maybe missed ads Jerome highly encouraging people wear mask social distance, Mitch McConnell highly encouraging people wear mask, well various republican governors senators. really thought u something huh That’s constitutional representative republic supposed work. perfect many ways preferable North Korea. live Canada difference cultures painfully apparent COVID... Canada underlying culture me, stark contrast individualism found US.

Complete licking wrappers ice cream sandwiches dessert  certainly could demonstrably past drinking age.

But would take much time noticeable effect. expect 10k hopsitalisations covid 9 november (+/- 4 days 95% interval.) mean political reason would mask mandate city, state employer one? 6% assumes Covid doesn’t kill CAUSING... pneumonia, ARDS, clotting otherwise healthy people. Newsflash, does. Masks effective. mask mandate, however, would ineffective, significantly raise percentage people wearing masks point. line thinking longer applies 7 months pandemic. expected cases would rise higher number tests longer ""more testing"" people idiots. late October struggling still people make smart conscious decisions pandemic began February country. 

The issue tests, people still listen. That’s true nobody anything states municipalities would eventually enact restrictive measures. general public eventually catch point also change behaviors. don’t think actually means. Currently, waiving 100% pocket cost.  Oct 31, Covid patients presumably bear share cost treatment would pay got disease.

This something people accept, hospitalization could bankrupt average family even insurance pays 80% bill. testing saves lives, shoots free. refusing cover Covid treatment, all. cops reactionaries, likely Trump bootlickers. math. Nope. see one clever enough take look silly Southern Hemisphere nations.

Any nation remotely could called winter, many part world, steam rolled.

Now countries get -20 -50 it, opposed countries winter mild.

Vitamin deficiency makes respiratory illnesses worse, dry air allows increased transmissibility mucus membranes dry basically stop working soon see lockdown Austria, actions spread ridiculous health minister saying people get infected home schools work. Yeah... Andrzej Duda great.

As far total recovery rate, inverse death rate... harder calculate rolling basis since death/recovery outcome lags initial diagnosis varying amount time. dashboard try track number Europe flattens curve, that's enough.

But ""my freedom"" worth stopping covid. Mandate mask virus 98-99% survival rate? cause government says should? Stop sheep. control. wouldn’t limit french fries one company. Ice cream, frozen fruit, veggies, pizza, burgers... Variety speed up.

The daily. Stormer.

That's realized sub longer unfortunate misnomer pure xenophobia No. evidence something like 

I downvoted saying completely untrue. virus mutated.  
  
  
The impact mutations significant absolutely mutated. 
 already seen phenomenon occur much discussed D614G mutation SARS-CoV-2, arose February 2020. mutation viral spike protein (the spike protein part virus used invade human cells) enabled virus transmit effectively person person, affect disease severity.  Well, you’re country full idiots, currently led narcissistic moron. Easier said done. Many switched Linux support Windows 7 ended earlier year. go home mom, that's 👍  Lcokdowns sustainable, curfews definitely are. we'd call curfew norm generation two ago shops closed 6pm bars much later. emergency city council meeting following this. thing flaccid noodles could come rapid testing sites popular known hangout locations. citations issued, arrests, consequences. truly fucked nothing convince otherwise.  expect? Half us got bored wearing masks decided cancel pandemic.

""Stupid stupid does."" 100k cases reached real soon Let say this, loads normal people sensitive death anymore, Trump win next month. dont einstein tell look covid case count anti maskers actually prove country's population believes science dont.

If believe COVID rates measure extent population “believes science”, measure of:

a) government’s response 

b) government’s response 

c) government’s response 

d) government’s response 

e) seasonal/environmental factors (impacting population behaviors)

f) government’s response 

g government’s response

h) million things control *in pandemic*

i) government’s response 

you genuinely worth wasting time on. goes way beyond acceptable levels ignorance. 

Like...do think COVID rates shooting Europe past weeks populations Germany/France/Spain/Italy/a bunch countries suddenly stopped believing science...but believed science summer rates lower? hilarious way someone’s brain work. everyone keeping windows open already? WTF? last time many cases flu per one day? close... already is. want spread hyperlocal good news: elderly neighbor (early 80s F lupus, parkinsons, RA) got released hospital week COVID support... remains clear pnuemonia! ... caffeine pills flip side? good solution, guess. 

I sincerely hope able get back find rhythm again, can. Gee, could go wrong? Chinese. Knew news soon blew China.

It's... wild. thought CDC would able scare Trump GOP least rapid response.

Nope, guess idiot leaderships always death empires. Courts MI WI blood hands. Push Pfizer's vaccine market already save everyone. think either things lucky unlucky. SARS-like viruses biggest novel disease fear Asia since first time SARS made jump humans. Largely SARS viruses always come Asia. surprising would choose practice case.

The US State Department absolutely shredded pieces Trump. surprising one seemingly low-rung position created Obama went unfilled many far important ones also ignored. Well considering places better mask compliance better, I’d say it’s working good would better idiots refuse mask would eaten piranhas make world better place.   What? happy leadership Ivanka could agency eradicated smallpox globally wiped polio United States fallen far? Many feared left spoke out, White House would stop consulting CDC all, would push even dangerous policies. seen apolitical bulwark, CDC endured meddling multiple fronts officials little public health experience, Trump’s daughter Ivanka ...

Ivanka trump telling scientists can't recommend American people. Nice. every case flu covid. life worth $9 million - years ago.

That's $2.5 trillion deaths US economy already, massive. Lol- funny reading comments here-""why didnt lockdowns work-it must work Argentina worked New zealand""?

For reason wont work African countries, India developing country.People go work literally starve death. countries anything longer 2-3 week lockdown Criminal. Yeah, days ago was, think, biggest one-day increase record Europe. lot people thought would moment got tiny control.  Back spring average death took 5 weeks. I’m sure now, think turnover much higher we’re treating correctly people able move hospital. Ok, make argument toxic animal cholesterol causing heart disease, number one killer America year year out.

And lay stupid artery clogged heart, maybe finally regret eating garbage whole life. Maybe regret typing bullshit vegans acting like know something. Well, many countries can't survive long stupid. Odds make given harsher environment, it'll less them.

Also, people called developing countries know can't afford get sick average try harder stay well. antivaccination less thing, see value also acutely aware consequences getting sick diseases protect it. Would way better taking laptop toilet change scenery. masks solution? working far. everyone stayed home infections Planet Fox remember China reported 14k cases one day Feb. People freaked out. Good thing I'm gonna inside winter playing PS5. See next summerrrrr Remember people afraid go Chinese restaurants virus China? cannot count people act selflessly inthis pandemic.

Young people feel risk personally many cases developed cognitive ability realize empathize risk others.

The entire situation illustrative government must act restrict conduct. But, know......muh rights. fines need upped majorly enforced jail time repeat offence.

Why funk ""speed limit fatigue"" work way? Enforcing idiotic victimless crimes wide empty roads middle field pay fat fucks donuts? Same. asthma run 4 miles 4x week mask. really obnoxious. hope suffer consequences actions whatever may be.  wonder think Europe anything stop it. lot restrictions reinstated again. go strike. Hospitals around SF Bay Area went soft strike day two weeks ago. might something fire seasons keep getting worse worse. Good work son. Ah yes, fifth taste sense fucking way....wow, speechless. Would even war? would glassed immediately can't get drunk I'm already drunk. People interacting often indoors places poor ventilation, increase risk transmission Higher survival rates lead longer hospital stays. patient dies ICU bed immediately free. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Year's celebrations risk takers gonna spread risk averse, especially careful ones still want kind celebration year sucked hard.

Covid ain't taking time seasons greetings, every person making extra journeys shopping visiting family going help spread. Even everything delivered people chain.

You want spend Christmas New Year's hospital worrying sick family/friends? 

Good luck that. We're rounding corner faster Bruce Wayne's parents. Happy see home state CA - pacific coast northeast general - bottom list, given heavily got hit early since we're *still* taking really seriously.

My heart goes everyone SD, Idaho, etc., but... seriously, anyone whose town never got hit still naively thinks maybe C19 big deal, virus *will* get eventually. nightmare future generations study. Netherlands number hospitalizations increasing, number death increasing, patients redistributed hospitals (and even Germany) again. USA cases looking good right now, lol.  it? winning much /s boat friend. thats bad :( wishing guys speedy recovery! That’s sad, Biden play despacito Everything opened back city april may. stopped taking temperatures around time Cutting days hospital stay important risk hospitals overwhelmed sheer numbers people would result deaths. useful tool. Talk your/her doctor aspirin.   
I heard news story tonight radio they’ve seen benefits therapeutic people covid.   
(It’s blood thinner covid creates clots).     
But ask doctor. Don’t self medicate.  
    
FYI. preventative.   
   
EDIT: pretty much info heard radio.   Foreign Minister Anze Logar tested positive coronavirus Friday trip Estonia, Lithuania Latvia earlier week, state news agency STA symptoms took routine test, self-isolate 10 days well closest associates, STA said, citing statement ministry. I’m college think year first time dreaded birthday. thrilled spend supposed best time period life isolated house classes behind screen. Everybody plan get punched face.

Or, guess, plan survives first contact enemy.

This pandemic, people much ""the enemy"" virus is. plan account ""The Idiots"" throwing wrench works shit plan. estimation lot countries ""shit plans"", number dead inconsistent messaging poor emphasis. Morale crapper, people simply want return something resembling normal, therein lies crutch. wishy-washy approach pandemic strict-into-not-so-strict crap damn near designed get people pissed establishes new sense normalcy encourages defeatist thinking. point locking we're gonna ease back weeks see cases rise again?

I'm Swedish I'm happy Sweden handling precisely above. Yeah, we've got levers pull make things stricter limit mobility little, they're damn near entirely toothless individual person. Instead organizations, businesses hospitals such, they're facing new regulations require certain things like downsize demand masks, organizations another restriction conduct loads this. Restrict individual entirely banning pubs outright asking move 5 kilometers away primary residence going cause issues, individual used kind restrictions.

Not stated above, messing new natural order things prevents ""New normal"" setting damn near entirely, least short time-frame. means none becomes easier deal time, humans creatures habit amazing grow tolerate given enough time.

Nah, get pretty grain far subreddit concerned (no insult intended, we're different) truly believe stable approach preferable volatile one. Plan ahead try flatten curve; messaging beginning that's needs happen estimation. Going beyond place like Europe mixed countries would need EU wide support simply ain't happening.

I think Trump anything it, think simply element human nature deal long time.

The TL;DR said less summed this: long-term crisis happens society-wide change required, enact plan see working duration it. scale response absolutely necessary, precise time-frames rigid goals. 

Last least, disclaimer: layman, expert (that obvious, case). 'Gyna Ya nursing homes Democrat run states /s thing happened too... Except hospital isolation ""UNKNOWN RESPIRATORY ILLNESS"" phone mine. work(ed) tourists. caught testing even commonplace country. 

I told lose job, life go upside probably going able afford see while. dismissed completely told would pass globally weeks China's quarantine.

Thankfully Israel bit direct sounds like. told exactly thought fired hospital bed blocked number. 

I COVID. I'm still working. Still lockdown house. Fucking dickhead Ahahahahahahahahahaha WIPEOUT 1/5 testing coincidentally almost makes accurate based per capita ratio. it. want trials continue know vaccines work better others want placebo arm vaccinated.  here. tracking thru news. chiefs came told everyone forward desk phones cause coming back Monday. still entered Phase 2 yet way going baby loser stubborn take shot even fucking nasal spray. hard concept understand we, country, increase improve testing, find positive tests? me, like duhhh?!?? Hope worst evil pandora's box. think bottom? I’m Grand Forks, ND third biggest city. People bars, clubs, gyms without masks. Seems like mostly college students also non believers. months ago felt safer rather back home NC 🤷🏻‍♂️ point actually expose deniers reality happening. literally get dig grave. can't see it, effecting them, give af. 

If virus black cloud visible, people would avoiding shit trying stop spreading. kind comment always seems disingenuous. think there's middle ground complete shutdown riding out? need creative adapt. ignore problem pretend like going away like president doing. No. evidence something like mutating.

[Even influenza takes long time big mutations come Shift, Drift. Meaning, come **NEW** strains, rather ones mutated.

In 12ish months virus live, singular instance mutation. **very** instances reinfection (that dubious claims best little evidence).

EDIT : echo ^echo ^^echo ^^^echo ^^^^echo ^^^^^echo chamber staggering. Downvotes response. Sad fuck. Someone office (we people in-building still) family member live tested positive. informed management, told anyone. pretending happen guess. feel attacked... thought already was! country, go prison wear mask Number tests matter, % positive cases. Spread disease people sick scared getting sick vote. Putin hinted coming. Chill hell out. hear you. I'm saying locking people inside states never fly legally.  Take court. can't believe many people still anti-maskers. 10 months later least 230,000 deaths...

We need national mask mandate immediately.   Voting Trump indeed. We'll probably see 2morrow. sure next week trust guy. demeanor so...forced. fake. disingenuous. nothing behind eyes.  Yeah, well, neither spreading pandemic. give shit people murdering others germs fuck right literally everything else. remember distinctly mostly happened D&amp;D session, one last able in-person friends. I'd made whole bunch buffalo wings everyone. group thought fucking told Kobe news. Little know 2020 would bring. depressing compromise Zoom depression since then, none us truly engaged. Even hobby become hollow. Keep coping winning friend. state many others tremendously successful despite national leadership. Remind me! 1 month beginning pandemic told wear mask. told masks health care workers. 

If government would prepared respond crisis hitting nursing homes institutional settings would seen far less death.

If government program essential workers lived multi-generational households given vouchers stay hotels could saved lot lives.

Masks silver bullet required indoor activity grocery stores, post offices etc. local governments required people wear masks outdoor parks, beaches etc done harm good. 

We never closed outdoor spaces. hiking trails closed? likely spread covid hiking trail indoors family forced close outdoor space shut down. Wait Halloween look excess death count 0 October 10! heard like covid... put covid covid. here. international countries also worse ever. red blue single goddamn effect infection rates. Fuck 2 party system. Another savior foot, cold, stuck mouth. played that, knows, food, clothes, fuck I'm out! That's lot people worried about, take care good luck family. Calling ""pretend asleep"" giving way much credits. literally vegetables point. least let die peacefully freedum lmao. Bout get pitted reports try get Trump lose. whole panic attempt get Trump lose. It’s political. That's they're competent adults.  Protestors masks unbearable I’m exhausted don’t care anymore.

I’ll continue part dumb fucks refuse wear mask think hoax political scam, let culling continue. I’m it. Let chips fall may. 

Anyone hint intelligence knows pull weight meantime. going miss many opportunities say ""2020 hindsight"" already know badly fucking up. We're number 1! We're number 1! Like orgasms. There's difference individualist uneducated asshat know/care viruses work. Apparently siblings. jest, family, even liberal leaning ones, general ""got it"" yet. They'll nod say ""Oh yeah, covid this, covid that..."" find getting together dinner, going restaurants, etc... wrote email everyone stating wife think family gatherings holidays sister replied ""Why not? something happen?"" ...I kid not.

Hang there, person feels like crazy pills dealing family. Good standing ground, too. hard thing do. local governments don’t capacity enforce them, would like trying enforce ban jaywalking Gfy pos. Newsom allow anyone California get it.  help heard mentally. stupid people go die less people infect others. manu distro thats problem.

You get vaccine enough people hit herd immunity.

Around 35 percent country already refusing take it, even exist yet.

If get instantly get vaccine hands every single person country would actually take it, still enough.

We're going suffer grow fuck up. simple that. 0.6% according CDC estimates. 500 dollar fine? new rickroll

or new goatsecx Yeah thought would like MERS. come much globally quite nasty little clusterfuck Korea. Unlike SARS (which never touched Korea) MERS good dress rehearsal us COVID-19. Korea's whole massive tracing infrastructure be, erm, traced back one taxi driver sick MERS back 2015. pulled credit card records quarantined anyone who'd taxi. thing ready roll day one COVID-19 much grander scale despite fuck-ups worked pretty well allowed idiotic super-spreaders contained lot quicker. use different sub sub (r/coronavirus) registered years ago nothing COVID inception.

Wearing mask effective preventing spreading virus, really important asymptomatic folks public. lowers viral load, doesn’t make immune. told wife March we'd still dealing August/September, maybe longer.

She believe me. hate wrong. Truly single thing holding humanity back unparalleled evolution development work, co-workers wearing masks?

Hospitalizations also reached time high Midwest according COVID Tracking India still crushes US single day cases.... long winter ahead. sick winning yet!!!!!!!!!? Waiting roommates test results now. symptoms so... families friends 230,000 dead Americans need read shit like that. That's cold, heartless really fucking sad. failed state *noun*

1. state whose political economic system become weak government longer control.

I saying numbers completely unacceptable, mean USA failed state. flawed, failed. south southwest Even situation 

It's gonna impact poor Ah yes, protests known 1000’s people shoulder shoulder, many pulling masks right wearing them, screaming top lungs shooting aerosol droplets everywhere. Masks one risk factor many. They're magical viral forcefields.
No matter opinion is, mass gathering banner protecting underprivileged people feed virus kills underprivileged people unfortunate. Fuck bro. 31 people nothing? wrong you? Remember school shootings major threat last year? fuck someone make list happened since then. well played He's still saying gone soon. america. Globally, worse ever been. Regardless politics. Except, US governance system, would unconstitutional. asked boss plans coronavirus pretty early.

He told it'd big deal. Within week safety meeting mentioned it.

A week locked down. Nobody taking serious.

And people gotten tired. people say ""weak afraid virus"". say weak pretend like 220k dead big deal can't wrap head around number dead people deep down, like really deep point, virus scares everliving shit you. People can’t wear masks? Nah don’t care kwik trip. Behind masker coughing It’s true. shelling data guys don’t care. Even liberal friends going parties, restaurants, protests, etc.

We giving fight lol. We're going prisoner dilemma kinda situation states work make less tax money helping states kept tax money overflow corona austere states. 

Doesn't ultimately incentivizes everyone fork Clever girl dont get mean useless keep explaining guess need gird downvotes, I'm curious think be?

How give people speed citations? Honestly police known stopping traffick violations income generates.

If mask mandates generated income might see police pressured enforcement think would help all. evidenced historically low sports ratings recently, think safe say general population interest told celebrities. school district require students wear masks desks. fucking insane. Oh no! can’t say negative things China. social media police rush downvote. Oops late. 

I swear it’s transparent. delete anything. insane. Rounding corner without hitting brakes. think they’re saying we’re third wave. Like, first second went away. How? wrong “I don’t care you. care me” - loose translation. Thx neighbor Easter.

But say Easter. trying pod pacific NW United States, specifically Oregon. cases going down. isolated nearby 5 people whole pandemic. haven’t hugged mom 8 months protect her.

But it’s bad see two different neighbors holding church gatherings 15+ people mask 10 children backyard playing mask. aggravated church, believe mask wearing somehow religious persecution. hot button issue, also cause many spreading places. NOPE, WIKIPEDIA RELIABLE SOURCE. Good thing I'm actually right then, bet feel dumb fuck right now.  live Sweden vote left (so US would left Bernie. Far left). well aware issues (and we) disinformation post facts - conjectures nothing. publicly available stats yes - checked self corroborate post.

The data collected one transparent government agencies. nothing fishy going here. all. 

But 8,6% deaths far year directly attributed covid. That’s massive it’s way high. said - lower death rates areas outweighed whatever reasons. 

This post presentation data. draw conclusions. Maybe werent smart begin with.

Well trained selfish sheep. acquisition long term heart damage young people? How’s year Sweden? It'll least give decent people something stand on. It'll also might help people want wesr masks getting peer pressured wear wear ""yeah masks suck can't afford fine right ect"". islander went lockdown whose country maintaining nicely despite Americans flying every day -- easier nations land borders others. 

For outsiders coming covid tests fly in, arriving stay. Unfortunately France outcome less likely relies continental Europe well. England could done though. Australia too. Instead downvoting present another source see excess mortality. facts bs. disagree take. It’s like saying it’s illegal go cut open person, surgeons get it.

That said, things police need change, think isn’t good take. Trump said virus gone.  think US Federal government constitutional right mandate masks. could wrong think so. surging Sweden though. Germany almost five times fewer deaths per capita compared Sweden.

You comparing one best managed countries Europe terms covid19 containment one worst.

Sweden clearly incredible propaganda however given acceptance population disastrous strategy. live PA engineering work. lot coworkers don’t bother wear masks all. lot people see aren’t wearing masks either. Wolf hadn’t fast, we’d hell lot worse now. Yet lot people know hate shutting things. 

The suburbs cities like Philadelphia Pittsburgh battlegrounds state. It’s gonna among copy-paste McMansions, among falling leaves oaks, among historic towns landmarks centuries ago breeding grounds revolution, president decided. VOTE. see many people daily life aren’t wearing masks? sure don’t. They'd still wear masks, ones yelling tyranny would *really* smug it. commence coughing. time mandate masks February. Going induced coma feeling like crap still reduction symptoms. 

You went needing machine keep alive able yourself. clearly improvement symptoms. That's one want. trust anything made America. think help companies afraid mandating masks think could mean less customers door / boycotting.

If government back up, could put signs front entrance. Karens minority, see much internet. believe comply wants go trouble fighting it? assholes.

I'm CA Trump supporting coworker wears mask mandated. believe mask mandate, wore to, like Costco. Republican respects local public health ordinance. ""Eurasia EMEA"" (EMEA - europe, middle east asia) buddy idk sound confused. Btw europe region: comment needs attention. You’re completely right, yet people (even take virus seriously) likely blame somebody nosing mask grocery store problems fact people tired seeing friends family important. Bad people aren’t driving pandemic; people are. I'm pharmacist old enough remember US global leader pharmaceutical innovation production. shortages. None. Enter government payor demanded costs reduced. Enter changes patent laws allowed generic manufacturers make drugs cheaply without put sweat, monetary, equity innovator company invested bring drug market first place. Ever since, insurance driven pharmaceutical companies abandon low profit drugs patent favor high cost drugs cancer obscure diseases. make money stay business. Without patent protection, make sense companies make basic drugs rely upon. get generic drug manufacturers. also make money. can't make money unless outsource manufacturing someplace cheaper make. Enter China India. NDMA (a carcinogen found active pharmaceutical ingredient used manufacture several generic drugs led number recalls last year). FDA resources adequately oversee manufacturing outside US. None solutions proposed either side aisle, leadership major pharmacy organizations, work solve problem, I'm afraid. focus reducing cost, focusing allowing drug companies make money drugs develop extending patent protection eliminating mandatory generic drug substitution laws. can’t see go grocery store every Tuesday right open.

And every Tuesday, there's crew fire department getting groceries.

In April, people wearing masks, jerks roll in, pack 8, wearing masks, standing around groups various places store shooting shit one two actually shopping.

I emailed fire department it.

The next week many wore masks. “We need test random people PCR test lot false positive results, it’s safety”. Still better Portugal's US equivalency 110,000 cases reported today put faith us. RKI acknowledges aerosol transmission state exactly 0 act upon schools workplaces. Except recommending open windows every hour so. National govt argues tougher restrictions lot state leaders want endear economic interest groups stupid voter base. everybody acts late pre-emptive action seems seen treason lobbyist masters.

Hence exponential rise cases, hospitalizations ICU admissions. lot stupid people shit every precaution matters private gatherings. Currently everybody dog deludes 30k ICU beds like grandfathers deluded invincible Wehrmacht 1943. things go like trouble neighbours weeks time neighboring country turf patients to. Sweden best anything. 1960 anymore. ""robust"" bookkeeping Denmark, Norway Finland.

And yes. Triaging used elderly care. Tegnell comes brags emergency care numbers. That's cheating. like Sweden cheats PISA. 

Tegnell say words ""herd immunity"" loud (you go leaked emails foreign interviews), kept fixating immunity numbers spring summer. *say* that, also strangely fixated cheated emergency care numbers.

Russian powers argue killing dissidents public, they. Put anyone put two two together. New cases doesnt matter much scare media wants think. Hospitalizations deaths do. propaganda reducing severity coronavirus, specialist doctor stated: ""Some propaganda severity coronavirus decreased true propaganda stopped soon That's nice long way basically say every idiot saying. 

You stuck to. ""iTs bIG DeaL, kILLs oLd PeOple"". Would save everyone's time downvote ... almost like shitty people need forced right thing. bias lot confused happening around see internet TV.
The hospital said man knew died covid cancer hospital. virus.
This fact,this happened us. Something wrong here
Who knows many times happened.people getting sick yes...but NOBODY DIED.. reality.
Maybe unfortunate happened someone know died. IDK say truth.
You get mad want can't stop telling people this. We've 6 months. Trump polorized mask issue hard, mandates needed get traction Cats  Thanks telling that. get groceries delivered. Gonna start wiping again. Yup, even doesn’t directly stop someone dying. Freeing hospital beds stop people dying. biggest danger Covid hospitals overrun. big part people got mildly sick beginning pandemic get swabbed, enough swab everyone.

But also interesting research suggesting people get sick despite masks may likely get asymptomatic infections mild infections unprotected. /r/COVID19/comments/ip2gwh/facial_masking_for_covid19_potential_for/ One research hamster study, hamsters protected mask material got sick less often unprotected hamsters (20% vs 67%), ones get sick despite mask material protection milder symptoms. idea less virus enter body, easier immune system fight off. Oh man, daughter's school district facebook page constantly debates useless mask mandate ""live fear"". scared get virus, stay home.

I idea wearing mask infringes people's rights much, them. people spouting control us, sheep letting control us. Dude pandemic business here, reddit loves cock lick billionaire “vaccine philanthropic foundation”  Last house, on-street parking, I'm apartment. 

Until recently (like month ago) chargers nearby, even then, able plug overnight inconvenient. Even one slow charger. 

But, long enough range, would make driving way Supercharger little attractive... Nearest one almost 14 miles away. live here, confirm. state filled idiots. VA killed grandfather back 99. Drug interactions. I'm rooting ya. Fauci said march wear mask. people getting infected younger, healthier people (college students) whose immune systems subdue virus quickly little discomfort overall.  skews data somewhat. Agreed. portion thread really confused flabbergasted. West side best side. guess we've proved today. Would squat space better?

If data data, care posted? There’s thing rural counties called “Mom code” don’t test kids keep open. It’s disgrace, I’ve never ashamed Utahn.  see! girl EP, bit worried matter training equipment have, online learning never effective in-class. longer goes on, bigger long term damage inflicted children. That's uncomfortable truth one wants hear.  Yes no. almost complete shut ins. Still worry trips choice make. See post.

Also, think could already it/ now. weird symptoms (rashes, itching over. mom too.) pretty much symptomatic. And, go ER 2 weeks ago. So, don’t know.

For record. didn’t want go ER. But, cat asshole bit got pretty infected. Needed antibiotics. Burundi considered poor country however? virus dangerous younger, healthier adults- ones who’re going work paying taxes keep hospitals flowing money. take difficult decision go herd immunity among group, whilst completely socially isolating old vulnerable. It’s shit decision, there’s way. Everyone 65 stays isolated, let young build herd immunity us. young individual falls ill, he/she goes home quarantine. It’ll take year, method make sure economic impact minimal also make sure hospitals don’t get screwed Wisconsin actually assume motto Sturgis Bike Rally? I'd suggest amendment.

""Ride Die"" People die every day. Nobody lives forever. average age death Covid 19 like 76. i'm trying get hurt, little fun. False. virus changed one bit. get lulled falsehoods like these. still likely contract severe long-term damage body 6 months ago. devious. Trump simply think bad news helps him. ignored. He's simple man. photo Bill Gates wearing mask delete account? Yes we'll hope late January lots businesses start operate operating along well fighting people want remain unemployment fear punishment new administration assuming they'll putting new mandates place.

If Governor's know Trump can't threaten anymore they'll start close places need closed head winter. Biden pushing massive stimulus helping businesses anyone furloughed. Currently Trump there's guarantee business survive close right covid reasons. Biden support pushing back rent mortgages getting anyone work enrolled unemployment benefits likely 600-900 week people currently male jobs. stay home safe truly flatten virus' spread.  cannot horde 1 billion dollars wealth clean hands. simply cannot done. Graham Weston anyone else. thing moral billionaire. Suck freeze!

/s Man, poor fucking doctors. They’re constantly asking people follow guidance inept useless Gov Herbert wrings hands tells people “do right thing” also refusing mask mandate “people don’t like government telling do.”

It’s fucking disgrace. friends Utah mentioned previous article calling attention passed 1500 attitude “doesn’t seem representative I’m seeing; positive cases kid’s school anything.”

Right, hasn’t happened it’s happening. tried France seem work. Go coughing see react. Biggest problem risking getting sick yourself. year seems pessimistic, article leader Warp Speed says 100 million doses could ready January. experts (including Fauci) optimistic vaccine widely available mid Summer 2021 latest.

Where hear possibility ""mutagenic spread""? read lot covid-19 heard yet. Google bring anything either. Oh know sub literally censors narrative Woah woah “all people dying’ numbers increasing”?? mock anyone say something racist. one listen.  strange yet accurate metaphor. probably would’ve used vibration musical instrument describe it, significantly descriptive much fun. Excellent work. **extension pre-existing curfew 10:00 PM – 6:00 AM.**  obligation **wear mask** times region restored.  **Teleworking** made obligatory wherever possible, federal inspectors asked increase inspections see measure enforced.  **cultural venues close**, including museums, galleries, theatres cinemas.  **sporting facilities close**, including gyms, tennis courts swimming pools.  applies gaming venues: betting shops, casinos arcades.  **Amateur sporting competitions suspended**, children 12 may take part training, accompanied one adult bring event.  time, **school excursions cancelled**, including take place outdoors.  **shops must close later 20.00**, except takeaway restaurants, may stay open 22.00 (although staff customers aware curfew).  **People must shop alone**, two exceptions: unless accompanied minor age 12, accompanying person requires assistance.

This always going go way going. see 300k-400k deaths time vaccine accessible everybody. Americans stubborn simply listen. 

The fucked part worn masks day one, could kept businesses open, kept economy going, kept numbers infected dead down. needed take seriously start. 

Look places numbers going since ""reopening"". people saw things reopening treated ""it's over"". Florida, hardly closed. care people saying, live hardly anything closed. people masks. 80% 60% stores maybe 10% outside. 

We Americans never going take seriously, collective. fucking shame too, would grow adults once, could accomplish whole lot more. Lol sniffles took covid test gave list people incontact with.... tested negative. 

Stop spewing falsehoods please. Like popcorn popping apricot tree. Probably say that. desperately needs hear it.  Ok wimp Exactly  wasn’t angry them. fact, hoping right overreacting. good news bad? numbers get confusing  doubt current one gets tested often all. get number from?

Pretty sure president get tested every day part job. better ready. What, Macron textbook neoliberal.  Even 1 500, take year hit famed herd immunity level. shows crazy idea is. also substantial evidence grouped “the left” together based one person’s sentiment.   270,000 people dead. post spot on. leaked info China. meant scare video created falun gong? understand they're funded either US gov cost right? Google epoch times trump.

Their propaganda make sense contradicts constantly. ones behind 5g coronavirus thing. (5G created China) Ducey don’t really care think tbh. thresholds pain. Mine low. don’t need justify anything don’t get guilt life don’t fucking care. Imagine emotionally stunted accost random person online who’s clearly struggling. don’t want see vents, fucking scroll. It’s “lockdown skeptical” folks got us shit pile. Congratulations, got wanted. don’t follow guidelines made evil authoritarian libs we’re stuck situation several years social distancing restrictions hurt fee-fees. Maybe wear mask me, handle it. Sex trafficking dangerous game. Speeding exactly safe. Also, what's point? think federal government power? article says figured contact tracing. Yet another thing US could help slow spread. Maybe stop worrying something zero control over. hysteria surrounding shit many things kill people yearly probably generally either don’t think don’t give shit astounding. Someone mentioned large reserve activated. 

However everywhere issue beds workers. get worse get sick, operating plastic tubes apparently extremely risky. Here’s Biden’s find weird much Pro-Sweden stuff is.

Are best example country that's handled well? think so. New York reopened soon.

Covid grabs NY deadly grip. soft lockdown. need force people things willingly.  Never food China us.

We would way knowing we're contact tracing US. happen refuse **should**? amazing time whole world fucked simultaneously... think lack testing India. many densely populated poor areas doubt testing groups significant. false.

For example, trump gop refuse authorize payments Americans help weather storm, gop won’t even allow vote democrat plan passed house back May. Biden, hand, would prioritize payments. Biden’s Biden Plan provide financial support economically harmed fall-out crisis help strengthen economy whole. includes taking immediate, bold measures help Americans hurting economically right now. means need bigger broader measures shore economic demand ensure protect jobs; keep credit flowing job creators, economic firepower need weather storm get people economy back full strength soon possible. 
These immediate measures include direct federal support renewable fund state local governments. federal state/local relief designed automatically extended upon certification federal government continuing health economic threat, determined clear health economic criteria. critical ensure political legislative stalemates prevent additional rounds funding moving swiftly needed most. logic could applied literally slightly risky activity people daily

I’m responsible making sure others behave responsibly. I’m responsible safety safety family. 

I aware everyone else control doesn’t make better. RUINED credibility NEEDED credibility. 

How trust he’s lying something else “for good”? first go then. Stupid weak. Kill two corvids one covid. Imagine weak-willed lamenting possibility death virus even kills fraction fraction percent people even catch Yeah Sweden like Vermont/Maine US. Spread generally keep themselves. We've labeled either crazy used goods. first. thought comment it... conclusion is, matter Political Party support, negativ test someone good news. Nobody suffer covid imo. negativ test, someone suffer, good news. would flair post celebrity like tested negativ also good news. sensitive double Standards ""people"" wish someone harm harm feelings Political view person share info nothing support. Sorry english think understand core message. argument beem get especially system overburden beyond first wave outside select places. even get high going magically stop least 30% less deadly. cdc already warming things getting worse. People accuse others virtue signaling generally projecting selfishness others. lol... hurt you?

China probably catching cases country billion plus people. However, hearing mass deaths hospitals overflowing there. Deaths hard cover up. think agree virus control there. seriously consider instead automatically assuming covering western countries terribly virus. Mandated St Louis months ago. First day, police standing inside local Walmart. Anyone walked without mask handed disposable one $300 ticket. don’t believe (based comment history) are, go you. Vaccinator* man midnight cities got mobile tent hospitals went unused. captain orange fucked even provide hospitals nursing homes adequate PPE

no fauci governors failed. years prepare states proper PPE supplies. Yet, that. blame everyone making sure states ready. President Trump supported states got praise it. Governors mad forced take accountability lack preperation. Lmfao including USAs excess deaths par Belgium, tiny country much dense population, thats insane. USA waaaaay worse Good.

We need lock America too. Fair enough. reacted claim one else (a really angry person) “year date fewer dates normal”. (currently) factually correct universe. 
Have good night!  outlets US state propaganda. Remember op ed justified iraq war? There's easy one. Maybe America ACTUALLY ENFORCE ANYTHING. lack accountability country astounding. Yep always drive red lights. right here. needs go ways. “Why doesn’t America New Zealand does”.  biggest one-day increase record everyday now.. I'm forties bedbound degenerative illness four years. Six months ago stopped able tolerate bathed sponge washed bed.  bedroom hospital visits via ambulance.  dressed hard body days. Sometimes can't feed myself, times can't swallow food.

I would cry happiness could one last load washing, cut vegetables, wash dishes, let alone ski day, dance, sex partner turned full time carer.

The sicker I've gotten, isolated, actual conversation friends makes crash take weeks recover from.  

For months sympathy everyone falling depression isolation confinement indoors.  honestly? I'm getting sick hyper privileged motherfuckers. everyone - literally millions us - horrific illness horrifically underfunded, think physically mobile people allowing get mentally crushed relatively petty restrictions life covid lockdown whining pussies *need systematically take responsibility mental health*. Look timing articles. Warm crowd case Biden wins. Mandates without consequences meaningless, sheriffs country refusing enforce. say fire sheriffs. wind bread line, others start following orders superiors. people’s views beliefs.

Yeah, I'm going respect beliefs they're dangerous people. people died strictly already said it’s power play. want total control civilians totally defenseless push legislation want upon us without push back. 

Again, childish thinking. Mandating masks cause facist regime rise overnight. That's real world works. Maybe grow graduate high school, understand. thought Macron progressive.

Is bad Trump? France soon gonna surpass India daily number rate. Either India testing enough extremely well (compared France) lying put ball gags everyone doesn’t comply. country telling us wear masks start Yeah, that's reason anybody would ever go way someone else right, there's something them? National least. Well sure going hard fly atlanta actually this; hoard many hoarded 500 them. 

&amp;#x200B;

They got harder sell third party seller sites deleting posts selling N95 masks would keep reposting. 

I got lucky couple customers Jersey Astoria, made thousand returned rest store. kept 50 masks personal stock that. People start taking seriously hits family, friends community. proof knew early amazon receipt contagion january want nightmare end talking pandemic seem happen every 100 years so. One year seeing family going kill it? use zoom, Skype etc see family Cool. Explain give vibe “nice girl”. need mass testing damn time noooooo You’re extremely stupid. confirm rural hospital husband works capacity sending patients nearby larger hospital three weeks. Again...... sad. Even universal mask ""wearing"" still large portion wear right. Noses uncovered, chin, hanging ear, around neck, paper thin neck gaiters, wadding purse pocket, taking cough sneeze etc etc..... 

Universal masking ""wearing"" universal mask wearing! 😣   Yeah I've also wondered that. take look maps heute RKI border areas look definitely hit harder ones sharing one. infections widespread they're now, difference dissipate soon. Certainly rural people like this. point decades surveys electoral results showing rural Americans much conservative political, religious, cultural views urban dwellers. 

Just look electoral map past 30 years. Major metro areas universally dark blue rest country deep red. 

I’m sure rural people feeling like looked city dwellers fact farmers grow food this. people job (doctors, sanitation workers, engineers, plumbers, delivery workers) equally important society. Unfortunately Wisconsin leading charge way cases. 7 day average deaths gone 4 9/24 24 today. Average cases gone 1900 cases per day (16.7% positive) 3400 (22.1% positive) time period. Today local radio traffic report said ""we currently seeing pre pandemic levels traffic"". 3 counties ""very high"" covid spread minimal stop spread. imagine month now, currently models levels sign stopping. hope start realizing pandemic real serious take seriously. like police telling yeah bad wife, we're little short resources, conduct murder investigation.

Welcome minority America.  I’m Mormon don’t mentality leaders always wear masks ask others well; “Mormon” acting describe would ignoring leaders, regardless I’m sure idiots Utah Mormon, all.. religion isn’t reason. People going lockdown families 8+ months. unfair expect visit family. math prob that’s 1 3600 Americans testing positive. Today. It’s story tells can't put long Somebody keeps saying we've yet see corner, let alone get close enough round it. happens refuse test. Bullshit. 

You testing way europe.

nearly 400k/1milion test total. 

France 220k/million tests total.

From bigger countries (10milion +) uk Pilot testing. 4 counties tested around 180 000 people expected get tested. 1st day three day testing, 62 000 tests(40k number 5pm, testing ended 8pm). Thats good. Frequency, proximity, duration, intensity?  Two weeks! Sounds like could use [a Foreign social media influence help either. pretty clear there's strong active campaigns derail lockdown efforts. sturgis there? taste (just deadened) really subtle point didn’t fully realize coming ten-day cycle. fatigue epic. related efficiency though. E.g. ATMs people normally give lot space there's much work involved. shops everybody trying get closer want put wares lane fast possible.

Not good idea pandemic... real. real,

It's bad say. bad,

It'll go away. doesn't,

It affect people age. does,

It affect personally. does,

I probably die. do, well, know care. mean, *that* funny... I’m MD know it’s prophylactic, even original intended use, broad-spectrum antiviral medication available prescription. 

It approved label use respect Covid (e.g. US countries. would need search online respect live. Hang there! Trump says we’re turning corner now! use privledge Yeah chance. I’ve busted balls shit. I’ve done everything can. gets stage frankly vulnerable get everyone else’s way. I’ve vaccine I’m thing regardless rules. economy people’s mental health won’t last another two years something quite frankly could happen time. can’t go restrictions even six months. aren’t vulnerable life shouldn’t impacted. sad part people (experts) saying would dissipate summer banking seasonal returning fall even summer quiet. never meant say pandemic would summer. never mentioned temperature. Schools reopening could certainly factor, well people coming back vacation places undetected COVID community transmission. coincidental cases started rapidly increasing everywhere Europe time cases US started increasing well. treat surgically removing Facebook account. anti vaxxers women? Deep State.....Something....Something.....Q......Something......Virus Hoax......Something

There easy peasy. recognize tremendous pressure even threats life family, can’t understand Birx cut administration much slack every day. truly feels Admin sacrificing lives needs go National TV state Americans attack need change top ASAP. would like requiring poll workers degree political science.

You know what, better give Republicans ideas... What’s normal? I’m ok wearing masks indefinitely long open entirely. Thing don’t understand is, Hilary omnipotent mastermind fuck couldn’t beat Trump? It’s classic GOP paradox left simultaneously comically inept also dangerous people planet pulling strings behind closed doors. sounds like wonderful woman love much. family sympathies. Getting together Thanksgiving (or whatever holidays ya'll celebrate) kind dilemma. living Europe really worried US situation. initially strong reaction virus across region summer higher temperatures hours sunlight allowed lot activity reduction restrictive measures, coming autumn seeing cases spike again. US lack coordinated response widespread antimasking covid denying ideas made summer cases growing places, result colder season look good US often times businesses shuttle route served one two airlines curious, ever lose taste smell?  got tested Austin free line results back evening 10 hours. personal anecdote. Well article specifically talks nasal lining perfect receptor viruses set shop raise family, point stands. fact we’re gearing towards going back trying function normal concerning fuck. Oh that’s going work well. Same! It’s damned do, damned don’t situation, think lockdowns reasonable also see wanting go right one knowing probably another wave winter divide new cases positivity rate numbers look like? 10% positive 100 tests bad 1% 1000 tests. do, though citing Wikipedia one hell choice. However, policy capacity covid. no, know he's talking about. say that...with attitude?! ""Alright bab, fancy popping over? I'm steaming vag, I've got spare pipe like."" Known “get fucked” doctrine. ""participant’s stroke deemed unrelated"" comforting. I’m gonna play radio work come Monday. Sheep keep taking masks  protest fueled neofascist movement; little democracy. countries pumping money economies would hard assess. Main point soft approach second time failed, cost Victorians much long run, economically mentally. 

It's 109 days since softer lockdown started 83 days harder lockdown. first 26 days, COVID-19 cases roughly doubled. turn made recovery harder longer hard lockdown. I'm guessing doubled lockdown time needed, would interesting see modelled properly.

This generalisation significant factors like bad contact tracing systems early too. Bad bot lol Completely different parts state. Also number people protesting orders magnitude smaller number people yoloing bars. afraid mental health? Lockdowns brutal individuals.  clearly working! Trumpsylvania He's afraid smelling breath. mouth stinks high heaven.  test! Let's keep whore this.  concerned. around long enough effects considered 'long-term'. fatigued like 3 months, 100% (probably more, started working fitter got sick). got February FYI. Oh   
my   
god


I may never stop laughing. 

""Sister Steam:  
Take advantage opportunity steam together friend.""

WHY FUCK WOULD WANT THAT??? Meetings accomplish little.  Ask Dilbert... north border Winnipeg we're great either. summer almost went 2 weeks without single case city...we went best country one worst. kept small portion money

So like 5%?  really hoping (naively) fall/winter ~~wave~~ tsunami would largely wait ;(  apologize getting nasty. I'm passionate something important lives wish protected everyone. Even like behaviors like woman article. 

I hope good evening well :) telling there's difference severity two statements:

* Sweden ICU beds.

* One hardest hit regions (out 21) run ICU beds.

So case literally ain't bad seems, regions Sweden cooperate shuffle people need arises (as spring). several FB friends - well-educated, intelligent people - gathering socially modestly-sized parties family gatherings, well “unofficial homecomings”, kind thing. I’m sure people wear masks public (I’m area mask mandate virtually everyone does), baffles think it’s ok gatherings. We’re Ohio, rising cases. get impression people think *their* friends family couldn’t it. It’s always *other people* it. Either mindset they’re going get anyway, might well get with. Christ, candy?

Emotion aside, yes candy. Candy physical object passed hands, not? 

Good-luck though, yall gonna need lmao. merit state population? amount food produces? he/she/it/they never answered asked preferred pronoun would  locked economically ruined we? 

Well, 58% people country poverty (less 300 usd per month). it’s much worse, currency went worth 40 dollars 195 today. without considering ridiculous amount taxes used ridiculous programs one uses, politicians earning multiple hundreds thousands pesos per month. way problems, people fed up. incredibly selfish. Wow... too, too.
:( true, patients died well.
1 3 showed severe side effects placebo.
1 5 showed severe side effects remdesivir.
They failed chinese study patients receiving high flow oxygen intubated.
Either way studies good. feel awful many people report deaths every day still people even believe it. France Belgium say hi. oh shit know was

&amp;#x200B;

edit: misread, damnit It’s like Chernobyl except human death toll way higher nobody’s even bothering hide Oh go... Lotta people claiming bad SARS. hopium run strong entire time.

And said hopium causes people constantly underreact late, oh can't get worse. 

I also like bargaining people declare done virus. Among many hopeful, maybe realistic, hopes.

Hope. That's real shit though. People going partying Halloween, weeks later they're going whole family Thanksgiving. Christmas shopping parties full blast must fight war Christmas, right new years eve parties end year. Shit's get sideways.  Well running things 75+ would get since biggest risk. vast majority high risk folks either get vaccine decline it, Im ok higher numbers. zinc might different kind business people think of. takes 5 man hours order (regardless size, account accounting, inventory, shipping, etc) plus say one man hour per 1,000 product might start forcing orders certain size ship cost effectively. case would better 1,000 pound order 5 dollar one, since would take six hours owrk 31 deaths? That's nothing. I'm pretty sure people murdered every night Chicago  Infections exponential absence outside influence. People's behavior changes things start effecting personally (regardless government action). question quickly bad gets significant changes made. Well, drank every day quarantine. Pretty heavily. Two days home quit. started drinking water day instead. Also, went work would eat takeout almost every single day, sometimes twice gf started cooking healthy. think things able slim down. 

During summer couple hiccups, start whole process over. However, I’m pretty good spot again. Besides world still falling apart. Amen lie suffering days, pain eventually ends. Europe went yolo opening economy shitter, trusting people smart safe guess(?) I’ve watching FX’s Strain 2014. pre-COVID entertainment doesn’t feel dated lol. It’s funny CDC always portrayed like badass scientific geniuses TV film, yet irl they’re like boring governmental body tied bureaucratic incompetence. know NEW individuals testing positive? includes retests? Totally different story either way one talks Yep I'm you, north Dallas. Homebound instacarting anything need. go store drive thru food whenever necessary. looking around know pandemic. There's even freaking traffic jams people taking seriously. (prev) healthy 21 year old still recovering 5 weeks fact... I'm terrified future short long term Easter 2021 actually want happen. People dying either way, many getting sick poor management people never danger.

I'd rather die knowing making nurse sick job. FUCK YEAH WINNING Winning what? nothing compared many Europe countries. *Julius Caesar entered chat* Yes. husband worked Friday 13th tattoo event 03/13 (he's artist, worked reception). I'm pretty dang sure day country announced national emergency. remember feeling dread getting ready craziness day (this event usually draws 300+ people 400 square foot building 14 hours). also remember wearing mask ""they work."" God, stupid me.

About week later, day job sent entire office 4k people wfh husband took leave absence. He's still back yet, even though shop open. We're Florida he's got underlying conditions. feel safe worse part knowing will. **Oct. 24, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* True would awesome realistically. USA nearly many confirmed cases single day China total - China got slammed virus back Jan-Feb.

Inb4 ""CCP hiding cases!"" - there's almost certainly undocumented cases, I'm comparing confirmed cases confirmed cases (and like USA catching cases either) guess i'd say election day one shocked. Shocked say! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’re right. hate people act like actual human beings crisis historical scale significance. asking federal government take action also going nowhere many factors play:

\- Naples felt covid effect, first lockdown called numbers high north almost non existent south. would second lockdown actual first hand experience virus. Imagine easy would still believe flu. 

\- Naples always poorly run city, lots poor people would know survive second lockdown.

\- Naples hands Camorra, would surprised Camorra promoting riots cause lockdown would mean slowdown profits. probably tell people attacking police cars tonight probably waiters, restaurant owners hairdressers “If something else, besides greatest response country world, could it.”
- Donald Trump people blame government stupidity, wore masks, practiced distancing, limited outings. What's really annoying lot bans still place, sometimes countries never put bans place places cases days Korea. mean preferable it’s clear asking people mitigate behavior experiencing law diminishing returns.

There needs alternative strategy. idiots cheered police attacking protestors months ago completely flip opinions. Totally anecdotal I’ve seen helps people. It’s definitely cure, seems give bodies fighting chance. Maybe I’ll feel differently it’s well-studied, right would like get remdesivir I’m unlucky enough hospitalized Covid. Maybe indoor gatherings less evaporation / dilution throughout air virus colder. home bound since Jan. /Feb.

Now blessing strong business run home. 50/50 custody 6 children pick drop times month.

In areas south Dallas, Tx. never looked like shut down, vacation days work. Stores packed people everywhere. 6% CONFIRMED INFECTIONS. words, 1% less actual infections require hospitalization. Also that, can't summon lockdown without plan reports.. say ""still found virus X amount days"".. giving day virus disappeared, they're giving last day checked virus stopping test looking further.. says virus still detected 7 8 days, length test, virus..

These REALM research results.. read ones entities articles popping length lasts surfaces.. one currently link to, relates  understand people would protest \[the lockdowns, is\], even agree it. one. know breaking crying work professional thing would want take orders someone that. remember getting banned week (very left-leaning) forum ""inciting panic"" saying 100k dead possible worst case scenario. Another climb Bone's Wild Ride! can't take winning anymore, want ride. text sent friend virus January 23rd. remember browsing China Flu subreddit yet. Exactly, let's see many older relatives try guilt everyone still getting together Thanksgiving. Welp, time brush Mandarin... both? Humans also evolved take care one another delay gratification planning thinking logically. expose family COVID several members die result? exact scenario happened countless times pandemic. Please careful. provide context, Argentina locked since March, people absolutely mentally economically ruined point. fifth country cases. economical sanitary failure. GTFO, FDR context quote different situation currently facing due Trump. You’re brain dead  hurt child? I'm guessing colder weather forcing indoor gathering Meanwhile NJ 80 dollars tested me. Broooooooooo! fuck?! That's true.

It's kind flash point really. Asian countries crushing us comes collective good. whole crisis like microcosm Asia replacing West preeminent power. schools reopening, parents signing in-person instruction, people pushed back office. It’s going apocalyptic winter, half us heads sand whole time. called company sells them? done? ""we rounded final turn"" - Trump reference pandemic o_o That's fair point. ever going buy us time. still managed squander evidence would ready fall all. Likely even less ready, strange say, Trump would called victory April never given another thought. Sort of. kind expected way since deals virus replication inflammation disease about. However insufficient evidence whether could help clear virus faster shorten transmission period mild cases don’t require hospitalisation. remdesivir injection, can’t dish like Tamiflu outpatients; one severe enough hospitalised given it. Remember impeachment? also happened year. It’s insane time alive America (and rest world, especially here). ended Easter.

Easter 2021 yes. Wasn’t way around? **As far know** , virus case dangerous winter. She’s emotionally unstable would want president? wouldn’t want boss breaks cries meetings would you? OB/GYN appt today, rescheduled July. use discount one-ply paper towel quality gown drape, laundry staff got Covid banned hospital. Nah, huge outbreak SD April. tons tourists visiting Mr Rushmore (and politicians...) every day.

And it’s impossible socially distance meat packing plants shit ton meat packing plants Dakotas. Lots chicken farms feedlots. Lots low pay, high risk jobs bosses care profits safety. 

Sturgis didn’t help wasn’t instigator. going magical Christmas right Americans headed dark winter.

This Fauci Osterholm's statement, Biden parroted said (not saying wrong, Biden's). 👏👏👏👏👏 Man, 10 months country still gotten right. Yea people weak. I’ve wearing mask 10+ hours day 5 days week since freaking May job. whenever go public place like grocery shopping. even better use curbside options still wear mask. Would rather be? course. idiots complain wearing mask 10-30 minute shopping trip “mysteriously g breathing issue prevents them” like cut bullshit Sandy. Don’t want wear mask, don’t go places require them. Don’t complain yell teenagers tell can’t let store. know rules, they’re plastered local news, signs building entrances, internet. Call sheep want, least empathy flock wolf decimating expected 9/11 kind rallying effort.

No, virus. rally brown people. Lol half family lives China they’re back normal, almost complete eradication. Maybe numbers fake they’ve done really well, infinitely better US, everything back normal  cases, positive tests, thing. husband thinks this. It’s frustrating feel like election it’ll gone news therefore he’ll think win it’s talked therefore it’s gone. Update: 14,714 new reported cases RKI (German CDC) comparing single country entire continent. meant play words, sounded like, “the Dude abides” Project much. far they’ve done well. pandemic far over. [Right free sites. need get doctor’s referral able go. Sometimes free sites inconvenient locations long lines, people prefer go paid site. wifi amazing afterlife yo mistaken contents news significance. We're waiting results phase 3 trials. that. so? year probably bad we've rain...

Also everything already burnt. Testing US increased steadily positive rate also increasing steadily Given positive rate bit higher July, real cases probably bit lower real ones back then. Taking antibiotics result contracting c.diff.. :( Germany also 12.700 ICU surge capacity enacted week’s notice. Fingers crossed reach point understanding, code open source search take look technology - called bluetrace something... 

Right now, Singapore 2 kinds contact tracing, tracetogehter, sorts pings devices 

within 5m thus stores device info, however GPS location tracking.

The method sort QR code gets scanned every indoor location go - malls/offices/shops/shops malls etc.

Interesting point rewards, past govt wanted people exercise, was(and still think) health app connects walking steps tracker see much steps activity done week. gotten usd20 month vouchers using app. caveat need register using ID. you’re saying testing = cases? Nope! anti-lockdown protests taking place world recently

Protest March Berlin August protest Berlin August 29th: London couple weeks one London month massive protest protest Slovak Hooligans protest coronavirus Naples, Italy anti lockdown rioters assault 22nd anti lockdown protests 9 months least 6 months since I’ve seen familiar face. 

At point, hope survive long enough see nieces chances seem like slim zero.

Why nobody seem care? Totally forgot Tom Hanks part. remember seeing phone gym thinking ""wait, even gym right now?"" European approach lockdowns really better? kick road, people tired less likely comply measures. Regeneron, took hospital stay, originally tested embryonic stem cells. I'm so, tired. I'm essential worker red county, every day come contact hundreds people give shit even seen high risk friends 6 months. I'm tired. miss friends. I'm sick protect people give fuck making minimum wage I'm it. Mark made us failed state allowed foreign enemies (iran, russia, china) infiltrate elections plant trump. racist orange asshat hates libtards, hates muslims, loves jews, hates blacks, hates browns, loves whites, incites bigotry, vulgarness, smirks asked denounce these. spineless nation sit back watch asshat work white nationalistic magic base real working class america (italians, blacks, latinos, indians) get slaughtered tail light gone trumps blue army Funny yesterday, defending high case numbers ""we run tests countries"" many guys had? Aren’t guys fully operational now? trust political talk show hosts doctors talk show host makes feel strong informed, doctor makes realize they've weak foolish. nah b, idea comment post, ok werk went check Invisalign (clear plastic braces). office took lot precautions felt pretty safe. would make decision based prone getting cavities. you’re type need filling every couple years, would go in. Otherwise, no. Okay might bit ignorant looking discussion. rising cases necessarily bad thing? understand means we’re testing. can’t bad thing right? saw stats yes testing gone positive tests deaths trending downward. half population flat-out refusing wear masks, can't stop them. can't throw 50% country's population jails, mass fines cause devastating poverty crisis middle worst economic disaster country's ever seen.

They'll keep getting away can't stop them. Finally, Belgium better something France Netherlands! /s Like Presidents corona president/federal government isn’t going anything anyway, state/local government afraid roll back earnest threat right-wing terror election, blame people. really want people stop gathering, need tighten restrictions actually enforce them. I’m terrified things look like Thanksgiving don’t start bend curve. I’m afraid may running time then. best hope might much snow it’s hard folks travel holiday. know load people who's windows open onto pavement that's always busy. seems like terrible advice.

Agreed. Makes sense traffic people INSIDE window larger traffic people OUTSIDE window.

You're basically lowering viral load replacing air ""better air"". like people forgot virus spread mostly surfaces. 

When last time sanitized phone ID? wash hands touching money? Whoa man, know story partner's story... seeing partner overkill lol. Yeah, people coming together common cause help really idiotic revolting. /s vaccine makers idea long level protection last,
😹😹 see complete win!  put whose better/worse bed good see data countries see policies strategies working. viable solution would recuperator cycles air without making freezing cold inside. you’re running money force shut business virus becomes secondary. you’re gonna care anymore. There’s always tipping point. lockdowns stop right now

Or - - I'm sure think sounds like crazy talk - - could *give money people told stay home*, financial strain intolerable. would ask district SA since many, probably district Shelter old vulnerable, let rest us get back normal.

Unfortunately since many Americans fat like 75% population already preexisting issues bad time COVID going ""get back normal"". not? 

If there's anytime something like that, worldwide pandemic million dead, likely couple million dead soon. 

I think almost ANYTHING beats alternative ""ride out"" let another couple million (or more) die. Watch daily 9/11 indifference many people.

I feel like media desensitized people much. Iraq Afghanistan coverage likely start. first victims got good coverage following years news felt like minor notice. ""Hey btw people died""

I remember lot stuff early 2000s earlier news coverage different. example Columbine DC Snipers. Even events birth toddler years memory coverage anniversaries.

But that? Vtech, Parkland, Aurora, PulseNC news coverage indifferent, left memory something like ""Many people died""

Look many crimes humanity China commiting happened Crimea. 80 years ago world would taken action nowdays big indifference.

I simply understand people cannot see proportions pandemic heading to. historical big numbers like casualities victims example WW2 also consider war lasted several years.

The pandemic even one year old already beaten several records.

The media publishes numbers, lot speculation, academic grifter reports things might really important focus.

Reinfections, long term effects, virus still present cells ACE2 receptors, baby born Covid-19. That's stuff need look at.

Just look long took fully understand HIV/AIDS nonsense written understood. Stay strong seek help feel need I'd true? Why? get titer last booster. said makes absolutely zero sense reply response comment. deleted. claim got many downvotes people Reddit ""can't think hivemind"". Never considering possibility could wrong saying. 

You claimed 99.9 percent cases harmless result death, need open carry live fear. living reality right now, say make sense? seem understand *even* everything open like pandemic - people would still jobs livelihoods would greater risk people ultimately care human life money. arguing Covid barely threat human life make true, makes look lost comes discussion. 

At end day saddest thing putting blame people value health safety instead blaming government actually responsible supporting citizens. 

Privilege - affected personally Covid, therefore demonizing would like protected public health crises using mental health economy race props blaming media prove delusional self serving rhetoric control life. 

If feel supported this, genuinely feel compassion believe suffer, mentally, physically, financially. solution downplay threat, ignore severity, blame healthcare measures, blame media, blame people wanting safe, call people white supremacists. solution work together best protect other, sooner page, sooner actually get back sort normal. everyone's efforts vain. genius.jpg little testing back actual number would far far higher.

Also R rate well 1 sarcastic. feel anti vax disqualify ~~working~~ humanity called one leader knew beforehand kept dark. go  better US plan hope avoid civil war. That's Windows make susceptible viruses.

Everybody knows that. Yes. Case count irrelevant.

While less 1% contract may die, 99% us lives live freedom enjoy. 8000 seems like nothing now. Sweden comparatively worse it’s peers. mean Europe Italy worse deaths per excess mortality Sweden highlighted among Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium, England, Spain Italy. Sure enough Sweden saw large number deaths spring along rest Europe, please explain mean *Sweden comparatively worse peers*. sending link worldometers landing page bit lazy, like expand argument there? Tawebber1 referencing US president Donald Trump bragged early 2020 pandemic would “gone Easter.” staff what? create improvised air filter around 50 dollars. Stick box fan MERV 16 filter block like 99% 1 micron particles. Yeah HEPA air purifiers use better filter DIY air purifier filters air. Goddamnit, again? Ikr, halloween. Halloween biggest holiday, year decided dress hand candy (just table small bags candy kids come take) hold party like normally do. Already family members trying guilt trip something halloween I'm going risk health even numbers low atm live. ban jaywalking regardless merely ban possible penalties deterrent effect. absolutely enforce ban places creates safety issues. Growth accelerated slightly last 14 days.

No, growth seems accelerated factor two 14 days ago. know aligns higher positivity rates? want sure increase due part increase testing. Hospitalizations deaths probably better metrics, guess see happens those. Second wave. Natural cycle viral pandemic. one day gonna disappear like miracle. Duda dies? 57 sunny tomorrow London. Warmer am. 

Obviously winter progresses possible. like others said, must consequences order reinforce behavior. C’mon people, Pavlov figured centuries ago

E - it’s easy sounds. E.g., effect $3000 fine means wealthy people immune.

Maybe graduated fines based income level? constitutional? Last checked, rich people *expressly* protected class. (In practice yes, statement ridiculous)

It something would prompt near universal compliance spite demographic factors. Lie down. Stop inhaling. Rescue Boris. That's low humidity causes nose inner lining susceptible getting infected. bs spreading lol Cold weather = people spending time indoors, avoiding cold outside. people small space perfect environment spread diseases. That's flu season predominately winter months. sure downvoted. similar feelings. Definitely wearing masks planes even pandemic one paid students take tests him? know parties, I'll occasionally 1 - 3 friends house days. mask go store non-essentials went something. I've accepted level risk.

I lived total isolation six fucking months. Worked home, saw nobody, went nowhere. partner six years lives 15 minutes away may well thousand miles.

I'm introvert far beyond introversion. That's solitary confinement. sustainable 12+ months. can't it. too. Thank comment. reminded even French Revolution...They recently said, ""Do tracing."" Dear God....! said would pay that, never said should, pay less. 
It sum spend anything makes happy really. basicly hobbies, internet, phone, tv, alcohole. 

You still paying internet atleast paying enough. 

Look Obviously even trying understand point here. Yeah, dare people hate billionaires, might one day! many could never feel difference? Mexico North America. Maybe meant say Latin America. Yeah, moved South Korea end February convinced might worst mistake could make. turned around watch US explode moment stepped plane. STEEM held March 2020, BLURT account Blurt.blog Username dont think mask requirements public transport outside Oslo. insane. We've 27,484 cases Australia since started, state Victoria pretty strict lockdown regulations last months. 83,000 unfathomable me.    Rejecting facts hurt fragile feelings stop proving wrong. makes coward. “We’re going win much you’re going sick tired. You’re going say, ‘Please, please, Mr. President, we’re sick tired winning. Please let us least one loss. It’s longer exciting win.’ I’m going say, ‘No way, we’re going keep winning, don’t care like not.’”

— Donald J. Trump, 2016 many numbers. mind boggling. think best way see compare every country per capita, anywhere that? remember country single digit cases people panicking newspapers reporting great detail case might gotten it. soon became hundred cases day ‘oh ok’ that? Constructively destructive  UK island nation Covid rife sure island it. IWNDWYT! leaders spectacularly failed guy’s generation. 

I hadn’t even thought it’d like college can’t anything normal. 

This isn’t going away years. virus economic impact. 

Sorry man, really fucking sucks. 

But hey! age, went 9/11, years later worst economic depression since Great Depression graduated... so! Ummm... yeah point. leadership fucking sucks. times Republican won’t ever forget this. 34 I’m STILL trying recover shit meanwhile europe still ahead us said one day still first one. hit elderly homes everywhere. amount deaths elderly homes higher neighboring countries per. capita  According Trump. situation Australia terrible.... single digits whole country... one new case yesterday think last two paragraphs meant, couldn’t communicate well enough haha. think sometimes case tests used interchangeably different definitions mind least find confusing. Relax. death rates low. Hospitalization rates low  e-mails! Y’all flattening curve wrong axis mate. Land freedom... Probably much freedom people can’t adhere rules. [Napoli, ultras ed 

Also literally created facebook event that. stupid🤦🏻‍♂️ spread virus around like shit. trying goes side... Trump handled plandemic well Dems making even bigger numbers before. part got entire world conspiracy amazing too. I've number countries around world since started every single one hoax. great leader could organize worldwide effort. fair, warn would much winning would beg sources 12-20 people personally know retested ""got"" corona. go twitter got 850 posts hour topic? Nice EU approved help plan rich countries want mostly mediterranean problem. Seems northern Europe gonna tough time all. remember watching Hopkins dashboard religiously back March, soon shit 100k global thought ""we absolutely fucked."" It’s FDA approved medication help people quit smoking. helps people quit that’s great thing. it’s obviously extremist bullshit 24 US states people discriminated denied employment simply using FDA approved medication. Hi! I've read article wanted tell I've Total Antibodies Covid19 IGG antibodies yet. I've various food allergies, including Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Oral Allergy Syndrome. According perspective understanding, total antibodies body covid19 must cross reactivity either food protein structure maybe immunity(antibodies) type Coronavirus virus similar protein structure covid19. 
So maybe soon come contact Covid19 body immediately attacks Coronavirus allow multiply since IGG yet, might get covid19 &amp; body keep attacking letting multiply surpass immune system! I've figured out. might correct! know joking, reason balls placed outside body need kept cool want stay fertile.

No idea ball steaming folk-medicine method temporary contraception, want try it. much different situation 6 months ago.*

Then Trump letting get even worse? What? Waiting happen America! Waiting every developed country universal health care. /s beginning Nah, understanding follow like people getting infected. Sure get one hundred thousand people post sad video regretting party killed two family members. 99,999 aren’t effected aren’t empathetic enough care That's absolutely false, feds power need cases national emergencies. ship people concentration camps based shape eyes, require cover mouth Walmart. trump rallies covid buffets point, state runs issue really deserve consequences. We're already almost full year this.  third wave genius r/movies today reminded Parasite best picture year. swear felt like years ago. Lots oral hygiene lately, hygiene....nope. would take serious looking into. Try googling ""academic paper"" it.  state requires mask many places, many failed follow, authorities don’t enforce, sure Joe make difference mask (assume wins) hear hospital systems efficient stacking covid patients distributing evenly among member hospitals none hospitals would overwhelmed covid patients suddenly, time. good think take evidence arguing strawman entire time. wash boxes plastic wrappings soap water, leave things need immediately garage front porch several days. also wash fresh veg fruit, soap.

I've found like washed packages. lose greasy feel even aware started washing them. great reach fridge milk carton feel clean. know neurosurgeon (yes, brain surgeon) recently stated hoax. wife (also doctor) overheard telling neighbor recently ""I know people scared covid. scared God."" 🤦‍♀️ embarassed mind. Guess he's voting for. call time BC (before corona) really clusterfuck there. I'm el paso originally (if all) 20 something friends taking seriously. Also, 85 year old grandfather hosting social gatherings house, he's essentially given up. mayor scumbag pass mask mandate. People go bars way often already, worst ones town reopened ""restaurants"". I'm sad hometown. guess want pinpoint situation today reasonable, since transmission seem picking pace place it’s exactly time talk ”results” sense yet. Remember Australia used example like yours, weeks per capita deaths intresses factor ten? Remember Czech republic ”Covid over” block party around July 1st?

Winter peak transmission time coronaviruses least one ahead us shit around. Stay safe! 5 times look education level. bet average Korean high school student much knowledgeable science reading comprehension US high schooler. Makes much easier teach pandemic.

Sure Korean education system extremely stressful, bright side people scientifically illiterate might little late?! people think hoax wear masks continue life normal. pay attention get badly sick someone know dies, suddenly believe real. Choppy take non-reply admission idea talking about? SLOW TESTING hahahahhahahahahahhahaha aint getting til 2025 Good therapists tell think. guide self-discovery. they? FLU CASES??????????????????????? read cdc.gov seasonly flu kind coronavirus current tests detect normal flu well? Source? Indiana aint stupid Americans
 one ECB start printing cheques people

Show that. I'm already Tracer. Everyone lives, lives, everyone dies, dies. That's American way. thinking corner supposed go around 10 million mile radius. see steep mountain daily infections get steeper weather gets colder. “a pretty good job self-isolating”.

If actually self-isolated, saying ""pretty good job"". Plus, article says kickboxing training leaving New Zealand. find hard interpret exactly result was? deem masks effective not? it’s worth, would never 2 weeks - it’s close long enough. You’re looking closer 100 days assuming it’s done well robust contact tracing teams One imagines either: 1) spa vagina steam, 2) normal spa use vaginal steam. winning? winning? Pitted, pitted LOVE idea!! would work non compliance businesses Sweden somewhat similar restriction ""hutte"". Swedes supposed travel 2 hours away home, many weekend homes far away.

However I'm sure timing, remember right Swedish 2-hour rule implemented later Norwegian one. admire work ACLU, time minds. South Korea (for one) proven contact tracing works. like digital devices tracking us alreadyl pace US would adding half million new cases every day. That’s insane 

It’s hard believe people putting effort staying safe it’s spreading fast like saying taught kindergarten: what's right always popular, what's popular always right. Fauci said: ""None family going get plane, let alone ride taxi plane, show Thanksgiving."" went on...""After leg journey quarantine 14 days. something can't do, we're year."" (Not exact words, close enough.)

I flying year...or possibly next year, either. till Fauci says safe. really hard say ""I think first reply through"", stop replying can't admit wrong?

I'm Italian, I'm well aware done help. We've taken stupendous amounts debt since start pandemic, great part pay billions subsidies furloughed workers (including myself) unemployed. 

But financial limit much debt take on, dictated ability sustain it, already compromised decades economic mismanagement led high debt load low economic growth.

Calling ECB start printing cheques people political fantasy. ECB limited mandate, mandate changed time soon. They're already making sure debt yields get control, massive boon give us room breathe, rest actual political action. mommy central bank save us, us faint hope unified European response. happen still see millions people die month. many cases Australia week again? Yup, think media done poor job narrative. Congrats. got 50% test Europe got 30%. Time celebrate. What's that, still got F like Europe? Could awful job?  Surely live standards expect others follow.

ROFL want Wall Street panic. That's downplayed risk China let people heavily infected cruises: trying protect Dow Jones boost ending trade war China. ongoing downplaying virus, rallies, mockery wearing mask shows care many people die it. Making anecdotes people shot coughing distract reality. Yo dawg heard like second waves put second wave second wave wave wave.  funny, virus showing us country regions deep problems societies. society really full nothing stupid, ignorant, selfish people? idiots protesting they're told stay safe lock down? fly plane sleeping gas, problem solved. seriousness, world showing people's backs feel wall, primitive drives fire ugly heads. fights toilet paper (Aus) rest world gave us sh\*t (panic buying) look rest world. issues toilet paper I'm pretty good country.

People like sheep. They'll everyone else doing. takes one small group complain people quickly jump board. 

Every person crowd selfish reason. going increase risk virus getting worse, guess means. Even tougher restrictions, even worse protests. forth. virus wins. woooooosh I've worried dying virus since February, dude. biggest things truly scare still day are:

1. mom, much older, *can* die it.

2. side effects virus really crazy (long-lasting lung problems, loss taste, cognitive issues) reports people even since January.

3. work can't exactly miss debilitating disease.

4. Speaking work... hell would able pay treatment thing? ever get States, I'll stuck home without ventilator hoping I'm one unlucky ones.

You want talk falling death rates? Sure, death rates falling, numbers high 83k cases single day, 1% death rates still 830 fucking people. 2% 1.66k. Falling death rates meaningless face large numbers insidious issues.

This nobody gives shit falling death rates. people I've ever seen truly like talking Republicans. idea why. Trump right along:

“Mr. president I’m sick tired winning” award new coronavirus record every day. Statistically, given healthcare head states receive, there's need head states infected one dies, 2000 countries earth.

This news actually means Poland fucked, right-wing facists (literally case) anything common, recovery harden commitment death cult. Churches packed... would imagine good bit people refusing wear masks, people gathering larger groups services offered, holiday gathering, near zero held accountability poor decisions placing others risk, children young adults circulating illness others school must resume, etc.

You know dumbest possible shit could done pandemic allow endlessly fester done. Surprise. remember NY navy ship, turned stadiums hospitals, also built makeshift ones? Oh, remember even need them? provide beds. Covid around less year we've seen long-term effects it. seen vaccine, any. risk getting vaccine far lower risk catching virus. Oh no, another protest? politics cared about. schools get fiber internet least. many teachers use chalkboards write emails. Vermonter, thank discouraging her. We're small outbreaks over. Worked nowhere world. Incredible India! Soon Infectious India. Every day new record. predict tomorrow “biggest one-day increase record”  test, find. countries testing like are. Ignorance bliss. None dictators, in-fact democratically elected, worship ""freedom"" religiously.

This like democracy's playbook. Latest review place work: hotel, new, nice, clean harass wearing mask.

Wonderful...  -_- even worse, Massachusetts haha think states Europe purchasing vaccines millions approved EU guaranteeing pharma companies backed case legal problems something forecast necessity? takes long time get 80% infected without collapsing health system. Even worst hit places significant antibody percentage.
Its even clear long natural resistance lasts. did. people given shit avoid point explain rest society pay big price irresponsability. ok, keep hipocrisy sleep well. fact many Americans dependent wealthy people generous something would offered free governments developed country frankly sad. parents put list Covid CL vaccine went flu jabs couple weeks ago, doctors said expected end November/early Dec risk people start getting it.

Not general public, billionaires etc either moderna pfizer vaccines use naked rna? Everything happened March 16th. schools VT closed year, daughter's college shut live-in client's day program suspended. surprised it. Help dear?

Getting Reddit Karma? California actually done well count cases population. Case per million 22,790, death per million 438, better US average 35M be. 50% population 25. Average age 29. Brazil US substantially older populations. I'm confused almost everywhere go nowadays requires mask. possible rising cases restaurants? mean social distancing means nothing confined space? Okay yes course that's means, I'm salty never understand people going restaurants time pandemic feeling like fucking idiot. I've inside restaurant twice since March, say matter would one 0 times. Many people know still eating multiple times month feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. don’t think know marginal means. 32k deaths 2018-2019 flu season. 225k deaths 8 months due COVID. factor 8 marginal definition. lying?

Here CDC’s excess death numbers try claim deaths aren’t due COVID fall propaganda designed gullible people. 

Scroll chart labeled Weekly number deaths (from Every POS thinking in-fact democratically elected.

The word thinking right-wing, conservative, fascist. Many doctors admit crying work, whether openly empathising patient behind closed doors. Common reasons crying compassion dying patient, identifying patient’s situation, feeling overwhelmed stress Crying rather frequent behavior among physicians, particular deal severe suffering patients  Interesting. knew Viruses like take information viruses (which unlikely, happens since semi-random jumps copy procedure), suggests Sars-1 around 17 years humans picked neuropilin-1protein flu became Sars-CoV-2 basically. sound insane. Basically... going advance argument literally third option, burden proof show options considered burden proof actually person advancing argument prove true

OC advancing (and continuing) argument lockdowns necessitate worse hardship letting pandemic rage, *nothing done* compensate victims lockdowns. absurd. 

I given examples things could done finance stimulus, predicted, hand waved away facile arguments. point create all-encompassing list alternatives, merely show trivial brainstorm alternatives.

But guess right. Italy simply fucked. simply solutions. doomed societal collapse either lockdowns uncontrolled pandemic. Good luck. /s Considering evidence vaccine ""not effective severe cases"", amount ""not antivaxxer"" gonna help you, start spewing conspiracies ""narrative vaccine"". likely used supply (developing) countries well, [Canada part international vaccine alliance

Also may require multiple doses boosters, sure yet. Nah I'm good. “natural”?? lol

OP mentions Italy specifically. sure fail understand I’m replying that. Funny don’t reply comparison Italy, maybe that’s good “natural”?

Scandinavian deaths/million last 30 days 

Norway &amp; Finland: 2 

Iceland: 3

Sweden: 6

Denmark: 9

Is better comparison? support contradict statement replying to? 
I’d like see Sweden double “second best” able say *Sweden lot worse*. 

Talking cumulative deaths halfway pandemic **not** age well anyway chose compare countries. COVID: I'll f*****g again! Yeah, every morning would go work check one countries news sites numbers new countries breakfast (they thread news since january 13h). point started checking reddit r/whoosh

Perhaps cryptic. point ***one person***. used FDA CDC NIH (because let’s forget conservative-troll mole sabotaging Fauci inside agency).

Now Fauci. Thank God. imagine we’d without him? 

We’re already FUBAR. What’s next level FUBAR? Still using shit tests, wonder . still using something work? someone making fortune it. Within chaos opportunity. FDA: *whatever lmao* people 70s lmao  good job containing things first hovered around dozen patients back spring. really losing handle things. growing world iron lungs shot question it. current president basically kicked responsibility governor's knew could end like figured political stunt shunt blame responsibilities. tight later out, me, going come happening. talk national response needed curtail get go. get here. sad hard deal find way it. Hopefully election helps but...I KNOW ANYMORR . incredibly disheartening Czech Republic go one poster childs pandemic worst hot spots world. early mask mandate helped brace pandemic better European countries ... pretended pandemic weeks screwed big time.

It's even ""herd immunity"" strategy. problem government wants keep schools businesses open costs. lockdown March left trauma. 

To make matters worst, coincided painful traumatic government formation following 2019 elections. people charge today charge maybe 3 weeks. that, temporary government limited powers constitutional kung fu address situation.

Moreover, late August/September cases started pick again, temporary government loosened lot public life. ""return normal life"" promulgated politicians conservative side.

Add byzantine governance, mixed messages ""accordion"" like management crisis: people fed up, tired, angry depressed. 2019 elections big boon extremist parties sides spectrum. So, little credit already left politics.

And so, belgian politics bind. Either enact stringent measures again, causing job loss shuttering businesses, people take care kids home, incur severe penalty next elections, keep public life open degree. tenable far health care concerned. insane? hasn’t even year it’s killed million people. average high-end deaths flu year half that. also immunity, treatment comparatively little information long term effects Covid. probably know happy little bubble consider maybe stupid. China 15k spike numbers allowed new rules define person Covid like spiral. Every time get back point worse before. funny think article written, US engaged actual cover-up, labs restricted testing, travel tested, test must sent Atlanta, Atlanta testing single digits day.

Turns out, back January, China country earth transparent. Well governor amazing first college session bars restaurants opened stopped trying. Grant it, people threatening life. don’t see us going another lockdown getting numbers control again. Perhaps struck politicians first, explanation stupid decision making. required... 👎
You could always move China/Russia North Korea like told time bad bad news. need get things control No. People know actual data survival rates make personal choices protect themselves. Let’s censor actual data. virus stable, changed time protein spike became efficient binding receptors. Wot Frankly, that's bad right-wing talking point. Countries would like nothing business usual, budgets getting bled dry, money getting taxes, one wants that. I'm talking need flatten curve hospitals areas getting overwhelmed again. country, they've started moving patients overwhelmed areas areas less impacted again, happened since June. get it, want globalism back. coming back. mainstream pivoted internationalism, likely permanently, God willing. politician wants ""hug Asian person"" Trudeau hundreds thousands dead virus never existed outside Asia. LOL. folks relishing saying things too. Like WHY? want fun shit again. loosened measures people acted like over. Pubs dining packed brim too. Many huge private indoor partys. matter time. made point someone Facebook using South Korea example aspire to. 300k+ excess deaths. Unfazed. 

Apparently, countries well ""have temporarily contained virus, still suffered economic consequences. cure vaccine, nations continue isolate themselves, eventually lead destitution."" Economically, yes, 15%-20% economy depends export, need nations buy stuff. Politically probably complicated. r/whoosh  Two waves stacked called Double Up, suck get stuck upside in. Chee Yes. I've panicking rising numbers since August, friends dismissed it. like, remember what's going, right?? go away shutdowns spring. 57 new case every hour 🙀🙀🙀 mean still make pessaries think. Something weird story. feels like episode show ""I Know Pregnant"" girl ends birthing quintuplets groundhogs day I’m American, didn’t already happen New York first wave? feels like Americans desensitized they’ll start caring it’s family member refused care. Little bit you’ll million week. *shelter old vulnerable, lazy Stonks go could wear mask, social distance required wash hands regularly wouldnt need shut kill people. 85,000!?

That's certainly good news, definitely need repeat Spring nightmare happened Europe US something dratic control, may late already

Man i've fought argument states. death expertise trying explain rates vs absolute numbers, exponential growth works, specificity sensitivity. I've given up. post reminder early months pandemic, lots specialists leaders US downplayed Covid. Moreover, much news cycle early February focused flu deadly, convincing American public Covid serious threat. 

During period, east Asian nations gearing mass testing expanded mask production.

Simple reminder: forget. Trump blame much failed response, blame also fall others well. everything right high risk situation anyway. control still comment misleading Should, arbitrary reasons? No. Could? moment, yeah, pretty much. Drinking Flavor-Aid. Sigh. better tested, people feel confident taking cannot believe still, 9 months in, mask mandate setup yet.

Ita solution simple ""drink water"", enough citizens would claim forced drink water equitable water boarded. could led Africa asia. worked emea multinational 'a' often north Africa fairly connected Europe. dont agree this, I'm pretty sure people realize wont done vaccine, wearing masks wont change thing ends. PA, 3 month lockdown could get ticket driving without driving somewhere ""essential"", still hundreds cases day end it. Ladies gentlemen, is: dumbest comment Reddit I’ve seen week. Thank u/two_rays_of_sunshine gloriously stupid contribution comment section. care you. We'll fine without mask, worried, stay home. happen get it, good, one less liberal crying touching kids plus book. impeachment vote house was, “trial”‘in senate year. Whoa everyone, we've got licensed engineer here! He's automatically qualified hold forth fields study, matter little knows them! Mate, can't even correctly theorize Type II error rates, accusing pseudo-intellectualism? Trump done good job. wars, money good right now, kids cages border little worrisome Obama one started much Donnie it. Trump also least racist president we’ve ever ever asymptomatic infect others exhaling close proximity them. mentioned mere breathing earlier comment means transmit virus.

And even already infected recovered others way know this. think way? absolutely do. post reminder early months pandemic, lots specialists leaders US downplayed Covid. Moreover, much news cycle early February focused flu deadly, convincing American public Covid serious threat. 

During period, east Asian nations gearing mass testing expanded mask production.

Simple reminder: forget. Trump blame much failed response, blame also fall others well.  actually idea you’re talking Many people speculated need booster shots virus. 3. Year date fewer deaths normal. 

Sorry mate. correct. are... Pretty sad trump kind influence staff, anyone make statement knowing many people died states!

Edit February 😂 live suburb TX everyone stopped wearing masks. Im frustrated it. Grown ass people acting entitled, selfish, ignorant. Grocery store last night, 10 people masks. Boy's soccer game. Im adult wearing mask. almost want take photos, get hit hard like, ""geez looking pictures, wonder happened?!?!""  Someone tried steal bike patio, probably within three four days lockdown starting nationally. cop driving unmarked vehicle, ended chasing couple them, re-converged house got bike back me. must’ve eight nine officers circling around, none masks on. Come door talk me, standing talking threshold door. 

They don’t give shit, they’re Trump bootlickers. They’re definitely gonna crack people wearing masks public, especially rural highly conservative areas. Ah okay, mean countries Turkic languages. That's bit different saying country Turkish, unless pan-Turkist zealot. live Baton Rouge, LA. much urban community. definitely fair share idiots too. say though MUCH worse surrounding suburban rural areas. 

Here city always see sneak stores run quickly corrected, people wearing chin straps, leaving nose out. see lot places workers chatting without on, put approach window store (wearing mask). I'm glad put talk me, still spreading other, like salon Georgia Alabama wherever was. 

In areas around city, care ALL. Many places even attempt follow mandate. Hhmm, maybe even try. think kind thing wont know sure make mandate. Stupid careless people need held responsible law. Deaths lagging indicator. we're midst spike cases, expect see deaths rise another several weeks. aged like milk Arizona sun can't make people care others. lack unity tackle problem. February. click see image full size. thumbnail, looks like strangely dressed man full beard. Masks mandatory live cases keep going up. People pretty much stopped social distancing since mask mandate. agree Germany handled pandemic best possible way far. I’m saying probably issues keeping spread restrictions fatigued people get. desperately want believe satire... Literal preachers TV tell cure COVID screen. charlatans wear Louis Vuitton shirts, claim God gave private jet riding commercial “demons” (their followers) distracting. 

As non-American, sometimes comes USA literally seems like dystopian Atwood fiction. people don’t get you? isn’t going stop. new common flu. can’t rush trials like this. Maybe stroke unrelated, maybe wasn’t. I’m lining take vaccine right away. no, crazy anti vaccination person. miss proper strains flu time mutated already I’ve reading. long ride.  Unbelievable  February. Downvote move on. control us, sheep letting control us.

They say zero irony too. came conclusion using critical thinking rather regurgitating BS hear media bubble Fox, OAN, talk radio. People wearing masks though.. definitely arent vast majority wear required business. Mandating anything slippery slope. 9 months old..... guys thirty doctorates nah I’ll go trump /s This, could partnered big TV/Movie production company popular YouTube content creators produce lessons engaging could distributed via public access tv channels already developed mass video sharing/streaming services. Teachers could utilized one one small group support assessment via phone video conference. also makes easier families without someone home support lessons different times day.

Instead chose try force square peg round hole.  feel like needs evidence supporting it. I'm skeptical couples friends dinner parties together significant driver, especially restaurants bars busy are. terrorized mans check you. Admit it. test like 10 bucks china Covid fatigue can't breathe anymore fluid lungs overpowering muscles, get put ventilator, 36% people survive.

Excuse found, problem solved. Let's face truth. America, done! schools traced person getting outside school bringing in. masks aren’t 100% everyone wearing one effective. Well European report fiber availability recently. France 65%, Germany 3%. tells everything know infrastructure.  Bevis Butthead dirty comparisons cares! long one mandates wear mask (sarc) think Nordic countries reporting incorrectly? that's way SENATE structured, ffs. House goes population. is/was common pre-Covid Idaho point people insurance riders paying medical flights. rural areas throughout US, hospital density staff specialists financial support certification e.g. level 1 trauma exist. Yeah. Get rid cars. Go back horses! happened March. can't wish harm someone caused immense harm millions people? Go away, dumb dumb. Yep, also see peak deaths respective age groups. older age group, later peak occurs (based data first wave US, suppose it‘s true general). This, well general lag infections deaths, make outbreak initially look less severe actually is. False. user changed one bit. get lulled trolls like these. eventually able live fun normal life early 2021 almost 1 year ago. 

(Unless user, course.) Yes, reasonable response 

The state motto literally live free die big “freedom rally” MT weeks ago nobody wore masks, despite mandate. there’s covid cases tracing back event. department health tried issue fines, sheriffs office refused cooperate. Nothing anyone even law enforcement won’t uphold law.  Sitting pretty Australia state total 10 comunity transmitted cases. even one iota lockdown quarantine whole time. 
Feels fucking good man. talking New York, staffers visitors caused infections deaths nursing homes, recovering COVID-19 patients sent back there. timeline wrong returning patients ones spreading nursing homes. Despite that, risk.

This cautionary tale: try get infections hospitalizations control going forced make tough potentially dangerous choices. Cuomo sent recovering nursing home residents back nursing homes desperation free ICU beds new Coronovirus patients. quite possible actually saved lives order. read original comment, police speeding patrolling. said, yes, responding call, perfectly like said surgeon. read two_rays_of_sunshine comment responding call. Absolutely agree. son score 95+ Junior year Westwood High Austin. says actually fine online education. However kids failing grades quite lot them. think 70% kids failing grades Austin.

So would say pretty much specific kid used learn. taught learn since 5th grade shows now. kids might need permanent adult supervision school actually learn. trying write 750 thousand American deaths? Fucking asshole Mask mandates reintroduced September 1 Czechia, almost two months record peak see now. Maybe take ass feel like got phrased Death deer down. 

All kidding aside; thanks reading wrote open idea I’m right wing troll like things around here. Getting sick dying different, we’re serious overachievers. Source required. need source claim, statistics straightforward. Nebraska specifically Omaha, wear mask business $500 fine you, also additional $500 fine business serve employee served you. Even explaining people denying services, still wear masks. ones really want shit want wear one throw little temper tantrum throw one on, wear mask nose. I've also yet see hear anybody actually fined question actually enforced all. dont work America. ""Lawful, human-rights based interventions"" resulted catasthrope taken 1 million lives mostly vulnerable people. time relativize ""individual freedom"" name people's lifes. second mandated basically everyone started half assing legal issue, moral one.

It's law piss public still feel get away it.Laws optional. Feeling like bad person (usually). People jaywalk litter sorts shit they're supposed law.

I want everyone wear damn things unless there's cop around feel bad around chin, reality moral imperative strong protect fellow people suffering overt risk.

It's really painful observe I've basically giving opinion. agree assessment, lots essential workers working face face lockdown beyond, probably exposed low viral loads got infected. cool study subject apologize asked before. vaccine work, people able get Corona once?  [Apparently South I've saying personal life events years, there's pretty universal experience. really living history. worrisome. trajectory on, second lockdown imminent, it’ll Inauguration Day either way. Hospitalizations already spiking sharply. we’re witnessing huge surge cases. health care system gets overwhelmed.  ""we mandate"" must agree politicized improve much point. instead get scenario:

""You need wear masks.""   
""No!""   
*Cases start sky-rocket*   
""Look, really, wear mask, things getting worse.""   
""No!""   
*Hospitalizations start sky-rocket*   
""People dying, everybody wear mask!""

Sorry, hivemind doesnt listen smart people. parts US.

I've snow yard now. people march banner tolerance acceptance atop pedestal high, immediately resort calling people ""retards"" drop hat? guess missed basic education common sense, you’re 9 months pandemic still don’t understand masks protect mouth breathers infecting others know they’ve got virus don’t know tell you. It’s like condom, also isn’t 100% effective, it’s preventative. masks. Think societies allowing euthanasia least, taking ""let burn **fast**"" approach knowing turning away care? saying again? United stand, divided fall?

How Earth wearing masks become political issue? purely public health issue! even customize masks display Trump 2020 whatever want!

Sorry, I'm frustrated Canadian insane neighbors acting. rate border stay closed years. random lol Meanwhile here's latest charts Idaho, running 7-day beginning track spike cases. Idaho currently 31.93 deaths per 100k true sars-cov2 coronavirus coronaviruses this. opposite effect Much 'greater' Belgium, 491,000 equivalent US cases today, 17,568 cases, insanity think blanket statement nuanced. days chasing imported cases done quickly resources overwhelmed spread accelerated. case load decreased become possible again. sure extent contact tracing done now.

We’ve total 2 restaurants since early March ate outdoors. Last night, decided try comedy show (albeit indoors) rules were: masks, distanced tables. Nobody wore masks, asshole behind coughing didn’t even decency cover mouth. coughing air. I’m going back anymore simply lost faith people. sure correct. mutate rapidly flu different strains little variability, making vaccine seem effective. 

Of course mean virus instantly eradicated. Look things like Measles Polio perfect vaccine yet can't get everyone actually take it. Nah, we've come winter. word mean think means. south italy\* Lmao. always custody!!!! America number 1! Even number right, that's ~1.3mn deaths US assuming hospitals get overrun.

Pray tell, measures taking keep hospitals run? ""Rounding corner"" soon 2 days ago Deaths going too. Here's latest list states ranked 7-day per capita Help here, world think opening country proper response even restrictions quarantines 230,000 deaths 70K+ new infections every day? Thanks heads content, maturity. 

At 40 I'm Crossroads regarding tensions fully growing keeping things bit easy, decided yet forget small,-large company events. potlucks banquet Could convey thought better that. Protesting terrorism? understand they're protesting...right? summer it? Next week, unless states start cutting back reporting Florida claimed start soon. think late. politicized attempt national mandate fail without massive fines punishment, attempt week met pushback lawsuits tied courts. 

It's late ship sailed IMO. think attempt made. lol overthinking statement Fuckin Trump I’m hoping they’re least like 15 something can’t vote, lol. emotionally challenging sure. sleepless nights, remember thinking, either weird blip life, road second child. 

Nothing certain fostering, definitely kids free adopt use home. babies. That's first wave hit elderly, yet protecting themselves. Now, many nursing homes. course death rate lower.

That mean deaths. Or, importantly, people long-term health consequences. Many people 30-50 range reported this. Less developer countries probably severely under-reporting. Dude seriously. Look sub...its nothing ahhhhhhh dying....then post article needing get kids back school...which agree with....but ones sub (yes know thats exaggeration still) think way....I putting post ..I using try show doom gloooomers hiding bunkers seriously bad results well ...  feel like I'm sacrificing everything everyone important life go party. whole family lives another country can't reliably get back, asshole ""friends"" open mic nights H&amp;M sell fucking glitter socks whatever hell everyone deems important.

Biologist friend mine access genome first days made available widely researchers, mention genetic markers indicate SARS SARSCov2 close. many per capita US? /s ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ) Trump: ""It's going away"" functional alternatives mask?

Staying home.

That's basically it. 

As aside, anti-maskers conservative, would accept argument anything else. places masks mandated, follow law simply like (or make arguments ""it's order, law,"" nonsense legal perspective. liberal argues stop arresting people smoking pot, people scream ""IT'S LAW."" places masks mandated, businesses require them, people argue businesses cannot deny service refusal. However, also argue businesses allowed refuse service gay people. even still argue businesses allowed refuse service people color.

These people cannot reasoned with. right mask mandate work, people care understand actions affect others. try make us feel bad criticizing killing people due choices.

To reiterate: functional alternative masks staying home. 1.1m tests... compared actual prak NY % positive 24%. bow barely 5-6%... yup, ty. live Des Moines still mandated go work. every day, still, needless easily work home. people charge old-school think one work home without productivity falling (or they're micromanagement lovers, can't stand seeing employees ensure fact working).

Iowa terribly ran governed ultimately fault many people take seriously. light end tunnel around corner, could almost see light fucking dark here. Yes, thank you! totally absurd - morally repugnant - midst deadliest pandemic century ECB allowed euro area go deflation 

We need 5% inflation two years need achieve broad dissemination hardest hit persons instead continuing asset buying serves decouple stock market real economy. Mostly correct. second wave, however, flooded south. makes sense, summer hot everyone goes inside air conditioning.

In winter, people across country go inside heat (except states...like Florida). midwest started third wave first, spreading weather changes.  I'm sorry :( I'm lucky wife boat.

To fair, may less coverage honestly think going dominate news cycles get vaccine. daily staple npr since started.

All try keep two safe even think makes sense so. Italy, still 12% positive rate regions 40%+ Indeed, mentioned article, tests started reliable tests developed. running six months since start pandemic essentially nine months ago western world  Even worse counties they’re sending patients Seattle Portland. Blue “anarchist” cities taking precautions ""nobody knew"" Also like literally thousands thousands foreigners living China access western social media.

Anyone believes China could silence anything close even tenth size Wuhan level outbreak idiots. Test, trace, isolate Fauci losing credibility here. Masks mandate shit. Nobody enforces them. need shutdown strict longer difficult reasoned conversations covid response people understand even less modern economies work viruses work.

There's another one brewing. Uyghur death camps. multiple studies showing T-cell response robust proves immunity usually guaranteed rare reinfections happen happen viruses example get flu strain twice. Furthermore, little reinfections literally statistical anomaly. None increases look particularly sharp, except Midwest. also find charts particularly useful, they're total counts rather per 100k show trendlines percentage change week week seven day period. difficult get useful information them, = bad.

The Washington Post story alarming compelling, instances systems danger overwhelmed anecdotes isolated specific subregions. seems bit inconsistent bucket third geographic area CONUS ""Midwest,"" get alarmed supposed potential hospitals overwhelmed citing anecdote one region Utah. I'm certain bucketed ICU capacity utilization similarly, data appear alarming.

If want useful information Washington Post, I'd suggest using [this page charts rather stories. last table one hospitalizations state, including week week percentage change. Even little difficult use assess threat, utilization included data point.

[My state's much useful, shows utilization also makes data available download slice chart ways may find useful. plateaued new cases two months ago, deaths continued drop even month phase three, hospitalizations ventilations stable several weeks. also track data bucketed region within state, also census tract. clear divergence performance across areas.

Looking national regional numbers alarmed announcing we're primed ""rapid overwhelming spread everywhere"" irresponsible.

I'm pretty sure know fair bit China since study economic political system. like first wave still rippling country. went big cities, secondary big cities, rural areas. cities hit first experiencing second wave probably ripple pattern. biggest one-day increase *so far* Oh headline again, that’s what? 71st? ticket moving car often?  tested flu negative. sure exactly was, told us upper respiratory infection.

I'd worried Trump tbh even 1970s. born height we’re gonna die mass environmental degradation hysteria. It’s big part gen-x split two cohorts really majority generation born right boomers much smaller part born mid70s generation end. Even husband (both firmly genXers, experiences number people age different mine brothers born 5-7 years later). sister millennial post 1980 birth led experience quite different brother I. know pretty robust immunity lasting several months. obivousy know exactly long yet assume normal distribution still tail (i.e. infected spring reinfected 6 months later). Good. Dumb question. write 200,000.000 know 200,000,000? Idk else tell there’s evidence China lying. evidence, like hospitals cities filling up, US govt media would screech nonstop. course measures would viable, it’s governments don’t want them. Illinois. Suburbs Chicago anyways. It’s normal see everyone mask see anyone without. don’t know bothers more. take stand don’t wear wear stupid fucking chin strap upside sun visors masks.  deductible met October probably be. Belgium? Yep. feel like idiot knowing used trust wholeheartedly. No, act like they're one depressed make absolutely attempt anything except add problem dont disagree that. point originally said commenter shouldnt put stat makes seem less deadly. think stats left out. People able get info make decision afraid be. think people dont feel manipulated likely follow mandates even arnt afraid covid. one Idaho County w/out mask mandate able receive treatment Oregon. Deal consequences choices  last page article. Appears 90% people antibodies stick around. Maybe didn’t amount good enough immune response first time they’re part remaining 10%...

 .... found 90%  previous SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive subjects (198/221), healthcare workers potential plasma donors, carry antibodies, 75% medium high titres  addition, found subjects detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralisation activity  accordance  determined IgG titre level.  agreement recent report [16]. strong correlation RBD IgG titres neutralising activity well protective immunity [16, 31], suggests people infected SARS-CoV-2 circulating protective immunity many months COVID-19. addition, recent reports cell responsiveness [32-35] show robust cell response. Since SARS-CoV-2 response line well-known detailed studied immune responses resulting  lymphocyte memory,   likely  SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity, reducing disease severity, last least years. rounding wrong turn... Yep, mostly lazy parents can’t deal kids home.

/yes, know need work outside home need day care


//the moms group likely don’t fall category Global 97-99% recovery rate. Let's get real folks, getting fucking ridiculous now. surprising. He's actually taken basic precautions avoid virus. would believe single thing Trump told unless/until actually happens. He's proven long ago he's reliable source. I'm sensing sarcasm. think others though.  Mine isn’t. announced they’re virtual spring 2021. Anecdotal still  populace respond"" simply within powers someone simply trained public health.

That literally public health IS. 


if virologist epidemologist trained public health! Public health \*behavior\*! Slovakia? look things? thought. Let’s forget people everything right, didn’t catch covid, won’t able get critical care strokes, heart attacks, cancer, etc. people insisted “rights” take zero precautions midst pandemic. know right? honestly seen 1 person months public except without masks. except outrage photos news Reddit... really think trade credibility wasn’t worth it. 

He lied can’t undone giving reason. 

Now need people wear masks ALWAYS people refuse listen particular set advice always point this. 

I understand reason worth IMO. long haul losing trust far damaging long run.  Sorry dumb question, know Sturgis, right? make 80% americans that's true.

The average tax bill 4000 dollars canada.

Which less average american. entirely true. heard ""don't get tested quarantine must"" one coworkers two kids (they're Midwest). 20% herd immunity stat bandied ever since Atlantic published article it. It’s purely theoretical, iirc, doesn’t even assume vaccine. Trump said would mobilize military give vaccine, considering everything he's said, can't know sure another one lies. /s/adapt to/ignore

at least 50% population. flu

You realize flu average kills 40,000 people US year. We're nearing 6 times number deaths COVID predicted continue getting worse. saw three people didn’t wear masks store requires masks day, roommate like cough crazy around get away us Re-reading comment made realise 850 000 inhabitants South Dakota, 1132 **per 100 000** last two weeks roughly 10 000. seems fair active’ish. 

That’s lot. Like really lot. Czech Republic levels. That’s awesome! wonder we’ll see cheaper tests Christmas gets closer. Would nice test parents siblings make sure people negative hang out. there's Walmart. understand ""ratio"" 1 100%... right? 💕 experts saying that. say US week three behind Europe. Jeez trying hard think private tests available used China? Tons people everywhere bought test convenience free testing available. Sweden didn’t ignore virus. Claiming discredits you’re trying prove.  true. read population bomb 1970s. made similar arguments make now. people castigating parents kids. imply situation never happened incorrect. Hey, leave us roleplayers this! evidence higher fatality rate good evidence greater infectiousness However stats typically get left actually make seem less dangerous. Excess death numbers excluded. total number deaths JHU omits 100's 1000's deaths release CDC considers attributable covid. I'm saying shut-down. we're talking it, found numerous articles net stating Iowa never shut down, clueless what's going on. thankful say. saying is, can't link single source stating shut down? also live Iowa. never shut state. one state, feel free link health department page stating so. Also read title news article? Never shut struggling anyway. Lol proving point. saw drunk rambling hobo street yesterday. clearly sleeping streets quite while, hair unkept pants soiled. 

He still facemask. NYC's infection rate okay. Btw native english speaker thats bad. think german better programmed developers eh mean real human experience real human life interactions real humans. try improve think yeah really improve guess... hd eh brain old... think recognize observed sceptic subs also made many snarky offensive comments sub. say would catogorize earlier experiences - good, civil, fun interaction.  18 months call, one wanted believe it. ???.... 500,000 people, wearing masks, meeting huge numbers bars, restaurants, motels hotels, middle Pandemic, 'debunked'... fact, look Dictionary next phase ""Natural Selection"" there's picture Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.... Difference US stays number months might looking cumulative numbers. thought America continent country  will. Biden going push people wear masks, follow science mandate masks every (All Federally funded transportation good place start). Biden bring magically cure, following science getting everyone else get spread rate lot. nothing ignoring science let virus spread like wildfire getting many people wear masks slow virus spread lot. Masks might magical underwear reduce risk significantly. agree, theater...  Well whole law law enforcement field makes money hand fist kinds arrests, maybe it’s money thing? mean many countries manage support people pandemic. Germany offers financial help companys send people called short work greatly reduce hours (in cases zero) still get paid around 70% average salary. Which, ideal, still worlds ahead whatever fuck US 1200$ one time check. Policies help done correctly. think guy meant public health crisis India: 224,000,000 day 16% Yet ANOTHER new high 

I'm done Sheriff Orlando florida straight said would fire employees wearing masks... bunch idiots imo

edit: spelling winter going one history books. They’ll talk 100 years now.

I hope start gradually putting end January. think funny people can't afford 4k year insurance pay least 7-8k taxes go healthcare Canada. would cheaper usa lol. No. I'm saying shut-down. we're talking it, found numerous articles net stating Iowa never shut down, clueless what's going on. thankful say.  think countries outside four? New Zealand Taiwan small island countries fraction population seen countries like US Western Europe. China exactly trustworthy eyes, draconian measures took crush virus would viable Western democracies.

How 2 weeks flatten curve turn “no cases allowed all”? can’t math I’m going attempt come way.

I headline though, yes, active cases usually means sounds like. don’t know that’s error here. September 2020 least deadly month relative previous years many countries, Finland Norway included. idea news. What's interesting see doing?

Have seen Sweden's curve October? mention degree alcoholism Russia made adopting Russia extremely risky back option. corn industry better lobbyists small business. completely agree...just saying implemented things, think little, late. #1 thing close indoor dining. Bars already closed, start. Still convinced closing schools due real online platform place. Businesses still forcing folks come in, even though telework encouraged, packing transit restaurants lunch (subsidized meals work week). Fuck michigan. 

&amp;#x200B;

O H Haha original Cal Ripken pandemics   I'm cool. I'm also mad hell I'm going take more. majority cases asymptomatic, need look death rate. right Italy even close last spring. think people going pretty shocked long takes deliver vaccine, many people keep getting covid dying approved. Mask wearing need save lives. Another record? Trump right, tired winning. least O'Reilly TV, laser nonsense. Hannity picks script like lackey is. outbreaks I've seen lately schools employers everyone wearing masks. Well repeatedly told Trump nothing plan. Yet 10% deaths high estimates. countries Europe almost Covid-free month ago getting decimated positivity rates roof. country second lockdown now. seems easy keep virus bay summer. temperatures dropping, measures far proven largely ineffective. It’s proven reddest states governor simply issuing mandate makes mask usage increase dramatically. Alabama, Mississippi, Indiana, Utah, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Texas saw effect. answer obvious questions: Yes, always people refuse matter what, yes, places accepting SF NYC. people aren’t morons screaming “mAsKs MaKe bReAtHe cO2 dIe!!” make news. apparently likely work given early on. seems similar Remesdivir (which totally different treatment). Earth test treatments likely work early on? 👍🏼 Death rate measured infected population. can't calculate like this. I'm generally abortions too, clearly none fucking business want get one. Wfh one best interventions do. lawyer practiced med mal defense, arrogance like kind displaying bad fucking news. Pretty sure Eurasia EMEA hit 250k Europe. mean, ""region"" really arbitrary concept. Put list, beautiful part world you’re cultured. 
Nice chatting Poland, Czechia first wave. hospitals full starting. think stepped twilight dimension. think immunity works still become contagious?

Unless mean hands, sure - wash hands savages. It’s crazy seeing people educated topic completely fail bare minimum. hope. Winter.Thanksgiving.Black Friday.Christmas. even yet.

This going terrible time coming winter America. dumb take risk recreation, especially kill like BASE jumping similar adventure sports. 

Take risk pandemic shop food: good. Risk shared pie hole stuffing? Lol.

The question one ask would fuck dinner guests without condom? don’t pandemic! nation unlucky infection worse. imagine Coronavirus solved Trump problem us. Someone forgot wear mask...

Sorry, make bad jokes. Thank hard work. imagine frustrating would hear ignorant people refuse take seriously.

I'm keep family healthy safe. I'm royalty ticked anti-maskers.

I hope loved ones stay healthy safe! Idk. see eyes? people wearing masks not? personally seen anyone wearing mask lately. opposed earlier year one numbers went down. No, don’t care enough Lord Rings.

One day maybe them. Victoria done exceptionally well using authoritarian policies. vaccine. two trials going slowed data contamination. months away best case estimates getting vaccine.

Mask up. 
Wash hands.
Sanitize commonly touched surfaces. Cover mouth cough sneeze.
Monitor health daily thermometer.
Maintain social distance six feet more.

Work home canvwork ho.me.

Limit social contact. 
Avoid high density activities like grocery shopping, restaurants, schools churches. 

Get flu shot now.

If little extra money please consider donating food bank. one local area told every dollar receive turns meal six people.

Things rough next months.

It dark winter. Wuhan like 89,000 started seeing videos people getting boarded up. Total cases, though. get single day, yet idiot president talks opening asap.  Smh WE’RE NUMBER 1! WE’RE NUMBER 1! num...oh god Let’s bother then, instead let’s run round licking other’s faces. Don’t forget ability print world reserve currency. 

Truly failed state Everybody remembers first encountered word dilation. mean, many March, didn’t enough tests. It’s bad thing sure, comparisons case numbers time don’t mean much. 83,000 ONE DAY? Hooooly cow.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There’s definitely middle ground won’t found thread. It’s total lockdown anti capitalist; question labeled unreasonable enemy humanity. NZ? Yep. find interesting compared Netherlands, curve seems delayed amount time academic year starts later schools NL. grew Europe moved US adult. cultured now? First, gave indication tested positive previous comment, one, first sentence remains useless. Also test would show remained.

Second, think know virus works, whole contagious part. Unless meant hands such, case... heard washing hands? wiping items?

I continue stay mostly home, social distance, use mask, said far seems based fear anything else. 50% cut IFR death rate cancelled 100% rise cases, crude terms. matter much we've made Covid 1/10 deadly (which would huge laudable achievement medical community btw) 10x many infected.

Also death rate/IFR case number managed people different occupations. former belongs medical category, latter socio-political.

And...I mean hate idea even needs pointed out...but, modern civilised society, ""not getting killed"" really low bar standard life. don’t get downvotes it’s legitimate question. Even don’t catch covid heal without much complication, people gonna know screwed go ER reason wait 9 hours get treatment(a friend’s experience - June!) ""encourage others get sick die"" - one that. problem Trump GOP, doubled virus fake, disappear, GOP foot soldiers either knowingly unknowingly keep repeating message.

Unfortunately cost American lives. Right mid-west worst COVID19 outbreak counted per million people.

[Canadian news source: Dynamic Graph COVID19 cases US Economy tanking ppl buy less stupid crap need. vaccine end yr fairy tale. Sometimes politicians cannot force medicine like so-called opioid crisis, sometimes medical issues say 'Fuck you' like. literally already. lijebduring presidential debates prediction 1-2 million deaths, he's taking credit number that. Utterly ignoring fact deaths lower despite him, rather him.

Just like claims he's best president black community since Lincoln; rode Obama's coattails 3 years managed screw everything up. contradicted told look comment doom gloom comments told you’re sarcastic. Einstein? *Stosslüften* - fling everything wide open really let blow through, bracing fresh air.  
  
We also open doors early mornings switch air whole house. cultured ones hoarded lead underwear now, late. Everyone failing fuck it, let’s even try since impossible. 🤦‍♀️ What's unfortunate part? Although common knowledge antibodies product immune system fight virus, it’s heartening see 90% groups test (per article) zero positive **after six months**. question groups antibodies routinely exposed virus, healthcare workers. It’s becoming increasingly clear lasting immunity Effect majority people. $$$ no, understanding. comparing detected cases, saying do. Reality is, hospitalization death numbers going far fast. Unless something dratic control, may late already Spanish economy based waiting nursing English German tourists retirees. tried [religious time around ;) internet allows people cluster communities people largely share agree world view. Since lot developing healthy sensible worldview interacting world refining beliefs challenged create bubble effect people hold really strange harmful beliefs. Yeah lets ignore Asian experiences order admit failure. yep. local schools going hybrid around here, coworkers happy kids. town ~10,000 fucking students grades K-12.

hearing coworkers say ""so glad over"" makes fucking mad. bought doom today shoot shit otherwise might murder covid Hey people losing shit... people try stop downvoting start wearing mask taking global pandemic seriously want likely happen: get control. economy toilet people getting sick go public large numbers guess what? don’t go public much. Get pandemic control economy, doesn’t work way around except fantasies. Dumb outnumber sane + democracy + greed = :( Norwegian, SAS Easter, remember? Peter Cottontail got tricks puff tail. Hmm, lots packed rallies, masks sight. subsequent increases infection. wonder connection? Thank lucky stars competent governor, rather pedophile-pardoning shit got voted out. can't believe Kentucky still leans republican republican governor pardon *multiple* child rapists. would suffered, sure. inevitable. business that's allowed operational suffer less one forced close. many people forget people behind businesses. lockdown might save grandma, might well kill grandchild sees business destroyed can't see sustainable future. modest recovery summer. Why? allowed country open domestic certain extent international tourism. people got subsidies, still waiting.

Now, everyone knows virus potential overwhelm hospitals, saw last spring. could argue 8 months enough prepare new wave need panic much beginning. Yet around world obvious invested enough money health services they're bringing back lockdowns. way NEVER world agreed pre-covid protocols concerning new potentially deadly pandemic. need violent ones. Make undeniably unstoppable.  Morons love simple answers complex problems don’t chance working reality. Lol wow. Snowflakes abound. Japanese cancelled emperors birthday spring. planning x-mas virtual event. Don’t worry it’ll gone April

It’s still March right? Selfish Americans travel New Zealand often lmao People still celebrate Christmas, might look different many people. article include Russia, ‘Europe’ likely mean everything Atlantic Urals. new infections figure combined population well 700 million. Yo dawg, heard liked waves... LoL federal govg plan set send 5 masks/household back February Trump killed it. also knowingly lied severity masks. detected cases far March April.

Still understanding this? can't compare detected cases March/April numbers. valid comparison massive increase testing capacity. numbers telling us close true number infections. numbers March/April fraction true number infections. reality European countries much better situation March/April true number infections deaths much lower, least. neighbors wear masks stores. also eat restaurants every week, small gatherings like 10 friends month so, kids friends almost every day. go church every Sunday. 
So yeah, people wearing masks also social distancing limiting contact. 
Masks aren’t infallible people congregating indoors. risk going up. like NASCAR? see stories coming already. think right thing obvious Christmas time. Cases rising lot area, Thanksgiving could change rates. We'll see. outbreak started, sister arrived china attend martial arts school she'd saving years go to. school crazy far Wuhan, remember clearly telling coworker worried already hundreds cases reported. Needless say, ruined trip pretty fast, still feels surreal even imagine numbers low all. mean avoid Swedes? They're anti-mask. avoid them, explain they're wrong change. save lives here. brush fires freedom still burning friend

Protest March Berlin August protest Berlin August 29th: London couple weeks one London month massive protest protest Slovak Hooligans protest coronavirus Naples, Italy anti lockdown rioters assault 22nd anti lockdown protests son struggling grades year remote learning it’s actually good know it’s kids struggling well. Honestly don’t care grades know he’s safe infection staying home. Restaurants open BY. worker hcs wont go, need reduce risk patients. Fortunately work Sweden let old die instead bringing hospital.

Enjoy meal. Yes, give us hope Dont ya like winning? Sorry, emphasis Australia NZ 
This don’t miss you. tool bag took turn locked down. keep self protected restaurant, take mask time eat.

The servers see protected, what's stop someone walking past (on street) coughing near eat?

What bathroom? going mask entire time? person stall next you?

These still, remain get around pandemic, haunt dining long time. mean, that's have, that's pretty weak both-sidesism, imo. Trump still calling covid ""the sniffles"" like last month downplayed entire pandemic. Many high profile Republicans publicly refused wear masks. People wearing masks silicon nitrate embedded fibers. protects family, don’t think they’d even much protect me. know they’ll also refuse keep immediate family. 20ish family members five states seems reckless me. dad one “I keep living life” kind people. sister still goes bars parties friends. pitted
r/sopitted Lol, believe babies? know babies placed people's homes government control spending habits get get vaccines? Big Baby fooling everyone I'll go experts, thanks type behavior exactly America Europe cannot control virus, meanwhile areas world socially responsible populations gotten mostly control. this? keep numbers low keep schools open? Yeah remember geography class, that’s Europe. could also look map. probably stop voting Republican, considering cut education funding consistently. 

Very little pity left point. Yeah am, online shopping delivery pickup always shows stock... miracle time get stuff refunded bec stock... 220,000 americans dead, 1/4th-1/5th world. 300 million people, world 7 billion people total.

If dont find number bad, living dream world.  What's point here? everyone diabetes deserves die go bars? America, Trader Joe's powerful President. problem encouraging wearing masks one note, foolish 340 million people US never monolith. several different marketing campaigns masks addressing different groups people: elderly, patriots, people service sector, etc. Belgian numbers 9% ends ICU (compared 21% first wave) death rate ICU remains stable 36%. change mortality rate ICU. 


We saw 585 submissions today hospital. title post accurate. still cover COVID19 diagnostics treatment, they're going start applying standard copay/coinsurance costs, prior end month waived. Whats turn around time results? Last looked May, turn around time still long. fixed issue might something look upcoming holidays. could every thing don’t authority threaten funding get states pass law complies. get free public testing many places private testing like covered insurance well. going impossible people think fake masks hoaxes. Stores restaurants need stop serving people. refuse, they're nice longer welcome arrested trespassing. husband someone try fight yesterday it. He’s tall, muscular man. now, lord help us holidays.  anything, likely promotes healthier patterns sexuality imho.

How much shadiness trying play (on level) games play someone like trump? would operated someone actually let thing? knows?

Hi UK. know feeling moment, recently too. blame you, Europe naivety. Germany Italy gone, there's hope us sadly. What?

Viruses brains, ""know"" anything. Even did, mutation conscious process.

Sure, viruses survive long-term eventually mutate infectious less deadly. lot viruses *don't* survive long-term, precisely wind mutating way. considering we're ten months pandemic, nowhere near ""long-term"" yet. know virus going die persist long term, because, again, ""long term"" happened yet.

You might want little reading survivorship bias. general idea ""never assume species something lot species encounter day-to-day life thing. definition, encountering extinct species day-to-day life, need count those, too, want know 'all species' do."" Get police make people wear masks defunding time. Yes requires people mildly inconvenienceing good others, never happen need pay rent/feed myself/pay bills/etc..... say established scientists? deforming words fit narrative now. said scientists clearly established COVID-19 spreads. I've already mentioned multiple times above, includes in-door areas, lack social distancing low mask compliance. Guess least 2 3 categories schools fit into? 

Right. yeah, I'm dismissing entire counter arguments clear bias. article quoted describes lack data flawed analysis. put higher quality article, I'm gonna continue skeptic findings. referring hand gestures US president uses every time speaks. Looks like he's playing invisible accordian. Yeah generally trust scientific process fuck would take rushed vaccine still wear masks social distance?

I would absolutely take rushed vaccine tomorrow meant could burn mask go concert. Mask usage slippery slope. telling people else sets precedent. Good. 

I concerned react like teenager.

Then watch video. might learn something stop spreading disinformation. especially help others understand whats happening, lied to. I'm sure age youre able come healthy conclusions. opinions fear-porn. Conclusions based data.

All best. wish lot courage ability discern fear love. easy manipulated fear death.

PS. you, would stop listening everything corporate massmedia trying convince people believe. would sick stressed did. Instead, care parents wellbeing, would research bat-shit every possible source information thats pandemic. would know much, much whats told reported TV govt. know why? History likes repeat know govts cannot trusted. suddenly think now, youre trouble. national police force something else Canadians better us. arguing cases increasing due testing spread, yet, admit positivity, hospitalizations, deaths up. result testing well? realize increasing testing lower positivity spread constant, right? surgens wear masks? Surgeons dont usuallg wear N95 surgeries. Ill answer question, surgeons protect OTHERS salivia bacteria. applies cloth masks vs surgeon masks. everyone protects OTHERS keeps transmission allows us reopen. ALSO get feeling litte hesitant current science. Remeber science absolute. ever moving evolving. covid better treatments cut deathrate way lessened need vents. understand wide symptoms also asymptomatic. Hense masks. thing transmissible asymptomatic would died china. issue needed masks sooner knew airborne transmitter even know it. panic decision like tp. still think so, would strongly suggest reevaluate get information. yeah graph convex Yep, what's thing really changed US europe since August. Schools open.

Turns increase slow, real. I’m Italy right here’s two cents-
Number one: like comment says below, schools main culprit. live directly across middle high school, watched window, literally day ONE kids taking masks within first hour school. Parents congregate outside gates, social distanced, half without masks bc guess they’re outside, waiting pick kids. second day school watched like 8 parents pass around baby chatting close together-all maskless. don’t necessarily blame kids much, they’re young immature. Parents hand know better. 

Second: Restaurants. feel like we’ve unseasonably cold /rainy weather around last 3-4 weeks? drives people inside. think it’s frustrating every time partner try get food to-go, struggle REAL. lot restaurants somehow still prepared takeout. don’t takeout, we’ve asked patio situation like. can’t tell many places told us aren’t putting tables outside it’s cold, regardless say we’re interested. Lately we’ve found places takeout, it’s really uncomfortable picking food there. Restaurants PACKED inside. outsiders perspective, think Italy struggles change culture regarding restaurants. Eating times rigid, lot places allow to-go like 30 mins open? It’s mess.

Third: think people got complacent it. can’t tell many noses see peeking out, many people get right next grab something grocery store. I’ve started getting home deliveries bc I’m uncomfortable store. Maybe? Sigh. we’re interested number one coronavirus deaths. Maybe, says. cases surging high right now, wouldn’t take granted risks virus. whatever reason, seems spread much right now, making extremely unsafe around people outside immediate household. you’re going it, really masks, period. I've hearing defenestration idea lately... Feels like something going down... Highly unlikely, 50% Americans refuse take vaccine That's kind. Please show literally anything saying virus classified living organism. turned 50 got MMR vaccine maybe 2 years ago. doctor asked pretty sure immunized everything, since know sure asked wanted (both shots). found vaccination record months later immunized child, hey, regrets boost. never mentioned titer. 🤷‍♀️ Maybe liability thing CVS. LabCorp

Quest Diagnostics 

Any Lab Test Now

There multiple labs, depending state, lab tests without doctor’s order. downside insurance won’t typically cover cost. Google: walk lab near mom's husband manager parts store. care people mask enforce it, matter corporate says. probably going lose job this. Wisconsin weird since Madison Milwaukee great places live rural Wisconsin get real rough really fast. Trump demand name picture it. He’ll probably says vaccine contains personal antibodies  That's 2500 day starting November 1st March 1st, way high.

We 900ish now, could get 2000, absolutely. would need get 4000 day end 2020 get high.

1000 day puts us 350k March 1st. sadly realistic. They're trying. corruption malfeasance politicians charge quite large, however. True. dont keep days anymore.  I’m Tarrant spending time Keller/Southlake area. 
Nearly everyone wearing masks here. Ah ok thanks letting know. Way answer question. also care history particular subreddit.

I'm also sure bit uptick deaths POSITIVITY RATE upticking bit. that's thing, pure alarmist silly even noting IMPORTANT context. say ""show I've alarmist untrue"". No, technically lying, everyone see agenda even provide simple context data provided. I'm data scientist matters you. Weeks? Days... Czech fucked much, ""Covid goodbye party Chsrles Bridge"" 15000 cases per day 10M country... still opened market like (actual photos) Unfortunately majority Americans believe social contract refuse wear mask. longer one one. Instead me, me, me. downtown forever cesspool grossness, suburbs around madison see everyone wear mask time inside. Even outdoor things like apple picking pumpkin patch people wearing mask. Buckle everyone, going reach whole new level.  pack shit relocate community recognizes work values them.  New Zealand hiring.

Clearly $$$ important peoples lives. I'm sure happening communities...guess paying tests. ""You're cab, eh""  Sweden try several months ago economy still sucked there? economy can't fixed virus situation fixed. could open everything 100% capacity tomorrow &amp; enough people smarter risk exposure virus, meaning economy saved, &amp; businesses operating thin margins need establishments booming keep lights on, let alone profit. [Cases time, 7 day average including worth clicking. 

tl;dr: Authorities admitted data hospitalizations currently “backlogged”, known figure higher corrected, give assurance corrected, won’t say much higher true figure is.

So, Austin, wait. Jailyard mentality taking said extreme way implied would advocate for. Beating shit crack addict gave police information dealer trying escape terrible circumstance pretty dramtically different discussed.  Disagree. Much grad school, admissions tests, professional licensing studies done via recordings remote meetings normal times. education terrible profs.  College works fine remotely cases. think hospitals would capacity cancer dieseases overrun covid19 hospital staff redeployed LTC? 'Maybe... Hmm... We'll think thinking it' -Merica exactly one, sure fucking large portion people. Enough going hurt us all. 

I work customer service, interface random public pretty regularly. Seriously, shit I've seen pandemic made fear safety (and Coronavirus, people want assault us...like wtf?) 

The reason everyone wears mask store ask people leave put one on. one, we'll even give one! Hell, 10 person limit store, seem least dozen times every day tell people many people. mean, group THIRTEEN people store already 8, \*WOULDN'T\* wait outside. 

Not mention person actively took mask getting close me, smirking, ignoring repeated pleading put mask. I'm fucking responsible party store. would feel really horrible people got sick store something could've prevented. 

Now, compare store next door, like Chipotle. 30 people crammed little store, even though space outside social distance. enforce it, lot workers wear masks. Suffice say, feel safe ordering there, mean, place can't serious pandemic, would serious kind food safety issue? 

Or people hanging around night parking lots 3-15 people groups, standing close one wearing mask. even describe methodology, researchers cite getting data.

And making stuff up. What, regarding child transmission school-sourced surges established scientists would contradict this? I'm dismissing skepticism anti-science, because, well, clearly informed it. Thank you. need sleep. True. Still low risk though Same, live Chicago suburbs

I went quick 10-minute walk neighborhood USPS collection box. saw maybe 20 people park/streets, single one wearing mask. One older man eyeballing giving dirty look, assume wearing mask

People listen, feel safe  Literally first paragraph article. Probably decree “religious persecution” Ha, US standards, 2x-2.5x expensive Italian one surprisingly cheap :-( Well covid19 led hospitals cancel people staying home due deal covid19 hospitalization hospital staff also deployed LTC

If lockdown spring, covid19 cancer deaths would've higher companies actually skipped animal trials went straight human testing 

What companies this?  Every teacher country deserves massive raise! I'm exmormon, leaving changes relationship family forever cases. officially shun you, beleive ruined eternal family unit afterlife (you can't go heaven them), pretty fucking heavy. Sounds like prison. Oh, concerned polities... 

I'm 40 want kill parents. reality they’re aiming vaccine 50% efficacy.

That's they're ""aiming for"". That's minimum allowed efficacy. They're ""aiming"" much higher. Also recently, upped 60% starting hit rural areas south. Like 10 250 cases little week small counties one believed real either, starting now. takes virus little bit time get Podunk nowhere, getting there, takes one church service trip Piggly Wiggly entire town get hospital go shut down. people going start realizing thing joke, I'm disappointed taken us getting shitty place people wake up. love getting downvoted speaking truth, deliciously ironic. even garden variety evangelicals annoyed.

Each one crazier next... still wished harm mentioned. Immature kids attend school wholly unsupervised shit Remind I'm supposed cover nose mask not. part confuses me.  medication prophylaxis ability. like truvada hiv/aids. masks threat would near nonexistent. *He. Also don’t think dismissing tens thousands medical practioners experts - three being... well, employed confirmed three highly respected institutions - fair. worth listening now? Whose authority counts most... credibility scientist subject employs appoints them? Prior GBD, would considered highly respected scientists rightfully so. minute even much interact AIER credibility, worked entire lifetime, forfeit? Seems bit harsh me.

Don’t get wrong, climate science denial gets skin like nothing else, connection two tenuous it’s hatchet job say they’re ‘allied’ meaningful way, AIER actual influence... afraid 2 weeks czech situation

I blame afraid, heard today Czech getting tests, 30%(!) coming back positive. still think unmasked people coming stores coughing help, helping matters. fucked way show community solidarity. mean im fairly happy state. visited texas earlier year mandatory masks place. Overall I'm actually pleasantly surprised Corona handled. could much worse. Aside opinion though there's nothing really wear mask follow rules. Perhaps OP losing sleep kids per se, potential might infect someone important lives. Please look systems theory; everyone's personal impact far larger individual selves, impact always proximate immediate. Well, course can't definitively say. rare able definitely confirm anything science. look data evidence best interpret that. guarantee said opposite, schools causes spikes, people question it.

Again, subreddit seems love science findings go biases assumptions. Yup, that's mom 🤦‍♀️

then sent counter videos doctors others explaining that's case, that's case, system really works, said,""well I'm going listen they're biased!""

....cool, Facebook feed isn't? I'm thinking new business model patterned speakeasies "" Donnie sent me"" bar masks. /s...Now could keep 21 days.!!.. know what..14 days found last pandemic. one prior president locked mess right down. personally thought longer transmission window. no, somebody understands science works doesn’t make conspiracy theories. YES! That's point. stupid thing used go business pay attention people. event, watched event, people. That's want get back to.  say was? talking degree people pay attention. Mostly ups wikipedia puts 35%. easy surprised live coasts city venture out, crazies come fast comforting know always corrupt since day 1 saw COVID reports USA sitting top recommended YouTube decided take cursory glance comment section looking like-dislike ratio videos...pretty depressing, say least. business community needs step enforcement game. Yeah, pain low-paid shift workers minders security guards they're task train make public policy. private sector help curb outbreaks, otherwise revenues never recover. fucking frustrating.

Did know post office plan April send every American household free nixed Trump administration - think one easiest actions country could done save money lives. East Pittsburgh. Yeah closed churches awhile, every Sunday huge family’s went someones
House church food someone’s house. feel many people feel can’t get sick pass sickness family reason. live bishop would always church members weekend gatherings 15 mins ago saying 31 million people recovered. Hopefully you’re least challenging original belief. highly doubt people wearing masks public people heavily believing herd immunity wearing mask help cause achieving don’t get it’s choice health rather health everyone around them.

Don’t get? don’t care. Ireland early deliveries? 

If personnel Pfizer Irish division able make statements early delivery plans, indicates manufacturing done Ireland, may why.  

But 'think one state preferential treatment rollout Covid vaccine, priorities set worldwide. scroll back slider bar include date range want. happened choose recent.

analyzing impact also requires analyzing starting position.  hate. Avoid politics. info. facebook shithole, brother's school pages full soccer moms spewing crap Please remember keep discussion topic. Off-topic political discussion allowed per Rule 4. Thank you! ""The virus changed one bit"" true. Check really cool project called information. Cool. absolutely nothing that. What’s source? Late next week. Well one piece good news today. Agreed r/rona mass protections Today drank 200 beers still drunk. also lottery died. see BNO News, Coronavirus OGs know shits get real. People pay attention hospitals literally everywhere run capacity, absolutely ludicrous numbers posted, talk rolling back reopening plans states happens, guarantee you. We’re talking unfathomable surge happening nearly every region country. think impact politicization mask usage?

That's exactly reduces spread save American lives

Anything saves lives worth it, mandating it, great idea February March, pointless.

People made minds care hurts. [He’s like cut him. people want play modest months rapid tests replace that, lockdowns last measure, damaging economy.

It's efficiency. Closing party industry meeting friends Zoom prevent locking schools months later, repercussions parents GDP-relevant innovation.
It also prevent dramatic shift spending seen high-prevalence areas US.   far right misinformation campaign incredibly effective sowing doubt amongst voters regarding 'fake news' sites like cnn nyt used pretty much universally regarded trustworthy news sources dress Joker that? Looking comments clear *actually* care poverty Africa, Latin America Caribbean, Middle East Asia way using excuse criticize COVID restrictions. /s

As said lack empathy. wholly unconcerned could happen others long get exercise ""freedom"". remember heavily voted mocked daring suggest 330 million population 75% infected achieve herd immunity 1% death rate could mean 1 million dead.

I happy able say told sub.

People take still take covid seriously enough. someone cancer dies sad infect 1000 people kill dozens them.

COVID absolutely priority everything else. still beating dead horse? Someone post mirror full article please. God bless.   I'm saying I'm going sit around worry disease may already never known may kill 10 years.

A lot things may kill 10 years. would large waste life sat around thinking time.

Never say ignore either. keep projecting. tried that... people became belligerent violent county. buying Trump merchandise chanting Trump! Also parades... 4 years parades.

I quite content continue cycle work, home, grocery store, dog walks long needed. ""they get $18,000 covid case! deaths fabricated also says pneumonia death certificate!"" god hate people OK, know going downvote me, right now, wish living Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. sitting county hundreds new cases every day, think one even get phone call Public Health discuss quarantine determine outbreak particular area business ... find person needs assistance accessing medical care. 

There accountability Federal level, State level, County level, employers, far individuals, hopefully 70% might responsible, stay positive make efforts keep family members safe quickly notify contacts employers. 

The system broken people dying. mortality rate gone down, people still dying, faster soldiers go war. Seems like government entities given up. numbers high, guess feel actions take would futile. Shh! It’s alarm bells going eight months, one energy panic anymore. people give shit already can, people don’t give shit never will. Nothing getting better. There’s pretty much nothing layperson do, either, course you’re seeing huge response. scream cry day long close news keep trying focus personally control. people choosing latter. get enough leave cover absence? Teachers know get like 3-5 sick days entire year. school system going like “lol, you’re getting paid days, also you’re going get written unexcused absences,” it’s surprise shit going happen. people careless staying home. They’re also socially distancing consistently wearing masks. It’s mandated pretty much one wears them. mandate would go 1/5 people grocery store 4/5 grocery store wearing them. Least concerns , virus climate change kill us first Yeah sure. guy roof, heart attack, falls roof gets run bus. Corona death. sheeple naive, hurts. Probably indicative higher general spread virus though... peak come nowhere. tried bioterrorism Thanks good faith discussion. pleasant day. Various things play people stubborn stay home, can't stay home, many even know mild think allergies.  realize bring Fauci blatantly lied want people go buy masks. He's liable anti-maskers trump what's worse medical credentials. gonna lie say make homemade masks instead saying they're useless Fair thinking economics surrounding virus actually affecting anyone. sleep lot sounder.

Again, never said anything wearing mask.

Keep beating dead horse too. testing people 2-4 symptomps.

You take commercial test expensive. think biggest problem even called strict enforcement, ton Republican run police departments would refuse enforce anyways. that. Germany travel happy land. since usual travel countries labeled high risk areas people traveled across Germany.

Berlin - Munich train car, sightseeing two days, back Berlin. course hotel room Munich, ate nice steaks restaurants visited kinds places; make sure pick virus transport place existed. But, two hundred pictures phone send family members friends show awesome life is. 

In home town 60k people 2 teachers two schools &amp; 10 restaurant staff one restaurant infected last week. f\*\*\* virus getting here; rain sky randomly? You’ll hold outs bitching virus still circulating flaring post vaccine, even people moved on. Yup nurse practitioner like “there isn’t research showing prevents covid” it’s like.... anything helps woman. studies showing lessens risk lot  Exactly. I've people dinner. three people, know go nowhere shopping, masks bought some. house place get decent dinner,so every two weeks. I'm serious masks one people ex husband. still bought mask. Yeah enforcement either mostly effortless impossible. live area everyone it, peer pressure enough make enforcement difficult. don’t need cops enough people trying defiant individual property owners keep people accountable. places store owners don’t give shit? Good luck. live San Diego suburb ""health order"" wear masks. Masks around 99% shopping, people take eat. One two times I've seen face shields mask (which seems mask). One time got car forgot put mask people ogled like forgot pants. hand one wears mask beach all. seen tattoo faced gangsters running masks

the mask tattooed face  ""indirectly"" saying want kill grandma minimizing virus! 


/s honestly crystal clear you. seem bit dense.  spent 3 weeks exploring areas CO. say less 25% population wears masks CO big fat fucking lie. guy hypocritical douche So, wave/surge completely devastates humanity? need wait two weeks? can’t take constant anxiety anymore, I’m so, exhausted. followed Trump’s impeccable plan. told us yesterday rally done Covid soon States.   /s question right trust scientists working CCP Trump? answer neither. Right it’s looking good. family fiancee's family take seriously anymore. fiancee started take less seriously since moving back family temporarily (no one city wearing masks despite mandate). really worried even worried without insurance month January. fucking hate helpless feel. already left. came home pack rest things. March 12. Sigh. Im fucking ashamed country. Making mountain molehill. judging quite word way think have? Oh myyyyyy Speeding law though, wearing mask isnt. There's legal penalty wearing mask. cops cant invent fine give people causing insane amount harm

You're causing harm keep downplaying severity virus. constant downplaying leads take study worth grain salt doesn’t mean shit grand scheme things. 

This study means shit point study stress importance wearing masks based RESEARCH, ""fear-mongering"" love believe. Speaking potential lunatics, federal government telling people wear masks would people purposely speeding, government said can't. would shitshow.  sounds like lost somebody knew. not, that's lot empathy. huh? actually close March/April country from? hate anything, curious. America least, tends moderate liberals. really really want return ""normal"" things before, good lot people, means moderate liberals actually conservative.

There pretty active amount Americans legit leftists nowadays pretty active street. tend look Capitalism problem. afford that? debt level almost double GDP correct?  Corner rounded  closed (source) Windows! ReactOS, open (source) Windows (reimplementation) great! course something large numbers seeing, also due fact virus much widespread thats priceless Statistics

the practice science collecting analyzing numerical data large quantities, especially purpose inferring proportions whole representative sample Hell, Biden could probably justify grounding interstate flights citing 18th century Philadelphia/NYC travel ban precedent. See that's better measure number cases. Still near situation march/April yet.  BIGGEST PANDEMIC EVER! agree. “I everything right” implies idea got home, reality knows exactly got in.

Subtle omissions like helpful. Would still amount 99.9 % survival rate G.aslight

WHAT? Trickle economics!

A new branch economics gained popularity 2021 goal help wealthy maintain current standard living. 

It achieved nation supporting growing struggling working class tax breaks, debt relief, government subsidies gradually worked way pockets wealthy too-big-to-fail policies/legislation enacted 2008 recession. Tbf horrifying cause people knew could lead this. 83,000 likely going remain record. Holy shit. people still think he's well... is. ""hErD ImMuNiTy"" attend superspreader events chanting ""mUH fReEdOM"" Constructive interference best thought evening. initial feeling additional restrictions reduced rate virus spread therefor reduced number lives lost.
But quantify actual effect Norways decision? (atleast rough estimate) 
I found article convenient graphs comparing development. cherry-picking numbers reasoning think learned much. noted stuff. 12th March Norway way ahead Sweden registered cases per capita, deaths way around. 7 0 accumulated deaths! Peak daily deaths 7 day average 15th VS 18th April, huge difference. 
I think would like see impact one isolated policy change Norway well known spread virus, also Sweden change.
The number want look number infections per day (right?) possible know. Confirmed cases would next choice guess test capacity strategy makes comparison non trivial. Hospitalizations would relevant, stochastic delay infection dependent group gets infected. ICU death similarly worse.
I come conclusion think bit bold stating numbers speak themselves? forget even within Sweden huge variations hard pandemic hit. 100 deaths per 100k stockholm region VS 20 Skåne. Though would like 5 Norway whole. 🙂 must fight war Christmas

I work distribution currently shipping cheap Christmas decorations toys made China imported US sale. suddenly struck intense wave saddness day human cost items, especially global pandemic. 

The high human cost always present items, struck new way saw box cheap shit break one use essentially disposable trash. considered someone factory side world work global pandemic make things. people work ship US clear proper import channels deliver warehouse. truck driver likely work extended hours pandemic deliver - (just) food, essential items, brittle plastic christmas ornaments arrive warehouse mostly broken sell store like $1.

I work 12 hour work day understaffing due global pandemic order get fabulous items shipped stores, stockers cashiers staff work public facing jobs, global pandemic make sure products available sale. 

Without doubt - somewhere supply chain - covid deaths, continue be. world refuses stop. understand full well economic issues things absolutely need keep going. feels sad know people literally going die, already, people useless shit celebrate upcoming holidays meant thankful, birth someone consider savior. 

Now ever life, really wish could call holiday season off. :( I’m also sick school science projects get touted revolutionary discoveries. Sticking graphs board making model doesn’t make science. Makes sense, extrapolating COVID antibody survey showed 5% antibody countrywide. born last month It’s appalling hear happening country. I’m lucky enough live county county-wide testing. I’ve able test every week (I work education guilty dining outdoors) appointment, it’s literal 10 minute process 2-4 day response rate. wonder it’s taking long parts country achieve same. family organising big get together 15 people living room, almost 60, majority heart conditions diabetes. 87-year old grandfather coming. They're mad showing up. get paying respect grandmother passed away recently important, I'd rather funeral family anytime soon. Oddly enough outside guests they're really careful general, seem think family magically endears virus spread. relative enter case death data every case 5% state (NJ). EMTs police known house reporting covid. april took 12 hours day. vroke crying several times. enough data see really horrible shit. one example gave single mother died 2 teenage kids got infected. kids quarantined home, funeral mother, sick parent care them. fatigue, denial. Can’t wait get old one give fuck rot awful shitty nursing home awful shitty body others look disgust ugly wrinkled face :) ever think gonna happen take walk road regret, sometimes take left double alley never come back. Put fucking mask on!! lol think thing people missing. real whole thing gets someone close gets really bad. stops political it’s late then. That's makes Fauci Bird's timidity extra cowardly. nothing lose vocal honest know they'll gone Trump's second term anyway.  One students one case hospital worked whole place shut two weeks. case hush hushed prevent stigma place. One residents really afraid becoming first person region get covid (he anything prevent tho). intense. 

Now someone circle gets covid like 'ay stay safe yeah'. saying circle turning spiral? American here. country afford free healthcare program, don't. That's exactly problem. India, reporting error, everyone getting is, taking tests. various reasons - poverty, education, etc.

However, know big reporting error. seen yet - why's nonsense? We're number one shot fucking airliner Excess mortality public data. Based that, number around total 206.000 excess deaths pandemic. Impissible say many directly indirectly related coronavirus, certainly closer reality registered coronavirus deaths. 

If read spanish, TVE (spanish public broadcaster) done quite good work breaking data study published Nature I'm guessing ton babies weigh 100+ pounds babies. There's smaller variance weight babies smaller impact vaccine effectiveness.  Meanwhile trump still isnt claiming full responsibility. flattened it. straight line going up. march 238th. wonder next person brings Ioannidis study tell us all, cfr actually low worry. Full ICU's tell us opposite. ""BuT PeEr RevIeWeD! ""
Thank god. Someone tell doctors nurses situation completely normal. Maybe forgot room two empty beds left hospital. would natural compare Sweden Scandinavian countries big central European countries large international hubs. Yeah, Republicans running Illinois ground. first noticed covid total deaths worldwide 6 cases 300ish.

ah good old days. Switzerland reporting equivalent 200,000 US cases muhfuckin tsunami Yeah right, regarding antibodies. Fun fact, 99.999% Americans survived 911, infections required fridge trucks storing bodies UHauls

And 0.1% 330 million 330k, excess death already 300k ""only"" \~3% population infected. 

Even assume true numbers double US officials admit, that's still 1-2% death rate translates \~3 million death US, that's without hospitals overwhelmed. Damn....I coupon titer says need one....I'm gonna grab today. India also well global average (147. 6/1M) 85/1M. good example misinformation. made statement knowing people never check anything. FoxNews many stories right homepage. recent one posted less hour ago.

""Over 1,000 New Yorkers hospitalized COVID-19, state’s highest level since June""

Herd immunity. never national hard lock down. don’t know happen January, it’s long time then. lockdown would worthless right now. Half population would ignore lockdown government would refuse punish so. Gods hate country... schools back since August 20th option keep kids home virtual (which chose kids). Well last week high school nearest us shut went virtual outbreak possibly related homecoming parties.they closed til least next friday, making 2 weeks. 2 others across town also closed. I've getting calls kids elementary school COVID cases every week finally middle school called first known case. 


The parents complain shutting high schools care kids attending parties part outside school. areas already third wave, nuts. kind like Bart trying eat electric cupcake. NRA harboring russian spy What? get numbers, studies varies ICU rates 5% keep mind study intensive care, hospitalizations (like someone watch could need ICU).

If combine high spread rate disease means downplaying lot disease. country world afford ICU 5% population arc couple months. fucking awful get shit like (Republican politicians+police encouraging places violate health law hate much confidence crushing curve early on. Humans love ""we it, virus gone"" fallacy can't feel exponential growth homes.
It's pity across Europe. ??? what??? u know vaccines like candies given every random person... 

masks social-distancing stuff major part everyones life late 21... care single mom jobless following strict regulations best way help her. reason shitty state October many people didn’t follow basic directions last 5 months. never actually got cases point could safely interact convene groups without spiking again. actually things right way wouldn’t position.. exactly experts saying since start thing. Speaking behalf Americans, thank you...cough cough. Oh please, stop nonsense. Belgium going towards 20 000 cases day population 11 000 000. Cases aren’t deaths cowards Inactivated vaccines tend higher risk that: inactivated vaccine Sinopharm tested UAE/Bahrain minimal side effects pauses even risk assume low. Humanity's interpretation 'natural law' biggest contagion think of. inbred-looking giggling hick laughed day ""putting face panties."" ignored him, kept repeating ""face panties"" louder louder. 

There one insecure person room, me. record, like piña coladas. yeah family decided get involved halloween hope keep way christmas new year   ...and 99.9% survive it. finally stop covid panic madness give deadly infections like nosocomial infection attention? Well good question PDF eurostat shows rise additional deaths europe cause. could lot deaths seem unrelated fact due covid. how's bunker?  guys days away beating India's record! depend vaccine. found work well 90% people, fewer need order achieve something like herd immunity. works 50-60% people, many need achieve effect. yes, vaccine works well 50-60% people meet criteria approval distribution, understand.

There almost way really assert debate quickly things return normal understand vaccine’s efficacy. blamed yellows Ok ~~undefeated~~ defeated, whooo It’s kinda like nascar racing.... lol Excellently stated. Thank you. Thank goodness disappeared Easter, summer. told responsible community action could stop it. Wear damn mask. feel like people care anymore. Right. cases high states summer people didnt want stuff outside. That's I'm trying say. know Europe btw, lived Germany 6 years. also lived im Texas first 19 years. currently living DC. well aware different climates. millions die, 10-20% hospitalized may serious issues rest lives... higher percentage people die due hospitals overloaded. healthcare system breaks apart. economy would hit much, much worse many people die. people stay home anyway. concept also lead new strains popping up, thus second third pandemics deal potentially, well constant plague us forever. we're basically barreling toward thing forever climate change current administration. truly insane, sad many people ""over it"" actually peaking Winning! We're No. 3, actually wait previous one subside first, peaks keep getting higher higher. That's constructive interference! hamburgers.

""it's going away"" said far recently I'm comfortable 1) depends upon age group, e.g., estimated 0.1% (1 thousand) infection death rate ages 25 44, 4.8% (1 21) 64 75, 14% 75+.

2) even though likely survive, may well life altering complications (stroke, kidney disease, heart damage, brain damage, lung damage, etc.). Regardless stop this, people think others, nobody deserves suffer. hope everything works better wish people would try keep moving forward attempt live happier life. love wish best yours. 

 need ear, two, need heart one well, everyone me. Europe != EU. populous european country part EU, alone 140M resdients. ~80% russian population lives european part.

SMH easy understand! 99% survival getting downvoted ridiculous buddies mine medical school military scholarships got deployed rural American hospitals help fight.

These hospitals much able keep up.

And patients deny covid-19 even given high flow O2 screened remdesivir...

And it’s non stop, endless flow idiots. Seriously don’t complain, great initiative . Currently reliant cheaper overseas reliant vaccines, USA, China... nah brah it’s dog eat dog world make shit cause nobody else give vaccines first peoples needs.

You’re idiot don’t support Canadian. Tested, verified Canadian health certified Canadian...

Nothing better.

Want cheaper, move China see works you. count it. 

We'll hit 500k deaths next summer, maybe even end spring 2021. doubt mind that.

This live now. 40% Americans say take vaccine. COVID going away time soon, ever. already seen people die reinfection knows effective vaccines be. Virologists warned us decades listen. pay piper. USA USA USA!!  Could rolled flu shot? almost feel like edit first comment, kinda scared bit, turns *do* explicit reason got yet implies complete opposite. Well may pretty clear westerners much better. bit complacency, bit seasonal changes, leads change behaviour. point US second wave summer, like third wave.  fucked Eye details 10/10. Marginally worse eHarmony. reason open bills come mail. Winter coming They've already said vaccines last maximum 6 months take one can't take vaccine once. understand everything spends work for? save lost revenue, he's already overspent beyond point. What's life worth? one currently 40 ever retiring apparently cost. Us. Greatest cases count! Woot, biggly hope document courts. know relationship ex, may good terms, huge may need evidence future grievances. “You 15 people, 15 within couple days going close *zero*."" -Trump February seriously hope don’t actually work public health attitude [ New Zealand economy deepest recession second-quarter GDP  Right. people &amp; records don’t go excess deaths though. yet logic didnt apply southern states dead middle summer? third wave.

We still are, we're fourth wave too. No, years ago much testing. /s According sorry excuse leader they’re “idiots.” Doctors nurses cry time Yeah I'm one brown people lived NYC 9/11.

NYC racist everyone else, America's version ""rallying"" Patriot Act 2 wars. enough rallying send us war, least... 'bout ""raising bar lowering bar"" 

learned new word today, thanks, friend. Same. went con whim friends last weekend February. Granted small niche convention, still... Like, knew Covid around, days later stocked dried foods *just case* survive grocery trips month time spring.

Oh sweet summer child then... feel like different person practically. they're sending kids back school district. That's hard pass me. trying say fucker? we’re people together? /S  it’s “America’s daily Chernobyl” Masks don’t even anything. fun wearing rest life. Hmmm getting paid 2 weeks u still gotta pay everything... Yeah that's really easy :) trying help make world better, working Doctors without Borders. Put words actions. No, indication things would same. would dead 'normal reasons'. anyone even care anymore..... def. first waves, worse testing. get 5 times worse US? deaths down? averaging around 700-800 day recently 1000. Hopefully ends day inauguration planet live on? Plenty people cry patient dies. every time, plenty. things good, keep mind another message article:


""While risk death COVID-19 minimal among younger people, health experts warn coronavirus pandemic increasingly driven people young 20 30 may symptoms all, pose danger much vulnerable elderly population."" taught public system think. using people's logic, 500,000-strong coalition military force ground China now. aged well *quote*

Irrelevant.

*Personal*

No, calling child behave badly personal attack. describing poor behavior since oblivious.

*None*

Yes, several are.

*Doctors*

No, proven restrict it.

*Experts*

Yes, experts corona experts fighting corona anywhere. Development countries take western experts time want improve. Experts adapt. Sweden development country needs help South Korea. Nothing wrong, expensive smartboards almost never got used. manuscript marked ""in press"" means accepted publication, peer-reviewed yet printed. clothes, medicine hungry, naked, sick sucks

That's Aesop I'm mistaken? Also Ohio. friends ""don't want hear virus anymore wearing masks part"" continue eat inside restaurants go social gatherings. No. essential business clearly hearsay work public I’ve seen. CDC pushed limiting gatherings 10 people it’s supposed 10 people. El Paso surrounding areas think long around 10 people you’re fine even different 10 people every day. Add state city government opening bars theaters, army base college filled young bored kids culture family oriented recipe huge community spread. 

If go out, wouldn’t even know hard hit lot flexibility schedule, routinely take lot extra work. surge worked lot, help coworkers. employers bother let know exposed coworker covid stopped taking extra. Fuck 'em. Insults prove points. awful! hope get therapy care assist this. No. enough. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get ready downvotes 😂 “ take full responsibility” Haha we’ll see learned anything pandemic next time one hits. 

Also it’s frustrating efforts actually worked it’s people best stay home others take advantage living lives numbers spike Living Shanghai, ""Armed guards every apartment door etc etc"" true.

At end January, Dr. Zhong Nanshan announced virus transmitted person person. next day, 40-50% people Shanghai wearing masks saw. aggravation epidemic situation, within week, almost 100% people Shanghai wore masks.

Americans can't imagine collective concept consciousness Chinese people. always think result oppressed.

Although individuals comply epidemic prevention regulations taken compulsory measures, indeed rare. MAYBE??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! time everything go shut thanksgiving weekend holidays kick high gear!! Anyone votes him, votes worse catastrophy already be. Good. Wake sheeple.  mid Jan 2021 late. 17.500 accurate, daily reports include several days test results (eg 22 okt stands reported 2.900 positives) weekly Belgium average 11.000 accurate. sure serious second wave. Better scared dumb told falsely quote me. uncivil. keep falsely quoting me.

When quote (which first three sentences post) false quote, something actually written. false quote would would make things up. can't take responsibility words write acting like small child, can't respond, can't argue, put fingers ears screaming ""I can't hear you"". Extremely embarrassing. know debates work.

Personal attacks good examples uncivil. complete fantasy Sweden unique laws makes unique can't battle corruption. 

I agree Sweden laws. Non applicable ""When will, way"". told you, embarrassing repeat myself.

Again, personal attacks. Also, break law politicians civil servants can't legally force people stay home (they can)

Doctors force specific individuals stay home proven dangerous communicable disease. FHM also put limited geographical areas lockdown. size area important; specific houses apartment buildings possible lock down, cities regions possible.

Here's quote Art. 8. Everyone shall  protected  relations  public institutions  deprivations personal liberty.  Swedish citizens shall also  respects  guaranteed freedom movement within Realm freedom depart Realm.  

As see freedom movement written constitution (""The instrument government"" 2nd chapter, article 8). could changed, would take years (as absolutely laughable seem think foreign experts can't take Swedish laws account.

But would really make experts deal Corona Sweden? need eradicate virus, objective.

Certainly been. Worked many countries, life pretty good now. country good governance, one HIGHEST DENSITIES people world also global financial hub. could go school face face basically whatever want. 

That’s government‘s response excellent. thats cause people actually use brains listen governments instructions. 

No, it’s massive difference enforcing compliance tiny/huge countries countries open/restrictive interpretations government authority (this saying “muh freedoms”, pointing Singapore reputation awesome strict). dont see happening anywhere west.

Again: countries west restrictive sense government, cultures hostile idea authority. 

To clear: *I’m saying value judgment* - I’m stating facts. significant difference western governments allowed interact populations re: restricting activities getting compliance. yes, US others EU still rising cases pretty fucking stupid people.

As literally every country earth. par Germany (not counting usual current week drop), four times neighbors Norway &amp; Finland.

If prevent huge winter wave, case numbers, actions CDC wastewater monitoring support, would cause? God's behavior? latter, behavior makes difference? head state passed covid? wow... many negative people could care less contributing world record. Hospitalized cases tend treated anti-inflammatory agents like dexamethasone anti-coagulation therapies like heparin. know virus kill organ inflammation blood clotting, therapies gone way reduce death rate. UK reported death rate hospitalized patients declined 6% 1.5% spring summer, least due better treatments. also experimental treatments like plasma infusion vitamin therapy, quite proven effective yet. always easy peice shit? feel fucking sorry parents around vile selfish trash 'human'. maybe they're reason are. Either way, first question still stands. Wisconsin first spillover case use field hospital. 

The threshold crossed. people going scared forever. here, also. honest, would easier watching poor old people die, dealing maskless psycopaths retail. People bad shit time, suffer consequences actions. touch emotionally see noncompliant diabetic lose foot. dying denialists same. mean much throwing “white” don’t pretend moment every African American host vigilant virus it’s dishonest convenient mouthpiece would great everyone safe issue minority here. people take precautions taking That's actually great idea parties hold end bargain. WI hospital worker here: morgue full bodies remain ICU days ago. Increased deaths coming.


We've seen states: infection rate spikes, deaths follow short later. : ( One ""highest"" conveniently forgetting mention Sweden also one nations correctly reports numbers. didn’t think going last entire year. rate might last 2 Commenting this. India? Serious bro? didn’t delete it. Mods deleted it. Reddit doesn’t like competing opinions. 

People don’t wear correctly. 

Masks haven’t clearly helped. 

Masks stop spit airborne viruses. 

Masks used panacea clearly not. 

There Danish study large, randomized controlled nobody publish afraid cut masking narrative bits. 

Plenty countries masking fine. Plenty countries masking fine. scientific opinion mixed issue. plenty infectious disease experts sold masks end solution.

Masks solution. 

Protect elderly (if even want protected will), let young risk meaningful aggravate way get it. President balls say we're turning corner debate Thursday.  surreal. 30%+ death rate surge. brutal. kinda wish he'd golfed entire time...

Seriously though.. Anyone leadership position knows longhaul, things get super stressful important get focus something else. helps think clear head. blame him... everything else... Well, US starts PCR test frozen food let us know. friend's dad sick bacterial pneumonia went hospital, doctor straight told sick enough admitted didnt room him. live northern Ohio would assume pod type situation. something similar two families know working home virtually schooling. 

We don’t inside hang outside rather normally. It’s helped us mentally. Love optimism not. objectively true. missing 90% infections Oregon number shocking saddening. coming driest low humidity days. Hoping rain picks numbers ramp down. horrific hateful callus people gotten administration. encouragement dismiss facts made many peoples' jobs impossible like charts: http://www.91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries-normalized&amp;highlight=United%20States&amp;show=25-lg&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=left&amp;extra=Belgium%2CFrance#countries-normalized zero false positives agenda blame shifting towards countries. want show nine months pandemic, countries still import virus China, burdening expensive measures.

If zero positives, easy dismiss actions unnecessary propaganda. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! UK island reacted far late. never shut borders quarantine strictly enforced. Fear within population back March high, people begging lockdown. government could enforced anything prevent spread people would complied without citizen/parliament push back. didn't. now, pandemic unfolded we're crossroads fear within public started dwindle fewer people happy comply restrictions.

It's government failings beginning pandemic. always cases unless isolate completely rest world. fear way many cases able enact New Zealand managed do, case keeping R rate down. Problem is, people losing livelihoods, wondering they're going feed kids amounts citizen push-back fear livelihoods ways risk pandemic whether agree not, people seen COVID hit close enough home warrant fear compliance leaders want. peace Lots places lockdown, try build field hospitals handle increased cases plus morgues handle increased deaths. Strawmen. Strawmen far eye see. Tuberculosis?? year trend would say yes - likely - subtracting covid deaths (58,6 per 100k) current Jan-sept number would extremely misleading considering factors play. choose believe you’re depressed doomscroller kinda wish he'd golfed entire time...

Seriously though.. Anyone leadership position knows longhaul, things get super stressful important get focus something else. helps think clear head. blame him... everything else... Colleges going kill tens thousands Americans co-morbidities.

The students fine though. Moderna encapsulating rna a
Lipid nanoparticle, read Pfizer Landlords bound HIPAA.

If dumbass tenant tells Covid, every right talk it, name names.  

""But privacy!"" telling business around, then. get ""test"" ""confirmed case"" confused? That's like going get tested syphilis thinking syphilis, test.

That's works. 100% enforced effective.

Neither speed limits.

But hefty fine, enforcement needed. 100% agree. many victories already taken different nations and/or people. 

Let’s catch 2022 Thank you, God bless you. I’m not. You’d lying say people wearing masks correctly end solution. Sure help wear right, lately people around liberal city acting like miracle cure, aren’t even wearing masks effective proper way. might part German. open windows every morning let air flow through. wonder possible make vaccine available wish administer without FDA confirmation. need eradicate virus, objective. Getting transmission rate naturally 1 without crazy restrictions goal.

Yeah perfect solution, neither current one. We're taking huge hits mental state, health care, economy, social lives, mental health care etc we're still getting infections losing lives.

It long large enough percentage population start resist measures, let alone lockdowns. can't contained 20-30% cooperate. know fact next summer paying big bucks necessary go party resort open things again. one checks huh fascist buddy? seems let anyone post here... based directly SCB (Statistical Central Bureau Sweden) data actually went straight database confirm claimed numbers line up. author old-timer stuck ancient platform - still always reliable data even sticks neck week. That's spin HFR -- Hospitalized Fatality Rate -- say even hospitals overflowing, fewer dying. regional mask mandates sure working great.  that's feel - take shot enjoy afterlife.  China virus treated unfairly. might say unfair. whatever I’m used it, ever see try hold wife’s hand debate? much ask people actually take pandemic seriously? Also weather make outdoor meetings/parties/eating impossible. good. *can't* test enough. places already massive delays test results infrastructure there. never meant wear around gf/child. think it’s dumb say everything right including wearing mask still got if
It magically went thru mask something. Like nah little germ human home  difficult determine asymptomatic cases people often seek tests. best estimates different sources saying 40-45% COVID-19 patients There’s big difference basic restrictions full lockdown curfew. support basic lockdowns like limiting large events, closing indoor activities, requiring distancing masks, etc. absolutely would support forced stay-at-home lockdown curfew. Circles way Hold on, gotta speed way fuck beat India. Words good president, have. 1 6 Americans kids food insecure. 
1 10 Americans living poverty. 
3 5 Americans can’t afford $500 bill. 
 
America makes 4% global population, 22% global prisoners.

Literally built foundation genocide slavery. Damn testing means new cases holy shit South Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand etc. 

China exactly unique Excess deaths add thousands total, get number later. Yeah, hospitals full death tolls instead. really doesn’t make sense. swear we’re like this, last four years really exposed disgusting streak American society thinking. normal, level headed people conversations shock disgust (in experience) without true solutions besides hope voting. It’s disillusioning see ignorant US. lockdowns? told we're rounding corner. lied to? I'm thinking we'll start seeing decrease starting around.... lets say late January so, strange reason federal government decide start declaring nationwide mandates deal lockdowns masks stuff. also one reasons whole national discourse botched coronavirus response mostly hooey. 

We've got many cultures present America teeth behind health departments. think response would better anyone else letting emotions get best you.

The simple fact prepared this, good learning mistakes, still getting better dealing it. 90% solution individuals responsible, know know idiots think they'll fine whatever, reason response gone poorly. Obviously wasn’t wearing mask around gf child. That’s silly wouldn’t effective/reasonable/sane. 


That said, don’t think way people wear masks effective nobody seems able wear right gives false sense security break social distancing. work great countries culture everyone wears correctly people distant (all Asia basically).   see comments like really lead conductive conversation. simply pointed articles linked stated basically said I'm hopeful newer treatment options improve long term effects come back comment like that. people divided polarized covid people immediately reach simple retorts like instead rational discussion based science facts. tRump blame. Pure simple lies American people borderline treasonous point. Yep early March thoughts kinda cringy recall hindsight. merried June early March talked ""what if"" worst case time make list key people we'd change plans 2/3 can't ""vital"" big deal..... Oh fast changed. (Wedding pushed June 2021 holding breath) clue fatality rate calculated? Actually. Pretty consistent too. talking america. drop. Fluctuations No👏 Consistent👏 Drops👏 Prove wrong with...

Good luck that. quantify that? save 2 million? Hey anyone beard tan randomly checked dozen times day NY. know holiday happened stay next two months sorted flights again. Good one!! -_#4':+:""*""!!!!!!""""!!-""""';jb. Gddjn

lol covid politicized, US least. 

How people encourage others go vote, realize covid politicized we're mess US (and places covid resurgences morons wearing masks, certain orange moron saying wear masks, saying months?) feel sorry deny reality world views happy so. True, far country don’t got tested retested since afternoon? Damn thats kind wild easy access instant tests  Oof, got fever afternoon... :[  honestly figured even contact tracing meaninful manner months ago? Everybody I've known gotten it, knew somebody it/exposed learned people. NE Indiana It’s national leadership problem, ok chances getting Covid lot higher that. That’s thing, we’re thanksgiving break continuing person mid December  care. Jesus Socrates executed Democratic court trial, think it’s fair say it’s nuanced saying authoritative governments good one thing least blind spell correctly… Bro. Wuhan locked great deal longer two weeks. like two half months. whole country locked three four weeks. 

There videos Wuhan several cities February, Vlogs westerners, etc. outside shots, looked completely deserted - 11mil people homes. people streets food deliveries volunteers. Melbourne, Australia. We’ve locked six months, got there! Vaccines may fully tested pushed politically health reasons. sub seems morbid obsession making people disagree dig graves. month old [this Forbes suggests 40% asymptomatic, link CDC reporting. without testing, lot uncertainty. difficult know many people infected, let alone many symptoms. HIT ACTUALLY LOWER. 20% OVERSHOOT! Enlighten me. opinion vulnerable people can’t work stay home, tax shit rich ensure people don’t starve. see solution isn’t needlessly cruel. Forcing people choose risking lives work starving unconscionable wealthiest country Earth. expected 9/11 kind rallying effort. 

I see bomb Tajikistan fact China hid virus weeks/months give random amendment constitution.

Or type 9/11 response thinking? It’s ok. They’ve moved herd immunity now. Socialism Argentinian Avatar Peronism. 15 minute tests everywhere part world. new test driving people get tested?  Dammit Trump, turned wrong corner like limit posts per capita hospitalization/mortality rates only? Overall case counts literally don’t matter. boss going vacation weekend. died little inside wanted unit happy her. Same! I'm Ohio too, many say symptoms minimal, big deal. angers care others &amp; see pain people can't visit loved ones hospital. China struggled authoritarian government scared regional government workings concealing instead trying deal it, let become widespread I’m teacher teaching person. surprises hasn’t widespread schools. takes one person high viral load infect lot people, prepare worst hope best. haven’t community spread, colleague died summer, danger there. wish funding protect people high risk jobs like ours. I’d go party pooper asshole. PPA. here, thought politics aren’t involved sub? wear mask stair master 35lb backpack on, inside. never goes nose I’ll 75 minutes without even lowering drink water. I’m 235lbs btw.

You wear fucking mask. bad. feel sorry you, world view.   pull masks sneeze get mask wet. Homelander represents Trumps attitude, likes attention, hates told no, thinks anything without legal ramifications. percent positive change though? That's 100% number looking at. We're testing positives, look percent positive (relatively) equal matter many people test we're ok job. number going bad sign. Exponential growth. murdered would even smaller percentage YET SOMEHOW STILL BAD.

For real disgusted creeps treat people's lives disposable. what? caused moral values similar terrorist? otherwise Daddy Trump looks bad. lockdowns bad imo, think it’s okay lockdown country first week maybe, organize health system, that. Oh sure, even covid rn still prefer living west overall urge look statistics asymptomatic rates. It’s lot common would think. 

Here one read recently. swear read one 20-40 year old women incredibly low rates symptoms boyfriend flew back Midwest Taipei end January. days later got sick respiratory thing. kind laughed getting sick 3/3 last pacific flights finally started wearing mask plane, refused he’s weirdo hadn’t much caught cold six years I’ve known him. *fucked,* lasted weeks. Doctors wouldn’t even engage coronavirus hadn’t China (which guess China would disagree w/e) eventually got better steroids, he’s honestly operating 80% since then. 

Nobody took seriously LONG. seemed like nobody weren’t testing anybody hadn’t literally huffing pangolin asshole Wuhan like mid-March, since nobody obviously dumb test anybody. something like that. Lol dumb. ""They -- -- cases, almost -- mean, literally, cases, automatically cure. automatically get better."" ~Trumpelstiltskin lot us experiencing U guys realize .02% population lol? Close. outliers care abortion, really care white-supremacy. Australia also island nation. yeah that’s fair criticism, nobody 100% correct comes covid Thank you. I'm austin tx, feel like I'm going crazy days. I'm trying cautious, stay put legit **NEED** go anywhere compared many around (my apts, people work, etc..) acting treating this, nice reminder likely ""extra"" whatever.

I hope continue staying safe, thank again! Australia three month lock there's still cases popping up.

Anyone thinks lock works lived one. There's also one tracing. seriousness, we're back normal time next year legitimately lost mind ^ Found guy needs read right here, Instead shitting someone's goodwill post. sub: skeptical towards lockdowns?

Me: mortality rate least going US? Multiple times. shut US government multiple times bitter tantrums. Winning. COVID great revealer, school different. Public education children boring, repetitive, dated, filled irrelevant information, frequently humiliating stressful, dispassionate, overall particularly good making anybody motivated happy anything.

It's based system designed keep kids occupied throughout day turn subservient factory workers, much changed except fact go insurance sales people instead steel millers. kind bullshit people see can't believe people still ignorant gullible enough believe. Right wing fairy tail propaganda bullshit that's obvious point treating believable lost cause. Woo-hoo!! don’t wear correctly. 

Not everyone wears correctly, many do. Either way, face absorbs droplets contain virus, even portion droplets, better haven’t clearly helped. 

I guess know center disease control, WHO, scientists doctors around stop spit airborne viruses. 

They stop portion airborne viruses well. said before, nothing worth used panacea clearly not. 

They're panacea, part reduction transmission therefore worth Danish study large, randomized controlled nobody publish afraid cut masking narrative bits. 

What study this? Link countries masking fine. Plenty countries masking fine. scientific opinion mixed issue. plenty infectious disease experts sold masks end solution.

The scientific opinion mixed end-all solution relevant way want be, I'm arguing end solution. I'm arguing reduces case transmission therefore worth even nothing, end solution. 

I never said that. I'm arguing part elderly (if even want protected will), **let young risk meaningful aggravate way get it.**

[You submitted support viewpoints, article said:

""While risk death COVID-19 minimal among younger people, health experts warn coronavirus pandemic increasingly driven people young 20 30 may symptoms all, pose danger much vulnerable elderly population. ""

But yet saying young people get live lives they're risk. know saying protect elderly, nowhere near simple. can't isolate 55 older, account 30% greater population. Everywhere go around people age group. Friend, seem concerned getting life even willing make sacrifices bit longer safety people 55 older. whole debate mass wearing. Myself, CDC, WHO, hospitals, health care workers, scientists around world support usage masks. I'm going leave want debate anymore. looks like all's called president Trump killed us could prevented cared us America. 

And want president stupid all. Interesting read comments. 

I live hood Long Beach, CA. know, Snoop Dog from. live far “the good part” LB.

Most everyone running masks stores. Rarely seen anyone without mask. Even seen tattoo faced gangsters running masks. 

Lot families walking running bicycles outside running masks. 

Of course drive 20min south Huntington Beach/Orange County (where girlfriend lives), white people seem immunity. maybe allergic masks. I’m making argument neither author.

We one robust transparent data collection world - creative bookkeeping going here. stats facts plain simple. hammer home - Sweden’s unexplained excess deaths worst months among lowest world. 

Where response failed clear people responsible admitted failure.

No one - challenge prove wrong - position power using argument end comment with. Needs free. way might win course. Yeah that's absolutely true. Risk factors dramatically increase age there's still people 70 dying COVID.  explain me, isn’t free?

Why keeping public safe, charged us? rich allowed safe.

Covid doesn’t care rich poor.
We shouldn’t either. live parents well. 65 since March mostly stayed home. grocery pickup drive thru’s get meals (I don’t energy cook every night ya know.) But, it’s getting much worse now. county highest one day new case rate, highest amount active cases since shit began. 

This week needed get groceries last 2 weeks. parents decided sign delivery house. load porch go mask leave grab stuff. don’t even want around pick clerks store anymore. And, started get take meals door dashed place too. feel uncomfortable.

My stepdad doctor’s appt 4th go sheriff’s dept day pick new gun license (he shoots hobby step brothers, hasn’t done since started won’t till ends license run don’t renew pay mint get back. But, scared going sheriff’s department. don’t trust cops town wear masks. mom gonna see mail house since he’s everything else get (picture, info) online. 

This making damned nervous. want us get covid everything us to. differently US, Italy deaths relatively low compared March. likely cases March really much higher, numbers got tested. hand, deaths US high compared infected, makes think that, like Italy rest Europe March, US actual cases much, much higher reported infected 23% territory. European population larger Asian population. feasible 95% countries. imagine SMELL place?

Old unused curdly clams aerosolised steam... musky, wet, fishy, moist, smell, feel throat...  First, course think get sick cautious take plenty quarantine time.

As said different thing something tested for. tests focus areas shed virus from. Understandably.
For me, government European Union deems safe, I'd take without doubt. Also, name J&amp;J name often associated vaccine. often call ""Dutch vaccine"" developed produced bij Janssen Pharmaceuticals Belgian Company. J&amp;J company owns Janssen now. WE’RE NUMBER ONE 🇺🇸 kind response team experts pandemics ready started... Sure anti-weed? Would love see tough guy's reaction responded with, ""You sure? tested positive."" Apparently people consider monetary inflation worse uncontrolled, deadly pandemic

Uhhhh, absolutely. Inflation causes poverty poverty one hell higher fatality rate virus April = .12 rate

Oct = .06 rate

that outstanding improvement accounts

why brought talk numbers? Oh we're beating US then, nice. Two every man, woman child! Idk cause French speaking part everyone wears masks everywhere need to. Well, there’s feel good story year.

Jesus. Fuck corona. Exactly. gonna work restaurants bars open. know patiently explaining Better scared dead can’t plug live? .05% low talking real life outcomes. video game, get see 1% chance getting poisoned think ""oh pretty much never happen""! dealing actual real fucking human death lot different. roll % never making roll anything life. family close friends grieving rest lives, near friends grieving months, acquaintances afraid stressed sad days weeks, entire world miss missed potential might added species. Christmas masked absolutely skipping. first christmas child. throwing aside. Yeah almost like Asia 7 times population 😄😅😂 ice cream shop New Hampshire closed owners wear masks.

Their response feel bad, stay home let everyone else live lives. Got sources back up? Exactly. narrative changes talking heads tell think. It’s best way would happen peacefully. gloves without? study done hospitalized patients.

Unfortunately **lot** people hospitalized COVID. One local hospital reported 40% current hospitalizations coronavirus patients. certainly would matter. small hand held fishing net would catch amount drag net. help, we're laughing Australia New Zealand....

Fingers cross golden twisty fails! infuriating many levels. wear fucking mask. God. I’ve never seen many people give less shit others life. 77% citizens life european part... russia Asia europe. Funny thing tried explain russian near Beat (that russia also asian country). know nothing Germany France cant much better. kids teachers emailed us day lesson plan 40 minutes week video call.

The purpose video call served reassure parents behind were. Im looking forward again. 48 per 100,000 Netherlands.s

19 per 100,000 US  fucked!!!!!!!! ""USA! USA!"" think missed point comment. This. don’t know regularly see cops masks on....indoors!!! 200k died pre morbidities. Go cdc research many pure covid deaths theres been. Look many people die year pneumonia, flu, cancer, obesity, car accidents, drug overdoses. think quarantine life! Lmao 80k new cases per day, US stuck 2m long! explain going beach, outdoor concert outdoor baseball game deadly protests perfectly safe! idiot think weren’t agenda driven corporate level, Delta much better others. refused corona bailout, saying money go cure instead, they’re one airlines hasn’t forcefully laid people off. US par Romania, recorded 4761 cases today, equivalent 81,000 US cases think bit farce college kids entirely selves dumb stupid behavior whatever. Sure party weekends. They're also stuffed overcrowded classrooms, maskless dining halls, community bathrooms, packed dormitories, 4-8 people apartments, every day week.

If freshman uni even wanted isolate would impossible. room public, eating public, bathroom public, classes public. Everyone make decisions, know personal life. responded comment said ""My in-laws got got better. using excuse come visit...""

There context made sound unreasonable.  Swedes try save face creative bookkeeping. Yes thousands people died government responded slowly criminal management elderly care homes, *but would died anyway matter*.

Sick. We’re number 1 question.

How pause vaccine trial?

Weren't participants already injected vaccine basically monitored every day?

Or pause basically transitioning phases trials specific issue resolved? forget stores extending black Friday several days thinking going better think bit good faith assessment situation needed. see wearing mask seem blatantly taking stand rather fully ignorant. countries around world lockdowns mitigate spread.

unfortunately, Europe massive infections too. nothing Chinese people everything realistic say *anything* 99.9% 1.4 billion people massive, geographically disparate country. starting get really similar 1918 pandemic… Shouted advice public health officials every step way telling people ignore masks, cases deaths could win reelection. could remembering wrong though. Sweden par Germany? Sweden four times deaths moment go deaths per million. Even confirmed case rate since start pandemic double amount Germany although Sweden really test enough spring.  Yeah get this. Cops love get revenue incoming ticky tack shit. like dream scenario. get posted outside every grocery store handing citations idiots. front line workers getting brunt this, health care workers getting worst it. Anyone front lines expected job shut up, meanwhile rest society gets act completely irresponsible. actually look thinking ""European Union"" first...

It good move. trump send national guard break protests? Government(s) US mandate anything politics.

Sure have. city mask order since April.

Enforcement different problem. guess holding big rally today, far field hospital? state cops literally supposed enforce it. best business wants customer removed customer leave call cops kick store. 

It's insane put mandate teeth. Granted, go grocery store 99% wearing masks. I'm sure simply going places people flaunting regularly. think help curb 1-2% flat selfish pricks cops could least hand citations. “This statement ridiculous don’t even need address it.”

YES, exactly never understand Chinese. agree sounds lie overkill. 30 years old feel safe risking coronavirus new vaccine It’s selfish 99% majority want live lives? No, selfish thing 1% expect everyone else change them. That’s like expecting everyone table watch eat fat guy trying lose weight. That’s great he’s trying better himself, people fine way are.

You responsible successes failures, one else. Individualism collectivism can't believe passed 100 per 100k *7 day* average yesterday, crazy. Nope. doctors charges $100 3-5 day result one insurance pay $150 rapid test gave pay cash for. noticed people seem milder symptoms catching covid right compared beginning pandemic. anyone else noticed this? guys understand people wearing masks. stopping spread virus. go outside everyone wearing mask even people alone mod r/Conservatives 'they'

of course. huge conspiracy. lockdowns showcase well country combat covid, otherwise Argentina get award locking really hard early back March barely cases. well countries able organize follow recent science, create proper protocols ventilation schools buildings. Also need react fast outbreaks isolate/quarantine properly. Asian countries better experienced this, Japan South-Korea never go heavy lockdowns well prepared organized are. Netherlands still denying role aerosols covid transmission, protocols proper ventilation buildings. seem think keeping 5ft distance washing hands enough, maybe wear mask go shopping. Germany seems bit exception here, better organized relatively well. Wrong. Finland suppressed daily infection rates 20 even single digits summer. Relaxed border restrictions led people bringing virus outside. two covid stories almost top, main story page battleground story (just show position others). page many covid stories. wish would tell readers science protection, cover covid suffering.  Maine Hawaii country. share federal government among things. Everyone new NASCAR metaphor. Italy last week. Pretty much everyone wearing masks distancing.

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone know think cases arising from? people consistently saw bending rules young adults interested partying/having fun. protests riots finally it. surge cases. thank god I’m gay. would want bring human world die Great Famine &amp; Water War 2045? know exact words. about? Terminology? Well let tell life dramatically made dismal due shut termed ""non-essential businesses"" insistence people stay home. that's shut-down, is? result, many businesses shut good, restaurant industry holding thread. lot what's going (sorry say forbidden word).....ridiculous! Like said months ago? fucking March. listened changing stance research virus became available everything says suddenly credibility more? like July 

We know lot know?
how know world hunger cannot ended really wanted to! guys ignoring huge increase testing countries 15 times first wave. Humanity survived plague  irresponsible people sleep around anyone meet party bar taking zero precautions.

I couldn’t tell data says country I’d suggest it’d worth investigation beyond assumption. experience knowing people who’ve unexpected pregnancies, 2 couples long-term committed relationships used contraception failed (IUD got dislodged), 1 bad advice doctor told years earlier she’ll never able kids due diagnosable disfunctional reproductive system.  endemic last year... (missed cases) U know why?? Cuz ppl parties villas dont give FUCK bully others stay home wussies life 99% people see live masks public. Maybe time admit wearing mask magic bullet makes COVID go away. painfully obvious ""wear masks"" people say zero fucking clue anything. We're already 12 months (almost 15 now) Oh Nicole don’t mean. Republicans still people - Constant doom gloom deadly virus we’re basically fucked every corner media 
- sucks, hope don’t die aforementioned deadly virus perhaps abysmal mental health that’s stemmed situation
- Stop dramatic
- make make sense. gtfo though gotta careful generalizing. East Asia, 99.9% people wear masks? ""climbing like crazy"" masks ineffective? Mandate, sort like govt saying strongly recommend something one actually abide by? Fuji industries (like many Japanese megacorps) follow footsteps Fortune 500 conglomerates old subdivisions every facet manufacturing distribution, even financial services. GM GE used like downsizing core competency became rallying cry across boardrooms 1990's. Eureka Springs: Ani Defranco played here, '90s. Ya go 15 miles direction though, like Austin, deep y'all-queda territory. ( ps, loved Austin, '75, 6) say wear mask? frankly government turned partisan issue. blizzard I'm sure covered like valid issue impact everyone. thing turned red vs blue, believe it, others don't. sad.  culture. Everyone memes scandinavians friends loners Like would really single fucking thing make people even angry rude. Still measures school. Except masks washing hands. Otherwise everyone sitting together online platform available. Ive seen kind attitude even outside Utah, live. People know actively trying avoid getting tested course ""have"" test positive therefore isolate avoid going places. really unethical sad going new norm think. already said it’s power play. want total control civilians totally defenseless push legislation want upon us without push back. 

Second, it’s 220k died covid underlying health issues. 6% people died strictly covid. I’m sorry live fear stats dieases reasons people dying every single day. ain’t republican, I’m independent voted sides past. wanna live fear means go it. don’t act like cunt bag cause won’t people matter live fear. Respect people’s views beliefs. can't put blame morons power, since morons voted pretty much reason they're reason moron listens see many morons listening it. [Very 😂 Sure cameras everywhere, really want officers less easily identifiable? Stop histrionics Great guys, keep protesting definitely speed process us getting rid horrible virus...

Although dont live country went lockdown like Italy much reaction curfew. means roughly 1 every 1,400 people France tested positive COVID-19 **just day**. positivity rate 16%, number undercount. per capita basis, it’s equivalent US reporting 240,000 cases single day. episode Daily, believe, doctor cited polio (I believe) parents would purposely infect kids small dose said there’d conversation around it, it’d bad idea States paralyzed way lockdown without massive financial bailouts...and barely roll back restrictions. it’s largely “let rip” strategy Inauguration Day (hopefully) and/or vaccine. report SS SS alerts Gestapo? 20% KS City today according MSNBC.... Yep, light ass know home mami daddy want friends little shit! Guy wants seem important. office thought like flu certainly majority wearing masks later on. Empiric experience say much effective. Europe climbs like crazy altough mask mandates. “Perhaps important factor level so-called community transmission: many new COVID-19 cases immediate area. Caitlin Rivers, assistant professor Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, told wouldn’t comfortable indoor dinner party right now, matter what. going risk it, it’s safer areas seeing five 10 new cases day per 100,000 people, test-positivity rate less 5 percent. Tom Tsai, health-policy professor Harvard, puts number slightly higher, 25 cases per 100,000.”


Austin hitting 8.8 new cases per 100,000 people positivity rate 3.3. I’m running bar feel like risk low enough hang another family also working school home. hope information helps people evaluate risk indoor socializing community.  Cases keep rising, ICU cases stopping, even minimal *for now*, exponential growth happening right eyes, get worse winter months. mean... Maybe could try actually enforcing it? fortunate enough insurance, suspect deductible urgent care clinic, doctor's office much lower that.

edit: DYAC We've tried nothing, we're ideas. Yes. temps get colder people spend time indoors escape cold number cases going go up. best way keep numbers stay outside, northern countries going harder time sub temps. US southern States like AZ case numbers high. 60 days temps 110 everyone hiding indoors AC making easier virus spread. 

If sick past still today, remember body undefeated trust always has. risk assessments, important believe body. dance covid July, worried getting less worried getting trust body knows do. someone high risk. around others higher risk rules engagement stricter. Covid death sentence. normal death number: around 1.7k per day .
edit: 15p high like... guys ever leave first wave?... Maybe they’re saying lunch. many people gathering arent anti science anti maskers. think grouping together disingenuous. Alot people want need see family friends I’ll wear mask required I’m going way anything personally tbh. South Korea still dealing 3-digit numbers every day. effective lockdown. hand, country full-scale lockdown (and used example ""without lockdowns still control virus!""), much better peers: masks, contact tracing, legal prosecution hosts illegal gathering, etc. Thanks, hate it. Ha ha lol Idaho. President defers Governors, Governors defer health districts, school districts, mayors. nothing make plan back anyway. yeah good idea always work. Probably actually serious would've closed flights everywhere, China. time that, already spread outside China useless cut China. 

But care. Remember recorded saying knew virus months nothing? Remember recorded saying purposely downplayed virus? No, infringing rights people think it’s good foundation dictatorship. may make mandates government property.

The people government property owned government. Assuming generation grew told squealing virtue.

If grocery chain objected behaviour premises, choose deal it. not, much feels like 'mind business'. shop bothered you. protests last part reason. also top known virus time concluded mask crucial general public made statement March even recommend DIY masks. Frontline workers dealing covid-19 patients day day hence much higher chance infection priority. guys acting like petulant child ""he lied"" refuse wear mask? fucking what? Spite? moron office made partisan issue live western washington seem wearing masks mandated. know karens luckily havent seen anyone wearing them. state little reasonable say Kentucky. r/iamverysmart opted online well, I'm Glade multiple outbreaks parents never notified. Bus drivers sick dozens teacher call offs explanation. superintendent area said kids effected schools stay open. 
Our kids virtual school vaccinated. far scroll get 1,000 NYer article? checked CTRL-Fed listed article that's 5 pages down. check posting (last night) zero COVID related articles first 10 pages. 

1000 dying daily they're acting like page 5 issue. article celebrity tweets page 1. Minimizing/ignoring/snarking issue disservice rest Americans. we’re not. live area put back modified stage 2. hospitals overrun, easily book test want to. kids schools haven’t shut go stores exact confidence always pandemic. difference wear masks like good little sheep, couldn’t spend Thanksgiving inlaws (not bad thing really) making backyard escape room children earn candy instead letting trick treat.  We’re fucked. economy hand.... Hm right, forgot Europe works. basically, closing restaurants. I’m saying source wrong. analysis conclusion data flawed though. look thread sources (SVT SCB) reason it’s flawed. 

And saying hoax conspiracy? seeing things. Take breath sober up. argument 1 percent death rate. CDC says.  Yep say. I've definitely meet people keep spitting line ""if sawdust get cracks mask helping protect me"" point. tell people tell responsibility.

These people shared backup generators, electricity, invited people homes safe massive blizzard hit years ago. Like get it, people came together crisis heartless one? Well understand care despicable. bartender, it’s really hard enforce mask mandates. People either forget put cool it, people huge dicks it. I’ve glassware thrown me, called names belittled, call dispatch forcefully remove people, people walk tabs tip nothing... sucks us put position enforce mandates. Still, I’ll take risk every time correct someone without mask on. 
I recently got Covid, likely work, even masks, it’s safe close proximity many people. I’m picking dirty glasses dishes, touching tables surfaces people touched, can’t distance 6 feet someone without mask... supposed do? Throw drink you? It’s safe situation know now, matter precautions people taking. 

I say I’m 100% certain masks help contain spread everyone wearing one. first night symptoms Covid, work middle shift. wasn’t well recognized symptom, stayed work thinking hungry something (dizzy spells). one worked night tested positive. masks distanced other, per guidelines, luckily pass Covid anyone staff. Wear masks!!! saw video youtube describing ""hogmod"". explains they'll never change.  Last estimate saw France \~6000 ICU beds. means 40% currently use COVID patients climbing. 210,000+ dOnT lEt cOnTrOl lIfE mean eternal eradication, agree also wishful hope, reasons mention, however, that's say ""constant eradication measures"".

China others shown way, whole world learn same. 

But Europe opening schools public life virus eradicated monitoring systems adequate, predictable results. hot take Dems Repubs basically plan. want avoid shutdowns cost, want distribute vaccine ASAP.

Now suspect Repubs win, everything autopilot FDA supply chain. DT say bunch shit kill trust vaccines (the vaccines I’m sure rolling Europe) probably lot mistakes distribution. autopilot.

Dems probably smoother roll vaccines, probably financial bailout/stimulus. 

But that’s extent difference. end citizens divided country continue going do, virus going continue going do, doesn’t matter President is. someone Austin, knows right? traveled NW AR, Austin area WAAAAY liberal, although San Antonio would also close second. No, two regional medical centers filling everyone across Southern Idaho sending overflow here. ones sent Portland Seattle Northern Idaho, morons article from. Werent alot protests Italy long ago forced lockdowns/forced usage masks?

Think remember seeing news. See got now... case please love god listen govt, get together We’re #1! We’re #1! heard Google book form opinions Reddit comment section shut flights China sooner lot countries, called xenophobic it. D4DnD President could make [national mask - problem enforcement. would feds enforce mandate, infrastructure manpower general, enforcing mask mandates challenge even states, leverage state local law enforcement apparatus enforce mandates(typically ticketing fines). general enforcement apparatus, however, available federal government, lacks states’ general police power and, discussed above, cannot commandeer state officers carry federal directives, risking enforcement gaps context federal public health regulations. ...and admitted it. told us why. issued corrections.

Wow terrible. publication loves christian homeschoolers.  Well give time. Also knowing MacArthur defiant following state mandates could see completely honest people working officials. Devolping nation also heavy sanctions. Yeah, pandemic changed lot, company manufacturing swamped orders mean capacity 1 year ago (with many staff working home, changes). There's also lot uncertainty, maybe suppliers struggling predicting produce amount next quarter, etc. Alternatively, said might supply demand driving prices up. see picture dead people sure EU decided this. way.

Doesn't matter, serves purpose. hard say, cases yes, definitely, testing much larger chunk actual cases were. Cases blow big time.

Hospitalisations, well lot cases younger time, need much bigger case numbers get hospitalisations past previous level. Still could happen.

Deaths, can't deny better job treatment logic applies. Gonna need *lot* cases see deaths. raw numbers game, bad surge actually is.

My guess case numbers climb 100,000 -120,000 per day US, see bad levels daily deaths saw earlier year NY/NJ.

Back then, US followed Europe 3 - 4 weeks behind, Europe dramatic case number rises already actually seeing deaths would expected considering normal time lag effect. numbers actually quite worrying.

Winter coming.

P.S. Looks like US set new daily case record... one reddest states  AaaaaaaaaaaaHhhhh went last week dentist wore N95 plastic face shield scraped teeth. office completely empty. worry it. do. ignore him. respect dedication. fucking way crap! Thats need stop trying slow spread amongst general population. old vulnerable protected. happens Flu, kills 650k ppl year. Italy like 8000 cases locked down. let physician get away that! Please insist female doctor one works women's health. 

I agree. lucky insurance lets see doctors. stopped seeing doctor beyond backwards. crucifix waiting room everything. Used words like ""out wedlock."" easily see half million deaths then. Raising curve? mean don't? think asking should/shouldn't, could/couldn't. start. Darker winter ahead said Build wall Build wall! Worldometer usually doesn’t finish updates 6pm PST whereas Covid Track seems publish updates around 3-4pm PST Turning corner, going circle. Germany lagging couple weeks behind rest Europe, trajectory same. really seems behind reassurances pleas caution general raising profile, leaders seem decided go Trump way enduring pandemic. pretty disheartening. several mean two states Mariana islands.

ETA. Nebraska Washington 2 states Better start popping research bubbles Yes, GIANT outdoor motorcycle protest. Serious question, everyone making 'that's equivalent XYZ states' lately? get inheritance faster way. Assuming get vaccine 2021 going treating recovering virus. 2022 first year get chance rebuild. Nobody wears masks everywhere permanently, even Japan. I'm talking public indoor places epidemic. rules vary province province (and township township). live (in Greater Buenos Aires, one places hardest lockdowns):

* Businesses open can't enter (attention sidewalk plexiglass) - around two months, basically businesses (crawled [a melting economy every decided open regardless govt said
* Schools Universities closed - (A dozen schools opened City Buenos Aires -not Province- [in open spaces kids last years high internet access home)
* Construction works allowed small works big advance rates
* Family reunions allowed week, open spaces, top 10 people
* Public transportation (which used here) allowed essential workers. considered ""essential"" (or get 48-hour special permit), [your transport card gets Nightclubs closed. Bars open tables sidewalks (mostly reservations) limited hours
* Gymnasiums allowed week (with limited capacity)
* Circulation provinces **very** restricted (in kind *internal borders* fashion). People [not allowed enter different province (after driving 3000 km) see family member (both without covid) [camped province [truckers allowed even make bathroom transiting provinces (which take many hours) since truck doors get sealed. cases people [dying trying bypass dirt [crossing bypass restrictons. even case [old man dying ambulance transporting refused access Domestic flights restarted week (only essential workers)

I think that's pretty much all. hope English clear think point won’t wide distribution vaccine 2022. multiple variants influenza strain. mutating virus therefore herd immunity reasonable expectation, especially combination death rate cures reported anonymously? know masks, Lithuania wear indoors since first wave (except eating sports) still seeing records numbers. feeling masks help long replaced every day (like suggested), however lot people keep using mask gets really dirty I'm afraid might even help spread disease taking mask keep transferring virus fingers mouth. Less people would better. WHAT?! depends phase drug trial Phase 1 trail purpose safety. Phase 2 it’s efficacy. user name checks effects definately happen men women. 
As man, I've experienced female partner two go well.

The best say meds use weeks RESET stuck pattern get hell them.
Now, 
Psilocybin EXCELLENT depression/ anxiety anything, likely promotes healthier patterns sexuality imho. 


What said regarding bias women 100% true. 
Don't let physician get away that! Please insist female doctor one works women's health.
I'm 46y/o man somehow ended baby/women's health doctor OHSU.
She's liberal, honest, realistic. unending respect her. Unfortunately, scenario referenced often true physicians well! 😔
We gotta get administration hell government work towards equality ALL.KINDS!
Best luck 😌 $2340-$3120 US depending insurance

Equivalent $66 India Celentano mi da’ l’ulcera :) see 1k deaths per day three four weeks Likely manufacturing capacity decreased due material shortages, reduced labor, COVID protocols reducing productivity. they're selling something that's increased demand right now. Either way basic economics dictates demand outpaces supply, increase prices. Processing orders also comes overhead cost makes sense prioritize larger orders bring money. mean like DIY scene? agree that. underground scene it’s at.  Bad things

It's lot bad things

That wishin' wishin' wishin' wishin'

They wishin' underestimated much passive exercise got switched working home, walking parking garage office, cafeteria one building over, etc. cardiovascular fitness toilet. get fatigued *so* easily previously easy tasks like schlepping groceries car carrying loads laundry around house. 

Obviously answer get ass make point going walks. damn, work kids’ virtual school never ending cooking decluttering, it’s hard feel motivated enough actually go *do* it.

ETA: fact prone depression doesn’t help matters. trying shit you, confirming - background think. really rounded corner Donny! ""Covid fatigue"" like call seems real thing France, honest. People mostly respected orders first (especially / right first lockdown), feels like good part society broke weeks ago stopped giving shit. actually totally agree ""two months"" statement.

In city south France, masks mandatory ago (I think among first cities so?) - I'd say like 90% people respected first wore mask **correctly**, much closer something like 50% now. Lots people wearing chin wearing all.

I'm blaming French public culture. People absolutely unable keep making efforts common good soon see even one person putting effort. would actually really surprised curfew going respected... said first time got it, scary catch breath. second time mild symptoms. must least briefly genuinely thought going die. think many people would lax experiencing firsthand. think would try everything could make sure happen again. would much east Asia. latest stats I’ve seen regarding colleges: 13,000,000 students gone back college (locked one way another) 2 reported Covid deaths. 

What kind guarantee safety waiting for? need 99.99999999999999% assurance instead 99.99999%. 

So brave you, lol. Given people aren’t disclosing it, it’s surprising. oxford vaccine require sub zero storage? second order blocked today Colorado. People stuck stupid moment. gotta help us, Doc. think instead maybe backing stuff places seem continuing open things kind lax rules. honestly seems like covid fatigue definitely set in. 

And Biden right, Flu stuff, going brutal winter. elected officials, President, ""Leaders"" failed us. argument wear masks indoors permanently, disagree you, least would consistent. actual point though, clear, settled, obvious science. Assessing cost/benefit requires measuring social economic cost trade-offs can't simply worked lab. work unless airlines maintain common no-fly list. infectious disease experts making recommendations political leaders. unironically lot people US think want, free every man mad max reality Everyone knows meant. Honestly, sensible thing every nation (that local epidemic control) follow example nations 14-day quarantines incoming travelers returning residents. include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, China, Finland, Georgia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore. better conducted travel quarantines, mandatory state facilities.

#### memba like gay bar, hats.   someone else...some human says mean correct cannot challenged. incorrect precedents. Maybe go back old precedents segregation...there legal precedents there. examples legal nonsense violated human rights life, freedom, property course asian woman... Several states haven’t updated yet. Worldometer usually gets final numbers bit 8:00 central time give piece life advice? want non-doctor dinner four, three doctors. October still hot Fl. look website, graph U.S. bottom right hand corner makes look like we're heading third wave higher first. Actually, nothing caused it. 

Take look logarithmic plot new cases EU:

[http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries&amp;highlight=European%20Union&amp;show=highlight-only&amp;y=both&amp;scale=log&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=left#countries](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries&amp;highlight=European%20Union&amp;show=highlight-only&amp;y=both&amp;scale=log&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=left#countries)

It's basically straight line starting July. means doubling time new cases 3 months. 

It's rate become alarming. That's exponential growth. FDA supposed take efficacy account approvals, evaluate safety? latter, understandable. hard-pressed find source confirm numbers 5 10 times tested positive for. Every time there's antibody study region, come lot people antibodies ever tested positive. home managers brace bad winter

El Paso winter? SHATTERS assertions untrue. US outcomes worse: ruling legal decision violates foundational laws (Constitution) void duty disobey ignore them. part control government Constitution. exceptions. ask lady permission perhaps go another way. criminal force. tyranny (by force) Yeah, nobody cares us means they’re actually going know, stay home, wear mask, make kind sacrifice...whatever. Bummer 

Beautiful landscapes human terrain challenging It’s impossible argue people live alternate reality. dont believe this, heard russia vaccine even work? Well played... Got double take me, darnmit. large degree difference full scale lockdowns attending super spreader events. watch ""the five days"" Dario Argento 300k excess deaths including Covid ones. Yeah like Bezos right? $$$$$$$$ Oh hello. Welcome back. missed you. Would mean self-reporting police? Easy contact tracing sure. Next week. half states reporting 1000+ cases now. never happened before. ""Flu"" 1 virus cover name whole family different viruses. It’s hard get boxed position  Wait, comment said study ""concluded drug provides benefit"". shortening patient's hospital stay big benefit, patient people needing hospital bed. provide benefit, it? post confused now.

If pill helped people get flu faster, people would call benefit they'd pay it. 双押好评 think LIAR thing got downvoted. 

 Anyway, always thought Norway lockdown although soft one, similar Swedens virtual/volontary lockdown spanish/australian ""housearrest"" lockdown. final shit fight Fallen West!

Which tribe ignorant flat earth savages win fight dank memes freedumbs amidst crumbling ruins civilisation. I'm really sure state live in, indicative experiences North Carolina. Myself, wife, neighbors tested local pharmacy. 100% free asked insurance not. wife's test results (during June surge) took longest come back 3 days. results came back 12 hours (in May) neighbors' came back 24 hours (earlier week). thought US ""rounding corner""? Europeans clealy amateurs. True look Europe beginning. first wave delayed US well. Please take care. Kinda like climate change? feel lucky sure seeing people hard time difficult. seems like wasnt wrong faith healing though.

The Church Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints (LDS) long history faith Adding that, there's also schools, kept open political reasons nearly areas. gov wants close last. Parents want able kids study home strong bias vs. digital learning. states kids even wear masks inside classroom inconvenient /s. START PUMPING SHIT THEN!!! LETS BANG OXFORD!!! that’s Asia least geographically ero molto più ditubante mesi fa sembra che funzionino più meno tutti come dovrebbero, è l'attesa che ci sta fregando Yeah, like pal gave HIV.

Fuck him. ""It enough America wins. Everybody else must lose。“ I'm even confused. Something smells fishy story *Insert astronaut meme*

Always been. nitpicking, numbers smaller. 180 000 people counties fit test requirements go rest country, 5.5 mil expected tested. say ok shoot innocent people? Please put words mouth. problem asking clarify something say making assumptions cool.

Pretty much saying ""Be consistent"". Stop pointing fingers people maybe, maybe attitude part problem. Stop ""white man devil syndrome"" accountability. Stop reflecting responsibility onto people end day dignity peace mind knowing right family best instill real values children next generation come tragic history black folks country. really feel like someone trying harm fall person does. means work harder everyone else get thing means give up.

Don't guy corner selling poison community wanna talk black lives matter, really believed living stereotypes tired done decades now. 

Just hypocrite crying loud. nerds rise again! passenger train nerd, remember got news blurb closed rail line serving Disney HongKong. closed closed HK Disney. think Jan. remember thinking ""To Mouse God bend knee?"" probably meant revolving rethoric. need large-scale lockdown curfew also need strictly enforce disease gone. Yeah I’ve since China locked down. girlfriend use call paranoid— well still lmfao guess right. It’s shitty feeling. sound bad. currently number, \*confirmed\* cases. 30% test positivity rate :) must banking fake vaccine Rump talking about. Anyone remember ""flattening curve"" thing? Unfortunately, surprising. Based sizable chunk population believes, actually expected. It’s ok numbers serve purpose anyways. It’s like administration basing decisions non-financial data. True, power bully pulpit power federal funding. Biden levers use recalcitrant governors.

Trump blatantly deriding masks months, becoming sorta OK them. Around 130,000 lives saved country adopted “universal” mask-wearing. personal stories I’ve hearing/reading, appears people let guard around family members friends. Close knit groups passing due wearing masks. Maybe people rightly felt original title sounded like something Trump would say? Expecting people didn’t socially distance contact trace!! confusing feedbags masks.


That mother fucker hungry.

Yeah, steroids make hungry. kind words would cut clutter whirlwind days? Cool lot people came together one location. became infected carried disease back home. Many probably even know infected. infected others infected others.

COVID get ND SD somehow neither bustling tourist trade. likely vector people leaving state, getting infected, bringing back home infecting others.

Ten weeks time period would expect see effect. people western democracy insufferable That's probably best case scenario. Probably much worst case scenario. Infections ... exponential.  Count fuck in!!! talking two different things. ""flu"" several different viruses.

Covid 1 virus mutates slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

The death rate covid virus 0.014% worlds population currently fucking gold. quote this? (with attribution course) recall reading article January describing 80 cases Wuhan, man fucks head. Lobbies? switzerland'a politics?

I thought any? Dickson bad. Go Houston, Humphreys Hickman want real meth show. Cant keep teens social time lives away friends. wife tested positive two weeks ago light cases mostly fatigue aches. honest, I’m wrestling glad we’ve virus. We’ll stick protocols, small comfort worry damned much. 

Be safe protect family virus random indiscriminate. May museum pieces one day. US asked info vaccines using method that. Trust starting network heavily. takes bit time get word (like DNS, ha).

Other poor attitudes/opinions, decent job actually, pandemic shined bright light shortcomings still vaccine. 1000 Idaho again. though Norway lockdown, right? county live in? removal politically biased it? Guy work today threw temper tantrum called pulls mask coughs. Dude went hour, tried play like messing could see getting worked it. Dude 58 years old big ""dems snowflakes"" sorta guy. impressive We’re 225k now, extra 275k deaths required hit 500k. It’s 100 days til Feb 1 would average 2,750 deaths day Feb hit mark. We’ve gone 1k deaths past days according Worldometers still take time even hit 2k per day I’m betting one.

There also possibility FDA emergency approval Covid vaccine time help reduction fatalities period. virus nerds FDA however probably pushing approval January I’ve read lately. 

This emergency approval might get pushed actually hit huge spike deaths general public saying, “WTF, approve vaccine!!” Yeah looked stats Italy, France, Germany cases spiking well. Antigen tests. takes 15 min it. good PCR test course much cheaper faster... idea reduce number infected people high virus load, sure call super-spreaders coz scientific evidence it. almost research global antigen testing experiment works game changer every one. based trial/pivot phase looks promising. course test 5m people - whole country require lots effort based trial possible. trials also resumed South Africa Japan several weeks ago Color skeptical, optimistic. Sorry. correct spelling potatoe. people virus. /s anyone following since Wuhan? remember discussing two three digit numbers different subreddit (r/China_Flu) back January. We've become numb numbers. remember mid-January, unit (reserve) annual training scheduled June Mongolia suddenly cancelled nobody knew why. Shoot, everywhere this? Good CO.  Like Biden said ""If success can't imagine failure would look like"". failure coming winter. dont think Trump legal right force everyone wear mask, I'm sure that's states rights. gonna cold winter.... [Safe work whole thing terrible idea medical justification.

The benefits make sense, steam change uterine lining. Unless throws childbirth (as baby literally leaving body today), uterus pretty closed cervix. catch wind hospital, I’m gonna take whatever get even close January. talking 4000+ dead day starting now. still lingering around 800-1200 range. catastrophic two months could get us 300k. straight line exponential growth tho. Seems like maybe went linear growth exponential one. Swapping wives along way.

A-yup. one things like Tamiflu helps take early much little late? Wow would look scientist right Hello fellow dev. Definitely look WFH. Tech companies still hiring pretty well. zero reason office work remotely. Maybe look large company? tend supportive WFH surprisingly. MS deemed indefinite. cushy would applying. Virginia, prior COVID, illegal wear mask public.

I assume exemption religious reasons. law probably reads something like wearing mask purpose hiding identity something like that. law. entirely. Australia NZ going well. Australia 1 local case yesterday. called Scott Atlas now. guys meet broom closet completely ignored. Honest Question - universal no-fly list? thought became thing 9/11   Except states hardest hit right density. Wait... North Dakota State US?

Ha! almost there. good one.

Nice. Every two months extend another year. wonder much money spent info campaigns Covid prevention vaccine knowledge, vs actual vaccine development. need ads like ultra gross sob stories used anti-smoking ads. need catchy slogans.  Delta fly list really punishment? Think it. I'll never forget looking phone seeing NYT update said, US reaches 1000 total cases. checked March 10th. next day NBA suspended season. Two days later last day physically work started working home. Everything moving fast then. ever since April whole thing felt like world's slowest moving car wreck. Wonder much Sturgis contributed that? Yeah, think that's another 200k February kept hearing. scary thing one takes account number excess deaths probably attributed Covid19 media reporting recently, another 200K supposedly. potentially past 1/2 million plus February. Scary stuff. Well, also Americans tend rosy view European countries everyone united around serious science-driven governments (besides UK course). true, although certainly propaganda tries convey message. Seems like everyday see ""biggest one day increase"" ""record broken"" mean, gonna ignore protests Poland numbering tens thousands? (abortion stuff)  lols

Yeah, need start smoking weed again. :shocked Pikachu face: keep also need aware what’s happening area make informed decisions think would change? Italy much better lockdown look now. point going come back seeing Europe mistake lol. misread. Deaths rising since week ago.  Record # new US cases today 79,570 counting. New record 28 states 1000 cases. New record 47 states 100 new cases today. New record 26 states double digit deaths. racist little twat Doctor tells patients responded positively Remdesivir treatment. Apparently shortened recovery time, made recovery less unpleasant. Which, far I've heard, ever *claimed* do.

I'll take Doctor's word FDA's 10 times 10. virus doesnt care group. data says large groups outside screaming, jumping, moving around doesnt spread virus reason ban outdoor events.

I'm looking data suggesting act accordingly _have you, influence alcohol, ever questioned teachings Mormon church?_ people going actually that. barely get idiots country wear masks. think case. People formed something like 10-15 person quaran-teams. People they’ve decided ok around. problem everyone different members quickly spread groups. every country failed state, failed states. Zoom replacement social interaction. many people, actually feel isolated alone Zoom. remember back March, world-o-meter approximately 20k covid cases day. there’s 77k US. Depressing. I’m suspicious anyone says something perfect bc they’re starting lie. assumes still steering something link paper published ALCU whoever curious read recommend primary device. things get bad many options. Remember Washington one case nobody took seriously? remember first patient came ER worried COVID. everybody see either COVID COVID recently. It’s absurd. Hot take. Easter..... Major US city here. Got tested recently &amp; months ago. 4-7 day waits results. second one, asked 7 day result clinic there’s short result time &amp; thankfully referred 48 hour result place. Got results 14 hours. That’s I’m saying. It’s totally absurd around 300 people wedding country 2nd worst hit. It’s like blame government well. government endlessly asked people follow safety procedures idea citizens think are. It’s like one behaves he/she would last person catch virus. It’s gonna sound absurd, situation 10x worse USA. 

I seen street vendors coming well what’s concerning bother wear masks. do, they’ll wear every possible way except correct one. grocery store week presence social distancing grocery store. People literally cough sneeze bare hands touch everything vicinity. 

It’s true infections India tend milder compared rest world we’ve still got elderly people underlying medical problems. concerning. cut July 2020, patient! Gonna nitpick

Time dilation faster move time slows down

Time feel moving pace - even different someone else's perspective

That's Fly around world 0.5speed light 24 hours feels like 24 hours - ground stationary observer much longer time.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit stationary relative plane flying earth stationary read Yep. round corner 4 times you’re back started. I’m sure he’s said “rounding corner” 4 times. Going dizzy soon keeps up. mean revolting. happy riots, happy stupid pro-government bullshit dead buried. deaths misleading bit it’s moving younger people. People looking like three heads say this... Well, they'll see time. Even illegal, regular people enforce law unless immediate danger. excuse. Common sense measures nationwide could cut really cut damage pandemic. Masks, reasonable social distancing, united response among states.

That takes. Businesses open. People need wear masks take precautions. Yet lot people actively masks happily form giant crowds partying.

I believe it’s okay take reasonable risk socialize, public, see friends etc. Two key rules. Keep gatherings limited capacity, wear masks. 

The curve flattened people exercising simple caution common sense. much ask lot people. biggest one-day increase record ... far. Almost certainly. put money I'd bet NCRI numbers closer truth. fake pro-government propaganda, absolutely nothing cheer for. horrible situation, pretending sort silver lining frankly ridiculous. Lol, there’s literally mountain scientific evidence telling virus almost effect whatsoever people 50 close eyes ears scream “I can’t hear you” like 4 year old. fact, would hazard guess scientific research supporting statement pretty much topic across human history. pretty purposefully dense miss that.  Great point. share links them?  now? full article case anyone can’t access National pickup trucks Providing sources arguing hell choice. Especially proven wrong Victoria peaked 725 day wave, yesterday 1 :) long rough winter aggressive action, quarantine measures place well positioned near eradicate it. Rest Australia COVID free except NSW odd single digit case numbers. Correlation bewteen cases deaths? followed rules 2 months essentially went back normal (minus working home). People tunnel vision don’t recognise extreme damage lockdowns inflict insufferable. fact governor can't distribute basic income people lockdown central government organization say gets what?

Even could, cannot help everyone lot people Southern Italy work 'legitimate' jobs e.g. cash hand comments sub make think lot people living assumption absolutely nothing improved since march Maybe go Christmas wear mask. neglected recognize that? excellent gave tiny spark hope. got long way go. still progress better nothing. don’t go confronting neighbours. France call cops, dept that. Especially now, they’re cracking curfew-breakers, they’d jiffy neighbours would never know called. care majority people understand what’s happening. People complying don’t make news. small population State communities think affected low population. State Montana major offender well. People still walking around like business usual lot still believe hoax. W  
 
 We're getting snow speak gonna get worse gets better get program. though late already. local community nothing bunch self centered idiots. There's even elderly walking around without using masks like nothing. 

 I'm high risk people care. I'm even worried wife's old employer disputed PUEC extension forcing appeal. Fortunately able secure job local Assisted living facility days ago scares even more. Thankfully test everyone rapidly entering provide N95 masks. 
 People get ""get it"".

Stay safe everyone. went Disney Universal Orlando February feels like years ago. Seeing family pictures big crowds surreal. “How dare move goalposts researching learning new things? Don’t know books devil’s playground?!” relate marches anyway? 

Are seriously trying argue marching street equivalent moving stadium? would locked properly first time, quarantine last longer 8 weeks. bad childish country. can't nice things. almost like deliberately hand-picked niceties post internet give impression people united around something.

People not. Reddit, source, gives unilateral coverage perceptions anywhere. Surely 2016 taught place now, necessary, two weeks time. Nah dude. us Millennials either early college / late high school. following recession hit families hurt futures. Keep mind testing severely limited well. I've seen lot first hand accounts way get covid test specific symptoms (taste/smell loss), need admitted hospital. Also back white house provide numbers opposed individual states. 

Since proven, opinion numbers reported far behind actual registered numbers, white house can't keep ""realistically"" fudging even looming election say flu??

I said ""flu"" family different viruses.

Corona 1 virus. Neglect recognise everyone mobile device tracked anyway. LOL, remember 100 countries blocked Koreans entering. tables turned indeed. important things still social distance saying, wearing mask washing hands.

Testing great need it, really going mitigate infection rate much unless there's tracking preventative measures taken public's taking enough preventative measures general that's going overwhelm mitigation efforts.

You can't necessarily rely masks especially since vary quality wildly still need social distancing limits many people building like 24 hours versus ventilation building fresh air exchange.

As weather gets colder people hang enclosed non-ventilated areas becomes little important remember masks block particles people particularly good masks. still need socially distance avoid crowds. India's cases downward trend, US rise. rugged individualism worst longer speak best man damned wedding. Breaks fucking heart grew south surprising. know, since one's driving pandemic moment one's 18 30. I'd advocate lock down. free 60+. (60+ virus becomes really problematic terms mortality, morbidity long-haulers start already 40+), forget 80+ threshold, true.

Somehow guess 18 - 30 range.  partial crowds. mean normal full crowds love winning we're right now? Thank god America great again!  According Trump, good news. everybody catches millions die we'll clear! Herd immunity ftw! Surely death rate skyrocket hospitals become overcrowded. Plus, bad could economy millions workers sick productivity plummets across board? fucked everywhere.

Except China.  Rent free oh jesus - hope not.

that's gotta deal every 6 months..

...and there's still going people never got it, get vax.. (18 mos now). year now.. least CA.. letters still go out, mean something minority.

&amp;#x200B;

(and law could make happen little sooner). wonder people would react number deaths instead. Ok good :) Source? think cross border infections play huge role. Let's take Munich Frankfurt region, away border, high number cases. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern long border Poland, lowest number infections districts, although Poland infections (by number total) e.g. Netherlands. infections community spread. came Vaginal Steam Spa, stayed tried determine first, would willing let steam testicles. Second, denied ability steam testicles would considered form discrimination?

I think may overthinking this. Idk man, look Europe. (the US) suck, spikes clearly happening everywhere. People could put long. another hemisphere could look information making assumption... think one lack understanding science. one said mask prevent getting covid. help lower chance spread someone else infected. I'm going waste anymore time get point never will, probably end getting someone love sick. sad distressing. country messed big time. months prep! Im middle town TN close walmart 2 days 40 workers getting infected Covid. beleive Yep, tracks. Zillenial here, cry daily gone around apartment trying guess resilient certain parts apartment would suddenly support weight adult human really bad days. really, really shit. Dang, everyone US already infected one point? bother I'm asymptomatic? line expose people infected find I'm infected? There's nothing really done asymptomatic carrier. I'm quarantining putting work two weeks I'm even sickly. Herd immunity effect whether people choose not. Yeah, live Korea remember going stages idiocy (""it's flu etc."", ""I'll reschedule meet-up late March, we'll fine then"") taking seriously start March watching news slack-jawed horror country country country refused basic things Korea already done February even January. \*rolls eyes\* We're still technically that. Flatten curve means keeping healthcare system getting overwhelmed, technically happened yet, though elective surgeries might cancelled. also pointed reproduction rate can't stay 1 long matter goal is, virus deadly contagious this.

So, whether simply keep things hospital capacity, keep cases low baseline, attempt extinguish community transmission health authorities politicians. Opinions seem vary. want cases possible ... dunno. company moved unexpectedly first week march put hotel worked house hunted. second week got note saying would room cleaning, leave trash outside door left four rolls toilet paper sitting counter.

Ended damn hotel six weeks. anyone Norway here? wonder thoughts. also - still mask mandate NO? feel free share DuRr 99 pERcEnT sUrvIVaL raTe would seem open whole bunch maybes

That’s science about! Fine researching “mating process fruit flies” little bit complex it’s human beings world different cultures, diets, socio-economic states, genetic makeup, varying clinical backgrounds on.

Edit: spelling Hell, Trump already accusing Biden nation wide mask mandate lol find strange cases declining pretty steadily April May suddenly second wave control growth end June July.

I wonder might caused that? odd cant think anything might caused this. Must idiots dont wear masks right? Clearly must caused massive surge new cases directly following country wide protests Wtf R/hailcorporate bullshit sub. J&amp;J done plenty scummy things dear god don’t point things out. much winning. We're beating rest planet infection rates. know know much immunity either, positive negative. 

From personal experience, say traveling Bergamo Brescia area see people careful province Varese, wave 1 kind spared mayhem. 

The differences infection rates (cases x 100 000 past 2 weeks) drastically different, bit beyond simply carefulness could explain.

Bergamo 80 Varese 310. 

Brescia Cremona (second third hardest hit W1) also bottom list 113 165. 

Como Monza (least hit together Varese W1) stand 283 427.

Milano city league 550 (very high density) rest Milano province 455.

I'm making inference definitely wait see. would dare inference opposite either allocate ""carefulness"" sake argument. Apparently, people getting “pandemic fatigue.” So, experts saying even careful people recently slacking social distancing mask usage - particularly around “circle.” Keep mind it’s also getting closer holidays.  Good. people subreddit would support lockdowns even still going 2030. 

Please understand case everybody. Nobody idea vitamin important humans. there's gotta reason, right?

Most people die ""insufficient"" vitamin d. Happy 7 month anniversary flattening curve.

We tried, America.

Donald Trump failed state? Even rise cases PA, seeing huge spike hospitalizations. decent number coming ED numbers still 40 system wide (4 hospitals). 

At one point May June hospital alone 110. According times website starts counting, hit 85k new cases today. can't upvote comment enough. It’s obvious we’re headed. venture couple stores evening supplies 75% shoppers didn’t masks on, despite signs doors required. Earlier week last week closer 90% wearing them.  might be. bought 8' PVC pipe send candy I'm going wear PPE make thing. open bags candy go, send pipe instead dumping bowl contaminated me.

People really mad can't things want, break rules.

All need sometimes creative flexible still good time. PVC pipe cost like $7. I'll need dress warm. gonna happen! never flattened curve? right around time started checking daily . don’t check daily anymore though trust people anything. work supermarket half people come either wear mask wear chin/under nose.

Yesterday saw guy middle aisle pull mask sneeze. Kablooey open. I'm even allowed say anything! report management get labeled troublemaker

This kind ignorance we're dealing with. People fucking morons.

Not everyone. enough make sure shit gonna problem long looong time

Until vaccine devoloped wait intelligence people figure one out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *Sick, winning links dead me. Wild speculation, Trump’s maskless rallies probably contributing. Maybe instead constantly asking public make sacrifices..which increasingly unlikely do...they asking Federal Government comprehensive rapid testing system large scale financial relief.

Instead of...you know wagging finger people friends family over. (Just someone reading, I’ve provided information agreed guy I’m replying, also said “the government went full ret*rd” comment removed). Vitamin deficiency associated worse outcomes COVID-19 cases. Fall weather shorter days common cause deficiency. Dr. Campbell numerous videos subject. Here's one get started. say it, ""American't"" American. Yupppp. back day people though crazy telling buy extra cans food every trip grocery store. Honestly, probably one scariest, stressful times literally one anything, stuff seeing Weebo fucking awful Can't blanket country comments show different areas affected differently. Nevertheless people need realize what's going on. still sending young missions? Going door door? started following started seeing dozens videos social media people passing out/or dying streets Wuhan neighboring towns/cities. late December / early January.

I remember jokingly showing videos co-workers first confirmed case. Never expecting get bad states. brilliant!  I've jokingly referring pre covid olden days. February feels far away now
Edited word shut church.
They shut home visits.
They encouraged members wear masks, social distance, normal stuff conference local levels.
If live Utah, even need mentioned patently obvious. Well did... expectation hospitals would prepare inevitably went up. changed goal afterward.

Also, intense clearly defined spike after/during month half protests “didn’t spread virus”? forgot people pollution controls cars factories. cost little end consumer. thats clearly true. number ppl end intensive care infection tiny fraction compared overall infection rate.

the number ppl missing vital cancer disease treaments lock far concern Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's... going dark winter indeed.  well considering potus got fine i'd say covid crisis america solved. gives shit 1000 deaths day, Donald fine. cheer up. /s never got sick, everything says lies.  enough money problem. Congress passed $2 Trillion dollar bailout bill. that, $25 billion allocated testing, $3 billion spent executive branch.

So enormous COVID appropriation, approximately 0.1% money went testing, actually helps solve virus problem instead temporarily mitigating economic effects.

Supposedly new stimulus they're trying pass held partially Democrats want spend $75 billion, 4% total outlay, testing, Republicans opposed.

The problem government enough money massive testing, refuses it. reason simple, Trump said over. ""If test more, get cases."" wording tell research scientific way. cold isn’t bad wind starts mean realistically going front line workers getting first set vaccines keep things work, we're looking 15-25% population first batches doubt sooner December likely early next year.

Factor people wanting get it, number keep select safe really slow spread certainly enough get percentages talking about.

We're going fight Spring kind acceleration growth, we're going world hurt get vaccine even little available. globe lives north. We're used seeing flat maps, check NA northern EU globe, we're damn near north pole. making claim, significant portion people 50 (i.e., say 2%) either die suffer significant lasting health effects. disease around full year studied extensively anything else history. claim correct evidence support it. Please point said evidence. shut fuck up. Lots evidence Vitamin D3 level closely tied outcome catch COVID-19. research K2 MK7. recently discovered help me. trying put I'll shortchange explanation give you. worth time, trust me. much believe american exceptionalism comes kinds things, we're also seeing record numbers throughout europe areas well. truly heading dark holiday season. I'd rather take Prozac potentially lose functionality testes 🤷🏻. Becoming sterile, losing testosterone production, permanently decreased sex drive sounds like terrible future testes ACE2 receptors exploited. also realize never going able test positive cases. numbers always much higher. Yup. Watch documentary Prime “Totally Control”

Does good play play insanity we’ve living Yup. young there's 60-70% chance asymptomatic cold-like symptoms.

If one unlucky ones though (top percent), life-changing.

One neighbors hospital it. 13 year-old son? Completely asymptomatic. Yeah, rounding corner falling cliff. Yeah point idiots follow safety standards using best judgement. Expert well advised leaders great really gotta something idiocy ground

I get confusion early well this, everybody able use head make safe decisions don’t care understanding ""maskhole"" no-fly list maintained individual airlines separate TSA's ""terrorist"" no-fly list. agree merged. You’re taking unrelated case trying apply another. Marching jumping seat. Stop equating movement activity cant ways: either protests dumb decision lead 100k deaths perfectly fine open back up

What fucking stupid take basis reality. things nuanced black white like try paint as. do. mostly living western southern Africa then. always colder ancestors said, game like was. ever like that? fewer fewer us. set northeast towards flat salt sea... try mimick feeling getting vaccine, saline nothing.

That's fucking incorrect stupid, holy shit upvotes people agreeing you??

The purpose vaccine vs. Placebo 1) obviously see works 2) determine side-effects.

If people generally getting chills fevers placebo not, know vaccine cause side effect.

But placebo side effects too, there's way conclusively say they're coming experimental vaccine. Like know understand that?

Read little future. course are. ones strange symptoms? question.... know.  listened scientists, medical professionals, crazy politicians. look Victoria able achieve, 700+ cases single digit cases, close open safely Yesterday ""only"" 77k. We're world hurt. It’s bit late then,love.  fine different cut times counts. Worldometers highest day ever 79k today hit 81k. Unmitigated disaster states right now. Depends live could house heating system. live we've dipping 30s lately heater time, drying air gets nose throat irritated. try humidifier cold. Time relative now. Saturday Wednesday time humans far impatient

Americans

&amp;#x200B;

Americans impatient. Let's throw world it. EU makes statement debatable Yeah it'll go away burns fucking population... person knew 100% covid gave piece candy touched bare hands would eat it? Would knock door idea they’ll answer wearing mask? go 100 houses guaranteed happen multiple times. It’s super risky thing, it’s easy one avoid. point you’ll either die won’t

But you’re going die. get really sick, you’re going take ICU bed. One less bed save people didn’t decide saving lives inconvenient them. like deciding wear mask: choice make doesn’t affect you, choice shouldn’t make.

They dangerous selfish. 2020... 1920, 1420 even 1120.   boggles mind pandemic basically escalated control.  

my old high school history teacher used say someone died, end world him/her.  well, 1 million people around world, including 200,000+ Americans, literally end world them.  sad... :( First fuck cares old people dying 

Because old people die. That's do. Yellow Fever travel several destinations Ugh. happens there's federal leadership lay basic guidelines. Sorry hear that. spiking well. People parties again. Shits crazy. Yeah true, 65+ elders kids 10 excluded people option get tested undergo strict personal lockdown quarrantine. federal state governments incredible amount power comes Health infectious refused exercise power part federal level, exists extensive legal precedent forced quarantine. power challenged upheld many times throughout history, state quarantine Moore v Draper 1956.

If federal government power sequester people homes prevent communicable disease, way couldn’t get mask mandate. Now, might something needs legislation couldn’t done executive order. legislation it? Absolutely. 

Of course legal stuff nothing ever certain, there’s lot precedent this. starting mine well. Finally admitted enough enough felt good! Yes. plan. Sturgis exactly outdoor gathering. ever go 1mph speed limit. families friends MILLIONS dead Americans need read shit like that. That's cold, heartless really fucking sad. scientifically illiterate woke /r/nonewnormal suggesting illness weaker exposure less

Yes. That's young medical personnel dying age 30. got huge viral load tons patients. Hell, fall kicking ass already. Oof. Hate say doesn’t look great Europe either, especially Eastern Europe. went alone rising numbers. past two weeks, 42 states seen hospitalizations increase 5%, according Covid Tracking Project.
Ten states recorded highest number Covid-19 hospitalizations Tuesday: Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia Wisconsin, according researchers. friend pharmacist. visited recently (distanced outside) really rough time. Many people coming flu shots needs tell people wear mask argue day long.

This virus going away least months taking toll everyone medical professionals especially. mean whenever weather permits course. Every bit increased ventilation helps whenever there's opportunity, even intermittently. winter definitely seems least conducive season Agreed Nobody cares anymore. Coronavirus old news. Antibodies last longer person infected. abs RBD early February research purposes could detect whether person previously infected things started kicking located. say Black Friday

If think stupids spreading wait everyone neighbourhood fighting last TV.

Could cancelled safety reasons? Yes

Will greedy dollar wh0res that? Cases continue rise, governor opened everything back pretty much 100% capacity, mask mandate extended 11/14 🤦🏼‍♀️ case count popular anti mask crowd see exclusively country 

Weird rates exploding almost every country Europe US magical unique problem. Almost like “OMG US bad” social media narrative reflective reality. think small minority China practising TCM measure extent population ""believes science""?

If making things didn’t say don’t think way engage, that’s you. think twice u make another snarky comment. genuinely worth wasting time on. lots free time.

Can’t bothered type full words out...threatens people internet...brags much free time have...*definitely* teenager. 

Should obvious lol, gave way much benefit doubt. people believing science governing goes hand hand stop spread. 

I’ll ask again: Europe’s rates exploding across board COVID reflection “US bad heh heh”? Germany full stupid people? France? Italy? Spain? Czech Republic? Ireland? 

When you’re teenager anymore, you’ll realize scientists/epidemiologists politicians actually make decisions (or US’ case, ignore expert advice act like morons start pandemic). You’ll also realize world isn’t black white, can’t divide every single thing neat “bad” “good” boxes. Every country people want right thing, every country people don’t take things seriously should. mean ""official""? faking it? Every single state faking it? inside states, every county faking it? state publish numbers too? use calculator then. tracks health department Chicago told residents last week. Essentially version ""For Love God, stop inviting friends house, brain donors!"". Apparently majority recent cases traced back friend infected source contagion. 🤦 time ventilator

In surviving deceased cases? live Hong Kong whole city freaked shut little 100 cases day. waves way Google.

And nearly 300,000 now. Okay, technically yes, wrong. 

Except Im not? small single mutation feb 9 months since 200k deaths god knows many infections hasnt mutated again?

By continuing push idea virus *will* mutate again, though we've shown evidence say wont article literally lijnked says mutations observed **since feb**, youre fearmongering.

So. virus mutate? Yes.

When virus mutate? Last mutation Feb.

Has virus mutated since? way changes current replication, transmission evasion.

Should worried virus mutating? No.

Should worried contracting COVID twice? - Key line **Until know more, Poland says possibility getting COVID-19 twice shouldn’t make anyone worry.**

Ill edit post reflects new information. hate “we want make choice ourselves” argument 

That’s fine dandy, except 99% still won’t wear it’s voluntary 

Mask mandates shouldn’t necessary. enough experts advise use.

But alas, didn’t exactly work country monopoly stupid people. America leaning live tho I'm sure lot people virus earlier never tested cause symptoms mild...we're lot testing yeah cases watching someone Facebook. went like this:

I know anyone it. you?

OK someone knew it, know anyone personally it.

Someone know recovered.

Oh no! whole .00001% population died! HOAX!

Someone know died.

Someone family it.

My wife it.

My wife dead.

STILL HOAX! “Yeah, girlfriend goes *other* high school” Sane people rarity around here. simplest way get normal opinions look downvoted triggered simps libtards.  People wearing neckgaiters also added list, offer zero protection well. American America, attest garbage lot food here. horrified country first case. teachers like china need worry all. Save protect much can, fuck stupid employers bosses. Woah  would ever thought virus family causes common cold, would well cold. first months. rate dropped 0.2% killing people rate. imagine thinking entire world hoax conspiracy bring Trump yeah that's one.  Nah. us smart enough cancel engagements. 

I literally never get 3 trick treaters year. I'm gonna leave tiny gift bags handful snack size candy inside stairway leading house. kids rest candy, movie marathon caramel popcorn living room. 

Is perfect? No. suck? Yes. better us dying dumb holiday? betcha. USA! U..S....sick shit. Stop breaking records, America. Go shop around therapist gets hard so. too! started kind jokey me, say irony whatsoever. Get ready: number going every day next weeks. People around told Europe spike USA necessarily going one too. Yet, USA solved none political administrative problems caused many cases summer, therefore comes spike. Best get used homeboy. feeling we're getting started. opposite. Australia people think hoax. fundamental problem people government belong government. South Korea performed early widespread rapid testing; perhaps importantly automated contact tracing. united states, still using teams people calling positive cases phone, snail mailing letters contacts. 

In United States, charismatic president admired deeply cult following. president gets front people tells big deal, going away, worry it, media coverage democrat hoax, saved million lives cutting flights china, Dr. Fauci disaster, etc... people actually believe act accordingly. go lives taking seriously, spreading virus. 


South Korea 457 deaths date experienced least economic damage country world, despite one population dense countries world. 


Strong leaders would used brain, realized can't strong economy unmitigated COVID spread, heavily advocated use tech squash this. strong leaders, fractured weak government. United stand, divided fall. Whoever programmed dipshit. Same. eating lunch restaurant! friends! masks! Feels like least couple years ago.  3 % end dead thats 2500 dead weeks. many died 9/11 ?? Indeed, temporary surge hospitals dismantled nurses doctors laid summer. definitely empathize public health officials, I'd also ask we've done improve treatment capacity prepare inevitable surge we're seeing now. Here's link source study UK's Environmental Modeling Group role poor ventilation aerosol admitted down-playing said bad really bad still believe it.  It’s gonna go away like miracle Put perspective, could easily prevent whole fucking Hiroshima-like toll  wearing god damn mask..How difficult could ? Democrats That's exactly thoughts. feel like going anti mask protest soon. mean US? I’m Australia I’m privy around wave you’re moment We're #1!!! Fuelled midwest states enforce masks social distancing. best testing, ask anyone. thank much support, needed read ! would help Trump stopped saying ""it's going away."" wind blows neighbours coughs sneezes house?

They've already found covid particles travel 2k source light breeze, someone walking past windows coughing could easily enter home.

Keeping everything shut seems like best idea, would willingly waste heating risk getting cold pandemic? 

I know load people who's windows open onto pavement that's always busy. seems like terrible advice. point longer capable spreading virus. Ask boss they're comfortable with. homies hate States Oof, must suck live countries like USA Netherlands sound like governments witholding information. Italy every single day numbers published.  technically yes, virus ""mutated"". 
 
Okay, technically yes, wrong. matters, would think obvious factually correct important. difference 'there zero mutations' 'there zero mutations effect severity virus.'   
 
lol fearmongering. pointed incorrect. That's it. 
 
Also disagree new assessment impact mutations significant. would say mutation allows virus easily transmit person person certainly significant certain respects. Yea mean worked 13 hour shift manual labor ups surgical mask covering mouth nose removed away others drink water Crossborder west.

Frankfurt financial hub. dining 1 week ago restaurants took rules far seriously hometown multiple new cases.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern rural area.

And regions around Munich local autumn events even smaller scale. small scale kermesses country. neither nonfood food stands still amusement rides.

The main problem politicans want create rescue packets service sectors long run to. Ignorance put pedestal glorified past couple decades country (United States). readily identifiable rise ""reality television"". Couple social media; ability voice (and gain traction) absurd ideas - relative 21st century - formula primed combustion. pandemic catalyst necessary ignition.

You reap sow, unfortunately. thought interesting take psychology masks social distancing supporting prepper brethren calling liberals poorly copying practice long conservative history, mainstream conservatives thrown us bus claimed masks liberals saying masks don’t work virus flu back February. Now, mainstream conservatives copying liberal talking points February backstabbing preppers stuck conservative reverse positions happen?! lockdown horrible response COVID-19 pandemic, unlikely decrease number cases. effective response level. terrible second-order effects distorting perceptions risk masks social distancing natural conservative instincts, lumped together lockdown, conservatives started revolt indiscriminately measures related But, .. hoax! friends America busy enjoying life (a.k.a, endangering others' lives) like ""I ability shut fuck that's good idea."" Lots folks work here. Hungry. Tired rules. easy sit back comfort home. Yep. Leaving stuff car days, washing go sink, sanitizing removing everything else outer packaging.

There's simple calculation produces (very) conservative death estimate I've running since May.

Take current active cases region, country, whatever, multiply overall fatality % concluded cases.

Add total number deaths region.

This produces estimate current deaths + estimate many die current cases. 

This creates estimate predicted total current cases concluded new cases added all. meant conservative. expect numbers larger.

With said, numbers US yesterday. 

228,276 deaths + 
2,777,671 active cases * 4% = 
228,276 + 111,107 = **339,383** expected deaths.

#**339,383** expected deaths.

If additional cases.

And today added **81,210** more.

Remember death prediction expecting new cases, ***just*** expected total deaths current fatalities active cases already have.

Holy shit. That. Trump's arrogance gets us.

Repeating calculation new numbers give us this.

229,284 deaths + 
2,819,508 active cases * 4% = 
229,284 + 112,780 = **342,064** expected deaths. 

#**342,064** expected deaths. 

That's **2,681** deaths one day new cases.

Remember purpose calculation provide conservative estimate total amount deaths. Take number consideration realize **6x number US soldiers lost entire Vietnam War**.

Think every time Trump smirks says ""it's going away, rounded corner."" 

Realize every day continues, many thousands people going add death count. 

Every day wear masks, every day infection count rises, every day pretend ""turning corner"", run calculation see look forward to. 

Source figures: 
Total projected deaths = current deaths + (overall death% * # active cases) Lol possibly getting info? China obviously started saying 0 cases like 30 days thing. numbers pure fabrication Oh snap. never said year. Maybe 2021 thought meant Easter 2020.

Im country good governance, one HIGHEST DENSITIES people world also global financial hub. could go school face face basically whatever want. thats cause people actually use brains listen governments instructions. dont see happening anywhere west. yes, US others EU still rising cases pretty fucking stupid people. 

And im solely blaming whole population, ofc external factors surely, awhile lockdowns internstional travel really blame? High density cities/country mine curb spread west?

Guess what?? makes want go even *less*, thanks making decision final me. Honestly, Republicans Democrats framed wearing masks patriotic duty things would different. Trump administration fucked up. Anti-maskers least circles Republicans. 

I think disagreeing Trump message. personally know people voted Trump wear masks voting anyone Trump.

We need united government consistent message parties putting politics aside focusing virus. However, think happen anytime soon. feel normal shit came back positive tho idk us. terrifying time British.

We've lost something times sometimes mental health slips past daily case death counter.

TD;DR: Frustrated Man, last time got see grandpa person nursing home. RIP Kobe. main difference US rushed shutdown early whereas Europe virtually eradicate virus couple months, US multiple peaks one wave.

There's cost lockdowns too. lost wages, ruined livelihoods, lost opportunities. We've 3 million kids US formal education since lockdowns began: likely forever behind.

The Winter Death still associated Trump either way... Ah, educated states best. would’ve thought? believe admitted Oval Office round, well. image stress unreal, let alone KNOWING preventable people would listen trying damndest help yet still refuse. :-( Besides title tge article doesnt even attempt explain might 'super-spreader'. even says isolated pretty much hotel room. data stats contacts NZ testing positive. Another bad headline. skirting around actual point think covid still big problem there, I’m saying based first hand accounts people know living there. evidence support claim another racist, uneducated American who’s never left ever leave state let alone country? Sounds like something Trump would say rationalize We're gonna die! That's why! Buy ticket, take ride. lot people tired covid-19; want social distance, wear masks, wash hands isolate.  I'm native speaker expat neighbors, I'm sure I'd totally anonymous... ~~China~~ America Number 1! lump Europe together 200,000 cases day. Atleast try make population you’re drawing comparable kill around 1000-1500 people. That's actual death rate.  COVID causes job losses. Lockdowns play role too, moreso formalize people would anyways. lockdowns successful get back work quicker. Chance new infection minimalized. total lockdown. go work, shop doctor. course, still chance infection.  add u/fromscratch404's comment, younger people getting infected tested spring. Back people going hospital tested. symptoms need medical help act covid stay home, tested.

The worrying thing right infections seems reaching higher age groups well. really old seems still somewhat spared moment, numbers going likely case future.

Hopefully get top spread soon, virus reach old again. would also great reduce spread even younger people, risk dying lower still suffer long time effects virus. Stopping spread would benefit all. go foreign journalist report see. 

Nope. Depends you’re reporting want write. don’t counterpoint said

The counterpoint is: propaganda hell drug. google come back opinion don’t look silly

One annoying things ignorant people don’t even know enough understand misplaced arrogance is.  Money hope. Oof. can't. hope.  differnece reproduction value R0? 1.49 high. Yeah 75 families. think making point. EU cannot restrict interstate travel, fact, EU enough power force members keep freedom movement like federal US government can, member states independently decide close borders.

The state Ohio cannot come forward say ""we're closing border"" federal government allow it, France can, EU little it. France soverign nation, Ohio isn't. High five! Super duper untrue. Yes.

And approach fighting pandemic approach fighting war. Federal government leads pull together even hate others' guts. testing symptoms done many latin south american countries low testing capacity. money come from, pay people stay home? get stimulus package one payment?

The reason pleading residents government residents damn problem. seem think whatever like, whenever, Govt work magic fix problem. country can't even afford free health care system, yet think make regular income every resident appear thin air. Stay home can. Wear mask. Focus health. rocket science.

Your Government focusing macro details, improve economy.

We're numba One! 

🥇 COVID Champion!

/s Lmao ok? point? always come new infections test. Yes. incredibly easy make numbers fudge them. even admitted counting deaths people COVID COVID deaths. heart attack test positive COVID die, died COVID. paints much different picture, that's assuming numbers even correct. dubious numbers definitely floating around.

Also people dumb enough believe China drastically cut numbers clearly stopped reporting them, leading U.S. actually stupidly point fact they're worse China (China must laughing asses that).

It's comical people hard time believing things like Trump's doctors say something people Trump admin say something accept number thrown state federal government, even China. Like said, I'm sure claimed 1 billion got coronavirus day, people like would instantly accept it. 99.8%. Let *that* sink in. Digging graves die virus, done Indonesia. simultaneously true Trump failed miserably (he did) way calculating fatality rate misleading. fact severe cases likely get tested, people light symptoms often get tested. math take account. Biggest one-day increase *so far*... Yes, that's exactly mean though. EU enough power prevent members closing borders, federal US government constitution. EU, every country (as border closures seizing medical equipment previously destined export demonstrated back march) Lol, oh man. almost think believe that. Ah pity someone one countries (Australia: 6 8 states completely Covid free ~5 daily cases remainder), stuck US right now. Yes think country collectively nuts.

The virus isn’t magical. can’t survive isn’t physically able transfer one person another. everyone stay away everyone weeks. It’s rocket science.


The problem see US government (the entire structure it, Federal State levels) basically useless large scale action. seems entirely designed make anything decisive, making major reforms, basically impossible. healthcare mess, US tax code 20x complicated comparable countries, even simple things like abolishing penny switching metric system apparently “too hard”, on. Except time, real consequences inability actually something.

The virus doesn’t care usual excuses. patchwork local laws regulations nothing next county state isn’t thing. unified national approach absolutely required. (See also: gun control - essentially useless local level drive 50 miles road jurisdiction different laws) totally convinced non-surgical masks effective, either,

It great multiplying effect.

If mask 20% effective (80% transmission) wear none: reduce risk 20% [1.0 - (0.8*1.0) = 0.2]

If mask 20% effective (80% transmission) mask same: reduce risk 36% [1.0 - (0.8*0.8) = 0.36]

If masks 50% effective (50% transmission): [1.0 - (0.5*0.5) = 0.75] reduce risk 75%!

Even imperfect masks help lot. stop breathing prevent spread. future people trying warn SD Sturgis. frustrating. ancedotes reddit washington, brazil etc investigation past week, BNO tracker? hope long lasting majority. Ironically richest countries Europe want lockdown. Jeez moron. hope russian troll US citizen many? Last checked 27 million canadians?  Guh I'm Mankato like hearing this. Death lag seems sometimes take little longer 2 weeks. lag real, look #'s. Holy moley Jesus going highschool Seattle 1200 students 9-12. class like sold concert bodies moving halls. Shit would shut week tops. India going ? California different from, say, Georgia. Georgia people large wearing masks public never mask mandate besides big cities. California basically Europe better weather. Remember India halted exports PPE? still one US seemed concerned? absolutely clue talking science. makes zero difference many cells virus infects evolve 4 new inserts genome match 4 sequences completely unrelated virus especially 4 sequences combine physical sense create binding site spike protein top that, completely unrelated virus 4 sequences matched things, human pandemic virus highly controversial origin, HIV-1, complete utter moron would even entertain idea happened naturally chance. absolutely beyond statistically impossible. main part, 1.4 billion per lost school day, total, expected reduction life income missing education. learn less, also, average, earn less money working life, simple assumption.

I familiar research methods. research frankly sounds... stupid. impossible calculate. Perhaps children catch up; perhaps Norway still decide pay workforce 20 years - even workforce lost year in-person learning... researchers started assumption easy ""calculate"" confirm hypothesis. 56 55 (me wife, married 28 years). Firstly, know people don’t wear properly. really don’t push proper mask wearing least bit. Medical students take classes wear masks. taught wash hands putting on. taught dispose mask wearing. I’d say less 1% follow protocol public. 

Secondly, high rates mask wearing Europe experiencing another explosion cases. low rates mask wearing Northern Europe cases spiking way. 

As far droplets flying supermarkets concerned, doesn’t seem spreads. Prolonged exposure breathing air confined space seems likely. one family member gets it, family gets it. WalMart place passed, masks masks. 

There random controlled tests demonstrating masks prevent spread Covid-19. Danish study completed August. large sample randomized controlled study done. lead investigator Danish mask study, randomized trial see masks protect #COVID - asked would published. answer: “as soon journal brave enough.”

Of many RCT masks control flu, don’t show effective control spread. 

But masks touted “SCIENCE” isn’t much science justify virtue signaling connectors them. panacea like said. pitted Czech laughing ass off.

Everyone shit flaming up, matter measures restrictions. merely weeks behing us.

At least weve nice free summer. Would sacrificing worthy postponing crisis two weeks?

Nah, really Deaths lag cases wide margin. don’t get infected die instantly. heard ebola crisis going Africa, many international healthcare workers volunteered go younger age would leave completely broken.

If first big job life involves people constantly dying around you, maybe years experience develop emotional tools handle it, see would end disaster. everybody leave Czech Republic? worst Europe far Brolonoscopies I'm sorry term looking master's degree 4 years relevant experience. understand global pandemic humanity seen 100 years require best applicants. fact isn’t satire terrifying. We’ll back normal around spring it’s want keep living like this. clarify. Spring already, recovered. three weeks ago, re-exposed. get sick anything. Took temperature every day. Nada. friends get sick exposed glad they’ve recovered it. move life.

Wait see new UK research shows ""significant cognitive deficit"" recovered people, even mild CAN’T SECOND WAVE FIRST NEVER STOPS! RIDE WAVE BABY really interesting, thanks link. Quite contrast non-response US. love aww that‘s great hear it’s flu cold season..... sure different US UK testing is, UK combining flu cold numbers COVID numbers. I’m bullshitting, it’s governments website. Rise up, Italy! going advance argument literally third option, burden proof show options considered impossible

The burden proof actually person advancing argument prove true, everyone else prove false. I'll give pointers levying property taxes high value first homes

Even enough ""high value first homes"" matter, aren't, even luxury taxes *ever* worked raise meaningful revenue, haven't, still pass, assess collect tax time eliminating multitude tax credits currently offered builders

Tax credits eco-friendly construction renovations among effective anti-cyclical measures enacted Italy. Strip away crash sector, destroying tax base intend raise revenue cutting spending number areas

""Just cut spending bro"" plan. want us getting loans ECB

This exact ""the ECB print money pay subsidies"" argument called strawman last comment. Anyway, ECB can't ""give loans"" pay current expenditure, explicitly forbidden emergency QE

How think QE works, exactly? bond-buying programme ECB props financial system, put money state coffers could pay going euro altogether

Yes let's completely crash economy order liras pay unemployment. I'm really looking forward getting monthly £ 1.000.000.000 unemployment cheque buy half loaf bread (stale).

Yeah, called smart... sheep.. Ioannidis study done common cold. actuality quite amazing realizing that, tried double it. True. done pandemic phase , i.e. probably 2 years vaccine anti-viral would know true extent price paid.  


Anyway read Europe 230000 excess deaths summer. So, imagine India. Hopefully infected boss. States like NJ NY many things right warm months cases very, low. still seeing spikes now. mention countries started remained low seeing large increases. People predicting second wave even summer. May inevitable. quickly forgot happened months ago.

I question exactly would accomplish creat new cases. like gov say "" well okay, feel strongly, we'll cancel curfew make happy"". day 900 people Italy died one day felt like horrifying thing ever read. sound like duly, noted. thrown away don’t care want label anymore! happen India, think keep records everywhere, especially rural areas doesnt understand people upset losing freedom

&amp;#x200B;

What surprise /s saw someone refer ""the before-fore times"" ""the long long ago"" cracks haha think misunderstood ""2 weeks"" means case. mean spike new cases, rather two week delay spikes cases spikes deaths. pandemic subsided summer, death rate fell two weeks later. Hint. Jason means mask anecdotal experience mix. Older generation deal before, younger lack empathy sense responsibility. 

My mom definitely boomer. claims give shit dies. people making fuss going die anyway, can't get it. 

My older brother, hand, certainly self-centered, Gen X Boomer. He's come sorts conspiratorial reasons government trying shut private businesses.

We playing cynical game losing it. Oh okay, crazy person. Duly noted. missed cancer screenings, deaths sadly. mean, worked 100%. reason, central southern Europe thought ""ok covid over"" went back normal life.

Should've done Korea did. least ignorant world leaders guinea pigs. quarantine respective offices turn zombies. Don’t afraid, didn’t “do everything right”. Read follow post, kid transferring homes knows outside world.

Also, constantly less 6 feet apart? stay 6 feet apart people, ask step away must, keep distance yourself. data failed collect data. Whether collect data,in scenario, still exists. shared 2/3 days back. former coworker go it. got 2 tatoos went bar, got covid came home. realized it, attended concert current coworker thankfully catch it. also visited parents, infected nearly killed father.

It's bot quarantining gets 

""ill quarantine get back case""

goes fucking concert.... doesn't. restrictions, two months one infected hundreds thousands day Actually matter ND dies. huge amount food produced there. Go outside. one sick. isn’t. universities shut open regardless like public school districts. Roughly 60% US students currently distance learning right now. Even Trump Prez. blogger agenda yes. Also, detailed wrote English. 

Well includes first quarter every year... doesn’t compare first 9 months year average 9 months previous years. no, doesn’t explain anything.

Regarding EuroMono: also correct. true time.

Regarding rules: biggest independent economic blog Sweden author stellar reputation handling data accurately. said like said: agenda often sticks neck left right. it’s nobody. Either way; anyone easily go scb.se using google translate pick numbers themself - posting this. Clearly none paladins failed constitution saves... must missed memo said I'm supposed give shit people family friends. I'm tired eating I'm gonna die day anyway, I'm gonna eat food anymore Sweden “they” “we”. consistent use pronouns. might wanna leave one adults, looks like lot going head bud. you’re insensitive prick. don’t care comment gets removed. Yes actually. It’s becoming common. 🇺🇸. USA, USA, WOOOOH #1 I've heard officer say wear duty armed masked authority figure would stress public. wish would wear masks understand that, want arrested questioned someone who's identity even know He’s hedging bets Biden gets elected. guess people, that’s coming Crazy Joe gets in. mask moment step outside house. want shovel snow yard? Mask up. Want pick dog shit? Mask up. needs treated national emergency. imperative get control. Therefore, national guard deployed testing, enforce isolation positive cases, ensure enforcement mask usage local PDs. 

Just like required wear clothes public, national guard able issue citations local PDs refusal wear masks. 

If charged indecent exposure walking store without pants, frankly done people wear masks midst global pandemic already killed hundreds thousands people. Amazingly, still alive well. Ok, bilateral... That's pretty chatacteristic. Probably viral anyway. run flu trsts too, maybe look covid antibodies see comes up. Hope gets better Stop generalising saying “Swedes” “Sweden” weren’t 10 million individuals different views values. It’s pathetic childish. 

And post looks September, lousy representation 2020 whole. Slightly interesting one far saying Sweden great terms excess mortality. today died. Positive cases doubled 2 weeks, means deaths likely double another weeks nothing happens stop rapid growth they'll keep doubling best increase faster health services collapse. much emphasis deaths though - disease affect heart lungs months possibly life. Interesting. suspect varies location, impression outside rural areas masks nearly universal. RKI recommended half classes regions 50/100k/wk. Politicians ignore it, still believe fairy tale kids dont spread it.

Only good guy Söder locked Berchtesgaden told local politicians every Landkreis 200/100k/wk. Democrats mandated people wear shoes public GOP would refuse wear them.

All losers want benefit society none responsibility. I'm coughing sneezing wear mask? disagreement there. 'study':

""In summary, data one health system suggest Covid-19 remains serious disease high risk patients, outcomes may improving.""

May improving... said wearing mask late February, everyone city. already owned figured good idea. love calling bullshit! Keep beat misinformation war! Official Bad Place song? issue isn’t aren’t mandates. issue are, mandates aren’t enforced. Even police don’t abide mandates. many openly stated enforce. bigger problem, opinion. Argentina especially. way mandate worded mass option enforce it, stores employees required wear masks times required enforce customers happened Texas summer. people don’t care now, won’t ever care unless fucks personally. sounds much like Germany, still schools like normal, packed classrooms grade 5 don´t even need masks class. Brussels sprout again.

Ill show out. that’s best come you’re definitely getting hired don’t need worry Hubby hunting state Colorado.  Traveling one hunter one two people back porch visits occasion summer. 

They share camper, keep away hunters get together socially distanced around campfire. bars, motels etc.

These two old geezers also avid fisherman. banned annual fishing trip Wyoming spring managed still annual trip far Northern Minnesota June. 

Hubby's friend owns cabin there. packed food car drove straight 19hrs. cabin. Two Minnesota friends brought camp trailers stayed cabin property. 

Again interacted doors masks social distancing play..........all old men either medically compromised wives are. careful, cared etc. enjoyed good fishing trip. done.................you smart care. think anything else aside, anti-maskers conservative, would accept argument anything else.

There certainly difference way liberals conservatives see world. Though, us anti-maskers, incapable seeing hypocrisy comes up. 
The conservative types mention certainly exist. even still argue businesses allowed refuse service people color.

These exist too. like wish much would segregate Antarctica, wearing best summer attire. try make us feel bad criticizing killing people due choices.

I'm not. 
I simply stating ineffective. desire avoid guilt tripping insults, impossible reason anyone start conversation insult. That's reiterate: functional alternative masks staying home.

Ok, well then. incentivised? 

Thanks honest thoughtful reply, appreciated. Canada here. mask mandates every province (The fed's cannot mandate it). followed almost universally. numbers going up.

Don't fool thinking masks stop this. helpful, wear them, nothing makes go away time.  We're fucked winter, even competent politician nothing change that. see many. Daily. still report businesses weekly. seems reasonable things continue way are. Right 2.5% confirmed. next fall could 6% confirmed. Sometimes people multiply 10 rough estimate real number cases, 60%. reinfections truly rare, would good news herd immunity. sneaking suspicion actually rare; confirming difficult (requires sequencing something). Hopefully we'll good vaccine then. Stay healthy friend. included soda hot dog it. Good. cool thing Canada strip clubs Montreal anyway. Probably businesses enforce safe policies. Good. He's piece scum. He's extremely anti-LGBT anti refugee. mean, recall listening NPR one day claiming Cops enforcing mask policy NYC racist arrested black Karen one day. incident, stopped enforcing it. There's way works people fucking selfish.  Seconding this. job providing flu shots coworkers, pharmacies clinics got em too. Get shot! Why? already owned trip Tokyo last Fall they’re sold 7-11. seeing chatter news since health issues wearing mask didn’t harm anyone else, not? I'm confused all. Like said, Europe totally arbitrary area land. There's little common Norway Turkey, example. see reason lump together talking covid-19. appreciate perspective comment. took didn’t leave house ten days, everything shared custody arrangement, means he’s tethered parent’s choices pretty powerless. pretty powerless feeling. would criteria be? think employers want see internet history see educational videos watched YouTube?

C'mon, man. visiting US China around feb yeah definitely masked people already. China late Jan almost fully masked point. effective Czech Republic, stopped mandatory mask, highest numbers world. Hmmmm... it’s almost like less mask use results higher infection rates. Funny is. We've rounded corner. We're recovering now. past time reopen!  think national mask mandate happen **if** presidency changes hands. people blame Democratic Party refuse wear masks. become act political disobedience wear mask. take care care homes? visit doctors? places schools funded local taxes, meaning rich great schools 

also left, willing pay taxes understand value cooperation, get educated, right think taxes communism, basically go bible school learn nothing. link asthma COVID outcomes? don’t believe been—the opposite might actually true. Turning corner new world record might. taper days, drink half much day before.

Source: alcoholic, tried quitting, gone withdrawals. They’re fun. president mocked disabled reporter again? guys aren’t know critical thinking I’ll let pass Fraudci start learning weak mask properly I'm tired winning. pneumonia last year too. COPD. mandate nothing. 

What need responsible leadership.

By responsible mean fuck level respond justice system. [Fake ""COVID Marshals"" trying gain unauthorized access people's guys scared living US? unpredictable scary... agree. Based new facts knowledge, people amend prior statements. happened plagues, mandate make laws requiring anything? help? much winning already owned trip Tokyo last Fall health issues. initial reason mask, least, kept touching mouth nose. I’m healthcare, believed “no harm, foul” since owned them. cops would never enforce it. think make rules. 

That said, mask mandate would never deemed constitutional mean government can’t force wear accessories period, sad is.

During normal times would honor wear mask fellow countrymen long 45% country sipping autocratic kool -aid, it’s us vs we’re own. 

Thanksgiving come around thin herd dummies I’m sure Thats even remotely true. people wearing masks. see every day.. report businesses weekly.. 

And else spreading people gathering parties shit without wearing masks. OP troll. Please avoid directly responding him. make distinction: people died covid might necessarily ones otherwise would died. Overlaps obviously would steer clear possibility accused arguing “they would died anyway” Fair enough coming someone like then. Maybe whatever reason whole situation fact help reduce causes death Sweden year. wonder causes death reduced then. “Why not”. Holy hell, that’s unreal. I’m glad family small and... like that. Hanging much time around family lethal mental health everyone. excuse avoid welcome blessing.  LOL. late husband used accuse love Harrison. also archeologist uncle turned teaching, looks much like him. like Harrison. seems like family. Totally agree following guidelines states like Texas asking get infected. read article back March essentially said this,  order Americans personally impacted take seriously, million people would die COVID: 500,000 dead projected Feb are. got numbed out. Since it’s elected position, he’s enforcing electorate. many layers constituencies you’d need aligned mask mandate work. mother probably already covid beforehand, matter test said. bilateral pneumonia high density covid area, covid far probable anything else. Test worth shit first week symptoms. 25% false negatives. 

If tell also low linfocites, high ferritin Ddimer, need test Uh, ok Except I’m advocating exactly thing are... People Southern TX dying home medical care we're still stupid, there's hope us. say state's meager supply hospital beds filling capacity case rate highest ever been. hate many drank cool side Dr. Birx. massive outlet disinformation apologizes trump every step. selected Pence bc religious beliefs. 

Dr Birx id league Fauci. plenty blood hands needs fired ASAP. Surely blogger agenda. never seen write blogpost English this.

There lot ways cheat statistics. blogger includes example first quarter year sweden less deaths normal.

There lot things consider estimating excess deaths. Demography weather example EuroMomo specialized that. 

According EuroMomos baseline deaths Sweden 6504 excess deaths week 33 last week health authorities reported excess deaths. 5734 reported Covid deaths. numbers found table B2 Folkhalsomyndighetens weekly report week 35.

And moderators, blogpost nobodies allowed sub? Thanks Easter 2025 even remotely true. place unsourced speculation. Even today, skeptics complaining we're testing much, overreacting case spikes. They've calling reductions testing, believe not, disparagingly referring sorts resurgences ""case demics"".

Remember, however, opposite problem true. actually testing enough! That's many new outbreaks popping everywhere. vicious cycle everywhere (except places handling disease situation well, Australia South Korea): people ignore precautions, government agencies fail follow effective contact tracing (in spite whatever promises might made so), cases get control, governments may may tighten restrictions, skeptics use ""case demic"" pseudoscientific nonsense justify keeping everything open, finally—much skeptics' surprise, indeed—deaths get control along cases.

Don't fall trap complacency! know might *really* tempting right now, we're bored this. want go brunch, want go brunch. fight virus way through, enemy overpower us. Remember happened New Zealand? lost ""zero cases"" status, people returning normal! really done that, know? Think like antibiotics: stop taking doctor recommends you, infectious bacteria develop resistance antibiotics.

**Long story short: keep moving, stop.** law? states could order something like that. people staying home whole lives That’s keep hearing. :/ wouldn’t want get get with? envy America Europe right now. 

Being Melbourne, Australia - We're starting see results 100+ intense lockdown daily numbers averaging 5. Summer around corner too. We're looking good. 

To overseas. stubborn. Wear masks. Follow rules. long run, worth it. first? curve guy looking at, eh? Also fact US done covid tests like next 3 countries combined. course cases. kind shit always gets me... like, genuinely think America country entire world? legit concept things happening beyond borders? you’re going quote please include material pick one sentence series statements. wrote entirety you’re referring one source “Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital care”. that’s report systematic review literature that’s peer reviewed published biomedical journal.

Your high. Look countries good testing rates see 20% confirmed cases ending hospital

Please provide link(s) references back statement, “countries good testing rates see 20% confirmed cases ending hospital”. may well correct. state link provided report published study.

What “good testing”? Please provide citations.

And exactly “good testing” lead lower hospital rates? Please provide citations.

In addition, “good testing” merit everyone might access it.  I've gotten speeding ticket going 40 35. problem busting people something ""dangerous"" that. made offense come fines surely cops would try make money? doctor nurse there, would walking away job. would say parents know wouldn’t matter couldn’t trust brother truly stay quarantined 2 weeks beforehand. mention still go work 2 days week CARE don’t want expose anything may may carrying. Thoughts prayers ultra Christian, science denying bigot Thank - too!! trying! shocked days ago Ohio hit 2k day first time. won’t surprised 3k daily next week (especially football starting) thinking you. tough spot. "" testing well "" 

While second best countries 10 mil... 

Its pretty much comment anyone else testing definitely outside work, incredibly careful. may ask country from? I've plane twice life caught cold return flight. Planes bad cruise ships considering air partially recirculated. act like masks sort newfangled concept way work mystery? People wearing mask prevent spread infectious respiratory diseases hundred years. commenter child immune compromised really think want risk around possible outlier... old people getting it.

Economy, jobs livehood way important 70+ years old dying.

Then *they* stay home isolate. Oh sweet summer child... Ah'm givin' gubment mah info track me! /s  Korea checking here. firmly control, daily cases hovering around 100 so, really right. feel US particular lost collective mind fear seeing superpower wane. good thing, alternative much worse. 

I'm praying US makes next months without descending complete chaos, medical political. Europeans concerning well--especially UK--with whole Brexit thing happening top Covid situation.  big difference ravaging fine non-existence like Chinese government would tell you. Fake news election make Trump look bad. /s appears like going serious storms season.  glad they're running again. Meanwhile: Please get flu shots ASAP. discussion pointing increased immune response help acquiring COV19. realize half stadium worth people died heart disease world wide yesterday. 

We need global ban processed sugar, mandatory exercise programs, outlaw smoking.

Did know smoking cause permanent damage heart lungs family members friends around you?

It would crazy allow much recklessness leads directly stadium worth deaths daily! Jack Handey.  POTUS says going away? /s I'd ask graveyard shifts, stocking cleaning. Oklahoma? Yes, know. Netherlands was. dishing Belgium, even mention them. refering north general. fair Belgium actually worst hit country Europe looking excess deaths (Spain UK far worse). sure, approach success stretch imagination. cretin like could ever mind changed facts arguments sort. time takes write two sentences far deserve. Remember pandemic going Easter. said 40K - 60K deaths. 

Take care all. Please wear masks. Avoid indoor gatherings. little bit reduce spread. Time take seriously back March. hope get there. again, moved literally halfway 'round world, stopped harassing bullshit. Sure feel better, though. Spoken like true supporter authoritarian governments. Remember back Jan people saying situation get better / end warm weather arrives? Looks like going full circle Official US government policy covid 19: “It’s going disappear. One day, it’s like miracle, disappear” Turning corner right towards cliff. India probably like Africa, immunity corona viruses already. It'll recording breaking more. edgy brave This, time cash stocks market going down. backlash trump virus going hit hard. comparing causes deaths.
you need stop ppl hyperventilating fear yet American problem. 7-8-9

RIP 9 still make horrendous behaviour powder. People understandably trust ever that's perfectly OK. number studies suggest viral load (how much virus have) viral dose (jow much virus initially infects you) affect sick get. Masks help reducing viral dose blocking some/ cough etc hitting you. husband mad go Thanksgiving year. blood clotting disorder he's mad *me*... mad yet feel guilty want virus trigger blood disorder... See Stephen Miller example may misreading statement, read like think  report detailed setup monitor humoral immune response 300 COVID‐19 hospital patients healthcare workers, 2500 University staff 198 post‐COVID‐19 volunteers. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody responses follow classic pattern rapid increase within first three weeks symptoms. Although titres reduce subsequently, **the ability detect anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies remained robust confirmed neutralisation activity six months** large proportion previously virus‐positive screened subjects. 

 think mean detectable 6 months after. course it'll forever, widespread like now. Humanity fully eradicated couple diseases. Black plague still pops one shits covid likely go way seasonal flu.

But sure, stay miserable rest life. He’s stating obvious. I’ve saying since May. They'd receive care hospital died. We're afraid death point basically torture people bit life, somebody going die accept move on. death rate lags around 4 weeks, 4 weeks ago 1500 cases day around 6% given yesterdays death number, math see happens apply 20k people day. like there's shortage volunteers vaccine candidates, even early stages. top average Chinese person trust CCP average american US government. certainly happening little hospital right now. while. People get FB complain long wait ER get told ""that's way always been"" ""quit trying start drama"" Even actual nurses ER try correct get called liars.  Cyprus underreporting massively. Spain UK underreporting too. Belgium France seem best reporting deaths accurately among worst-hit countries, followed Sweden Italy. don’t endanger myself, I’m asshole? 
Bro everything shut right now. Again. fact malls, churches, banks, schools, restaurants bars running it’s bad shows we’re trying go back normal state function. Masks social distancing go far, evidenced literal skyrocket numbers. one installed office. cutting huge hole wall expensive part, get device around 300$.

It great air inside, first arrive, feels like window opened day. individuals still getting disease, think completely they're feeling better go infect people. think people finish antibiotics, time quarantine. Swede here. Another difference TTC Norway. occur Sweden probably great help keeping numbers long time. say luck probably large part Sweden probably cases circulating stray Norwegian shutdown really difference. primary benefit masks minimize spread virus already infected trapping coughs sneezes greatest extent possible. masks meant protect infected. 

Sure, want try protect virus need get N95 masks change daily often that. continuing shortage acceptable PPE makes difficult. sit around smoking weed something eventful happens never looking days future. can't wait till safe made giggle. Take poor man's gold, granny smith.

🏅🏅🏅🍏 never happen capital won’t allow it. imagine able sue employer careless grocery stores exposing you? Capital NEVER work us, wealthy would never allow it. American problem? Well least got control after, better countries anyway. pay see Tool concert. Maynard creep. news, province Europe reached critical threshhold 50 smth. Trump certainly make masks mandatory. don’t want upset certain followers think masks affront freedom. Lockdown brilliant loved every moment it. done wonders mental health. said American #1 at.  et tu brute? company like J&amp;J safe life asinine quite disturbing willingness fall knees sort ""normalcy"". opposed every medication water... Americans headed dark winter

johnsnow.jpg I'll brave stupid one admit i'm one people go pandemic. didnt initially first months lockdown us (me friends) tired home, go fun. mostly attend small maskless gatherings friends mostly miss other, including girlfriend too. still wear masks go still bring use lots rubbing alcohol, im gonna justify we're doing. Thankfully country's cases flat less 3k cases per day, still. Im gonna justify actions, wanted let out. many need die change things? Buckle bitches.... Taps head  Wait... pandemic -how president (or competent president least) able mandate mask wearing? really hate country right now. 0ver 83k new cases one day morons running country pretending pandemic over.

Now let's see ignore wiggle news story. Yes. People make political want, ultimately fault every single individual refuses take precautions. Yes be. becomes health issue idiots minds work. 40% nation thinks political. large portion law enforcement 40%. what?  mean terrorising innocent people?

I'm west I'm white European born living here. cops one worst following mask guidelines. one sheriff FL instructed deputies wear masks!! Moments hearing Idaho hospital overwhelmed COVID-19 patients looking sending people far away Seattle care, members regional health department board voted Thursday repeal local mask mandate.

Covid 19 laughs. listening podcast herd immunity US would require infecting enough people 2 6 million people die. biggest Asian success stories lock though. SK, Taiwan, Japan, none lockdowns, least Korea heaviest restrictions regional closures bars schools. great response pulled depths thread new post. would consistent didn’t wear masks.

Covid Act : South Dakota Positivity % graph European kinda like it... What's solved current half ass measures?

The economy shit. We're prisoners. Covid spreading more, less. 

So, need go one way other. Either free everyone let economy run normal accept outcome, actually take virus seriously enforce hyper strict regulations order truly fight it. Everyone age group talk real life isn’t afraid. Especially given number people see trying live lives. difference masks. talk people Reddit hand got young healthy parents young healthy kids still locked homes thinking they’re Cow moovid. cops enforce turn blinkers...... could end good them. US GDP fell 30%. don’t know China’s GDP now, know basically completely reopened months. economy started upwards recovery far ahead could become new biggest economy. Human Nature way, humans live variety ways. Predatory capitalism tends turn lots people assholes. much so, often de-program.

The solution drop rat race start figuring ways take care other. vertical count flat china ban!

/s may increase winter more. cautious. talking CFR, IFR, PFR? Seems like numbers quoting PFR We're end game now... Actually many older homes like mine (100 years) ventilated today's standards cold winter. Bigly Yuge rounding believe me! sure, I'd really interested see positive test rates time honestly. Feb-April essentially able tested unless knew coronavirus, always underlying knowledge ton people asymptomatic show low symptoms able know not. Read article somewhere county (or counties) Idaho many Covid cases hospital full patients sent Seattle, Portland, etc. I""m really fighting feeling really stupid hate people say COVID-19 stay nothing about. real issue people don’t want take precautions lazy. candy giver, always buy plastic baggies along candy.

Got ya. government mandate mask distance measures, want child go back school ? solved problem. broken government wont anything, one should! Brilliant. U.S.: 83k population 330m.

Nationwide remember reading 25% students able access remote learning, due number technical reasons (lack broadband) economic (lack equipment one household WFH). That's 25% 56M students US.

School districts hit nationwide another problem, students disappear, found since school year began. Trying find solid numbers even reporting difficult - local district reported 4% students never reported in. affects districts funding directly. grandma said doesnt care even virus, she'd rather 1 last good christmas family knowingly die hide away possibly die january virus age related complication. already are. acting like people wearing masks everywhere go?

However, don’t know one year measures.  I’m person responded to, that’s took comment. interpreted still engaging risky behavior. Engaging risky behavior doesn’t make bad person irresponsible, depending behavior is. working? Living someone works? shared custody? Etc. things increase risk, doesn’t mean shouldn’t them. means can’t say everything right quarantining. definition, quarantining. 

My cousin “did everything right,” someone lives didn’t entire household wound testing positive (this month ago they’re fine now). doesn’t mean masks don’t work. doesn’t mean can’t get takeout. doesn’t mean can’t go store. feel like laughing remark might make bad person We're catching up. We’re 224K deaths across two measurable peaks different regions country, strained hospitals right edge capacity. exactly skeptical time? Youtube comments absolute hell. Contact OSHA. EU control spring, hotspots got hammered, traced, isolated controlled... ""muh summer"" happened

And idiots ""had to"" travel like idiots shit place exchange viruses packed areas, brought back viral memories back home.

Now virus evenly spread like butter toast EU getting fu\*ed equally over. think stacked, like first wave second one US general government going pay heating bills? house old solid no-cavity walls suspended timber floors, already expensive heat using gas. Even without covid, hard kill family members third day visit... think actually feeling sadness fellow healthcare workers. doctor knows exactly going through. knows sounds people make dying respiratory distress. knows better us exactly what's come. Though I'm sure devastated hear daily deaths cases, someone asked hardest part is, mention hard knowing doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists would go again.

And feel like heard lot frustration voice too, communities listen science reason, instead, listen talk show hosts medical advice. Maybe sue bad tools lack training employees subs. worst time sub school teaching math. doesn’t know tech shows. Plus there’s ton BS taught younger levels times pointless. pamphlets take longer teach understand basic math. spend hours time trying learn lesson works rather actually math. say it’s better bet assume people get immunity getting Covid? statement friend doesn’t make sense nonsense. obituary section local paper always full 80 90 year olds dying, read get “sad” prior COVID, reason elect start caring now? Look ages article, it’s 70s, 80s, 90s. Human beings struggle comprehend impact, implications, phenomena produce terminal outcomes --let's call death, moment-- small shares populations causing harm -- death--for another small-ish fraction, recoverable sickness still-small, quite widespread minority. us ""get it"". another fraction need someone tell get it. 

A frighteningly large fraction actually need ""see &amp; feel it"" get it; many monkeys dancing around obelisk movie ***2001*** get value old bones tools saw one tribe beat another tribe's monkey death one.

C'mon, monkeys -- we're better this. Wisconsin admitted first patient field hospital Wisconsin State Fair Park, near Milwaukee, Wednesday, day state reported record 48 deaths novel coronavirus. field hospital, 530-bed facility opened last week, meant relieve pressure local hospitals, rapidly filling COVID-19 patients Wisconsin's outbreak worsens. areas, 90% ICU beds full, according governor's office.

Here comes folks. winter 2020/21 going killer. winter around, we'll see U.S breaking records. Fuck family making fun you. Honestly, stick faces hopes ingraining SORT empathy warped souls. even read STV program, approved Thai cabinet last month, tourists “low-risk” countries permitted enter Thailand long stays 270 days. long list conditions. **After arriving, visitors must stay government-approved quarantine hotel hospital 14 days.** required undergo pre-departure testing virus take special COVID-19 coverage issued Thai insurers. also need prove least half million baht ($16,000) savings. Shoot yea sarcasm lol. 2,000 people &lt;35years estimated 30-40million US infections. There’s plenty afraid that. Like said, someone concerned getting make choice avoid people times forget mention crack head 

But I’m fat crack head. wear mask everyone else don’t hate them, loath people lack tax  Texas first crisp night. Hard take holidays without festivities, gatherings, parties year... Trail Lights. carnival. thanksgiving forty people potluck. New Years parties.

I’m sure things like still happen but... I’m going sitting inside crying life. pandemic getting emotionally exhausting. want hug mom, man. mouse god bends knee every karen bitches service park complimentary shit.

Source: friends worked disney US really turning corner; minute now... someone explain get worse winter colds/flus get worse winter? I'm imagining families staying inside cold, thus staying away people, decreasing chance infected. we've seen many countries could start go back confident India staying downward trend long yet goes Brazil. son needs Covid test start work Monday. nowhere available test Tuesday. kid start job late. hell people need test symptoms? suspect 100M folks would get right offered let’s start skeptics wait 6 months sant ""Olympians hate him..."" us(upstate NY), literally right now. balmy 77 today early morning tomorrow 31.  Go live actual third world country month get back me.

We spoiled unbelievable. I'm tired seeing self defeating sentiment. Stop it. fortunate live lives do. Uhh huh. want organize 7 billion people infected disease once, wipes virus. think sounds unreasonable. implying another? will. agree saying. view though IFR .1-.6% requires different response IFR 5% like initially theorized.  America #1!

^/s Back January, American media outlets calling pandemic ""China's Chernobyl"" - like one: months later, USA almost recording many new daily cases China total. frightening sad Americans trying take seriously protect communities old people die flu eqch year rate. march news rate much higher. basically like weve watching OJ trial people afraid.  Yup think point rural communities aren’t listening. go back work person (presumably) go back school person immediantly increases contacts, it’s like people go straight work home repeat everyday. Fucking based, tankies cancer modern political discourse proceedings start around year ago, impeachment last December trial January February. Ugh sounds like boyfriend's family. seen family almost year assholes visit constantly going knows else act like I'm trying steal son told need wear masks want get close us. I'm epitome health, us one worry least complications. seriously check boxes. infuriating. think go 75 minutes sitting sofa playing Xbox without drink water happens dominant religion teaches ""free agency"" decades, bolstered political party emphasizes individualism collective responsibility. Propaganda Agreed.

But, people simply cannot reached. former friend perfect example. cannot reason someone known 40 years more, could possibly reach?

At point becomes hopeless, leave behind. sad is. mean, Graham Weston made money Rackspace, web hosting company known treating employees extremely well prime.

It’s like running bunch pay day loans understaffing paying people bare minimum directing apply food stamps.

I agree pay taxes, people blanket hate vilify billionaires, it’s bit absurd productive. two way different replies?

Is 0.6% according CDC 1.39 according study cited? Ironic you’re mentioning nature completely forget you’re saying could result natural selection. recall someone talking debate..... [Ivanka's kids speak mean minimal trolling tone intended 

If numbers levelling much USA, cases going much? telling shit like already know? think got first DLC title! Donald Trump surviving Covid-19 worst possible thing could happened. biggest issue comment 2.7% death rate. implies 2.7% people get Covid die. I’m saying estimate 1-.5% based scientific studies can’t simply say X people positive, people died that’s death rate like trying do. 


The rest it, could debate 12 hours straight. That’s endless public health debate. IFR/CFR objective measurement.  Italy horrifying images coming hospitals 85000 cases *total* whole country. rest lives? Nope. Even everyone wore hazmat suit, soon people stopped virus would grow would immune system. EVERYONE get point. point scared it.  mean, went interstate fair, wore mask, people kept bouncing me, used hand sanitizer still happened crisis mismanaged protocols place, hospitals able properly treat it. death rate average flu. 0.2%. heartless seems, thats reality. news talk many elderly people die regular flu year.

The outstanding thing survivability surfaces incubation time.

If hospitals overloaded like first month, yes would become immediate threat. EU significant control economic regulations. (However really use ways pandemic). Ditto.
Congratulations well done, you! M-m-m-multi kill USA USA USA India’s population low-risk cases fly radar testing low small amount cases get reported Yee. fuckin nailed one. trolling.  That's valid point, think people assume way, maybe start calling ""symptomatic mortality rate"" we're building herd immunity! America first!   Yeah, shocked 7 cases today too. relative guess. economy great??  Since informed “fear-mongering”? word..shitty. worst lasted almost month, days better others. Wake fever feeling like got ran truck overnight. would basically go away days come back again. still coughing fits time time can't say 100% lingering effect cuz smoke worry Canadians also join guys soon shitting bed. weird. Overnight went main information source reposts racist uncle  ...... actually interesting.

i read several medical cases people put strangest thing anal (which involves eel, light bulbs sorts).

but tennis ball vagina .... that's new one. Positivity rate 7%. undertesting. excerpt:

EDIT: word China also strictest lockdown likely country world. US none. [Here's Science news article fuckin' lead author MD.

TLDR; virus starts lungs hit hard first, moves organs seriously fuck up. Heart damage kidney failure well known complications. affect brain causing strokes seizures. 

It also affect organs like gut. People blood clots parts body brain. 

Bottom line: fucks up. USA USA USA USA USA  mean wrong probably much sooner win win win matter what! Beware Ides March..

Of wonders yet heard, seems strange men fear; Seeing death, necessary end, come come. Blows mind people believe horseshit Same, half ICU entirely covid patients now. bro realize totally failed controlling spread virus, right? single reputable scientist planet state Singapore New Zealand made virus disappear. one. That's different though, since ""waves"" epidemiology oscillating like physical waves. ok? Rounding corner. realize we've passed 200k yet, right? bot graphic going around comparing different pandemics deaths like 4,000. Im Alberta experience least half people masks. Restaurants ignore public distance etc. wonder europe anything stop it...
It's gonna go away own.
They're basically killing economy point. Cunt better word.  Cold, dry air also allows droplets evaporate faster. means virus particles end suspended air people exhale lot change 2 months many people tested per day time previous new case count set vs now? 

How many newly infected experiencing symptoms? 

This metric certainly alarming needs rounded additional info compare accurately severity current outbreak situation summer. Imagine going church worship savior literally preached going churches worship done vanity appearance. They're *supposed* stay home pray private they're truly faithful. need big building full staffers living money. People keep ""free media"" U.S countries back Feb-March, media downplayed Covid-19 due to...corporate interests (oligarchs). ever really ""free""? Free whatever want without government influence free backed unified corporate interests. Ah yes remember part constitution interstate highways. Speaking elections think early voting person also contributing covid cases? Cause honestly hundreds millions people voting voting polls could potentially cause many outbreaks That’s unique covid simpleton  Korean government showed immediate results. Unfortunately, us military dependents stationed Korea Korean local government made complaints USFK go around neighborhoods mandate it. There's still vulnerable people javent it. Yep. basically people selfish blisfully ignorant. Maybe lied effectiveness back March. lot blood hands malaysia hit 4 digit case 😔 constitutional right enforce people wear seat belts? see difference two Exactly. Huh? Source? love optimistic sub become least. Thy idea for. That’s see we're number one something again./s Ok, well then. incentivised?

By paying stay home. China largest exporter world, export make 20% GDP (compared 12% USA), even believed China counted controlling spread swiftly, seems like bad business try bankrupt customers. lot transparent matter US India least like Yo Unk, engineering degree means Dick medical world. Stay lane fool. die. Must bunch snowflake whimps downvoting you. Discipline critical thinking never hurt anyone pansy ass morons. That’s trump mess. Magical thinking religious superstitious everyone gets prize parents. Bunch self entitled fucks. people literally trying spread it, achieve herd immunity, go back eating out.

I mean literally believe covid. time stop labelling everything stupidity, pure malice degeneracy.

My take society literally decadent, decadent societies believe nothing matters, basically always fall faced challenge &lt;--- here.

Everyone better pray vaccines sent heaven, ADE side effects life threatening make pop level vaccine impossible. We've seen signs what's happening, too, people ignore it. Pelosi literally china town NYC telling people stop racist visit. around March.

Here also NYC’s mayor March 2nd. month Jeromes comments. yes, Positivity rate 24.6% 😳 free many places insurance. insurance covers county offers free testing well. people using they’re uninsured it’s convenient them. used mail test bc didn’t want bother scheduling waiting line free public testing site CVS. Right? Wonder like inside walls Rome Empire collapsed. MT also state kids move every 10 minutes don’t hit magic 15 minute rule. 

So doubt efficacy government enforcing something like mask mandate. corporate media. pinned Useful Resources here? 

The numbers used rough rounded. shows cases per 1mil pop example.  1mil / CasesPer1mil = 1 infected xyz. 

That covid&amp;lottery thing joke anti-maskers, btw. matter number use 'chance catch covid' joke, still higher chance win powerball. China 1mil / 60 = 16,667. Laos 1mil / 3 = 333,333. It’s unnecessary too. people would listen. I'm afraid window effective national mask mandate sailed March April. needed done start. 7-8 month period mandate created culture mask wearing many, establishing mandate nearly useless enforced local level.

If wanted mask mandate effective, state ended lockdowns without tough mask mandate effect. sounds like us Spring. never double room, also stopped elective surgeries, hospital largely empty, able little flexible rooming situation. 

Hope gets better soon. Keep head up. together think trying hard prevent death shows lack faith God.

""Sanctity human life"" applies unborn fetuses. Hey I’ve seen one Fauci saying mass distribution April Lay MSM. Actually trying shrooms may benefit you. Make see much koolaid drinking. Speed limits country make sense Wouldn’t funny D&amp;D “healer” one Covid? point nobody going take seriously 1) vaccine distributed 2) seroprevalence enough spread slows significantly considered getting building put 110 outlet? say need bailing something landlord like right disagreeing predatory capitalism toxic effects society? built it? elites society benefit it. Democrats extremely conservative capitalist party. Europe American capitalist party would ""conservative"" example.

The past present really matter conversation.

I'm talking China/USSR, places fucking autocratic police states. need talk building direct, community based local democracy IMO done capitalism.

As ""human nature"", guess agree disagree. think people ultimately good heart. I've met many shitty kids example, society seems make way. Man, someone like lost mom FB feed all...poor poor him. I'm sitting laughing sorrow. Maybe want help colonoscopies backyard? near limits available treat people, pandemic quietly causing supply chain ""disruptions"" months. instead spending last six months dealing fixing systemic problems, authorities fucked right off. 

So hospitals able handle surge point, imagine we'll soon hearing places even Tylenol give patients let alone anything life-saving.  stop new injections collecting data doubt it. don’t see president make national mask mandate first place. Half AGs country would sue Yea nobody seems taken seriously there's point. city did. shut hard month. community transfer almost 6 months. Life normal months. want rest world normal, people can't seem stop complaining trivial shit turning political fuckery. going make difference. Another 100,000 deaths next six months. summer save you. Ok. entitled educated opinion. state. gave relatives refuse wear masks public (except job) continue travel states.  mandate. 5 airplanes trips since mid March- leisure 2 weddings Interesting. not?

Could declaration state crisis (martial law?) override this?

Or (as unlikely seems) order president force it?

Im qualified US law.


Because believe events like needed. least we’re Great Again. Sigh. genuinely good thing, unless hospitals literally overflowing. Honestly think national mask mandate would change little.

Thanks Dr. Gamer Activist. Communist China mandating masks. that. Communist China checking QR code every entrances. that. Communist China strictly enforcing community lockdown police. that. believe ""Life Free Die"". Democracy prevail. Communists die.

Can Covid-19 virus know difference Democracy Communism? must have. That's chant CCP virus 30 times day, enter exit place. prevent infecting us. Yes. Yes. Yes. found cure. honest, don’t know didn’t wipe groceries pre-Corona. feels silly retrospect. America also largest population first world country long shot. People asthma apparently likely long haulers. personal experience, lot initial covid patients asthma slowed down. Could weather related tho saw video hospitals Wuhan were...like Black Friday Walmart Best Buy, crush people getting trampled others trying first.  accuser guy reviewer said footage.

Not saying right path, accuser argument isn’t really argument Everyone US get covid over. Coincidentally I’m citizen US Brazil OCI India Imagine exhausting must be, shoveling tide this:

“The world virus like Iraq weapons mass destruction”

I’d crying, too. Hmmmmmmmmm nah Lysol? thing cannot remember seeing anything like like forever? /s Cops following law? Naw cray cray. Europe going balls deep virus. Singapore here. NO. Stop spreading argue case. comment going ignorant read today. I'm confident that. actually like Trump he's done manufacturing industry considering I'm manufacturing engineer. no. He's here. belongs business world, politics. Dumbass🥴 “Valar morghulis” 
- President Trump end mentally warped? news Kodak? know points correct. mean half equation disinformation campaigns real researchers, scientists, doctors *know* truth expose disinformation, people still make effort believe disinformation data people real studies. 

Disinfo worth hill beans people weak enough fall it. American hubris display, plain simple. current trajectory, get soon enough. Brace Facebook pity-parties people lament ""how KNOW, poor me!""

Darwinism alive well 2020. I’m longing know too. That’s thing, think aren’t grasping. covid fatigue really setting in. numbers Colorado jumping people hanging others, without masks. universities many issues large parties campuses too. It’s getting scary. send militia Portland Salem 4 weeks ago, absolutely nothing mitigate virus spread borders, hospitals full want send overflow Oregon Washington. aren’t Brown Inslee telling Idaho fuck off? love username. Especially you’re probably one reporting numbers sub. 🤣 come businesses enforcing it. Honestly think national mask mandate would change little.

You're completely wrong.

Arizona months ago. mandate, hardly anyone wearing masks (~25%). Literally day went effect, 90+% wearing them.

There ""enforcement"" measures put place. Businesses put signs advising mandate news ran it. people got onboard right away.

You'll always small percentage think need follow...but make law, people jump board. Reinfections point rare enough they’re issue need worry about. studies suggested many people’s immunity virus could last years, even without presence antibodies.  Anti maskers danger others self defense warranted government/police jobs keep community safe. I’ll bite. Who, specifically? do?  We're almost around corner according people, granted people idiots, still Quality chocolate production time Agreed, say indication. However, correct one hand claim covid death ""such excessive amount"" pretend nothing current lower total mortality. 

The original commenter needs provide explanation sweden something otherwise fantastic w.r.t. public health elderly care order offset difference. 17.500 accurate

Of course -- got three decimal places. America fundamental right face accuser crime.

How one face camera? Agree, humans perfect. seem able one thing though try. I’d rather socially distance wear mask. *If* wins. I’m registered Republican I’m voting Biden, there’s plenty us. Trump idiot national security threat. Seems like lot pent anger, never man life show act like one? Honestly bud, shoes, personally, I’d hang body.  long 100,000 new cases one day?

Recalling reported US covid deaths crested 2000 day back April, already 100,000 cases per day assuming fatality rate excess 0.5%. assume mean people hate abortion also oppose free birth control. Condoms cheap. can't afford condom can't afford sex. also come added benefit reducing ridiculous STD rates, win win. look I'll gladly pay birth control means stop ripping baby piece piece sucking vacuum like piece trash carpet, least see pay something that's responsibility? many ways avoid pregnancy reluctance try instead opt terminate pregnancy people want pay negligent behavior can't imagine understand pushback. notion taking responsibility avoid pregnancy notion taking responsibility child failed first one completely lost you, right? Current research shows re-infections rare (Qatar study estimate 0.04% 0.01% vast majority mild (there five six cases exceptions, millions cases) reasons believe vaccine would produce stronger lasting immune response natural infection. literally pedophile China! Seriously...a couple dozen reinfections \~40 million cases (more like 1 billion cases believe WHO's estimates). COVID's circulating year now. STRONG circumstantial evidence 1 year immunity, probably longer too.

If immunity wore even year, we'd seeing dozens dozens reinfections day point.

The ""no immunity"" ""short immunity"" narrative accepted many people, including media, drives fucking crazy. Case fatality rate intellectually honest use. takes confirmed cases compares deaths. virus asymptomatic 40% people. means enormous amounts people get virus never even know get tested, making actual death rate far lower. 

I already cited CDC, updates page daily hasn’t changed estimate. account asymptomatic cases place actual death rate 0.4%

So source technically month, bud. word maybe really best vocabulary doctor. mean scientific. true untrue. Obviously crashes correct degree crash would less disastrous March less likely March know treat better better prepared. make sound like treatment hasnt changed 6 months disingenuous Issue mandate enforced. Half America virus care experts saying comments, another example people subreddit pro-science facts confirm biases. Yeah isn’t Mormon thing. family recently sick cold. stayed home none us sick. Nobody went COVID test. COVID cases county, schools go back online only. can’t happen. Many, parents area think way. incentive government set people reacting it. live NY, father brother decided take trip Oklahoma weekend, expected return tomorrow. don’t trust responsible take necessary precautions order remain safe, need advice ensure responsible possible. work retail come contact lot people, really don’t want infect anyone. think caught it?

Work?

Family Gathering? think health expert tears best possible job trying lead. fucking easily led simpleton. 

Shut fuck sit down.  mentally worn out? near rate April. Utah? I’m wondering part reason don’t want test kids? see kids thriving school. would assume moment crisis executive order could passed, president would ever think thing logical difference population density.

Yes, clearly working well Russia US /s Except Sweden hasn’t opened anything. People behaving like European countries throughout pandemic. 

Minus masks. celebrations bridges beating virus. unnecessary risk? would go? people fucking stupid? stay hell home, can’t skip pumpkin carving one lousy year? Completely true. Look major European countries, spikes going weeks, deaths little. 
Look Sweden crying loud, explain almost deaths days?  20 people room hours everyday without mask. pandemic obviously high risk situation.

Because people young mostly asymptomatic. Everywhere cases spiking schools reopened.

Again, asymptomatic come back home infect parents go work officially origin infection someone else symptoms. parent asymptomatic probably considered close contact someone else. kid close contact close contact, still going around spreading virus. say maybe strong advocacy policy/political decisions compromises appearance intellectual neutrality. He's much resolute idea wearing masks outside federal/state policy decisions. Yeah thats valid point.  Look wrote previous posts make fool yourself. seem touble reading, since I've clearly stated I'm masks. ""This food salty, would know civil engineer"" Switzerland also 15 cases day initial lockdown lockdown effective believe? Remember month ago Illinois people sub laughing Wisconsin spike? $140 seems going rate, really gouging. Thank this. frustrated person claiming higher level knowledge doesn’t correlate opinions many people verifiable experience field. It’s hard know trust. show decreasing support getting vaccinated battles science politics weakened trust government agencies evaluate recommend vaccines. Enthusiasm vaccine particularly low among Black Americans, group especially hard hit COVID-19. Republicans less likely seek vaccine Democrats. Polling STAT Harris Poll found percentage Americans said would get vaccine soon possible dropped 69% mid-August 58% early October. Several polls found half Americans want COVID-19 shot. Nope.

I quoted advocated letting virus run course believe long term effects economy far outweigh damage virus doing.

So economy matters actual people. people going die one way another. 

You say anything. guess abandon modern going. context. Misrepresented. full wrong. 

That describes every single lie told [this called dodged completely. Yeah. Someone twitter claimed 95% state wearing masks. told yeah, see them. Behind scenes restaurants wearing them. I've seen employees wear masks, touch food bare hands even sneeze right next food proceed finish job without much washing hands. saying people lot messed shit think people watching. hate thanks apathy display. mistrust happens government (for experience german one) media pushed big time everybody get vaccinated mediocre diseases new hyped up, vaccines full side effects lot people suffered from. big consequences free money grab (the pharmaceutical companies liable all, mishaps happen government pays). would different covid vaccines? covid can't kill badly tested vaccine could get side effects life. think done smartly. need 2 meters tables masked waiting staff. Keep music people shout. Check temps seating. Throw people symptoms. Air circulation humidity looked at. found 5G actually spread virus useless burn towers? Seriously, expected see kind thing happening EU country. People wearing masks in: 
France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic....and still massive spikes. screaming masks completely misdirected. agree you. 

I live HB it’s ridiculous. majority wearing masks Caucasian middle-aged. 

If know Main St is, tell it’s fucking packed people dining socializing every day. masks. social distancing. It’s disgusting.

They’re even challenging stores mask mandate almost opposition. Costa Mesa signs mandating masks receiving $100 fine police aren’t enforcing it. 

This gives reason move family can’t seem let go hometown, despite increasing living costs can’t afford. did. annoying. anyone’s life building worth $100? choice manager make.

And let’s clear here, dude makes shit ton money compared making minimum wage. He’s single, doesn’t kids, Mortage, etc. he’s GM store, secure job place besides owner, makes us minimum wage workers combined. thought US evil world country hard time covid ??

I'm going blow mind this, but. 

The US CONSTANTLY bad. Europe phases it. 

The big 5 western countries (UK, FR, Germany, Italy, Spain) size population US. also ***5 million*** less cases.  cautious rushed vaccine isn’t thing refusing take vaccine saved lives 50+ years little bad effects. Stood long voting line 500 people I’d say mask compliance 60-70%. Please make mandatory. look graph new cases per day basically looks like steps staircase. climb up, plateau while, start climbing again. count climb surge indeed beginning third surge. surprised biggest surge given indoor gatherings increase holiday season people already tired pandemic eager socialize despite risks. say nothing mass transit students/workers takes place every year around time go home. going massacre, really hope I'm paranoid. Schools vacation week What? I’ve gotten tested tickled little bit one two tears show stuff nose. expecting much much worse. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *Dr. Tit Sauce equivalent 148,500 cases nationwide. good. mean? got two billing reports. $100 test $40 lab result, think $140 least correct price these. Cases reinfection aren’t anecdotal, scientific fact. handful US confirmed genetic testing. cases, second infections worse first. future, avoid using backside data source. Would given 100 dollars pay day? choice manager make. Wuhan contained it, China contained it, populous country earth. bunch countries like Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia etc... contained well. 

No country claim ""uncontainable"" admit ignorance, arrogance stupidity. start implementing right policies. scientific community said virus would done 2 weeks 2 months? seem recall saying 2021 earliest return normal since around concerts, large events

So? Hell, even authorized many people would go them? Would even economically see family loved ones.

Also, so? moved away mother 15 years ago. I've seen twice time. even met 11 year old nephew. course love mom, going kill can't visit person can't visit me. parents day say scientists wrong climate change, 80s wrong global cooling. لعنهم الله school district numerous parents send kids school COVID signs symptoms. turned one campuses getting shut less 2 weeks in-person school. 

This would survive zombie apocalypse. Lumping Christians people incentivizes take common ground people. That's there's much money push ""war Christmas"" propaganda; unite Christians would otherwise tell megachurch grifters pound sand. Yeah see car speeding. Thats tangible.

They can't see coronavirus racism objects. invisible like wind, Jesus, wonder woman's jet plane. Look youtube bro. one annoying songs ever hear life people sang hear song would likely embarrassed it. makes worse catchy hard get head hear it. fact, trying hear right now. also Chassidic sections New York wherecertain zip codes surges selectively closed. New York, 3% threshold shutting neighborhood. pandemic response total disaster get go.

Hello! Welcome club.

\- Britain, France, Italy, Spain, USA, Russia, Brazil.. Ooh you’re much refined me. bad. Yeah also hottest summer record. really screwed every way. would think public health crisis good reason mandate something

I mean, mandate vaccination flu could considered realm public health. government constitutional right to, period. 99.7% survival rate people get infected bud. makes sad, honestly mean want people Sweden die stick conservatives? Please tell im misunderstanding you. 

 humane way dealing conservative problem would explain that:

- sweden heard immunity strategy
- lot measures place order stop virus.
- life Sweden definitily before

It true Sweden might fever restrictions (but lot people think) parts US. fever restrictions one left/progressive societies world. want go Swedish way also tell sweden highest taxes high incomes world, free healthcare etc Well 10 15 people weekly gathering families, everyone touching hugging getting close thats lot people covid. India testing enough extremely well (compared France) lying

India done 73,000 tests per 1m population.

France done 224,000 tests per 1m population. Yes please seriously still discussion!?!? problem Berlin districts mentioned large extent inhabited non-German (eg turkish, arabian) residents. different way living. recently still large scale marriages hundreds people. Ironically also funeral Arabic clan funeral mother died covid-19. Still lot came people attending.
Berlin 3rd largest turkish city world based turkish residents. Antivax people really fascinate me. Lol  Right? would know? They're doctors decades study experience exactly issue. They're biased towards medical knowledge safety. Silly intelligent people.


(/s obvious) someone living Arizona, sucks. spent summer cooped inside hot step out. weather finally starting cool down, cases nationwide surging again. snowbirds coming here, it'll even worse. always made joke wife sending kids “capitalist indoctrination camp”. America deeply committed dream attending college. It’s far less interested education students supposedly attend.

This cements that. going send college, gain debt never get it. unique perspective middle aged career changer going cert program. given remote student teaching option due poor advising refuse place remote kids, I’m taking Ed going try avenues certification. find job now. There’s bunch remote opportunities, cannot guarantee one It’s “policy”. set one said can’t accept it. said it’s fair students principles. tried remind plague. Funniest part is, zoom meeting. houses spring. principles. trying get send ATM pin, assume. Id disagree - definitely contributes, believe technical innovation, ability record pass information, use tools biggest catalysts.

Bees, ants, etc much better organized large volumes, fish. 

Human society know fairly new concept grand scheme things, historically end well. egyptian, roman empires, feudalism, communism, capitalism democracy - biggest ‘success’ would mention, limited time scale. successful empire puts fast track wide spread pandemics mass extinction climate change?

Yet pyramids, colosseum, art, writing/teachings remain, future generations learn evolve. 

Even perish sources, provided intelligent life able thrive - may find traces work continue evolve. “Local parent Facebook groups” aka anal hemorrhoids honest, EU yesterday 159,000 cases. Man, sub determines political random. I've written three messages mods asking clarification, nothing. makes feel like they're trying prevent participating. know try contact mods since never get reply. Nobody brain denies Covid exists Korea good example.

Its almost ridiculous me. 

Like point, Jesus fuck, cant British, French, German, Spanish, Italian American governments bring Korean government/scientists tell us sort shit out. would lot easier every 3 months. work school won’t even tell us positive cases, bunch kids gone. superintendent zoom meeting us tells us adults giving Covid adults kids giving kids ... there’s two strains?

I still haven’t found information support it. think that's case. Hospitals probably got better treatment. 200,000 people sounds like lot compare population country population old people country.

there's sign somehow tapped pool vulnerable people. That's really infectious disease works magically get vulnerable people within first months. That's talk pandemics like coming waves even something like Spanish flu would get long-term immunity survived there's still massive swaths people get first wave got second third. little different flu mutate much faster really science know exactly back then, real point infectious diseases still take several years infect 50% global population unless amazingly infectious like maybe measles.

This virus infectious enough rip global population put significant dent demographics. killed 1.1 million people far globally 7 billion. safe say made almost dent vulnerable population yet unless understanding vulnerable populations extremely flawed. speak experience able book appointment low 5 minutes later. obviously places might well regard. good know, thanks ever discussed mortality? Maybe care around 10 20 years like this. Nobody guaranteed long life many willing take risk. suggest asking relatives difficult questions respecting them. evidence support saying? Nope.

I advocated letting virus run course believe long term effects economy far outweigh damage virus doing. people going die one way another. want spread dying pain long? Forever? 

Jesus Christ. 

Keep going. context. Misrepresented. full wrong. 

I'm sure everyone get frustrated inability understand read, think argument. bad abusive relationship. thought America comply get shot, fault, here's :). /s People would listen leadership would lead. Tomorrow same. I'm sure happens actually rule. know plenty people left church still part community.

I'd guess common Utah crazies. Poland missed first wave lockdown early. Believe Ur choice, numbers telling story Ur brain apparently cant comprehend. U likely young healthy (if u u idiot) u dont care 'its flu'. Guess what, even mild corona give u ongoing health issues u young healthy. Good luck u need it, gather u probably dont believe masks 🤷🏻‍♀️ partner work (pharmacists) COVID denier well. idea lol incumbent upon us light torches run fascists town. Cops uphold law cops, enemy insurgents. Defend nation, America! know feel, things do:

Get sub browse “good news” flair don’t read comments 

Stop reading news unless need to

Take time chill downvotes? utterly hypocritical lockdown skeptics U.S. arent arms mask supply. We're 9 months crap N95's still shortage reserved medical professionals. That’s good move. accurate rapid testing needed test negative catch virus later day. Rapid testing airports, schools, offices, hospitals, dental clinics, venue gathering would best solution keep society going decrease spread. Positives would able get places infect others. Masks still worn everyone countries rapid testing isolate positives let rest us go on. Right positives tested mingling negatives. That’s virus keeps circulating. Assuming sample covers region comparable one touch, one contaminated every 10000th frozen food product consumed.

No problem frozen foods, rate holds true standard supermarket cool chain food, another story.
IDK others eat, consume least 5-10 products day.
Let's hope factor 10 100 somewhere there, virus really short half-life real life. ""The magnificent, tremendous wave ever seen. Bigger wave earth."" knew somehow Karen’s would find way make worse even mormons live everyones family atleast 4 children 10, average number count 6 want online class entertaining TV show better pay teachers actors equally directly linked article can't find it. I'm mobile. mandated wont immediate termination. Main job enforce rule law dinosaurs providing content. willingness adapt used mankind's strength, recently lack willingness adapt looks downfall. live can't find salad $10?

Also US put ton effort addressing issues well, either arguing bad faith ignoring reality. Thanks! people getting reinfected? nothing fact negligible risk kids. think anyone one. Trump's approach let state's figure vaccine would deployed nationalized approach state's really sure would possibly look like. End result really national plan all. Whether there's plan depends live.  also consistent troughs waves. like storm surge, goes up, maybe dresses back little, goes higher. US isn’t country schools. It’s well established schools aren’t hotspot super spreaders. already know Europe. 99% nz success due geography. please let Belgium, france, Spain, UK, Germany do. Basically previously Covid confirmed antibody prevalence 6+ months infection. Friendly reminder: lump Christians people. know fall deaf ignorant ears, worth try guess. Masks one part swiss cheese approach safety. big part actually. But, Nothing perfect holes, everything stacks. limit transmission. Try approach yourself. Stack swiss cheese see many pieces takes till cant see it. Then, take middle piece see much see. dont wear mask. Masks, good hygene, social distancing, limiting gathering sizes, limiting travel, etc. good things limit transmission. also failure compared Norway.

They tried something different. Something professionals believed effective approach others taken. professionals proved right.

But thanks geography Sweden compared none Scandinavian western Europe possible spin Swedish approach success. Qué every anti mask anti lockdown proponent jumping proof right. numbers clearly show wrong. Well lot areas bad believe not. area specifically almost nothing, since kids extremely low risk pretty good precautions taken, sports taking place. Zero cases even remotely linked sports I'm at. Hey, never mentioned *which* Easter virus would gone :3

*Taps forehead*

^Jumps ^out ^window UW huge outbreak rn 95% frats/sororities. people definitely liberal all. We're least American liberal still pretty conservative. responding post environmental factors driving people say kids kids. Well mid-70s book became prominent called Population Bomb. people calling parents destroying planet breeding. see argument 40s surreal. Believe environmental degradation huge concern 70s spring anew ether oughts teens 21st century.

So yes, factors led birth rate falling mid late 70s book concern environmental degradation overpopulation people streets applying social pressure people kids.

You might want read green revolution part doomsday scenarios population bomb didn’t happen. It’s still nothin reality though live America I'm sorry tell guys still first wave. Germany, responsible look others. save even 1 life yes.

Burn ground.

What kind question ?

In essence asking important, lives money. forget low obesity. talking about? blaming people depressed depression? know anyone would thought would go away sooner.

Might certain leader country said would gone Easter, ~40% said country believes him. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Sounds like be, idea even go though. India two advantages: young median age, low obesity. have. cdc also attempted make mandate mandatory masks public transport. White House blocked them. fault always lied content, masked fact students could disciplined paying attention past really miss college days😭, care per capita numbers. people sick. would much rather less people sick saying lower percentage people relative countries population. humans talking man. data. Recognise this. vaccine risk treatments much easier real second wave , surge  middle stupidity wave.   Seattle pretty much everyone wears mask too. problem weekend rural people drive city good time. people governor's front lawn rifles first mention mask mandate back April. 

clearly places really well going stop outbreak country large one people mobile are. Fair enough. So? know means lot people, means nothing me. old “only case cuz we’re testing” moron shit. apostrophe remember reading NYC strain significantly virulent one plaguing US right now, don’t know true is. guys think colleges gonna able reopen Jan/February winter break? know cases spiking aren’t even dead winter... already closed restaurants, bars, schools. curfew 6pm visiting others houses. Everyone working home.

Until take seriously take real action, number continue get worse. Based. 20% tested. Thought meant ""back entire world population"", no, I'm old.  Oh god, stop insanity. 

For KIDS, influenza much dangerous. (Yes, case older adults I’m saying is).

You’re free make choices parent. live, like 80% kids back school guess everyone’s “trash tier” (though think that’s rather distasteful comment part). irresponsible disseminate statements flat false. Wtf guys?

Seriously :/

All anti-maskers *actually* going force strict measures *actually* hinder freedoms result sheer stupidity. virus align political opinions, it'll murder entire family everyone care without judgement...

*Sigh*  say dangerous. said disagree leaving stats make seem LESS dangerous. Thats manipulative imo people see it. agree last sentence. significant portion lower death rate attributed testing. nearly many people tested 1st wave. daily cases counts time reflect reality. Lol. Word. Damn. ""Fill State"" reports ""Fill Number"" new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase record.

The headlines winter. Exponential growth mean would done much faster tho. either! I’m still loss got place significant portion American citizens rejected science utterly completely. Suddenly dead Americans doesn’t mean much. “They’re sick/fat/poor/lazy/old/etc! That’s died Covid!” 


Ugh. Source, provide context Germany actually lot spare beds. number points France ambulance ride, like Strasbourg.

Germany also two ICU equipped planes. That's took Italian patients first wave.

As lock Germany? two town/cities know already lock down, city live in? We're edge it. Bravo, Slovakia! Nobody knows work, good example European nations ACT now! Mandating largely moot. right hard work delegitimizing science left hard work delegitimizing law enforcement. mandate want people follow one going enforce it. think time even among medical establishment common belief masks little prevent transmission viral infections

With several studies suspicious even rate infection might huge impact value masking. C19 happens sweet spot masks actually make difference.

Covid special unique. transmits coughing. kills numbers comparable past pandemics. single greatest statistical advantage America zip code advantage. gave unborn son don’t look others sacrifices behind keyboard. change words ""mask mandate"" ""marijuana prohibition"" I'll like post much better. 

Sad true: know country able summon literal armies prevent people smoking harmless weed able make citizens wear masks prevent pandemic. Costco hot dogs shit Rounding corner circle. amazing. one rounds corner circle better us. fact Sweden never hard lockdown pretty effective soft lockdown ever since March go long. never opened up. police dept./sheriff's dept. said thing. live Arkansas. remember days too. probably reading posts sub February going “wait minute, get bad”. asked manager’s manager heard anything testing workers large workplace (which measles, along vaccines) catch outbreak looked like crazy laughed. week later, closed, able reopen, may time will.

But it’s weird you’re wearing mask. virus hasn’t evolved less harmful deadly, hospitals got better saving people. They’re pretty clear that. still care giving people even don’t care catch yourself. it’s denial. People downvoting hold vaccinations accurate attempts “clairvoyance” contradict Faucis statement kind real normality would return mid next year. many people subreddit called “pessimism bias.” Black Plague Friday like throughout human history, nothing new. People gone wars, died for, gone ways name religion. is. 

I'm theist draw line practice caution public safety compromised. simple what's baffling many simpletons society. pandemic definitely exposed types people. NZ government told us beginning based initial response countries like Taiwan Vietnam doing. Geography mean much virus actually got community spreading. answer money! people die can't afford it. matter capability facilities people still dying can't afford it.

That's bad healthcare system. know perfectly well fit curve. /u/congalines asked much total deaths fluctuate year year? 1-2% 10-15% really unheard of?

If deaths grow year upon year 1.1-1.3% span years, cannot fit straight line growth answer /u/congalines' question residual. answering different question asked. Yes, wait vaccine.

250,000 dead reopened. Well pandemic end socially regardless pretty much anything, wouldn’t plan forever, certainly foreseeable future. selfish people people complains economical effects pretend care expending months giving shit consequences actions. Sturgis super spreader event debunked? burrow owl

nice reference go cooties. never rule cooties. Thanks link. Brilliant article! federal system government, 1st amendment, capitalism, GOP using pandemic economic gain political leverage.

At point, profit treating victims curing them. 

The demand ""therapeutic treatments"" goldmine investors. 

We cannibalizing dumb know care. 

Insane $1 mask could influence election. Ok I’m going ask serious question: actually think every time virus infects someone, get tested? Including Asymptomatic, mild cases symptoms indistinguishable common cold? that’s way 2.7%(CFR) actually real death rate.

Also words “rate” “ratio” mean thing. rate expressed ratio. fundamentally different calculations. CFR IFR different however. huge leap. kids back school WAY happier it. actually missed went back, thriving top notch school peers. Yes say one point time also said May Masks nothing.. masks panacea even quoted New England Journal Medicine agreed stance. claiming masks merely symboloc gesture dogoodery... since flip flopped stance issue.. saying is, never shut down, can't provide proof such. Got it. Restaurants already prove authorization remain open. health department approval paper visible every establishment times even without pandemic. Again, seems ""shut down"" made head never actually happened. Facts care feelings. first really like it. high school teacher much exhausting classroom. zooms day draining especially one leading entire zoom majority talking zoom. gone though, like things get used it. I've gotten groove bad now, although looking forward school teaching safe return am. miss interactions energy students classroom. There's many students feel know rarely speak often turn camera on. (They lose participation points turning cameras care)

I say students online definitely helped. getting distracted friends like would school, there's much outside world able focus work more. special ed english language students major barriers causing worse. school actually offering one-on-one person tutoring students fall categories starting next week, hopefully helpful students.

But definitely perks teachers students, like able get get snack fridge whenever like, wearing comfy pajama bottoms people going see torso up. Overall, I'll happy never get another zoom call again, meantime happy report online learning going lot better thought would. Attendance high grades consistent would normal school year, low income school - things seem working far. Truth. Last week walking street, three cops start calling across street. Turns wanted make fun wearing mask. Fuckers. non-confrontational ass mumbled walked away embarrassment. America realise needs wear masks? planning virus masking part lives US indefinitely.  Looks like lab opened quickly deal immediate demand. It’s people individually adapting. Everyone decides acceptable level risk, visit crowded bars every day others isolate home get groceries delivered lot people between. government won’t regulate anything help us, it’s kind everyone what’s best personally. That’s extreme individualist culture you. happened although couldn’t get test mid March outside Houston. Wife tested positive IgG antibodies end June. Always wondered still them. pretty cautious ever need go out. local hospital group (part Texas medical center) offered free antibody tests. Surprisingly enough aren’t many positive antibody tests area. can't solve problem, almost every country broke. 

Maybe keep printing money. cause issues otherwise. best tracing system world? 

When cult outbreak happened, everyone praised South Korea’s tracing, later, tests showed South Korea detected 10 percent cases, par every country. 

Something else happened South Korea stop spread. wasn’t testing. missing 92 percent cases like every country.  Seems like U.S. needs game want stay top...   Lol posted story...my friend wrong place wrong site post anything sprint bunker gonna die ....oh yea. even tho cdc says 80 percent positive case ppl wearing mask. .mask stop this... told falsely quote me. uncivil. keep falsely quoting me. Please respond correctly, come poor troll right now.

No, quoting words time remove context posts form misquotation. Nobody serious writing.


No, *tjänstefel* works like that. complete fantasy Sweden unique laws makes unique can't battle corruption. Like every country can.

No, ""irrelevant"" say so. can't explain irrelevant, acting like child putting fingers ears screaming ""I can't hear you"". Extremely embarrassing.

No, isn't. Sweden laws countries. ""When will, way"". told you, embarrassing repeat myself. can't legally force people stay home (they can), change law (they want to). enforce ""soft"" lockdowns, rebranding, like Uppsala.

It's absolutely laughable seem think foreign experts can't take Swedish laws account. can. judgement would still harsh. chances survival open plan office 100 people windows? Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Upvoted automoderator comment misleading subreddit? literally /r/coronavirusUK recommended sidebar subreddit... that's exactly we've got.

No, not. little anything, mask mandate much reduce spread disease?

Both teachers pupils showing 3x infection rate general population, least funding come from? 

The infrastructure already set first lockdown, need extra much stop spread? 

It's germany infection rate less half ours, people packed inside, even though 18°

You'd obviously need forbid indoor service time. Honestly, surprised rolling lockdowns many years. \*This CDC-suggested guideline point. Guessing Trump ignore/do exact opposite. Right people seem recover uneventfully home, sometimes little symptoms sometimes rather nasty symptoms including fever, fatigue, cough, shortness breath etc. There's medication (beyond OTC pain cold medication control symptoms) people home. Hospitals developed protocols include medication (notable steroids anticoagulatants) well non medication inventions help people really trouble breathing (things like patients lie stomachs delaying ventilation patients low oxygen blood respiratory distress). 

Most hospitalized patients go home alive, although risk death obviously higher time ill enough need hospital. There's studies types interventions effecting mortality. Here's summary one: Don’t love natural selection? trying prevent getting yet dumbasses think youre good follow rules... maybe think second... Also covid deadly thought people either symptoms, mild symptoms die it. 

In Germany example 85% deaths 70 years old. Yeah, Malaysia wealthy, well equipped USA, also lesser beds USA, Malaysia bed density 1.9 per 1000 USA 2.8 per 1000. 

So arguably need reach USA level infection overwhelm healthcare system. Eye meake acksiadent girrl, yew paye honestly would rather end reduced lung capacity whatever follow restrictions rest life. Hoax show reputation poster go profile, can't always see immediately whether post expert (you, apparently), someone spamming content, random person qualifications.

There flair right name posts says something like, “Verified PhD”. might depend browser app using though. 

Plus think 100 responses thread I’m one provided links either help explain point act evidence support statements may made felt requiring it. alone obvious giveaway ;). 

In scientific world cannot get paper published makes claims without source. source may findings study published findings. 

If you’re discussion colleague, even person, know paper(s) support claims you’re making able state author(s), title journal it’s published in. It’s part multifaceted problem

We sometimes refer wicked problem:

 “*a problem whose social complexity means determinable stopping point*""

“*Moreover, complex interdependencies, effort solve one aspect wicked problem may reveal create problems*”

Source: politician loudest

Right it’s speaking loudest perhaps biggest platform. I’m hopeful end decisions say, set ways opinions, really hard change them. Sometimes, even trying purpose

In cases known confirmation see ""mild"" cases

We don’t see asymptomatic cases either, problematic epidemiologists trying use data creative predictive people far likely spread disease

And (possibly) likely ignore authorities (there groups different reasons) they’re likely feel “invincible”. Behaviour change difficult implement eith respect health. learned HIV quickly. It’s expensive someone who’s almost billion dollars debt guess. Smh. appointment kind symbolic act? thinking working advisor rather minister could better fit stay poliitics side it.

If so, problem he's become symbol caught symbolic act disregarding mask mandate occasion. light that, makes target oppositon, well disliked internally instead 'antisymbol'.

Ultimately think losers mess, proceeding discussions best way cut losses. Unless he's symbolically appointed, defense line ""Ok, slip-up, looks like bad PR, safe, nobody risk etc...""

(disclaimer: I'm outsider dont know much, interest, CZ politics) Imagine feeling entitled hospitality years. Geez. want get Mr. Bones' wild ride know conflate ""enforcing borders like 200,000 lives depends it"" ""ruthless localism"" beyond obvious.

We're either going treat infectious disease life death issue, going return internationalism practicing before. mutually exclusive states. voted? affect calculated mortality rate? 2:23 - ""five years now""

Thanks, Obama Thought paraphrasing, quote verbatim. Got bunch dumbskis board Idaho Well since approaching winter course going report type shit. Goal bankrupt America economy collapse civil unrest happens Marshall law deep state take over. obvious since 9/11. know bush got everyone’s panties bunch guided everyone believe needed invade Middle East. Took poppy fields 10 years later opiate epidemic. Thanks big pharm. pay attention. whole thing bs. 20+ years. beginning phase end game. Hence toilet paper apocalypse. test. 20% public panicked system would total meltdown. hope going prepare it’s going way worse. nose shit, long time neck shit I'm worried going symptom line like Chickenpox Shingles. holidays gonna great! /s Missouri hospitals overflowing rural areas weeks. Suburban areas around St. Louis back rise (we better mask mandate). positivity rate mid 20s. First, want thank calm-headed respectful tone response. normal particularly subreddit rare disagreement applaud it.

I agree part blame civil society. already reminded everyday. country live (Morocco), government hesitate blame population time spike cases - even factory destrined exports government close - forget responsibility awful ranking human development index, freedom press, levels poverty country etc. 

In world seems certain proportion people abide rules, what's fault ? Yes, significant proportion population shown utter responsibility, disagree that, see also shamed blamed media/government everyday, part responsibility denied, constantly highlighted.

On hands, rarely talks government responsiblity contradictory messaging, bad communication (either stoking fear ""motivate"" people, telling want hear) improvised measures.

We rarely talk responsiblity government health services obsesity crisis. all, government health services responsible covid-19, approach always focused health level focus/harsh restrictions/laws pertaining obesity junk food, maybe would've less problem now. 

And like say, many government Europe enabled attitude, opened fast started encouraging tourism even, responsibility highlighted enough. that, even use low number cases reopening test different approach, like focusing cluster busting imposing remorte work whenever possible (in France still ""recommended"" corporations etc), France (i cite country lot i've following news), even made utter failure app-tracing app even ministers admitted using, asking population use it. Czech, health minister caught going restaurant decreting restaurants closure rest population. always passively let virus run decrete lockdown, continue trusted ? . Madness thing expecting different solution. Yeah, I'd trust numbers coming China. How's South Korea doing? third option differentiated, targeted restrictions 

Umm, that's exactly we've got. suggesting something more? Okay, give concrete examples show they'll sufficient stop exponential spread virus. Distance learning secondary higher education

I see. much reduce spread disease? funding come from? test-and-trace focused workplaces instead generalized

Explain much stop spread? lifting restrictions public space use restaurants operate open air without shutting down

You say Italian, believe you, least Tuscany, people sit outside weather cold, even there's space. there's plenty outdoor space, people packed inside, even though 18°. wife tried sit table outside two days ago told serve us cold. Loosening restrictions change all. 

From sit, suggested basket changes highly questionable poorly considered proposals little nothing stop spread virus inevitable economic consequences runaway pandemic. Is... real quote? Mind testing wasnt accessible certainly cases back may. But..... info used disregard increase.... winter going potentially worse spring.  gift keeps giving. mob mentality reddit groups like frightening, anything mob agree gets downvoted. 
I think points quite valid. never said that, reduce cases. wearing masks surefire way, precautions well. actually measure risk covid. I'm France 100 deaths per day. told €1 million lotto 100 winners every day France, I'd say pretty good odds buy ticket. still staying home. Ah fuck.  Hey there. I'm republican.

Have talked republican before? not, I'm open talking positions agree disagree party.

Just start off, I'm Covid denier. AMA. guess missed cdc releasing fact 80 percent positive cases people wore mask . Thinking mask stop wishful thinking imo . feel like people really care anymore Daily Yep. pretty well here, still well. ~100 less cases day days. almost beat rebound. 100 causes panic lol. sure - get one each! feel man, 100%. yard stick human accomplishment measured by. make buck. point systems stopped improving people's lives became self perpetuating. I've thinking exactly said last years. 

I walk Target marvel akers bullshit shelves, probably 90% totally unnecessary. Everything tree cut somewhere oil pumped ground, processed, manufactured, shipped, stocked, refined, painted, sent across world damn funko pop nonsense could sit shelf end landfill. resources manpower takes get one piece crap shelf astounding. that's one store one city one little tiny little corner one country. 

Meanwhile people homeless, starving, dying world over. know feel man, get hit emptiness thinking it. futility all, people speak meaning life, really it?

We species place technologically could overcome problems decided to. Evolutionarily though we're still stuck selfish, tribal, survival mode. Sadly systems working perpetuate suffering, simply indifferent it, entrenched. virus brought stark relief holes society faults priorities one cares look.

Stay safe man, change things better every chance get. Even little bit keep eye bigger picture. county, 1:21 worst part is, many aren’t even getting tested symptoms. Missouri’s positivity rate 20%. less 5%.  Australia New Zealand quietly going business... religion cancer cases, also, Covid friendly.

Minister Education declared grandly closing schools March mistake, would stay open matter what. understand logic. Severe cases kids exceedingly rare, close schools might well lock down, parents need stay home watch kids. 

Now, I'm scientist, pretty good idea going happen stick bunch kids (which likely light symptoms, keep spreading much longer someone gets sick stays home) public transportation every day rush hour adults going work, let marinate poorly ventilated classroom 8 hours, send grandparents school, home that.

I dispute closing schools last measure want take. time, seems like brainer cases going explode. think hoping slower spread this, get much school time possible, maybe even make vaccine without hospitals collapsing. Since we're building first field hospital October, we're proper fucked.

At time, lot people bristling fact that, keep schools economy running, measures social sphere. compliance rather low. all, okay average Joe take bus work 50+ people work dozens colleagues, can't go drink boys afterwards, go visit family...

That's hard pill swallow lot folks.

Oh, good one, racist little septic tank!!!!! say every human suffer PTSD depends people's immune systems original virus loads. 

This medical staff dying higher rate. initial load always higher average people. us masks life savers. obviously cab still get Covid everyone wears masks.

If tell someone gonna die car crash drive car - thats fearmongering. *can* die crash, chances happening low (but low catching COVID twice, say, even dying it).

Look, say possible, unlikely. unlikely, fact, saying 100% fact, isnt likely happen, **fearmongering**.

Stop it. Stop telling people reinfected handful people little evidence back up.

Stop it. majority people (90%+) catch COVID experience little symptoms complications it.

Stop it. IFR disease low enough yall need stop fucking spouting insane '83k cases!' numbers 83 *thousand* people dying it. Thats metric.

Stop it. stop. safe, wear mask, dont stupid, **FUCKS SAKE STOP FEARMONGERING PEOPLE**.  Better Europe.

E.g. New York terrible spring control since then. rest world get waves America get stairs. Fair enough. Parabola.* findings contradict assumptions yes. they're also flawed methodology, described non conclusive, go clearly established COVID-19 scientists. 

I'm using critical thinking. agree me. dismissing skepticism anti-science seem warranted here. hell acting like they’re one pain? You’re making shit complain about. read comments article scratching head. People acting data presented piece final word. ""You believe science fits agenda."" article states inconclusive. article site empirical studies data reliable valid. not? any. Instead, talks random sampling done throughout country draws parallels countries may may hand sudden surges Covid cases. relevant, enough make concrete decisions, seems scientist believe much seem press still need practicing preventative measures whether certain groups individuals susceptible not.

The problem discourse around schools complex hypocritical. Prior pandemic, people claiming much in-person education important academic, social, emotional, behavioural development young people give shit. pandemic hurting society government treated glorified babysitters, suddenly issue. Furthermore, schools exist bubble. may lead cause even scientist referenced article speak least confounding variables. article speaks students rates transmission potentially ""super spreaders"" highly instrumental recent surges, state students can't spread vulnerable populations. addition, students ones schools. teachers, administration, support staff, etc? Oh, that's right. would willingly sacrifice ""public servants"" means less inconvenienced. Parents send children school sick flu even chicken pox. think Covid.

What done is, instead spending summer praying virus away, coming serious strategies provide optimal education regardless circumstance. done ensure better online learning practices resources. schools funding access additional staff PPE. Social distancing, mask wearing, etc ""optional"" political talking points mandates. cannot keep pandemic pay try provide adequate learning environments schools overcrowded, underfunded, mercy greedy politicians, desperate parents, ignorant public. 

Lastly, issues education, needs educators involved decision making process. know deal is, why, years, people know shit-all happens inside classroom. instead turning preliminary findings hyperbole article did, looking doctors scientists made schools primary focus prior pandemic. guy jaywalks theoretically increasing likelihood traffic incident? drunk takes piss alley? somebody discarded cigarette non-designated spot? Surely must inform employers mis-deeds.

If want take police fellow humans business right so. However give sort moral high ground, mostly makes dick interested watching judging others going day.

To clear, remotely advocating behaviour described. men store, abiding store policy/local by-laws wrong. can't comprehend willingness jump nosefirst somebody elses business like that. I'm sorry PM.
I hate president trade BoJo. reconsider course Antivaxers bored letting kids die. they're taking everyone's kids them. /s(i think) obscure something plausible covid? people really interesting ways thinking going take lot masks slow substantially.  90% wearing masks? sounds well percentage necessary stop spread - estimates I’ve seen 70-80% population masking stop spread. 

Which good thing - literally measure *anything* requires 100% compliance doomed fail never get it; lower threshold effectiveness makes measure capable succeeding.  Wow, great mothers. Risk spreading shit around school keep schools open.

""Keep schools open""

Second, spew cloud coronavirus breath onto somebody else end dead hospital, different driving drunk? snowflakes could worn mask prevented spread infection. snowflake police crying people want stop killing unarmed civilians fucking get it. believe point is, shouldn’t able cherry-pick much uncertainty scientific article. seems they’ve already admitted clue headline accurate. Yeah sure rampant Iowa right now. Like guy said, essentially numbers game. trial group (getting real shot) control group (getting placebo shot) instructed live lives normal. people selected study get either high risk job risky lifestyle. study much interested enrolling people whose daily lives give risk exposure. time signed job census worker, going inside buildings talking strangers day long, would wear masks. job ended last month take public transit lot, many roommates, travel across state lines.

The study enrolling think 40,000 people total, massive number, easy see trial group infected less control group. control group trial group people high risk stuff, groups compared - data ultimately may thrown since lifestyle particularly risky. (Of course always useful side effects. I'm exposed, useful virus prevention part).  news. kids son's high school football team avoided testing costs. None wanted known guy got football cancelled.

I'm Massachusetts, saw first wave head on, stalled hundred cases day summer, we're rising 'second' wave going third. 
As whole, US seen two bursts cases going third... whether state goes along not, depends state's gov't's actions plans... rising tide raises ships one though. I'm defending it, per se, I'm defending views perspectives scientists within it. find amusing unable reconcile fact findings contradict assumptions. Went Gatlinburg Tennessee Florida THOUSANDS people walking strip masks on, literally left vacationed woods. well good news you! ones implemented policy far. satisfied accomplished? 


Rights supposed end others begin, seems like responsible states punished deal fallout irresponsible states. Disagree ""we know that.""

Many scientists pushing herd immunity 6 months ago precisely know long term immunity thing specific virus. political strategy anything ever suggested scientists country. must Westmoreland County. I'm sorry hear people refusing testing hiding results. help anyone.

Edit: typo Completely agree. wanted provide context. America #1. date men. Wow, craziness, happen put kids online charter school. Sure, Macron sucks ass Christian locking since March. find lot things distasteful typical American representation Christianity, I've never embarrassed throughout pandemic. fundamental tenet Christianity sacrifice benefit others, especially deserve it, seemingly lost 2020.

I zero interest aligning stereotypical American Christians, align Christ. lot still do, hear them, they're quietly manning food pantries helping sick elderly. support Dr. Fauci saying, life danger! can't imagine people trying kill even now. mean, people GOP advocating ""things"" vs Democrats/anyone disagree with. hope family stay safe, he's already made many sacrifices.

And ask anybody would skeptical this? think chose wrong article pose liberal generalization. Also, clear, liberals believe science regardless presence Reddit many us still use brains enough understand scientists sometimes make weird claims. example, redacted CDC studies claiming masks ineffective preventing spread COVID-19. work Walmart, maybe 10% people come store wearing mask. even local mask mandate nobody really gives shit here. feel like we're breaking new records every day dont want begin debate definition success. subjective, baseless debate.

We’re getting doses agreed upon conjunction countries involved probably closer hundred thousand doses given population. given vulnerable front line workers. 

We’ll first getting allocated doses fucking vaccine made here. made Germany they’d first world get quota

 entire Republican Party stopped pray scold everyone praying him, flu Depending were, masks mandatory indoors. Québec least country spent last months shitting literally everything, taking away qualified immunity sued anything.. wonder they’re proactive opening liability masks.

And it’s quite false equivalency say masks drunk driving. Thank response. 

Say put elderly sick quarantine instead everyone healthy individuals go day? Would work? problem country. see positive say fuck fellow countryman find joy pain others. 

And somehow think good guy I'm hopeful people get hint stop posting ""Look me, good!"" comments every covid related thread. Always remember, Ben Carson literally genius geniuses comes brain surgery. guy fucking savant. that, Carson incoherent opinionated babbling idiot let change tire. funny works. put much hope facemasks.

I Czech, weve mandate one half month. went 500 cases day 15k cases day that.

Everyone around experiencing spiking cases, even mask mandates. best estimates lagging behind us 14 days. really much magic solution hoped ...or, example pure stupidity &amp; ignorance like Louisiana yesterday republican elected officials trying away coronavirus precautions (which call “restrictions”)...in height f*ing Pandemic. 

Some people true IDIOTS. “I guess missed cdc releasing fact 80 percent positive cases people wore mask .”

And guess missed reading entire CDC release cherry-picked excerpt idiot posted facebook 😣

The study’s findings that, group testing Covid-positive, one thing common ***they eaten dine-in restaurant within two weeks prior testing positive***.

The study parenthetically mentioned cohort ***claimed wore masks public*** (obviously) ate restaurant public, ergo: wearing masks.

The point study eating dine-in restaurants high-risk areas community spread. Nah, I'll pass cultural thing political thing. America anti-science, people listen facts. Mandates going change anything entirely upper middle class people experience. Working class folks legit struggling childcare generally really want make things work however to, keep everyone safe, etc. Wealthy folks think world bend will. see people reluctantly wear masks, use time bathroom take one looking.

Same worry people planes. airline may tell wear mask entire flight, measures taken verify happening time? Come on, Americans get behind making people get ID vote. Americans love oppressive rules enforced heavy handedly. different? course, getting cold sort thing evenings. ;-) know we'll ever get total lockdown NEVER admit wrong.

I agree mask mandates can't federally. also agree states barring people states without mask mandates entering condition... that's lot roads block. governor South Dakota put ""update"" virus. made clear still understand asymptomatic people spread virus. like even election anything, even she'd win matter republican. insane figure this. weird bet future national politics? make sense? we’ve rounded turn pleasure.

Thank appreciate this. really one paying it. really radical belief? mean can't afford poor sex. Close legs, stop sleeping around, get job, pay choice birth control.

This notion seems reasonable seems make sense surface. like concluding bowling ball fall faster golf ball bowling ball heavier.  ideas seem reasonable initially, fall apart start dig deeper details, science, socioeconomic circumstances around them. meant insult way. topic fairly complicated lot moving parts easily spotted without help. 

Over last 20 years come understand sex intimacy important well-being nutritious food clean air water. considered luxury. telling people ""Close legs stop sleeping around"" effective telling starving person stop stealing food.

The fact matter choice paying someone else's birth control not. real choice paying birth control paying burden society unwanted children contribute to. paying either way, data shows paying much less chose pay birth control.

Personal responsibility great notion foster people, need recognize limitations. pandemic shown us, problems face society (disease, poverty, abortions, homelessness, climate change) require collectivist solutions overcome. recognizing ant tackling together pooling individual resources improve lives less fortunate, lives well higher percentage population able productively engage society. need get head checked don’t know live live poorer inner city schools best academic achievements accreditation’s rich upper class schools filled nothing snotty little brats zero ambition life. goal returning normal, I’m bare minimum putting security theater.

It's lost idiot career politicians. threw pandemic plans jumped lockdown train.

A real focused. Transparent approach would worked best. said thing seatbelts get fined don’t wear seatbelt road decide right thing? Even US adopt Swedish style approach wasn’t government intervention, there’s way hell hit 2 million fatalities. virus isn’t deadly enough!! part kills old people pre-existing medical conditions. 

Because outrageous prediction, president actually believes responsible saving lives 1.775 million people!! fatality models done harm good nothing induce fear. time projection fails even come close, people fail heed warnings public health experts. predictions pointless straight fear mongering! Don’t go. Fuck him. That’s irresponsible callous hell. fines and/or jail time offered punishment, might opposite effect make people comply less instead more. Plus already negative sentiment police adding mask enforcement punitive measures would make things worse.  see 95% America way know there’s deadly virus fact constantly told deadly is. people actually experiencing deadly virus instead told it. fact people need tested multiple times know ignoring people gotten flu every year. reality doesn’t line we’re told sensible person see propaganda used fear tactic. people like illusion safety fine. don’t cry there’s food shortage you’re lose home gigantic transfer wealth guise covid 19 allowed. People virtuous want online it’s actually effects Speeding illegal, dangerous others around you. get fine lose license get enough tickets. many people still speed? speed? lie. speed. 

Speeders like people wear mask wear chin diaper. setup speed trap mask trap, bet people wear masks fear enforcement, still going ton people flouting mandate authority around enforce it. 

People change fast, many years taken get people wear seat belts stop smoking. long periods time lot effort change public behavior year. Ignoring fact think men ones always want sex. Birth control convenient women puts control bodies. require depend male provide contraception, protects something bad happen like coercion rape. women helps menstrual cycle health related issues. aren't, let's stay realistic here. chart showing vaccinated virus vs. one isn't. help much. mortality rate would higher new virus well flu deaths counted much covid deaths. 

By deadly mean chances killing catch biggest issue anti-maskers, cloth-maskers. Hear out. isn’t peer-reviewed evidence cloth masks work. contrary, many peer-reviewed studies show cloth masks ineffective lot cases increase infection risks. fabric store nice little viral payloads get transferred around direct contact, actually increase time virus hangs around air splitting larger droplets smaller ones. 

Hospitals know this, allow doors cloth mask. That’s make trade proper surgical mask entering. 

Now look population. Less 1% people refuse wear masks. hand, 80-90% wearing cloth-masks. really wanted improve public health, would educate people dangers cloth mask.  think might meant rousing coroners. Thanks clarifying, makes sense. super fun job asking police officer please approach without putting mask on. glad worked &amp; result violence, *what hell.* accusing someone else virtue signaling, virtue signaling! Curious.  Define spike versus wave please general rule, whenever two predictions related pandemic give conflicting dates, always pick later one. Exactly. honestly say I’ve never seen cop use blinker, yet still give tickets. speed without lights occasionally blow red lights, busting others it. It’s easy money issue mask mandate. First mask mandate safer.

Then stay home mandate working safer.

Then another shutdown, save lives. 

Just anything stop lives indefinitely. people justify “hoax” it’s American problem? Genuinely curious. Case count means literally nothing aside we've known along: thing spreads incredibly easy. shows probably right 10% world could infected brings death rate more. 

There stopping this. correct, states rights exist reason though. nurses allowed speak? thought suppression speech full force nowadays. Probably. said 'cardiac arrest' given first got sick wife treated country COVID unexpected heart attack, seems likely. We're bumpkins. there’s confirmation sight hope? don’t care. That’s shitty reason enforce law fucking pandemic. wOn’T aBlE eNfOrCe AnYwAy. throwaway account hell talking about. low karma people like downvote comment rather come actual good argument it.

Raich, Supreme Court said constitutional broad view Commerce Clause. think view broad, O'Connor Thomas, read [parts dissenting opinions Yeah, HFR legitimately going down. many people go hospital die, even hospitalization numbers spring, expect many deaths.

But that's still rough road, hospitalized, means really good. hospital sucks, exposes illnesses hospitals. would nice overflowing, allow things like non-essential surgeries things like cancers go on. Utopia. see keep winning :) It’s unwise wait vaccine, almost certainly available spring. shit. boils blood can't say shit watching entitled pricks ignored mandates I'm work. great irony is, time see work fucking go store since buy stuff I'm done store. mean think March style one (i.e. everything closed cannot go out) within 2 weeks *THIS* respond conspiracy fail see mandate fine would constitutional. think would hold court. also think going hard time convincing law enforcement actually enforce mandate anyhow. There's way strategy work legal framework United States. Assuming “let’s get tested” thing sprang since school started haven’t enough weeks spread widely older people die. (It takes 5 weeks average someone die.) fear! Thanksgiving around corner! Grandparents everywhere catching thing. I'm really wondering think that. know US pretty big dumbass population, Canada, yet masks became mandatory pharmacy work saw rate mask-wearer go I'd say around 30% 100% overnight. real police enforcement.

I'm kinda blown away top comments articles always opinion. really believe almost everyone country refuses follow laws? convinces 40% people, least better? I'm really confused seem oppose this. ever say anything March later found incorrect? complete hypocrisy. bring Trump saying big deal back then, he's piece shit bigot. Fauci said basically thing ""Well things change, static problem!"" Ok, first laughed, that's kinda job decades. looked case serious. Oops. No, free public testing county. mail test convenient still free insurance. probably uninsured people would still pay $120 don’t want deal going public testing site don’t one nearby. Texas 29 million people compared Utah 3 million, think definitely plays it. Regardless, none us winning game 😔 Scary Everyone blaming colder weather, etc hush it. Canada seems fine. N95 95%. testing level bad population level, Uruguay much better testing, completely inadequate infection levels. Countries higher infection rates need testing proper contact tracing. irrelevant discussion deals US US service industry. bugger off. Pence: ""Uh, Beavis, maybe wear masks?""
Trump: ""Shut Butthead."" current trends, 200k+ dead end December. Parents flew England back. I’ll tell redditor said didn’t Preventing people socialising closing businessesses akin speeding fines. latter common sense deterrent dangerous driving, goes basic human nature (NOT comment efficacy stating nature restrictions) . 

Can see people get fatigued also increasing fines unlikely much? People *literally* need social interaction remain functional. No, absolutely objectively wrong. way exterminate virus completely then. Guaranteed still exist earth date. cops ive seen don’t wear masks could rely enforce mandate? yes mandate state cops actually usually ones see without masks public. going away dont worry... vaccine tomorrow dont worry...

All idiots electing looser dumb mean choice.

You’re right. Business compliance would 100%. successful people know motivation. know people done amazing things really wanted to. School help, thing. US never travel anywhere else world ever again.

Im downplaying covid

Sweden back peddling ots strategy watch Fox ""News"" doctors asking political party affiliation dispensing drugs combat virus/symptoms? continue ask question election? fear mongering nonsense suddenly stop magically? use Google Scholar want academic papers.  agree Germany better job tracing, also agree proving sufficient.

There winter. hope vaccine news continue good. might save some. I’m allowed opinion? call bullshit numbers!! Personally think estimating deaths high order keep public focused practicing social distancing. It’s good strategy way, nothing fear propaganda don’t think we’ll hit number.

I seem remember supposed 2 million fatalities 2020 obviously model produced incorrect results!! It’s prediction anyway means nothing big scheme things get fucking high horse!! “It is” -President Orange Taint  Little issue mask mandate folks wear one anyway? best-faring state US 50% cases Finland, per capita. already restricted bars restaurants (-50% capacity, must close early, provide adequate cleaning). Masks mandatory, strongly recommended. everyone wearing masks I've seen. ever. numbers keep going up. summer though, one wearing masks, numbers went down. kind shit guys trying pull think people eyes?

Depression thing know people think stop spread airborne, highly infectious disease lockdown? 

Do people want lockdowns? destroy people's livelihoods, credit, force foreclosures, bankruptcies, disease even deadly? 

38 percent United States deaths nursing homes - keep lockdown, civil society. 

What happened flatten curve? thought temporary lockdown avoid overwhelming hospitals? stay lockdown there's vaccine now? there's literally 0 cases country? 

If COVID extremely low death rate non nursing home patients, can't live modified life avoid lockdown, people want stay home, can? Hmm... SBT? 

Sexual Breathing Transmission. think that's best first. There's much disinformation masks coming even appointed (not Congressionally confirmed) WH spokesman, Dr. Atlas. Twitter actually remove anti-mask post disinformation. flat said work last couple weeks.

Sure crackpots want make scenes stores airports, 95% population generally complying effect. Hard live you’re dead. know “generalization” means? It’s criticizing individual person actions (which would say did). 

It making negative assumptions/statements entire group people based actions few, vice versa: negatively judging individual solely membership within larger identity group (as did). That's correct. Federal government cannot mandate masks. individual states can. Federal government twist arm State governments mandate masks (like reduce funding public roads state state mandates masks). doubt, portion people are, capable fair share damage, like infected region body may mostly healthy, areas infection bad enough damage create serious problems whole body

As someone lives area anti mask people virus deniers, say areas gonna get deserves, expense many good innocent people People asked wear masks pre-symptomatic transmission, lot super-spreader events happened infectious person feeling perfectly fine, time fell sick next day late. pretty unique feature Covid: means everyone pretend sick, might be.

This really required influenza. Pre-symptomatic transmission happen sometimes flu too, rare. Staying home wear mask feel sick good enough. Yes spending effort attention that. caring much trying safe. riskier. Sweden's deaths also likely underreported. let many infected old people die care homes without trying help survive. appear statistics never taken hospital tested. think keeps spreading people staying it? Good you. right thing context. numbers meaning unless context.

that chart shows normal death rates every country world. used comparison year help people understand changes happened.

a silly example would andre giant lost 10 pounds bowel movement compared olympic swimmer lost 10 pounds. saying someone lost 10 pounds nearly useless unless know starting end points. chart shows sweden (and every country world) started far death rates go. I’m afraid breaking record become new trend fall that’s case, overreacted closing economy, instituting mask mandates, restrictions events capacity. 

If common diseases comparable death rates ruined many people’s lives livelihoods nothing. They're bad questions though. realize right? He's asking percentage, that's loaded question. answer percentage, answer low reasonably possible, whatever may cure vaccine. Asking ""what vaccine never comes"" less one year pandemic, vaccines generally take minimum least year become available public, excusing playing precautions small possibility we'll never get vaccine. 

When say I'm playing game him, he's asking bad questions intention win argument despite wrong. literally dumbest fucking thing I've ever read. That's saying quite bit. Ideally numbers would low healthy people getting recovering good long stay home recover. means can't carry easily. lieing! argue speed limits, many places near speed limit frankly high, nobody drives fast speed limit. Thats pretty much tsunami isnt it? Lol guys heads quarantined far asses even try. Logistically, manage get way high horse?

For shame. Let's vote out! ✊🏻 There’s lotta COVID deniers “skeptics” daily threads. 27F Fargo, 29 Grand Forks, 26 Bismarck, 25 Minot, 20 Dickinson, 22 Williston. temps definitely gonna force gatherings indoors. That's gotta play role this, there's least 4-5 months weather left. I'm convinced Sturgis plays much role ND, since happens part SD almost 150 miles ND, bars open amidst sure help either. fatality rate? media sensationalism? certainly glad hired someone rip sod front yard january. probably 2,000 sqft garden work attempt growing fruit veg among flowers.

By I’d already purchased half trees wanted - others specialty enough either get bare root specimens get mom help since collection native seeds plants wanted hard find/expensive buy. many bulbs - like less typical stuff, ship well.

 raising enough feed us exclusively, it’s nice go impulsively pick chard, kale, cabbage broccoli add dinner occasionally. done Mortality rate isolation, 2018 (!) World Bank link shows, says nothing. need look excess mortality 2020 compared equivalent period recent 5 years want analyse impact COVID-19. Actually, common diseases caused comparable death rates (the various recent pandemic flus), indeed infected millions matter months (ditto). give happy malarky.

And say develop vaccine speed unheard history vaccine-development covid *special*?

If believe crap nice bridge I'd like sell you. none signage actually says cover mouth, says cover face see plausible deniability feigned compliance That's really bad considering ND population 762k people.

For example, population scaled PA's population, would 15k new cases. whereas person sleeps around sheer pleasure

Weird seem assume poor = promiscuous. 

You married poor get pregnant. Hell, married poor get IUD, prescription birth control. marriage license $50. poor married couples supposed celibate? Intimacy important relationship.

I'm glad open new information points view. That's rare see online. People begging street South Africa bring US politics. cool. numbers looking like Michigan - 2k day 20 deaths. I’ve read usually takes 2-3 weeks see death counts sadly go up. doesn’t good course! percent positive dipped 6.7 percent still remains remained flat 1,182 patients hospitals representing drop 1 30 deaths reported, bringing total 4,144.  hate smooth-brained take things. people careful, following mandates deserve COVID? Nobody calls “Parliament” (proper noun). said patient ends ICU can't help better first wave.

So policy help everyone, hospitals overrun focus ICU. Local state police compelled enforce federal law/mandate either. national mask mandate may make compliance even worse. No, decent humans def capable that. problem that. people know. No, don’t. rarely see anyone ever inside stores without masks - know places actively enforce it. 

I suspect universal rate mask usage - seems vary greatly location, even neighborhood (the places noticed people without masks tend area). 

It would interesting see total US mask wearing stats, although much doubt we’ll get (or do, data reliable/representative). death rate remaining low? Unfortunately probably happen lot people die... mandate empathy US mean we're relying herd immunity? Yeah 1.5million 2 million sweet spot. say nothing confirmed reinfection worse. would take integrity, morals, responsibility. none those. oppose abortion you’d also supporting planned parenthood free contraception. clearly don’t. 

Sounds like want someone look upon. US full people really good refusing see reality.  Many train groups weekly keep practice. New *record daily 10-20 years large percentage population going cancer regardless happens virus.

There reason worry cancer 30 years now, add much stress life. 

We going experiencing large chunk population issues disease regardless. amount mental anguish that's already placed age groups. amount agoraphobics we'll years. mention people sunk alcohol drug dependency throughout this. people live life grief see dying loved one death.

My god effects virus felt decades. need add fear heart problem mix know much yet. Agreed. Great job clarifying original comment. think problem masks, like abortion, became political. happens logical thinking goes window. Even would never favor something, even bother truly thinking instead wait orders tribe. probably done purpose nothing rallies people side hating side. support something we, without hesitation, must hate said thing. feel left chose wrong stance abortion right took wrong stance masks. case harm overly cautious. Keeping distance masks important personally feel safer cleaning packaging handled numerous times delivered 😊 fact say president said democratic hoax ruins credibility completely. never said that. India getting close, US clearly committed keeping title. Masks mandated March. better late never. France mandatory mask policy yet 160k new cases per day 92% deaths elderly people serious coexisting diseases like cancer agree lied first even stigmatized mask wearing. even said wouldn’t work. remember 180 switch “wear mask” made feel weird like people judging mask on. said wear mask.

[You virus ""perfectly harmless"" people. 

That true seem think ""recovery"" exact thing ""no adverse effects"" seem care people see point continuing thread.

The argument taking precautions ""someone else might die"". strong enough motivator told need know you. lack empathy. comment nobway supported citations ill give benefit doubt amd let try again.

Republican politicians, Police Sheriffs encouraging places violate shutdown orders hate governor. 40+ others face felony charges standing sidewalks protesting civil rights.  feel like are. Look. I'm saying masks work, possible enforce mandate like that. 
If 8 months ""WEAR MASK!!! Wear fucking mask DIE!!!!!! literally killing GRANDMA!!!!!!"" People still wear them? Maybe time think different strategy. 

Why people insist harping one thing actually going work enough people demand mandate. Sheesh..

Listening trumps rhetoric combined winter arriving sending people indoors makes believe otherwise I’d agree hadn’t working retail 8 months pandemic. first 2 months accurate, quickly turned around. bars Los Angeles basically open again, albeit outside. chin diapers, social distancing, etc. Tell it, baby May, pregnancy/new mom brain already messes perception time...I legitimately remember divide things “pre-baby lockdown” “post-baby lockdown” still misplace things memory never shut work health department? Oh well, guess I'm living altered state; simulation sorts. comment necessary. Remember China's recalculation added 14k one day? Dr. Rick Bright testified House subcommittee May ""without better planning, 2020 could darkest winter modern history."" Well, deal face face every day he's specialized surgeon, ER doctor. even say that. He's still medical professional, though religion/politics/lunacy trumps medical training. Pun intended lol. neurosurgeon coworker (Mormon think) also believes hoax, he's alone. Hopefully BS remains limited personal beliefs leak medical practice. not, need reported medical board. Trust me, perplexed you. read book dean koontz, says covid disappear child looked violent, often. also several consumers house would things quite disturbing, regardless loved deserve nothing love. choose born way were, choose housed shit conditions.

All 1 top 20 current worst states Republican voting. cannot believe hoping finally replaced praying Poland. prays help? live US Canada looking really nice right ngl. country full sooo many idiots, ones running show following. . .were screwed never said that. see need them. Protect people need/want protecting let rest us go lives. bs numbers. risk flying much much higher that. It’s 100% related spread virus city flying from. ‘study’ total garbage. Yeah, ""western world"" is, culture geographical position 76 million doses? many Canadians there? Doomsday cults always botch date stay cult regardless Hah! Number One list enlisting celebrities. said day one. need record commercials, go talk shows, discuss airing tv shows, talk getting news, remind us after, too. argument began commenter arguing two possibilities: lockdowns + people going broke + riots; lockdown (+ people going broke + riots that's different discussion I'll get back to).

My point simple. people pose rhetorical dilemmas like OC done, committing false dichotomy errors: usually (almost always) two options. case here. problem duality: options original commenter ignored, *one which* compensating people stay home. 

And comes paying people stay home, practically infinite number options so, mundane like levying property taxes high value first homes, eliminating multitude tax credits currently offered builders, cutting spending number areas, getting loans ECB, emergency QE, imploring monetary zones covid Marshall plan, going euro altogether, *a million possibilities* around.

Now, doubt argue *literally none ways possible*.

But going advance argument *literally third option,* burden proof show options considered *impossible* (not politically difficult).

As first point, OCs implicit premise lockdowns cause economic hardship, maintaining status quo impact economy, bunk. Allowing virus spread control roughly equivalent economic impact locking country. cases, tourism effectively stops, discretionary spending effectively stops, widespread business school closures due mass illnesses, non-essential businesses many essential businesses lose money shutter, etc.

Except one scenario, addition hardship, lot people get sick die. end, irrespective protestations, still lot easier print distribute money resurrect dead. thread locked 3... 2... 1... Geographically Australia NZ literally far ""west"" go, they're east Asia. downhill spiral. like domestic terrorism, starter pack problem argument, it'll never officially promoted, higher ""real"" numbers March, earlier push date first real domestic case, 200k daily cases April guarantees first case well pre-date first case Wuhan.

This creates big political problem, imagine. Insanity. Absolute insanity. 

Primary secondary? USA USA NUMBER 1 ! .. wait moment..... worth 20x less

Which would make multibillionaire? aren’t working fucks think it’s suppression rights. We’ve turned coronavirus NASCAR race.  Funny. pseudo intellectual citation FDA impressive.

Have ever basic lab? University level chemistry 101? Dilution factor 10 means nothing. suggest apparatus detection limits viral loads can't handle mere dilution factor 10? 

Yes, greater INSIGNIFICANT likelihood false negatives. method pooling works well low prevalence, EFFICACY ECONOMIC. positives means less retesting entire 10 people associated diluted sample needs tested narrow who's actually positive.

Yes, continue ignoring lessons Asia (including China) something simple like pooled testing needs propagandized skepticism. Go back school.

I get P.Eng. nothing. Many Americans die idiots like you. wherever come from. bad many innocent, still breathing perpetuating pseudo intellectual bullshit keeps virus alive. heard physiotherapists already call Long Covid new polio. prevented deaths matters lot imo. He’s it, don’t care now, crow That's wild. reminds lot Florida. First screamed lockdown. got sick it. spike, everyone stayed home fear. we're back dining parties, experiencing slow upward curve. 

How quickly forget. I’d worried economic implications lasts long personally knew airborne beginning February. People mad. super early January cases. red Reddit told friends. thought bonkers. came Germany friends thought wizard knowing early. . get wrong. stumbled accident different world discovered subreddit early know also. lucky stumble it. trying say somebody like browses internet information early every world leader sure already knew. act it.

Careful tho subreddit absolut shit days China bashing trolls. disagree China, sure hiding lot stuff subreddit literal trolls days can't recommend. Amen. I’m pregnant severe asthma teaching 250+ kids per week elementary school, still wear one every day day. guys copy Sweden, don’t lock down, ‘avoid contact anyone outside immediate family’  US gonna unintentionally go herd immunity let's go also went dr told didnt covid.  video reminded way back day simply certain would never see president less intelligent George W.

My apologies Dubya... we're cool, bro. Wouldya? Alright, whose next? did. 

since statement *Sweden comparatively worse it’s peers* *Only Italy higher death rate per capita* perfectly fine comparing Sweden it’s peers including Italy others. US world leader. militarily technologically. Culturally politically perceived ethical high ground. world looked US. failed state. fallen empire. Cletus deplorables worthy pity even inflict death blow.

The biggest asshole ever. Trumps Tremendous Vaccine? Boy, Belgium 2nd place terms Deaths / million 926.98 deaths / million house passed MAY. republicans senate wouldn’t even vote it. 

If real president would made happen. 

The house recently passed new version. exactly you’re looking for. idea senate vote not, suggest call senator ask support HEROES act. Convex course. lips god’s ears. MAGAing yet? thats less thought based news, thank explaining. 
it seems similar approach Sweden one exception - lockdown helped lot early stage. assumption correct?
i still curious people social distance office buildings without masks. seems working far, hope figures dramatically grow growing elsewhere. Wait, mean wearing masks opening schools school sports bad idea? Noooooooooooo. went April said way hell we'd 50,000 deaths month.

April 1st -- 6,466 deaths   
April 30th -- 65,201 deaths AOC hysterical laugh tempered less crazy laugh? Many wastewater treatment facilities filter inactivate prescription medications. Firefighter Paramedic here. day I'll sick. killed twice many people 65 group last 9 months flu entire year. someone lives developing (I doubt that), high-population nation shit hit fan lax governance ineffective control measures , tell people least ridicule virus, belittle effects. people appalled US people made joke negating good work community trying put in, still support idiots power. mean, rich, structured community loophole idiots anti-intellectuals thrive? part, US always retained semblance common sense others. Sad true: anymore, maybe never was, except coincidentally. **INCOMPETENT** Yes. Rounding first corner, lap 1 one NASCAR races. covid? Lmao watched clip Canadian (?) guy sprayed hand sanitizer paper cup coffee (with holes) curbside pickup there's vaccine right around corner! Trump said would election! occasionally play lottery, always social distance wearing mask barely ever leave house. live New Brunswick, Canada, population similar North Dakota landmass smaller. total 324 cases 3 deaths since began. North Dakota 36,000 cases 440 cases. absolutely blows mind. True. that’s mobilization federal level. wasted opportunities get control. it? Defund police give laws enforce? There’s hope anymore...   already signed six contracts tens millions vaccine doses pharmaceutical giants, AstraZeneca, Moderna Pfizer. told, federal government secured 358 million doses COVID-19 vaccine — insurance policy vaccines development prove ineffective clinical trials.

Smart investment. Well 2% Americans *already have* COVID. anything ratio low. Attitude doesn’t change reality, perception it. There’s hope, virus going forever Wow wtf. people tell others someone super close contact awaiting test results?

Its happening again.

Hope okay! Luck = preparation + opportunity long MAGAman tries claim prevented second wave simply single, devastating ongoing wave? “They say I’m broken record every time break record” mail order groom Korea? Well that’s been. result several days' worth data collated released once...? Seems hard believe. Thats completely inaccurate. We've given every warning could possibly given experts. act certainly Biden win election remainder year first half next year make 2020 look like cakewalk. whole country could collapse. people dont like anything goes narrative Cant let people fun peace ? church 1/2 block house, holding regular Sunday services. attendees observed (by me) coming going without masks - giving benefit doubt, maybe put inside? However, unlikely, considering stickers adhered vehicles. Also, banner tied side handicapped railing churches back entrance says, “Jesus 2020” (seriously). first time hospital (er, except born suppose) last April, really sick 8 days. Back April super thankful last year year.

I friend stroke late February. hospital like 2 months rehab month that, coma (not sure medically induced even strictly coma completely it) like first three weeks.

He's great now, got cleared drive recently. said super surreal, totally unaware going trying explain wife family visit, going COVID, idea became huge deal April still hospital pretty inwardly focused healing. feel like it’s 3rd wave Unfortunately, clock ticking, hours going by. past increases, future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.

&amp;#x200B;

( ) understand

&amp;#x200B;

( ) Remain ignorant sick winning yet? America stand France going win clear first second third wave please stop cringy reddit shit Lol 100+ week. Winning! know South America South Africa going Australia due strict lockdown high compliance, contact tracing mandatory masks generous stimulus payments people forced work. Calling seasonal seems cheapen efforts. remember reading countless articles original sars pandemic finally ended hopeful many things would happen (borders closed, lockdowns). I, think bunch people time, preparing lockdowns seemed like sensible outcome inevitability. 

I remember reading covid almost every night starting sometime January (I think? Long left china) already fascinated pandemics listening End World podcast.

It odd mix fear hope subreddits (with unfortunate addition racism conspiratorial thinking occasion). anyone around back attest general consensus ""There lockdowns US"" many posts comments prepare things. went little overboard opinion guides get water event treatment plants shut down, something never thought going happen. 

Anyway, anyone back thought would ""disappear"" say, probably expecting mass lockdowns border closures. None seemed ever really happen, least extent could potentially ended problem. 

I think everyone also realistic sense knowing likely already late given that, time, much known asymptomatic spread numbers coming china trusted many. still hope, like said. Step 1. Get fuck sub

Step 2. Close Reddit

Step 3. Turn device

Step 4. Go outside breathe fresh air Perhaps future don’t make comments subject informed? agree lying.... wear mask around son home 2 days prior finding ex hiding issue side. believe guy house around son nearly vigilant. thought waiting results test home would least told brought son like normal. feel like see phrase everyday assured President going away can’t true. Unless sort anti science fact moron. ...oh wait. God damnit. theory people understood pandemic meant, needed done short term. long term, adjusting, everything else unknown required leadership, leadership never came most.

The plane fire shut engines, pilots just... walked away stick gossiped passengers. We're number 1! We're number 1!  problem! saw concept like 10 years ago ems conference. becoming economically friendly 

I think Allen FD (TX) one interviewed man saved it- walking fire station thank guys. major brain damage full motor function Cringe af bruh understand people still nation-wide shutdown, *very* least mask mandate. can't afraid economy collapsing everything going shit, **it already is** right now! hemorrhaging. Slowly bleeding out. One step forward, two large steps back. Anytime get grasp somewhere, pops somewhere else. friend who's mother came contact someone later tested positive. friend one careful intelligent people know, going insane trying keep track mother went, come contact son, else family saw, time frames everyone needs consider. zero faith average American could trusted this. I've gotten tested twice. Negative times, thankfully, first time took 3 weeks get results back second took 5 days. cases, I'd passed 14 days since exposure getting results back. YMMV. Noooooo lame stop already Everyone watch this, it’s amazing!!! Learn CPR people, Heimlich plan kids. Rounding corner said. didn’t think would become political, Trump would screw bad people would stupid No. difference Norway's Sweden's measures overblown. similar different. Whoever responsible needs fired Right mayors governors practically tears begging people social distance, reduce contacts, wear masks, clearly people aren’t listening everyday goes fewer people are...

...and today broke records. ""You know, lot people think goes away April heat — heat comes in. Typically, go away April"" Trump saying moronic propaganda intended create false consensus never there. believe N. Dakota Dakota crazy governor seem care covid-19 whatsoever. know nutballs go Michigan governor leave alone someone whose leadership direct correlation people dying. could again. 

But apparently 14 days home everyone cause end world something.  World leader lead everything  always rounding corner circling drain... knew would get relatively big US thought would mostly large cities, would get contained spread nationwide, impacting Americans. foolish.

No not. live China back February parents asked whether US OK(my uncle aunt lives US), spend half hour give lecture US never get point Wuhan , worst scenario NYC got 10,000 cases total neighbour states get couple hundred cases, people US even feel thing. Pretty much blueprint countries followed. expected would unveil amazing contact tracing technologies collaboration biggest tech companies + govt, mandate larger nationwide lockdown/mask mandate, provide universal payments affected economic factors shutting everything. things like force people positive stay one place legal penalty, instead ""suggest quarantine"" remember watching videos posted discussing person collapsed street throwing blood bleeding head. Wow. ex reason can't get thing control, infuriating. hope you, girlfriend, son ok ❤️ least America #1 something look overall mortality hardly difference nordic countries, 2020 turning pretty average year.

You assuming ""dead covid"" would died soon anyway, numbers suggest all.

Some stats   Um... Better someone who's care. Crying appropriate response things, like this. March 12th wife got knee surgery. back base ever since. happening opened schools  Fuck grandparents.  SPEEDRUN pretty much Japan doing. working! NEWSFLASH: Anti Vaxx Flat Earthers accidentally move goal posts edge planet... Better emotionally unstable emotionally constipated. tired. hope so, point.  I'm ears man. single mom... sounds right. Although mom keeps kids home wear masks. Got link dem dresses? Wait till tomorrow. trying edgy anything, bout fact China claims around many cases total despite population 1.3 billion? won’t forget men died Yo dawg, heard like waves Yeah, dilemma gets me. much may want know contacts gotten sick covid protect myself, others, think back every single ""temporary"" invasion public's privacy note literally became permanent. 

I want government knowing exactly I'm Orwellian backdoor, impunity cos ""for safety"". want that, forced risk jobs skulk around dark it. That’s awesome! Keep keeping on! long tight lockdowns don’t work capitalist society

TIL Argentina capitalist New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.. initiates sacred sciences passed time Egypt Greece. Even BCs knew much. guess work secret methods today unaware of.  seeing hospital bill.

180 days 1million+, die 30 minutes. funniest damn thing read today, laughed ass never Reddit. rounding corner onto oncoming traffic 10 Mac trucks q imagine high real number millions people work need job right now. source reasonably accurate, though delays reporting various countries means far perfect: deaths Europe (there's handy continent filter top big table) two days ago (you go back 2 days) 1798. 

Russia, France, Spain, UK, Poland, Czechia Ukraine ones seeing 100 deaths per day right now. understand it, Czechia starting run limits medical capacity - hopefully working bringing right now. think plenty times he's lied, something like 20,000 saw somewhere. I'm going that, feelings much. 

The guy high risk age weight, must've exposed high viral load rallies, gets well days? call bullshit. Yuck that's awful. Let lockdowns begin suppose. like alcoholics never hung cuz they're always drunk  knew tradition pretending Im home opening doors holloween would come big one day. rounding like it. Yeah, went grocery shopping supply two person household six weeks full blown house lockdown. never happened. are. Came hear say too... US downward trend twice now. mean problem solved. 

Here's hoping India continues improve. There's ""we've got idiots"", there's ""a third country base whole identity exact wrong thing order spite 2 thirds.""

The US stand chance. I've following since first week December. mid-December, knew going global pandemic started preparing. access believe patient zero US, middle aged woman came symptoms mid-December visit group Wuhan Institute Virology. appear community spread case. However, woman, whatever reason, absolutely refuses get antibody test. believe there's political motivation behind reasons seeks minimize impact virus every turn. Typical European hurbis... Thank mean counties fraction (5-10% sq km) size? like still see dumb fucks stores walking around without coughing away  “By Easter 2020” - Trump. 


Shut fuck up. Took second.. It'll gone Easter. 2022. phenomenon probably got scientific name! like reference Anaxagoras Giordano Bruno. knowledge hermetic science? ""we're rounding turn""

fuck dumbass-in-chief. look worldometers clearly see weekend testing around world drops No. watched save princess. Im anti-vax, isn’t slippery slope? “rounding corner”, don’t want know what’s around next corner. right. bad 200-300,000 people died access free experimental treatments worth half million dollars like guy paid system received care did. White House believes different realities alternate facts. Welcome Twilight Zone. Aged well Looks like didnt ""everything"" right USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 
you mean rising? cuz hospitalizations rising True, ever lie? US better world daily cases?

Trump mentioned America rounding corner. lie, would he? See tomorrow. Vote Biden sworn January 20th earliest, one thing feel positive about, [chances looking decent vaccine regulatory approval year's could keep many people dying then, would great. can't win. Damned do, damned don't. I've talked elementary principal, friend, hard decisions around since March. We're really lucky small district teachers administration staff really care kids. We're definitely rounding corner...just wrong way. Rallying happened NYC around 9/11 covid. Rest country, last time pretended time laughed.

Big difference, weren’t brown people blame time. Mortality rate estimated 0.5-0.65% 80% deaths age 65. people age 45 risk much flu. people &lt;25 equal lesser flu. Perfectly easy gauge risk based estimated 40 million people infected US based photo, wouldn’t trust clinic/lab pet goldfish 2018 state fair. mean no, it’s not. It’s pandemic, since it’s across globe. it’s talking effects PANdemic USA. forgot Greenland. Source current R0 please? doubting. I've found estimates vary widely location patient age assume factors. January February fucking great too. Went vacation 4 weeks. Feel like happened also like 5 years ago we're situation here. hear you. site pull up. Also law passed violation constitution null void part constitutional restriction upon government duty people ignore disobey ""law"" passed repugnant constitution.

Anything violates inalienable right life, freedom, property repugnant constitution therefore legitimacy country. Shit. Sorry hear that. Hopefully 2021 brings better days. 

Does sf username stand San Francisco? so, I’m bay too! actually didn’t type this. clue got here. Yeah remember really deep dive telling people back minimum 250k probably going die 2021. Everyone would always say ""you mean worldwide?"" told ""no USA"" laughed me.

And are. surprised hit half million next spring. would mean 1 600 Americans killed COVID. Ok I'm saying people acting like they're asked something ridiculous. Realistically they're asking people tell close contacts makes perfect sense economy fine now. nosedive again....further  Coronaviruses great potential mutate jump species. need look back 20 years see 3 examples. probably picked likely scenario. Shutting economy month long term damage. could re-open everything come back stronger ever. I’m orthopaedic surgery resident. Yesterday tested positive. Asymptomatic. ppl department aren’t. Yeah, got lucky. came back India ~10 days shut country down. Well honest lot choking coughing saying big deal. ya lived country capable contact tracing. Fuck dude! Wasn’t yesterday also biggest one-day? I’m boat. We’re teachers everything supposed, turns lower elementary students behavior issues (low SES area &amp; 80% students trauma related issues$ aren’t worried wearing masks. School admin didn’t listen teachers are. seen noted comments, church service. apparently organized event people country came town convocation events. becomes lot worse context USA! USA! USA!! wonder many people getting ill yet mortality rate equivalent.

Good question. take:

1. Better treatment hospitals.
2. Mostly younger people getting it.
3. Vit higher people summer.
4. Original viral load smaller due mask distancing.  Biggest one-day increase record... far. Unfortunately, soon virus started mutating, apparent even Australia get vaccine we’re stuck infecting re-infecting countries even completely clean out.

With Ebola starve kill off. airborne virus that’s contagious room someone enough, means global travel shuts permanently it’s resolved.

Here we’re hundred cases New Zealand they’ve basically killed entirely. soon one sick person arrives, it’s back again. order America move past pandemic, world collectively move past it. let everyone get infected, weak die off, strong survive (maybe weaker maybe weaker don’t know yet) Darwinism takes it’s toll.

Either way entire world together. asshole antivaxxer Venezuela could get plane New York even clear months start again. isn’t vaccine global, cheap enough people need travel take it, anyone currently either dies stays quarantine. do, I'm two biologics prednisone. high risk. 8 million 200,000 death, still fault half citizens believe bullshit. Gross link twitter. need see morons replying ""cAsEs dOnT mAtTeR"". same, actually stopped drinking post history garbage? beg differ. thanks taking time read. 😃 here. seen anyone people live since March..I've gone store like 3 times even get college grad. year horrible slowly going insane. pretty irritating see people still going hanging people putting others risk. even get jealous able fun fine...but still risk it; risk worth want put family risk. 

I can't wait till vaccine comes out. I've done part whole year basically. yeah...same Idaho sending people Salt Lake City too. multiple hospitals capacity Utah. wonder Trump said we’ve turned corner meant would sudden big spike upwards. think could've happened right leadership. Americans rally around flag like one else. like war end day mobilized scale testing make patriotic act wear masks get tested often well mobilizing workforce make masks medical equipment. Even GW Bush would've done better job. isn’t world Mmm, smell cheap companies market. Jesus would proud Funny numbers spike directly Biden shit bed debate. USA #1? social bubble   Maybe = code ""I've imploring asshats months, clear:"" places sell frozen food China sells many countres. disrespect Beavis Butthead. They’re way better Trump Pence hope someone shoves tube worthless throat someday. Grabs attention also builds brand resentment. live Texas, see everywhere. Winning one Covid deniers too? Republicans love moving goal posts It’s frustrating me, esp living CA shoebox apartment. initial lockdown weeks, businesses mostly closed 6 months, friends (mostly young people living alone) basically hermits whole time, figuring “wow, strong response hopefully keep virus spreading”. Yet ding dongs elsewhere idiots CA managed fuck up. Trump infected minds followers made mask wearing political matter. Adding national mandate would add fuel fire. path better compliance/lower infection rate Trump rest gop leadership authentically consistently campaign mask wearing, social distancing, listening science. happen we're brink annihilation. Long range EVs going huge game changer. can't plug live, car could 400+ miles charge?  could go electric.

Now afford one, lol. (They're competitive now, still price range.) En klen tröst. ☹️
I hope learned lesson break current trend make blog post obsolete. may happy Duda policies party calling "" right-wing facists"" way board. annual figure interesting one yes, September says little considering curve pointing. Still, it’s simple facts 58 675 per 100k capita (or 8,6%) contributed Covid-19. don’t really point show total deaths. That’s freedom, baby, free kill others. [6% deaths far healthy people. That’s 70 previously healthy people ( comorbidities) dying EVERY DAY. Agreed.

I 100% wear masks think mandate done long time ago, damn courts.

However agree way late.

Pretty much coworkers (if Biden wins) would ignore mandate ""because Biden"". me, that's reason.  

How smart folks abandon logic science astounds me. diseases worked past?

If memory serves, end result everyone getting measles chicken pox simply everyone got illness. viruses gone extinct due spread everyone? happened would rather have, 100% people lockdown 2 months getting immunity 15-30 age brackets much less risk vulnerable population that?

Rather stay am, covid community since April, went extinct lockdown we've kept since. understand appeal say, see realistic is. Yeah, y'all lock downs. 220k deaths ain't good thing live Texas too? sheriff said thing  think need start looking day highest deaths biggest death increase. New cases don’t mean much days. survival rate like 99%. Well knew read I’ve already told it’s lie. Failing research believing lies shows kind person are. Thank you. I'll thinking too. Tough spot tough year sure. sons best year academically home. distractions. 

There benefits. Coronabungle.

Like clusterfuck, related caused taking Covid19 seriously. death rate ""is still higher many infectious diseases, including flu,"" Horwitz says. recover suffer complications months even longer. ""It still potential harmful terms long-term consequences many people.""

Even source classifies changes silver lining, reason give fuck. blogspot site, maybe would worth looking conflict data Euromomo.

The latter shows Sweden extremely average year.  guys also got hit hard Mardi Gras early this, one knew coming. things got bad. Maybe made people Louisiana realize real kept attitudes better rest South. lmao removing posts agree lockdown hysteria alarmism Ok, Covid cured? skirting around actual point think covid still big problem there

I don’t think COVID still big problem there, also don’t trust Chinese government’s insistence it’s magically eradicated. think truth likely somewhere middle (or even lower end). another racist, uneducated American who’s never left ever leave state let alone country?

You terrible person literally zero ground stand accusing others painting gross, offensive generalizations. guess 2020 would least deadly yet ever Sweden excessive amount covid deaths (one highest world) hear Costa Rica’s nice time year. assume already suppose White House puppet whole thing. imagine Trump said today scamdemic hoax? we're lied to? Dude's obviously playing someone else's rules. Good insurance plans still make pay copays, pocket 20% treatment that. Cancer million dollar type bill. That’s around 210,000 90 days, least, able keep job hence insurance. College probably cost 3 year span ability low cost long term federal financing.  primarily attitude work. dependent new president Republican supporters like stem cells anti-Christian. Quoted work, people would think. save lives, gets people hospital faster.

Why news? said beginning justification big price. Biden awful debate, let's spike numbers even usual. many bags frozen French fries must lick get sick? Surely one contaminated bag spuds. cases low, like summer, understand attending safe, small gatherings, dining patios, etc. cases starting surge area, don’t think it’s unreasonable people put hold kinds social gatherings, especially indoors, without masks, attending multiple gatherings cause encounter many people. avoiding myself. months I’m going fall apart. It’s matter putting well-being public desires socialize. president says shit like ""Well mean I've seen lot things suggest masks work. ehhhhh Idk"" 

We're fucked America, saying “Depends ask” opinion local fact actual facts didn’t matter. America 2020 thats great theory..and missed education think would wear mask . one planet wears mask ..im obviously one conversation honest enuff notice mask aint shit. Go look outside everyone wearing mask still massive new cases..if want hide head pretend wore mask would end go right ahead ..God knows lie Lotta shit life. Nothing gonna slow thing 40 percent ppl get vaccination shot 13 15 percent non vaccinated get antibodies. go way viruses go ..a combo vaccinations, herd immunity virus mutations weakening . Btw condoms stop airborne stds ..just sayin mean even looking random graph extremely obvious Europe starting second wave virus United States started similar curve.

But time United States never seen massive decrease daily cases like Europe did. That's decide ""wave"" Europe daily cases looks like wave. Kinda like see ocean.

How would describe Europe United States similar curves everyone defining Europe going second wave.

Please remember even finished first wave.

Best way describe would getting second wave similar Europe top already existing first wave Aaaand.. zero deaths 6 months. Aaaand... Zero false positive 12M testing pool. Aaaand.. think ruling gets announced spring, hopefully he's still President.

Basically he's setting big huge mess elected blame Biden dealing shit left behind. Chinas going up. Fuxk china true Americans wait some( me) wonder happened famous words fearless leader said.. remember words ? ! are.. "" it'll go away "" ? half country infected ? belgian call reaction total failure.

First, let people go hollidays feb/mars Italy covid ragging there. let people come back without quarantine/test. 
The first wave happens, go lockdown authorities tell people wearing masks pointless.

Schools started September expected, covid cases skyrock mess. half measures, delaying inevetable lockdown. hospital capacity going maxed mid november. failed country. Similar commercials. Attention grabbing guess happened already, nobody cared cares. Houston it, NY ambulances/EMT services. really gains much growing depression nothing sit house better keep truth wraps Thanks! Fun discuss, buried not. Coming summer think expected. like rest northern hemisphere, we'll see happens next months. willful culling population creates lot job opportunities good ol' USA.

&amp;#x200B;

Its chosen people.

They education do.  proud can’t fit US. Either terrorist dumb enoughy shouldstay home. wrong chalk board. Half Uni profs US preferred white boards odd since deaths down, headlines cases? almost want afraid. cried hit 100,000 case hospitals drowning, because, ya know, can't get much worse this, right? bad, tragic, heartbreaking, turning point, it? yeah, are. wasn't. Thanks Borat 2, remember Michael Penis saying CPAC mean, Canada one admitted indoor venue without one. perspective get hard. frustrating f*ck. Georgia, parents school Facebook groups arguing kid gets sick COVID tested they're positive there's treatment anyway it'll cause people quarantine. pity mandates would even neccesary.  many depressing reasons mean per capita France absolutely US beat right state seen record 1-2 times week last month I’ll either return home stay home thanksgiving leave school semester’s over. Personally, think school run til thanksgiving last weeks remotely. It’s incredibly tough semester families Oh yeah? Take France! 

[(41,622 new cases hurr durr america bad amirite guys? like europe like western europe extreme lockdowns. would actually china's export tank, stupid crap comes there. ""It's almost like masks work""

That's deleted comment said, anyone curious. sure deleted considering confident apparently are.

Anyway, impossible conduct thorough scientific testing short timeframe. However, data promising general consensus among scientists doctors proper mask usage decreases transmission. that, scientific data always ideal, please think moment. No, really, think without trying argue (your post history suggests much masks odd reason). virus, virus exits face holes. mask covers face holes, portion virus going get caught mask, rather go environment. matter virus exits face holes gets caught mask, portion. point reduction multiplied everyone whole world wears masks properly public spaces subway, buses, stores, work, etc. That's House Representatives about, Senate. 

The founders reasons, good ones, especially given number comments like thread (unless commenter saying thing throughout). Staff already burnt out, push leave. Super perfect covid strain vaccine based upon?

Last read 8 strains kicking around.

I got one back April BC, assuming Strain A, immunity Strain A...and reason people saying immunity doesnt last, yeah...neither immunity vaccine case.

People, wear masks. It’s least society, care all. Agreed. Reddit sometimes make crack smile, one heard head actually laughed. needed. broke ass broke, I'd gild shit outta comment. feeling threatened India's recent numbers guess study garbage torn apart peer review.

Eh, ok feel free make stuff up. keep actual real world. reporting consistent day day Friday always highest reporting day week. Saturday lower, Sunday even lower things start going Monday. see another high reported cases least Wednesday; likely Thursday. many recovering? put stats alongside these?

Fuck feelings fuck you. makes smile knowing anguish feel Trump wins again. think would actually make tensions, right wing revolt civil unrest decidedly worse. imported food! important. know would suggest one better need both. Biggest issue enforcement national mandate can't enforced, must done locally. Cops refusing enforce health orders. refusing wear mask figured long time ago cops bother wearing mask. uncle insisting right moment family group chat masks dangerous. 

This rich successful Silicon Valley engineer we’re talking. 

He believes it’s political. 

What fuck do? Disinformation different willful ignorance. Disinformation authorities belligerent groups *purposely misinform public* using basic propaganda marketing techniques. 

While much public vulnerable believe want believe (covid real mitigations unnecessary) disinformation sinister manipulative. Willful ignorance *coping mechanism* gone haywire. There's gif Michael Jackson eating popcorn. me, Canadian, there's mask mandate US y’all want Trump authoritarian? Fauci removed mask huge meeting started fiddling live television? doubt virus real issue, come guys, Fauci absolute joke. He’s nothing political tool, senses word. guarantee moron doesn’t believe word he’s saying press, shouldn’t either. one said lockdown 5 years. That’s trumpism. reason hate lockdowns government wasn’t giving everyone enough money. government paying everyone living wage locked down. Stop spread stop virus.  I’m hoping, find way capitalize mask mandate might people board enforce mandate. IIRC talk potential $2500 fines people refuse wear masks could definitely deterrent however I’d comfortable person offered free mask chose refuse it, people really don’t masks. Ha ha

But none sway cause another chud areas resistance mask wearing created "" every person themselves"" situation. (Cloth) Mask wearing effective large proportion people concern protecting other. 

When there's large group selfish people poor risk assessment skills refuse wear mask, effectiveness cloth masks drops quickly. situation I'd argue need N95, even valved, rather cooperating neighbors, protect them. happen. Especially close Nov 3rd. Imagine living country virus cases uncontrollably accelerating beyond belief 3/4 states, yet respective leaders frightened anything fear reprimand frome executive branch. election important saving lives proletariat.
Hell, senate fast tracking conservative supreme court pick 2 weeks election working weekend. Yet, can't seem thing help people affected pandemic. even took 2 vacations last 6 months, big boss tells get moving, get things done. Imagine big man actually wanted help American people, could done. petulant man child. also comes medical system capacity. Sure hell area.  scary. I’ve mocked week putting mask enter store. Meanwhile 4,000 new cases day state Embrace misery Zoom now. time China talking finding viable virus frozen food. Wow. selfish. Georgia governor put declaration place July banned cities mask mandates. (He rescinded month later.) Maybe much late winter early spring people access vaccines It’s right kill family neighbors aggressively perpetuating information know false deadly. 

When become right violently selfish? quarantine, that's exactly said back February, nobody listened course.... .035% 70 / 200,000. wonder percent 70 underlying health concerns, obesity, etc..

If you’re healthy, fit college student understand overly concerned health. get societal obligation doesn’t spread risk people, calculating risk... reason mask mandate areas Everyday. 75% + people encounter masked despite state town mandate. I'm kinda pissed small administration tiny part government basically fucking entire world stupidity. Sounds like people say don’t need seatbelt they’re safe driver. Wow. Henny Penny, that’s blast past!! speed cameras highways like every technologically advanced country. license plates tied person's registration address. People get mailed speeding tickets everywhere else. 
God damn Americans limited unimaginative?   told last month CVS Minute Clinic. told live virus. must misinformed. March! October now. Clearly lot new information available virus spreads.  Also March wearing mask civilian often meant front line workers would less protection

Mask availability concern anymore.  think level knowledge regarding healthcare never changes next time sick maybe treated blood letting leeches think I'll carry on, thanks anyway room waiting lists US, we're told long wait be. breathing also spread it. Ok, do? It’s seems like nobody does. I’ve around sub 30k. know quite bit false accurate news. I’m still confused honest. Numbers holding onto hopes vaccine? It’s going work.

Edit: it’s ok scared Yes, cause wearing mask comparable giving money someone else. Stop it. situation become dire, fear even well-mannered Biden lull back bed like Obama did.  doubt ton data long term effects depending define long term. bulk infections spring, six months ago. Long term studies take time yes; assume plenty issues discovered years ahead. GF got covid summer still issues breathing meat tastes bad can’t eat anymore. (And symptom appeared month ago) concerned lot things coronavirus live pretty close City. feel like see universally everywhere indoors. live towards edge county? Tarrant, Denton, Collin counties pretty much zero enforcement. require wear masks distance. Go figure. Free Covid testing available many health departments, organized state local level, funded federal grants. federal government find mail tests too, isn’t quite bad sounds.

Don’t get wrong, national response total failure, people get free drive walk tests.  Well, defense, could also Spontaneous Pregnancy, Beard Sparrows, Moderate Severe Penis-Tacoing, Restless Leg Syndrome, Restless Arm Syndrome, Restless Torso Syndrome, Count Choculitis, Internal Antlering, Hairblood, Osteopierogies, Navel Decongestion, Rectal Secession, Foghorn Leghorns Facial Corkboarding. Fire dereliction duty find people job. answer. 

I believe said done virus we're going find way people ever knew, particularly early 2020. Now, I'm going claim levels unknown infections us anywhere near herd immunity, certainly not. 

But knowing now, COVID symptoms range severe nothing, even mild slight headache cough day - something happens us periodically never think anything - absolutely stands reason catch TON milder infections early months pandemic, honestly probably still missing lot too. Well, thank heavens whole COVID things hoax going disappear November 4th. Send $500 feed family. Dont selfish man. Jeez, that's awful. I'm sorry deal that. Yeah, right. would CCP allow release man made virus country? test effectiveness? 

As President-Elect Joe Biden says - C'mon (note statement near future). Look who’s risen grave. Bogged memory problems riddled bugs. Back recycling bin belong. Whew good thing turned corner. Gonna sooner dude. Yesterday’s “new single day infection rate” 70’000s. rate hit 6 digits November NZ small island nation surrounded hundreds miles ocean. close airports, ports simple isolate keep cases low.

If magic formula heavily based geography, share rest world. EU going record high new cases. 

Vietnam, SK, Taiwan praise be. Yeah businesses already enforcing mask policies states federally well. Starbucks harder maskless people country infected president lol. Meh. want go life way that’s fine. think it’s pretty selfish way go things. checked Sweden’s Worldometers charts. Looks like they’re huge surge new cases rest continent. Guess attempt herd immunity really fail.

It’s helpful tried though. took one team. know, strategy work. live Dallas see tons people wearing masks time. places enforce many not. 

Or people wear mask chin diaper hanging around neck.

Venture Collin county people wearing drops even more.

It's big reason cases rise penalty law enforcement? Either Biden takes charge gets blamed deaths winter, Trump stays power die ignorance. help though!

I’m Arizona. Prior governor allowing cities counties put mask mandates place, people place mask-free.

After mandate... majority people masked up.

Sure, might mask free birthday happening right now... least go Home Depot without running thirty morons without masks on. 

Look Arizona covid surge, quickly dropped started mandating masks cities counties. It’s night day. That's nice rally close field hospital. say Trump care Lifetime odds dying asteroid. odds getting Covid twice last six months. Differing time frame.

Covid around nine months so, hasn’t chance people get twice. number go up. 

If use stats baseline correctly aren’t. States Attorney Sheriff county said southern Illinois. state senate representative area even law suit governor emergency shutdown mandates. since revised position.

Are incapable revising advice presented new information different circumstance? Chill Fauci let idiots die  Frances daily new infections ~2.5x's US per capita basis. Belgium 5x's. Cases exploding Europe. well. Yes... European visitors important us.

...therefore decided permanently block instead agreeing stupid privacy laws. Good luck cancer deaths. “Good, I’ve wanting antibodies. Mind make out?” like advocating using condom babies still born world. I’ll agree that, agree need ration medical services (bars, restaurants, seeing friends, etc) back line care. aren’t willing part help bend curve shouldn’t get medical treatment isn’t enough go around. ~~Some~~ One also calls “winning”  There’s mountain data topic long term organ damage covid19. argument exactly oskarege posted, nobody measuring populace large. Immediate mortality stats aren’t going show us Sweden collectively lost hundreds thousands years life reduced lifespans covid damage. Maybe live.

Mask usage area country 25% max. vast majority people loudly proudly wearing masks - residents tourists alike. Shit happens. Depends definition normal. Compared average past ten years? Yes, it’s normal. Compared trend line past years? Yes, it’s normal. everyone else favor stop calling American. Gracias. Parenting choice. testing kid don’t want home day, literally stay home mom.... absurd. Even work home, work, it’s fucking pandemic. point, deadass feel like there's nothing do. Like virus ravaging country nonstop since like March... every level government blood hands. 

Is article concrete measures take halt virus 2020 ending anyone point to? little late indeed. China hotspot originated, nobody else completely closed besides maybe North Korea time. double standard left nauseating.   people value freedom don’t want trapped purgatory on-off lockdowns. way crush virus lockdown hard continue locking hard whenever new cases pop up.

The global economy cannot sustain entire planet this. also know population question government much control people’s lives (insert date keeps getting pushed back). spring advantage getting imported cases much later Italy/Spain, saw happening there, locked-down quickly.

Most EU countries exponential spread jump-started opening schools September 1st.

But Czechia contact tracing overwhelmed already 21st August, 400 cases per day capacity allowed uncontrolled tourism many risk locations without quarantines, brought cases contact tracing capacity.

So 10 days ahead exponential spread. You’re absolutely right. would like know people downvoting you. Death rate definitely increased area. area may different Username checks There’s statewide mandate state; still see people without them, nothing done. 

However, places it’s ENFORCED, it’s extremely effective. teach, we’ve school entire year, five days, changes except masks, cleaning, temp checks. 

We’ve one case year. That’s face man sick shit. Poor guy. Except access different treatment. Regeneron generally available. could easily see argument though HFR went non-overloaded hospitals meant people could go hospital sooner get better care. Overloaded hospitals means worst worst get cared for, HFR goes back up, sadly. England. scientists recommended short lockdown 2 weeks 3rd week September. PM ignored favour regional lockdowns scientists said enough. Unexpected stonks??? Nah probably use Yale test saliva based. It’s used Univ Illinois daily testing. He’s frail there’s way, got tested wore least mentally. recently compared two tests found saliva test comparable. Among 70 patients admitted Yale-New Hospital suspected cases COVID-19, saliva samples often contained copies SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, higher percentage saliva samples positive 10 days initial diagnosis. applied 495 health care workers, saliva tests identified two asymptomatic cases swabs did, leading team conclude letter, “our findings provide support potential saliva specimens diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 infection.” realize insane “20 % infected hospitalized” is? Last saw actually isn’t high factor missed mild asymptomatic cases, you’re taking initial high estimate saying “yea, that’s fine, COVID big deal.” Basically logic....I feeling wearing masks time may caught point. doubt of, I'm chancing find though since can't risk paid weeks right now....  sounds amazing 😂. Also, FAQ authors co-signers received money, honoraria, stipend, salary anyone either Declaration video recording.”

“The Declaration written signed American Institute Economic Research, located Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Institute kindly offered help video recording, providing location, equipment camera man pro bono.”

So nefarious AEIR involved insofar provided minor logistical assistance, provided actual funding authors, already determined content declaration would be. 

“AEIR kind enough provide venue meeting led Great Barrington Declaration, played role designing content.”

This criticism falls rather flat. doubt AEIR motives, saying it’s involvement calls doubt motives authors bit rich seeing involvement effectively event space. dropped break laws. [Title 75 Pa.C.S.A.

Come man use brain think through.. system bend us things get worse? happens unemployment gone jobs still fucked full unmasked coronas? fuck middle lower class amiright? would fun talking chinese bot maybe case thought ""protecting elderly"" south? 10 months later, still know. would never guessed US would worst world managing national emergency. awful group people. Telling nation six-foot-tall whiny babies put face diapers no-one smells poopy smells, paltry ten months rest world showing good solution? Best luck that. Well, three months vaccine. start slowly fade away. current level knowledge stick around forever, eradication thing. Yet. People testing often like probably rapid tests invasive (and also accurate) Restaurants deemed essential never shut down. Link government sources showing shut ever businesses talking please. I'm agreeing disagree facts happened. People let guys get away often. shut downs restaurants businesses, able provide sources. knew info then, actually death rate severity DECREASED since march, increased.  wonder we’re going shut again. important factor level so-called community transmission: many new COVID-19 cases immediate area. Caitlin Rivers, assistant professor Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, told wouldn’t comfortable indoor dinner party right now, matter what.

The problem kind data much lagging indicator.

By time one finds area turning hotspot, already late.  point, problem gaining momentum many days, weeks.

When live part world virus loose, assume worst. sheriff piece shit.  Yes it’s becoming seasonal

Canada spiking Quebec Yeah, well, that's just, like, opinion, man  I’m sick maybe shit. scientists need stop worrying political backlash unequivocally state need wearing masks. hillbilly president hillbillies support keeping trash fire burning. ""Surprised Pikachu face"" Wrong. economy poorly many businesses, including restaurants, forced shut down. simply agree disagree. go lick rumps captors.  think downvoters sense (morbid) humour. Reminds interview General Norman Schwarzkopf explaining reporters certain percentage Iraqi soldiers surrendered another certain percentage wounded another certain percentage captured.

What happened ten percent, reporter asked?

And could see wheels turning general trying think best explain demise. mind fuckin business Another post exact link removed hours ago ""Poor quality"" reason... Oh no, horrors living 'much less expensive area'! want give kids wrong impression families see hour day  Hmm, people discussing Indomethacin possible treatment symptoms? China control due hard borders totalitarian regime. Aus NZ control due completely sealed outside world. Neither sustainable strategies employed long term world (nor places). 

But case actually working, also fact countries less resources would likely fail controlling disease degree. already mentioned Argentina. *massive* numbers cases spite best efforts get control. countries would banned entering first world country indefinitely, throwing already struggling parts world abyss poverty desperation. 

Further, even case successful, global eradication measures, would continue live constant fear outbreak subsequent month-long lockdowns. would likely happen yearly basis, even countries adequate monitoring systems, due nature Covid transmission.

I agree many places incredibly unambitious response pandemic. Aggressive, general testing much wider contact tracing system implemented summer, lack thereof likely plain old negligence. borders open, getting seeded time. 

This probably forked Europe. High covid countries seeding low covid countries via tourism. Yeah, see two days ago thing math myself, that's two days still takes clicking back forth, copying numbers, etc.

It'd much better could see ""last 30 days"". already get free testing tons places though. Also homophobic. get wing hospital team works you, let us know. You’re 100 % right lmao threads filled lockdown “skeptics.” initially disregarded didn’t read comment assumed would inane rambling seeing downvotes. Vaccine F poor broken English sus Editing comment doesn’t change history....🙄kinda pathetic tried pass off. like start day tall glass bleach, UV rays asshole source SCB Cases increasing Sweden 3rd time Iran. told forum herd immunity much lower standard 50-70% infection rate 

Please apologize find weird much Pro-Sweden stuff is.

It's also weird much anti-US stuff is.

It's almost like countries intelligence operations running social media something Would like try EXTRA BIG-ASS TACO? MOLECULES! metric? Well either that, COVID sticks around least another year. ""Momertà"" types comments weren’t common theme among threads wouldn’t said anything. Borders closed yet, randomly tested PCR (15 minutes result) tests, yet confirmed... people angry like testing rats experiment borders opened. Use critical thinking. one gives shit “lied” greater good time. 

You easily rationale would concerned PPE shortages, look happened literally every store warehouse cleaned months. 

Do really think medical professionals front line? 

Once supply enough go around changed “now everyone wear mask”. 
The logic pretty easy follow. lot leader. Macron deliberately making little atttempt prevent virus spreading since first lockdown.

Even ignore strategy non containment indecisiveness killing people. locked length time February instead March would saved 10s thousands lives. would expensive.

He soon choice lockdown again. done already would saved 10s thousands lives again. wont late. cost even since curfew isnt free going kill many many people.

Thats French culture. Thats him. state needs fix it. misinformation - euromomo shows large number excess deaths 2020 Sweden. much recent years - - lot Norway. map look week 14 example, graphs look whole 2020 compared previous years, much worse. specify leading where. agree still important spotlight. nice offtopic go think personell opinions talk about. enjoy certain point maybe talk someone else. needed background enough fun dive deeper controversial topic. Russia vaccine. Vaccine might working worst numbers ever. Oh come on, we're nowhere near killing 35 million people!

/pedant Well kinda hit nail head. individualistic. People shitting mushroom clouds masks. imagine shitstorm caused asian measures? Like true enforced quarantines? Strict stay home orders? 24/7 surveillance? hell would break loose. impossible implement legally unrealistic expect people comply.

And TBH glad like that. like freedom like individualism. Sometimes backfires, true. time terrific. feel Sweden somehow excuse ignore virus. conveniently skim early second wave, high deathrate Great Nursing Home Massacre. Swedish cases rose around 40% latest week risen least 20% per week since beginning september. Better untouched pandemic fall winter. Actually strategy pursued New Zealand, China, etc. totally crushing virus possible anywhere. It’s matter political institutional will, world lacks (though it’d kind onerous US Europe let virus spread literally everywhere within countries). German Canadian scientists say? don’t understand need negative test go work? swab negative today get infected tomorrow, negative swab literally means nothing. I’m SHOCKED r/coronavirus would thing. go worldometers, set 2 days ago (because current day even yesterday updated super well), immediately see many cases confirmed day. little bit mental math, quickly see badly countries doing, example, Belguim Czech Republic 5x worse US, France 3x, Argentina 2x, etc. assumes comparable access testing. start banning internation sale arms Macron bad Trump? mathematician simply stating fact(assuming numbers correct). would facts annoy you? Amazon often Lysol wipes Pledge makes antibacterial cleaner Walmart carries. easier get paper towels!  aerosol spray hand isn’t happening.... Maybe jerks get Covid asymptomatic. Um no, I'm talking multitude videos leaked china mid January showing Chinese government taking extreme measures fight virus. videos people locked apartment buildings doors welded shut. Later videos people trying escape falling death, dead bodies pulled went back buildings. looked insane, again, chinese government done incredible job regulating internet, couldve manipulated Though likely virus evolved much less lethal overtime. seen videos, try find them. thing truly terrifying first started, matter feel now, see dealing thing point. type language heresy. coronacult displeased. Post cop Walmart, anyone tries walk without mask gets cited hundred $ first offense. Still lot labor, posting small numbers key locations mitigate. course depends area, gonna help place like NYC symptoms? That's true misleading. Covid data well reported many areas. California comes mind.

The point article there's enough data say schools covid super spreaders. Someone died car crash wearing seatbelt therefore one wear seatbelts. Hmm basis claim? keep reading sub. Like heck. often sent work. happening Europe right foreshadowing US experience? know Midwest increasing cases right now. Iiiits repost. first one article It’s scientists, it’s people charge bow Trump. point sane people already know benefits wearing mask, masks already mandated legitimate places businesses. needs change people getting together parties, baby showers, weddings, going beach etc isn’t pandemic going on. That’s trend infections anyway, events groups getting together wearing mask would helped little. say kids thought twice acting class knew yardstick coming out! 'epidemiologist' sister law said I’m shoved daughters nose - husband positive.... know many say this! Hello 12 month old MRI totally fine. Why? population Sweden, 2,000 deaths. Unfortunately reach Sweden numbers 6,000 deaths, doubt more. Karen kode Trump driving America around traffic circle turn signal 7 months. want off. say anything reinfections though. Got it, thanks! “If save ONE life worth it” - sub March Right? actually seems like no-brainer terms bringing back state revenue. Remeber Fauci said masks don’t work? exhausting... living here. Wear mask tho. Hospital bills negotiable. Many seem forget that. Summer 2021 earliest ask me. downplaying severity virus based sole opinion that's backed 0 data supports illogical opinion. That's harm. Social safety nets, look it. 🙄🙄🙄 god people like sad! protests fine let’s open outdoor events then. say outdoor events fine protests/riots safe, right??? claim go 30 percent.... claim 1 percent (which did) 


also gone since beginning pandemic....you think continue get bit better? I'm old enough remember January February 2020 media telling us nothing worry about, flu worse. Literally every healthcare professional asked looked like insane. March came along went ahead started wearing mask, actual n95s I'd stocked January. Fauci said ""you dont need masks, need masks"". didnt listen him, although look interview seem genuine response regarding contamination issues come along reused cloth masks. Again, people looked like insane wearing one. months went by, noone dieing middle street, groceries dry up, meat shortage much chagrin certain politicians. May, Northram mandated masks.  several months become apparent threat seemed be, maybe ""leaked"" information china manipulated, maybe virus evolved less deadly overtime. nonetheless noone locking people apartment buildings one falling deaths trying get water. I've made ab assessment risks personally decided serious. fuckers thought crazy January still think I'm crazy now. fucktards gave side eye wearing mask giving side eye wearing one. idiots ran around screaming ""the flu worse!"" idiots running around begging mask Mandates now. doesnt really matter me, why? I've three steps ahead whole time, continue so. I've come realize brainless zombies are, even aren't, rare actually courage step outside box. point dont even make eye contact, care, why? Again, zombies. mean counting comparing % differences. care closest without going 1% much closer reality .5% considering point. know do, get different spokes person came said lief protect supply masks. want believe Fauci point chump quotas though. Hey want say alone! two kids, one diagnosed developmental issue suspected. taking night classes pre-pandemic since pandemic, gave schooling make sure keep level remote learning. *It's much work.*

I'm fortunate work home, go much, I've taken driving around town get mind off. see interview? literally admitted lied (misled public) went explained ""this time okay because....""

He specifically said that. statement wrong.  knew masks useful prevent spread, even CDC's admission. Fauci admitted ""task force agreed didnt work"" technically correct.

Thats bullshit. much knew virus airborn passed. Even transmission methods, masks would effective. basic science health officials needed them.

Watch interview. read quote.  tell blatantly Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted yesterday “public health officials misled public effectiveness masks” ensure availability masks healthcare workers. Dr. Fauci said people health community concerned worried mask shortages health professionals  Yeah especially Reddit today, people seem acknowledge possibility something existing between.

The blogger chose highlight single month - trough two waves - falsely extrapolate claim entire year easily proved false. think issue called/compare waves, reality it’s like forest fire. surges occur “embers” never fully put out, restrictions end people start spreading further. Europe see wave, comes like flare caused everything opening up. us never really closed seriously, it’s like constant burn, another surge. Fauci go fuck founded predictions given happened worse second time around, claiming dissease worse winter less restrictions place magically drop IFR 30% CDCs current best estimates. right here. minute American Exceptionalism turned inability work together common goal (because that's sheep do) decline America started. would good could drop bombs virus solve problem working together society seems hard manage. tell people wear masks captain orange fucked even provide hospitals nursing homes adequate PPE, Fauci suggest would take supplies away front line workers. 

u/grabembythemaga beyond help. gargling orange nut sack deprived brain oxygen. Right. cops people urban areas state (OR) regularly don’t wear masks. that's rate tho cares point. We're fucked anyways Imagine thinking bit factual data fear-mongering. hope realize Europe fall single government, though bit less powerful American one proof that's case hyperbolic fear mongering? I've heard expect creativity people coped homes Hopefully humans pinnacle evolution cause are....fuck. Hopefully next species better. Embarrassment

Lack agency virus since us government downplayed much.

Laziness

Selfishness, one knows bf it, go life normal one call out. point Senate? People losing Americans taking things seriously. America could control. America could boasting travel bubbles right now. America could adequate social nets help people stay home lose jobs without losing homes savings. options there, options always there, options still right now, instead people getting sick dying. Hospitals flooding people losing homes jobs businesses. anti-US smugness sub summer unbearable. Europe experiencing thing we’ve got take high road avoid comparisons, right? vested interest, look information available, i.e. hospitals collapsing third time year.

A PFR 0.15% makes perfect sense given bad long.

And compare NYC 0.33% PFR Bergamo 0.6%, Peru 0.3% Take numbers Spring grain salt. extremely difficult get test back then. 

In NY, you’ve tested recently traveled China back early March. 

Then people sick enough hospitalized would get test. 

Officially NYC 260k cases antibody tests show 25% city exposed (which would mean 1.5 million cases NYC alone undetected) Yeah, cases never really started go national perspective Suppose look one-party communist state double poverty rate US answer problems. mean population curve right? that's apparently trying do. Flatline everyone Lived North Dakota 6 months year. I’m getting fuck today literally. 5 degrees morning it’s even Halloween. Poor southern misses warmth. catching give lifetime immunity. knew rounding curve you’re supposed slam goddamn gas 🤔 People don’t want hear unfortunately you’re right. I’m side need shut again. works government buys shutdown provides resources like you’ve mentioned people. current government interest plan. It’s people want learn live it, it’s **forced** live it. I’m hoping vaccine comes within next months minimize number deaths. be? told we're turning corner let audible giggle  assume wear masks? Get KF94 masks -- high filtration Korean masks, better 3-layer surgical, packs less $1.50 each. 98-99% filtration, compared cloth mask (~50% highly variable), standard 3-layer surgical mask nose wire (70-80%), N95 (99.9%). Victoria, Australia we're worried 7 new cases linked school. 83,000 unfathomable.  Clap up?! serotonin body platelets. Makes sense Prozac might help best waves, strong, well respected feel terrible making this: Really? Hospitals overflowing plenty places. areas shipping patients state.

Maybe hospitals overflowing area, mean happening though raw numbers may seem small compared cities, rural counties states like Kansas, Montana, South Dakota Nebraska highest rates infections per capita country. many places, hospitalizations also record levels. biggest challenge right finding beds need them,"" says Beverly Vilhauer, CEO South Central Health Wishek, N.D., 100 miles Bismark. ""What we're finding bigger hospitals, enough available staffed ICU WIS. — Wisconsin health officials announced Wednesday field hospital open next week state fairgrounds near Milwaukee surge COVID-19 cases threatens overwhelm ridiculous. *curving hand motions* Australia actually steepest declines infection rates, declined lot gradually. put place much less stringent methods so. example main amusement parks close, even day. yeah, masks normal thing made lighter touch workable, tracing program ground running right start.

But main initial outbreak came patient diagnosed potential corona case walking hospital test results came back. Believe Doctor here, taking medicine already? virus also spread many communities point. point literally everywhere going catastrophic. I've spoken many people *none* outside healthcare field seem understand fucking dangerous healthcare system getting overwhelmed be.

We're talking people, America, 2020, dying infections broken bones teens 20s. Pneumonia flu basically going become secondary tertiary pandemics among elderly immunocompromised hospital access.

I really wish people understood bad really, really get. already deleted it, hit reply accident, bad supposed go Italy honeymoon bunch Italy Facebook groups/subreddits saw everything go down. could sleep night family making fun me. called travel agent full concern said media exaggerates kind things.

In April two grandparents died Dad ventilator (he survived). Yeah theres anything authoritative governments good basically imprison population instantly case pandemic. think I’ll still go democracy everything else, take risks times like these, though Current death rates correspond current infection rates. probably start going weeks along current increase cases. plenty coronavirus long haulers symptoms months after. deep trouble. rounding corner alright. Rounding corner another wave. difficult find many tests US day? eg. many tests guys conduct TPR 83k?  Prozac waste water due people taking it. Yup, hear lot rural AZ. plot mysteriously disappear Nov 4. shows egocentric Americans global tragedy unrelated national big dick contest. Actually, lot countries experiencing second wave, USA might come first country longer worry corona.

Why ask?

Well long keep compounding waves, stack em, eventually everyone infected, 3 million dead, don’t worry anymore!!! /s legit thpough biden going Faint one point near end head started nod slowly eyes closed. Hed dood look tired end clock watching debate. bad move ? No, American people killing collective IQ 50 comes corona prevention (and many things). Looking trend we’ve seen far, it’ll encourage public mask burnings. Ehhhh right sub. compare COVID statistics covidamerican currency give idea, sort like US dollar. 

In covidamericans, think France still front? God hope don’t shut talking rate increase, decreasing? mocking reporter wearing mask today. IIRC, there's degree doubt/concern (and possibly study, find damn link looked at), without vaccine, herd immunity may feasible.

Edit: found it: fearless leader told turning corner it’s fine. 

Everything fine. Planet Fox News. It’s actually 230,000 American deaths americans fucking legends. dont give fuck virus. guys fucking wild. balls would Imagine people thinking China India double unreported lol biggest best covid ever. worry whack POTUS said vaccine weeks away y'all fine genuinely wish country best. every intention helping tourism economy visiting Argentina national parks things clear. beautiful country always wanted see it’s tragic see happen fearless leader told turning corner it’s fine. Everything fine. Omg  assume muh freedom helping. burnout already happening still get winter. Holy hand sanitiser batman. real? fuck happening there. cannot adequately explain much pressure one state governments Australia poor decisions allowed COVID-19 escape hotel quarantine.

905 Australia died. That's tally, states, entire year 2020. Multiply number 13.3 make us population US (physical country roughly size) adjusted deaths ~12k. 1:19 death ratio possible. Hand full cases day, normally single digit thereabouts. context moment time ~200 Australians active cases last couple weeks. testing numbers significant. fuck.

How even fix problem US? Can't simple asking people wear masks. live 2nd biggest city state. cases. active cases. one well month. Every single person wearing mask without exception even virus town. know think :( want see guys turn around :( I’m still convinced that’s started wave 2 Toronto.
33 cases one day. Everyone pumped hour news broke Brass Rail. Steadily ever since numbers crept amazes we're even November yet virus ramping hardcore Europe. going dark winter coming months unfortunately projections lot people going pass time. Another lockdown going massive killer economy inevitably that. 

It seems like we're close finish line too, vaccines may nearly ready. Yet know ready time lot people going die.

It's draining. hate feeling utter helplessness. going freeze rent mortgages? should.

Are going hand $2000 month? should.

As schooling perfect solution, solution involves spreading illness death unacceptable. Virtual schooling best got, although acknowledge far perfect. Rounding corner main runway really taking off! 4-6 weeks we’ll seeing largest one-day deaths, time Thanksgiving OK cases one thing deaths? goi g down. need heard immunity? Good point. early action matters huge amount too. see lot European countries American brand idiocy get act gear months Korea. 12k died Obama vastly less dangerous virus. shudder think many would died Obama Biden faced virus. Probably would never shut travel china due “racist” lmao testing more.... /s  Editing reply error I'm going flip coin say good lab technician.

In simple terms, I'm going give 9 glasses water 1 glass piss. combine tell drink it, taste? give 10,000,000 concoctions this, many times think pure water? Agree. think “lockdown effects” articles supposed make us feel bad lockdowns, reality it’s “terrible pandemic also causes collateral damage”. Stick guns, wait. mean super spreader events? thought riots protest marches trump? work movie theater industry. gauge lot things releases. Last year feels like lifetime ago. Avengers: Endgame last April. Joker came last October massive hit. last Star Wars came less year ago! really feel like another time. Hey! You’re needs mask you’re graduating! Get flu shot too. Avoiding coinfection absolutely necessary survival  miss future. human nature. can't keep going like this. wait numbers week two Halloween. didn’t win popular vote we’re “rounding corner”. Wishing gf well man. panic. power this. Stay positive alert. Cheers Ride Never Ends actual leaders. like downward spiral.  India's numbers arent reliable, lacking necessary infrastructure able test population areas. testing per capita also 1/5 US moment. hard compare data. turn graph upside down, shows curve actually going   Haha, suck France! USA! USA! toxic level stress good physical health. used work children autism yes cried stress trying reason pseudoscience experts. alienating forced accept part reality, even facilitate communication. attitude! Insane isn’t it? testing suppression, positive case / tests still super high. valuable datapoint data suppression. rounding corner case rate going verical Sky News? next? Breitbart? Daily Stormer?  death numbers second surge half first surge despite almost twice many cases second surge. People readily ignoring fucking cunt  Way look this, lot countries. country approved treatment experimental treatment? so, I'll take account credibility country.  
Otherwise ... I'm tired. Turning corner alright. Turning wrong way though. Hopefully winter slow Norway people less likely go party cold.  choice hermit levels depression or

Wait, people got hermit-levels depression March/April? Uh oh, gonna like one times mix night days way reset power full day. Except instead passing out, breathing. 

Guess I'll see everyone May.   people even remember swappening, much less sub. sub dumpster fire sub longest time lmao. I’ve following closely daily updates since Jan 23 Yes did. answer no. Average age COVID death literally 80 years old. COVID kill them, something else would real number could easily double. course! someone already sick susceptible thing killed wasn’t thing killed them! cancer patient gets hit car car didn’t kill FOOLS, ‘twas cancer.

Edit: someone preexisting conditions weakened immune system, got coronavirus died; saying coronavirus didn’t kill absolutely fucking laughable. whole point republicans argue don’t worry we’re old risk, old risk don’t die covid either? Yet guy balls say feels bad world views. Fucking ridiculous. Doubt longer fellow Canadian people attitude shipped states ride out. Maybe dumbass change tune. oof Ugh epic!!!! Got him! thank Trump leading American public wear masks &amp; continuing crowded mask-less rallies. leader! lead example! many following lead. sad! parents, pro-mask healthworkers, Fargo debated whether attend mask-optional “we don’t like masks” wedding. ultimately went. wear masks church everyday . r moving end year humunga dunga! 75 911’s far. Let marinate Biden out-trolled orange mc-large huge troll here? rude funny.. saved 2 million people win 4 years USA believes him! guys make sick. locked like 76 days? Don’t worry... fine people US rounding bend / corner.

What’s another couple hundred thousand deaths? keep following orange tangerine. found. ???? 
Oh. Must great even need view it. humunga dunga! infinite corners!  ""We're rounding corner, go away second now""

If one thing certain, Trump eventually right. even remotely constitutional going new let's see Jacob Wohl thinks this. apparently saying ""I really like boss hope okay"" led bot remove comment incivility!

But anyway, people work risky, boss covid, hope okay. Same!! remember reading article like 'ehh, boring. else news?"" lol :) little late. F trump. Crash burn traitor. live IL nurses go strike summer. least one hospital Chicago south east suburbs hit really hard local prison. hope. 100k next week lock, sad state affairs luckily rounding corner really surprise me, saw popular French Youtuber taking COVID pretty seriously basically give entirely. he's traveling maskless countries walking around everywhere hugging kissing people going back France.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Current deaths covid US 2230000, little bit behind. cfr gone since, up. Jesus I’m heading bar. You’re delusional Bezos laughing while. wear masks, think protests going on, numbers gone down. Trump sprayin shit people arent wearing masks suddenly rises?

Or Excusatrump? roommate tested positive right recovering/reaching end quarantine, received positive test two weeks prior.

I planned return work Monday positive test I'm wondering should? Even though I've recovered living infected household, continue quarantine/work home? Like Breaking News meaning.  Like... himself? weird thing rapidly things changed. felt like one week, 90% life still normal, within rapid succession days suddenly lockdown city looked [like days that, started hearing sirens everywhere New York. Non-stop. even knew it, 25,000 new yorkers died span 30 days. 

It especially weird 2 months leading that, telling everybody virus telling huge deal. listen all, hit us, hit us like brick. 叫不醒装睡的人 Plus much less worry vaccines expected suddenly get hijacked somehow last minute. See: happened PPE. even know talking about? industry leading vaccine companies like Moderna, Pfizer, Oxford, J&amp;J ramping manufacturing months phase 3 trials even started.

The coronavirus also pretty stable mutate readily influenza.  I'm convinced Covid deniers aka Republicans need someone close die horrible death wake up. is. “It’ll disappear” told us. tax returns Can’t wait nov 4th magically disappear /s Wavy baby! Wait, pandemic over? people done dying now? gotten past it? Jot record books?

Trump made fun someone wearing mask. routinely that. objectively false handled perfectly.

You're hopeless. study done hospitalized patients.

The vast majority people get virus recover fully week two. “Long covid” much rare sub wants believe. Basically Joe Rogan joked might super-spreader, Maynard went along joke (I’ve never really listen Joe rogan before, I’m Tool fan curious know would talk experience Covid. joe started going CBD got bored tuned out) article kind tries spin like may irresponsible, sick FEBRUARY. saw doctor followed orders, can’t fault knowing information wasn’t available back then. 8? Months in,no done since day 1. many deaths illnesses,and seems alot taking seriously, shame. Hahahah. Yes No, someone stroke Lol Canada also opened schools. least he'll flatten curve fIbOnAcCi sEqUeNcE Pff... gonna happen. Yeah, big event rally caused El Paso. lot little ones. Every day last six months huh? Texas, police department going enforce mask policy. Also me, grateful notice early take seriously. immunosuppressed person stocked people freaked slammed stores. able avoid shopping safety measures firmly place. credit subreddits that. 99.99999999999% Chinese believe Dr. Zhongnanshan

This statement ridiculous don’t even need address it. death threats 

There 340 million people United States. insulted president US public.

Yes, president US gigantic moron. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Except even worse dead people take beds hospitals, sick people do. many others waiting refunds since march flights cancelled due covid. Also route originated US, purchased directly Avianca, credit card.  Barclays honor chargeback Avianca says refund ""authorized"" refuses pay out. filed complaint DOT sided also indicated legal authority anything. Avianca gave CEO 5 million dollar bonus since pandemic began. Sociopaths. Seconded. tool fans must annoying pretentious music fans time. pay attention. thread sub explaining positive found, China would retest least 2 times verify. looked local health departments? Suck buttercup. Think kinds things ancestors deal with. think people 1944 saying “you know what, I’m sick war, let’s let Hitler destroy everything kill many people wants”? 

Have fucking grit. grand scheme things year two life. aren’t tough enough ride aren’t worthy. scared (County) got classified ""87 - High risk"" 50/100K per week counts high risk). checked US saw guys running close 1000... Yikes official estimates flu deaths US take account rate flu testing dead/dying patients. Flu death estimates include lab confirmed flu cases

Dead/dying people get tested influenza USA?

The flue death estimates estimating ""people die flu"". trying estimate ""people die flu"".

The Covid numbers show people die Covid, it. spend next ten countries combined mostly needles war machine. also hand tax cuts reason. already spend per capita healthcare countries single payer. Definitely people vote purses. Imagine things would improve they'd pay fucking taxes. Lockdowns panacea. Lockdowns emergency brake TTI fails.

JP locked schools areas shut lot businesses recommendations social pressure. 
I still sure JP success low testing numbers guess miss lot cases possibly deaths.

I agree best path would copy RoK strategy. brought church outbreak rigid TTI impressive. Problem Europeans underestimated virus overestimated means contain it. neither tech copy Korean TTI system, basically people obsessed mirage data privacy.

I also think shouldnt discount Chinese example. locked incredibly hard deep. still remember everyone misunderstood overreaction. Time seems proven us wrong. Ok whatever. fun dying California? Masks spring explosion cases summer. Mass, fine $300, various PDs openly stated pursuing fines, focusing educating people instead. instances *the cops still get speed themselves.*

You see problem? wearing masks promise you. still thinks it’s big deal mostly hoax. favorite thing say people pussies days lol. Outdoor lower risk, sure. look party pubs threw Supreme Court justice nominee got several sick really shitstorm a'brewin. Starting mid-October here, huge crowd-drawing event holiday festival every two weeks. Starting fall festival Oct 12th ending New Years. let anything like pesky ol global pandemic get way. 

And come hell high water, powers going god damn thing say ""I trust right thing.""

Man, screwed. Yeah colder gets would say higher number gets Happens way often. I've heard positive individuals expected quarantine 10 days, contact 14 days still recommended. Jesus. I'm Realtor... showed client house yesterday, liked carpets, would avoid irritating asthma conditions.

Naturally, wearing mask. Sigh... doom doom doom would like add us acting insane regards pandemic situation.  Meanwhile, company good keeping remote, suddenly forcing everyone back office. spent 8 hours day close quarters 7 people, without masks. 

WTF wrong everybody? [COVID-19 causes wide range physical neurological long-term Tell skeptics think ""oh, I'll get virus immunity, can't bad."" That's one many reasons ""herd immunity"" approach recommended. good point! stay safe Johnson Johnson said stroke. questionable. vaccine triggering MS

They independent review said inconclusive. think know better you, quite unscientific suggest know fact specialists involved don’t. 

Having said dislike J&amp;J knew talc asbestos it. much usually? lay shrooms America change ways, yeah, y'all gonna die upvote courage admit wrong internet YES, 99.99999999999% Chinese believe Dr. Zhongnanshan, Dr. Fauci family face multiple death threats insulted president US public. think lot places like that. US. Thank context tho, appreciate it. Absolutely. We'll hit 500,000 excess deaths January. holidays going kill lot people. mean lot republican states rolled back mandates pretended everything’s fine infection counts keep going up. ? *always* indoor spread. 

idiot confirmed. Let's clear something, actions called ""mandates"" reality ""guidelines."" *noun*: **mandate**; plural noun: **mandates**  official order commission *noun*: **guideline**; plural noun: **guidelines**  general rule, principle, piece advice.

In fact, I'm pretty sure everything public sphere presented ""guideline"" basically unenforceable. 


Private entities enforce rules, airlines deny boarding someone without mask. Government(s) US mandate anything politics. Almost like Q104.3 used play Billy Joel Garden commercials constantly. like sheep. They'll everyone else doing. takes one small group complain people quickly jump board.

The lack self-awareness incredible gOiNg DiE MS causes transverse Myelitus (spinal inflammation) along lesions optic nerve brain. number neurological diseases cause TM, including even discovered yet makes TM devastating. MS can't diagnosed antibody test, instead requires reviewing MRI specific oligoclonal band type protein shows up. vaccine triggering MS, ticking time bomb certain people, basically person going get MS, perhaps could lived life many years MS symptoms occurred, vaccine. look article third case. give society enough food enough entertainment eventually people become collectively idiots. 

The rise anti intellectual thought country despicable. Holcomb doesn’t care. He’s concerned re-election. outdoor parties low risk *if* people wear masks go indoors. premade online programs could purchased. Lol. ""Outside senior's facilities""? That's Trump-level cherry picking going on! 

That's cherry picking. like states, canada policy keep infected seniors LTC homes. result huge outbreaks homes *could avoided* different policies.

The difference USA LTC deaths make half total, say situation ""half total situation"".

In Canada, LTC situation *was almost entire situation*. Different policies LTC would monumental effect total deaths.

But change anything? Nope. comes winter, idiot somewhere said ""Hey lets set 'hot zones' infected Covid patients LTC health agencies Quebec asking public long-term care homes establish ""hot zones"" accommodate COVID-19 patients live staff family members, scarred treatment residents first wave, worry move could lead cross-contamination outbreaks inside home.

Can possibly predict happen? Gosh. imagine? .. suggestion ...

CAN STOP PUTTING INFECTED PEOPLE NEXT SENIOR look good compared countries seriously screwed up. look mlm pretty bad compared countries didn't. Germany example, significantly double population yet nearly 1,000 fewer deaths.

This comparison stuff funny. Germany looks bad compared Poland. Finland looks bad compared India. etc etc etc. You’re developing country don’t see it, problem: educated people work computer. That’s like dozen helpers. productivity way up. salary way up, work remotely pandemic doesn’t affect you. buy $million houses drive Tesla.

On side, uneducated artistic, anyone works hands living without help computer, can’t make enough survive. US minimum wage still $7.25 many computer jobs pay $72.50. people working without computer cling anyone power side.

The Democrats work support poor unfortunately value intellectual. use science computer solve problems, slowly uneducated people distancing away Democrats don’t understand Democrats saying computer science taking away jobs. Stuff Trump says, understand. Even though Trump billionaire, he’s unsophisticated, unpolished, identify him. understand him. sympathize struggles. make fun him, love that’s feel everyday, look them, make fun them.

This country huge problem now. rich poor. middle shrinking fast, pandemic accelerated rate. Agreed. I'm moving another country passport worth piss. Uhhhhh....source? 100 dollars says piece shit Montana trouble North &amp; South Dakota simply fucked!

Good job everyone freedoms, wear fucking mask go out. I’m talking Wuhan. military deployed prevent folks fleeing. extreme, likely huge amount prevent going beyond recovery elsewhere China. 

The collective mindset right thing everybody China managed recover. know almost become meme ""waiting weeks numbers spike"" numbers literally high come spike deaths Europe within next 4 weeks. far lot reason believe exponential growth wont continue, least weeks. weeks/months half assing wearing masks, people done it.

there reason think going slow anytime soon hope lifetime ban. one-day peak. back 138, consistent average last month so. start refusing care

Exactly this. Whether insured not, people America used showing hospitals getting form care, however mild may be. 

What they're used refused medically. I'm place even refused I'm sure would change minds. $100 dollars Biden people blame trump Probably millions. Countries like uk, Italy Spain estimated well 100K/day respective peaks know crazy right?? March me. get year. It’s fault many leaders screwed pooch one Old news point Exactly. *willful* ignorance. point, make fucking *effort* insist ""believe"" masks work. hellbent destruction, go it. Jump goddam bridge already. terrible shame innocent people get dragged along. also unconstitutional shut Inter intra state traffic hurricanes natural disaster seen naked eye? little bit reading scientists virologists actually saying, you’d know lockdowns damage good. controlled citizens listened government frankly lot Americans others don’t want government control lives way order stop pandemic Hospital worker US. Talked family member phone whose mother dying covid went rant masks hyped be, etc etc. fight? It’s factually wrong Meanwhile, dumbass red neck trumper neighbor big outdoor party today. Wtf wrong fucking twats. agree entirely you, similarly mind. mind though utter hypocrisy [relentlessly attacking Obama going on[ golf far often far expense taxpayer chooses it. Well, that’s ‘Europe’ Pretty sure 3rd wave (ska) already. Maybe even quadruple wave Wouldn’t winter decrease cases cause would inside due cold thus less likely spread? idiot? Yeah, cause state leadership would rather boast masks useless actually try protect citizen's. doubt we'll reelect asshats put us mess well... right US seeing 80k cases one day. country full selfish pricks ""literally care"" 200,000 people died it. never recover year. Current IFR includes beginning pandemic... hospitals overrun yes mortality goes parts county. Hospitals overrun parts country summer. wild assume medical practices continue improve better treatments become available....it's already happened. US big enough waves national scale make sense talk like that.

The individual states/regions waves different times. Federal Government Even Biden admitted constitutional authority elected. said would make ""recommendations"" states. Thanks. know I'm alone social isolation really help little voice says am, appreciate words. 

Having two probably unique set challenges so, salute you. Homeschooling definitely better e-learning despite education, I'm certainly getting one literacy development support rn. Grateful support private OT SLP.

We get back eventually man feel old. 20 somethings I'm competing grad school got leg quicker minds. we'll get there. suppose tests made? shipped? cost supplies? Law enforcement needs reminded law enforcement. paid enforce laws pick choose laws want enforce. need better leadership culture. require arriving people Covid test aged 7 days, less 3 arrive Bermuda. tested arrival free go receive PCR test results, turn around 5 hours. then, self isolate. get tested day 4,8,15. far, basically kept us Covid free except picked arrival left us active case load hovers around 4-6 people. Everyone lives feels like threat, still wear masks public spaces because, well, not?

In Atlantic Canada, formed “Atlantic Bubble” come outside four-province bubble, quarantine 14 days. kept relatively Covid free too. 

What Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, New Zealand common first sign trouble locked locked hard. Bermuda, entire population quarantined three weeks, allowed nearest grocery store pharmacy day week assigned surname. None “but office needs me!” exemption crap; everyone except enforcing health measures working pharmacies grocery stores locked down. movement people controlled military roadblocks prevented people going farther nearest stores. killed cases time cautiously regained freedom restrictions.

Science win. hell could 'avoid politics' post topic political figure. months? You’re optimistic friend much bigger US population today comparison 1918? God damn must hard living life IQ lower 70. mask dude. giving freedoms. It's. A. Fucking. Mask. I’m arguing better methodology explain anything. presented info compiled. I’m saying wrong, I’m trying inform presented  everyone gonna get infected sooner later, really matter? types discussions take place every day people leave thinking said anything worthwhile affirming beliefs they're right cause joe schmo finish high school classes agreed something even full grasp of.

You ever notice they'll question sources go beliefs NEVER anything supports it. Even opinion piece tabloid, anything want fact, anything want false news. 

Logical fallacies way down, can't think reasonably never arrive right hypothesis. hand, places like Arizona (?) see drop positive cases mask mandate given. marijuana masks. Thank god cops basically everyone else wears one am, except homeless people around (they’ve given masks, won’t wear them) choice either online inperson, opted online, school staff principal tries make parents children feel like assholes picking online option. cases child's school every school active cases. fucked! special kind. Jesus comes them.. church Bethel, Redding megachurch ***whose members believe raise dead heal sick.*** 300 students staff church’s School Supernatural Ministry tested positive disease.

even garden variety evangelicals County Supervisor **Les Baugh Christian pastor loudest voice among colleagues pushing back California’s COVID-19 restrictions local businesses.**  remarkable Thursday **to see criticize one largest evangelical churches Northern California failing take seriously role outbreak** grew large Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration ordered restaurants “non-essential” businesses Shasta County stop serving customers indoors. mom needs psychiatric attentions often supposed asymptomatic super spreaders coughing thus dispersing droplets? They're not. aerosol transmission supposed super spreaders. Therefore cloth masks insufficient. spent summer working classroom ventilation best practices, also making plans would work, ie. form child care. denying covid actually airborne like happening 8 months, even though knew was.

Basically needed treated with, say, half fervor war drugs. Except every turn attempt actually deal covid thwarted people want play normal.

People's lives impacted, people face financial hardship, things going get worse get better. People need realize way situation without pain going forward.

And people refuse accept said pain, painful going be. we're stuck mad ride. way forward without personal sacrifice, much population never sacrificed losing minds bargaining virus. Nah... like freedoms you’re welcome wear like. won’t give ounce freedom causs government says wear mask lol. snow got going packing indoors even now. next couple months going great. yeah, fuck that. scientists studies trying Trump Bolsonaro. LoL Well seems protection Good job announcing planning this, go court scary? piece cloth dude. Get yourself. thing live. Mandate went effect, little actual change. Still see plenty people without masks. part seems like outnumber people masks on. 85k cases??? study lancet found NYCs infection fatality rate 1.4%.  still way blogger. states methodology detail. one using “wrong” data current year population (wrong blogger). He’s fudging numbers, using him. 

With said I’m clocking now. taken way much time today Quite hypocritical you. Calling pathetic trying act high mighty. Get Commandmanda me. Sorry. I'm still trying figure magic going school. One year creative things possibly reading feel like rather might bad thing all.

Not every parent cut teaching home motivated kids seem able learn rules kinds games, therefore read strategize. one year simply going make big difference kids learning. Herd-immunity become viable goal though simply alternative unpleasant. 

Sure, good idea attempt immunity vaccination, also plan alternative scenario constant eradication measures keep virus death toll bay. Like Chinese since day 1, weird reason Europe US haven't. could possibly gain forcing people wear fucking mask, dude? Use brain once, please. Hawaii here. Mask mandate enforced warnings citations LEOs, mostly citing residents. State went ahead reopened travel tourists, Mayor Oahu went handed masks tourists beach. Optics locally Caldwell cares visitors locals, cops continue writing citations. probably said thing test ""come man"" Nah warning signs surge present Sturgis. Sturgis didn’t help things, think little simplistic call catalyst considering normal day-to-day behaviors people here. I’m way blogger it’s dishonest, done intentionally (which might be). 

The reason big increase (around 500 k, 5%) Sweden’s population since 2015 predominantly refugee crises 2015, lot young (read: &lt;65 yo) came Sweden. increase newborns top that. 

These affect death rates much. So, want make fair comparison 2020 last five years see impact COVID Sweden, look raw numbers excess deaths. per capita. 

If compare COVID19 Spanish flu, per capita numbers would better metric. specific called Democrat’s criticisms response “new hoax”. countless examples downplaying virus. really thinks it’s him. mir@cle. forget older generations went entire lifetime without seeing anything close like this. could see someone much older us doesn’t follow news mindstate “don’t worry like everything else pass”. It’s time wrong lifetime (well hopefully lifetime) event happened Please stop watching Fox News, rotting brain. Maybe? Sound argument. surrender 🏳 worship false god. late. idiots set stone validated highest levels.

Things like set early on. Eh, information there. Literally fingertips available seconds. It’s selfish people willingly choose ignore logic, fact science causing problems dangerous think otherwise.  It’s like would listen anyway wouldn’t magically assholes anymore. He’s simply telling want hear vote him. difference .65 going .5 30%.

We also flattened curve summer. cases surging fall winter hospitals starting overwhelmed. telling summers IFR .64 going go lower middle surging cases lessened ability treat severe cases? know one signs intelligent person ability change mind light better evidence? See didn’t get response. It’s people don’t like think there’s definition limitations freedom US. absolutely is. High five 🙌 survive take care yourself. Maybe find meaning helping others too. Chinese (outside Hubei) style lockdown replicated anywhere except China countries fully eradicated virus new domestic cases appear.

It mostly *preemptive* lockdown: lockdown detected case count 10 per million, one could know many undected cases were. Also, closing borders provinces, cities even villages (except essential personnel, truck drivers, must follow strict protocols) stops spread.

It called ""overreaction"" western countries time. However, contact tracing enforced quarantine, domestic transmission completely eradicated, lockdowns lifted one month two. Contact tracing negative tests from. damn Sweden better eurpoean countries Sweden lockdowns? Trump wont even say last time tested negative, got tested first debate. Thanks kind words. afraid next weeks situation even worse. Lockdowns? parts country locked down, everyone followed rules anyways. anti mask riots idiots openly defying public health initiatives. actually effective lockdown, we’d able achieve South Korea New Zealand done. Better call cops then, I’m downplaying virus!! sound like karen. basically don’t care little Typhoid Mary kills teacher, kids get infected bring home kill parents. Got it. Exactly Jesus would do. say find plot last episodes really unbelievable though. They're saying Europe, trouble keeping shit together first wave, gonna ignore problem waste course one 40-minute episode. meantime thing going happen US, literally one week election. timing realistic.

And that's going episode 11. bet season finale going crazy plot twist set next season. there's vaccine. least reduced massively longer pandemic. Bucyrus here. People wear entry token stores. nose around chin. Usually one store one Yeah, probably. going long winter, survive. Abortion different issue zygote alive. 

Regarding requirements diseases pretty common healthcare require vaccined influenza wear mask flu season, risk others.

Ultimately comes compassion solidarity. care others inconvenience protect them. Im sure life china awesome aren’t Tibetan, Uyghur, value privacy. Minot also one. gives hope species - it’s probably me. COVID confirmed decision kids pets require attention this. Focus basic needs now. Plenty sleep. Eat healthy. Go walk. Focus less news. Live rock think health depends this. world vaccine already rolled out? Russia Sputnik V? police force useless comes enforcing types rules. revenue generator, they're voting Trump common sense anyway. Dude, I'm OP seriously think may need immediate psychiatric attention. Sparrows

I bet board member unironically believes birds real either. Cause they’re already “normal”. You’re one mask issue. 

I can’t get it’s political. people shout lives matter subvert minority support, watch encourage 200,000 Americans killed Check HOCL. make lysol nowhere found. Word. Along lines, pay farmers billions dollars PLANT crops, helps keep price crops higher. Except Trump literally care all, got it. Called hoax couple months then, day, blames China things US. hypocrisy Trump never changed stance like Fauci did. I'm guessing think hoax care countries. I've seen around here, we're absolutely fucked significant differences observed bivariate analysis case-patients control-participants shopping; gatherings ≤10 persons home; going office setting; going salon; gatherings persons home; going gym; using public transportation; going bar/coffee shop; attending church/religious gathering.

Did bury lead here? Holy shit. Keeping kids school 100 % damaging it’s horrendous cruel reopening plans haven’t made schools primary priority can’t really fault people wanting kids get sick.  close restaurants 18.00? don’t even open 19.00... wonder risk students move quarantine year, bounced hybrid remote consistency. wonder risk classmate teacher gets sick worry blame. wonder risk bring virus home grandma grandpa Thanksgiving. Yeah nice still can’t read. Seriously one understands state local government works we're fucking commenting like political science degrees Princeton. Hope dad right Even might help, you’re going run hurdles trying implement actual mandate/requirement unless attached penalty tax even you’d need Congressional action. 

There’s little chance executive order (the easiest way try) would stand constitutional muster. It’d creating something wholecloth there’s precedent it.

If Congress passed something Executive signed, it’d probably okay (using ACA ruling precedent) you’d get sides congress approve there’s little chance that.

So pretty much dead idea. 

Sadly, need see deaths spike well. averaging 500 per day (spot checking Google chart). Karen’s ones noses sticking masks spreading ‘rona. would apt put USA since subreddit US centric North dakota almost one percent population active covid cases. Almost consider ND loss battle. double standard trusting Fauci verifiably lied unreal well. family Utah confirm happening. kids also making pacts sports programs get shut down. far dad seen, cases life long complications extremely rare India far.

(He’s one treating COVID-19 patients) Perhaps, covid also leaves complications patients post-infection, feel likely see causing deaths line even we're pandemic.

Not mention kids become points transmission people. worth whichever way slice it, opinion. heard someone say allow even you’re covering maybe they’re wrong sound like someone capable even getting woman bed. vasectomy great backup though. power play

Dude, like three people asked government possibly gain answered them. would need mandate mask virus survival rate 98-99%

Because still 1-2% people dying?! care 200,000 America alone died this? knew Republicans stupid know heartless Reddit: Let's lockdown. certainly seems like we’re following Europe’s trajectory. cases rising across US, Midwest. I’m Midwest state, hasn’t seen significant surge since spring, beginning see uncontrolled spread. Lol, “three steps ahead”? You’re idiot thinks you’re smarter everyone else you’re actually not. There’s reason wear mask willful neglegence.

Do know says *one* guy store proudly wearing mask? There’s reason people don’t make eye contact. It’s likelihood you’re kind sociopath don’t want risk getting stabbed.

Here’s newsflash: reason haven’t caught attitude like *everyone else* wearing masks protect *you.* You’re nothing human garbage. refuse take refugees want keep national sovereignty large degree Thanks! No, pointing exponential virus like takes 4-6 weeks sort spike separate noise. ""wait 2 weeks"" really ""wait 4-6 weeks"" guarantee spike. Florida already massive spike likely climb back time. expect FL southern states actually get fair bit better winter, pandemic still going come late spring/summer next year likely end another wave point. Viruses ""alive"" sense define life ""know"" anything, bit genetic code. Either code viable not.

Strains virus infectious less fatal simply better chance spread become common. “Perhaps important factor level so-called community transmission: many new COVID-19 cases immediate area. Caitlin Rivers, assistant professor Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, told wouldn’t comfortable indoor dinner party right now, matter what. going risk it, it’s safer areas seeing five 10 new cases day per 100,000 people, test-positivity rate less 5 percent. Tom Tsai, health-policy professor Harvard, puts number slightly higher, 25 cases per 100,000.”


Austin hitting 8.8 new cases per 100,000 people positivity rate 3.3. I’m running bar feel like risk low enough hang another family also working school home. hope information helps people evaluate risk indoor socializing community. Lol. argument based wishful thinking mine supported cdc saying want admit argument ""dommsday"". trolling rn? Ok many life long handicap? else Trump lying about?

Yet people want follow blindly says beating COVID, don’t need masks, shouldn’t worry it.

The double standard unreal. ok. Haha fixed! Thanks! 80% infected hospitalized, tend older. denialism recognize outcomes among hospitalized covid patients representative general population expect they're infected.

Source: kind at-home testing still hassle mail swabs processing. dropping vial might well head Urgent Care clinic rapid test. think would make sense processing huge cohort, like corporate department sports team. situation would hassle &amp; every individual go clinic own. don’t give fuck says, it’s unconstitutional vaccines, rapid testing, treatments, etc. hopefully ramping early 2021. 

the issue view really driving spikes right much Northern U.S. weather sweet spot cold wintry enough seasonal affect wreaking havoc driving people indoors, cold *enough* yet people going less. 

shit obviously awful right hard look country say anything close decent plan, and/or things get better next two three months couple reasons why. There’s plan. States going themselves. We’re going continue get decimated vaccine.  Oh agreed, anything substantial coming dems? Let’s assume best case scenario Joe wins, happens then? know post sounds like vent I’m actually really curious plan getting somewhere here. important news come put USA everyone ignoring it. Basically, FDA discussing approving EUA order preserve integrity placebo groups blinded trials run 24 months. expect widespread vaccine anywhere spring. shame recognizing priorities. There's nothing inherently wrong selfish it. Child free people, especially child free women, capable whole fulfilled humans. Live best life (to best ability shit show pandemic) words exact words misled public.  never okay.  

And like said, advise people wear face coverings, like came said long said masks helpful. 

Any way put it, CDC misled people purpose. believe ever happen. Nah, spitting facts. Los Angeles, 90%+ mask compliance; however, 1 2 people actually wear mask properly cover nose. Nearly half people wear masks leaving nose completely uncovered.

A mask mandate nothing. Good luck, fam. FWIW sister covid pregnant baby fine now. Delivery service companies like support piece information. listened listening now? honest you’re one read comment, stuck fingers ears said lalalal began fit. would need mandate mask virus survival rate 98-99% depending age group. I’ll tell why, it’s power play. You’ll see election covid talks disappear. March? restart now? Name calling lol No. admit argument doomsday one based sound science fact? Eradication practically impossible, especially vaccines don’t work (as scenario described). 

There 8 billion people world. Even every country got reported cases 0 longer period (which unlikely: Argentina, example, soaring numbers infected even though they’ve lockdown since March), takes one single person, 8 billion, somewhere world, send us back current situation within months. 

And that’s even addressing fact virus first came circulation jumping animal, what’s say won’t again? 

We eradicated one endemic disease, ever. decades decades aggressive vaccination effective vaccine. Oh black people can't read now? quoted you, fucking racist Ohhh Fauci needs anger translater. also explain risks kids watching teachers die knowing might one get teacher sick? Memes traded credibility many statement royally fucked up. People always point say “what else lying about” 

He 100% upfront. No, land fuck got mine

 #1 reason knew America gonna way fucked Asia January Without government's declaration lockdown, way impose punitive measures lockdown breakers potential virus spreaders.

There stories infamous rule breakers. example, Taiwanese businessman evaded quarantine summoned prostitute. published part contact tracing procedure. Science facts. care feelings. also say makes highly effective. Can’t governors state level? point you’re risking lives people needlessly can’t wait months. I’m going shame since you’re probably impervious it. That’s don’t venture out. thank you, hills eyes. current administration plan. got open Tor (with lot add-ons) ....

He literally stated said try keep US purchasing PPE needed doctors. again. are, said reply, using numbers. Check post details dates used example latest population figures. 9 months population. saying either one right still comparing apples apple. Don’t accuse someone fudging numbers can’t even get basics methodology right.

He extrapolate September’s numbers entire year, kidding me? Read wrote try again. 

I’m checking night now. case positively rate less 2% eat doors  surprise. Ohio family living like there's nothing going on, posting photos indoor parties dining, dancing bands, etc. Cull stupid 2020 aka you. difference population density. Weird seem assume poor = promiscuous.

I saying that. think misunderstood comment. Thanks compliment though appreciate it. Politics info well Political figure 2 different things imo. see rarely political discussions post non US politicans. possible. What? provided source start thread. official government data. claim data hoax, without arguments. claim Swedish government agencies conspiracy fudge numbers purpose. onus prove anything you. lmao wont shit reddit nerd, youre scared &lt;1% death rate virus, wont confront anyone, especially violence. What’s fucking plan, seriously? I’m bad year I’m hearing anything US going curb this. plan basically vaccinate? said America first response would “What vaccine?” “T****s vaccine poison!” Please add BREAKING headline

We learned people could asymptomatic still spread it, meaning self quarantine / isolation got sick partially effective. vital understanding Fauci said did. could spread COVID showing symptoms, masks really important - ensuring people sick got properly isolated was. know spread without person knowing, need constant hours make notification public, get every federal agency find every PPE available acquire it.

Its like enough PPE problem aquiring all: enough supply even bought. wait produced. takes lot longer 24hrs national scale. imaginary scenario nuts.

Never fan delta, mind changed.

Jetblue delta go Hi, also live Sweden big issue spike virus hit elderhomes. Comparing Norway less half Swedens population fair. 

With said it’s winning anything right strategy. find years come strategy data collected.

For future generations Studies showing conflicting results ain’t new. Unless it’s magic bullet stuff (they’re rare) often depends endpoints chosen subjects enrolled. It’s reading things using information headache. 

As results pile start getting better idea drug works, disease develop etc try identify circumstances might help.  think we’re gonna break 80k first time today. Already 72 majority Cali 3 large counties Texas yet report Stupid shitty people. timing restrictions early march, thats it. Norway Sweden similar approaches Also usa, never tested. failed state He’s going that, he’s crystal clear Dr. Levine don’t think that’s necessary since we’re better equipped handle surge. People need smart wear mask, avoid gathering important reason. First step: born rich. Sounds easy enough. Well guess everyone got mostly successful surgery good story it. Rural hospitals, rationed drugs, nursing homes hit yet getting now.  2 area past 3 weeks. 100 cases one (6 deaths far) 60 cases (1 death far it’s newer outbreak) build walls around states stupid shit make hard rest country? think it’s much likely people give let virus spread getting civil war Hospitalizations also sharply rising too.

[Total currently hospitalized broken saw [WaPo earlier today stating hospitalizations rising 38 states. Yikes  What’s bid deal asking people smart holidays? Remember horrified South Korea first reported hundred cases day back February? That’s large group idiots works one mean would work rest. imagine people insane negative effects thing? 🤔 We're turning corner, going away. Whose house? used hope that, think possible now. spreads slow enough keep moving people annual basis, seems likely immunity/protection last 6 months year infection, maybe 2 lucky ones. Indeed, misattribution what's happening fit data have. Urban areas large populations working poor always disproportionately damaged economic downturns. people predominantly located? Chicago, LA, NY, etc.

So, factual - unemployment still falling NY, state things control, counterfactual - unemployment rising open states continued elevated spread. **If restrictions cause, we'd see opposite.** Every ""open"" state continued spread hit wall like FL GA have, every state proportion population start spending feel safe. It’s really tightly enclosed space. I’ve donated blood twice since March I’m donating November. We’re fairly large spaces (think community rooms) 10 feet apart everyone except you’re speaking phlebotomist they’re actually something blood aka inserting needle. EVERYONE masked, properly. Appointments required well. They’re everything possible keep donors safe. Fair enough, 83k cases testing capacity still terrible. North DaCovid That's pretty much untrue. go.

From January mask really keep catching answer that, helps clarify kinds masks we're talking experts yet know exactly virus transmitted, **Centers Disease Control Prevention recommending health care workers treat like airborne pathogen** — germs travel particles droplets air. means health care workers interacting coronavirus patient wear heavy-duty mask called N95 respirator. **These respirators designed fit tightly around nose mouth, and, worn correctly, block least 95% small airborne particles, according contrast, surgical masks — cheap, disposable, gauzy masks often come blue green — less uncomfortable.

Surgical masks loose-fitting, compared tight fitting N95 respirators. **Surgical masks also don’t fully protect people inhaling smaller airborne particles, unlike respirators filter least 95 percent airborne particles.** CDC also notes comes new coronavirus people wear face mask they’re experiencing symptoms investigated possibly believe could spread among asymptomatic people either.

It’s really simple people don’t test don’t cases! long til it’s 100,000 day? lot wealthy middle class white people become doctors nurses smart interested medicine wanting help people, mommy daddy afford pay schooling want good paying job social status working medical profession provides. (though usually choice) prefer medical staff working immigrants and/or nonwhite.  lol. And. Happy Cake Day! Winter coming....... RemindMe! 18 days foresee lot travel plans India near future.

... lot folks refused entry, disease. look area curve. Daily case numbers snapshot. intervening months Italy like 100 cases day 70,000 thousand meant thousand people died would lived. people still mattered. Please judge kind symptoms psychosomatic easily. Interesting, Holy shit insane false equivalence.

The data doesn’t say all. remember back January first started following virus. roughly 18k cases China one two scattered countries. followed closely planning going India end Feb unsure wise do. Anyways, time, would ask ex “what get locked down” etc., would scoff say would never happen live. Yet are. knew would get relatively big US thought would mostly large cities, would get contained spread nationwide, impacting Americans. foolish. BNO says hit 83,000. Yes, probably bother them. Either knew, ready big settlement, know, we're surprised were. ways interested money. Coming saying mainstream product unsafe recall products quickly cheap either J&amp;J would still lots trouble. extremely unethical.

Now vaccine gonna checked thoroughly massive trial check safe works. able make lots money it, plus gives lots good publicity. Stay home US never enforced Remember almost went war Iran? I'm sorry, age globalism, accept collectivism trumps (haha) individualism. ++ Science consensus, specific studies. overwhelming majority studies point one direction other, we're likely consensus. 

Unfortunately, really hard reach consensus technologies still new -- new applications old technologies -- long-term studies nigh impossible. Therefore, least interim, important patient *freedom choose.* 

Of course, also requires *informed consent,* one wonder informed ever *really* be. are! Texas Evangelical brother sez, oh, it'll go away *after election* cuz Democratic hoax. vaginal steaming happens yearly naturally July. n95 probably fend tunafishy miasma Shits rough everyone. gotta do. fact Doom Gloom Headlines get rewards subreddit joke. Humanity reached rock bottom Hopefully protect us lol P Try again... already linked above, actual reputable source...

Our case fatality rate lower yours. 

That's fact.

So would superior healthcare mean higher chance death covid? :) Source 20%? Last checked pushing 20% areas like hard hit neighborhoods NYC. generally healthy people lazy. 

I get flu shot every year I’m marginally higher risk (auto immune, immunomodulatirs/suppressants yet) managed talk husband getting one year I’m pregnant. 

He’s anti vaccine all, young, healthy lazy. Saw video earlier today. That's shame. Hopefully Oxford University vaccine pan out. meantime, 5000 IU Vitamin D3 180 mcg Vitamin K2 MK7 per day, along intelligent behavior wearing masks buildings home maintaining distance others. I'll glad longer need honestly, I'm used now. part daily routine consider like ball chain tied me. ironic China also vaccine almost certainly first complete Phase 3. curious though, check stroke related not?  Yeah, agree. take precise guess, I’d say 2.5x maybe 3x death toll claimed Iranian Government. Totally, like South Park episode inject Kyle shredded cash fight AIDS. Ain't nobody got kind money, except maybe Jerome Powell magical money printer. Glad hear you’ve recovered! guys lingering issues? scares started following closely 2nd week January. Honestly imagine getting point back then.  83,000! Jesus Christ! We're going hit 100,000 maybe next week. Temporal disintegration.  Ah yes begin think actual implementation issues policy. convenient. It’s really hard fully grasp terrifying live country live see vitriol hate towards Americans eyes. I’m exhausted, really don’t think stay forever. I’m ashamed american. want vaccine approved soon Mid November nobody taking shit seriously   beyond tripping that's exactly t-cell activation reinfection stands beyond rare probably happen 99.9% people Damn men brother colonoscopies together? /s major European countries getting hit hard right now? full anti-maskers America? something else? something else behind America's surge well? surprised see numbers overseas. Itll gone summer, see. well 100,000 cases/day late March/April Compare covid twin brother SARS, common cold. SARS immune response 17 years. Israel 10k cases last month, adjusting US population size that’s 400k, honestly 80k doesn’t sound much. lockdown immediately happened though keep stats that... detailed stats... It'll mid 2022 anything normal truth isn’t popular US right Actually GA creeping almost month. consistent like bad sign. CA, live, started trend week ago. worries. putting there. Glad air quality better safe sound pace, every single American going get end next year US population: 330,000,000
Estimated survival rate: 99.4%

If assume 80% population eventually exposed due carelessness, means 1 million people US could die COVID-19. 

Is ok books? many much you? 

Thats people individual population 8 different states.

No big right? Fucking exactly.  


My wife wearing masks alot we've noticed allergies lot less severe year. We're starting think there's something this. Fuck everyone else thinks, may wear masks pandemic over. LMAO, sheeple actually fall scamdemic LIE. low zero

yeah stepping outside wrong area, say, next person eating chips hour, there's nothing it

yeah whole point study spread minimal masking rigid urge airlines strict requirements

basically article telling us much anything new. maybe strict, almost major cities, people could leave homes every three days. Work suspended, etc. lockdown.

How videos saw huge cities like Shanghai Nanjing empty streets? eyes lying me?

And friend mine China time job, happened vacationing Hangzhou Covid hit - kept going back hotel/base Nanjing three whole weeks. Put hotel. previous post another thread, get cold numerous times life. Getting doesn’t mean can’t get despite immune recognition second third fourth time get it. mask usage necessary. Without mask certain cases dead next day sooner. Sand blasting one.  use phrase I'm talking music composition/production. Lots power several tracks lined blend perfect simultaneously. Usually great thing; Covid. Covid stacked waves k thanks. Even national mandate would require enforcement. 

Would see police every corner keeping eye everyone? Would Biden Trump send Feds mayors governors enforce mandate? can't imagine positive response threats withhold aid. Trump: ""we're rounding corner.""  Trump doesnt need spin election anyone knows fucked are.... cool. lets say get super mild. maybe even asymptomatic. rate spread 3, meaning could spread 3 people, spread 3 people. happens 10 times, youve infected 59,000 people. compare influenza, rate spread 1.5, 10 times youve infected 57 people.


this isnt well-being, well-being everyone around you.  thing is, based I've read, I'm willing tentatively accept flying commercial passenger jet could low risk. that's really issue, all. 

It's 3 hours airport scares hell me. correct. I’m sorry. It’s not. cell activation doesn’t mean person can’t get reinfected infect others asymptomatically. Neither prove long term organ stress damage can’t come second reinfection. truth still don’t know lot virus believing get can’t get plain wrong. parties

3 years prison honestly gotta crazy think Obama would shut country. feel sad you. there's nothing better could've done. Wish gf speedy recovery. People idea China contain covid, welding everyone apartments. Watch  
  
it filmed japanese filmmaker employees nanjing can't imagine picking worse hill die on. He's wrong every level, there's way he'll ever seen anything wrong, tiny mind. Second wave? fucken tsunami! safe bet  lady yelling grocery store wasn’t wearing mask... wrong? prefer keep settings 60 FPS CFR unless CPU running hot switch variable frame rate We'll get this. Stay safe good luck guys America. Still idiots won’t wear masks social distance. point sympathy took appropriate precautions still got infected. you’re going way avoid sound, evidence based medical advice can’t feel sorry you. Literally went skiing last days February. remember seeing bunch screens COVID information airport waiting go customs. That’s one last “pre-pandemic” memories. 

Only tiny amount people wearing masks. Boy, lucky never came anything  Sure is.

Incompetent governance.

The places locked early ridiculed mocked people power virus spread throughout country. spread went couple rocks tossed pond handfuls pebbles.

2 hotspots became 4 became 16 on. US became borderline worst case scenario virus. Every state either ""steady bad place"" rising going flu season.

This going fucked winter. May odds ever favor. Sorry champ, ride rounds corner over. correct. Believe me. Whoever you’re responding getting obvious point. Well yeah, CFR several flaws(not epidemiologist however)

- test policy availability.(who get tested)

- Like said lag infection death however I’d imagine easy compensate historical data, looking averages etc. 

- controversial know cause death policy guidelines.

That’s scientists try estimate IFR papers account issues CFR flawed number. following fixed set rules: country certain frequency cases positivity rates, travel advice automatically changed they'd fall ""no go"" metrics.

These irrespective situation home, basically applications rules set earlier, automatic triggers etc.

There's asinine intent. People idea China contain covid, welding everyone apartments. Watch  
  
it filmed japanese filmmaker employees nanjing That's absolutely ridiculous told detail. I'd happy expand even more, blunders. held back. No, third wave involves aliens. seems local health departments making orders US, thing missing actual enforcement funny thing is, retained open borders, really lock down, yet insanely low cases deaths. fucking everyone wears mask, like 100 years, see common courtesy infect people around get sick. novel fucking GODDAMN CONCEPT. FUCK. healthcare worker (NY) sickens me.  minds going go immediately ""THE GOVERNMENT'S TRYING CONTROL ME!"" somebody argue day giant social experiment everybody sensitive 95% people OK yadda yadda yadda. 

It's really deep. wear mask minutes move day. also untrue. medical insurance money drugs (Regeneron) gave Trump given handful people. escaping Mr. Corona's Wild Ride. SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea warned citizens stay indoors, saying seasonal yellow dust blowing China might carry new coronavirus “As new coronavirus infections continue spread around world, need deal yellow dust take thorough measures become critical,” North Korea’s official party newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday.

I guess effectively confirms that, official claims zero cases contrary, we're someday going find DPRK truly horrific local epidemic. lockdown outside Wuhan. CVS locations near testing? took - gave - contactless test drive thru window recently potential exposure. able fill paperwork online, schedule soon later day got results 48 hrs weekend. definitely budget. Luckily air quality back normal now. Hopefully I’ll able get one future. Unfortunately far I'm aware. missed 2-4 month window (which anyone infected early probably antibody tests took months start showing up) think luck. Dude say “we everything right, masks etc.“? 

That misleading heck. Edit previous comment please. know conspiracy video created falun gong right? Go back watch again. Pay attention editing. high-effort video required scouring Weibo maybe youku countless hours.  
   
The FLG funded US state department. Google search epoch times + trump.  
  
The 5G causes covid may originated FLG/Epoch Times well. google search, epoch times 5g, see bash lot talking unsafe is. 5G invented China leased Ericcson US obviously want China succeed economically, especially high tech stuff. knew America societal fractures, believe many Americans would little empathy fellow Americans, fellow humans. Yikes Yes. Illegal gatherings. fucking pandemic. hosting parties. see 1m dead US over. massively ignorant true infection fatality rates? Trump's response excellent. saved 2.2 million people. Good thing many states change vote. Won’t holidays mom ever again, yea... doesn’t seem unreasonable safe cautions compared alternative I’m living. I’d much rather reduced contact another year, still mom around long term 🤷‍♀️ I'm sure like demographic, spectrum people take seriously easily laugh all.

The ones I'd met years seemed like good people, friendly, taking offense easily intend offend.  guys easy dealing summer. pathogen dies lot quicker fomites due Sun heat. winter coming along, really begins Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years. that's interesting idea, think really explains happened.

The numbers births constant Baby Boom, constant later? Check graphs third page article Census Bureau. Keep mind average age women first birth go 1970.

As non-demographic factors might influenced birth rates end Gen X, remember decade kind crappy economically. Oil Crisis (with gasoline rationing!) recession/stagflation 1973-75. also legalization birth control unmarried people (its uniformly legal married people 1965!) restrictions abortions lifted people greater control whether actually wanted kids *right now*. Confused warm/cold months matter? 

Like, quarantine, masks... americans dumb shit matter weather “Months school year, school reopenings across United States remain patchwork plans: in-person, remote hybrid; masked not; socially distanced not. amid jumble, one clear pattern emerging.

So far, schools seem stoking community transmission coronavirus, according data emerging random testing United States Britain. Elementary schools especially seem seed remarkably infections.

The evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. School reopenings much work progress. Still, many experts encouraged results date.”

Source: That's bad talking point. 2.2 million deaths would've happened allowed virus go unchecked infect everyone. would've criminal this. Every government expected something. Trump's response bad around. lying American public repeatedly risks posed virus knew infectious weeks advance. obstructing pushes Americans wear masks almost every single time chance. he's trying sell lie cure COVID-19. even attend meetings coronavirus task force anymore. silly behavior caused many needless deaths.  anyone surprised...? I’ll try find come back provide link, (Singaporean believe) banks large exercise everyone practiced working home due mock “virus” October 2019. Part exercise dealing attack insider everyone working home.

I think even backstory disgruntled employee told bankers know exactly people hate response increase security. right remember alone feeling. People waking seeing bullshit. want life back now. Fuck new normal. right. saying things sure change time frame, people seem understand two months terms pandemic time actually really long curious guys think reason politicians get different care everyone else? like there's secret drug access too. Truth matter would get exact care them. Even experimental drugs regular people access to.

I understand people think narrative true. Yeah like 4th wave.. long continuous never ending 1st wave Thank battling people. They've gotten confident delusions. think might lost mate, thread covid Mask up, America. daily case loads high simply impossible trace. Korea best tracing system world would smashed bits useless face American per capita daily cases. Maybe athletes participating college football, MLB, NBA, NFL, wrestling, UFC worn masks playing sports. Seems would set great example hindering performance. know really dumb question, everyone saying it'll worse winter? disease spread cold? becoming clear ~~court systems are~~ *entire country is* capable handling domestic crisis *or caring neighbors.* 

FTFY. dumb comment. covid19 less 1% Infection Fatality Rate. ebola. gf part 83k. Got tests back 2 hrs ago. She’s upstairs 101 fever, asleep I’m deck dog terrified might feel wake tomorrow.

Exactly. 200 000 confirmed cases nearly almost 200 000 cases March/April. Need recalibrate view numbers. March/April entirely different level we're seeing now. Number true infections fraction comparison. Still governments implementing similar measures based levels number confirmed cases March/April, disregarding fact countries entirely different situation right now. Restrictive measures situations hospitals running capacity. Hospitals Europe close capacity right now. Implementing strict measures strictly necessary leads loss legitimacy, problem cases rise point need people follow strict measures. I’m El Paso. People don’t care. Going out, masks, seeing family. city leaders said won’t anything. It’s really scary sucks. Sturgis South Dakota, North Dakota think idiots allowing rally happen. hospitals people coming different issues don’t even realize Covid hospital tests it.

Here article explains recomendations many countries, Sweden used laws decrees key tool fighting coronavirus pandemic, instead relying individuals taking responsibility. so-called recommendations optional basis law.

Firstly, important emphasise guidelines place Sweden introduced protect public health. choosing follow could put health health around risk, regardless potential legal consequences.

Government-imposed laws

The Swedish strategy relied mostly 'voluntary' measures, entirely.

A restrictions temporary laws, October 21st include ban public events 50 people, special restrictions restaurants (including obligation ensure one-metre distance groups measures prevent crowding).

These could change future. October 1st, national ban visits elderly care homes, government announced plans ease restrictions public events.

People break rules could face legal sanctions, depending law relate to. 

For example, people organise gatherings 50 people violating Public Order Act, could face fines even imprisonment six months. Police power shut gatherings.

In case restaurants, inspections coordinated municipality. business found violating the temporary law (currently place least December 31st, 2020), municipality order close prove made necessary adjustments, impose sanctions.

Between normalcy state emergency: legal framework Sweden's coronavirus strategy


National recommendations Public Health Agency

The bulk Sweden's coronavirus measures form of allmänna råd, literally translates 'general recommendations'. Local, chosen translate primarily 'recommendations' 'binding recommendations', sometimes 'rules' expectation everyone following basis law.

Some national recommendations apply businesses outline measures shops, workplaces, sports facilities example taking reduce spread infection. Others apply individuals.

The recommendations themselves, frequent hand-washing, working home possible, staying home showing symptoms, keeping distance others public, laws. One reason using loosely worded recommendations, greater flexibility people decide best apply rules circumstances. assumes individuals take responsibility. 

So example, individuals employers decide extent working home possible, everyone keep distance others much possible, rather Sweden naming distance kept public specific professions exempted home-working happened elsewhere.

When asked media specificity apply guidelines certain situations, Public Health Agency tended emphasise importance individuals taking responsibility. make confusing individuals, particularly different regions businesses chosen interpret guidelines different ways. example, workplace requires go workplace even though could work home, legal right refuse, even though goes the allmänna råd.

Working Sweden: boss force return office?


Although room variation interpret guidelines, Sweden's Communicable Disease Act, law, requires everyone Sweden ""take reasonable precautions curb spread infectious diseases"". actions ""reasonable"" take depend circumstances individual Swedish society whole, the allmänna råd issued Public Health Agency show us agency considers ""reasonable"".

It possible prosecuted Communicable Disease Act found infected others coronavirus either knowingly negligence; applies socially dangerous diseases HIV. could face investigation get tested coronavirus even repeatedly called test, example via contact tracing.

But general, unlikely face legal consequences failing comply with allmänna råd, example go work despite possible work home, organise private party fail keep distance public.

Coronavirus: rules recommendations Sweden now?

Local recommendations response outbreaks

As October 19th, also possible individual regions stricter recommendations imposed judged necessary handling local outbreaks.

Uppsala became first region introduce extra local restrictions October 20th, included urging people avoid public transport, avoid physical contact people outside household, avoid arranging organising parties social gatherings. Stricter recommendations also introduced shops businesses region.

In ways, significantly different national recommendations, urge people limit social contacts avoid 'large' gatherings, well choose means travel public transport possible keep distance others public transport.

At press conference announcing measures, authorities stressed extra important follow existing national recommendations Uppsala, working home possible.

The restrictions Uppsala also allmänna råd, legal basis national recommendations. words, optional, sanctions follow them./// I’ve really surprised repulsed zoom. thought I’d zooming friends this. reality, meetings pretty much limit. I’m boat, drinking weight gain loss. Loss due exercising like crazy, gain due surgery. I’m fucking done caring. remember US 9000 someone replied comment made said stone cold sober US would pass 15,000 fatalities. look up. Underfunding problem indeed find every politician cut, disease hits health system world withstand intensive care requires. damage? “Oh I’m suffering”. Crybaby Cases cases. Show death count month. Yeah we'll hit spring numbers terms death. have. parents California dad's job kept trying get come home. finally got flight home first week March. Begged wear masks home said did. dad survived stroke 10 years ago mom renal cancer. super lax stressful part whole pandemic. Also, science seem strong suit lot people area. knew screwed first local positive case discharged hospital prior results coming back tested positive flu first. many people screaming impossible both. Apparently learned opportunistic infections. Yeah remember website open tracked covid cases, 500 point. Slowly day crept up. much later livestream updates on. problem approach work, humans far impatient. long term flattening would mean majority population stays home self quarantine unless absolutely go essentials. weeks, maybe even months, indefinitely long enough see widespread vaccine usage antibody responses. test trace contain, can’t. IHME us half estimated infections March/April.

The main problem shut country stop spike back then. That's going happen time around. That’s concerns India - lot friends work colleagues there, it’s story they’re telling me. careful want, living Mumbai Delhi there’s people everywhere, way ensure you’re safe interaction outside world. 

I wonder though, federal government able enforce mask rule, whether local government could better, reasons preventing so, say, local govt don’t think it’s worth it. hope family keep safer, Reddit friend. think beat India highest increase 97000 September 11th according Worldometers We’re number 1! Oh we’re bending curve alright. Bending upward :( final approval, both. known study peer reviewed yet. Same. went medication October 2018, OCD symptoms almost completely disappeared (with flare lasting week sometimes), like progress erased months ago, lockdown really started getting me..

OCD sucks. university students flew school fall dispersing back homes might another major source spread. We're already seeing third wave, would guess pandemic fatigue going get worse. Almost sounds reaching. Ask anyone random, they'll probably new symptom *some* severity past months. read there's 3 types abortion allowed. mothers life danger, pregnancy rape unborn child deformed. removing last reason. able abort deformed survive. diseases happen small percentage pregnancies result child still born surviving leaves womb, meaning mothers would carry baby full term knowing die arms minutes born.
 Edit word. Instead asking Biden VP 8 years, people ask Pence so-called covid19 task force past 8 months.  get warnings like considered helpful. People mentally exhausted, pushing back hard ever making situation worse(look Europe right rule USA comes undisputed #1 world records again) - make public statement telling pain even half over? bound waste 2021 too? 2020 enough?

I saying stop social distancing - reinforce idea. Keep explaining people important NOW. come say yea, 2021 gone guys, cya 2022 lucky. would edge mentally, would push edge I'd crack. stop 'death sentences' already, take step step. Haha considering 2nd surge picked right beginning summer.. totally screwed pooch that.

Southern states start seeing cooler weather soon... First major cold front weekend Texas. suspect we're going see 6-figure daily cases November. people going bars months places allowed, new thing, schools open months too. Cold weather one thing looks like new variable, really took? Yikes Yeah Kentucky done amazing jobs keeping numbers low daily deaths single digits.

Again, I’m bashing adenoviral vector vaccine. However, biotech virologist, little concerned mass vaccination type. Sure, planning traveling abroad somewhere Ebola present, take vaccine get specialized clinic. 

If producing vaccine administered tens hundreds millions people non healthcare workers pharmacy techs volunteers, think need go vaccine likely fewest adverse events possible. 

Would get Astra Zeneca vaccine another adenoviral vector based vaccine? Yes. think potentially less risky alternatives? Yes. worry public backlash vaccines one adverse events administered 70 million people would cause people forego vaccine? Yes.  remember getting mocked early March saying US would get 3,000 cases/day May. I'm tired. come contact many people day public-facing job anxiety absolutely rails. virus would play nice health stuff I've got deal with. Hospitals ""over run"", media likes try hype it.

Its due shortage intensive care beds. hospitals 10 beds 100s normal beds. beds quickly fill up. 

Many hospitals already running skeleton staff, shortage nurses etc.

Even Biden wins take office January 20th. holidays happen Trump. thought still first wave. habits people anything else. Winter means lot time spent indoors.. cold climates, little time outdoors. greatly increases transmission pathways people enclosed relatively close proximity eachother. 

Family gatherings holidays also _not_ going help.  I’d say we’ve done pretty well last 250,000 years. We’ve survived long, survived worse COVID. Preach.

Dude, fearmongering. action deliberately arousing public fear alarm particular issue.

Please shush let adults talk. play brother sister kids table. Ill bring crayons. Highly restrictive measures largely dropped European countries following Spring. countries, Hungary Czechia never really hit virus all. summer tourism travel, somewhat muted, went essentially normal, we're seeing results well loose controls.

The United States different track. states hit hardest right never experienced surges way New York Sun Belt first second spikes respectively. California, Florida, Texas never got control outbreaks.

I really surprised Europe. I'll hold die there's nothing special American culture making inclined suffer things like this, least European countries. many areas, especially California, measures restrictive European country post lockdown. Mask compliance, believe not, high California, much much higher many European countries. Nevertheless California awful numbers, since June. NPIs like masks social distancing designed end pandemic. They're mitigation tools used flatten curve vaccine made available. Forget that! I'm moving families self sustaining ranch TX. like living 1 HR metroplex. push comes shove go take reins family. Figure things sit roof snipe ppl to. Texas way. Still sad Grandpa died sell small part land 350k primo real estate. worth much that. 
I Texan first, American 2nd. Stuck Midwest making plans gtfo. FFS people taking post wrong way. 

This disease nation ending. mean serious think federal government state governments good job USA. think states citizens preparing rough winter try mitigate much possible. 

It means incredibly dramatic say would end nation. think fragile something mortality rate would end nation. 

If want buy much gloom guest, nation stable nations survive pandemic. community spread goal. We’ve six days community spread we’re close opening up. Stay home scared wear mask. Serial killers sound interesting, &amp; brand things spawned year LPNs NPs completely different. LPNs considerably less training registered nurses associate degree, NPs least Masters degree. said, PA NP day week.  seriously think huge majority China practises TCM?

Nope. didn’t say that, don’t think it’s accurate. 

If lie someone said make point, shouldn’t comment first place. getting ur info serpentza? 

I don’t know means. laughable ignorant are

Given write feel pretty comfortable ignoring this. antibody test December?

Are left Obama too? Mr. Bones wild ride Schools baby sitting institutions influence mind control. Education shouldn’t cost money really want educate them. local news station tracked number cases since first one. remember one, 4, 18... 24000. Back February, high school students asking it. believed big deal would never come area. told end year would know someone would probably know someone died it. know three people died it, one currently hospitalized. know someone it. first week March, superintendent told believed political hoax. told would missing substantial time school, soon. next week spring break, didn’t go back August. wasn’t kind fortune teller, pay attention. people didn’t. still people area refuse wear mask. think might reading different scientific journals. I’ll air side caution. well stay safe everyone that, they'd kill virus 6 weeks like China/Australia/NZ. wait till mid 2021.... we'd eliminate time Xmas. But, hey, lets - Xmas rolls' around, everyone's grandmas start dying. govt already control many ways, tell look law book don’t know you’re kids back look post history six months ago going say “everyone going get anyway”?

I’m going to, I’m saying - exact words repeating literally problem exists first place. Yeah, that's patient sexual partner put object there. person claiming patient's *doctor* put tennis ball patient. scared go church. maybe case. Sounds like intense experience. child taken away put back parent seem fit seems incredibly hard. That's main thing scares fostering. Glad found child. Abraham Lincoln said go away... Well done recovery friend, I’m starting mine, can’t keep drinking away problems trying stave withdrawal every damn day!  watched damn movie, woke next morning first case COVID US 120 miles me! surreal. putting much effort going “fearmongering” then? Take meds, get sleep something. Yep, China dust. /s Got where? soon things open could start again. mean, France strict effective lockdown drastically reduced high case numbers quickly. Now, months later, things worse they've ever been. made definitely true statement people money get first. Wealthy privilege infiltrates every aspect society. That's media thinking people idiots. wear masks gyms months now. get 1rm bench press mask on. absolutely problem wearing masks. Stay home sick. Watching US implode due hubris getting old. Greatest country earth amirite? Americans special kind stupid. side side many tests administered Thanks. was/am ignorant law situations.

My friend company every need right use number masks.

Remarkably, work doubled pandemic. more. guess lot clients putting demo/renovation work saw opportunity.

He busier ever making money ever. happy wish true everyone. Plus cold weather better spreading viruses. What’s relationship cold weather transmission? happened me. eaten restaurant, pleasure shopped, done anything really public since March. 

Got diagnosed 3 weeks ago (luckily severe) I'm honestly trying figure got it. 

We recently bought new house workers come make repairs, one wearing mask assuming got him.  You’d lose bet far. 

Of things listed, drunk driving kills most, it’s 10,000 deaths per year doesn’t hold candle 220,000 people Covid killed thanks moronic people refuse wear masks. one sterilise thing covered weird felt stuff?

If possible sterile medical packing scaffolding couriered practice, many sterile wound dressings used packing would available pharmacy.

It astonishing medical professional would try tennis ball unless literally wilderness extreme situation. Merica No.1, hop want. source article B News can’t even tell fake is. 

Just kidding, believe science neature fucking lit...I mean neat.

Better influence whatever spell is.  Q? Q who? star trek?

Or trying infer Q-anon right wing nut?

What say thats true? dont care bullshit conspiracy theory 4ch0n user says. Unfortunately, many states (that seeing surges right now) allowed packed churches Easter. bunch never church restrictions all. almost like listening heeding advice experts infectious diseases. I’ll preface saying normally dislike alarmists acting like one. going get pretty bad. 

This holiday season going perfect storm pandemic. People hitting pandemic fatigue simultaneously wanting social. 

People let guard visit family/friends, stay indoors weather, infect others without knowing. 

This bound skyrocket deaths. trump made sure post longer filled.

THIS post?? FFS, google ‘trump unfilled positions’. judge, vacancy. rate we'll probably hit US death rate higher WW2 inauguration. immediately inauguration, sean hannity tucker carlson air explaining exactly deaths biden administrations fault somehow.  placebo That's stupidly aggressive denial there. I'm sorry. I’m expert obviously expect? known get go push hard long people gonna start protesting ultimately refuse comply new lockdowns. you’re running money force shut business virus becomes secondary. you’re gonna care anymore. There’s always tipping point. 

The lockdowns stop right now, potential cause unprecedented unrest. see first protester beaten death police? see first policeman beaten death angry mob? We’ve already seen clashes happening several countries. It’s slippery slope, that’s I’m saying. ...Nice? We're fucked fucked Hope it’s ECQ, MECQ, GCQ, MGCQ ‘New Normal’ like Philippines. Scotland forever. Ask Filipino... It’s anti-lockdown Swedes I’d like stick finger to, it’s conservative Trump voters using Sweden bastion epidemiology go around without masks gather big groups, infecting rest American communities. Sweden alone failing experiment big, rippling letdown one major argument right wing go around screaming fighting wearing masks public. argument finished. could get safer it. 230 thousand people small fraction world.

The needs many, outweigh needs few.

So tell guy. Im gonna give 350million M&amp;Ms. Lets say 1% deadly. Would completely stop eating M&amp;Ms rest life? Maybe! M&amp;Ms life? cant survive without them. Thats like right LOT people. Everyone seems think dying worst thing happen right now. not. 80 year old might died 10 years now, instead yesterday, today, single mom 2 jobless state instituted lockdowns kids need home school cant make rent darned anti-eviction thing went window.

We dont make rules society based around smallest groups. pick helps *most* people.

Now, yall go crazy - Im saying dont wear mask social distance whatever. hate masks Im damned sure gonna wear one go shop costco. 

All Im saying end day - drop water bucket deaths every day, nothing shut life hypothetical aimed specifically

You didnt stop driving cars car fatalities? didnt stop eating junk food candy dietbetus? didnt stop smoking cigs cancer?

Risks life. think virus insane. Im gonna stop life it. Im gonna take care body, take immune supplements, wear mask, need to, pay bills take care gf cats. forget mask car day went vet - jailed fined? *COULD KILLED SOMEONE?* Build wall! Build wall! Build wall!

Never thought would chsnt need build wall keep diseaes ridden entitled inside. remember live countries re-explore love...

...or go hate filled America prop regime run parties. phrase actually “for intents purposes”, genius That’s exactly keep seeing people. Dead alive consideration long term health and, possible, economic effects related virus. Another thing burns ass focus people number “recovered”. SIL considered recovered due fact longer testing positive, it’s hard consider someone situation recovered. moving goalposts to, 'oh well increase death rate February I'm wrong' ridiculous nonsense. 

You know makes mutation notable? fucking effect moron. **last** mutation effect virus *started* circulating since massive spread infection millions, **NOTABLE** changes seen affect transmission, evasion, several mutations noted.

Okay, so? could develop asshole elbow mutation - useful doesnt help you. understood virology could see virus go many many variations one sticks one replicates. we've seen failed copies, *does mean* worth damn.

This entire fucking thread fearmongering. 83k new cases!! Yet IFR low. trying scare?? trying prove? virus **DEADLY EVERYONE EVERYTHING??** gonna encounter new form COVID thats even deadlier before????

^^^According ^^^to ^^^that ^^^article ^^^- ^^^nope  That'd super dope. extremely frustrating. hope S.O get better!
I recently got Covid even though rarely going always wearing mask. contract cousin take precautions play video games brother. He's asymptomatic still enjoying life lingering cough headache. 
Its disappointing. uncle died start year pneumonia. job included meeting lots lots people. coronavirus panic, took 2 weeks cough death. statistics though actually likely coronavirus yet dead. think theres people like that. Why? China forced extreme lockdowns early. Armed guards every apartment door etc etc. wife’s parents live China it’s essentially back normal precautionary measures like wearing masks you’re checking temperatures restaurants. 

This dismissive attitude bullshit arguments breathing CO2 instead O2 USA loosing battle COVID-19.

Edit: adding this. China SARS deal with. learned lot manage situations. like Singapore (where live) solid plan place next SARS would happen again. Yea, fucked execution overlooking scenario came back us ass recovered also back normal. Get think head part solution problem. Good try little buddy. We’re dot i. Someone get here. know man, family members live rural Utah say see Mormon gatherings time masks. change indoor religious services summer.

 actually relatives' biggest worry already spreading churches soon. cite biggest community threat identify. People know dead might disagree you. 
How many know? Awesome! Good ✌🏼 summer there. Yep. Even Prof. Drosten said second wave inevitable likely lot harder first wave. mean, Swede seems cold hearted approach health ministry spring feeling correct. really hard control populations long time restrictions seems. Especially pandemic relatively mild age groups. Winter coming. Yeah things worked surprisingly well, especially retrospect. happy I'm Korea back home states. Happy birthday It’s funny really getting hit harder moment, went state state terms “who hate week”. one particular handled well unless want talk Taiwan, love Taiwan. Exponential growth obvious: 
2000 4000 8000 16000 32000

We'll see many millions need die idiots close bars lockdown.

In sane countries already 100% lockdown. heart hurts US. cousin wife live Arizona newborn twins somehow I'm safer South Africa right now. Hell yeah! (and commenters) got this! might also plug r/stopdrinking . It’s everyone, maybe it’ll help!!! Walmart gearing spread 3 black friday events year. I’ve signed Texas. scheduled first injection appointment, schedule already full week Thanksgiving, looks like they’ve kept everything motion besides actual initial injection. 

I lost insurance coverage last month, participating trial actually best way ensure get appropriate, timely medical treatment end getting infected Covid-19. become infected trial send home health care. We’re number one!! Well someone busy weekend... future gonna good. Welp, believe science data believe faux politician. choice! 'peachment december 2019? distinctly remember somewhere pre-christmas trip seeing TVs there. Keep calm! hoax! Jesus people. U ok, bro? 1900 cases New Zealand 100 days zero cases, cases managed isolation, praying don’t outbreak recent patron covid positive went pub 🤦‍♂️ one 600 Belgians tested positive within one days. infected, *actually tested* positive. Mind-boggling. search google it’s called disease USA.  Right now, softer version lockdown Slovakia end November can't travel district - paper permit test negative travel everywhere, self quarantine also can't go work take vacation. word ""Wave"" needs put bed regarding USA, fat Rocket-Pop colored jiggly bowl Jell-O. one initial slap 7 months ago 3-4 jiggle. 

&amp;#x200B;

We.. Jiggle.  can’t find english articles, wanted mention somewhere broken record Denmark last two days.
The day yesterday 760 new cases, yesterday 863 new cases. Took wrong turn maybe. Yup. There's people who've twice times say symptoms way severe. Remember China funny? - Norm MacDonald  Uhhh kind logic this? 
 12ish months virus live, singular instance mutation. instances reinfection (that dubious claims best little evidence). 
 
This wrong. wrong. Point blank. moving goalposts to, 'oh well increase death rate February I'm wrong' ridiculous nonsense. Facts important. Saying virus mutated factually incorrect exactly said. 
 
All comments also unnecessarily hostile shitty. never fearmongering.   thread needlessly aggressive. 
 
And wrong *again* say virus last mutated February. D614G mutation significant increase transmission. several mutations noted. realize makes big impact people, reasonable comparison. number US deployments warzones WWII fraction population. China locked propaganda machine firewall tight summer.

No way hell leaks getting millions dying season. AI big brother taking care that.    ~~ironic~~ tragic thing india die old enough risk group. actual tests part important medical protocols stop spread therefore knowing *who* infected important *how many*, data there. failure collect data there. Didn’t get 90,000s month two ago? work target country lot morons. Shut down, need protect .06% Masks. 

Distancing. 

Preventative measures like virtual learning. 

We technology drive things, we're Americans. Damnit. believe idea shouldnt discuss certain topics (politics) allowed radical crazies go unchecked.

Hence everyone crazy racist uncle...no one tells forcefully ""stfu dumbass""

We cant let dictate discource. They're minority, keep giving loudspeakers. Holy shit S&amp;P500 gonna go like 10 percent news Fuck em. going die point. stupid hot nurses at? I'm coming NY avoidable America. Damn Moderators call disinformation say Sweden tried herd immunity strategy. Make will. One things noticed people reacting Covid-19 people good health ( often take granted) seem far less concerned pandemic people experience poor health. sister got it. Apparently covid STD too. least state mask mandate.. Lookin YOU, Kim Reynolds. better show study nurses doctors full intensive care units. They'd happy dream experiencing. We’ve rounded bend turned corner. /s I'm sure would help, feels like lost cause since became political. Even white house made campaign admitting wrong made push masks, think supporters would probably blame deep state that. 2,000 COVID deaths people &lt;35 divided estimated 30-40million infections US. Yeah pretty damn close 0. I’m worried driving work everyday getting COVID probably already didn’t even know People wear masks really something else. hell expect get back normal everyone chip help? Mandatory masks ticket. contradiction amazing it? Voting would destroy unions them. long 100,000 new cases one day?

Wear damn mask. socially distant. Wash hands. Don’t go unless absolutely to. 

We part beat virus. misspelled incompetent libtards. I'm favor sending students back right now, is/never even semi-coherent plan safely, particularly teachers.

That said, hate crisis gotten many people make comments like yours, minimizing importance education. Quality education essential functioning society. Without it, voters incapable assessing evidence. friends family understand evaluate risk.  populace understand exponential growth is. 

I picked examples really important current crisis, many problems nation stem huge number uneducated people. 

It jobs. Sucks people can't go without medication either.  Except didn’t, theatre amplified pro-government propaganda told &lt;0.1% chance, even greater risk COVID poses people age 35, yes I’d go it. 206,000 deaths total, 18% expected.

So excess deaths figure around 31,000  “You got gotta wear around me. Don’t afraid!”

Someone meeting day. true. refusing wear mask many cases pack gun local hardware store refusing wear mask. state spend thousands dollars storm shelters refusing wear masks.  makes sense want protect one other. Great post 🤣 thought took 1-2 weeks show positive test? tests positive they’ve already long right? let’s revisit couple weeks see death rate changes. didn’t Texas Florida spiking summer. Also: EU classifying China safer travel basically places New Zealand. ""just open economy let live begin again""

"" saga needs end. ""

1 stone 2 birds really hope right :( reason cooperate.

If ""didn't know"" walk around whatever want, one touch you.

If ""knew"" infected someone else, hook documentation verboten walking around breaking rules, pay up. Mask mandate get influential celebrities sides make commercials. Instead cdc wasting 330 million dollars pro trump commercial running mask awareness commercials. sheriff straight said gonna enforce mask mandate all. That's excuse. control that. Chin up, like forever. partner's dad earlier month. prime demographic make alive -- 60, number prescribed medications pain things nature, pneumonia several times life. caught regular check-up. mom works home leaves walks park every grocery store, leaves even less since he's retired. Someone walked past (since wait right outside exam room doctor??) coughed something. caught super quickly, immediately quarantined himself, squeaked alive. Apparently put shitload antibiotics. kept calling horse-pills big haha. Tested negative, waiting rest symptoms pass. still glad made alive. Maybemaybemaybe Fine give finger. Jesus sub full idiots. Antibodies persist MONTHS world’s top researchers believe cell memory offer protection 1-2 YEARS. Yes, people gotten multiple times due weird one immune system issues. literally 1 million cases. you’re honestly going around living 1 million events buying Ferrari right paid future lottery winnings. new measures include:  facemasks indoor public places  ban selling alcohol 10pm (including supermarkets convenience stores)  assembly limit reduced maximum 10 people want anyone touching titers. uncle syndrome contracted virus. mid 50s handicapped, little symptoms virus. said, seems greatly accelerated dementia, knows sure... moms work teenagers struggling remote. least one ""it doesnt feel like school"" mentality. They're equipped yet age. Chopping leg higher death rate beer virus. It’s even close. Europe exactly region lol Yes!! leave anything stable van quarantine! Found another one, add one sacrificial bucket wrote many times before, every analysis GDP financial transactions shown:

The vast majority economic damage done shifting spending patterns, youth prohibited go large parties. everyone would wear mask keep social distance economy would humming. It’s contagious basic precautions taken. It’s literally wearing seat belt yet slightly less half voting population country wants make kind infringement rights. It’s laughably deranged self-defeating. want give away info, uninstall android phone hand.

Anyone get vaccinated they're scared tracked told this. Idiots. least, ones belonged unions. hope one bothered reply piece shit like relate much! still clean groceries honestly may never stop. feel good clean! Trump said would made great job would 100k-200k deaths. awful job. Cool chop give leg. die means fine right?  Fair point. agree, said, would ideal plan. reality though many business forced close without compensation, stay open without compensation.

I live Sweden, know lockdown, however March city ghost town. businesses forced close good enough customers. let's remember Sweden, along rest Scandinavia, socialist society. safety nets guaranteed benefits. lost job, increased unemployment compensation 2500 euros month. business owners Norway Denmark probably alright lockdowns. luxury southern Europe, various reasons, main one creating system can't done night. Iny surprised, feel like state overall taking seriously Live free die! /s Enlighten us. Might well get rid laws promise therapists would call anxiety new deadly contagious disease “cognitive distortion” I’m sorry therapist idiot. like profession, good ones bad ones, I’m sorry unprofessional unconcerned. I’m waiting funding rehab soon hopefully, meantime I’m using local charities support. Learnt hard way can’t alone!  ... they’ll start caring it’s family member refused care.

The start conversation ""Doctor, need speak Manager!"". already vaccine that’s 70-85% effective... masks. see that’s gotten us. Somehow there’s CO2 conspiracy theories masks. imagine theories actual vaccine? Let alone Biden vaccine? Us healthcare system one best pay lol. Yeah that's fine. Anything escape this.  brilliant response wish people would read it, especially United States Island great invention. Yep. I’m point hope hits family make ok. I’m pregnant, hubby high blood pressure mom rheumatoid arthritis. So, know... considered high risk. Fabulous. Excuse supporting interment Japanese Americans based race? Ooh im scared... Better buy stuff  Sweden used symbol.

People want party use masks supermarkets, even worse, avoid tiny inconveniences, bend numbers factor 5 more, seriously endangering dumb people propaganda, feign compassion old people third world, completely ignoring cause problems, including shift spending increased need health-endangering isolation high-risk groups. Let's hope that's majority, time. knowledge

Apparently among media. Considering poorly Europe right now, honestly think Democratic presidency would've handled crisis America *that* much better. Obviously they'd avoid obvious idiocracy Trump, think they'd still struggle manage population willing enforce strict measures needed truly control things. may different opinion big scary numbers 220000 deaths look big scary Thanks! swallowed pride checked rehab I’m getting plenty help thing getting annoying. want every day life return. son school home basically prisoner irritating virus.

Either legal mandate masks social distancing precautions open economy let live begin again. We're nothing half measures result virus stopping economy day day life shit.

This saga needs end. True, small retailers survive due Christmas sales 16 new cases today Australia. 
But fair, approx 12 would quarantined inbound international travellers. Sweden used symbol.

People want party use masks supermarkets, even worse, avoid tiny inconveniences, bend numbers factor 5 more, seriously endangering dumb people propaganda, feign compassion old people third world, completely ignoring cause problems, including shift spending increased need health-endangering isolation high-risk groups. Death rates lagging indicator usually 2 weeks That’s far 100K one day?!?!? Sheesh, hope they’re okay there. yall nincompoops never wanted close month, like hard stay inside go necessities.. like 8 months still getting worse. School district pres said ""even amid outbreaks, stay open""... wrong people.. 🤦‍♂️ think long second wave goes autumn winter instead third wave  get reasoning, see possibly wait long given happening country. I'll furious decide go route European way drugs advertised US intruiges terrifies me. K. And? Death rates aren’t rising. Trying climb mt rainier next summer Derived different tested on. shatter records day day winter. bodies stacking like cordwood. govt charge moment washed hands covid 19 pandemic.

In Michigan republican controlled supreme court struck governor's emergency covid rules everyday since see people wearing masks stores.

Winter coming along big holidays. Superspreader family events happening USA. sad country doomed start people charge. It’s working grandmother hospital right now. He's trying poison babies. saw breath climbing flight stairs wearing mask, salutes, still orange af. worry, I've reliably informed family members covid disappear November 3rd. ^/s Girls days don’t care, U? tell Singapore New Zealand. Try googling it. Turning corner, according Trump way Bell's bigger Covid. get feeling going REALLY long, sad difficult winter. Thanks!! There’s hope people. sadly, therefore hope country.  Airbnb host who’s house damages due party angers me, even mentioning pandemic Nah. I'm going imagine takes 20 doses day smoothy bullshit. Anyone claimed mask wearing medically impairs ability breath either lying willfully misinformed.

A recent study found even people severe COPD wear masks one favorite like wearing mask, HATE ventilator! death rate beginning though? Also hospitals start max dont beds. planning that? know future claim everything fine ignorant. president still day mocking people wearing masks. Says alot future. except 5 6 areas outbreak entire country cases per pop place europe large degree. still need get control though. Right France set record....

Why must America always try one everyone everything? statistical anomaly even symptoms.

Can believe guy?! Trying make Dear Leader look bad ""long haul Covid""! Good one. U A. *Covidbunga, dude! still allowing IHME projections? They've worst - nearly worst - projections since beginning. remembered thinking would take end year get mil deaths thought would huge tragedy considering measures many countries around world took badly economy fucked up. Yet October covid killed 1.1 MILLION people 2 months till end year. That's even taking consideration excess deaths data suppression many countries regarding that.  heartbreaking. went NYC... don’t want see anyone else endure similar nightmare. wish people would wise up... hospitals get breaking point, it’s bad time everyone. People talk lockdowns horrible, etc. fact NEEDED sometimes. thoughts healthcare providers Midwest... don’t stop coming won’t stop coming Remember hoaxers laughing sane people said go away Easter back April? 

How sad turned out. still audacity joke around get warned ""lmao two weeks right rofl"" end wrong again..they never fucking learn never will. protesting lockdowns lol Lol wait til thanksgiving  truck morgues again. ND *know* full obedient bitches? Joe able stop mask madness February.

So think able get everybody wear mask March April even December 2021? 

There lot Americans refuse wear mask. dude sitting White House going make wear one, matter is. I've said beginning

And you? care you’ve said? zero evidence can't. know people reddit saying caught virus twice now. trolls? know.

 enough known virus right say can't catch twice. like common cold flu, catch again. point wake notice lie. still remember people telling April vaccine around corner. bureaucracy holding back. wonder got idea rate, it’ll thing we’re keeping alive... “The big unknown often happening,” says. studies needed learn whether rare case something happening know more, Poland says possibility getting COVID-19 twice shouldn’t make anyone also happens kinds coronaviruses -- ones cause common colds. coronaviruses change slightly year circle globe, allows keep spreading causing run-of-the-mill kind also happens seasonal flu. reason people get vaccinated flu year year, flu vaccine change slightly year effort keep ever-evolving influenza virus.

Thats straight article.

Are fearmongering article linked literally says middle?? mean, undermine point, “he good reason lie this” never stopped Trump before.  honestly don’t know much federal government though, sending clear message top definitely important, we’ve seen European countries that’s guarantee complete success. Curious think. understand guy blaming central government, blaming governors, ignoring mayors, attacking people political party region good numbers?

Then soon actual responsibility 3 days cases rose immediately started yelling disaster ICU beds on. today blaming citizens usual like problem said would like impose 30-40 days hard lockdown regardless economical impact, even discussing central government mayors?

You see protests rome milan. see calabria sardinia.

Guess why. Bottom line, masks work extremely effectively preventing spread airborne virus. I'm civil liberties, believe me, freedom ends safety begins. viral pandemic objectively public health crisis need act like adults it, moody middle schoolers think they're edgy follow Ben Shapiro. Full stop. Sorry, covid brown country oil Coronas stay baby! Lol. anyone actual check accounts anymore? account 15 days old spewing anti-trump stuff. Go home stupid bot. Last time checked, Trump isn’t one charge preventing Covid spread. Ever heard local government? freedom? everyone responsible citizen stop blaming every problem president don’t like. Yup. Immune people act like can’t carriers. Zero consideration everyone else. u. Less emojis, education Don’t talk Biden getting turned debate! fear coronuuuuu!! Sad! Thats big reason get flu shot year. Getting flu covid time could deadly even healthy individuals. It’s best testing. Best world

People cant go without food “a months”. recovering alcoholic who, years hindsight clarity, see ridiculous dangerous harmful type tie-one-on drunk is, wholeheartedly accept metaphor. Oh much better listen democrat governors forced covid positive patients nursing homes. worked well everyone.  refrigerated trucks morgue overflow hospital Los Angeles around July, things starting look like going happen soon.

PikachuFace  Easter can't come fast enough 😢 someone southern hemisphere came flu season, actually mild year due social distancing. actual figures hand, total cases something like 20% usual annual figures.

But, given little care concern masks social distancing US, I'm sure guys similar results =/ Europe spiking one calls leaders. get pass? looked it, Newsom said would vaccine independently reviewed. think time might happen measures taken stop things Yeah, bad intelligent thought.

There's evidence post COVID ""immunity"" exists even last longer days weeks most. We're already seeing repeat cases. really never happened US. think never happen. build field hospitals. saline

Was amount saline given experimental arm well control arm? patients experimental arm require administration IVs? known issues saline remdesivir?

# problem “YOUR GONNA DIE” card plenty people know people who’ve mild cases. Wow, well really hope family fully recover problems. stay healthy think positively, really helps.   hope thinned heard stupid ones. Probably get lucky though. Lmao wasn’t yesterday’s record 77k? Big F mean, sort third What's wrong photo? Everybody wearing mask, seems social distancing going on. agree. said ""you wear mask problem health care workers need more"". chose lie. Calling anything else another lie. Idiot calls new science. confirmed cases actual cases. almost certainly actual cases spring summer surge. Testing levels abysmal spring, probably catching 1/10-1/25 actual cases testing. probably closer 1/3-1/5 now. We'd approximately quadruple spring numbers confirmed positives get anywhere close number actual cases.

The CFR lower now, due better therapeutics standard care, even hit number actual cases spring fewer people die. Unless hit capacity healthcare system, people die per 1000 cases spring. Sure usually drastically different populations. Western countries living western lifestyles pretty similar. little reason drug mainly tested brits different americans. There's plenty population variation amongst americans well. 


I agree poster suspect good way getting companies subsidise running US trials inject money US economy, rather purely scientific merit. western developed countries standards higher equal US tend accept data outside country provided good quality. Won’t stop people moving goalposts though yet ;( get here? Thought decided months ago? 🤔 could handed free vaginal steam clients. Oh want gift certificate $200 worth vaginal steam here’s 2 N95 masks wear come in. Totally legal. Hahahaha elected political representatives would listen abide recommendations infectious disease experts. Yup VIP medicine around long time, annoys brags recovering splendidly Americans never get medical treatment did. Yes, however appears maze think know IFR? March more, actually know lot virus can't hide behind ""it's normal virus spooky novel virus know nothing about"". Globally, IFR much lower, around 0.13% according WHO. 

And yes agree, amazing people can't math quickly virus spreads social interaction basic impossibility trying stop screaming people stay indoors. also can't math number jobs livelihoods would destroyed attempted reduce social interactions. think they're also unable conceptualise losing year normal life whole population, ruining life chances generation, plunging hundreds millions children workers back poverty might actually worse balance trying (unsuccesfully) reduce number deaths group people approaching age average death anyway. How's empathy? Melbourne 700 day instituted worlds toughest lockdown.

I beyond disappointed former friend. saddening, dad worked exact job sane factory. hospitals even need flu shot. refuse it, wear mask flu season.

These people see flip mask talk phone, whatever reason. phone another nurse grabs talks into.

It's crazy fucking crazy nurses are. are? Except comparing peak earlier wave early point later wave. peak, would sensible conclusion. However months cold weather get we'll spread peaks totals much higher, example state we're two thirds summer peak even holidays coming maskless state fair last week. would crazy say get worse peak much uncertainty ahead.  I'm actually curious think that. Yes rang? Good grief. stupid they?  motorcycle party South Dakota. I'm sure many North Dakotans went, state. US primary producer WWII decimated Europe metrics.

Oppsies! Tuesday, Missouri Department Health Senior Service’s coronavirus dashboard posted message total number patients hospitalized COVID-19 underreported since Oct. 17. note blamed “challenges entering data” portal used U.S. Department Health Human Services collecting daily hospitalizations around health department spokeswoman Lisa Cox said federal hospital reporting system, known TeleTracking, went down. “As result experienced underreporting – hospitalization numbers lower should’ve been,” Cox said Hospital Association Senior Vice President Mary Becker said HHS recently implemented changes; measures removed portal, others added renamed. reporting hospitals able report using new measures, others not, result, system crashed, change impacting hospitals across country,” Becker said email. “Some states collect data directly may yet introducing new measures processes. Missouri hospitals use TeleTracking control introduction changes template.” Went high school Minot, place rotting decade since flood. think point people pandemic changed life lot, others big difference.

For example, talking family member - wife nurses, said life identical since pandemic started. wife spent lot time work still now. hospital COVID cases never overcrowded, things remained normal work. me, I'm teacher who's teaching home online every day, life feels quite different. Believe me, us trying. Biden gets elected, coronavirus getting better takes office, due anything does, he'll get credit lo sarà dappertutto temo, meno che non inizino distribuire sti vaccini version proven same, researchers begin think amount virus exposed to(viral load) connected severity symptoms. basically using masks, keeping hand clean social distancing helping this. Thank goodness Trump said vaccine would ready couple weeks. 😂🤣🙄  Paper-strip immunofluorescent nitrocellulose-based antigen tests. quick, easy, cheap manufacture. I'm hitting nerve intent. However, legally, Constitution protects certain rights, finely parsed legal scholars SCOTUS define parts absolute, others absolute.

The Supreme court makes distinctions. new justice originalist, too, makes distinctions. tilt windmills defend position absolutist view right. tasked judging disagree.

I'm moving on. good evening. crazy *last night* president complaining plexiglass school closures literally saying going away. planet on? r/agedlikemilk Thanks! written! Chance catch covid 1:200 ""hell no. gonna happen"".

[Source can't get second wave never let first wave end We're far away now. thought 400k dead would guess real toll somewhere between. see number feel like we’re playing Cliffhangers Price Right. lose fall cliff. cliff number deaths skyrocketing again. NCRI numbers make sense, forget politics it.

The official count hard believe.

This months lack testing.

Keep mind lots parts Iran NYC-level bad much year. 

And 130K dead still takes half deaths per capita NYC. But... *is* vaginal steaming? getting wrinkles out? Pleating? I'm confused feel like gonna see phrase ""biggest one-day increase record"" whole lot winter. waiting reply pop LMAO think it’s per capita numbers easier understand trying grasp impacts. It’s kind scale. Conservative idealogy 🤗 It’s becoming clear court systems capable handling domestic crisis ....Yikes. \*cringes\* literally use comment similar post lmao already acknowledged things go way could have. clear, wish different outcome protests. time, feel though situation could gone horribly wrong.

that's one day comparison.

FYI - California 40 MILLION people..

40 times one million SD.

so ONE DAY \~40,000

&amp;#x200B;

this counting multiplication known factor.

WTF demographically narrow?

math. already see old people playing Bingo coronavirus vaccine commercial narrator tells says one possible side effects injection site pain, rectal bleeding, stroke How's idiotic revolting? Bet guy also think trump self made man know wear it... 

But majority want to, take they're watched, might time assume cant depend mask wearing fail proof measure. 

Ideally pandemic would if.... ""Fill extreme measures would work""... nothing works ideally, someone designs plans better drawn around social normative skeleton wasting time resources... 

For example... 8 month lockdown Argentina done nothing, keeps getting worse worse... whoever designed strategy paper office, within reality boundaries Argentinian society. 

With masks Germany Berlin same... whatever reasons, varied different, majority us want wear masks, unless put cop corner, us never wear street... compliance indoors another matter, that's accepted seems based logical premises based know virus told last months... 

Outside spread minimal, viral loads necessary practically impossible casual 2 second encounter etc etc

(The logic used corona contact tracing apps many ""masks time"" Advocates love... tracing app count 3 seconds crossing someone risk... ) Imagine live shows... Vivo negli Usa, qua è un rischio vero :) get it, what's going on? feel like mask requirements stronger ever currently, barely ever see anyone wearing them. What's causing problems? seems like everyone settling ""people irresponsible"" answer, find hard believe; irresponsible people whole time? like everyone started irresponsible really recently once. even cold yet, get what's causing this. North Dakota apparently moron, Frank. say hospitals use cash rules idiots. going affect good people, there's always collateral. hospital care COVID positive. policy weeks see people start take seriously. Thank much thorough answer! Wow, pretty severe, last long.. know guys managing. must strongest restrictions lasting longest amount time anywhere know of. Stay strong, hopefully light end tunnel somewhere soon.

EDIT: stories linked allowing crossing provinces etc, reading detail. Jesus Christ. inhumane, approach clearly working. great. Now, hopefully billionaire talking billionaire friends others help well. nice, probably charity write also, helps community. link source study published today IHME *Nature Look Spain. want tell deaths lagging behind month half? Please... Something like Well thank baby jesus virgin mary, things totally control Wisconsin. need Government restrictions there. pain ass 30 years. it. 

Local police: ok. Vaginal steam 👀 Jesus taken wheel. American here, spends lot time NRW. Well, year, normally.

I’m observation, Germans compressed ideas personal space. queue store, normally give people least half meter, maybe even 3/4th. experience Germany, people give half amount. I’ve observed husband Germans always close. ""Around 130,000 lives could saved country adopted “universal” mask-wearing."" words kiss, 130,000 people goodbye. Joe able stop mask madness February. Sadly estimated 500,000 dead January looking plausible. get strong John Wick vibes mandate.

""Hello, John. heard wife... I'm sorry. condolences. It's, uh, seemed fate, happenstance, bad f\*\*\*in' luck caused paths cross again. Let us resort baser instincts handle like civilized men move on."" be. Protesters masks outside bad transmission risk. None states protests saw spikes correlating protests. Hospitalizations deaths lagging behind. We've numerous times.  10 them? basically called liar. cannot make decision anyone else.

I suggest searching online patient forums Covid locating people taken drug. Anecdotal experiential information valuable. I’m sure people currently sharing information (is formal message forum? Reddit sub yet?). 

A quick Twitter search using #LongCovid yielded Sounds like Trump wrote headline like apprentice t. need work (with limitations do, example allowed alone kids) go school ?educator? kindergarden. like intern university. got think infected (in school). get lost contact tracing. live (not big region, 160k people) less control. 107 per 100k last 7days, going up. cases kindergarden gf works 4days, ah one mentioned quarantined bc flatmate positiv also somewhere else. bad. Winter pure horror nothing changes. many deaths many certain Americans ? 

A handful , thousands 9-11 thousands per day past months half million? asking question that's answered every single day countries varying rates mask use. one's implement widespread mask use continue lower case rates.

So yes. justified actually 60 minutes earlier month asked mandate said good idea unless got significantly worse. discussion mom today mentioned this. They’re going restaurant/pub tonight birthday party.

She said, “well, you’ve got live life.”

That all, responded with, “you live life cautiously” kill conversation move on. invited declined. Going pub “living life” me; feel alive walking park alone premise “you’ve got live life” built entirely manufactured conditioning constitutes “life” could probably make decent legal argument saying elected *to head law enforcement*, enforcing law(s), abdicating duties. 
 
But know hard-on people law enforcement doubt anyone would even make case. I'm getting filmed kids Insta Tiktok sports outside, giving biometric data god knows companies, accept Microsoft's health profiling work multiple times day, hell, text scanned profiled oblivion data mining companies, eager sell anyone.

I'm good, thanks. No, busy arguing political party said blame. self responsibility. shut already. provide rough estimate based region, number people, factors influence risk level. (Their bar ""extremely risky"" exactly think be, may want compare risk level things already do, like grocery shopping, get better idea risky something is. look percentage risk small print bottom, big colourful letters.) I’m saying 12 situation, mind would jump conclusion. would care flu 99.9%+ survival rate cases get tested know even lmfao Deleted comment. know what, historic peace deals, new wars, Platinum Plan, pre-covid economy come back second term. Im good satisfied. dude amazing I'm in. 

🍊 man big guy.

I still dislike people provide sources, nothing candidate support. people assholes they're sides. Yeah... 6 months ago discussing possible future outcomes know that. 

If long-term immunity COVID19 things gonna bad long time. accurate saliva test? people refuse wear mask reason shutting throw tantrum. people worst.  sure already decreasing we've learned treat better. thing is, death rate. also lung heart complications doubt comfort, Utah, I'd bet happening everywhere.

I live southeast US I've heard parents happening here.   even sure one sniffles classroom. Stay there, want yo stanky ass soo unfortunate soo risky. recently got job nurse rehab center start November I'm terrified. live mom got hospital ventilator 5 days reasons unrelated Covid, gets it, high probability dying it.
People think ones around sad. haven’t dined anywhere since March, even order takeout. Saved ton money way bored food. extra cautious guess. Here's thing strategy mention. gets sick survives symptoms. problem able get treatment. Hospitals become overwhelmed...we'll kill shit ton health care workers...and bodies stack like cordwood. people could saved treatment simply able get we'll quickly overwhelm system. They're already experiencing shortages standard medications. start killing millions Americans civil unrest that's going come kill million more.

I find purely insane members government think millions people going quietly die homes. That's happen...it chaos. already starting. 

This going bad winter. People need make plans stay home take care families prepare basics they'll need survive basic meds hand...because think come January much hospital capacity (not Covid...but everything). Yeah, I'm well aware. live Salt Lake City. that's actually small percentage different Christians Bro, serious? Democrats made step step pandemic guide, created pandemic response team. Republicans disbanded team threw playbook trash. So, gtfo this, dems nonsense. created plan team deal it.

What Republicans it? trumps Healthcare plan he's said he's roll since last fucking election? Jesus christ man... It’s mostly Trumpies. Dumbness made thing. outbreak, especially elderly care homes, March May bad. Really bad. ICU cases deaths started dropping (from high levels) already mid April. Since June, things pretty good. July August, cases, ICU cases deaths lower Europe negative excess mortality since. 

The big difference approach focus sustainable measures people accept long time, rather locking down, opening up, locking again. 

The Norwegian approach similar Swedish one difference Norway soft lockdown beginning. then, Sweden already hit pretty hard. speculation winter holiday week 9 Stockholm, like 100 000 Swedish people went Italian Austrian alps, brought virus back home. 

Personally, think failed weakest elderly beginning. shit show, everyone agrees with. Since then, think Swedish health agency managed things pretty well. Persistently arguing work home, keep socially distancing, wash hands, isolate 70+, don’t travel etc.

In surveys conducted regularly, strong support Swedes government’s approach. 

Reading reports Sweden US / international media really...interesting. It’s obvious Sweden used domestic agendas extremes spectrum:
“Look Sweden badly trying herd immunity (which never btw) - let’s lock everything avoid that!” vs. “Look Sweden basically nothing fine. Let’s that”. 

Both statements wrong. really want left alone. :-)

Number cases rising like everywhere. (yet) level instance South Dakota, Czech Republic, France Spain.

To compare, cases last 14 days:
* South Dakota - 1132
* Sweden - 113
* Norway - 35
* Czech Republic - 1142
* France - 504
* Spain - 381

But rise cases Sweden worrying indeed. don’t think yet. Far it. 

Stay safe!

Edit: reasonably balanced reporting English Sweden, think “The Local” place look. target group expats people don’t speak Swedish, living Sweden. used 7 day average figure ours. long restrictions place doesn’t seem super likely spike would surprise us blue. far true, realize novel situation change dime. 

For family feel comfortable spending time families following level risk mitigation us. 

I think forced figure risk little guidance leadership, abstinent, risk evaluation info important share. work security retail store, city mask mandate months still difficult keep everyone wearing one, wearing properly. Also worth noting McConnell admitted want put anything vote election. teacher Houston, assure several suspected/confirmed cases kept quiet schools many parents encouraging keep schools open. “Children prioritized, they’re missing positive things going school,” Dr. Jenkins said. “I don’t understand we’re community getting together deciding schools need priority making safe can.”

This get lost. Why, sudden, want prioritize education? Anyone education knows urban settings severely underserved, overpopulated less access medical care. Education isn’t prioritized outside pandemic. It’s glorified daycare. 

What don’t understand, doctor, aren’t prioritizing making education accessible everyone equally outside pandemic first place. suburbs problem opening around me. None all. Trumpies gotta dumb.  Even people know taking appropriate precautions beginning pandemic starting fall now. stamina resolve all, sad. I've mentally assembling apocalypse team friends family choosing ones still reacting appropriately me, would told take selfish ass right door. Manager went beyond make happy instead thought. don’t give shit COVID, want make money. 90% customer base quite elderly, so, we’ll see works long term :/ one seeing response cause ass downvoted.

You saw it. 

Exactly Yes, was. /r/coronavirus can't stand that, upvoted (repeatedly) story leading like 300,000 cases something. Sunken costs, need defend article, matter what. Name countries “moved on” see countries seeing resurgence cases... still covered neighboring countries noticed spike radiation levels mean mortality rate 3x lower then? Trump, spraying load sentence. threw mouth some. asked feels? us shorter expiration dates due illness age often fearful virus already faced mortality. us limited good time left want spend inside isolated. may accepted mortality may need respect that.

Many people dying every day non covid fearful care us. live Tri cities, WA. It’s same. many wearing masks wearing improperly- noses. I'm grouping together. Unless suggesting pro-maskers would lie contact tracers they're afraid punishment? so, people would selfish anti-science crowd.

In case, contact tracers enforcement people. doubt contact tracers going report illegal gatherings enforcement side, considering enforcement side (in CO anyway) concentrating businesses violating orders individual groups.

I think order net negative. side losing control narrative pride leaving cult. sad conservatism hijacked lunatic. man even fiscally responsible! No, any.

I numbers climbing despite mandatory masks, makes believe ultimate allmighty silver bullet. Otherwise numbers would climb like that. supposed know lol. guess good mine. definitely cause concern well, could utilized cloth masks / home-made face covers. Anything better nothing

Honestly even wanted medical mask then, find it. worst part hand sanitizer NOWHERE found. stores, online, nowhere (along toilet paper, consumer stupidity lol). course shelves stocked, pretty unnerving seeing numbers skyrocket able get hands bottle sanitizer. Literally Engineer here. Yes do. long 100,000 new cases one day?

If late March/early April lockdown measures put I'd say could easily hit 100k day Thanksgiving. roommate doesn’t care anymore going bars Chicago tonight work shutdown high cases. I’m even mad anymore, I’m depressed now. Asian cultures think group Western countries individuality championed. huge advantage getting people comply protocols. Pretty sure ""news"" US, would record LOW cases. Kinda pointless mention single states IMO w/e doesnt bother pretty desensitized Take someone mask police gym grocery store: people aren’t wearing masks properly all, won’t. people opt complacency it’s never going go away. Cancel order. That’s Hard say, worst regions entire testing identified 3.6% so... people including worried go tests regions means waiting 4 hours line multiple minutes closed rooms others waiting results. that's wear way. told wear one. am. Incorrectly course complying need make decisions guard family holidays right now. it! mean, old people likely die acting like kids refusing wear masks kind example gives young? Yeah, no. Pretending threat ""adapting"" didn’t realize still alive! I'm aware environmental concern; think major factor people ended doing. [The Population published 1968 predictions mass famines '70s come pass 1975, think say book led anybody kids (say) 1977.

Look, I'm 40s too. many adults parents' age deliberately decided kids -- those, many made decision *that* reason? (Nobody parents' home towns would given crap egghead hippie worries overpopulation.)

In [Census Bureau mentioned, major negative percentage change births '70s looks like '72 '73 (I wish they'd labeled axes better), would correspond either last days US involvement Vietnam War oil crisis / recession. per-capita rates births late '80s climb much -- going 14 15 per 1,000 maybe 17 per 1,000 1989 -- larger population late '80s per-capita based on. data fit story. Pretty sure said back March n95 shortage people really needed didn’t it. IOW: Basic health screening available everyone US... *for price*. exactly news. shows careless leaders are. vaccine ends total bust? lot different, worthwhile data plots, I'm pretty sure we've inflection points moving average. Feel free link graph think says otherwise. It’s undoubtably concern many. friends sister lives DC leaving city week election. People DC scared. reality injecting bleach taken seriously? something really wrong think good idea... yeah I've heard people literally injected bleach, concur, must something really wrong them...

Pursuing policies encourage citizens work one another mundane regulations (something isnt directly harming someone else) tears communities apart. assessment. say listen scientists, unfortunately live world longer credible sources. political infected every major institution culture facets used manipulate. Also, consult medical professionals, solution take account issues hand. Keep mind, I've never said virus isnt real. Exaggerated, yes, fake. anecdotal I've spoken nurses said they're marking everything covid. must order keep furloughed due lack elective procedures person visits. several instances extremely odd cases listed Corona deaths. Regardless, agree noone right force wear mask (force=deprived life,liberty,pursuit happiness). could agree here, we'd fine. right. go far. Unfortunately orange clusterfuck currently charge managed fuck things efficiently way going get back sort normalcy combined, 3 prong approach:  
1) Pro-Active Testing, Tracing, Isolation National Level (National Guard's Logistics apparatus would effective)  
2) Significant Economic Stimulus essentially pay non-essential small businesses stay closed order a) avoid economic pandemonium b) reduce likelihood community spread  
3) Federal requirements, enforced local level, public safety practices. i.e., Small Crowds, Masks, Social Distancing, active tracking community pods. (Pods would allowed get together must break identified pods) 


By above, we'd back normalcy within 6-9 months. means masks, risk killing grandmother next family gathering, ability go bar please without risking death, etc. Well, sure seems like next/last stop elderly Yes. losing lives alarming rate. We’ve already ruined environment hard say worse.

Either care, lose 4-5% earth’s population 1-2 years devastating impact too. last night whataburger bunch teens inside eating, place packed ive seen something while, mostly group. 1 wearing mask joked whatever, wasnt inside didnt hear. went got pick trucks trump flags billowing behind them, joking.

Oh one dont tread flag It’s constitutional right make fellow citizens sick die. joking? Source? really understand crap like this. give 3km/h margin error, 60 speed limit 63. people claim want another 3km margin dunno, instrument error ... know it, speed limit 60 70. hell, case 55mph becomes 65mph (so 100km/h, that's freeway speeds). that's everyone drives at. hard needing responsible making mistakes, things going wrong? People impatient attitudes speed limits (including legislators) ridiculous. There's shame self improvement. really covid outbreak till lucky way

also wrong.

Keep denying reality flat earther tin foil hat weirdo. Closing gyms restaurants young healthy people reside violation freedoms people. People lose money population stupid accept corona scare served media. Nope. Calling pathetic ignorant name calling makes sense. can't admit clue talking about. East Asia great. like people know deal it, people chose to. can't imagine going restaurant. find idea insane. irritates hell US government subsidizing bars restaurants workers close/stay home.  town, mask social distancing compliant...I still see restaurants way full numbers going up. literally understand people all. me, staying home...not gathering...and eating out...is big deal keep people front line workers safe. I'll long necessary. can't imagine taking every step necessary protect people. Correlation causation

What grounds make hypothesis evidence. actual scientific evidence?   mean way really know sure. general trajectory seems places open staying up. never really bottomed 

My point completely goalpost near bottoming out, missing meaningful oscillation. shows resolve willingness make tough choices. nation rewarded effort road eliminate worse options stabilizing society. can't fight can't see. level testing let government ""see"" they're against. Excellent decision. Keep good work... Breathe deep, lick doorknobs... It’s always false choice fallacy think attempt control coronavirus comes expense economy.

- Reddit show reputation poster go profile, can't always see immediately whether post expert (you, apparently), someone spamming content, random person qualifications. question really matter posts, generally bother looking.
- Yeah, can't deny skeptical...*ness?*. multifaceted problem, likely mixture politician loudest, fact find study disprove study, lack understanding consensus works, people's inherent resistance dissenting data. say, set ways opinions, *really* hard change them. Sometimes, even trying purpose.
- Agree again. I'm rural part Texas, almost nobody wears masks unless they're business requires them. see people putting they're crowded indoor places, see people making effort maintain distance. emergency panic subsided, matter gradual change... again, people resist. hard to. 
 - basically *nobody* disagrees prevention containment good things, we've got going us. think hardest part demographics. Younger people far likely spread disease, commonly hang large crowds; low percentage people 50 actually *die* it. people seem see whole spectrum suffering exists perfect health hospitalization death.
 - ... almost understandable, given see news. see extremes -- death, ventilators ICUs -- see ""mild"" cases. ""mild"" cases -- merely defined *don't* require hospitalization -- pretty bad too. There's whole world hurt require hospitalization, that's people seeing, need see.

... honest, staying six feet away humans... good idea, even without virus. One reason ""bubble"" need feel comfortable. frankly care you.


And this, folks, exactly Americans shit storm. toxic combination selfishness, self-centeredness, patriotic nationalism stupidity. impact mutations significant absolutely mutated.

If impact mutations arent significant, matter? mutation effect virus another slight variation something concerned with, even pushed thought. difference H1N1(swine flu) say H5N1(bird flu). literally 0 sum difference. Literally saying far, however, **no mutations observed change virus’s replication, transmission, disease immune mutation **may** change behaviour virus, **though way impossible predict.**

When last statement says SARS-CoV-2 mutates slowly. this, likely new treatments continue effective behaviour virus dramatically change coming months. However, important work toward viral containment ending pandemic, longer virus continues circulate, greater chances new mutation emerging.

Okay, **technically** yes, virus ""*mutated*"". since mutation absolutely nothing change virus (replication, transmission evasion), like growing mole back. **could** dangerous, right now, small brown blot.

Now, stop fearmongering. ironic thing india die old enough risk group. -Joe Blow Parrot Fuck yeah shoot every month even safe.  George W piece shit, I've seen lot weird nostalgia shameful politician recently really get it.

So gotta tank it. sucks there's work around. since beginning. There's reason surprised wealthy first line many cases China acceptable you?

If say 1m someone still say 1m 1.3 billion population?

How build world class convention center giant escalators 32 weeks took Washington metro crew 24 weeks repair two tiny Gestapo like tracing system helped guys ?
Was fun whole summer fill papers contact info stasi ? crappy cus started flake. meet brunch? i'll try... also hard get groceries late. respect anti-CCP sentiment, really, case, they've actually solved covid crisis land. virus spreading rampantly (like countries) millions people died everyone's keeping secret somehow.

Contrary many might think, China completely closed box, every person physically China adores gov't. talk anyone China (whether local Chinese expat, etc.) confirm everyone's moved COVID way months.

Same plenty Asian countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, etc. I'm Ohio well, despite initial backlash mostly rural areas, least southwest region I've seen compliance mask wearing social distancing public spaces. However, many well educated people know, including several professors outraged safety college classes, going bars getting together friends several weeks now, posting Facebook. creates weird cognitive dissonance. I'm American I'm referring American domestic politics. I'm merely pointing U.S CDC's U.S government's history responding kinds outbreak always poor regardless who's charge. Many people thread expect coordinated response different administration hyping CDC. one point several cities locked down. 40 million multiple cities. Check facts. Wuhan. Unless masks mandated, continued. Ignorance care whether president orange white. Who’s going enforce mandate? police? almost would another flu. serious medical condition condemns years poverty.

Ask know. Lol imagine incapable distancing someone benefit. That’s like hugging someone stab heart. Sure feel better, what’s end result? remember called pretty horrible things subreddit saying would eventually hit point nearly 9/11 death tolls daily. did. hit number, sudden things calmed people telling we'd never get high started acting like thousand people dying day problem either used nearly 3k day. 

I accept lot people give shit huge amount Americans die, long them. 2020 longest decade life. 99% likely mild cases. remember late February, taking kids swimming classes getting pool little kids would sneeze right face. remember thinking ""this seems like really, really bad idea coronavirus gets here."" probably already idea. got this! politicized Trump ""down-plays it"" instead believing got betrayed lied president believe completely fabricated. raining snowing suggest windows stay open?

USA: challenging fool? ROFL it’a people low risk dying infected now, opposed earlier year saw deaths fragile elderly. ”silent transmission” deaths happened registered tests, wide spread testing. 

the difference IFR around 0.01% first group 5% latter reason case rate isn’t following death rate.

Why think Sweden counts deaths differently suspiciously? anything reported deaths match excess deaths better mot countries. work COV19 testing clinic. point lack government oversight makes wonder...what purpose this? weekly meeting. many people died week? 7000? More? Mostly seniors, younger...

Is possible government working way say...not pay social security thousands died? wipe away poor burden system underlying conditions? weed minorities? 

To me, begins look like social cleansing. miserably drawn face this, drags on, see alternative. im em Ctrl-alt-delete Something tells even Biden elected, people still gonna stay ignorant. people didnt want wear masks before, would start wearing now? Canada.

It's overwhelming healthcare system. means basically stretching pandemic period longer timespan, exchange paralyze system, would've led deaths damage. understand daily cases reported. really want know country doing, report amount positive tests.

For example, Netherlands 10000 positive tests yesterday. truly horrible statistic. also test more.

However, people get tested here, around 15% test positive. means yesterday actually 60 70k tests.

Back July positive test ratio 0.6%.

Is known, US, number risen last week's/months? gives extra insight debunks claims state "" well reason numbers test more"". Trump said something like 60minutes interview.

Pretty sure fucked either way though like us. good thing covid cases/deaths registered, chance Biden elected.  Yup! Oklahoma hit record high new cases yesterday 1600. Meanwhile 82 ICU beds available according weekly epidemiology report, 82. 82 13 entire OKC metro area. OKC bad car accident away zero ICU capability. color coded map state puts single county colored red... Well case count popular anti mask crowd see exclusively US certainly isnt proof believing science regards covid, discussing first place dont know brought TCM.

And literally use fucking comment you. think small minority China practising TCM measure extent population ""believes science""? think twice u make another snarky comment. genuinely worth wasting time on. lots free time. 

This shouldnt way cope reality. Smart people believing science governing goes hand hand stop spread. results clearly show US government certain number people pretty fucking stupid.

And youre blaming government solely thats pretty dumb too. France: speed


USA: challenging me? Except won’t cases.  Norwegian authorities said already April infections going lockdown put place, definitely true Sweden. Yes leaders letting youdown . STay safe friend Right?!

Trump's America really sucks.  do, least anecdotally, around *were* interested. feel large chunk weary. lands doubt. taking big strain mental health, feel people thinking hoax, sometimes easier pretend happening, everyone's craving old normality. Connecticut, looks 2X testing (total tests), 3X less population. I’m comparing many people wedding - I’m saying infection numbers start going down, things gradually open up. Genuine question - what’s situation like India? Exactly. Every one comments downvoted, even 'Liar' comment. 

As lockdown, severe example Spain outbreak never got big, non-essential services, schools kindergartens shut in-person, became illegal go 'hytte' (vacation/weekend home many Norwegians have) place main home. would assume Sweden harsh restrictions, therefore less people stayed home virus spread community. Stay strong, hopefully light end tunnel somewhere soon.

I'm hoping stories linked allowing crossing provinces etc, reading detail. Jesus Christ. inhumane, approach clearly working.

Yup, sadly approach seems locking infinitely hope best. include [the Solange man say goodbye girl ([she wrote moving caused outrage social media. several cases like ones linked (not get coverage).

So many outraging thinks happened hard keep them. Also man [was killed dissapeared police suspicious well past January February register 2019 brain. Hard fathom anything pre-shutdown occurred year. Yeah it’s psychotic It’s object isn’t it? Don’t think poetic shutdown childhood. That's really case, unless Europe ""failed states"", too. either complete fool actual billionaire order believe today's U.S. billionaires unfairly siphoning money away middle working class... I'm guessing billionaire. something happened past could used predict this! Perhaps large flu outbreak sorts! One three distinctive waves outbreaks! Oh!!! 
Oh, only. 
P.S. Sarcasm 2020 half morons well. didnt specify direction... like 6 people, chill out.

Jk meet Pence insisted. He's strict friday prayer. 

He might trying exorcise Fauci like likes pray gay away. 'actually sick' give someone be. people (including mass medias, really help here) missed concept exponential curve first time, song again. slow beginning then.. KABOOM. 


So extremely minor become extremely major weeks. I'm even talking lag testing incubation.

&amp;#x200B;

10 days ago france, everybody like ""uuuh that's fine - second wave blabla"". Well no, enough infected people skyrockets can't anything. way contain anticipate strong policies right start. Ofc one ""economy can't take it"". Yeah, enjoy full lockdown 10 times economic side effects, morrons. keep laugh/sighing see phrase. “Going/gone around bend” moms euphemism someone lost mental capacities (in “lost marbles” sense.) People still won’t believe he’ll job, losing ability try steer things right way Simply avoid ridicule anyone implementing anti-mask, anti-vaccine, anti-nicotine gum, anti-climate change, anti-recycling, extremist nonsense.

Idiots like nothing add conversation subject. False. ended Easter. President said so. Belgium, Netherlands, UK, Czechia, and...  lockdown 2 weeks, meet holiday without meeting anyone wasnt locked 2 weeks. 


thats we'll chrismas, though, we'll probably actual enforced lockdown then... \*knocks wood\* Wow it’s disappearing! /s time holidays! revolting? I'm surprised. ""possibly sacrifice bit privacy get this"" camp, understand that's everyone.

The app claimed data private opted share tracer claimed allow erase data time. verify claims, took good faith.

Again, totally understand people different boundaries. There's still plenty time ""soon"" context 15 billion year old universe. Everything currently uneasy holding pattern.  trump wins election atlas pushed fore barrington declaration also come fore.  biden wins atlas fouchi birx front center.  know can’t get rid right now.  would gone.  Trump can’t take dissent. orange one 13 days ago: ""But it’s going disappear. disappearing"" I'm moving ND tomorrow. I've before, town I'm moving 'ok' mask adoption rate months ago visited. shops wore them, 50% customers. Thankfully know people moving there.

I give flying fuck anyone thinks mask silly, I'm gonna wear it. fair, takes handful cases overwhelm North Dakota health care system. God. Wow always worry happen black husband white hear horror stories frequently. Wow people! Fucking Christ, candy? stay locked away forever. that's go full lockdown, every subsequent diminishing returns/compliance. Needed long-term policies transparency. Free PPE risk groups, mask policies, many policies enforced without infringing civil liberties livelihoods. figured out! soon deadman/woman made monkey’s paw wish life longer! makes complete sense. signs there. need call known shady antique dealers creepy owners. Someone knows something willing put foreign kids cages pretty easily extends giving crap hundreds thousands deaths people. It’s much karma correlation. wasn’t Covid would air water pollution lack healthcare. It’s related. actual pro life would mean accepting refugees wearing god damn mask protect people. Well realize people get immune, let us go get cant spread you....or prevent us getting continue risk spreading it.....maybe think much winning I'm beginning think matter individuals air ways shaped level producing forceful bio aerosols etc. different seems people naturally ""better"" spewing respiratory droplets aerosols. Plus combine someone naturally allows viral replication system etc.  part god's plan old you? Homes handing candy - candy could point infection


Kids ringing doorbells - doorbell could point infection

Even small hometown, free drive thru testing set-up similar wait times results, etc.  Well, username checks least. saying sounds like think Sweden Heard immunity strategy?

They're letting everyone want. would call strategy? “We’re rounding corner”

Lol ya cuz we’ve going circle  Great thing sacrificed much flatten curve. Dickson bad. live county outside town limits. methy here. asshat neighbor provides meth show need lmao.

I can't think last time Hickman county. went Waverly Walmart long ago though. friend property river there.

Edit: Hold up, username rings bell. think we've chatted Dickson before. really dont get one doesnt take bars n restaurant seriously. support get infected.

And yes stricter rules. Obviously protests spread cases. Denying denying reality viruses work yeah mocking bit.

But much realistic reason didnt see spike lot people already it. virus circulating least 4 months possibly even longer prior March. 80+% people zero symptoms. pretty safe assume us form immunity it.

Also contact tracers allowed ask attended protest.

I post sources statements interested.

You're lazy. Haha yeah rewatched pandemic movies back things started taking &amp; finished Pandemic Netflix Meaning AZ gets money? Sounds right. US wins starting 3rd wave instead second like every country thousandth time, think it’s safe say likely virus widespread testing could handle last spring. It’s difficult gauge relative severity infections many infections go undetected. combination infections detected + fact better treatments make infections appear less severe, even aren’t. said it’s possible dominant strain circulating less severe. likely won’t really know certain several years complete data set available. Yeah, people focus absolute numbers much. Growth accelerated slightly last 14 days. Previously exponential curve since 2020-07-10 steady incline.

""Who built hospitals Donald, who? making fake sky fairy mad important real threats society. rural America then....here wnc there's many million reasons like one friend wore everything facility (nursing home, etc) still caught wear seeing useless despite reasoning like them. There's many education system failed can't reason with.... Christmas family meet ups Christmas day, Boxing day days surrounding =

Deaths

We often meet lease 20 25 family members days around Christmas. folks probably same. 4 day meet family different houses could easily reach, say 500 people. meetings indoors peoples lounges / dining rooms. 

This nightmare trying contain virus could undo months isolation.  there's husband mad want go Thanksgiving get together later next month go restaurant lunch today... Nope. closed northern border. many diseased India currently peak average 60,000 days per day test positivity rate varying 5-9% per day. million tests conducted cities peak states reached peak recently India's trend. One thing tests rapid anti-body ones higher false positivity rate RT-PCR. one's taking pandemic seriously India shutdown bureaucratic mess millions people walk, hitchhike rent motorcycle reach home towns could thousands miles away workplace. much reddit loves idea lockdown, countries like India cannot afford nationwide lockdown like Italy France without crippling economy affecting poor population. pandemic double edged sword. Mandating? Sorry, I'm married, I'm allowed date. men thing anyways. guy puts firecrackers around body self punishment teacher? saw one hardware store's website: $1500 single heat recovery ventilator. drill two 6"" holes external wall. even know provides enough air changes useful. money full lockdown. People mad. Even mad due situation. Talking friend UK, seems like they've given up, even they'd lost family coronavirus. seems like Asian countries (plus Australia New Zealand) governments still vigilant.   Remmeber outbreak hit US government ZERO contact tracing? 

Fucking morons. No, believing said lies beneficial. proven, verifiable fact people dying covid still counted covid deaths. information found left controlled media sources. Credentials mean nothing, accredited lie.  Honestly places without mask mandates place get send overflow patients counties mask mandates especially states. fucking ridiculous northern Idaho absolutely nothing yet shipping disease-ridden morons Portland Seattle actually putting damn work in. I'm sure we're going set records. good ones. wish could. It’s insane. Apparently it’s county-level mandated. God bless good doctor.

And compassion leader country exhibit deaths 224,000 Americans counting?

""It is."" Primary Hey man 27 pregnant (at time autoimmune disease) girlfriend guys pull through. Drink vitamin c zinc packets Emergence C. Get Mucinex mucus lungs. Warm shit! Even water room temp! cold shit create mucus lungs make worse. Sleep, sleep, sleep! also taking ginger tea mom creates, also take tylenol help fever. got days rest sleep. Good luck op! dog terrified? Took temperature rude way? People need 1-3 fresh masks per day. problem now. People reusing masks weeks infecting themselves. Every time take may infected, going put it? going sterilize it? Even cotton masks need high temp wash kill virus.

I suspect majority people using masks incorrectly. probably - enough masks. 2020 calendar:

* January
* February
* March
* March
* March
* March
* March
* March
* March
* March
* March... would take vaccine promptly throw massive party result, 100%  what, nearly 8 billion people? Ya, know mutating much, amount time vaccine wildly available, idiots commingling idiots refuse take it, well could. least according report read experts subject. like it, take them. yes, virus known year, 17 want throw previous serious incarnation, seem mutate much one aware ~100 years. Nevermind lots Coronaviri. 

And yes idiot claimed responsibility US government buying 100 million vaccines. 

From AHA yesterday, thinks see approval early next year: 
 
""However, vaccine approved really step one tremendous undertaking distribute vaccine get people vaccinated.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, week said, ""It would terrible shame — think — safe effective vaccine we're able widely distribute need it."" AND, heading normal flu season thanks comrade explanation! lie. Please vote yet family still says it’s real.  forget mention EMAILS! biden virus. want lifetime lockdowns, forced vaccination makes sick life, well getting microchipped genetic experimentation - biden man. proof this? Everything “just trust media” would worked six months ago, now? would sooo much harder pull off. see Fauci's pleading president produced? Nothing, except disdain name calling. Appealing community would greater effect. Unfortunately, huge swaths rural communities riddled white nationalists MAGAs (I know, repetitive description) give shit what's best country whole. Maybe. point mind isn’t made up🤷‍♂️ Oh, bet mf's gonna start believing science need ventilators anti-viral meds! probably fetal stem cells, too. ethical medical treatment *my* medical treatment!  No, literally can't. manage national resources failed, no, can't tell whole country wear masks. presumably that’s due reduction symptoms

There room “presumably” science! 

A patient may discharged medically cleared based certain set criteria. example, patient induced coma, extubated (if intubated first place), O2 sat rates may within acceptable range, etc. 

In reality hospital may need bed.

But patient actually **feel**? feel like crap, incredibly weak, barely walk, feed, clothe bath themselves, live alone, etc. need home healthcare, help family, friends, community, etc. That’s meant wrote, “does reduce symptoms”.  guys going unbreakable, mega record winter? Although must say I’m impressed country’s ability keep pace summer. think India trying catch exploiting overpopulation tactic, good luck “We’re rounding corner.”

Only, around corner Coronavirus incarnate, baseball bat, winding up… forgot /s Thank help, that’s reason still go reddit understanding people seem imagine jaywalking politicized 7 months. national mask mandate nothing list, right underneath ""releasing taxes"" ""Here's great Healthcare plan""  think whole point lockdowns, social distancing, etc people going die soon anyways.

It's people makes difference receive care hospital determine they're going make it.

If let virus rip, hospitals eventually get overwhelmed, can't give everyone care need. result, death rate among younger, healthier people starts increasing. people eighties anymore. people 60's 70's, even younger. People preexisting conditions otherwise healthy. even young people randomly get really sick apparent reason.

On top that, hospitals suspend work deal influx covid patients. People cancer might receive chemo time lose years life.

I can't believe still needs explained joke post five people got hit asteroids last six months? stats bullshit, much likely get Covid twice getting hit asteroid I’m even going run numbers. We’re country that’s taking step back. Everyone else slowly recovering. that’s... big fucking problem. you’ll probably safe others likely bring back them. stay campus thanksgiving? (if nothing else avoid extra trips scrambling) worry, Trump said we'll vaccine end year we're going learn live then. hahahaa nostradouglas funny stuff Imagine India testing like America Europe. penalty though? I'm fear mongering. I'm taking seriously. say could die it? No, not. likely die it. breathing problems rest life.

All know friend nurse, caught back April still respiratory issues day. 31.

I know what's ass, I'm done arguing you. Continue stupid selfish. life mine. one downside mask gets sweaty. I’m breathing hard it’s like auctioned face. depends mask. Point is, that, people use go normal lives. literally hinder you, all. Disney demanding California let Disneyland re-open.

Get now? I'm Western Australia, currently cafe coffee. Planning going gym later cinema (to watch Akira 4K). local transmission months.

Sure tough living spot took covid seriously. Flex flex. is, March 236th. Multi-wave surfing bruh. don’t. Look Americans, it’s far away don’t care (like wars, like hunger, like contaminated water). hits middle-class, white communities problem. Eventually... does. Good luck, hope yall weather storm without much concern! win votes Joe? Yeah, know moment new provider like, ohhhhh gonna work out? felt way like two minutes in. much one ""Have tried... *not* unhappy?"" therapists. dismissiveness sealed deal. state city, covid cases actually gone even deaths, also 5% positivity rate says enough tests guess India contained virus hope so, may get vaccine soon soon Reeeally turning corner Donnie wouldn’t say? ...lifeless eyes, black eyes, like doll’s eyes. comes ya, doesn’t seem livin’ bites ya, black eyes roll white, – aww, hear terrible high-pitch screamin’, ocean turns red, spite poundin’ hollerin’, come rip ya pieces.

A Trudeau ønce bit sister...No realli! Since March, kept log every place husband we've contact with. thought might come handy.

Of course, we've hardly gone makes easy. friends know racist? coming out? Oh god, fucking tankies. hate tankies. get shades leftists mild liberals unreconstructed Stalinists defending CCP times maddening. like brother who's lefty defend ANYONE US government mad at, even Putin!

I think also depends power, often power complain whatever power doing. example Sweden fascists favor stronger measures start US opposite.

I think there's also difference border controls internal health efforts. right favor first left second. course first much help early stages pretty much eradicated virus.

Here Korea right attacked center-left government shutting travel China late super-spreader rallies later par course.

Faster shut-down travel right start would've great think many right-wing governments actually managed way much meaningful impact exception Australia. Wait actually gets cold... 1% matter? realize far fewer Americans died wars? brand mask wearing patriotic thing (which is). could help reframe minds lot people like think patriots yet wear masks. needs happen more, rejecting people. Reject lives, families, friend circles. keep acting like everyone politely tolerates them. anymore, call dumb fucks out, happily lost couple friends it. look face tell sound absolutely stupid everyone else excellent parting gift. Political meddling largely deflected, least far. article linked details that. could easily enforce way ""enforce"" jaywalking things like that. people follow ""unenforcible"" laws problem. tsunami... I'm Ohio people masking realize finding something amuzing whatever reason mean supportive it, yes?! Trump fucked response, question that. Take many anti fever medications can. taking tylenol monitoring temp nonstop.   wash whatever wash since late January.

My main concern someone running nose sneezed hands start touching stuff supermarket.

Biggest worry contaminating ice-cream tubs get son. like ice-cream watching youtube next thing know spacebar. Hospitals weren’t overwhelmed. flatten curve. Flattening curve never reducing overall number people infected. slow transmission hospitals weren’t overwhelmed. never were. Yep, PA shutdown too! Australian confirm, although it’s mostly US, like Europe think it’s ‘cause governments aren’t responding correctly America it’s every third person entitled, self absorbed, ignorant piece shit doesn’t want listen health officials doesn’t fit lifestyle remote possibilities convince people right thing. we've already seen doesn't. One advantages state nobody willingly goes disease vectors visit often. imagine get going going impossible Kentucky stop it. imagine this

"" hey brother, want go ball steaming together ? ""

imagine look i'll get sentence.   Bring dead!

Bring ya dead!  April year; 6 months ago; don’t let wash country?”** Trump asked, question others told Post president raised repeatedly Oval Office. Fauci, head National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, realized surprise Trump serious, Post reported. President,” Fauci responded, according Post. “Many people would public comments time also indicate considering scenario get economy moving — despite toll. said repeatedly “cure cannot worse problem itself,” implying saving lives could less important saving economy. claimed without evidence people would die weak economy pandemic.

This policy Trump followed along; next nothing, &amp; hope virus goes away quickly, protect economy people. Young people outside wearing masks? Scientific consensus safer many things.

Of course, hinged participants going local bars curfew getting shwasted prove point. Fyi even got back January antibody test would probably come negative body stops producing active antibodies months. cells still remember produce antibodies, without active virus system fight actively create antibodies. there's nothing really test way know. house always Thanksgiving central. wife cook days, lay huge spread tons people over.

This year, we're allowing anyone over. prepared response. There's anger whole lot bargaining. ""What come over, that's safe, right?""

We've offered plates go, pile 'em visit people outside, think we'd insulted everyone. 

Thanksgiving going kill people somehow I'm asshole. yeah therapist never laugh anxious thoughts matter distorted. give tools evaluate cognitions find new balanced thoughts decide right wrong! [rogue 2069 think anyone would really complain get shot every year even every six months

Not me. friend covid heart problems. He's 46. :( *high five* uncertainty certainly compounds stress. don’t mind sharing, like it/would say lingering effects? problem feed right hands anti mask conspiracy theorists. 

For many months saying government gradually roll new mandates prepare everyone obey everything finale everyone get mark beast. **NO, JOKING!**

I family member wear mask respects science told mark beast conspiracy nuts threatened stop talking denying Bible. WTF happening people? 

I wish day one would ordered everyone wear masks face fines. create big mess. think best could strongly advise people wear them. Much love Check back 2 weeks. always trails behind surge case numbers Really? H1N1 let run wild U.S world. There's still lots people dying U.S. News flash: nothing done back too. Americans love find superhero type dark situations hero never really there. Reaganomics! probably meant roundabout, cultasac, messed well. thats thing Joe really thinks control ... make law wear masks. cannot appalled two things different magnitude?

Also I'm aware decades long invasive wars china started recently false pretenses kill hundreds thousands civilians global net torture black sites.

No america genociding people atm, longer time ago. Atm okay putting children concentration camps, blowing weddings middle east killing fellow citizens literally fucking stupid put mask. Remember 10 years ago China 80 thousand cases horrified? ...yeah, freaking massive. 200k died. individual life. sounding pretty heartless.  Well, agree general. hand, think lot folks advocating common sense measures lockdowns - don’t really understand feasibility political legitimacy new policy necessarily differs due different types governments, culture, history.

I followed closely since Jan. 23, watching vids everyday, type effort basically America looked like WW2.

In order occur US, need least 90% buy-in public. 

Trump blew chances chose downplay threat. distinctly remember first news conference mid March - sent WFH right after. 

Why? We’ll never know. billions upon billions dollars stolen. Say want China least put billionaire criminals trial, found guilty, summarily executes them.

The one thing pandemic made realize everything George Carlin said completely true- country bought paid long arrived scene.

People talk national strike - lol cannot even get 90% folks agree pandemic dangerous. 

It’s easy get down, indeed power fingertips people China via political participation. It’s oligarchs retain power playing conquer divide politics.

E- put bow political tangent.

Say want Chinese communist party, everything tells deathly afraid Chinese people. Historically since 19th century, China unstable country - last almost-revolution 1989. people China started protest tomorrow, communists done, period. 

And understand protest, even one cartoon character, turn political instant. 

Whereas US, oligarchs absolutely nothing afraid of, govt worked behalf capital entire 200+ year history.

I say COVID ultimately prove biggest trickle asset transfer US history.

So see, dumbasses partly right - COVID actual fraud, way think. *laugh track*  There's stopping virus now. virus already mutated communicable less deadly. there's doubt mind basically everyone world going get virus eventually. mask wearing business closures shit still important ensures hospitals overrun obese elderly people. Ah bad, know detail. yes, believe sticky posted around mid-March bit later. thousands die day think responsible delay vaccine? willing risk tens thousands lives. one knows yet. three things true:
1.Sweden had, compared countries, lot covid deaths spring. 
2. last several months Sweden covid deaths compared many countries, eg US. Per capita US far worse.
3. Year date fewer deaths normal. 

No one hiding anything. way is. Mistakes made. Sweden slow system two month horizon. two year horizon Sweden often make changes faster almost democracy. good bad. Right pandemic handled well here. cases still don’t know one person knows one person corona virus place conspiracy theories fear mongering. Well could lock entire countries March, I’m sure old people. know crappy move is, trust there’s way Nothing weather. Sydney lockdown Autumn opened back winter. able keep control thanks restrictions contact tracing. 

Melbourne city really suffered this. Obviously people lost jobs everywhere tho made patriotic thing start. Proper marketing get people something wouldn’t otherwise. Right ya got back vet. Traveled back hometown it. Small Trump county Kansas spiking. single vet person vet wearing mask. single mask caseys. 

They’re fucking dumb. Yep **you** data topic? seem making argument question. Yup it’s almost like people change behavior new information. I’d would argue Denmark, Finland Norway tracts numbers well do. doesn’t mean bad, means good company. 

Yeah pretty much everything say misconstrued. it’s impossible fact check throw ten new issues every response give. 

But hey, not: triage used everywhere time. Intubation related ICU care unforgiving many elderly wouldn’t survive it. giving choice based chance survival resources. never depleted recourses (ICU-beds) draw harsh lines old people didn’t receive ICU care. would survived given. yea, used triage one claiming otherwise.

No. herdimmunity conspiracy theory (that’s become none emails ever point goal) debunked completely. two studies came Stockholm early indicated 25% antibody rate ammonia population got attention tegnell. looked ultimately concluded viable strategy. never aimed decisions never corresponds heard immunity goal. doesn’t make sense considering recommendations. rate would take decades reach heard immunity. Don’t see dumb argument sounds?

Cheated emergency numbers? haven’t even heard conspiracy perhaps pulled one straight ass? 

But guess username would never allow change mind. one side fence spring (my post history confirms this). data change new information comes out. I’m glad see find deaths Americans funny. Congrats lot success us, don’t think situation funny. Nepotism never works. trumps live bubble, appear ignorant many fronts. Like Swedish misinformation masks?

Yes, herd immunity ""element"" it. wanted heard immunity people started dying. Tegnell hardly save saying it, keeps fixating made immunity numbers spring. mentor Giesecke says loud. Biggest one-day increase...so far. example responded to, police responding person speeding. weren’t speeding speed. 

That’s went example did. agree always better support claim sources, want point providing outdated sources march much better sounds like wanting win point online discussion me. ""Good testing"" leads lower apparent rates people little symptoms (thus going hospital) better chance discovered. ""verified specialist"" think know use good scientific practice selectively want win point internet.

That aside, agree need studies showing beyond-placebo effects remdesivir really assess usefulness. separate groups? Old people don´t want get locked care homes without contact. think would change much there's much misinformation trump virus. say home... Unless thicc come over. wonder much higher numbers would better access testing... I'm sure like states insane difficult get tested Oregon. Yeah mainly counting worst hit countries becomes difficult analyze countries lower death rate, sure seems like Germany reporting properly. approve reply. hospitals overflow critical patients start turned away receiving inferior treatment, much progress would wiped away? live Dallas, TX, way we’re structured mask mandate pretty smart. puts enforcement businesses worked actually really well.

If customer isn’t wearing mask code enforcement walks in, $500 fine business every customer wearing mask. Almost every business Dallas County zero tolerance policy wearing masks. Yep Even Nazi Germany, majority Germans nice decent people. Unfortunately, ones guns.

Even 20 guns start shit Y'all Qaeda myself.

It's kind disenfranchisement. can't afford civil war regular citizen almost soft power. states sorta kinda enacting lukewarm way enforced mandate led several assassination attempts/plans least 3 4 elected officials. Sorry guys, isn’t happening US Americans fucking crazy. Sounds like wife's new boss. Fucking assholes. Well keep dying resurrections (yet). Let’s go Penn State! Ive 3 different doctors office three didnt practice social distancing didnt always wear mask common areas. feel bad students North Rhine Westphalia, two days schools begins two week holiday 4000 cases 24 hours 17 million federal state (Rookie numbers compared Netherlands, rises fast). students class 1 4 don´t need wear masks classrooms packed 30 students. want keep schools opened normal costs, like want professional soccer play costs. 0.1% massive Chinese, 6 cases city 9 million ""big alert"" Chinese. pick one 1000 10,000 Chinese people think masks useless, buy lottery. Similarly, pick 0.1% Chinese people believe Dr Zhong's epidemic prevention advice, harder winning lottery. avoid exaggeration, write 100%. Yes, vast majority Republicans. them, right completely unencumbered vastly important lives around them. They're sociopaths. since April mean confusing? makes sense. drowning stupid. sure downvoted. clarification helpful. Belgium struggling bad. state enforce mandate loses federal funding. Worked speed limits drunk driving laws. pay rent groceries? money falls sky? job? I'm Canada I've seen exact thing, everyone city wearing masks; traveled smaller city 30 minutes away yesterday store people maskless- even saw entire family 4 kids masks- staring (with mask) odd one... Rapid testing would help. Testing US, average citizen, relatively slow, promotes spread. Contact tracing spotty. goodness kars 4 kids song horrendous. almost always spend holidays (Thanksgiving xmas) favorite aunt &amp; uncle, often three us. (My uncle likes children, amusing reasons.) year. He's poor health number years I'm going risk it, even I'm taking precautions. Hard tell GOP governors honest I'm one thing life I'm wrong lot.

You can't grow recognize wrong that's okay, realize fix it.  punching nose imagine. hope koolaide tasted good drank it. You’re frog pot thinking wait long enough you’ll get turn trough. It’s never gonna happen. favourite going people still say Fauci said masks unnecessary beginning, assume situation static unchanging That’s accurate comparison. correct comparison would saying police allowed speed responding call, are. Surgeons can’t cut someone open they’re surgery. police speeding driving responding call. legally allowed it. president said ""we start wearing masks around other, good idea right thing do."" would cost zero dollars, pass laws, pick pen. dumbass could type phone thumbs 30 seconds people would listen would save lives. Yep would easy Germany accurate too. Vietnam: yo fuck happening thought Covid long ago bruh Fuck Dr fauci Organized events cancelled. company work home since March - we’re certainly going get together holiday party won’t even go office. number 1... know extended family going angry refuse come holidays 60s 70s. wanna take risk that's fine I'm going responsible definitely true, cases come private gatherings. That's bunch people work got it. &amp; event one ""cold"". Almost everyone &amp; event caught it. Nobody got attend event everyone else work fine. 6 infected people one died 3 weeks later. Yep Shows difference health issues make. Without them, virus almost nothing point need start seriously considering excess mortality numbers part death toll. roughly 300,000 excess deaths 2020, quite likely COVID-19 pandemic catastrophic numbers. beyond deaths, there's ""long haulers"" battling symptoms months months end sight.

This happens charlatan buffoon considered ""leader"".  good gd. almost 1.3 million test today compared around 200k per day March/May would make sense number positive cases rise IFR decline.



April 24th 290k tests 35k cases

Oct 23 1.3 million tests 83k would leave us positivity rate of:

April = .12 rate

Oct = .06 rate

that outstanding improvement accounts

why brought talk new case numbers?
****  Says guy obviously voted billionaire snake oil salesmen every police officer seen since started wearing masks ridiculous. great countries world play along democratic hoax sway election /s person behind blog famous novelist blogger (famous Sweden, is). Specifically writes economics military defence. known careful facts. First day shit hole country? make sure turn people zombies. feeling that's next thing coming 2020. problem abortion. People hate thing A, vehemently oppose things B, C, would help prevent thing A. College kids living lives. disease going endemic time start living life. state city mask mandate. hotel franchise work mandate. Bosses/owners chastised today political suggesting enforcing mandate review saying “we didn’t harass people wearing masks” bad business. Free? Okay, I’ll take two then... Stop trying virtue signal based pandemic. idiot get virus, spread math equation le Reddit upvotes work high school, we've three students teacher get COVID. coworkers maskless happy hour Buffalo Wild Wings (I participate). Even people think way smarter content area pandemic. barely clean, work constantly pull masks down, hopeless situation. Well pandemic bring idiots among us. 

Probably idiots them. share reckless people. I’d contend can’t human clean hands, definition clean hands. Here's totally uninformed opinion without reading article:

It's safe sit next contagious person hours-long plane flight.

It's less unsafe contagious seatmate wearing masks, still safe. Misinformation general causes harm, sweden's policy changed significantly, ""herd immunity"" element it. Order 'what crap' yea never seen smart board used, maybe once? always thought pretty useless got pulled cop august wasn’t wearing mask. Didn’t seem like good idea insist get one let speak three feet me. Best guess March IFR 0.9% best guess IFR 0.9%, may differ depending age distribution healthcare. virus changed. condoms stop airborne stds ..just sayin

... Wut? fault all. basically asking kids miss year 20 lives grandma get year 87. 

Theres kids old people get young once. 

This disease endemic. risk people continue isolate waiting vaccine, people going get coronavirus many times lives. Even vaccine. want world ending. want excuses see families pretend like anyone taking seriously science denier. reality, they’re ones ignoring science Wow government officials would FUCKKKKKKKKING LISTEN HIM. 2-4 weeks entire country if. That’s it. ACTUALLY. Incompetence ignorance going kill many more. It’s minimal thing too, yet people act like it’s oppression infringing rights wear one.  I'm good news Metro tabloid? Third wave? WTF second... right idea! required anyone wearing fined 10k really abusing terminology here. want say billionaire's net worth artifact stock market, somewhat agree that. actual income billionaire derive assets (stock dividends, corporate bond coupon, buyback) come operating profits corporations. Uni set go like 10% person/90% online 75% person/25% online spring semester I'm frustrated it. fucking reason ramp person much quick, especially people coming back holidays. Long term immunity probably won’t thing unless successful vaccine developed. four coronaviruses make typical common cold know get cold every year. virus speads mostly air. could pick surface, immediately touched face touching surface, spreading air covid-19 does. nightmare, we're seeing. 2 years long time. Watch reinfections call Dupa means ass Polish. Ballpoint Pen (długoPIS) signs everything party (PIS) gives sign. Surge cases increased testing. 10 times testing clearly get cases.  didn’t get point “checking boxes” caring health before

That’s don’t get people here. majority Americans didn’t give fuck health this. would now?  r/Sino posters fuck off, unbelievable. lot easier nearly full totalitarian government prevent sort thing nations. mention, best interest make sure vast majority people happy possible, full pandemic ravaging country would damage control people.

There perhaps merit questioning overall numbers first wave, however, clear back normal part. Hum! Anyone who's ever Ear Nose Throat doctor knows feeling ""having brain tickled""! will, far people voluntarily attend. It’s going well, 3.5% test positive Thanks. sometimes feels like people see competition room nuance. it’s good another country hit worse luck major factor outbreak occurs. end it’s big pile shit together. need to. I'm Arizona. Back May/June went optional mask mandates. ""enforcement"" measures put place. anecdotal, places I've visiting mask wearing went 25% well 90%. Probably 95%. literally happened overnight.

If make law, people follow it.  constitution govt given power such? say hi Clippy Also best medical care money can't buy likely disease spreads easily winter people huddled inside, cases low start winter, mean ""second wave"" (we never stopped riding first) exponentially worse be. 

83,000 cases one day. Think number people people could infected vs hundred thousand bothered get handle summer. US probably change much doing, doubt much country go strict lockdowns saw spring. going really, really rough winter. True can’t result mandatory 2 week ban. many good Americans many give fuck might right. Nascar baby! mask fine $25 Omaha. Yes. that’s he’s replying to. comment replying stated masks make COVID go away sooner. 100% true would think deaths OK? ideal world one dies Covid. doesn’t change true, CDC-provided fact death rate 0.4%. Last time logged fox news saw two different photos Hillary Clinton. That's they're focusing guess. would assume based read, Sweden much better compliance COVID recommendations even without mandates many Western countries. probably due culture trust government anything. could expect level compliance America, obstinate little bastards (just ask Great Britain😜). Anyways, compliance fairly decent reason deaths became higher expected Sweden solely due COViD infiltrating nursing homes, reasons simple masking social distancing could prevented deaths communicable diseases. pure speculation, lot factors beyond COVID contribute death toll year. Massive societal changes, better worse, probably biggest one. No. Completely false. Herd immunity goal people started dying. like doctors Russia murdered *debunked*. Nothing *debunked*. People criticize Russia *conspiracy theorists*. like people criticize Swedish corruption.

 Giesecke still shut immunity. said let covid19 wave ""wash over"" societies even one month ago. Calling ""two studies"" ""Tegnell interested"" complete nonsense. obsessed immunity months. always overestimated it.

No, behave yourself. Swedes proud never going capacity emergency care. that's triaging used elderly care. try use creative accounting start looking something else. Excess deaths. Emergency care numbers. GDP. There's always something new previous one fails. look *total deaths*, criminals charge elderly care need punished. ""Fun"" fact. deaths 1918 pandemic occured October/November 1918. Around 250,000 Americans died September December 1918. contrast, 36,000 people reported died period 1915. deaths 1918 pandemic primarily caused bacterial pneumonia. suspect covid occured 1918, without widespread antibiotics, might even fatal Spanish flu.  Wow. Selfish assuming gender? wow. bigot. black trans little person literally shaking right now. 1918 flu able spread remotest parts Alaska 6 months. easy move around country. easier ever planes, trains, automobiles. Low population density days inevitable. virus travels fast us. want excuses see families pretend like anyone taking seriously science denier.

I actually thinking thing. frustrates many upvotes blatant misinformation (lies) getting here. I'll add little information occasionally like memory B Cells Cells (maybe even paper), like trying chat think 10K people died US COVID. worth time basing position facts critical thinking.

It seems way world right now. One extreme other.

The internet mistake, lol behind who? lockdown students?  man...... won’t. We’re learning live this. Yes, hear messaging. Messaging horrible beginning. However, it’s obvious plan hold vaccine approved. Right, Philly, lots underserved neighborhoods throwing large block parties masks sight. It’s shit-show. change good bad that's accessibility. far many people believe either a.) virus exist/isn't bad, b.) ok wear mask people wearing one, c.) ok there's distance. course disregarding distance actually 6ft. mind, it’s weird categorize land mass large US way statistically meaningful. It’s simply large. virus, borders arbitrary inconsequential. follow graph cases throughout US, you’ll see many areas haven’t hit peak hitting peak, areas hit peak repeating peak (nyc). idea measuring waves anything bigger zip code asinine. sound like teenager. JIS slovak abbreviation, english one ICU. bringing politics it? nothing that. can't say get worse people act say dangerous. Point lead world death pandemic mishandled leadership. Oh boy. terrible job controlling spread also making advancements Covid medical treatment (which will) that's hard concept. things usually good bad. Third world demographics vastly different west. Younger populations, less obesity, higher exposure infectious diseases gives edge. It’s one reason whole Africa (1.2 billion population) 40000 covid deaths. Covid less non issue compared infectious diseases circulating there. Emulating west regards lockdowns May done damage help. pesky Constitutions they'd gotten away it, too!  Yeah, means even easier you. individual cities. 

The china strategy basically view corona guerrilla warfare. cases pop organize testing capacity entire country flood city. use cellphone gps electronic payment data contact tracing. 

The weakness strategy human error. solve firing absolutely everyone responsible tries cover fuck up. 

Although eventually long incubation cases human error let cases slip through. repeat flood city tests strategy. 

People understand careful China encouraging masks. china version Dr.Birx. got award something photographed without mask. picture, made point note took mask talk put back afterwards. 1,132 new cases per 100,000 people, meaning roughly one every 88 people state tested positive last two weeks.

I don’t get it. 10 000 cases total number recorded cases since beginning, people active infection?

If it’s former, isn’t using “active cases” wrong? Besides obvious Paris, wondering price would 'wir schaffen das' injecton millions people Europe, answer seems medical care that's harder get to, higher possibility infection corona, noise, pollution. Life expectancy going 70-80? Kids problem focusing screens TV - suspect fault lies content ... raging everywhere... except Asia. Outside Indonesia India, Asia seems control. No, best handling covid. worst. bad spring. Right steady sane better European countries. Gov likely enforce mandatory covid testing borders 24hr old neg result nationwide testing starts. vaccine! let everyone then. fair, 9pm curfew 2/3 country masks required indoors many, many locales. Now, would convince folks pack restaurants enforce teleworking, encourage it. He's frail? stick gonna kill something lol Younger population, lower testing, warmer weather.

It's prevalent too, worry. I’m mathematician something numbers It’s ironic ones call people sheep say thing. Hmmmmm family one. think one bit broad statement.
Most Ok ... hey muh freedums blah blah blah fake take pres etc etc, seems outnumbered wear masks time change 1-2 times day wash too. 12 masks wash wear spare box blue masks work truck car case drop masks not. one half us US citizens wearing half cry constitutional right HUGE problem never go away Wrong. Totally wrong. company put official paperwork front doors prove official authorization remain open roving police watches, that's shut me. businesses needed prove right remain open!!!!! That's exactly economy failed! Everyone closed!!!!!! Roads highways desolate. Haha ok.  Shouldn’t grounds removal? can’t decide laws they’re going enforce, they? Psychopathic option vaccine Yeah, point great people can't afford it. Capability something based affordability.  Look daily cases viz viz daily testing. 
1.3 million tests done resulting 83k cases. come Trump interfered CDC recommendations.  Therefore, trustworthy right now.  faith CDC hopefully much greater 4 months now. damn app, would able keep track fine. report anybody us God damn using this. Contact tracing US joke. Small correction, antigene tests, PCR. necessarily. It’s longer appropriate compare Europe foreshadow US. noted yesterday, regions substantively different aspects outbreaks, including restrictions surge patterns. Many states West coast Northeast maintained long term restrictive NPIs European officials largely dropped following Spring. alone would influence spread. It’s possible we’ll see substantial resurgence northeast, NPIs work all, won’t bad as, say, France seeing right now. opened early, one reopen vaccines. NY one cautious reopenings. Thanks, ☹️  borders open, decided happen borders nationwide testing next week.

One options everyone enters also need go Ag test borders. However probably enough soldiers implement nationwide testing time. Flattening curve vertically I’m pretty sure herd immunity wouldn’t even work well biggest risk factor I’ve seen obese. Guess percentage obese Americans? 60%. We’re healthy nation. ridiculous amount comorbidities across ages. think absolutely right lot people motivation. said, think people interest want ignore virus, they're desperate bit hope countries never going close borders, go back full lockdown also gone high death rate care home deaths.

They fully accept need universal mask wearing range measures. degree resignation political go another 2-3 month lockdown govt never institute mandatory hotel quarantine. 

I.e. whatever reason countries blown politically viable opportunity go Asia Pacific route.

I'm thinking UK. course APAC route best they're desperate sign something like Sweden approach might eventually lead slightly less relentless case growth death. table says around 1.1-1.3% increase deaths/1000 every year 2014 year.

That trend. Trend fluctuation, trend. quick calculations, removed trend. remaining differences fluctuations then. know fit curve, try yourself. Wait stick nose test wore out? Mentally physically possible sneeze really hard after? Fuck you. want mandate federal land that’s fine. I’m going wear goddamn mask something 99.99% survivability rate. Yeah. wasn’t saying data wasn’t there, use recovery rate 90% title. don’t think tells anyone anything. Unless I’m missing something.  JFC Man, I've always thought lockdown one time thing, hospital capacity give 17 days ICU' beds filled Germany. lockdown sight handicapped read originally said. Dumb rock. mandates removed seatbetls, speed limits public nudity

All heavily encroaching freedom

/s cos reddit Still get pulled over, process, claim guilty form mail in, finally take go court. fun all. Lmao honestly know someone called police father child drunk driving kid back seat. cop said ""its illegal drink texas"". Texas cops give shit weed (or course), youre homeless POC, shoplifting, obvious rape murder. need 110 outlet.

Try pushing add 110 outlets bunch parking spaces. Yeah, I've heard people thing we're Canada. refuse test kid want mandatory quarantine test positive. That's say, Asa wraps flag claims great job, consistently shows give shit.  mean US less shit instance seen separate charge. $25 every time, repeat offense charges Data there.

Define seasonality. mean people going inside due inclement weather, I’ll agree. it’s aspect virus becomes worse it’s cold, zero, mean zero, evidence that. 

Even so, think relevant factors, including behavior restriction levels.  You’re making lots assumptions based false premise everyone else MUST dumber you. assumptions false. soon single case US battened hatches, haven’t left house without mask since.

Your whole position seems “everyone idiot I’ll opposite they’re doing.”

How listening science recognizing shit like first blows up, nobody knows anything, including scientists. time goes by, data available get better grasp things. ignoring advice couple bad calls early shows don’t understand science even works. didnt know states didnt playbook given respective state CDC team. isnt thing. nope. governors mayors responsibility this. got it. “Adapt” implies level planning, coordination, conscious public health action happening lol. know things. important know course illness stages give treatments appropriate stages. Ditto. I'm homeschooling 2 boys year intense... I'm put ton effort giving best education possibly can, free-time gone. alternative makes feel sick, I'll keep this. years prepare states proper PPE supplies

Thats think stats given unbiased way possible. Covid19 basically revealing limitations Western democracy. led expert fundraisers networkers competent administrators. blows mind there's countries already moved pandemic are... Honestly, seemed like pandemic little news covers now. yet, we've hit new daily record. saw infograph CNN today showed Missouri’s numbers green (improving). one three states showing improvements. like MO ask, state skew data? There’s way improving here. MO states something skew count covid 19 positives? people fired spot mandate civilian wear mask shod charged 10% monthly salary. way even rich people can't get away it. keep repeating: Sweden among densely populated countries Europe (unless count population divided area whole country - viruses don’t care about). Look distance people. Look urbanization. Everything good. one many natural selections 21st century “Less deadly” speaks people strong immune systems, there’re asthmatic people struggle breathe would strongly affect think general vibe say 'at least literally everyone get covid, cause would 2% entire US population dead', often fudge factor like herd immunity number. idea like actively force people spread virus rapidly possible, praised. “Great job” - T&amp;E Wtf. think virus gives shit custody arrangements? called withdrawal probably. remember characters responded line probably something like complain long it’s taking  even close. 8 years old daughter syndrome. going school person. saw lot regression remote. It’s tough choice special need parents Yup. governor like ""Fuck guys"" Coronavirus Taskforce end March, decided instead base policy recommendations state health experts. city's mayor. That's Swamp Thing hates them. Lol yes the. Corona virus response local president failure. leader fights science get failure... see gop response environment. tested 1.3 million people today. saying testing severely limited? That’s positivity rate 6.5%. That’s lower middle June middle August. height 7 day rolling average 8.3% excluding beginning pandemic even testing 400,000 day. Wow ignorant Anglo refusing basic research American imperialism, surprising. ex-wife gave kid. Nothing masks ineffective. Convincing people take necessary precautions partly meant ""getting control."" time he's office, it'll almost year Trump telling everyone big deal. many people already made minds, change minds, wont things *really* bad. keep wearing masks asking others stay socially distant us. dumbest 40% country wants force return ""normal"" political points mean rest us suffer. guarantee stay safe that's nothing new. work paramedics united states actually think thing hoax. One woman CHARGE testing entire western half state. I'm even sure react point lol actually surprising people surprised this.

At rate we're going, half million pretty good. mean, look shit... Look country... Fucking *look it.*

40% nation decided sacrifice other's lives acceptable, long wear fucking mask change behavior way.

America filled selfish, sociopathic morons. deserve this. Covid fatigue (who doesn't?). still wear damn mask (and goggles too, necessary). fuck cares. scared, stay home quit demanding everyone else bend make feel comfortable. Fucking reddit better idea happening governments. watched whilst China going extreme measures try contain virus, yet governments nothing. Cases popping countries prompted seemingly response. UK, universities recognized threat two three weeks government made first actual response, late then, causing far many early deaths. knew one person died it, someone taught school went years prior. hurt many people died decades time.

Fuck majority western governments, earlier responses. Reinfection real thing

Where get information from? article linked **Until know more, Poland says possibility getting COVID-19 twice shouldn’t make anyone one fearmongering.

This entire subreddit fearmongering left right. Yall keep crying world exploding hasnt. yall keep saying millions people US gonna die yet barely hit 230k nearly 12 months. Less 1% 350 **million** people country.

Look *dude*. get it. Everyones worried. worried fearmonger using articles discredit anything say. even read full article? like *reading* things, way get full information fearmongering shit like *YoU kNoW rE-iNfEcTiOn tHiNg RiGhT?* Hospital filling unfortunately. Sorry :( live Brooklyn. Currently experiencing outbreaks due hasidic nutters refusing masks simultaneously throwing insane parties. people suck.   I’d interested see testing capacity comparison case numbers. Many places live test referral. friends said office staff testing labs acted upset chastised getting test close contact didn’t symptoms. Honest question: tests, percentage cases go up, one talking fact percentage deaths decreasing cases have. corona viruses makes sense case counts go up, testing people, know it’s nearly deadly people thought. Ok opinion completely devoid value matter. Bye.  implied people afford put kids college afford medical insurance.

Yes. Families who's kids go college money leave kids inheritance usually upper middle able afford piddling ass bill like school put big boy leagues afford major illness US.'

Lol maybe check tuition private colleges universities.  Tbh isn’t issue you’re making be, kinds people lowest common denominator absolutely last care crafting action like Numbers don’t scare us anymore. immune hearing kind news I'm Taipei family friends US saying well. told hell no. least Taiwan free healthcare, also way confident CDC here. end October, Taiwan 600 cases total, including imported cases.  can’t control something small easily contagious. always morons refuse basics like wearing mask, can’t wear mask social fucking distance it’s hard, washing hands etc. times optimism better pessimism suggest ""at time assessment"" global pandemic ONE TIMES. 

In fact pandemic call ""pessimism"". would call ""caution"" even ""common sense"". roommate complaining air quality fires ignored advice opened windows work. told wear mask said “but it’s hot”. 2 million dead number took literally 0 precautions let Covid it’s thing. wasn’t realistic goal striving for. Trump? Go ahead fire him. Dude I'm saying underreporting factor 10. are. Absolutely. 2 billion people live China way longer here. CCP LYING rest world they're totalitarian regime. apparently math ain’t strong suit.

We right 100 hundred days til Feb 1, US 230k deaths averaging 700 covid deaths day months.

So hit 300k counted deaths (with excess deaths 30 percent higher) feb 1 current rate. Rather want shutdown essential stuff keep enjoyable stuff around? Sounds like interesting plan xD lock downs city wide sterilization using drones thousands people sprayers, twice day. government (for better worse) capable enforcing lock quarantines. also had(have?) checkpoints taking peoples temperature along road. 

The numbers totally believable. arguments used outside USA? Sure, except there's nothing funny amusing pandemic flu that's far killed nearly quarter million Americans. things la right now? super-spreaders super-spreading super-spread. Oh man... Covid orgies?  Repugnicans stop nothing lure us hippies. graph shows testing hasn’t significantly increased since July. However case numbers definitely increased disproportionately. course probably won’t care since you’re little bubble denial anyway Cali court starting side fathers equally past years. Totally pitted dewds Hell, Herman Cain died COVID Twitter account *still* tweets COVID conspiracy propaganda day. ""I'm afraid quit drinking cumulative hangover would literally kill me.""

 -Sterling Archer leave

That work someone live US first place, gonna try lot harder that. Hamburg prople respecting social distance, wearing mask properly, met person washcenter refused wear mask, bars, restaurants schools open, public transport always full busy hours, etc. 

At beginning pandemic closed, people concerned, supermarkets security enforcing 2m distance. went supermarket yesterday people respect aocial distance nobody enforcing it. also control number customers inside supermarkets anymore. [If historical record specific dangers second wave pandemic could reflect upon.] well! ideas might got it?

One thing heard NPR that's worth considering.

We many dickheads walking around masks. potentially talk, breath, sneeze, cough, get Covid-19 surface. You, wearing mask, thouch surface, point touch face/eyes. that's people may getting infected despite taking precautions seriously.

So guess moral story wear mask forget washing hands too. That's freedom stake everyone like ""nooo, we're close!"" I’m jealous, still first wave US. wave never ending. GW Bush read book 1918 pandemic holiday 2005 strengthened US pandemic preparedness result, understanding massive threat posed poorly prepared country strategy designed meet three critical goals: First, must detect outbreaks occur anywhere world; second, must protect American people stockpiling vaccines antiviral drugs, improve ability rapidly produce new vaccines pandemic strain; and, third, must ready respond federal, state local levels event pandemic reaches shores

In hindsight makes sense, work GW Obama thrown completely ignored current administration.

Global international cooperation absolutely vital preventing controlling outbreaks become pandemic. US incredible resources cooperating countries able better protect - shutting borders pretending everything OK long term strategy work. getting appealed? Health orders constitutional. Yep, year slowest ever guess ending time soon now. course. Probably factor 10.

There almost 2 BILLION people China. 85,000 cases straight true. state whose political economic system become weak government longer control.

I would say already case America. much might rising back Europe, empirically much worse US continues be. federal government US could saved many lives president around simply pushed masks past 7 months. president downplays virus constantly, mocks mask wearing, attacks scientists (including Fauci), withheld help states governors didn’t publicly grovel like mob boss much more. going rallies every day social distancing huge lack masks, virus taking big time states. 

I think could forgiveable government trying hard virus much. Instead, government actively spreading misinformation causing *more* preventable deaths. Trump’s administration set guidelines opening states immediately ignored them. States follow mocked president, including tweeting states “liberated.” It’s infuriating buying do-nothing GOP talking points think couldn’t helped more. Nobody said anyone would going without food months I’ll say something stupid irrelevant too. 

The sky blue.

Damn Funny ""America reports biggest daily increase record"" top sub instead ""World reports biggest daily increase"".

It’s actually 99.6% survive, 99.4% God reeks arrogance...and irony. 46 believe. Also, pre-existing issues overweight. Hi. Two coworkers exposed virus week (they're brothers, boss tested positive) kept came work today, saying anything working hours hung coworkers day prior. know do, contact coworkers.

One perhaps, driver, got trip trip, knows. imagine stop eat restaurant - would wearing sure. feel ya dude. wife terrified covid, able get 10 days insane symptoms without her. disinfect wear mask around her.

Hope feels better soon! really idea much China like huh. even heard Chinese traditional medicine?  may, yes people may upset someone else took advantage imho country killing hundreds past flu seasons without remorse, lives important werent caused covid-19?

Hope see error ways plan annual lockdowns coming flu seasons save people.  fucking insane, china's fucking fault. Sense self entitlement, stubbornness, stupidity got us here. 

We're international embarrassment also look facts looking total cases. 

We tested 1.3 million people today. That’s positivity rate 6.5%. That’s lower middle June middle August. height 7 day rolling average 8.3% time. 

Our 7 day rolling average 5.8% fatality rate significantly since July/August 4.5% around 2.6%. 

This sub needs stop using total cases decent metric measure status virus. Ah, yes referencing masks work 100% posts you? know better, you? Masks work 0%. cause breathe carbon dioxide pass they? Reddit wants deny that, they? Teach us, wise one. People don’t seem understand big 1% 330,000,000 (also death rate closer 5% whatever) citizen actually believed lived evil imperialist state, moral thing leaving? left nazi Germany right? Looking stats seems like 3rd wave could easily see anti-mask protests like anti-lockdown protests earlier year.  Uncle said never wear mask since Law saying infringeing freedoms. Also never told leave places wearing one told wear one. Smoker currently lives grandparents. fact gotten virus miracle. \^ fox news brain. reddit better idea happening governments. 

I know, right?! Seriously, *what fuck*. criminally inexcusable Ah yes, toilet paper madness 2020. remember like well... remember absolutely catch once, scientifically demonstrated fact. likely. immediate. happen. Oh there’s charge paid worry vaccine simply weeks away! lie something like right? strong survive. mean clearly three distinct waves.. trend keeps going tho fake news---he said cause delay---he's ind. board look it. Maybe isn’t contagious?

Also idk hell news covering US country, drunk driver killing someone, rape ending murder kids dying hot car make least state news. Also they’re recorded feels like ultras rioting. therefore... Constructive interference multiple waves get one really big wave? /s haven’t put part life hold first month chaos. Back work, state opened go anytime want. Life great long get lockdown gloomers piss off. Good hear! (The recovery part is) government plenty money, doesn’t want spend covid tests. Graham Weston want spend money covid tests, say good thank helping keep kids safe government won’t it.

If think government priorities wrong, election coming up, choose change makes decisions. 1.4 billion people China unlike America people actually believe science follow rules, also tradition wearing masks like rest East Asia, I'll leave reply someone made previous comment:

""Not lock downs city wide sterilization using drones thousands people sprayers, twice day. government (for better worse) capable enforcing lock quarantines. also had(have?) checkpoints taking peoples temperature along road.""

Just imagine Korea steroids. Half White House sick pandemic month, including president himself, it’s run anti-mask moron keeps anti-mask rallies. sarcasm, thing said summer

(I’m seeing lot idiots think covid go quickly, lost taste identifying sarcasm ) nah trump. italian problems, absolutely exacerbated south. everybody nervous they're taking advantage. pretty standard viruses become less deadly time. Killing host sure way stop spread virus. means less deadly strains outcompete deadly strains. Unclear something see timescale months decades COVID though. theres real optimism right Thank you. able make money world class infrastructure paid taxes. Please refrain ""Spongebob text"" car bunch friends NPR happen radio drove weed shop. believe it. finally walked shop everyone shop shocked expression knew knew.


I think went grocery store everyone everywhere talking it. Wtf? dumb reason like someone. trying find something real?

""So disingenuous"" lmao  spiral giant corner? keep seeing hospitalization graphs linked- every time click trend curves moving up. missing something? Well least fun yodeling way. Fourier taught look far away enough, anything oscillating Ah yes. Perfect argument. Show information proves argument wrong. love mind, that’s different thing making money expense, knows proportion billionaires actually applies to, ok. hear perspective. Trump obviously idiot, representation people got president first place. America screwed government, screwed people. People think government solution problems choose old fart monkeys. Thats I'm never moving back. America joke everyone outside. ain't laughing Trump, laughing Americans. Helping countries stop eradicate diseases helps US. incredibly narrow world view think ""fuck them, American"" think providing assistance expertise foreign disease control groups come back fuck over.

Zika incredibly good example this. anyone paste article?

It's behind paywall know get around it.  lot universities planned months ago students would return Thanksgiving break.  phase 3? spread awareness spreads voter apathy reduces donations towards democrat republican candidates alike (they're blame shit). least tell people general criticisms leave country lol. Bars allowed reopen Michigan 2 weeks ago..and are. immune, numb. No. Someone said recovered Covid19. showed yelling may may long term damage may may exist. Tell me. helpful? Think second.

No, one person Transverse Myelitus.

Statistically trial people going illnesses. I’m course concerned, rush get back live remember it, can’t scrap everything one case didn’t think related.

Please link article cases so, otherwise stop spreading lies. masks 100% effective BLM protests ok? told since wearing masks issue. Wow. existential dread Italy's dead started rising laughable compared now. Yup sad, start virus got politicized. That's convinced shit getting real - NBA game teams come start game player ended testing positive. shut (and pretty much sports) right after. work going dry run working home couple weeks later, state shut everything left office March 21st could that, we've working home since. I've spent time current company working home office, may ever go back one.  Qingdao testing 9 million people 6 people contracted virus. 

That's one city btw testing whole US. love literally cherry-picking information article. Mac Daily News?

Hilarious. New York City alone testing 100,000+ day hospitals get overwhelmed choose treat AGAIN. forget delay cases deaths.
Is hospitals getting better keeps IFR low, virus less infectious. France almost twice many cases UK almost half many deaths? UK undercounting again? week, cdc definition close contact required within 6 ft case 15 minutes considered “close contact”.  

So according people MT put together plan, spend 14.5 minutes standing next confirmed case, leave 15 minutes up, safe.  


It’s stupid. Following letter rule without understanding means.  probably causing spread people say still. 

Now cdc definition 15 minutes cumulative 24 hour period. vaccine already rushed. companies actually skipped animal trials went straight human testing claiming cut corners. realizing much money save eating out, I’m done eating like rest life. It’s got big raise. agree would considered right-wing last 100 years Argentina also crap, disagree copied model. dictatorships obviously fascist, nothing alike French. De La Rua Macri — I’m mentioning they’re recent — aren’t right-wing imo, maybe Argentine standards, they’re social-liberal/social-democrat. Macri, example, increased taxes, regulations, controlled prizes, etc. Menem actual right-wing president elected since Peron. 

I agree Peron wasn’t one caused problems, said catalyst, problems started UCR imo. P.A.N predecessors, Argentina country highest GDP per capita immigrants world coming here. wasn’t big wealth-gap people think, Sarmiento promoted free education people couldn’t afford it, wealth gap actually shrank. still agree you’re saying, hope another ideology besides Radicals Peronists gets power. Yeah round corner right side cliff. someone Wisconsin, true New Zealand. Although think everyone handling better US. place poorly ones mandating mask usage. lagging 10 days, like spring. effects curfew, etc show week.  thing. spreading it, they're getting it. Well guess. mean, one's gonna look raise kids (except pay), wanna spend significant portion income childcare (like even usual), headache. Total lunacy complete short-sightedness. high-risk child privilege homeschooling. send school bc work bc virtual option available, I'd angry parents can't see past doorstep terrified every time dropped girl knowing selfish people sending sick kids school concern life own...not kid's, sadly, either. fair Illinois Minnesota laugh Wisconsin time get chance literally care unless caught virus huh? go location get tested free. Yeah many schools PA (ours, Fox Chapel School District, included) started school first 9 weeks hybrid in-person / remote approach, slated transition full-time, person starting second 9 week grading period. spread happen public.
It's behind closed doors private apartments never see it. high fatality rate would par flu. 230k :( :( :( spending time family making miserable.


True, least based Divorce Spike Warning Rest Locked-Down Filings started rising March couples emerged always continues to. past much hidden behind thin veil BS majority people daring question church. think masks bullshit. abide mask mandates time. wash hands, use hand sanitizer can. I'm taking virus seriously can. 

The economic collapse going cause death millions. Would worse let virus run unabated? know sure. what's currently happening, believe bad. never said masks main reason let's talk that; REALLY want know main reason spike is? 

Weakness. People complain wearing masks. People complain lockdowns. People complain freedoms rights CHINA. People can't go months without going bar restaurant. People feel devotion attending church matters plague. People can't even simply stop touching faces. 

These weak people. many, many Americans. 

here’s concert believe bit board oversees Idaho’s public health districts explains *a board voted 4-3 end mask mandate. Board members overseeing operations Idaho’s public health districts appointed county commissioners **not required medical member Walt Kirby said giving idea controlling spread personally care whether anybody wears mask not. want dumb enough walk around expose others, that’s fine me,” Kirby said. “Nobody’s wearing damned mask anyway. ... I’m sitting back watching catch die. Hopefully I’ll live board member, Allen Banks, denied COVID-19 making people sick, I’m pretty sure it’s coronavirus, question asking is, ‘What’s making sick?’” told medical professionals testified. one made claim yet responsibility disprove it. Classic Reddit. Sorry news - I’m glad you’re getting treatment! Good luck :) lot people “think” CV one point either never tested (bc early, tests weren’t done yet) tested negative still think it. Would love post people symptoms tjmeline. Would obv opinion based feel like November 19 Jan 20, uttering words Covid, people getting strange sicknesses. remember talking December. didn’t get AB test July negative. Spot-on. Digging man’s history shows shady past that’s putting mildly. No. government shouldn’t mandate anything fluid bleach.... cares police enforce it. mere fact, people wear one, knowing damn well there's mandate law, means they'll called people shunned public. can't count many mask freakout memes I've seen far someone calling someone else wearing one, wearing wrong, etc. Society correct itself, got start mandated law first. Trump really dropping ball one. mom this. Symptoms covid least 2 weeks oxygen immune compromised. Refused get tested ""no restrictions want another statistic."" asked wanted know, said eh. tried get go get tested gaf. Still believes people maskless whole thing overblown, prior nurse. Let's say faith person anymore. Ohh total cases!!! Lets ignore context processed tests! everything read necessarily true. I´ve seen waiting results outside. saw one situation inside room would imagine. big gym school ventilation chairs people lots space them. none measures particularly extreme anything prompt social unrest protests

it wearing masks everywhere using cctv/phone location track people moving confirmed positive

masks even mandatory, they're social norm anyways get stares don’t think 6 million 100 million criteria apportioning doses initially. frontline workers etc. 

For instance frontline worker say Argentina get vaccine 40 year old farmer Kerry. 

Anyhow wasting time debating poorly constructed point journalist.  fact distribution plans already agreed EU level expect Ireland qualify vaccinate residents initially. know family member nursing home taking seriously. mom also lives near nursing home whole place lockdown, think everyone gets certain amount time outside choose to. Family members allowed visit particular days think. Get Researcher App store look up. Due diligence responsibility. white people seem immunity. maybe allergic masks.

And I've seen black people refuse wear masks. need bring race this. seems racist. Well mormons can't bigamy anymore next best thing baby assembly line guess.  He's turning virus political right election. think right. fundamental differences amount societal empathy people have. definitely concerned today tomorrow. ever matter. don’t wish harm upon you. don’t know would “piss fire.” Typically people intrude life angry sympathetic needs. Worry know? already pay taxes people like think need contribute well everyone. 

Now everyone concerned masks. weren’t concerned pandemic, Chinese wearing masks decade. happening happened happen again. care, boycott high density areas implications highly contagious disease would cause, reel idea international travel/commerce key driver global pandemics? No. affected personally felt real consequence decided needed take efforts protect you. Get yourself. don’t empathy mask self preservation empathy hoping people save you. 🍀🍀🤞🙏🤞🍀🍀 got pulled going 47 35 started putting mask maskless cop walked up. said, ""Oh, okay ma'am, that."" Um, think will, thanks. government COULD. theres one could control norway turkey. let weak die.......that people think based actions Stop fucking worrying like idiot live life. But. freedumb? reality issues. worn properly increase chances getting viruses experts flip flopped issue since start. Sunday. Tuesday? Probably Every time think people can't surprise anymore, someone finds way undershoot expectations. lock downs? 40 year olds still go doctor 200 Million people die hunger due economic collapse world food shortages surrounding that.

I'm going need cite half assed lock downs mask measures going cause 200 million people die think good trade 2 people know Millions don't?

I'm going need citation social distancing measures partial lock downs going cause people die letting virus run wild. 

Moreover it's... kind pointless try get happen. can't mandate people go sit restaurants concerts people go grocery store maskless. state mask mandate. people abide it, least basic places go to. Anyone wearing mask wearing one properly, give wide berth stay 6 feet, 4-6 meters away them. even mask mandate, people wearing masks. going force people take off? Get infected purposefully? See: Thailand keeps giving platform? 

Time sit shut up. Covid emergency over, new flu season now. Moronmons. Apparently rare passed 2nd covid test lol. I’m young healthy, anxiety doctor said she’s seen times

Edit: also test mildly uncomfortable one felt like stabbed brain nose bled long time.... might bad testing procedure? Idk lockdowns Japan SK sure point is. welcome. think talk hang out, environments people talk lot much risky environments not, speaking generate much droplets coughing situations. Good job 🇸🇰 Pretty sure giving plague others, causing sickness death, trumps freedom religion claims. I've eaten restaurant twice recently.

Please read actual science research article posits. evidence far research tarnished flaws data collection risk among older children middle high schools less data far schools routinely testing students staff and, even identify cases, it’s difficult trace infection’s schools older children double rate infections compared taught remotely  pass mask mandate. unconstitutional. would done State Local level, Martial Law things get bad enough.

\-Arsonist lit home fire  Nah believe Hoax  people following guidelines (in general) see non compliance. Example shops public transportation? ""proffessionals"" nothing full lockdowns Europe, pure populism politicians. btw even Sweden soft lockdown like Denmark, apply Denmarks corona death curve Sweden Sweden would still many times deaths per capita. explain that? many important factors Sweden worse rest Scandinavia, harsher restrictions wouldve barely helped. restrictions Sweden extremely effective implemented way late. went doctor's office June July receptionist checking casually put mask walked up. two ladies sitting maybe two feet never put on. spike cases Sweden began earnest four weeks ago. Deaths low starting pickup. Sweden highest daily death rate (7) months. We'll surely see rise next weeks.

Just weeks ago, heard everyone Sweden reached level herd immunity. cases quadrupled.

What country want look at? Today, UK reporting ~200 deaths day. One month ago, reporting single digits. ~400 deaths day 3 weeks.

France reported 300 deaths today, quadrupling rate month ago. month now, ~700/day.

Contrary comment, every major European country shows pattern - every one. well exactly call disinformation see hard data discussed polite calm manner, opposed calling people names? anger issues? Depends country, sure. I’m at, compliance high. understand Midwest completely different beast, unfortunately heart raced second reading words “Biden tests”  make sure you’re safe recklessness? 

My roommate without health insurance insists going bars, gyms, bowling night stating they’re safe possible. Meanwhile stay home, order curbside takeout, socialize outdoors.

I’ve accepted it’s matter time covid shows house.  Nah, Mozambique. 2 chest, one head case bullet proof vest on. That’s necessarily works. always disappear sub deaths start coming. ignore now. Yo you’re sooo can’t tell joke you’re serious.. lag! Sturgis motorcycle rally? bad one contact tracing large majority patients genomic sequencing link many cases states around SD caused event. Could hundreds thousand biotech February 175 people traced 20,000 cases end August. Another example would aggressive South Korean gov't handled Daegu outbreak, started famous Patient 31, singlehandedly started huge community cluster Daegu. Church crazies exist Bible Belt, alive well Korea due swift action gov't individuals, transmission slowed manageable totals. 

When speak friends South East Asia, especially Thailand Vietnam used teach English tell eat time even go clubs bars mask-free, knowing sacrificed early on, understand must feel sense pride there. friend Vietnam actually started manufacturing cloth masks (already made clothing) back January sent back family friends Canada. worried told would much worse Canada western nations, largely inaction governments one believed him. listed things Vietnam government enacted everyone followed measures month two (basically draconian lockdown like Melbourne) things would get back normal.

To sum up, long road ahead. also Seattle. Feels really good part sane community honestly.  Almost like takes people time end hospital getting sick. Unfortunately, point reaching 200 deaths day probably baked in, even lock today... big increases cases may related lot testing done opposed start panademic people don’t want get vaccine get immunity old fashioned way contracting virus. kills them, oh well made choice sucks them.

Utah screwed.

For anyone reading unfamiliar Utah culture, people state make big big deal family gatherings. families big.

I saw family reunions city parks drove Utah July. Thirty plus gathering gazebo half-hearted attempts mask wearing (others even bothering). sunny. Outdoors. lovely breeze.

What happens million-plus Utahns say ""family first"" pack inside family gatherings Thanksgiving Christmas anyway? 

Sigh/quiet sob

I'm glad currently live Utah. going terrible fall/winter, fear. Unless one vaccines get approved first. CDC bell like NYSE? get one friend UK tested positive getting Covid March. happening place. feel like lot people going get ill resolved course are. :) They're hard overlook follow Swiss politics while. sips coffee Singapore watching world go mad left tolerant disabilities!   Rising cases bad thing. amount tests administered effect number people infected, shows prevalent virus community.

If tests positive cases rising, that's bad thing. virus control spreading.

If tests positive cases stay relatively low, that's good thing. means spread virus control. I'd agree points nicotine gum *is* bullshit. let make buy products prolong addiction, quit. clear could considered nonsense, political way even extreme. Wow, troughs really high well. cannot good. Nah, first earthquake, whats happening tsunami. definitely two minor falls. Thank you! Curfews useless. make sense.

It's good see protests though...shows people aware. favorite comments. democratic hoax, trump wins they'll drop totally lost Biden wins they'll drop already one. love theory assumes United States country world trouble dealing covid. lady hair literally going Halloween party; guessed it, masks!

And I’m sure it’ll spill 2021 Sounds great - it’s wonderful hear China definitely open, repressive dictatorship censors entire populace lies international community essentially everything totally thing past. referring largest anti war protests history bush skirting constitution declare war without vote? Un fucking real. going recover country? really hope less serious think. tool. closed many businesses March necessary. I'd leave N95 mask got home start pandemic, surface transmission still big question, mainly avoid contaminating hands could get chance thoroughly wash them. Even pandemic I've impressed South Korea. tiny little country yet somehow managed export culture US tune billions dollars per year. high school teacher kids love K-pop.

Theres journalists surely that’d news no? keep breathing. You’ll get it. 
Lmao yeah it’s getting crazy time vaccine half damn country already Every generation thinks new generations.  ok.  live Seattle everyone wears mask. It’s political here, everyone it. Nothing like bit psychological torture. Everyone loves guess. Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan. actually getting crazy. obviously verrrrrry called herd immunity strategy (non vaccine) holy shit don’t lock exponential growth going crazy pretty much america general, better living antarctica. correct Italians ceded control money supply ECB went euro, wrong think ECB can't help here. That's unbelievable. Thanks bit interesting information.  hurt you? Yeah, would terrible weren't!

There's simple calculation produces (very) conservative death estimate I've running since May.

Take current active cases region, country, whatever, multiply overall fatality % concluded cases.

Add total number deaths region.

This produces estimate current deaths + estimate many die current cases. 

This creates estimate predicted total current cases concluded new cases added all. meant conservative. expect numbers larger.

With said, numbers US yesterday. 

228,276 deaths + 
2,777,671 active cases * 4% = 
228,276 + 111,107 = **339,383** expected deaths.

#**339,383** expected deaths.

If additional cases.

And today added **81,210** more.

Remember death prediction expecting new cases, ***just*** expected total deaths current fatalities active cases already have.

Holy shit. That. Trump's arrogance gets us.

Repeating calculation new numbers give us this.

229,284 deaths + 
2,819,508 active cases * 4% = 
229,284 + 112,780 = **342,064** expected deaths. 

#**342,064** expected deaths. 

That's **2,681** deaths one day new cases.

Remember purpose calculation provide conservative estimate total amount deaths. Take number consideration realize **6x number US soldiers lost entire Vietnam War**.

Think every time Trump smirks says ""it's going away, rounded corner."" 

Realize every day continues, many thousands people going add death count. 

Every day wear masks, every day infection count rises, every day pretend ""turning corner"", run calculation see look forward to. 

Source figures: 
Total projected deaths = 
current deaths + (overall death% * # active cases) guy thread made powerful counter argument doesn’t feel like it. We’re dealing sorts people view lack empathy badge honor. don’t know argument could use change sociopath’s mind. Repeat me: billionaires make money stock market money companies actually make. Bezos worth 200B hard workers work crazy overvalued bubble stock market. truly value net worth based workers productivity, worth 20x less. Winter coming. Yeah thousands hundreds thousands foreigners still working China too? 1990 anymore China open actually research spreading ass ignorant opinions Lol 300? rookie numbers.

I say It’s nobody’s responsibility protect you, except own. terrified virus 99.8% recovery rate, stay home ruin economic situation. don’t expect everyone else cater you. No. old. hear lot El Paso news lately. Care give context? im sure states need funding right now, 1.5-2 TRILLION dollar bill sitting congress everyone fighting last 3 months. Sounds like something Donald Hump would anger Democrogs. Aussies, aside whingers, managed well. understand hard boarders genuinely want prevent spread. many lockdowns takes US #1 Sure felt like lol. Remember two months ago said 600 red line could trigger new restrictions?

Pepperage farms remembers... yes, do. wow, follow orders.

If Cigna insurance carrier, I'd recommend contacting directly questions coverage.

Per website:

**COVID-19 diagnostic visits:** Cigna waiving out-of-pocket costs COVID-19 visits in-network providers, whether provider’s office, urgent care center, emergency room, via virtual care, October 31, 2020.

Leftists incapable self assessment reflection. Asymptomatic kids apparently rare. pretty soon. point really wonder point governance make sure people get want, majority folks busy covering covid cases, _do people Utah want covid?!_ course Trump. absolutely politicized masks, refused long time set example wearing masks. spent lot time actively campaigning masks. know say assumptions. wear mask according cdc guidelines listen word Trump spews. low standard trying compare officials understand this. put mask on. Whichever way lean, left right, put mask on. People dying every day something actually change. 

I wish people would unite stop making political. No, but.... grown area like that, I've noticed not-bumpkins gtfo. Hell, that's every podunk town kid's dream, escape, go somewhere interesting, someplace there's stuff things *happen*.

That's compounded fact jobs places nil, often internet crap can't even freelance work remotely. there's massive brain drain. Many kids leave do, return. choose defund education systems, made bed, sleeping gets change minds good, expect fall sword ignorance Seattle, pretty sure say contact someone tested positive get test scheduled within days.  hope gf well today! causing insane amount harm agreeing numbers? It’s OK differing opinions things!! keep wear mask need completely wrong accusation.

I take study worth grain salt doesn’t mean shit grand scheme things. Duh? happens foods coming country COVID. Nope. didn’t say everyone supports liberal policies. agree many liberal policies. know many liberals/democrats intelligent, smart, reasonable people. Leftists that. Big difference. think significantly differnt understanding math think .65 heading winter wrong thats CDC prediction. 1.5 million rate much lower 2 million. get 500k dead herd immunity neither number, predicted ifr consistent sources. current models put us near 500k around March February well herd immunity. wear mask like I'm asked, inability outright refusal people answer questions worries me. necessarily agree anti-maskers, longer lasts I'm starting understand position. Says guy starts talking name? Boise room covid patients then? ID patients going 6+ hours out-of-state closer places? Even Spokane would closer seattle pdx. Survival rate 99.4% fully working healthcare system Take upvote get out. I'm depressed think many times headline may repeat coming weeks. spent days progressive parts state somehow extrapolates rest state, including rural conservative areas? CDC also stated states must planes functioning November 1st. don’t want explain? somebody speeding? give warning mask first time. fine mask second time. Idk there's plenty ways make people comply cops actually gave shit. long take? year it’s worth it. too. Maine, family practice doctor RUNNING CONGRESS part platform anti-mask.

Luckily, he’s going lose 25 points... Literally every business gone past week staff wearing mask around neck. Many customers without one now, they're ""tired"" Covid means over. Dude forgot /s

Dumb ass knows doctors scientists. listen experts? thought saying would see spike, sorry. laughing hysterical people really believe saying 4 weeks we're fucked convince anyone true. Guess saying that. cops anything like city's, really care masks. even wear masks. Absolutely ridiculous, expect class bullies peaked highschool badge gun? Explains maximum intelligence requirement officer, guess  See: half widconsin does. start March, like first days so, anyone paying attention coronavirus knew going catastrophic people still oblivious. People didn’t start talking much COVID social media like shortly Super Tuesday March 3rd. like again; see little discussion alarm new surge social media. folks don’t know shaping beyond tsunami (regardless COVID deniers say). Impossible say early on, downplaying seriousness situation wrong move. recommend listening research saying. 10-20 years could looking large chunk population experiencing issues resulting disease.

The point isn’t alarm. It’s take seriously. police flip lights get around live? I've pull see cop sitting busy stop sign lights less block road. surprise assume work retail. see people almost every day smug smile, waiting someone ask put mask on. said, FL Explain wearing mask improves global poverty.

You link new report published today shows people 25 countries set face devastating levels hunger coming months due fallout COVID-19 pandemic.

Pretending COVID 19 real change anything. Nothing article said caused wear masks even lockdowns. Lol...I time this. said wear mask.

You said claim 0.5% low. accused moving goalposts. 

If can't keep up. that's fine. I've stated claim numbers. I've even done math you. Yet seem think means I'm mask wearing. Get yourself. stopped reading “the left”. CBD extracts available derived hemp, cannabis (weed). Easter 2023 I'm saying reasonable assert small groups driving spread without evidence. implying school re-openings fault, that's different assertion. Look, end day, disease spread complicated, think careful make epidemiological assertions. USA governmental branch called “Parliament.” Bad statistics. N=200 nowhere enough make commentary population 100 million. get it... end next week be. agree, ways prevent diseases. non mandatory. wanna wear mask go it! That’s decision, point I’m trying make let people decide. Making mask mandatory power play virus 98-99% survival rate. Imagine government made mandatory everyone diet? many lives would save, would eliminate obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease. people would absolutely erupt chaos would happen. making exercising mandatory. cant use logic using mask helps saves lives cause really trying save lives we’d make things stated mandatory. What? Plot twist. leave work states cities mask mandates. Idaho sends overflow patients states cities. There's escape!!!!! 

I feel bad ID medical workers. Base fines percentage income. 2 big demonstrations 2 months ago ten thousands attendees. exploding uncontrollable cases. coulda thought haha. [COVID-19 detected wastewater Boston area skyrocketing.](http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm) Instead see something that's supposed prevent getting it, spreading it. dont realize reason havent gotten hasnt taken everybody people wearing masks.

This right exactly keep getting told mind business tell put masks store near me.

It choice infect me. mine. want get sick need put mask chance it. wearing mask protect dumb asses... willing me. Yet, somehow become choice... theirs. ever been. wear infinity gauntlets trying amusing? failed miserably so. definition authoritarian? ""bad""? This. defeatism even sub incredible.


To put perspective ""middle America"" seems get, radical Muslim Latinos massacring 800-1200 people everyday, sure would mandate enforce. need masks, social distancing, even local lockdowns.

We need act now. Yes late save everyone. That's point! Even save 50,000 lives, worth it. counterproductive deeply selfish PR marketing made certain people basic health measures wrong, inevitable. governed states locales, least get states locales act reasonable again. 

 
This harder emergency. Everything done enforce pigheaded stupidity. humanity last long? know school teacher sick kid get tested. School policy says teachers must quarantine close contact known positive... testing rates increase, case numbers. don’t need source genius figure out. *may* need certain level education think “huh, media reporting accurately?” don’t, I’m guy help you. I'm leave barista one highest rated coffee shops city. Owners college educated. They've getting reviews saying they're wearing masks. I'm definitely going back I'm called anytime soon. Whether matters coming random online person reddit, appreciate holding ideology treating kid way do. There's many parents kids *life goal* check take responsibility fact still made choice kid take benefits consequences. instead try *mom code* keep school, able go back seeing kid limited amount hours never actually dealing them, bonding, learning person are, also seeing they're becoming. Yeah, that's reason anybody would ever go way someone else right, there's something them? empathy directly front you. please show sources argumentation. claim goes everything I’ve seen far SCB FHM relating excess mortality. Gotta give man dues, knows crucified government still trying help... almost like always right guy job said nothing link disagrees numbers quoted severity.

If .05% people get sick 20% .05% severely ill psychopath would say trade worth wearing mask ""freedom"" something. line one saw another thread...

We're rounding corner time we're going circle miss collaboration person interaction, I'm ultimate introverted hermit. 

Talking people online same. Deep know that. 

Deep also know alternative potentially killing someone else leading death suffering family friends. 

So...I validate frustrations. However reality situation ""let's stop social distancing go back normal"" far worse little lonely 1 year. Lol Florida chief w.e openly state BANNING masks officers. remember surfaces big concern beginning. Like recommended amazon packages quarantined disinfected. washing hands wearing gloves recommendation. Later realized also spread air droplets sneezing/coughing, talking etc. 

The problem isn’t scientists changed recommendations. problem 1) masks uncomfortable people don’t want wear nature. 
2) Leadership spectrum depending state/municipality live in. Government yet united prevention front therefore hasn’t prevented anything. Yes, epidemic misinformation antibodies immunity right now. Lockdowns necessarily mean authoritarian. usage legitimate health order else would turned US.

It's like people can't even go exercise see intimate partners. mean, literally said anything going show up, would take 4-6 weeks 2. Nothing showed up, I'm sure comment even was. Anybody worked climate change extremely familiar this. Exact people. always illness family gatherings. mental illness. shows lockdowns worked. Delaying infections allowed treatment healthcare capacity catch NY. sure people think good news. America’s heartland football games homecoming. “Eat,drink,and merry tomorrow die” would take actual fine get people it. work see people pull soon get past front door, bringing usually gets met rage. wish people gave shit people. wearing one selfish af reason wear mask.

Why don’t people like hold Trump standard? constant lying downplaying far greater affect. suggested 10% population coronavirus. believe 75% people. Even idea ever coronavirus, suffering major heart changes? 

Over half billion people unknown heart issues? ""It's amazing left characterizes entire demographics stupid uneducated let accuse everyone supports liberal policies belonging echo chamber refusing think critically"" live? People Manitoba ignoring mask mandates store rules actively protesting. posts time retail workers able prevent assholes places like Canadian Tire Walmart they’ll shop without masks. they’ll go one immediately remove mask. ""human brain scales"" might think .02% close .2%, really not. That's order magnitude difference - difference 10 100, 20k deaths 200k deaths.

You arguing contagious helping case. COVID-19 serious flu lethal contagious.

Your argument kills contagious bad, confused percentages absolutes. matter virus contagious fatality rate, contagiousness affect total deaths (because people got sick, fatality rate applied larger number sick people means deaths) said outside? see inside without masks time. Came this. course it’s Utah. It’s everywhere. 4 kids hear it. Colleges same. Students (all levels) learned avoid testing avoid getting kicked campus class/activities. what's six times ""so many""? worth noting 100 million Americans genuinely believe end nigh actively pushing toward goal want meet Hug Jesus

??? Seriously? Almost third population evangelical christians? I've never heard that. Wearing mask low effort, bare minimum thing community highly infectious global pandemic. America enough people view bare minimum tyranny oppression quite proud fact reason we’ve made actual progress containing thing past 8 months. Helene care baby involved. care others circumstance. nothing nefarious intent, promise. different belief humanity begins. sperm meets egg (presumably) baby womb. oppose abortion way oppose cold blooded murder.  happen till get government cares. Germany targeted track-and-trace seeing much lower infection rate, one lander two-week lockdown? even trying make sense? First it. that. argument, mine lol.

Second, exagerating position changing it. 
Nobody mentally sane says easy way pandemic. Governs everything lower economic impact balance Covid deaths human cost measures.
That question, society talk handle anti Covid measures properly.

But saying something else, totally different, harshly downplaying covid. 
We cannot achieve ""herd immunity"". That's it.

And that's because:
1. told would literal bloodbath, blocking hospitals everyone.
2. even guaranteed since preliminary (and stress preliminary) evidences questions long lasting immunity. even guaranteed would work.

Lastly news week even Sweden, last economically big country aimed heard immunity UK, backpedaling objective. Man want jello Honestly think national mask mandate would change little. might increase mask usage slightly (maybe it’s worth even that) would require unprecedented implausible degree coercion get enough people comply. state mask mandate since April tons people simply ignore it, authorities simply consistently enforce mandate. Rise fascist lockdowns. Finally something giving hope. I’d like see comment provide recent post sentiment also please would love see sources mask wearing lmao fucking idiot Yes. Let's sacrifice young instead. cares anyway, already poor still people refuse wear mask? Unbelievable. Hows going Murica cares Fauci guy, society needs accept mitigation get rate transfer 1 going happen costs proportional benefits. 

Open up, facilitate triage get with. Seems like America bumbles one shitshow next without ever learning past. provoking, actually expect answer. Everytime someone says ""Sweden"" people quick point comparisons neighbours time death rate call failure. less grounded argument, fifth highest death rate.

But Belgium, death rate 50% higher Sweden, moment, growing much faster, excuses abound. ""their counting method comprehensive"" (so Sweden's), ""their neighbours different"", on.

This country locked heavily, hysterically fast. work. many half hearted excuses keep made them? never saw article bombastically calling Belgian reaction monumental failure way done Sweden, UK, Argentina, Spain etc Mirror non US? It’s testing people. Seriously? maybe true, it’s scary think many people infected rates increasing think heard recently epidemiologist Michael Osterholm next fall models predicting 60-70% US population infected.

This number could’ve much lower taken precautions, many idiots among us.

This whole pandemic rubbed wrong way fellow Americans. 1. detected cases far March April. 
2. use word cases Misleading title. Real Tool fans know Adam real front man. Danny Carey beast drums well. Amazing, right? Imagine medical professionals.   remember reading france yesterday? wow understand meant value bravery, occasions timidity cowardice serve better good. Oskar Schindler lick Nazi's boots years motivated greed beginning, much good good side Nazis. Fauci stay inside government long least know what's going on, help formulate kind plan implement US functioning government.... assuming functioning government coming quickly. Cross fingers. Yep Round conservatives send prison? Mask moment (no pun intended) Electro shock therapy Clockwork Orange style brainwashing? knowledge yet suggested. didnt know thanks info. Dunno. I’m guessing members certain group people USA blindly follow leader. BREDA - corona test street Breda defaced destroyed several people Saturday. Employees also verbally abused intimidated.

According Mayor Paul Depla, done ""people think corona myth."" calls intimidation, daubing vandalism sad even talk about: ""Show respect people healthcare GGD"".

GGD announces via social media addition vandalism, people also present test street cause nuisance. police informed. Germany?

You understand Germany already issuing regional lockdowns, even places comparatively better Italy, right? Victoria. Australia nothing like long strict lockdown. shut down? going freeze rent mortgages? going hand $2000 / month everyone can't work home?

That part actually sounds pretty good, yeah America setting world records one another. That's amazing. Hahahaha NYT Antivaxxer, hahahaha
Hahahaha posts sub mostly US... outside world exist?.. put mask camp, wear supermarkets museums. pcr test misused juke numbers. disgusting. Cases mean infections. love people say wearing fucking masks social distancing.

No fuck learning live it, ignoring it. posts sub US... outside world exist?.. makes jizz pants fair, stirrings COVID Asia back November, surprising Korea ran drills did. guaranteed spies people right places inform them. difference is, took seriously something right away. Christ. thought doom gloomer. got 1/2 Americans dying 2022? beginning outbreak, hoping death toll less 3 million. reaching truly apocalyptic numbers 180+ million. hyperbole?

It's going get bad. did, NZ would fucked right along us. So, show little optimism.

Good job controlling outbreaks NZ! Still hoping turn around states.  adenovirus weakened virus. virus directly injected vaccine (the vector). Covid virus SARS-COV-2, somehow, mechanisms understand, instructs body become immune SARS-COV-2. Strike iron hot, said. That’s simply true. Sputnik vaccine hyped “approval”... conduct phase 3 trial. Even completely approved, general availability would possible stage. Please don’t fearmonger. Yeah, kind nice way. normal families genuinely want good people want kids part community.  last sentence. think attributing malice explained incompetence. Honest question: situation would recovery rate interesting whilst midst pandemic. me, says absolutely nothing don’t lot data like IFR, phase pandemic, number active cases such. 

Help here!

Edit: Downvoting asking question clarity makes sad. Replaced non-religious infection disease expert like Fauci. There’s reason Trump still keeps around shunned Fauci. isn’t world class doctor. deserve better. ""It's failure American culture too""

Annnnddddd crux issue. whom? one seeing response cause ass downvoted. look places saw list congestion runny nose. guess anything possible. sick last spring bad runny nose, doctor said reported symptom.  Imagine begging government like loser idea sorry knew didn’t work, thought supposed treat it, prevent Lockdown incoming nothing wrong people telling other

Sometimes. Snitching people unmasked parties dozens people? Yeah get that.

Where draw line though? half dozen people know much contact anyone else? ok? Two couples work high-contact jobs? edges fuzzy.

And know snitching would become selective. Karens would go around looking kind people like (wrong color popular one) pounce slightest infraction.

I think would like lovely world long. might surprised quickly found transgressing arbitrary rule. Teacher Utah chiming in. real. I've seen social media, heard parents say well. Yesterday, almost 2000 cases statewide, sad record state life supposedly cherished. indicator


I agree, however, there’s new method detects early coronavirus outbreaks COVID related Google searches “loss taste.” oblivious people see driving night, highway, headlights off. Yeah, know. obvious explanation general gave circumstances. South Korea, woman infected 38 others sitting AC vent Starbucks. COVID-19 airborne. Ppl dine idiots. Wow thought US evil world country hard time covid ?? No, general public's healthcare raised 3 times higher american wages last 30 years. would rather live repercussions downsizing repercussions getting COVID, personally. 

I feel parents options hard choices made I'm hoping works best kids growing this. They’re chemistry company first foremost Yes mostly stay open usa. welcome link government page showing mandate restaurants near close. Go on. really easy copy paste. ..............it's like months.  NYC Seattle? hell Cuomo reopen casinos?

That's quite similar asian parent stereotype? Except many kids thing.... literally proved point person replied to. Damn that’s rough. economically punishes people right thing 10% active cases? AKA still infected? thought obvious article? People proudly wear masks really piss off. Even think help inflict upon everyone else. Even decreases chance spread 1% amount people come contact daily makes worth little bit discomfort worth ten times over. chinese bot would assume better english react passiv aggressive lebowski quote. opinion... idea earn money kind posts would appreciate lf could share (doesn matter lf cia, chinese, Russian hell even north korea - lf get money it... would even make nice spot picture xi, kim, Putin whoever) hate people act like they're one world mentally struggling try blame literally everyone Clearly, people cleaning groceries think much effort attention. long harm anyone, place tell someone careful?

Seeing much increase covid cases EU even wanna think happen USA..

What's ""invisible accordion"" reference to? *Curb Enthusiasm*. problem ban household mixing (and social meetings private general) likely measure ignored difficult police. Therefore, numbers rising. Since winter coming gets darker earlier every passing day, people increasingly congregating inside.  literally know possible range long-term effects COVID younger people is. cannot definitively say young healthy people don’t worry long-term effects. It’s difficult find mild asymptomatic cases resulted lung damage heart problems. There's reason US extreme measures China took -- blocking highways infected cities, aggressive contact tracing, kidnapping infected people, welding doors shut -- measures work, **they work**, authoritarian tastes. That's China able mostly defeat virus, making tradeoff freedom/liberty/whatever.

That's endorse did, lay plain fact table entirely possible crush virus zero regard human rights. China need fake numbers, chose things far worse faking numbers to. Two choices

1) it

2) 1 million dead Nice whataboutism literally talking Fauci recommending making law. positivity rate got tested. That’s obviously going higher rate entire population. followed closely. absolutely correct. We’ll burned stake soon. Nobody knows everything including him. also said young healthy could go cruises. wonder schools feel this? parents kids play sports pandemic worried getting Covid lol? Well, it’s obviously maximum capacity. get staff might feel tired since toes since March. 

Here another, equally true story ICU situation Uppsala: Chief physician Uppsala: [Chief physician Uppsala: ICU pressure cannot compared version: less civilized soul inside wants start pummeling every person see public without mask. phenomenal adherence scientific advisement, 70% people wearing masks, 30% complete loser dipshits fuck us. Covid Well, stating excess mortality New Zealand news anyone.

Sweden somehow became symbol lot anti-lockdown crowd spring (in spite people limiting daily life higher degree lot US states, example). debate since deteriorated anti-lockdown crowd gloating whenever Sweden well, pro-lockdown crowd gloating whenever Sweden badly.

It really make sense, agree. examples countries less restrictions better Sweden, examples countries restrictions worse. tendency goes ways, articles forum bashing Sweden every thing done past 8 months abundant well.

This article states facts, however, see problem that. US death rate currently 2.7%. Sorry. confusing death ratio death rate. article linked ratio different math death rate. Death rate actually covered link. 

Google CDC Weekly death rate want get even bothered. actual CDC death rate varies sometimes high 4% week  agree probably suffer consequences. Misspelling “Idiocracy” undercuts point somewhat. Exactly, summer cases bring outside... mistake. closed almost entire country soon around 16 cases day first wave light... summer hit everyone hated government opened fucked up. they're wearing masks mandate wont much. long bars restaurants open nothing gonna change close flights China. blocked travel Chinese citizens flying US. Non-chinese citizens (such tourists folks traveling business) still able freely travel China US iffy pay out. girl work said waited results still gotten paid last week One thing, I'm human garbage right now. early 2020? Afterall think wearing mask important now, surely doubly important first months. Imagine damage walking around first 3 5 months 2020 (depending level stooge are) spreading disease community. done much damage I. ilk would've diligent research compliance would much different situation (if disregard political operatives). Yet trying put genie back bottle, screaming everyone realizes damage done, it. Human garbage, kept head down, told, held approved opinions approved times told shut up, will. Intellectual property rights. That's name game pharmaceuticals this. compared Scandinavian countries Sweden done badly. geography Scandinavia different rest Europe comparisons mean little. daily new cases, yes, active cases entire country upward staircase shape throughout bursts. US whole never achieved actual downward trend total active cases entire time. mean doctors wages? paid compared western societies that's everyone wants doctors usa. wasnt new facts though, flat lied wouldnt rush ppe. knew damm well would worked control community spread. SARS? Amazing stock markets uneffected Im sad say read reports Swedish officials even hospital staff spinning stats. way crush virus lockdown hard continue locking hard whenever new cases pop up.

Nope. wide scale, least. lock hard, restrict travel country test come in. cases slip result outbreak targeted small localized quarantines. working New Zealand, China, Vietnam. Taiwan hasn’t even cases slip long last checked. I've never less happy telling people ""I told so"" since February. Telling opinion poverty killing based misinformation avoided following proper policies. didn’t get booster 63. someone explain means me? Equivalent 230,000 cases US--and Netherlands reported 167,000 US equivalent cases, Czech Republic US equivalent 238,000 cases drumph bad, fauci good heh heh I’m confused comment, saying risk killing thousands people save thousands people dying? daughter's school district facebook page constantly debates useless mask mandate ""live fear""

That's ironic considering America governed fear. I'm sure ever going happen. lot people alter behavior see piles dead bodies. Clearly lot parents thread. many people afford live one income means kids school parents pay childcare. Childcare ridiculously expensive. parents know sent kids back schools opened work full time struggling balance work/finances kids home. Gotta love reddit mom hate. new evidence emerges, recommendations change. People change amd improve, except Trump (he's stubborn toddler). Jesus chris France, it’s time actually something spreading misinformation right now.  exactly I'm saying big deal, I'm saying outcomes among hospitalized covid patients representative general population, much less reddit demographics, expect infected. Agreed. think time even among medical establishment common belief masks little prevent transmission viral infections. actually know better now.

I'm suspicious even rate infection might huge impact value masking. C19 happens sweet spot masks actually make difference. agenda scientific consensus. think qualified assess clearly letting biases gear find things want hear. think WANT things still dangerous? NO. that's reality. post removed ""You contribute high-quality information"".

Funny, Lars Wilderäng well known Sweden, written sixteen fiction, novels fact books, one read blogs Sweden, always good data sources (even line everyone...). time official data Statistics Sweden (SCB) links check them, English.

That's viruses work goal returning normal, I’m bare minimum putting security theater.

Yes, moron, that's nothing new Reddit mostly made morons. entire history filled coronavirus panic, like mentally unstable.

Please wear tinfoil hat, flat earther, people streets could identify idiots isolate society. CDC covid survival rate 19 y.o.s under: 99.997%

Bear mind that's develop covid, factor chances a) catching corona, b) developing covid it. survival rate even higher that

Oh, 50s 99.98% Colleges re-opening, weather becoming cooler. upper Midwest Sturgis Rally hope don’t get point it’s easier start counting people still alive. Exactly. mean either group activities statistically meaningful way.

Example: Neither group differed often went jello wrestling paragliding.  Man, begin. 90% workforce work home. allowed day maximum 1hr exercise. allowed go food shopping day, one person per household. supermarkets, medical centres, pharmacy’s select stores allowed open, everything else shut. Take away restaurants. allowed 5kms home unless valid reason like caring someone, medical attention. schools online learning. Mandatory mask wearing anytime you’re outside, unless actively exercising. essential worker couldn’t work home, obtain hold workers permit prove it. We’ve levels restrictions since May/June (I think, time kind gone wonky). 

Yeah, government paid people stay home couldn’t work home weren’t essential worker scheme called JobKeeper. decent amount money too, mate making JobKeeper normal job (though weren’t taking tax it). Raised Mormon, 1 5, confirm. really explains former marriage. I’m North Carolina saw one police departments post Twitter enforcing mask laws. here. Texas scary place right G614 D146G, maybe both. March towards fascism? disagree premise question. republican party trying abolish elections install authoritarian state. pressed though, I'd say ultra-nationalistic nature people concerning. think proud country without claiming nations better ours.

I religious values. agree white supremacists either. What’s say? don’t think it’s conservative value party platform. think Trump racist, works bring worst people, certainly representative views.

Or grift. haven’t seen politician recently accused convicted taking bribes. think, general, laws governing campaign contributions need reformed. Corporations aren’t people though donating cash politician’s campaigns form free speech, easy corrupt current system pay legislation.

We used say democratic party Tax Spend party. republicans become Debt Spend party. guess keep waiting elected officials show restraint. alternative vote someone know going raise taxes increase government spending.

I haven’t voted yet, voting Biden year. I'm honestly glad go poorly could have. Looking around U.S. rest world, though, think us woods yet, none us know many people could saved stricter safety measures place. Jet boots understand that. illogical believe something know there's evidence for. 

So choosing knowingly illogical claiming believe science again, illogical.

It's one thing holes Scientific Theory.

It's another say, ""I believe scientific theory, think there's cosmic diety holes, despite illogical despite much bigger hole he's involved."" Maybeee third wave people understand seriousness situation.

Or not. misquoted. Taken context. distorted almost everything I've said.

Not one bit.

/u/barge_gee said ""So let couple million die, faster better, get with?""

[You ""Sorta, ya. virus. going away.""

You advocated letting people die *you* inconvenienced more. think scenario though, lockdown place protect hospital workers. covid starts spreading treat anyone, experienced older staff doctors would died lost critical resources far longer lockdown. hard say correct response would be, perhaps partial lockdown treatment slower stopped entirely? “Placebo.”  need rude. Lots people paying attention scientific process first time prior understanding. It’s people think wrong makes incompetent person. fucking asshat, means new data changed factual determination. disposables, plain immediate view.

The whole article pretty interesting read actually. ""After pausing safety concerns."" Information changed, part scientific method. wear fucking mask stfu. load unmitigated bullshit. We’re testing, we’re contact tracing, every school opened subsequently closed due outbreak, CDC admitted children even get disease.. we’re still pretty sure school fine. education important.

While false positive rate remains area continued examination, preliminary studies show test’s false positive rate far less De Klerk claims. recent article British medical publication Lancet Respiratory Medicine, said estimates U.K. place false positive rate 0.8 4% range, false negatives could run high 33%.

As virus causes COVID-19, scientists universally agree novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, strain influenza.

While death rate COVID-19 remains uncertain, reported, evidence suggests higher seasonal influenza.

In De Klerk’s country, Netherlands, 6,800 deaths attributed COVID-19 far year, compared 2,900 due flu pneumonia 2018-19.

In U.S., COVID-19 caused 220,000 deaths, worst flu season past decade killed estimated 61,000 people 2017-18, we’ve reported. fact, COVID-19 far killed people U.S. past five flu seasons combined, hundreds die ""Middle school homecoming"" even compute Canadian brain. Although make niece cry said kindergarten ""graduation"" laughed thought cute little joke. no, actually gowns mortarboards on. weird. *My* kindergarten ""graduation"" basically consisted teacher saying, ""Okay, little monsters, get lost, try break damn necks summer. Scram!"" Ya fuck em right?
They poor want die right. true American patriot knows people die every large business continue record breaking profits. people matter news watch reporting it?

Out sight, mind! Czechia equivalent 500k cases per day US rapture? Making America Germy That's US shut interstate personal travel. could required federal pre-approval able purchase plane/train/bus ticket. Nah, rounding corner. /s mom terrified us mailed us big box masks. god. Hard believe. remember exactly feels like was....2018? Tsunami engaged Winter coming. Pffft!

I'm sure I'd call ""Art installation"" either way, definitely paints picture need see Easter 2077 deaths lagging behind. We've numerous times.

Amazing still said 7-8-9 months thing People dropping dead walking public government welding apartment buildings doors shut. Also dumping dirt rock roads block anyone leaving Wuhan. Savage remember telling colleague cases started appear NY TX, believe, right afterwards, well truly fucked. laughed said big deal. Cake, please. That’s always part worries, people prevent still contracted. Sending positive vibes guys’ way! Don’t fight collective. right, wrong. mostly agree that, amend case literally ain't bad *may* seem

Clarifying possibly ambiguous headline still ain't downplaying issue, simply clarifying what's actually happening avoid people running wild it. think people wanted believe chance things would get control. all, memory ebola still fresh people's minds, time, followed similar trajectory. course, ebola spread body fluids, never going infectious. Similar zika. like coronavirus, *was* hyped people thought it'd worst thing ever, yet came went.

Humans also prefer believing status quo change, boiling frog apt metaphor— adapt changing situations pretending situation changed. Yeah, virus may spreading, things *really* changed, they? thousand people infected *worldwide!* 

Except thousand people USA. thousand people state. thousand people county. thousand people town. status quo eviscerated one deny it, everyone pines come back. That's actually extremist regimes rise: something upsets status quo offer bring back. Humans crave stability strongly give blank check please.

There's quote went something like ""Before pandemic, everything look alarmist. pandemic, everything we've done seem inadequate."" That's gist. alarmist wasn't, took propaganda make alarmist again. we're suffering it. Yeah, back news presenting COVID plague. shocked Tom Hanks got it, thought guy toast. recovered without issues. recovered without issues. I've realized we've bamboozled thinking virus lot worse really is. Chomsky said something 70s Vietnam war first time history nation's citizens exposed war crimes learned nobody cared. even cover things up? change anything. fucked That's good question one much disagreement. 5000 IU fact far FDA recommended amount sources say good, point. tested last year low (22). 5000 IU recommended doctor, trust entirely. physical next month anticipate reduction daily Vitamin D3 intake blood work.

There's extensive best comment read earlier today someone explaining situation there. Among many things mentioned government 1000 people government family friends family, said close falling soviet style government. Complete shit show. Ah yes, 45 years ago early 2020 really focused dealing initial spread overwhelm resources.

I'm glad there's hope, really know sure. am. population generally abide advice given government. Theres anti-science politicising pandemic health guidelines here. Due really need enforce anything strictly elsewhere, lot people follow guidelines. 

Masks required public transportation, bus, metro, flights.
Also generally people live spread avoid people part. Going outside staying many meters apart anyone feasible people dont walk dense city centers (and even rather scarce compared dense populations like seen big US cities).

Personally would like see consequences dont care, like $6000 $7000 fine so. However accept rules worked people generally know shit domain (medicine), think theres need either. Personally stopped social activities closest people, know many well (willingly). 

Norway incredibly well rigged handle something like though, welfare compensation actual job safety (no 2 weeks here, like 3 months) combined free health care people abiding government health guidelines, things went far better feared started obsessing january. Ah, Xmas Eve. Another pointless day accomplish nothing.

Still sound particularly pleasant. must look incredibly silly. learnt something new China's mass testing program yesterday. Besides 10 person per group batch PCR testing used Qingdao there's actually different type batch testing also used China antibody/antigen test (aka rapid test) called ""progressive batch testing"".

If taken one rapid test know sort like pregnancy test put drop sample onto test stripe, add buffer solution observe either 2 3 lines appear.

In progressive batch testing there's instead larger amount test solution test tube. person running test drop test sample tube observe liquid change colour. person positive. liquid change colour drop another sample test tube observe colour test tube ten samples. start fresh test kit test another 10 people. mean said ""masks"" definitely went somewhere like store something exposed out.  I’m sorry facts scare much. Would prefer lied like child? president pretending like it’s families across US continue suffer. Go ahead belittle suffering sad political whining. I’m real sorry people suffering dying makes gloomy, perhaps it’s hope you’re still human. Yeah, they’re approaching summer, winter, that’s meant. mean point, living one countries firmly control, i'd feel like Europe US lost collective minds...

They talking US one hundred cases! Also, recommending masks... yelling speaker future.. fools, wear mask! South Dakota. Well 6 months ago I'd say probably many gatherings since I've come expect normal looking Times Square, packed wall wall  paranoid mean people *don't* want kill you... might. like crying seen. take moment compose yourself. say almost given actual daily cases back April likely 150k+, definitely seems like start something pretty bad. government undercounting purpose didn’t. You’re lying something must gone wrong. people see get covid days don’t socially distance don’t wear masks. Yup, it’s prevalent country, rural urban alike. means priming rapid overwhelming spread everywhere cold weathers forces us indoors months.

This exactly Fauci warned us pleaded country get daily cases 10,000 entering fall. watched France. watched Lombardy pretty closely, Spain London. think Spain probably interesting bunch. got hit pretty hard Spring getting hit again.

Spain serology study shows data May 11th: . Take look regional breakdown near end. 

The big population center, Madrid region 11.5% back then. think good litmus test. region 68k cases back 290k, 2.4% region. 2:1 ration undiagnosed:diagnosed cases puts almost perfectly 20%.

More interesting ask kicking now, cases flat four consecutive months April August. think see Apple Mobility Data July: also anti mask protests, people partying Canary Islands, on. 

Again paid much attention France, Madrid, human behavior. 12% serology barrier all. Clearly herd immunity point see yet.  Well, another way. Hospice care COVID patients 75 (the vast majority hospitalizations). 1 simple policy shit could get 100 times worse hospitals still wouldn’t get overrun. cost? old sickly people going die soon something else anyway die COVID instead?

But yeah, let idiots 4 years fucked us Civil War. Iran got hit incredibly hard Spanish flu; probably famine time.

Overfilled hospitals problem. Longterm consequences organs tge problem.

How still understood that? I'd argue doubting credibility article says ""much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis"" warranted skepticism mere cherry-picking.

Here list federal mandates  


The federal government absolutely aloud pass mandates regarding public health safety, especially national issue. 


A patchwork mask laws ineffective, lead far restrictive laws travel restrictions.  back school two weeks now. NJ school district 2 cases night shift janitors two different schools. reason staying open according superintendent theoretically individuals contact teachers students attended school hours. Cherry-picking information. That's never done before! Come back actual evidence opposite. live life normal, get symptoms must report study. also report risky behavior is. (Going parties, taking public transit, etc).

I'm required anything except report symptoms get them. ask purposefully expose test strength vaccine. call well all, second waving like rest Europe constantly climbing numbers. yet hit exponential spike, that's matter time numbers keep rising. days away setting new record infections per day country. pretty egregious; claims absolutely supported extant data SARS-Cov-2 coronaviruses (SARS-Cov comes mind right top head). Stop spreading misinformation. Freedom ""much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis""

I guess wearing fucking mask shutting country down?

we also never postponed election either, stop Trump suggesting Covid run mill flu, President wants postpone election flu? one?

The people protesting masks &amp; social distancing locally, least ones spoke with, 0 understanding reinfection, potential immunosuppression, even confirmed organ damage previously-healthy-asymptomatic survivors. didn’t even know SARS-1 closest relative, &amp; survivors high rates disability even nearly 2 decades later. hell happens even relatively young healthy people multiple dances Corona-chan, round allowing worse &amp; worse cumulative organ damage, even without potential ADE long term immunosuppression?


This whole thing slow rolling trainwreck, &amp; actually even concerned virus January, spite general population trend otherwise. actually people wider community loved ones die... &amp; still think it’s hoax! Unreal.

Every scientific paper recent months concluded Covid spreads best indoor areas people socially distance wear mask. proven otherwise solid research, I'm gonna assume schools, things quoted above, responsible uptick cases happened right reopened. wouldn’t happen remote island population 5 million density 15/km^2 would it?

Damn something like someone trying sound smart you? 

I'd pray We're still stupid. Tennessee, anti-mask protest small county said wear masks week. week. Nope. Idiots gonna idiot. German hospitals filled Eastern European workers btw. even relatively low number cases unsustainable long run interrupts regular hospital work. Isnt kind life works though? children maskless scenario?  30% less chance getting one wearing mask, get it, severe would been.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm.

""LOCKDOWN FRONT DOOR""

Berlin corona collapse: capital longer track infections - police react major action

Berlin probably lost fight Corona. numbers rising rapidly despite many measures, stricter rules probably inevitable, says health senator Dilek Kalayci (SPD).

The Corona * situation Berlin critical, districts broke 200 mark 7-day incidence.
Health Senator Dilek Kalayci (SPD) announced collapse: infections longer tracked - stricter rules complete lockdown seem matter time.

Berlin - previous pandemic fight without strict lockdown probably failed Berlin. number corona cases German capital increasing continuously, soon complete lockdown largest German city. Berlin SPD health senator Dilek Kalayci suspects that.

Coronavirus Berlin: ""A lockdown stricter rules around corner""

""A lockdown stricter rules around corner,"" said, announced follow-up individual corona cases Berlin districts become impossible. reason: high number people infected.

All Berliners tested positive go quarantine home, regardless whether contact Ministry Health not. also inform possible contact persons, turn also quarantine.


Two Berlin districts among top 3 corona hotspots Germany
Two districts capital among top 3 hotspots entire republic: Neukölln (2nd place, 211.76 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) Berlin-Mitte (3rd place, 203, 87 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Bizarre: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg refused help Bundeswehr, although 13th nationwide corona list (130.47).

The Prime Minister's Conference Friday eagerly awaited. city Hamburg already decided measures: ten people two households allowed meet public private space.


Berliners demonstrate restrictions
With help Federal Police, Berlin police want ensure corona rules adhered number reproductions * falls second wave. operation last night include 1,000 officials.

For Sunday, police preparing several demonstrations political decisions Corona crisis. demo planned lunchtime (2500 participants registered) Alexanderplatz, evening (10,000, “lateral thinking” initiative) Großer Stern Tiergarten. educate us - rates? I’m thinking police incidents arise it, fanning flames civil strife. would enforce police half country revolting again? oughta go well. Gonna invent mask police? think we’ve irked little chose see connection broadness testing hospital admittance rate, engage opposite quoting scientific process.

I didn’t get meant another post “Good testing"". reason thought meant procedure done wrong something effect.

Now I’m getting means good (broad) **access** testing, turn led high(er) testing rates, including amongst asymptotic. Basically anyone could get test. 

We available Ontario summer limited lineups. rates went September could take days get appointment hours standing line outside hospital testing centres.

I believe it’s back “self-quarantine stay home two weeks, call us symptoms, especially respect breathing, worsen”. I’m certain I’m following aspect Covid. almost like Human kind social doesnt want sit inside alone year. Welcome corporation called America rich matter. better time present change policy then. would enforcing said mandate especially heated time anti-police rhetoric? seriously going jail fine every person doesn’t wear mask? America’s big place everywhere. won't, won't.

It general fact life doctors learn treating diseases become better it.

Besides, posted confirmed numbers prove claims full shit. moment, case fatality rate COVID-19 much lower first wave.

The real problem US filled anti-intellectual idiots like Trump constantly downplaying virus even hundreds thousands people dead virus isn’t deadly enough!! part kills old people pre-existing medical conditions. 

So what? Let old people die? Let's walk around masks, social distancing let die? Wtf point here? Mandating anything slippery slope.

Mandating mask usage slippery slope what?  Nut jobs made lure victims:  still know shit immunity. Theres anecdotal reports reinfections, one reinfection mean everyone going able reinfected. Saying sure impossible herd immunity virus bullshit. know yet. Either way though, going natural herd immunity approach kill ton people, definitely good plan. Definitely work help either pay bills, need health insurance, feel obligated contribute even though mental health gutter. I'm lazy, typically enjoy work lately taxing mental health. feel anxious, depressed, angry, emotions place. I'm best hang there. I'm trying strong. Lol...sure thing, Skippy. problem staffing. get people states areas without high case load. think is, need show evidence.

All people saying breaking point, never be. likely permanently remove yourself. lmao I've said previous comment, would take long actually positive effect. explain 5k higher number? Roughly 14% increase? statistical noise? Cherrypicking bias causes people die outside computer screen? One caveat: lot states districts still aren’t reporting Covid-19 cases K-12 schools. Covid Monitor, independent group, collects public media reports top official data try fill gaps. it’s certainly missing lot cases, meaning number minimum estimate.

It's covered up. Besides, safe kids, parents. bad decision may killed lot people pretty much destroyed integrity. Like, masks see people trust say big lie. taking eating conversation right next someone else might taking break. 

Wait pull mask take bites food? expecting people talk meal break. 

I'm confused think going happen. Yes people take masks eating fact talk people.  want remind everyone president, man called billionaire decades, paid less taxes make $20,000 year.

Cloth masks make six-foot rule completely would sound advice **IF** children quarantined never encounter outside world thereby unable spread people.

What tragedy commons? That's crazy :( mother immunocompromised, diabetes, pulmonary sarcoidosis, heart problems host problems since childhood gets free in-home covid tests done every weeks even though spread 5\~ months.

results come overnight available 9 want defend China, several countries found evidence covid possibly countries early last fall, even China acted early stopped things, think covid would still eventually flare elsewhere result global pandemic. mean broken clock right least twice day. Trump seems digital tho...  same. going bed couch bad me

what I'm set reminder phone every hour make point stand walk around room 5 minutes. feel better guys, we're get around bend. vaccine right around corner!

/s  It’s Federal government. states well ruled opposition party Federal government forcibly asked ease restrictions made sure cases surged people held state government responsible that. 

No doubt Federal government responding better expected really one party, one government ruling entire country since aren’t able enforce rules (like said), cases surging. remember curve flattened AZ headline sounds bad actually pretty smart efficient. Poland like 100-200 daily went full lockdown mode. everything opened anyway. Now, pretty well(although way little tests) till last month, usualy sitting sub 500 last month getting close 1000.

That fucking terrifies me. Im grocery store worker choice surrounded hundreds people per day. wear mask. vast majority customers wear wonder far go consistently less 6 ft apart. teams leader deserve? No, that's same. matter often repeated reddit everywhere. Gruesome. majority Texas GAF sadly. people hopefully protect families. feel bad essential workers.

Population density Belgium 383 people/km\^2. That's one big revelations this, much many parents *don't like kids*. would love flexibility. Reality would require quit job we'd need downsize much smaller house much less expensive area, leave kids dealing repercussions decision next decade.

People judgemental mothers want, highlighting women (and parents general) support country. kids before, really think parents raised without massive amount help? literally comeback answer boomer complaining anything: ""look well were"". extended us kids, we--all us--stopped extending next generation.

We're situation parents making luxury decision one working or. norm parents two parent income houses. Jacobson v. Massachusetts states otherwise. People really need stop saying things 'unconstitutional' case law states otherwise. government mandate vaccinations, mandate mask policies. making argument one way another, someone talking *right now*, worldometers helpful. would helpful if, along cumulative, something last week, two weeks, month, whatever.

Like right now, Europe ""worse"" US, look worldometers know that, including summer, US much worse Europe. someone who’s wife completed 4 months maternity leave, couldn’t agree more. you’ve listed required maternity leave minds moment. Usually employers provide self employed government paid whole time. welcomed sides politics conservative government actually tried increase maternity leave parents. also get taxpayer funded in-home carer 50 hours per week 6 months wife chronic illnesses make fully caring child difficult.

She’s originally America appreciates help made annoyed home country, wealthiest one world, would provide care claims can’t afford help people. believe afforded it’s made priority. We’re poor country Australia we’re certainly wealthy America still make work along government supported healthcare tertiary education etc. think lot culturally egalitarian individualistic idea change that. far right, right? know it’s bad, it’s bad Breitbart/Townhall/stormfront?

I’ll wear mask I’m going go essentials...I summer gave up. living India right now? people there? wearing masks time, social distancing etc...? could see undercount high first wave, definitely much testing increased sure he's even serious? Dude spews bullshit says he's sarcastic. Shining lights inside body, using disinfectants like bleach. What's say he's here? Redditors lmao implore ? Good question. visited late September, saw thing. Religious mask wearing - like complete compliance shops/on transport lot outdoors. None chin strap shit like UK. People generally wearing walking around restaurant/to loos.

If Italy's gone truly despair UK. Italy decent tracing system? test high risk countries arrival. mean, UK perspective, could reasonably asked? 

Other full lockdown + closed borders kinda running suppression methods? mean, IIRC UK areas banned household mixing still seen high growth.

Imagine deciding burn way out. much would love see mask mandate. late. Look governors tried ended sued worse. can't force people care. us wear masks social distance isolate best hope live see end this. [Seatbelts resisted tyranny first mandated awhile, they're accepted norm. Mandating masks would help normalize masks time. short run, it'd make lot easier private businesses cut short arguments anti-maskers claiming illegal mandate mask usage. Ah, I’ve already seen memes comments Facebook going around (by conservatives only, course) taking Covid vaccine matter what. 

Absolutely ridiculous we’ve gotten point.  America leading country Western world. Elections near. Also opinion different understand come from. interesting news potus tested negativ also different Political figures Government tested negativ. Others find news kardashian photoshopped picture. Opinions different. Fake news. Germany follows science. Bermuda One guys went high school Dr studies viruses. remember called it... said Halloween year going shit ton new cases part exactly “easy [me] say”? Damn that’s kinda sad....but guess 483 new cases NYC. 2000. Honestly might end like driving without license law. Still pretty illegal, nice enough polite enough cop (~~and white enough)~~ could probably say ""Sorry, Officer, forgot home."" Barely anyone leftist. It'd easier bump alt-right member I’m Indian. think they’re outright fudging data. relative’s friend died COVID certified death multi organ failure. pandemic response total disaster get go.

However, official numbers dictate epidemic already peaked they’re conducting 1.2 million tests per day. anti mask movement mainly exists strong marketing push. need market masks better people. Saying protects virus doesn’t work people say strong enough fight virus even catch it. Saying protects people around doesn’t work people compassion others say others stay home feel unsafe. need associate mask wearing patriotism supporting economy!

A large rallying cry wearing masks people falsely associate lockdowns closing businesses bad economy.

What done connecting wearing masks opening economy. slogan “Wear mask, open economy!” Make people feel wearing mask open business back quicker, true. wear masks, we’ll open businesses quicker! people feel comfortable going back businesses customers that’s better economy.

The prefect example Las Vegas. city allowed casinos open back bunch casinos still closed voluntarily (completely shut open limited hours)...why? customers! People scared travel, go packed casino (they half empty reality), go back out. wear masks, covid numbers fall, customers businesses open minimum capacity (often times still profitable) businesses economy actually go back closer pre-covid levels.

The general population strongly influenced marketing. That’s people new cars lot money trading away perfectly good cars little money (car commercials everywhere!) people pay double name brand buying “cheap” brand often times made EXACT ingredients. 

You depend general population right thing. need influence market towards get right thing. don’t people kill, steal, drive drunk? actively spend ton money marketing message bad things influence people act right way. Take away penalties things number murderers, robberies, accidents skyrocket people don’t care others care right thing avoid prison time financial penalties. I’m looking rates world meter right now, it’s going well So? powerful people government STILL lying masks. DJT example. That’s bigger issue. Forced closure without govt aid? doesnt seem fair. 

Right country discussion nightclubs operating fully again. willing close course govt forces close govt aid cover rents, imo seems like fair deal. current scenario. Isn’t fatality rate well 1%? So, wouldn’t 90% recovery rate actually really bad vs be, nearer 99% ? Yeah, make field hospital bed basic supplies cant make another nurse work lot stupid easily manipulated people country. exist everywhere combination poor education system, inbreeding media severely impacted United States availability function effectively. I'm sorry put us.

Edit: guess add elected officials another reason suck much ass. think it’s point doctors nurses need walk job. risk lives half people don’t care spread disease don’t feel like careful. Nice, dosent cause outbreak prision. Ya think? smh...  know proof is. 
 
You never answered question, experts disagree galaxy brain assessment? I'm sure undercounting magnitude....but IFR estimates take account. Nobody seemed care kids poor families afford school.

That something lot pro-lockdown people need understand. going school hurting poorer children most. parents can't afford buy computer. lot unable attend class school work. puts even father behind.  That’s scary think about. 😐 India tested average 1.3M per day past 3 days, positivity less 4%. 

France's positivity hitting 15%+ now. 

Calma calma. think conservatives different? Hint: they're not. least empathy seems little consistent liberals Lol people report reddit resources thing time. already blocked bot. sends bunch hotline numbers, like I’m aware exist something? It’s dumb. hey long people think they’re something. Reddit contact cows come home, I’m still me. government stepping make free anytime want get tested. either reimburse Costco (ideally) customer. going get worse winter, already is..... argument there. Covid become virulent deadly....because terrible job nation slowing spread virus way. may make improvements treatment winter...but feasible improve death rate gets worse. US chosen adapt rather contain virus. I’m expecting deal situation pretty much widely vaccinated, would imagine sometime around spring. obviously don’t know areas free drive thru tests AZ. would another option people Costco doesn’t don’t see problem it. One year creative things possibly reading feel like rather might bad thing all.

Seriously, country managed lower drastically cases without lockdown ?
Note schools closed atm holiday.  servers protected. servers direct contact massless guest tables. 

Stop eating family Czech Republic says wanted follow Swedish model - open everything. working well them. new information, said conserving supplies medical teams.

If religiously defend someone like they're saying moment, can't hide behind mantle science. Parenting work. going well Sweden anymore. online teaching crap. Teachers feel like talking wall, students trouble focusing. reserved last resort Definitely part imo. need mandate things people follow guidelines naturally Social media... fact call ‘theory’ instead scientific fact tells can’t reasoned shows badly American education system failed you. You’ve chosen reject science factual evidence, there’s correcting level willful ignorance. 

It’s simple fact social distance wear masks correctly transmission rate virus would much lower. Also there’s evidence antibodies last months you’re reinfected (like flu except virus worse). 

Also...uh...airborne stds aren’t thing. please don’t mind go relay wonderful nugget Twitter lmfao East. includes (but limited to) mask mandate. Right around rhe drain. plenty them, they’re hiding inside. ones you’re noticing subject pretty heavy selection bias.  protests people close business evening going receive government aid, also completely unfair close businesses night everything else open day.  want woman doctor gives shit. suck Burden proof accuser, defendant.

Now, basis claim? rational it, ever factual research spurting lies right straight butt regurgitating mass media propaganda without critical thinking?

So far, seen anyone sub bringing ""China numbers fake!"" argument factual approach correct it, opposite happens basically time (factual data tends show Chinese numbers correct). think it’s get downvoted everywhere else. don’t get it. 

So many Asian countries done stellar handling virus resumed normal functioning society barely hear them

Sweden’s death rates rivaled worst world get numerous updates day Low obesity significant factor considered teachers parents grandparents generally school aged? complex approach experience similar outbreaks would say. Agressive local quarantine protocols, good testing, track trace... course measures would possible west privacy personal liberties orientation.
Masks part puzzle silver bullet stop everything. doesnt work way. Czech republic went 500 cases day 15k month, even mandatory masks. conclusion is, matter Political Party support, negativ test someone good news.

Countries tend take good care political elites. news Germany's Merkel, Korea's Moon, Italy's Conte, on, affected covid. politician gets tested positive, news. I've seen Reddit swedes say people follow social distancing without needing mandated. Governments need mandate shit populace follows guidelines. surprise well educated, socially aware, spread Scandinavia well Unfortunately, hydroxychloroquine become partisan issue falsehoods spouted sides. least one study (involving Surgisphere) fraud Lancet apologized publishing it. studies poorly designed raising questions whether study designers purposefully looking pre-determined outcome (some showing positive results others negative). Notably, one study UK gave HCQ doses excess 2,000 milligrams patients, outright toxic (the Gates study used 400mg).

Even Gates study design issues. gave HCQ patients hospitalized. HCQ anti-viral would useful given within day two initial infection (if value all). time someone sick enough hospitalized way late anti-viral drugs like HCQ use.

Just think HCQ used prior Covid... People travelling malaria infested regions asked start taking HCQ *BEFORE* even travelled.

Perhaps difficult anti-viral study gives doses super early due messed testing regimes are. Even HCQ useful early interventions vanishing small number people get COVID ever get test results back week they've infected. would start giving HCQ prophylactic measure people day get tested EVEN test results known properly test it.

I find interesting Gates study found significant side-effect taking HCQ. claims HCQ increased mortality (like UK study giving toxic small numerical excess cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) difference incidence new major cardiac arrhythmia among patients received hydroxychloroquine.*

The claims negative HCQ side-effects (which NIH even list web site) clearly bogus. simple fact MILLIONS people taking HCQ decades prior 2019 without recently reported side effects speaks volumes. HCQ side effects listed medical literature prior 2020 surrounding rashes skin conditions. sudden told people die taking HCQ. Nothing published back negative side effect claims.

This say HCQ wonder drug. point drug become religious litmus test led creation host biased studies.

In short, still know truth. far know - fines. problem control, check it. Also many problems imo, idk manage papers quarantine. need get money company paper local Health ministry otherwise money get fired. chaotic imo. must really bad communicate like this. every parent cut teaching home motivated kids seem able learn rules kinds games, therefore read strategize.

What, then, propose non-motivated kids? one year simply going make big difference kids learning.

And lasts one year? Nah, stupid enough get killed soon. Well, could potentially waste lot water. Democratic governor issued mask mandate back second wave rose lockdown ended. Many conservative areas state refused comply, acting reservoirs, cold fall weather set skyrocketed even areas excellent compliance.

I fear bellwether nation traditional flu season kicks high gear. Add stupidity tax. Also make sure include section notes wearing mask protect chin (wearing nose) count. full lockdown again? work delays inevitable restrictions lifted. There's stopping wave till people get immunity. places hard hit summer prior seeing far less cases right now, even shut california seeing cases open Florida right now, Arizona also pretty well, virus slow spread enough % population. world nearly simple straightforward ""progressive = good""

Reddit seems think so, bizarre. DeWine really needs introduce enforced mask mandate penalties. I’m sick listening nothing beg every Tuesday Thursday press conference. Businesses require least employees wear mask shut down. Individuals given large fines. 

We public health emergency... things need done everyone like. You’ve asked kindly, DeWine, we’re rapidly going downhill. seem know right thing is... it. Come Amurica reach 100k new daily cases. India failed America succed.



Also sad situation going downhill everywhere world even us Europeans going worst second wave ever people losing jobs hope. Yeah...I wish done same. Currently trying work butt hopefully move maybe leave country eventually. us nice many places really want explore japanese. I'm far gone done stuff here. right internet sucks, man that's disservice everyone stay way. wonder shits way Eh, large Mormon families knew growing every single child focusing school work almost played least one instrument. Yeah fuck lot kids usually pretty smart. assume talking state ur tourism still open point none actual ""shut down"". businesses actually close. Home depot, lowes, every restaurant, even repair shops, got consider ""essential"". never enforced national curfew never enforced stay home mandate. NEVER SHUT DOWN. important people like think economy poorly ""because shut downs"". that's why. never shut down. there's pandemic *didn't* shut everyone getting sick dying. want see actual shut is, look new Zealand did. Stop blaming state economy shut never happened. economy poorly precisely shut down. Even would want? Literally everything open. Restaurants poorly shut down. They're poorly margins already razor thin and, believe not, people smart enough go restaurants pandemic course they're going poorly fewer people going restaurants already barely making money best times. want know would solve this? actual shut down. comment praying. reply comment praying work. reply comment praying makes feel comfortable.

People really stupid mass suicides. guess really believe life better death, helping world spreading COVID-19. local backlash much bigger effective.

Edit: reply comment... Son, retarded. That's works. New Zealand isolated island like 5 people. dumb comparison. fucked lmao

From saw starting crack bars situation Paris. (Bars supposed closed zones curfew like paris, restaurants could stay open. bars said fuck started serve peanuts beers stay open.)

School starting week, we'll see goes. issue lies mefirst entitled culture ""individualism"" we've built. dig people willing wear mask eventually always always get ""well care people"" emotions must super tough deal with, definitely. Maybe consider talking professional couple help get tools cope emotional rollercoaster hand. People bullied going outside reddit thing say. new tumblr. Condoms actually stop airborne STDs guy finishes girl’s mouth. Right, sounds like 10% don’t recover that’s great. Give cops commission. enforcement problems begone Went doctor's office yesterday mask 3 5 staff equipped freedom dying ventilator survive knows kind long-term damage could mask rules different city. Calgary mandate anywhere indoors, soon leave Calgary mandate there. think we're agreement here, least principle. Large gatherings likely responsible recent uptick, small ones. guess would work kept kids away adults, something like Lord Flies Battle Royale situation. virus nothing humanity whole. relatively (we're talking millions) us survive. we'll either come less regard vulnerable. there's lot money riding less. need make everything one year. 

They actually do. least state, limit long teachers stay subject. 30 kids classroom, time give child extra attention. either learn fail. child fails either math reading, fail whole year. rule kindergarten - 8th grade. means repeat whole year, even subjects pass. Older houses like mine already getting cold without heating. though. difference collective societies individualist societies. impossible, people want inconvenience save people. Fuck r/nonewnormal  Sweden. second wave coming us too, albeit somewhat later rest Europe. Whether confirms refutes Sweden's strategy know anyore, goal posts changed many times since march.

But entire story calls humility sides lockdown fence believe. social distance even without pandemic .....  mandate going get anyone else wear one? enforcement said mandate penalties offenders 
? Projection daily deaths UK ""When middle outbreak wearing mask might make people feel little bit better, might even block droplet, providing perfect protection people think is.""

America? Why???  virus spreads. People think family safe. It’s frustrating people can’t comprehend basic facts personal ties. Like pro lockdown not, that’s safe situation. - currently around 3% tested positive worst regions
- want go work need negative test, otherwise 10 day quarantine required 
- fines 1600€
- country splitted way forcing tested
- everyone afraid 2 weeks czech situation, hospitals way worst czech republic
- week (and week later) entire population tests start (population 5,5 milions)
- shops remain opened none customers go (suspicious need pay loses ""opened"") fine then? Order pizza, learn cook. worth risk stress. see we're competing USA highest cases day Yes, don’t give 2 weeks Oh plan. Nov 4 disappears. Like in: douche charge orders labs shut down, tests destroyed, people go jail don’t go work, dead people mass dumped. least that’s read bullshit. See clip yesterday. Keep kids home educate online courses... hard time schools take advantage technological advancements life. “I'm distressed misrepresentations us ideas media. I've never taken money Koch neither Prof. Gupta Prof. Kulldorff.

Regardless who’s ‘publishing’ petition ... could easily wordpress website... authors don’t vested financial interest. Thats impossile implement west Lockdown strategies could bring untold death suffering too. Keep mind need make everything one year. first grader 11 years. 11th grader might bit difficulty would also able independent study time school. Maybe should, maybe Probably. also tell supporters uses focus groups constantly like politicians. Trump's astonishingly stupid difference uses groups supporters. going about? talking victimless crimes, sex trafficking reckless driving. less point, conflating lot different things happen illegal seem understand are.

And think federal government taken action, less power political expediency. Whether states power willingly facilitate pandemic ugly dilemma one really wants solve.

The idea ""honest people,"" whatever means, follow laws really make sense first place. point making something illegal *does* reduce behavior among would-be offendors. 96% deaths people aging 45yrs. Comparing deaths really good idea affected many factors. surprises USA managed pump numbers thought India going overtake USA 99.9% people know kids them. even trust people take care cat. many people see things like children marriage, part life checklist. actually cut things. 2020, one kids. nolife it. PDX here- get Idaho even Montana time. many level 1 trauma centers specialized surgeons available away coasts. Damn near every family member introduction includes “I don’t know guys get around huge city!”.....PDX population around 650k. Never good outcomes patients gave start pandemic. patients still pretty insistent getting it.

Didn’t really start turning things around Covid patients able get remdesivir hospital. wait enough people die republicans personally lost people close them. That's society live now, apparently. cops area aren’t like cops areas. Cops area, yet see one walking around without mask, towns with/without mandates. areas people anti mask need change. leading country Western world

Doubt, tried sorts thing destabilize countries western eastern world. certain degree better China “What hell Iowa?”

-Redditors outside US Yeah thanks!!! wear hate work 8 hour days public. Easy wear 10 minutes maybe. also would like go bars ya know, see faces?? Slovakia can't go work unless test negative.

In America, fired report it. got pulled masked cop yesterday. Turns turned yellow light tail end didn’t clear light turned red. So, went straight red light bust let go. think panic buying ensues people hoard medical grade masks?  probably get trolling people can't get dates. agree dont get appropriate PPE job, ie PAPR kits 3m versaflo going work long shifts. I’m seeing reports rising cases many counties...what going Africa? sub heard single news Africa since March...are fine? solve problem financial assistance. 

We solve people dead suffering permanent organ damage. talking sides mouth. I'm done. sad. know scary claiming things somehow get better start triage ifr already lower run beds delusional. Wow wtf. Even country standard (Im Italy tell even people total idiot Covid) fucked up. understand way helping spreading even shit place?? Trump using rapid tests finger prick test, much higher false negative PCR. use worse test even everyday. could positive week finding out. almost like wearing masks prevents people getting virus. thought claims ""cure"" treatment, prevention. source shitty blog.

By way euromo shows large raise excess deaths Sweden year compared previous years. map look week 14 example, graphs look whole 2020 compared previous years, much worse. needed proper leadership top proper planning. Even small country 5 million start year 12 million N95 surgical masks reserve health workers next pandemic (after lessons learned Swine flu). Also local factory capable making masks too.

Now that's enough masks big country like US pandemic stock reserves? That's supposed tide month make more. could make N95s? outsourced mask manufacturing countries like China, Vietnam etc. believe DPA executive order would useful back January start making millions masks day, little late. Even making enough masks. could put N95 hands every man, woman child mandate use public areas indoors next month would make huge difference.

Surely five eyes intelligence services could alerted government much sooner January plague they're practically useless national defense used spy citizens. remember. know, every scientist recommending them. hand, first Easter, supposed rocking July, miracle summer, labor day, plan eventually go away. different Fauci others. reason believe number inaccurate red areas trying downplay it? you! Thanks kind words, every time hear someone think nurses, respiratory techs, anesthesiologists deserve praise. I'm perioperative assisted front lines since NY surgeries.  least universal healthcare cover necessary treatment. Yeah big stretch. Genome backdating puts [around late take active cases perspective well. 700k active cases India. Suppose virus doesn’t spread fatality rate remains around 1%, would mean recovery rate 99% i.e. 99% people recovered. now, don’t know many people 700k die recover. might right, afterall would post first place? honestly dont seek things out. Reddit populated front page. didnt join sub. run app happen see thread full people making personal judgements people. wont argue personal experiences. give benefit doubt, though, believe would extend courtesy. maybe I'm wrong, I've wrong before. fact, past January virus......  Yeah hell happened Europe...meanwhile Africa fine That’s cheaper doctors office!  pandemic started Chinese New Year billions people travel around country go home. Think Thanksgiving travel steroids. every city lockdown. least wide state. fake. Occurred tests existed. almost nonexistent now. friends there. still wear masks indoors though, sure fucked reopening schools summer holiday imo. Cases pretty much went rise since happened. trusted kids responsible (and ofc mask mandates there). live close school \~1000 students saw masks social distancing happening there. think small restaurant sold data? lmaooo vaccines need 2 shots 30 days apart. [Burundi's President probably died 55 died 'cardiac arrest'. wife flew country COVID treatment week earlier. Humans evolved social creatures. meant interact people. Forcing people homes able see others speed limit fatigue. That’s stupid. didn’t force anyone use product. bought it, chose competitor theoretically got value paying it. always plenty budget hosts available.

Rackspace AWS AWS, largely focusing corporate clients. want go anything exploitative, closest you’ll get think took flak hosting porn sites early days — profited exploitative industry. grandparents people Lots morons think wear mask somehow infringe upon freedoms, apparently. way guess wear pants infringe freedom guess? 

I mean \*is\* tough choice all: put extra item clothing potentially killing someone line living biohazard /s Cops also bad following traffic laws don’t seem issue enforcing those, usually authoritarian purpose public health. People seem understand this.  Fuck anyone get it. definitely need really strong worded national PSA runs commercial major networks around clock.  think work biggest influence. I’ve working home since March. company takes virus seriously rules restrictions physically go somewhere. sorta became normalized me.

I could see you’re retail restaurant worker, work life never changed makes harder understand what’s going on. There’s reason it’s called ‘airplane crud’ get almost every time fly. thank you, I’ll drive leave country right now. anyone acknowledging fact

People acknowledging this. problem though *some* people using excuse inaction.

And main reason IFR dropping younger people getting detected infections. virus become noticeably less deadly, better treatments. Inaction absolutely right response right now. Welcome Costco. love you. happens foods going China...

Never food China us. R0 disease behave beginning new. One person infected 3 people.

With current restrictions 1 person infects around 1,5 person average one moving anywhere.

What isnt clicking folks say line?  compelling phrase regarding people “who started 2020 us won’t Thanksgiving”. Well put. curious since I’ve seen post multiple times last five minutes haha. Idc man curious   even know WTF benzo is, let alone take them. Take drug conspiracies somewhere else, DICK president tells citizens go recovered. comes better treatment. March place. arent. group behaviour, need get momentum going, Evangelical Churches GOP leaders need play ball rather assume science eventually fix problem lambasting prevent recognition medicine fixed it, supernatural figure. see you’re upset topic. I’m merely positing person’s potential point view. recommend animal crossing switch one find one stores need get shit together employ mandatory mask store. people don’t wanna wear either A) starve B) shop online aren’t public. win win Guess we'll suspected disease vectors rest miserable lives then. would edited titles allowed. plague talking about? haven’t something like US since 1918 yes, masks helped. It’s going matter. won’t enough, multiple strains, proven antibodies don’t last (reinfected). I’m sorry say it, better get used whatever type life living isn’t going anywhere magical (possible stroke giving) vaccine. never made one coronavirus, especially 9 months time. wish could look way do, unfortunately right way. Man made virus born wuhan I'm planning wait least six months deciding want jab. It’s even title post looks year whole September separately. havent seen one body streets! one body streets much ask dangerous pandemic time? they'll give plenty Facebook, Instagram TikTok Right imagine much worse could been

And could still get majority comment complete bullshit, vaccine Trump admin pushed mutating virus. point, sub pot calling kettle black, throwing misinformation left right bitching misinformation given majority US leaders. late get 2inch 8 foot PVC pipe use hand candy either window creative location property. $7 hardware store. open bags needed instead dumping bowl contaminating time. Use gloves mask, fun matter doing! 

If going it, safe! that’s case local leaders (and members) unfortunately ignoring directions main leaders (the apostles etc). 
In area allowed meet summer I’m sure rural areas may think know better etc. regardless [here (from example POV actual leaders church, though per post seems listening, happens followers organization. family UT return church 1x month summer ~50 per meeting normally ~300 would attend, etc, even attending (and always is) optional meetings also broadcast online root cause stupidity failure educational system...then still feel little sorry them. anything, modern mobility environmental degradation raise chances us dealing infectious disease. don’t understand “it’s [current year], control” argument. Thank you, appreciate that. scary polarised people gotten. Covid-19 care politics. think fighting either. US starts PCR test

FTFY can't reason somebody position reasoned into.   American Civil War II: Mask Dilemma arent though. every mask seen maybe 1 percent homemade. toilet paper hand sanitizer shortage showed us enough. say ""kids cancer die hoard hand sanitizer"", still hoard make profit fuck cancer patients. 

You think people would profit pain cancer patients suddenly pull face masks? illogical true there'd fewer Roman Catholics Massachusetts. Never stopped enforcing DUI domestic violence laws. surfing refer peaks ""waves"", even see ocean floor them. Might easy say, much others.

When look pandemic whole. entire thing could avoided proper policy response. “Good News” flair! Schools likely helping spread communities, thousands asymptomatic super spreaders, remember even though kids may seem sick, still spread communities. well know lots Canadians masking giving shit. Regardless whether people shouldn’t wearing masks, people aren’t wearing much less likely mandate. phases include spouses healthcare workers, first responders teachers? not, it’s lateral move, right? don’t think daily numbers matter. people like don’t believe matter, assume daily cases don’t matter. 

That’s opinion one shared universally scientific community. US cops get cut fines?? type order make people, already aware Covid dangers already follow mandates, pause reassess future gathering necessary. people ignore mandates deny science care either way, would lie matter mandate limits. Hopefully, net effect fewer gatherings mandate fewer transmissions. stupid, stupid.  say maybe. top doctor passive aggressive? Sorry, doubt competence people able hold sign right way taking photo - claim doctors hand. want like Trump call people names least make sense make sense expose ignorance. Fair point. initial comment hyperbole fact believe. believe much country completely reach herd immunity, begin see effects ""stradegy"" perhaps 40 percent country contracted virus point. 

You however, choose, many worse case scenarios argument death rate herd immunity threshold argument reinfection given prove create worse symptoms? last one unfounded. Reinfection happened extent happen unknown. personal gatherings driving spread small ""couples dinner parties"" like assert - they're big birthday parties, house parties, etc, completely unmasked. many times worse restaurant, least restaurants commercial HVAC systems designed filter push air space. people restaurants seldom spend hour, encouraged wear masks least part time. What? 7 day moving average covid deaths 1 2 September.

Edit: Checked worldometers. probably confusing cases deaths. reddit moment.  couldn’t imagine thinking 120,000 deaths acceptable number consider ‘round turn’. 

How may deaths many??

120,000+ dead Americans outrage masses. 

America (and Trump) seems like they’re desperate someone blame. “It’s Trump’s fault came here, it’s China’s.” one reached American soil 100% Trump’s responsibly President keep country safe failed 120,000 people well MILLIONS infected. Sure possible, albeit significantly less likely respiratory transmission. Again, better reason people wear masks. wonder children managed survive 1900s universal public school! Fuk teachers nurses right? There's also social actions suspect Europe might bit lacking in. can't speak country, China, streets became deserted following news p2p transmission even without lockdown measures. spontaneous, sustained ~87% reduction cross-country travel (despite people stuck hometown) similar drops metro usage. still returned 2019 levels even now. much *lockdown* *shutdown*.

For parts EU/NA get sense people trying carry lives governmental rules restrictions imposed. suspect social reactions made lockdowns unnecessary much East Asia. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Europe super bad shape even talking about? Australians took pretty authoritarian approach. 

In serious cases, Australian government locked people apartment buildings windows opening couple centimeters. could go out, food delivered residents. would probably die kid brought home covid infected me

And imagine kid carrying whole life. Sigh, you’re still way blogger. correct (I’m assuming, don’t figures phone check). correct. using different methodologies. one aren’t per capita basis. Secondly averages. 

Your point valid; wasn’t making point though. presenting perfectly comparable per capita adjusted total number deaths period Jan-sept whole series. That’s Task viruses develop immunity alcohol know Reddit loves Joe Rogan dumb piece shit done much harm. people call standup comedian he’s even funny. He’s blowhard asshole should’ve stuck fear factor.  YES! Enough Americans stupid childish make right choices own, time treat they're acting. can't behave like adult adult choose behave. Beginning pandemic: wear mask. pandemic: errrr mmmm ya wearing masks.


Fuck guy bat virus rode on. Pods work look mathematics. work, pod needs exclusive every single member - means NOBODY pod allowed significant contact anyone outside it. even one pod members works crowded environment friends, lose protection. Why? dictate anyone's life home consensus America won’t enough testing Spring 2021, it’s acceptable believe places like India Brazil much higher unofficial infection rates America, since they’d likely even less testing population.

Alongside that, believe America rated #1 dealing pandemics. Wonder happened that... Id like see number too. Though one thing know people never even develop symptoms active infection. Seems like safe bet never even primary symptoms won’t long term issues since nothing recover from. GDPR become weapon ""unintentional bio-terrorists"" collaborators. applied way. Lol deeply flawed understanding sex feel badly haven’t experience women like sex. Thats cool man. afraid. afraid. Florida per capita death rate 765. would make 5th highest compared country earth.

Saying ""much better"" top 10/52 (inc PR DC) country that's disaster good look. Yep, might continue it. flu certainly transmits surfaces. habits going change forever. Even liberal area WA state, local city police chief county sheriff said wouldn’t enforcing. Police forces full garbage people everywhere. soooooooo many people children, really exposing issue. trying minimize education. think parents enough support teachers. think room improvement tho. people know struggled school got help needed others didn't.  agree 100% said evaluating risk. People understand exponential growth. think balance. education got job, tenacious working house cars getting ahead. actually talking teacher friend mine also saying person classes. There’s mandate state VA half people ignore it. Including close friends. really sucks. bad damn cops even wearing wearing mask way effective wearing mask.

No not. work.

[This clearly see January 1 onset COVID middle March, mortality rate significantly *below* average. Then, next three half months, mortality rate significantly *above* average. much so.

Since July 15, mortality rate floated around average.

Something smell right blogger's claims... year 2020 far, ie January - September, number deaths per capita third lowest ever. 

That claim seems total bullshit. Referring back latest spreadsheet, calculated number deaths year period January 1 September 30. numbers:

  2015: 67,759
  2016: 65,985
  2017: 66,969
  2018: 67,684
  2019: 63,874
  2020: 70,324

To calculate per capita rate used population figures population 31/12/2014 calculate rate 2015, 31/12/2015 calculate rate 2016, on. get rates:

  2015: 695.15 per 100,000
  2016: 669.83 per 100,000
  2017: 670.01 per 100,000
  2018: 668.80 per 100,000
  2019: 624.37 per 100,000
  2020: 680.93 per 100,000

2020 even third lowest rate last six years, let alone ""ever"".

It sure hell seems like blogger fudging numbers...  dunno, I've trading ranges years.....you ignorant. Unless ranges TA you.

That joke bruh. comedy, truth here...there range reason, (testing, natural spread etc.) breaks means something changed...

Don't poo poo things basic knowledge of.  Ethics aside, even smart way achieve want. NYC used 57% positive rate. tested already pretty sure it.  rate plummeted everyone started getting tested even without symptoms.

They taking kids testing droves drive positive rate. CDC lost credibility. guess big risk, literally hurts involves one. take extra super care brebaje gives peace mind home. Shit think wife COVID. lost smell yesterday, sore throat. Today I'm coughing lungs, days headache diarhea, discovered symptoms too. went test, we'll results Monday. live suburbs Paris, France, we're mid thirties, many cases around us (friends, colleagues).

And discovered Thursday wife pregnant. trying long time. Strange timing, one day one best news life, day probably caught deadly virus causing worst pandemic one century... ok (in good health both), emotionally hard swallow. Nationwide remember reading 25% students able access remote learning, due number technical reasons (lack broadband) economic (lack equipment one household WFH)

This world bank article countries world remote learning. poor countries like India Malaysia help children online learning, compare here, richest powerful country world. Good way get couple holes chest want virtue signal. See, holding crucial position like POTUS, get sympathy failing job.  That's... Christian holidays work. get ""skipped"" even people allowed participate. sources argumentation yet? rude without facts? 

It’s ok wrong know. 

You don’t dork though. Anything possible 2020 Nice see quote aphorisms. I'd like see demonstrate wisdom recognize ""laws"" simply memes nowhere near force truth scientific law. using actual heuristics judge things, fool. think BLM protests didn’t effect spikes plain ignorant! I’m saying BLM protests weren’t reason definitely didn’t help. I’ve looked plenty photos protests it’s around 70-30 mask wearing. drinking kool aid hard think otherwise. would mattered. 
 guy another dumb statement.  vote first time time. hey need keep false narrative head please it.  can’t test all, neither you.

...which I’m going assume healthy fine.

I’m done trying talk sense someone digs heels faced contradictory evidence. 

And yes, take still bad. feel get away it.

Yeah, law changes feel like get away it. deterrent effect good thing regardless lack 100% effectiveness. jaywalking. busy downtown setting makes think twice maybe walking next intersection. wrong tho Go Bucks! Hou never mandate it. total accident, birth control failure baby firmly believe abortion actively decided wanted kid, even though earlier planned (25 vs 30). best life decision pregnancy hell impending arrival forced making lot changes mental health something definitely made life better.

I stayed home fjrst 3 years decided go back school, he's daycare preschool last two years felt LOT guilt around busy. Covid definitely given chance get reacquainted he's rad little dude. hurts nobody. ritual would probably die kid brought home covid infected go work. enough time couple weeks vacation hold position took extended leave.

So hopefully masks legit haha Probably, extreme reaction. world's missing bit common sense, that's all. simple things done right everyone we'll fine. Unfortunately, everything becoming political today. realize there's difference paying sex literally killing people, right? ""Experts"" said wear mask March. 

""Experts"" said asymptomatics spread disease.

""Experts"" said can't really catch surfaces. 

These ""Experts"" say virus around 2023 can't eliminated without mass vaccination. think ""Experts"" interest virus around. Literally every business mask mandates social distancing. state parks required masks shuttle busses. RMNP requires reservations get in. exception sitting eat outdoors single time observed anyone wearing mask. even shocked find people wearing masks little podunk mountain shops. stand firm CO less 25% compliance. neck beard made comment get making inaccurate wild claims. plain masks really help much validate shitshow  yeah see people Italy ""acting"" ICU empty collapse system lie told deep state. jeez pathetic predict say Yes, get rid kids hours day *to go work.* 

When schools closed went leave stay home kid. school reopened, excuse leave anymore go back work School wasted effort year. impossible learn traumatizing situation. There’s boatload peer reviewed, published science back up. best book explaining Body Keeps Score Bessel Van der Kolk. can’t concentrate, can’t retain information, can’t memorize things, separated friends - list goes reasons poor grades. I’d shocked even 10% students performing well last year, I’d suspect they’d mostly self-taught introverts best work alone.

The surge happening worldwide due schools open. know it. knew would happen, though I’ll honest didn’t expect suddenly hit hard. guess makes sense given many schools opened suddenly.

I’ll see y’all next spring, I’m locked down. heart goes students. okay. futures still intact - look different past. smart species collectively figure out. won’t happen 2020, since previous generations fuck fellow millennials, dedicated helping protecting younger me. given worst modern economic conditions pre-pandemic since depression. graduated college 2008. one gave fuck us, millennials going give fuck you. Joe Rogan said it’s hoax LMAO well played... use get custody.

YOU CUNT Technically totally agree you. fear lack will. ""My mother doctor"" source. Please speak health care professionals large based one anecdote, cry work time. question general. many cases probably yes, many cases probably no. depends many people there, wearing masks, wearing masks, you’re moving around staying place, rate transmission state, etc etc etc.

also, it’s foolish assume anyone could answer question time. new virus, isn’t fully understood, isn’t enough information answer general question. know BLM protests looked like would drive outbreaks, didn’t, nice surprise. could also last Christmas child... pandemic limited testing resources might concerns, especially wide-scale genomic testing. point gazillion different testing labs &amp; collection points there's way they're collecting analyzing samples DNA purposes. Remember vast majority tests contracted private labs incentive analyze specimens preserve future testing (both cost $$$). Although understand mean, fair, since agreeing abiding rule live together, inherently political. (Most people surprisingly narrow definition politics, accuse something political, they're talking power struggle big names/institutions.) don’t think person voting what’s driving spread.

And transfer power must occur inauguration day 2021 regardless. It’s happening western pa sure. precipice restrictions reimposed people keeping infections secret untested keep numbers down. Yeah ridiculous MT. Nobody enforces everyone thinks hoax. Worse, jokes derivative couple gags. fuck nut jobs then. Maybe stop condescending cunt. Sorry, we're allowed sad preventable COVID deaths, preventable cancer deaths. They’re complaining COVID interrupt sportzball season literally priorities - football life Europe better Heath care system US. Better Heath insurance yes miles. Better Heath care, no. US generally best doctors hospitals world. Note: generally. outliers. Oh no. mask face. life over. makes sense. heard President said we’ve turned corner. beautiful corner. 

It’s beautiful?

Damn. he’s President. wouldn’t lie. unecessary toxic comment. normal sub? big point. 

I don’t think everyone believes real. know couple people don’t wear masks, ever. point they’ve never known anyone virus never seen documented ( photo) proof overwhelmed hospitals, people placed halls waiting room etc,,, 

They think it’s joke one mask wearing social distancing people falling for. half stores I'm said wont enforce patrons wear despite mandated here. fucking insane. Frankly, legal punch nose see. Oh, true. first sentence odd one. Hang there! right thing! Uk especially shit job, there’s much higher population density Australia NZ. though, it’s obviously complicated along people feeling comfortable hanging small medium gatherings friends family, going eat, getting back dating scene, etc. mask mandate live everywhere go people wearing, attempting wear, mask. Yet numbers still rising.

Go ahead mask mandate, change day day. wonder much actually help. need contact researchers oxford let know you’ve got findings contradict theirs. follow advice health experts urging us so, political wackjobs reality deniers. agree. whole intelligent lockdown fucked up. following rules since March.. even stricter government tells us do. 

The problem intelligent lockdown people following rules compensate people give fuck. 

I hope government step serious rules. change anything people already following make possible way force people give fuck stay home. herd immunity good? worked flu, common cold others. Course mutate often, already flu pretty normalized deadly covid, well people already prone illnesses Europe mean many different things depending context comes Covid usually means EU EEA. 

Also title calls Europe 'region', sloppy use language calls sort clarification. Now, I've met *some* people suggested need focus maximizing effectiveness existing suppression measures (like, handwashing mask-wearing), instead implementing new ones (like, school closures lockdown). reason this, argue, increase compliance, keep things balanced, reduce ""public shaming"" ""snitching"", avoid ""bad reactions"".

**Keep mind, however, obviously going situations - maybe once, *sometimes* - mere *guidelines* going much. *In cases, need take game virus one step upwards, start taking stricter measures lockdown, school closure, increased police social scrutiny.***

Yes, get it. strict kinds measures popular. everyone guaranteed follow happen. alternative much worse: overwhelmed hospitals, people passing street like Wuhan Italy... might seem like happen many months pandemic, trust me, recent reports certain localities reinstate field hospitals March April, *can*.

Also, nothing wrong people telling other. public aspect social incentives encourage people follow rules already... anyone tell what's supposed ""wrong"" that?

It's best avoid making local epidemic situation bad enough increased restrictions necessary. However, especially considering many people already flouting *guidelines*, *will* times inevitable - think ""circuit breakers"" currently going Wales, Scotland, Ireland. case, better reimplement restrictions, even they're 100% perfect, rather disregard situation let scary numbers continue alarming surge. wait, diseases covid? Stuff like pausing cancer surgery never made sense, keeping kids home likely did. Wear work, employees customers required wear masks social distance. Even though it’s strict company policy see employees break room pulling masks talking other. taking eating conversation right next someone else might taking break. used remind people breaking protocols always anyway. talk management enforce rules awhile eventually goes away. break protocols too. finally gave keep myself. refuse mask cop work it’s making difference anyway. law required wear right people right slap you.

Great idea, know laws made democracy, right? I'm assuming job leave house? plan total lockdown December (literally opening door) visiting family Xmas. risk?  want point providing outdated sources march much better sounds like wanting win point online discussion me

Outdated sources March, 2020? many publications Covid March, 2020?

I’m trying win point. I’m trying ""verified specialist"" think know use good scientific practice selectively want win point.

Why think sub option someone credentials verified?

Discussions like part scientific process. scientists work. UT: 10 cases, 5000 dead  Ridiculous people get need mask gathering people live situation distanced. pretty much indoor situation. kids school age I'd keeping home even schools opening right now, keep safe.

Then there's Trash-Tier, jackass parents shit risking kids get rid kids hours day. Keep they're gonna get rid kids permanently. sickens me. Please I'm crying longer goes think picture 1918 people wearing masks sign said wear mask go jail. think wonder long people back put shit got sign. got thinking brain. give 2% life save last years 0.1% population? 

It sounds terrible, truth sacrificing much life saving, people uncomfortable decision. Nah go populated areas wear them, there's lot education system failed indoctrination parents know better trust experts... (Remembers sis's bf trust experts news....) remains seen. months ago Europe looking nose America patting back leaders listened science expected. they're worse outbreak states.

It's entirely possible Asia simply entered seasonal cold flu season, like Europe felt like things control. Asia complex seasonal patterns. Actually, probably will, likely opposite effect. refuse wear mask take rally cry, arguing rights taken away something. words, think serve energize anti-maskers (is anti-masker term? Imma say term...).  we'd pay fine wearing mask, fine want 'peacefully protest'? I’m sitting country four cases, picked airport arrival, community spread, everyone wears masks, mandated, almost opposition masks. shocked masks mandated still debate whether mandated. Like strikes absolutely batshit crazy masks would mandated, can’t imagine weak public health laws 
authority must let masks remain optional. Absolutely batshit crazy. Yeah. There's variation, lot confusion stemming early tests shoddy high false positivity rate among early antibody tests. Simply put, lot people also thought previously covid didn't. sadly know person like got sick. might worked beginning, late. kill makes ~~stronger~~ packed solid chronic issues. badge full sight know are.

These people defending masked badge less feds Portland shithole country Fauci also donates millions dollars Wuhan's laboratory also told us masks 3 months pandemic goes scientific standards ever!. point man 30 years failed us mattered most. hold says much trust earned it. moms this, it'll end prolonging pandemic probably lead lockdowns Utah.

It's matter time hits rare asymptomatic contagious superspreader kid infect thousands people. That’s problem lot issues worked gym morning. set corner mostly workout without mask nose/mouth. chin pulled flash i'm traveling zones. keep plenty distance. members even bring mask. they're seemingly oblivious. wave person they're walking zone. often seem surprised roll eyes.

it going long winter. Everyone like fascist. I'm waiting pull nazi card next. Except 1 million+ died others suffer long-term side effects difficult recoveries, virus perfectly harmless! DK ask countries lmao. Talk someone left fucking zip code!

I wonder they're Autobahn speed limits surprisingly car accidents. Hmmmmm. Maybe American infrastructure horribly outdated (just like people good fucking grief) need dire overhaul?

""After all, Germany's famed Autobahn posted speed limits, 2010, country's fatality rate per billion-travel-kilometers motorways stands impressive 1.98 deaths – much lower United States fatality rate 3.62 deaths."" look nba youtube video counts decide less popular. think younger people watch anything network television. Thank work colleagues do. restrictions? look like? government pay y'all stay home? science based approach

Come now. know one party wouldn’t agree EEEEEEEEEET!! Pissed hear say that, get plastic curtains anything cheap shit, especially local owner willing work yourself. acting like rape exist, peer pressure exist, alcohol exist. Also assuming condoms alone 100% effective, not. overlooking cost burden procuring maintaining type contraceptive. glossing fact abstinence sex ed effective. glossing many many reasons ""personal responsibility"" conservative agenda first, appling reasoning after. 
 
**Please stop spreading ignorance.** making everyone dumber around you. easier deny reality play pretend, rather face terror pandemic head-on common sense solutions led health experts. time children grow up. are! look college students getting first two weeks school opened. There's ""friends dinner parties"", froshweek, frat pledge/initiation, etc... part it. weekly drunken college parties. gives fuck patients without covid more? let die, need low covid numbers countries emit travel warnings us :(

ridiculous tbh Surprised require mask showing. Maybe could cheap pack hand politely ask folks one? Try enforce mask find much heat I'll throw you. local police wearing them, going enforce wearing them.  like new CDC guidance indeed catch covid 15 minutes came letting prisoners wear masks intake. 

The worker mask prisoners didn't, infected worker.

Why TF let wear mask? cheap disposables flimsy strings. going strangle someone them. Absolutely reason. anything everyone allowed take masks bars restaurants. Anywhere food involved indoors shit spreading. Every restaurant state (MD) requires masks entrance only. guest table every single one takes duration.

I know sound ridiculous people need start wearing mask pulling bites/sips drinks. either restaurants bars need shut down. without federal help going cripple businesses already run small profit margin. Pandemic??? Don’t know hoax? demo at?  But... viruses ""alive"".. even headline. Smh could told people use homemade masks like now.

And they've known decades masks protect people viruses. act like figured March October. lied, plain simple. course North Dakota first place dir Hilfe pushing effectiveness condoms per say, using one many examples, probably I'm guy that's know. meant condom ad means. comment that's kind said though. gladly pay birth control. really one paying it. really radical belief? mean can't afford poor sex. Close legs, stop sleeping around, get job, pay choice birth control. sleep whole town want. Thank comment though. kind already knew this, well written informative hopefully someone else who's younger reads learns something. well thought comment hard find forum Walmart? said anything Walmart? Feel free check post history. I’ve talked compensation paused. please take Ammon Bundy back? He's real pain ass us basically we're nascar. spain UK lockdowns well.

judging not-so-hard-hit country (austria), find hard believe things done even less competently spain UK compared us, still dont understand huge differences death ratios, still assume due overseen factors (virus genetics, population genetics, vitamin levels, etc.) Unfortunately, sheriffs elected hard get rid unless criminal case brought them.  see many topics related this. Like every time someone 80 dies there’s post 100k upvotes filled comments patting back keeping 25 year old asses house 6 months even though .001% chance effected take knowing someone healthy died get movement conservative circles 

If RAND paul died colleague senate would care Trump survived think invincible moved new place recently looked pizza area. ordered something pickup last night. Pulled looked window saw least 3 employees, including kitchen staff, hanging really close, masks gloves. One cooks wiped sweat forehead immediately used unwashed hand whatever food making.

I called restaurant outside soon saw could cancel order. said late. said looking inside could see COVID violations happening restaurant. basically laughed refused refund me.

That yesterday. record-breaking height COVID cases US. ration medical care. That’s works instance world, would different Covid? wouldn’t put obese person back line medical treatment. wouldn’t put smoker back line treatment. 

Why feel need feel morally superior? You’re human like rest us. Next up: Develop vaccine seem remember supposed 2 million fatalities 2020 obviously model produced incorrect results!!

How incorrect? projection **if US literally nothing**. 

Nice troll. promised bodies streets. Maybe wait 2 weeks? someone pre existing conditions would high risk anyways mask mandate would actually benefit would led likely contract virus people. police wouldn’t able slap fine anyone, would options available like free mask offered them, suggestion curb side pickup, suggestion find another person shop them. mandate happens it’s law, people break law get fined. Also, number wrong, meant write $250 $2500. Meh, w/o winds it’s cold don’t feel cold anymore. least that’s southern gal’s take it. New york still hit unemployment overall restrictions. course virus causes initial layoffs, keeping state closed longer rest mean higher unemployment percentage people that's unemployed. Again, three always going economics hit hard, severe states closed stayed closed longer. I'm going go listen Smash Mouth song, can't think music band name playing, bunch redneck trailer trash bikers going listen to. theatre. live Italy so...yeah probably make There’s way hell country going 95% compliance mask usage. may regions scattered feasible that’s it.

Instead reporting projections, estimated numbers deaths nobody wore masks order wear masks feel good total deaths fall threshold. trump pushing things getting better “we rounding corner”.... he’s lying sack shit Almost 0 false positives, 99.5% specifivity. 50-60% false negatives though identifies currently infectious. explained another comment problem. know. best bet vaccines even thing herd immunity, would take much longer get get vaccine ready. Yeah, time \~20% US already immune virus lot people aware screws old, elderly infirm better job self-isolation. Plus there's nigh-unlimited supply high quality masks want one. Sadly plenty complaining it. seems like something could trivially automated. issues? know TX opted everything could corrupt governor gave 300m company yet anything outsource calling, like people think spam ignore it. huge failure country. Apple Google even implemented robust APIs nobody wants use them. Anyone remember way back days total amount people worldwide (officially)? ? question statement? removed post? strange Oh God. America President that's solution. Horrifying, I'm sorry. much better still weeks relaxed rules summer England. rules lockdowns, businesses also closed etc? can't imagine combination economic (mental) health crisis. Ugh. Yeah... ready shit get you, tought Italy chance relatively safe shit, wrong. prepared anyway could come uncertain times. ""We're rounding turn. We're rounding corner. going away."" - Trumpelstiltskin, last night's final Presidential Debate finally put bed Europe's worse America vice versa. 

These petty comparisons helps one. fucked everywhere. 

We need get shit together. going hitting 100,000 cases day soon im afraid real? said easy.

Like every single reply said ""not hard."" means easy.

In case want adopting child hard expensive like people think is.

On site vast majority 16+, 13 14 year olds, one family young adopt 6!!

Has sister kids older?

I think slightly easier kids went process already older children. can't imagine plopping teenager (a traumatized one that) life since I've never child, especially since friends young kids/ babies. 

But reason becasue sister easy means everyone. love people anecdotal ""facts.""  tried use antigen tests pt screenig here. Unfortunately problem false positives false negatives.

Has anyone seen sens/specs uses test? Seriously... Facebook friends post pro-Trump memes ones post anti-mask crap. There's direct correlation. 

The part can't figure Trump always talking vaccine yet Trumper friends say they're going refuse it. Approximately yes, 2/3 infectious, either patient already recovering / beating virus, yet infectious. latter group part caught following week everyone tested again. likely 100k daily cases Election Day. That’s highest number cases entirety pandemic. Biden right Americans headed dark winter. Also saw [article today saying hospitalizations rising **38 states**, alarming trend. 

Here COVID Tracking Project’s Hospitalization information showing sharp increase nationally regionally:

[Total currently hospitalized broken it’s worth noting prevalent COVID throughout country. high national baseline means entering winter primed rapid overwhelming spread everywhere. happened err'ing side caution? Seems concept lost. Human beings terrible gauging risk, tend stupidly optimistic chances. 

The gods help us all. '91 blizzard stop trick treating think sprinkles will. let's hope so. upvote it! quick! There's lockdown, Greater Buenos AIres hard March (as virus hitting harder rest provinces), phase 1 enforced provinces cities.

The ridiculously high positivity rate (which decreased bit) because[ less (since days ago, around 39k) daily tests performed 43M people country. hard right allow feel sadness anger instead always trying strong. wrong upset hand we've dealt. while, shake back try something comforting like walk beach.

This last forever. Hang there! Here's rounding corner, huh! here's miracle see coronavirus disappear warm weather, Easter, 15 cases quickly become zero. don’t say Yeah, woman, doctors take seriously talk sexual side effects having. God forbid women like sex want enjoy sex. Fucking puritans. Grandfather Nurgle pleased. Lol way you’re speaking assume you’re democrat. Try civil conversation instead name calling losing shit. read? dense?

Breathing also expels droplets. cloth mask better literally nothing all. people see San Diego wearing form homemade/cloth mask. might literally homemade medical grade. see mostly cloth type masks. people still believe him. think credibility...

What mean ""you people""? numbers getting better? Costco private business Ok based current death rates 83000 people 166 die. Close risk get car accident die tomorrow morning. exactly panicking over? 511,373 total February. 300k next 4 months next wave bad predicted. Don’t forget loud talkers. USA! USA! Q.Q Setting records year. Also, higher chance virus mutating spread? New Zealand since island effectively locked down. worked outbreak August entirely narrowed single source far know, probably faulty quarantining travelers. 

So yeah break entire world 5 million population islands fix pandemic months. interesting. companies start ramping production receive approval? likely issue fronts. Lol can't believe October 2020 people still say things like SOLELY based raw total cases got flat several months ago. That's longer standard. Get well soon!  Yawn Rookie numbers, better Oregon. 

-Florida. Nascarona  99.8% chance fine. aint going lie, I'd scared hell got infected particular stories strokes. Good luck. hope recover without severe symptoms. want push narrative global fucking pandemic nothing worry like republicans are, yes. talk narrative push within comment. remember getting goosebumps China 30k cases thinking they're fucked. 1+ million dead America alone time vaccine shows up. bad? given wh control data, might already 100K+ day. Way way more, almost 1.3 million today compared around 200k per day March/May would make sense number positive cases rise IFR decline.

For example want compare today say April 24th around 4 times many tests around 2 times Amount positives 

April 24th
290k tests
35k cases 

Oct 23
1.3 million tests
83k hahahahahahahahahahaha  would regret it? It’s true. shouldn’t regret telling truth, even people don’t want hear I'm Queensland, Australia pretty much did. Locked closed borders. still border restrictions locked within state months- aside travel stuff,  life pretty normal (you still sign places there's hand sanitiser everywhere that's nbd). 6 active cases state, none new today. We're hoping we'll fully open within Australia (and hopefully New Zealand) soon, continued testing tracing. state Victoria looking like control now. 

There's footy match Brisbane tonight 30k spectators expected. think part Aussies feel grateful response.  first year hospitals take part black friday sales? 2 high risk parents me. going staying home hiding much possible. old son?  robust test trace system, completely failed appear US. hahahahahahahahahaha I'm amazed seen healthcare workers go strike yet. Man could never take hippocratic oath. would absolutely refuse help people think hoax ignore warnings actual people dying. Highway funds fall 'very specific, limited situation' referring to, aid. 

A federal mask mandate would overturned courts way Trump trying force states enforce federal immigration regulations was. You’re real asshole. Yeah India hard Journey well. girl ever really wants POCKETS! muh freedom

/s Yes, didn’t think could get worse, Macri’s administration horrible, even voters (like me) recognize it. current president came oh boy.. past dictate future, virus determine far spreads now, behaviour. possible overload many hospitals across country numbers keep rising people gather inside more.

It really depends definition word collapse. think can't even go hospital heart attack something that's pretty close Oh yay police state Guinness probably hiring. suspect late night partying leads far less social distancing.  think online teaching? I'm online learning personally love it, found positive reception students due personal freedoms home offers them? gotta stop testing. Covid “problem “ solved. Make Merica great. People playing outside, riding motorcycles, hiking, way stay bit distanced enjoy modicum human contact. choices outside friends gone Midwest night time lows 20s Fahrenheit.

So choice hermit levels depression cautious close contact. looked article -- yeah, pretty lousy. bet article writer appropriate title chief online click baiting decided knew better. space guys have. worry keep everyone like 3 days. Whoever wrote article braindead, I'm praying Duh elections nearing Someone add see exceeded total population country yet. Right, people need know really real chance vaccine approved end 2020. We're literally talking 2 months here. High school? would drop out. Really big deal get GED So, recover! 

Yay!

Oh, wait, liver lung damage, blood clots, crushing medical bill life taking blood thinners.

Yay! last two days we've set record inpatient census counts COVID positive. Also seeing steady increase positivity three weeks 0-17 demographic.

I'm concerned community. Guys don’t test don’t cases, it’s obvious /s We’re also short staffed far nurses sheer amount cases sky rocketed. goes contact tracing nurses. Source: nurse ND.   like Covid19 version Barney Stinson's Get Psyched mix. people think waves rise fall, people WRONG. rise baby! Prescient words. I'd really like get antibody test, suspect town back January shortly first confirmed case. could flu, lot people know got highly infectious respiratory illness symptoms matching Covid. timing close suspicious. Damn way I'm jealous pandemic bringing back basically every mental illness ever thought conquered vengeance. Enough know Americans can't follow common sense Number cases absolute isn’t metric watch cause number tests administered varies. percentage tests came back positive? mean, theory could shut down. could intervene stop mortgages, rent etc. Freeze finance payments make everyone stay home. 

Then use time get competent tracing strategy running reopen bit bit. 

Also, happening worldwide. Look Korea. Australia. New Zealand. controlled. viable treatments therapies now. much different situation 6 months ago. Good. hope does. post really story. pretty straight forward stat true. right fatality rate, one creating narrative. supposed ignore surge cases percentage people dying gone percent? anti-maskers basically domestic terrorists. must fun parties /s Jesus Christ. keeps going Remember Pence said, ""15 cases control"" Yeah remember calls various groups people March, would guessing long lock would last. Two weeks, three weeks...I think longest estimate like eight weeks, everyone gasped skeptical disbelief. always asked, ""What circumstances think lead 'all clear?'"" admittedly fully believe said it, guess pool usually somewhere 5 months two years. I'm epidemiological nostradamus, reality. seemed quite contagious moderately deadly already everywhere, thus something would go away magically. Sadly Argentina’s economy already tanking prior COVID. may death knell. Next Venezuela? see met anyone hasn't. families afford put kids college inheritance left also form medical insurance, least supplemental insurance plus Medicare. already permanently damaged sexuality prozac- turns spare ‘rona lmao hard. Life funny sometimes around 350 last week. Anxiety? things control ability change anxiety stupidity. R/nottheonion tried get us wear masks science clear that. Yes, way later been. America pretty much every single conservative politician still refused listen. don’t get article trying prove context? 200k things get MUCH worse. every metric failed Rounding corner ""We're gonna die!!"" don’t use aid.

When feds wanted US drinking age uniformly 21, punished last holdouts depriving states federal highway funds. Louisiana last buckle. normal human empathetic response. Unfortunately days lot us possess empathy trait.... feel like I've already heard every day whole pandemic.  Good please continue. remember Dr. Fauci said always stuck said eventually US would see 100,000 new cases per day eventually. Looks like right again. Except meeting friends going bars MAKE HURRICANE WORSE.

This kind idiotic mentality exactly toilet paper shortages back March April. ""we're rounding corner."" He's appealing NASCAR fans. Don’t worry everyone, it’ll gone April!!! No, understand science, throw proof. really easy. show number studies show fabric filter viruses. have?  could ended with

1. 1 month national quarantine. 
2. Every American social security number sent $5,000 check. 
3. Heavily enforce mask social distancing
4. Temperature checks place public forced go ie grocery stores, banks, etc. 
5. Contact tracing apps programs. 
6. Huge investment healthcare system(but work anyways US Profit healthcare system huge injection means huge profits, huge investments)

This utter failure leadership. lot people saying negligent homicide. coworker mine got stuck india 6 weeks longer planned. landed hometown time airport close next day. took get together arrangements travel 8h car train Delhi catch flight cancelled. Nope. We’ve averaged 35k new cases per day 8 months That's assuming hospital medical professionals able maintain current work rate. far, they've put heroic effort, sincerely wonder much longer maintain current effort. Keep wearing masks nose :) Sure. look isolated island nation ~1% population EU that’s willing sacrifice entire economy. can’t it? Unfortunately coronaviruses also peak winter. *January.* Makes wonder expect. Wow that's lot cases month even ov- ONE-DAY!? High Speed Ring  That's also medical licensing works.

And would doctors afraid speak executive branch backing them?

""Literally everyone power agrees me, I'm afraid speaking out."" credible statistical evidence, backed scientists reliable journal, please shut fuck up.

Is Lancet reliable journal? US government? good starting point you. Took 2 seconds. Learn basic internet search insulting others. Yeah, knew would reach big cities big impact there, really thought US would nip bud became major issue small cities (like mine) rural communities (surrounding live). Hmmm. Seems like say that. Let's check again. Yep. right. say that.  *South Dakotan checks in* see Snapchat? Haven’t used year But, really like antique picture frame. owner shop told thing really needed. seemed like nice honest fellow, like wanted peace happiness town. Doom gloom headlines? fact. facts scare something? round 4th corner....back Yes That's good hear! India still 2/3rds peak new cases/deaths though! hope doesn’t quickly explode totally understand sentiment. mod subs there's controversy discussion sites. definitely easier allow certain sites always credible. help maintain credibility sub. 

So... Thanks good mod helping run good quality sub! That's it. keep going on. Lol. great weekend! 5 inches snow low tonight 17 winter us sucks, time case people age range. statistical anomaly even symptoms. 

I'm 20 know got tested antibodies. This, headline right here, 2020 wish best. Saying ""did everything right"" entirely accurate - situation describe seeing son, seen others... exact situation *literally* what's driving spread right now. Indoor gatherings amongst family friends immediate household - that's driving numbers up.  crazy saw time back March April nobody knew big numbers thrown around. data serve purpose want ever see mentioned anymore. Try living state minimal shutdown pretty jch open. masks. fucking great. time happy disabled(can[barely] afford work supplemental income). different filtering capability egress ingress? winner, winner, chicken dinner! Considering data sent white house real number must much higher. Thanks, think? one hand nice know specific insanity infecting countries, other, weep think human condition. 

I wonder what's r/eyebleach ? old you, mind asking? think so. tried lock everything, sweden didn't. Additionally think unlucky demographics first wave, whereas unlucky. course, think two strategies play differently we're seeing... probably luck too.

We also made switch working home span one day. Iirc 30-40% workforce made switch working home april. must've really helpful. office weeks back. really strange, empty halls 2 people cafeteria housed hundreds.

I know whether naive correctly assessing situation, see growing fully control. least like early Italy / NY. scattered population, also folks socially distant default. gets worse over, that's take. ""2 weeks bro"" Morons like huge part problem 15% positivity definitely too-high side. good news that, according Dumb Dumber, can't triple stack double stack.  *Keanu Reeves intensifies* new vaccine that's first kind way developed. say ""works perfectly"" mean response achieved patients exactly anticipated. mean perfect fully preventing covid learned back phase 1 what's replicated severity covid becomes minor flu vaccine basically puts realm annual flu shot since point covid basically staying us long long time. Surf's dudes! ppl fucking shitty? I'm front line worker I'm exposed lot, got sore throat one time days isolated completely; even let parents bring car (so drive tested); walked left keys me; let use days got negative result back. even fully think virus (symptoms really fit) wanted extra safe case might actually get someone infected. would mortified parents got sick suffered me, mention die. Argentinians wearing masks, don’t you’re highly fined, that’s happened one best friends. 

And regarding lockdown, no, obviously not, people need work. police catches them, sent jail least fined (there least 92 cases people assassinated “gone missing” violating lockdown). 

I personally violated lockdown see parents first time three months, people least once, others scared breaking law don’t it. think crime going lose much profit. Differently legitimate business, need follow restriction, definition.  Except whole world facing exact thing now. Especially Europe. Inb4 cherry pick country thats not, ignoring states US aren't.  Yes say it’s small population shouldnt exist I'm recovering virus now. relatively young/fit/healthy take care yourself, likely feels like mild/moderate flu. Like curfew even do? people think Covid gonna say “oh it’s past 11:00, time bed!” ?!?! authoritarianism astounding jesus sees shadow. agree, know Sturgis south, geographically speaking, they're right next door you.  Hope feel better man. sure people hostile.

Edit: also reminder people, he’s normal dude, guy decon shower SCBA gear goes outside house positive pressure filtration system. giving shit abortion made sense, increase access birth control increase sex education, abortions go naturally. really, ought voting way really want prevent unwanted pregnancy. going away anytime soon. I've said beginning. stay. People think go away vaccine going fix delusional. mention there's possibility vaccine ever happening; summer people said vaccine fall. almost past halloween going winter sign vaccine seen.

The harsh reality virus stay long time find way live it. Shelter old vulnerable, let rest us get back normal. exactly done cold turkey lock-downs 2-3 months done (aka Wuhan-style lockdowns) Unless want use cannabis people actually think 300,000 people die 6 months death rate considerably lower (at 50%) first half 2020, 2,000 people died every day, even took 8 fucking months get 220,000.

Yo, live Florida wanna stay tf home. disgusting treating bs. I'm tired, I'm mentally exhausted literally waiting catch thing. partner restaurant managers treating like nothing's happening. wanna stay home ? Consider us unemployed. fucking expendable. say that?

Guess we're different. Impossible, president said turning corner would done soon

/s don’t know continuing. reckless talking big “hoaxes” kind loses appeal actually know people sick. sobering people. still, going fraction people refuse see common sense. Hopefully rest us wearing masks washing hands enough put brakes least slow down. think it’s pretty fair say full freedoms democracy worst government/social structure deal pandemic. People need take chin, country west simply couldn’t done shutdown level China wE’rE lEaRnInG lIvE Sweden 11 times deaths per capita? difference lockdown silly assumption would lockdown made difference?

edit: though one difference guess - Sweden may slightly populqtion density biggesr cities? We're going die. pray everyone gets mild dose recovers soon. I’m sorry health treated casually. ❤️ Ah Gary Johnson ""climate change matter sun explode one day"" approach. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia New Zealand. Manaus estimated around 2/3 prevalence end. Hahaha think guys making past November? Wonder many imprisoned Uighers ""volunteered"" test subjects vaccine development 🙁 public health officials even viciously harassed threatened COVID-deniers. Like Dr Acton Ohio :( control group less COVID-19 infections, less overall poor health outcomes could attributed constant masking? MAGAing hard Dude situation similar brother ur place fam tested negative started fro bro’s baby mama gave kids bro knew someone house sick finally told us developed symptoms. fam take easy man. mean, yes lived mansion park, swimming pool home gym I'd ok take every protective measure hurricanes, doesn’t keep coming. America live die benevolence billionaire overlords! Land free! worry, going magically fix Easter. ""See I'm talking about, 83,000, significant gains.

~Donny T. get once, immunity getting period time, like flu America shithole country yet? 300? rookie numbers. 


Seriously though, hope everyone affected Norway escape unscathed. It’s almost like masks don’t work. ""very likely"" Covid-19 show similar seasonal pattern common human coronaviruses, continued, citing types including HKU1, 229E clearly longer understand country can’t learn lessons keep repeating mistakes.” Incorrect

Anything beyond 500 million deep overshoot

And go back ASAP 

But reducing birth rates

Not increasing death rates. increasing death rates go 500M carry BAU four. Yeah do. People cry. normal reaction stress society pumped machismo testosterone juice even big deal. I've seen plenty doctors hospital cry. Almost like stressful job.

Would call unprofessional laugh office? jump something surprised you? call hurt yourself? emotions allowed? Come guys..it’s “under control”. it’s countries populace willing listen. China certainly emerging world power department, compliance distancing requirements definitely cultural think med rooms for? DtRump supp0rters. US stand second France yesterday people still claim it’s bad flu. still lower death rate higher survival rate... ignorance still keeps going welcome rest world. USA still #1 We're turning corner. Lol live like 10 minutes road parents asking move back temporarily blew over. Mom's gonna mom haha Island bit easier.

I count Australia too.

Lots Europeans went vacations summer brought home September. young people spread care go parties Don’t worry turning corner..... right cliff Thank you! I’ve actually healed month half. damn it’s crazy wife working home (in small NYC apartment) 10 month old boot. can’t find time exercise, that’s alright. least I’m spending time daughter otherwise wouldn’t right? Roundin fuck corner. fingers crossed, stay safe. doubt Trump’s load even measurable much less spraying.  Probably it’s like dust. That's almost guaranteed 830 deaths. Good thing we’ll cure week half

/sarcasm

It’d nice someone held worthless sack shit accountable. Winter  half Covid deaths involve pneumonia? primary way kills then? mother probably ashamed behavior she’s really doctor. implement it, least first three months one could social activity, buy supplies among things. started opening up, still tight provinces.

Now, months ongoing lockdown, people starving basically Argentinians violated lockdown least once, personally violated see parents (I hadn’t seen three months), people work. luckily work home problem that. However, people may that, cop finds out, either sent jail highly fined. least 92 known cases people going missing assasinated violating lockdown. There’s famous case dude who’s daughter passing away cancer couldn’t say goodbye lockdown. yeah, it’s still going on, maybe hard before, it’s still ridiculous. sub turned sub full useful life saving information regarding pandemic political, fear mongering sub. one majority, frankly sick shit. almost like worst spikes Conservative areas snowflakes refuse wear masks Yeah, heard what’s going Poland? Congratulations U.S. setting another record! say Easter?? Easter year? It’s respiratory virus. It’s almost always continuous close contact someone infected. idea getting surface isn’t really realistic. hadn’t seen kid half month. likely kissed him, hugged spent lot close time him. 


Not really something wrong. mother let know Kid likely exposed. Wear mask pick coffin. \*shrugs\* good joke, get joke. never was. Coming person alive right means something me. means know shit predictions true. even told wear masks April? seemed obvious time literally friends saying wearing mask would trap virus increase risk infection. post back March shared anyone would listen, did. /r/4chan Covidbanga! haha, writing made laugh. hopefully knows better now. * Phase one will cover 5% 10% population. vey first doses go frontline health care workers, especially taking care COVID-19 patients first responders likely exposed virus. 



* Phase two will cover 35% population include teachers, school staff child care providers. first second phases focus high-risk populations living congregate settings, including prisoners people living homeless shelters. 



* Phase three will cover 45% population include workers essential businesses, like colleges, universities, hotels, restaurants, banks places moderately high risk virus transmission. young adults 18 30 included phase, even though typically less severe disease outcomes. 



* By phase four, goal cover much general population feasible. time, pharmaceutical companies likely tested approved vaccine children. Percent people infected die. Includes people get virus, ones got test

For example early NY outbreak death rate 5-10% range, antibody testing found actual cases 10x higher official cases. IFR calculated 0.73% antibody study. stupid things like organize large public gatherings encourage people attend without masks... 3 years sure. Id bet loser legal background im sure feels cool telling another guy coronavirus subreddit get custody kids forget Vietnam New Zealand. Logarithmic scale Belgium hit pretty fucking hard. honestly dont get Right 3 deaths within group still damn unlikely. winning? Check back 2-3 weeks It’s life death, getting coroanvirus far given people permanent reduced lung capacity, knows else do. virus still new, still unknown, want young healthy. Even won’t kill you. smell conspiracy theories already. Wave² Ignore bro, people downvoted much reason thread record Oregon?

Those rookie numbers compared Wisconsin, 4000 new cases today.  Literally reason 500,000 deaths right number states ignored President's calls ""open up"". avoided even worse disaster ignoring President United States.

Let sink in. 2020. Trump immune. getting better going go away worry.  shitty place shitty things.

Funny nobody cries Reddit hates china every thread touches china remotely ""fuck China"" top post. brainwashed idiots like think US fucking many ways. sound like kid getting tetanus shot told wear shoes outside 100 times crying mom never told could step nail. Fauci TOLD US TIME TIME didn’t listen. Can't second/third wave can't get first one. *taps head* Looking forward tik tok entertainment. Thanks insight, Corpse-Fucker! Unfortunately, ruled states (including mine) can’t get court alter arrangements parental custody. Agreements made two parties “we different views safe practices covid” alter custody. non-custodial parent thinks “covid hoax” still demands weekend visits every two weeks... child get exposed. Stay safe friend! good reason, there's lot hate lol Wrong. mother doctor. would never cry work front patients. That’s crazy unprofessional stupid fucking rally. Good luck that. Hope there's spare ventilator available ""healthy"" family needs one (or four). 

Everyone vulnerable. precisely reason control now. learn ""live it"", keep great! relative  mother child could easily prevented this. Definitely mostly giving heads up. Right, numbers higher that. means worse nothing. Idiot fucking tsunami exactly locked 2.5% population officially infected, positivity rate 50% months now, certainly least 10 times that?

There difference declaring lockdown actually implementing one.

There way real lockdown level spread. Please winnings thanks trump. Imagine needing vaccine something barley killing anyone lmao. Shit joke. Still waiting get scary coronavirus. Pathetic He’s also likely gonna stoke ACA week election.  America FDA already approved use convalescent plasma emergency use authorization (EUA). still using unproven therapy? feel like 9th grade science told something happens waves happen top anyone else remember? Lmao clearly know zero doctors ex either really stupid plain scumbag.

Edit: Also hope GF feels better soon remain symptom free. Feel free head r/coronavirus lots people currently going recovered would happy answer questions may have. believing science way make magic happen brotha. funny post one demonstrates complete lack understanding herd immunity actually Young fit people likely completely asymptomatic. It’s ~80% level 18-40 believe. kid’s mother pretty messed telling son likely exposed COVID-19 ELI5 forced indoors cold contribute virus spread? Well yes. I'm saying miracle could picked something else used brains unlike anyone Trump admin. That's true...

**EDIT**

OMG is... LOL! Got me! Good job eating propaganda. Haha, clever. mean like else: 

your grandma dead... 
your mama dead... 
your daddy dead... 
your cousin dead... 

If doesn’t convince mask mandate necessary, else would? “a lot people” would dead got lost conversation? America going ask hold beer Orange Menace sticks it. remember total count hit 1 million crazy me. Still didn’t answer question, want save lives? u/ArcticRedwood mean? I’m Texas 100 hospital don’t ICU beds anymore. covid floor double roomed. step become new regular ICU COVID soon well. remember going stages idiocy

To fair, many potential pandemics (SARS, MERS, swine flu, ebola, etc.) come absolutely nothing disrupted globe like COVID. understand people brag ""they totally saw coming January"" - bet mention pandemics thought would come fruition didn't.  pretty sure hate china usa right lads? Wouldn’t winter keep people inside? mean, fair, Covid changed world way seen since world war two. think fault predicting that. seen dozens scary new viruses flare die even last 20 years. 

That said, ass laughing you, that's unprofessional Standing waves nobody’s left standing? mean, rich, structured community loophole idiots anti-intellectuals thrive?

You underestimate bad schools are. places schools funded local taxes, meaning rich great schools inner city rural schools screwed. Civics education gutted really matter anyways, since half country worships ideal rugged individualism never really existed. ...kinda US. Trump sucks, hilarious seeing people think control what, say, Wisconsin coronavirus. going freeze rent mortgages?

They could, people like Mitch McConnell actually soul.

But happens vote republican. get criminal cabal blows resources supposedly richest country world, giving away tax breaks people wealthy lit 90% wealth fire, would still wealth know with. No. mean, according study. leaving hospital 5 days sooner would otherwise, presumably that’s due reduction symptoms. Symptoms longer severe enough require hospitalization. homelander know, it’s due both. said, there’s sizable chunk population that’s responsible due beliefs, ranging young people thinking they’re invincible, republicans thinking it’s hoax, anti-mask Karen’s. Pretty sad state reality Hey that’s me! I’m one new cases! think I’ll get write foreword new guinness book world records now?! honor! Ahhh America. always first everything. Sounds like excuses. Trump failed. Things getting better due crisis mismanagement. Kobe died January Remember Austin powers 1 million dollars used big deal someone have? Seems like something broken mean guess certain point either die won't. determine level risk, determine theirs. 

There's many fucking people anyway Don’t forget grandma 83, copd, diabetes! surly covid took sweet sweet grams out! Currently living Korea! fucking dream. 

I really admire Koreans ability mask get it. lived America since 2006 I'm thinking might leave Asia life experience. course Korea downsides negligible face 2020. trump said it’s control lmao feel like could probably invaded pretty easily couple months. guess easily, overwhelming force several waves someone really wanted to. Although we'd clearly nuke world oblivion point. Anyway, good night? right. I'm sick winning. YEP. either charge fines, make refuse wear masks dig grave fallen. Yeah worked 50 years Remember said would done Easter? Circle indeed. totally american pandemic. (Europe much worse)

You kinda prove point americans indeed, stupid. like South Park episode keep trying lose little league games go home enjoy summer. Nobody going wear masks year vaccine comes out, mandate not. don’t disagree, I’m referring India. much lower per capita rate. Yup, waaaaay lowballed it. defense back first week March. COVID measures taken individual country level basis within EU, though many states work together neighbors coordinate timing.

The EU power speed make anything substantial happen time crisis like decisions made days weeks basis. thing they've related COVID negotiations loans aid spending countries. back spring. HIGHLY recommend going drug store getting Mucinex DM (or generic, used CVS). helped tremendously. long entire country infected infected least once? saw seatbelt laws worked out... Goddamnit Get rid crybaby pussies honestly can’t put piece cloth face 15 minutes Target It’s wild ride since then, Nah man sure fuck could keep going like another year two means one else know go shit virus puts through.

If shut shit correctly start wouldnt ""keep going like this,"" least could stay fuck inside months. 1. May document

#5 month old scientific paper

**2.** Worldwide estimations, god damn reality based what's happened.

Do mental backflips, jackass. deserve ridiculed. studies, placebo group SIDE EFFECTS drug group(remdesivir, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, etc.

Sometimes placebo another drug, like currently approved standard care. one point hydroxychloroquine considered standard care treating Covid. 

Other times it’s harmless substance like sugar pill (except research studies diabetes). appeared little odd/off first debate. hindsight wonder already treated (steroids....) Obama US disease control specialist monitor placed various places throughout china. one wuhan. trump made sure post longer filled. Thin that's bad luck?

If Hillary won, would current pandemic. remember following china locked 10m people built hospital days fair, far likely closer hundred thousand cases point, almost nobody able get tested. seeing hundreds dead people per day. even winter yet risk N95 mask shortage medical professionals guidance buy turned wear mask turned masks work. I’m sure angry. Regardless, everyone Covid gets tested. infection numbers depend voluntary testing, severe cases get tested actual ER. dividing deaths infections isn’t accurate.

Have good evening. need administration capable coming scientifically backed plan, like rest fucking world already done. Oh, BLM protests, people properly socially distanced wore masks, mask protests white conservatives brought automatics. number people wearing masks definitely increasing here.

My wife went pick'n'save grab whiskey drown sorrows surrounded people self checkout without masks on. 

We picked furthest register maskless family inbred yocals, another chose register directly next us. really keeping hospitals crashing vaccine and/or therapeutics. suspected ebb flow day came, people really seem collectively thrown towel now. Except specifically want prevent teen pregnancies.  desperate poor base... fuck would limit base ANYTHING reduce population desperate poor. else murder brown people them? needs sieze means protection! IHME model says 280,000 per day end year things go way they're going now. Get ready, we're wild-ass ride. wasted initial quarantine, early surge lessons. wasted time prepare second wave cases fell, someone hates masks wears know they're important, huge problem logic vast majority people know handful people got diagnosed COVID fine weeks later. 

You can't play extreme ""UR GONNA DIE"" card months end when, reality is, overwhelming (over 99%) people 50 contract disease fine. shameful goes traditional American values Republicans claim hold dear. lost respect Republican party. population density India seems like nightmare Coronavirus. hope enough population listens scientist dies eventually. think hope vaccine unfrotunately.. otherwise disastrous herd immunity strategy option left. Yikes Whoa wish button downvoting everything person ever said... Million people dead ::Shrugs shoulders:: is. people remember. swappening late March Assholes. found mom taking sister theme park tomorrow. Guess rollercoasters worth rolling dice Ah yes... beforetimes never going happen even places took seriously second wave want save lives? still anti-mask freakouts happening, largely quieted down? Tbh, kind miss them, bewilderingly manic. check brain said big ""no way"". could sworn two years ago.  anonymous token apps people download contact someone may infected, send notice. I’m statistically recovered. I’m still heart/lung issues extreme fatigue though. statistics don’t tell whole story. 

Glad you’re fine. lot people talk South America things seem going awful according look death rate Mexico. Many South American countries topping infection charts too.

Many countries Asia well either although poorer ones seem absent top charts pretty convinced that's either reporting issue due poverty many traveled out.

I'm sure Africa getting accurate reporting spread badly far, due less travel.

It's easy pigeon-hole news USA Europe getting worse rest world suffering badly more. places seem limited damaged fairly successfully like rich Asian countries i.e South Korea, China, Japan well island nations like New Zealand. 

42.5 million cases. Insane think about. ~0.54% world population less year, that's reported cases. totally forgot Jared's frat bro squad (sad lol) Doppler effect, shit train keeps blasting ahead shooting tracks infront it. .... GF took Ibuprofen nothing .. guess know better scientists! choice. groups helped us reach point. Americans hearing stories hospitals near “breaking point” nothing else.

Until cross threshold start refusing care bodies start stacking burn piles one believe care.  saw Trump tell America debate rounding corner...biggest increase record seem anywhere near rounding corner. Someone must confused, could be? prisons full. way this'll work. I'm sorry, america, according **GOD DAMNED MATH** 2.7% fatality rate. 

That due poor leadership poor national healthcare. Want round 3%? want accept reality? Nah.  really isn't. 
 
Are really ignorant? think people hate America dumb shit like using metric measurements? 
 
You don’t think it’s got anything slavery, genocide, imperialism, globalisation exploiting weak economies, warmongering, warcrimes, chemical warfare, neo-colonialism, assassinations, terrorism, espionage... etc etc? 
 
You sound utterly brain dead declaring there’s reason hate America. 
 
Have ever seen list countries America created aided coups in? 
  
 
Do know US fabricating propaganda enter wars? [Nayirah [Gulf Yes that’s right, literally created atrocity propaganda emotionally manipulate American public calling wars killed millions people, admitted so, saying they’ve done “no wrong”. 
 
Stop dumb American stereotype. world hates America good reasons. anitmaskers love guns much think fitting. Well. Take Italy alone. see spike [Citation needed]  Get finger pulse oximeter you’re riding home. Take several readings throughout day. get pattern 94 SpO2 call doctor first consider going in. Make sure stay hydrated fevers. Best luck you. family simply taking seriously. They're going day nothing wrong. asked visit Thanks Giving took offense refused. simply donning piece cotton face could single handedly end crime suffering earth bring second coming Jesus christ.  news, Big Ten football back! Stacked schedule today! Europe still winning! Organised crime benefits massively national lockdowns.

Camorra isn’t backing protestors, they’re backing De Luca still early draw conclusions think, perhaps worry Sweden might bit less so?. 

We're pretty fine considering, personally issue express relatives want long travel, visit stay christmas. ye co worker got last week, 2 told stay home worked him, lost wage ._.  working better places them. rise cases idiot Trumpist rural areas don’t take virus seriously don’t kind mandates. Long time Billings resident here. surrounded anti mask idiots. friends work billings clinic, got direct line nurses working w/ covid patients here. going get much worse. Stay safe. grew rural America. Whenever saw articles crying death rural America, I'd roll eyes. small towns rural areas die people ignorant stubborn. feels like people never dealt rural America finally seeing like. next time read sob story hardship rural americans face, remember people outright refused wear masks stop spread deadly disease pandemic. Yeah expected, small lockdown almost cases better chance providing cures amazing health system.

20k cases Germany way different 20k cases South Italy Spain. US needs get 500k/day equal countries country right (adjusted population). Lot European countries deep shit right now. guessing others catch weather gets colder. retarded!  Unless intends start paying me, fuck right off. remember virus started closing job talking manager going big deal. told already shut countries, ignorant would within 6 months year. thought people would take seriously, wear masks told.

Oh, wrong was. Yeah nobody waiting then. outrage would enormous. Well supporters turning them. side can’t motivate it’s people mobilize, even despite this, blame? negligent ones enablers? gotta stop testing 'turn corner' virus start opening ~~death traps~~, uh, meant meat production facilities. What? working took pic checking someone in. 
I'd stay home could. Germany 1 case company meeting big deal. MS causes transverse Myelitus (spinal inflammation) along lesions optic nerve brain. MS can't diagnosed antibody test, instead requires reviewing MRI specific oligoclonal bands. vaccine triggering MS, ticking time bomb certain people, unknown whether cause. definitely least 2 cases TM. third questionable since Johnson Johnson transparent. ? truth referring to? referring alluded different comment different person pointing people’s perception kills actually does.

If so, read article posted? that's article says. article (which based online survey mere 10,000 people) purports people survey misunderstand mortality risk virus based age group. Apparently people underestimate deadly age groups 55 older, overestimate deadly age groups younger that. That's it. article also says:

""While risk death COVID-19 minimal among younger people, health experts warn coronavirus pandemic increasingly driven people young 20 30 may symptoms all, pose danger much vulnerable elderly population."" don’t think they’ve anywhere America then, maybe outside NY.  allergy nasal sprays affect rapid test results? God, 5%?? truly going die We’re going oval. Every months, curve flattens out, begin feel confident, go around sharp turn. Lmao website ,graphs stats get C highschool country. go ahead believe lies want. mask mandate US probably won’t work better France, Italy Spain. 

Give good reason would. mean, reality. theory. problem cases families got together nothing bad came it, well, none probably virus begin with. one contagious? Sincence lot time even know asymptomatic carriers, that's practicing proper social distancing, avoiding gatherings, etc still important.  every city lockdown

every city, small town, village lockdown Sweden Germany found different yet winning formula seems

I think might want go look steep daily new cases graph Germany right now.    hope Jan. 20, 2021 noon ET someone this. believe overwhelming majority human race nice caring people. Even Nazi Germany, majority Germans nice decent people. Unfortunately, ones guns. People general used illness. media always reports leaving hospital moment victory, person fully healthy back normal. much true. guys! We’re rounding corner. gone day now! cases increase faster fatalities, logically would obviously case people get infected much easily dying it, CFR always decreasing there's new wave? Soon newly infected fatalities CFR start climbing again, no? literally none things?? He’s far road denying. back tracks shows slightest remorse, he’s done. It’s actually fascinating sociology study. grocery store work (the one that's owned richest guy planet) store meeting recently. telling us still expecting amount customers last year, more. 

Our current covid measures pretty laid back. Company wide mandate masks. But, told higher ups store, still ""complicated issue"" ask customers wear mask see them.

Tend work 8-12hrs days 5days week. current count, see daily average 12 mask less customers around 300 transactions day. Highest count 25 mask less customers one day. easily see 3-4 times much traffic holidays. 

Please pray team. can't everyone stay hone drinking watching tv like me...? 

Oh right need money - gov help pls? Back quarantine started said thought going two weeks. pretty sure gonna three four months. family called Debbie Downer said way. suspected right thought masks started getting politicized. 

This nightmare want wake up. I'm pretty sure remember similar estimates like months ago except ""by end year"", pushed back February Ah see attended Trump University! times That’s incredible. takes lot really embrace deep self-examination. hope ability never lose it. Yeah... started watching movies/shows last months feels surreal someone goes crowd inside building without mask aunt died last week week ICU. Caught church. inferiority complex what? argument schools  Yes. Yes is. step cousin Downs absolutely adored me. lucky job McDonald’s completely sweet guy. disease cruel. USA filled brim arrogant self centered uneducated fools. fall narratives media social circles believe think like dont reason exist. absolutely maddening sane person going USA right now. wish people could come senses realize team bigger problems coming way global warming. people power need uneducated people vote hold everyone down. wealth gap insane keps getting worse this. hope big changes coming. I've always optimist. maybe Principal Skinner meant said steamed clams old family recipe change this. VOTE.  inlaws going pissed sing Happy Birthday Jesus.

Pretty sure Jesus would ok trying spread pandemic, hey know? went walk coffee, wearing mask, know produce fuck lot moisture face cold. That's certainly debatable. would jam one federally enumerated powers. reckon Commerce Clause would used justify anything like that. Right back atcha 👍🏼 I'd debate maintaining social distancing easy actually one hardest things is. two simple though. Large gatherings fine though. outbreaks linked protests, including anti-lockdown protests.  Oh stay healthy!!  Well Biden already said won’t lockdown predict it’ll repeats today vaccine rolled out. polite way say ""Hey, asshole, might want call friends hung with, might take us days you.""

Source: know least one assholes never bothered tell half daily contacts got COVID July. Thank God live halfway across country. Boy got news Trump... destruction world's economy killing people world ages. putting profits people. OP, rural area, people STILL calling ""just flu."" People fucking, aggressively stupid unreal. Ask Chris Christie spent week hospital even best medical care possible... body else name would bully. certain person name calling believe scientific fact. mean, multitudes people pleading Trump *exact things* since March. GOP controlled Senate *refusing* even *hold vote* bill would directly help us this. 

They care. Trump care. one turnaround change heart. start pleading directly citizens own. It’s pain ass remove mask put mask every minute pass someone by... ***STACK LAYERS*** Look us really turning corner... didn’t say Easter he? ha, USA need NUMBA ONE everything, gotta beat everyone else!!! 

WE going 6 digit 100,000 case DAY. LETS GO! USA USA USA.


^^^^Itsajoke Man that'd great.

Plus got booster years ago. I’m American Vietnam.

I don’t really talk friends West anymore. It’s okay though I’m tired worrying people think acknowledge masks work, “everything can”. it’s masks didn’t work, Trojan horsed. trying asshole post kind came like that. can’t wait either. disgusting human tbh. agree. thank you. hope well. whole thing insane. Ugh, cousin SD, huge Harley fan. probably went Sturgis, know finally got blocked calling racist bullshit. Herd immunity reasonably achievable without vaccine. There’s well 300 million people country 8 million caught far. 230,000 people already died it. can’t count stupid people spreading infection. reach almost us can’t something stop slow Watched borat 2 today. footage republican convention. Pence mentions usa 15 cases, ready take on. Shit aged like unvaccinated child. Fuck Republicans. Lmao that's exactly read Well wear mask outside either, unless see group people out. usually happens cross street. 

I meant wear mask go store public places. almost gave fuck. one ridiculous view here. Diabetes perfectly manageable disease, grandma catches virus dies fragile, still virus killed her. died diabetes time died virus. fact comorbidities make death acceptable. I’ve caught enough colds airlines say “you first”. least US alone. without reimplemented lockdown  FrEeDuMs!!  times Yeah universal basic income stay inside stop interacting humans forever. Yayy! Pandemic fatigue setting majorly. comes point people cant anymore. seeing Western World. Thank fighting good fight providing facts. Case fatality rate somewhere 2% range right now, still scary. keep parroting line 5% vs 0.5% warrants different response, bet they'll different response ever hits 5%, happened certain locations hospitals can't handle number cases. act like million people dead write off... large corner arguing medical costs US high, agree you. hand, we're talking people good insurance plans. Rounding corner, hill really outed me. I’m ashamed want president speak coherently. Mmm. There’s truth that. I’m inclined toward feeling occasional despair reminding things aren’t over, trying best vigilant safe rather bury head sand hope things don’t get scary. don’t spend time reading what’s happening political sphere. check absorb remind life still crazy. It’s personal opinion ignore something makes easier forget it’s affecting many people. folks know decided want part what’s going also tend ones taking less less precautions. try remind sources points. it’s personal. one make look something don’t want to. That's terrible, like all. Back July choice hospital put open heart surgery patients right next covids, room still way close comfort. 

There's going lot innocent victims end. hope mom okay. # 1 Holy fuck ... Wave check midst madness, I'm one person angrily venting awful therapist. 

Fuck you, Kathryn. USA! USA! USA! No, knew much conservative me, put mildly. also basically second parents owe small part them.

It is.   Cancer? see sub on? know medical insurance is? What's wrong brain? always wonder Biden campaign isnt making use [this article wrote coming late January. *“To blunt, concerned Trump administration’s shortsighted policies left us unprepared dangerous epidemic come sooner later.“* show, refuse open doors. Goodbye,usa.

Your leaders failed you. scared universal Healthcare.i hope ok like...yall fucked. Vote better.  Well yeah. it’s late much anything. Hopefully end January things change. Genuine question. Argentina locked since March hasnt worked them? aunt died last week. Infected church. fucking church members singing hospital died, *course* attended funeral. Idiots, them. poor aunt well. Goddamnit, fucking unnecessary. Deaths tracked. Excess deaths amount deaths averagely expected.

Say given month 10k people die average US. Well last 10 months average 28.5k people died.

(These exact numbers, example explain excess death statistics work)

Its statistics. way things rocketed week, think pretty much lock next week (not speaking doctor here, someone looking worldometers) think less people would dying less people getting virus first place due proper safety?  Vaccinations available. people choices well can. thing, many people North Dakota event? think like sinus curve need delay second wave bit order cancel first one! tremendously brilliant. would Governors enforce it. way force Governors pull federal assistance state. want federal aid combat COVID? Mandate enforce masks. Refuse get assistance. mean, find quite reasonable family, I'm increasingly finding minority. Yes, prepared absolutely nothing people arent needlessly dying lack hospital equipment overcrowding...

People still needlessly dying due people infected due incompetent handling pandemic. curious, friend's tune now? That's works, gets stop mingling, silver lining save lives? silver lining? 🤷‍♀️ It’s safe....as long nobody around infected. already form mask mandate 49 states campaign advertising get behind Rounding turn! gradient lines charts Midwest South 2 now. going vertical. stock technical analysts, charts bullish, bad. Hospitalizations lag case totals weeks. today's highest daily number cases, hospitalizations expected surge. wear surgical mask top work dispose leave office. change gloves patients. also glasses (instead contact lens) protect eyes. far one clinic got infected Covid. one allowed wait clinic. Patients wait parking lot. everyone wears mask like people Asia, many cases. didn’t think standoffish all.

This sub I’m verified others don’t want need. Reddit build reputation participating frequently getting upvotes.

I think general public becoming sceptical scientists general, shame.

There many, many people working tirelessly find solutions Covid. making huge sacrifices. need work together. Even forum. ""I want football/baseball/movies/haircut/shopping want RIGHT NOW!""

also 


""I'm wearing fucking mask! FrEeDoM!!!""

Wear mask. Wash hands. Stay 6ft apart. forget football... Keeping America Great, usual last 4 years.


Really hoping die painlessly suddenly lot often entire life. Breaking many records national, personal level. can’t wait come back sub 2022 see weird lunatics still saying “we won’t normal life 2145” Indy 500 first corner done. Thanks Trump. yes, clearly need they're testing /s March 237th me. big secret Trump wants undo everything Obama pure spite hatred man Obama made fun him. Combine inability/refusal fully staff executive branch bungled response crisis practically guaranteed. every crisis, seems. genuinely imagine absolute sack shit going television saying ""Well, always predicted 1-2 million deaths..."" French friend lives one islands SEA. pandemic started tried utmost go back France well, developing nation. island locked finally able get flight May. Now, want comeback. said ""we're turning corner"", say corner. fatality rate 2.7%

That's odds getting 5 dollars 1 dollar scratch ticket. great comment. parents already suffering pandemic fatigue. keeps might wear mask I'm them. meet anymore. claim area fine mostly safe already board game neighbors without masks. feel safe spending time parents anymore. means finally cross “War Christmas” liberal agenda. think point governments multiple countries waiting vaccine, country people areny listening rules government soft ( imo ). say sick winning! also need remember much much better treating virus, hospital stays considerably shortened happened Spring.

Citation? Death quicker outcome recovery. Forever debt thankful service contributions societies experts, professionals whose knowledge insight critical invaluable. feel like winter, that's going kind everybody. realistic isolate years thought gonna disappear like miracle according leadership places well now. make broad generalizations country that's 4 million square miles. death rates? I’m pretty sure matters more. NPR shows INCREDIBLE progress. mean op says used masks still got like masks aren’t effective.   We're number one!
We're number one!
We're number one! mean... sound like fairly decent reason. It’s reality, dystopian pipe dream know it’s fashionable blame Trump entire world seeing huge spikes. state live fairly liberal, see almost everyone closed spaces wearing masks numbers spiking.

Unfortunately guess much could enforcing medical n95 think practical restriction fine with: measures would involve authoritarian policies I’m favor like shutting gatherings, spying citizens contact tracing restrictive policies make uncomfortable long term implications. next four months may one hardest periods life. century type event.  
By next spring, much scientific data immunity, Covid-19 morbidity mortality, better treatments testing, even possibly licensed vaccine.

But first need get winter. I'm sorry. hope Dad recovers fully. r/rareinsults USA!! USA!! USA!! I'm sorry loss. Maybe 5-10% people Helen GA wearing mask October Fest. can’t believe what’s seeing vs even TN it’s 25%-75% mask wearing observations. quebec half canadas deaths? northern Italy hard hit compared south?

By time sweden/norway/denmark ""locked down"" (very similar ""reduction"" timing go phone data) sweden 3x cases denmark 5x cases norway (estimation deaths 2 weeks later). coupled fact got point many swedens regions many cases trace accouns less whole difference.  find that? 2k deaths per day? 

Just shut dude, making wide 2022 “normal life 2056” Italy went reason I'm compliant masks go nowhere except work, grocery store, outside fresh air.

You mean generously cherry-picked part Italy shone reddit's face make seem like everything ok?

No European nation coped Coronavirus without massive issues. making heard Italy now. Also known “rounding corner”. wealthy US corrupted institutions universities serve thier interests extension, interests children. concentrated? always find really strange numbers like northeast theres barely anything. Normal life coming back 2022, believe won’t denial Correction: deaths ""all time high"" +90% MoM trending sharply up. Every state region trajectory. Trump administration slowing testing controlling number reports Really? state mid atlantic, cases flat. Yeah he’s got nothing, it’s whole lot nothing. ermm plans deaths, case fatality rate Lol really said I'm right youre wrong. 

Lol  Pretty sure bat long dead digested now.  can't serious, think 83,000 fine? look information available, i.e. hospitals collapsing third time year.

And information coming from? western media reporting anonymous sources, western experts, dissident groups agenda? 

When comes reporting countries America considers enemies, like Iran, China, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, etc. skeptical reporting western media general. Deaths down, hospitalizations down. cares number cases? slowed spread, hospitals capacity, we're good now. much depth telling tested positive. Contact tracers also go quarantine isolation protocols bunch informational stuff average person know, mention also asking contacts contacts piecing everything together. yea ridiculous they're telling people themselves, best case essentially useless worst case people spreading around incorrect info need most.  really best everything use term, “before plague” work. “Fuck poor. (But make ‘em believe they’re fucked folks dark skin.)”

Literally every one policies, including Covid. Someone PA ticketed taking drive March lmao enforced Score people   Take upvote sonofabitch additional likely preventable. Generally speaking, people evacuate hurricane. stay (to meet friends bars) likely make outcome worse. Short term supply shortages natural consequence disaster, manufacturer plans doomsday scenario. sure you’re getting at.  going recently actually. consistent getting worse according data yesterday. 

Still Highest deathrate world.  I’m sure you’ll feel way President Biden. Nice try trying argue random person Reddit. stand statement. Thanks. magnetic yellow ribbons still thing countries Jesus, keeping new cases US. Last saw maybe like 15,000. live work Korea too!

I remember flying back States visit family around late February. extra precautions SF airport, everyone checked temperature, report symptoms, social distance Incheon. [""Like freaky Even Pandemic Japan low obesity rates much healthier population long lifespan compared many countries world. plus believe ""collective good"" would explain they're much better countries care personal freedoms enough wear masks thus infect innocent people. get wont need vaccine.  “The death one tragedy, death millions STA-TIS-TIC!” - Marilyn Manson, Fight Song idiots love nascar  FYI Australia 112 cases past week. USA 200 times new infection rate per capita Australia. SSBM commentator ""A NEW RECORD!"" definitely plan kidnap governors want wear masks. That’ll definitely make things better. 

/s know nothing doctors. way mom one Nothing going happen. fine. illegal many people asymptotic gotten tested though?

Aren’t like 80% people get without symptoms? Remember fires Australia? 2020. hospital COVID inpatients we’ve ever know we’re one. Ok Kyle. 

Not sure districts doing. remote agreement, us. There's reimbursement costs associated teaching home. 

Since year started, I've replaced modem router. I've buy second lap top trying run everything laptop making crash. 

I still print reports, activites, etc. daily. Paper, ink, printer, I've purchased. already replace parts wore out. 

There's teachers work using cell phones hot spots works better internet. replaced router, modem &amp; computer times use phone run classes. pay overage / penalty cell company, job. 

This situation bad around. I've got kids home trying virtual school work. see hard too. saying easier teachers working we're teaching home really shows sat see virtual teaching really like.  Biden getting handed pandemic,
a decimated economy, decimated bureaucracy (CDC), gigantic deficit go along it. That's people saying cases deaths going reopening. different time? 2020 80 30. people wearing masks around close family members last four months? sort suspect would typical thing families now. take doctor's word many clinical trials. 
But again, studies flawed start. 
How studies, placebo group SIDE EFFECTS drug group(remdesivir, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, etc.  
You can't placebo group showing side effects almost twice much non placebo group.  
And can't chance either.  Damn, that’s impressive. cut May 1, 2020. Gave one full month, realized everything completely pointless would continue spread mass years come regardless measures don’t take said “fuck it”. even flew Albania (one places could find still open) week get away bit. get 1/10,000 shot getting hospitalized. fuck supposed let dominate life? ....all people give shit couple weeks,lol. hear Homer saying ""so far"".

For reference, Belgium population 11.5 million people remember China nation wide shutdown around Chinese New Year nearly factories closed weeks (I following progress Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory).

I think blunted spread enough could reallocate large percentage medical staff outside Hubei province assist Hubei Wuhan especially. Almost like global pandemic pretty miniscule rate death.

Lucky people living caring civilised country. Nice, thanks info!! 2020: every day lasts week, every week lasts day. I've working whole time, imagine mindfuckery people stuck home.

For real, day started, already feels like eternity over. instance last got paid week half ago could easily convince day yesterday. I've literally gotten surprise paychecks covid know day week two full weeks passed since last one. Get up, go work, sleep, repeat. know joked before, really like inspired activities fit those, especially manager who's totally burned burden understaffing. Boyfriend joked getting Switch started, Switches gone, we're thankful ""waste"" money something literally time anyway (neither jobs furloughed us, literally afford quarantine). you’re not. You’re showing care too. It’s two way street. parents brother jobs routinely come contact strangers, still go work in-person 2 days week. means none us ensure 2 week quarantine equates holidays year. Oh weird, virus causes illness severely effects obese people ravaging country world jokes morbidly obese.... yeah government's fault protect .5 micron virus, fault protect myriad health issues, covid included, eating trash lazy piece shit brings about. Pay wall... Dues article mention go deciding unrelated? Flattening curve stop hospitals overwhelmed. risk many, many people dying due people unable treated all. Lol. Medical debt still number one bankruptcy cause US.

I know tell this, 60 percent families country financially ruined even one member gets cancer, thats family member lives. Fuck, dude. That's rough. Sorry hear guys going due carelessness. Fingers crossed speedy recovery! states already mask mandates cases still rising.

I don’t know people think federal mandate do? I’ve developed nice little dependency panic meds dissociative panic attacks due covid. fucking blows dude rookie numbers, Belgium (11mil people) touched 16k last week. Going 20k daily! watched video tiktok college students packed street party don’t think go back tiktok Dear God. GW Obama back please?   can't fix stupid! unfortunately doesn’t cover freedom *from* stupid. best solution slow testing. sounds awful. I'm sure kids would enjoy watching getting jabbed every month too. hoax!   Lies thought France bad... well still cause France much smaller mom guilts spending time her. restaurant work packed non wask wearing people every day. smoke cigarettes already smokers cough. waiting kinds stimulus bill cause Republicans. hate everything. social life board games pretty hard set game nights right now. Everything awful.  spread misinformation? deaths? deaths going up? Curious I'm American fucking hate America. I'm embarrassed born shithole, tacky-ass racist country. American love left country especially four years delusional, racist idiot. aren’t testing well right either Lol 12% contraction... whatever billionaires survive?!?! one case. three cases two separate trials two different vaccines companies transparent going on, actually understand lose billions honest. vaccine causing transverse myelitus per se, vaccine triggering auto immune response causes inflammation spine, optic nerve, and/or brain, reeks havoc CNS. known yet, believed, either something genetic something underlying makes certain people susceptible active immune system. pharmaceutical companies could research fix problem, disease considered rare, instead focus whatever makes money people continue pay consequences reaction various types vaccines (Flu, HPV, Tetanus, etc potentially covid). Well, different situation Covid billions potentially get vaccinated short period time potentially rushed. 30000 took vaccine Astrazeneca trial 15000 got placebo, that's 2 15000 got Transverse Myelitus. Thats much, much higher normal percentage people normally get diagnosed transverse myelitus. Extrapolate 6 billion people that's theoretically 866,000 people could end Transverse Myelitus. Think second. There’s excuse wear mask properly. know what’s going world almost year this. don’t wear mask you’re telling you’re ignoring almost years’ worth science data Rofl give fuck America. wish could ban antimaskers able get hospital care, forever. literally anti maskers fault current situation. Fuck trump every single one supporters. Yall Americans anymore eyes. Yep. US competent enough get wave 1 yet. chart going backflip? catch once.

No cant. literally handful cases dubious evidence best.

Why would sit type last sentence? idea, arent part this, literally nothing back besides non-peer reviewed articles google up.

So leave 'wear mask times'? How? even cops wear masks. They’re hard breathe of, conceal half face PITA carry around time.

Only one three items true. you’re going pretend existing cases someone confirmed tests positive? virus known asymptomatic large percentage infected? 

The true death rate include asymptomatic people never got test reason think needed test. can’t take conformed deaths divided confirmed cases get true death rate virus asymptomatic often. 

The CDC estimates survival 99.4%... believe scientists? place in-laws. sister law lax sucks can’t see nieces wife’s parents one person family dropping ball. Totally selfish. put jawn wawa, that's need know. Since Phase 4 estimated April presume think normal life closer think year started Trump assassinating Iranian general Don’t worry, 6 months gets hot it’ll go away! Speaking safety mom's basement. Two weeks working means certain death hunger many countries. think need context here.

The governor one went viral flamethrower video.
The point first lockdown prevented significant spread italy, Naples included. guy, governor region, gained lot visibility that. recently reelected huge margin taking advantage good covid numbers ""i sheriff town"" attitude. lockdown imposed central government, playing bad cop someone else saved region.

Now fast forward month soon cases rise two days starts yelling situation critical, disaster, starts making fun halloween, still treating citizens kids starts imposing strict measures.

It turns given resources never increased ICUs much expected. mayor Naples got news stricter measures decided governor live interview tv course blamed guy never ever discuss decision anybody.

Did people protest? No. speak mayors, might failed prepare still imposes stricter rules. people complain.

A couple days raises bar. Another video showing someone's x-rays announces wants full hard lockdown 30 40 days, regardless central government, mayors kind economical impact might people.

At point surprise people might get little upset guy protest regional government building. France got like 42000 today absolute record, proportional one know re-infection thing right? 
 
The virus widespread multiple strains developing anti-bodies one doesn’t stop catching another strain. 
  
 special thing case time hospitalized, doctors sequenced genome virus infected him. slightly different one infection next, suggesting virus mutated -- changed -- 4 months infections. also proves it’s possible coronavirus infect person twice. going new health revolution every 100 years? person you’re responding to, also living Korea February everybody knew back home states telling come home. wasn’t safe Korea. couple teachers school moved back midway contracts fear it. 

Looking back now, it’s surreal think mindset versus now. Korea handled well anyone could, US... said? office planned head back January. 

See ya next summer! that’s extra click. Kinda kind double bounced trampoline instead launched air laughing stop breathing die nations still it. Look India high 97K/day early September, 54K. Stay course keep fight. Indian Prime Minster made rallying cry people let guard people head holiday season.

Don't let Covid fatigue set here(US) well. Churches good,

Here Korea, churches nothing cults. several high ranking church leaders we've arrest continue sermons despite told they're longer allowed to. course there's Shincheonji type people quite literally cults purposefully spread coronavirus churches throw blame onto churches.

Throw 'em prison two week quarantine, say. say corner... ever heard phrase 'an ounce prevention saves pound cure'? listened experts scientists massive problem currently have. may sound bit weird almost reminds time seemed pass younger, day quick, week forever, months seemed span decades worth time That’s got real hope stays way you. I’m stuck Republican “open matter what” hell. 97.2% survival rate? emperor dump said would go away 2 weeks 7 months ago... honest question: friends ever give indication racist married wife? I’m Black I’ve heard several white friends claim one ex-friends said something racist dropped them. works—you’re completely blindsided friend’s racism? Republican pride like game telephone except instead uttering silly phrase last guy dies.  1 guy plane china fucking cares. What’s math many record breaking numbers every citizen gets lose significant amount lives? lol  I'm American would absolutely love test subject first volunteer opportunity arises. live alone, mom lives state, see dad week most, sister passed January, see grandma holidays, kids, 2.5 weeks vacation saved up. give single fuck getting it. Best case, immune; worst case, get die, know dead cares. could also get immune recover, since I'm active 30 year old drink smoke cigarettes. vape nicotine &amp; THC, smoke flower times week, though. statistically, I'll fine.  80/20 rule - 20% people responsible 80% stupidity.

Every nation 20%, American 20% tend louder prouder. Totally control Maybe following advice giving Chinese January caught middle pandemic. work lawful, ethical, human rights-based interventions entail public health powers tailored specific risks encourage people voluntarily comply possible accomplish legitimate, communal live standards expect others follow. pleading residents? Shouldn’t pleading federal government? president? robust instant testing system set up, people paid stay home, would significantly slow spread. people streets food deliveries volunteers.

If that's takes... Uh, no. caught massive issues part. We're already stacking influenza deaths.

We're 334,000 deaths COVID, Flu, pneumonia spawned either COVID Flu. We're adding 1,000 new deaths day COVID. We'll well 400k New Years. 

And every single one trend lines rising, falling.

We'll 500k end January. lord knows Excess Deaths number then. world , including New Zealand ride back US economy stock market. go red, go red. go up, go 

I boastful, helping keep New Zealand company's afloat even directly healthy 38yo sick 2 days felt fine, I'm really terrified. remember people scared/shocked China number.. one day, total.. isn’t reason. % positive test rate way up. Hopefully people start asking doctors

(Dr. Molina Dr. Marr’s postdoctoral clear: think masks important intervention,” said Bill Hanage, one signatories epidemiologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health. “But paper, is, position able look mask use compared interventions.” Huh? work Google Apple this? Don’t need work w health dept enable state? Still waiting CO too. far. never know might key ingredient ending shit show. require 3000 Americans dying every day virus moving forward beginning February. Shit really bad completely ignored. new copypasta born. People ask France never France doing? I'm cynical person... believe anything... still eyes seem sweating reason, never complain limited life's pandemic 'cause like reassure loved ones everything's ok ok I've already lost family covid want cry 'cause wife arrive home minute want worry her.... Thank Jesus, we've learned live (except 225-300K dead people), we're turning corner, going vanish day like magic! I'm based New York. sites free get tested state residence admitted hospital. health insurance, sites charge hefty fee. rapid testing (15 minutes vs standard 2-3 days) airport time-sensitive purpose costs upwards $100. western world like, quit. ?? think people informed. someone lived NY., want see us anywhere near spring. family members medical field go see therapist stuff dealt with. One friend works nursing homes said never seem many people die flu.  So, think sub pretty much keeps real. supposed free though news stories people getting unexpected bills either mistake testing sites bundling tests like flu. Ah, mean rounding corner concave way convex? Thank Jesus, we've learned live (except 225-300K dead people), we're turning corner, going vanish day like magic! allora non guardarlo tieniti pronto  Feels like happened several *years* ago. pandemic (and insanity year general) totally warped perception time.

2020 Time Dilation Damn Gwyneth Paltrow. Hahahahaha. 
Such unnatractive words 🤣 
Just want, physician praying symptoms go away.

""Dearest lord, please help patient realize orgasms important"" ""For women,.of course"" /s. American courts US highest number COVID cases ever: sleep

American courts someone 1 baggie marijuana: Real shit? close bit, open bit, close bit, open bit... Yeah, never even bother denying California Texas numbers fully updated. 

Los Angeles San Diego county reported. counties texas. Lot rural areas think hoax, mild cases tested. 

They're basically building wide net roping everyone in. see cases, already widespread.  Always two weeks out. Shocking.... Why? We're rounding corner, hear? S/ Thinks ""wins popular vote election"" makes someone pro democracy authortiarian. Cute. Oh okay sorry, mis understood you. light population density. I'd imagine ones similar. Correct. We'll 100k per day Nov 1. virus go away like measles. get vaccines vaccinated mostly protection. COVID19 won’t get eradicated. Wow dumb. Fair point lack evidence China lying, still stand point measures aggressive many countries. Governments don’t want China-style crackdowns population simply wouldn’t comply. read somewhere Anthony fauci said maybe would. consensus herd immunity I’ve read. 500,000 people went biker rally Stugis. went back homes Midwest. surprising all. expected. every year people get sick around time. scared might something else nurse friend told reporting covid hospital gets funding. anyone confirm They're switching ""Sacrifice masters"" campaign otherwise described ""Learning live virus."" Wow, that's going big pay increase actors I'm el paso 100% right. Almost everyone wears mask here, people Juarez dont tend wear mask, especially Juarez. mention people cross literally waiting hours zero social distancing. El Pasoans part following guidelines, even people fort bliss mostly white wearing masks. Yes time testing done ever before? Sweden social distanced rather intensely, close businesses schools. society high compliance population follow recommendations (and tend 'social distance' naturally anyway).

Sweden also lacks big family units southern europe has, people live alone partner/kids, rare live grandparents family members. There's reason Sweden's biggest outbreaks immigrant communities (who often live bigger family units). so, deeply confused comment chain. Calling patients ungrateful telling go WebMD fix cancer sick. know get away talking like that, here.  well becasue cant. people wanna endager life say let them.  fault though. system checks balances place prevent shitty president fucking up. republicans decided unwilling maintain system seeing medical professionals concerned careers disregard oath took result. definitely want constituents get pandemic fatigue say,”well f#€k it.” want us accept avoidable deaths. way say, well people wanted it. It’s great according state it’s 2,061 cases 156,940 tests. 1.3% positive. New York State better right now. Ohio twice hospitalizations month ago. states spikes same. Oh lord North Dakota “OVERUN” guys, they’re saying make sure haven’t gotten anyone sick like normal functioning adult, they’ve actually told responsible something???? children listen msnbc scared virus trace selves?? flu travels kids, family, co-workers onto kids again. C19 follows vectors. hard understand spreads outward manages find people susceptible it? Calma Calma Calma Calma Chameleon? context?

Edit: found it. mocks fact can't hear -_-... headline read ""because restaurant reopenings, indoor dining big COVID risk"" ? antibody test, article says ""PCR"" tests. PCR tests take quite bit longer antibody tests

Yeah know main point. pointing cheaper tests general. Also found PCR test country 35€ 55€ expensive normal antibody test still way cheaper Costco ones. pulled before? *not* see lights behind you? Anyone continues speed faces charges, needs caught. think criminal speeds dangerously reads fines mail? Lol.

So, again, *bad* live person radio speeder determine situation happens, vs camera know anything person went fast. Sounds like code among Karen’s democratically elected

So Hitler. Maybe US see death rate decreasing due high-risk groups getting first batch potentially. Utah, already known one racist places America, showing also hate science. Quarantines lower cases government mounts better response. response mounted(little testing fundamentally, also lack financial support affected), strategy government lockdown itself. global contest everyone loses! Agreed. got hand lol politicians believe science. one politicians would say, ""Sad."" Sigh... gotta get past censorship. post again...

Its sad ask something, show literal evidence exactly asked for, still deny happens...

T discourage using masks. encourages people group high risk groups. thinks silly wear otherwise.

BTW, F telling people wear mask... point science changed. think worn mask sooner set better example? Absolutely! said, done exactly asked now, go fellow supporters tell them, Bigly current studies say wear stuff, please near me, thanks. antigen tests open borders miss lot cases. way get well China strategy. help significantly slow spread since taking large percentage spreaders - even without symptoms - equation. Would really interesting see turns - maybe countries copy approach works. Footprints Parable (revised)

I asked, ""But Jesus, why, darkest hour!, one set footprints sand?""

And Jesus replied, ""You always seem fuck things go take leak!"" Yikes! agree also get it. fact quarantined since MARCH like supposed to. I've worn mask public. Kept son away family. Stayed home.

Its almost 8 MONTHS. No, I'm going bars anything jesus fucking tired. get it. get people right things might give up. Maybe done poorly? Nasal test uncomfortable made want sneeze, that's it. thought throat test second time way worse. read posted Canadians average paid 4k sales tax income tax family income 72k paid 28k taxes. literally plan. part problem. leadershit blame. Well, another civil war horizon. matter time can't hold longer. Can't find article, cool idea. Might work well surge capacity. Right, make means big variation activities people dined didn't.

It mean that. means big variation actives covid-positive negative people. typical police getting choose laws enforce base ones agree ones suit them, effectively complete circumventing entire election process government system representatives deciding laws.

Quite simply, police engage behavior jailed. sub dead aside 100+ people staying still talking need social distance 2747  Since oncologists working covid ward? That's what's weird restrictions. like gives doctors covid patients, hurts people zero benefit. Actually testing free China whenever cases present. Tsingtao 10 million tests week so, free. Back spring, knew start counting many people infected, idea it. knew iceberg asymptomatic people, know 10%, 90%, 99%. approximately April 28, FDA [blanket authorized available antibody tests could start getting data (I'm sure that's correct link correct date; 28th might update earlier authorization). 

The results almost immediate: new tests flooded market. Many China, put together hurry. calibration testing them. course, many simple tests looked simple antibody proteins - rushing, put simply. long [independent done, showed lot tests tremendous false positive rate. false positive rate even [varied massively different independent go without saying time ~0% population many places infected, test false positive rate 3% would simply tell 3% FDA press release retracted authorization number tests. one used santa clara study certainly authorized FDA.

I believe Santa Clara study, along early Miami-Dade study, done Diazyme test. see press release entirely front cross-reactivity Positive results may due past present infection non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, 229E.

The Santa Clara study showed ~3% area infected. Since ~0 people died time, put IFR around ~0. massive problems study though; done good faith all. attempt made count deaths besides official numbers (and tests numbers ~0). study self-selected: professor wife found volunteers facebook. Perhaps forgivable since big rush, realized numbers bad study still pushed truth cited everyone political agenda, including CDC copied 0.26% IFR number.

Today essentially every serology study stays away IFR argument. even today good way count dead. leaves personal agenda: whether want take soft lower bound tested deaths, hopefully upper bound excess deaths. Nobody done science get better deaths count.

I believe current holy grail IFR [this shows exponential variation age (approximately 1.4% 65-year old, approximately factor 10 per 20 years age). Nope :( 
US daily numbers :( I’m sure you’ve following cdc’s journey. White House administration taken away lot ability track share information. important information sent White House team, cdc. It’s fault. even tho cases gonna super high, think they’ll still open(even more) January/feb isn’t really spring wear mask public. it’s choice it’s smart choice. However, also earth long enough studied enough history know give government inch, take mile. applies everything. mandate masks safety, else mandate “for safety.” It’s slippery slope. truly believe that’s lot people aren’t wearing masks. either don’t care, it’s protest government telling lives. bunch morons burn buildings summer get away it, people don’t want wear masks. suddenly zombie apocalypse seem far fetched Literally what?

Are randomly ranting US now? Ooookay know it’s bs, since multiple states sounding alarm hospitalizations. Tons people getting sick right now. We’re headed dark winter. That's indeed people ignore. 

From newspaper, one month ICU plugged ventilator machine wake go home. best need one year work extra year fully fine. Even without going far thread sub 50% long covid, let's say lasts 6 month that's pretty bad too. 

Add employer, afford one worker sick, suddenly half employee contaminated month, basically postopone everything doing.

That said real question able slow virus enough time get vaccine virus spread anyway fast. spreads, spreads slow enough minimize impact Even mostly young people time round, even better job treating sick deaths reduced, kind growth gonna max hospitals still kill LOT people. hear side story media. articles dysfunction? would love share them. Can’t forget something never learned 40% country thinks we’re great... live Washington state pandemic continued less fewer people actually wear mask even though mandated governor. work doctor's office wear mask 8 hours day public transit. Usually, mask come home.

I think mask mandate nation would much good. People polarized right nation would nationwide mask mandate enforced? Would National Guard deployed? Guarantee civil revolt. It’s like March sad tiring debate man still technically risk. well multiple employees risk. Yes, leave cult religion blacklist community harass endlessly. Mormons sunshine rainbows. appreciate depth response. 16 percent positivity really good.  real. South Park said best. Yeah, schools open town in, worry parents take approach. Veteran army combat medic paratrooper. Yeah, shit broke me. work sales now. Everyone asks go back work medicine. seeing bunch kids die arms legs blown got little bit. That's why.  didn’t? maybe month, mid march early may, businesses (mostly clothing retail bars) closed many stayed open even curbside only. people still able go mill parks without masks on. 7.9k ICU beds free atm, 1k covid patients, emergency reserve 12k beds activated divi numbers, incl. hospital locations statuses:  Yes please. widely available though didnt call cherrypicked data. didnt even dispute claim. said make whats coming. whole point. People never withhold accurate data percieved outcome giving it. point going circles haven’t. They’ve allowed inept administration completely devalue message disregard science. son’s high school scheduled open hybrid format January 2021. Elementary schools scheduled open hybrid learning Nov 30. live CA county live second stage 4 stage infection severity tier. district school board county public health office approved plans re-opening.

I’m little nervous sending back son excited return school person. point it’s healthier long term send kids back let chips fall may. ""Herd Immunity Strategy"" fancy label saying ""I want anything want pretend like I'm callous uncaring incompetent inept."" virus 99.4% survivability rate borders. Public health measures mandates apply defined jurisdictions. There’s reason rates infection different depending governmental responses. think anarchists small government enthusiasts would get along anyway. They're really small government enthusiasts, huh? Tldr: run state's budget office, public health officials. appears public health officials also told let anyone know this.

Excellent journalism, really tragic state. long till 100k daY drive continues Gangsters like wearing mask hiding identify? That’s new, good them! *asking* people wear masks enough send unintelligent people deep edge.

Imagine mandating it. idiots revolt.

....and they’re already revolting enough. Got it. I’m idiot, Mr. Tit Sauce I'm honestly surprised, good Minot Nobody going distance year, mask wearing might last bit longer wouldn’t count it. yeah. keep distance ""peaceful protesters"" balaclava instead mask. that's nobody engage nighttime protests. always people around want incite violence theft riot. delicate situation. take one Instagram mommy’s kid getting little ill vaccine much dissuade others taking it.

Since many vaccines give temporary symptoms like this, Instagram mommy's kid going viral inevitable. get vaccine university admissions parents lost immunization records got sick day. authoritarian society, censor dumb shit like that.

I think ultimately need kind tax incentive something get lot middle-class people trickle. combined workplace, school, travel mandates could it.  Ohhhh, NEW HIGH SCORE! USA! USA! USA! eyes popped saw South Dakota number. top 5 horrific. March said husband, “We’re gonna 5k cases tomorrow (just USA).” solemnly nodded reply. thought might height, wearing masks since late-February hardly leaving house. kept waiting nationwide two week lockdown. fucking end October. charts exponential linear.  I’m genuinely scared upcoming holiday season. very, social time year Halloween, Christmas, thanksgiving, New Years...and it’s also right time people’s pandemic fatigue kicking in. I’ve seen people schools, homecoming games, posting party flyers, etc. Families also gathering it’s gonna huge maybe thanksgiving comes Fauci say expects every American get it. hope contain healthcare resources get overburdened spread thin. Sturgis motorcycle rally much? get offended.  guess time us get what's coming us. Call payment full complacency. take classes foster care system, get fingerprinted background checks, house inspected. waited long time. offered child severe heart defects Syndrome, partner feel capable parenting child needs, likely die young. almost received another placement fell through, daughter later adopted placed us.

Sadly, nearly went back home, twist fate birth mother moved away, lost transportation set back while. got pregnant, thought DCFS would take away next baby, signed rights. took another 6 months father sign rights, able adopt.

A couple years that, placed another baby, five weeks old, couple months. thought would likely able adopt him, long-winded shenanigans went detail here, returned birth mother.

The next time got call, adopt 2-year-old completely clear. license week overdue, planned continue last wretched heart-wrenching experience. also moved 1-bedroom apartment, DCFS requires kids room, share same-gender kid sibling, happening. that.

If specific questions, I'm happy answer them. There's still huge need foster parents, even planning fostering, lot kids care become free point need parents adopt them. used get bulletin every month featuring 10 kids free clear adopt, heart always wanted adopt all. :)  there's trump who's mocking reporter wearing mask. wealthiest, scientifically advanced nation history civilization, yet ultimately allow half million citizens die several million get sick because, powerful people supporters, otherwise inconvenient.

That abject failure. Soon relative. Maybe soon 2022... currently evidence wearing masks reduces disease severity main driver 2 things. 1- Presymptomatic spread due fact viral shedding almost (or even peak) symptom onset (unlike something like MERS days after) 2- fact people seem shead crap ton virus way predicting (my friend presymptomatic phase infected least 8 15 people 2 hours indoor contact March.  people presented symptoms) I’m struggling with. take pandemic really seriously considering skipping one Christmas (out many many come). mental health perspective spending holiday completely alone also terrifying. lived alone throughout point don’t know could take it. also don’t want get sick get anyone else sick. It’s hard. I’m skipping everything else. self quarantine 10 day doubt enforceable practice. Dexamethasone

And treatments derived fetal stem cells Yeah, seems like super aggressive estimate Germans listen science? happened Australia start second wave twice size first. 

It took near total lockdown across entire state stop it. Sadly, many people did. ""eating drinking"" gatherings social distancing wearing masks. 

These necessarily people normally considered uneducated either. raises question practicality education supposed receive. tell grown people things supposed taught little children? Things like wash hands, cover nose etc. 

Really? Yes, here. looks like many people think social distancing optional long wear mask. irony impression, older people wearing masks covering mouth keeping distance. ones following rules book mainly teens. started comparing well European countries Europe whole performing compared US. compare France Sweden Germany countries too.

Using total numbers great either, comparing 200,000 dead US compared 10,500 Belgium sounds worse 691 912 deaths per million. They’re sending cases Idaho Seattle, kept numbers low since faced outbreaks time New Jersey. still don’t socially distance Idaho. Several people die living dead wake see what’s happening.  Idk. Covid stopped shootings pretty well. least school variety. Notice begins 2021 ends 2023... thats bit worrying sign... use wish, need source something. K one jagaloons voting every post? far...  don’t understand words post. Anyone making broad statements entire country wrong. Similar testing experience city many others, get test kit delivered picked apartment day free. Ah yes, that’s right. worldwide pandemic purely US election. remember hit 3k deaths America. said myself, omg, another 911! another 911 every couple days!! become numb numbers now.... number everyday...one death tragedy, thousands statistic ....sad Yup, similar scenario me. friend church saw post Snapchat entire homecoming football game dance. It’s odd United States ignoring pandemic  feature COVID-19, feature pretty much every infection. COVID-19 prevalent infection moment. public required, area anyway, people wearing masks keeping physical distance. general consensus many seems they’re “over it” going resume socializing private bars restaurants. I’ve seen lots pics social media people private gatherings social distancing, it’s clearly immediate family. huge bashes, definitely enough would increase risk spread.

Combine spending time indoors due colder weather, return schools, outright refusal areas implement mandates, it’s pretty easy see thing picking again. expect lot US states start locking again.

Now recommends lockdowns. means tell friends family got anyone came contact with. longer possible contact everyone What’s BNO?

Worldometers uses 00:00 GMT cut new day. always assumed differences hear US news use 00:00 EST cut off. know that’s true? *Laughs India*. People 300 people wedding. I've looking ex girlfriends killer 2 years.

But one it. couple days came back agree disagree things. seems actually relatively civil discussion Reddit even disagreement, find rare. 

From gather looks like situation getting better. Cases raise. definitely want another lock I'm afraid continues, states institute lock knee jerking act first deal consequences later measure. (Mine included, California)

Ideally governors president would've used summer months constructing implementing plan case COVID comes back. like mentioned, things mind that's that. that's debate rather get into.

Good news looks like vaccines coming along smoothly imagined, thanks pointing out. still undergoing trail it'll take time one distributed. hope spend time convince people take vaccine. know people feel particular way vaccines.  Missouri wreck.
They’re going full-shithole appease orange god.
They also shrine Rush Limbaugh. Get ready tomorrow’s numbers, sorry say. USA! USA! We're number 1!

Wait, HolUp impossible goal social distancing, wearing mask avoiding large crowds therapeutics vaccine thousands die? Seems pretty straight forward.  Yeah man 1 hospital 1/4th capacity spring city already seeing pullback cases + new recommendations fucking horrible Correct “Mormons” (members church Jesus Christ Latter Day Saint) believe Christ Faith etc also believe wearing masks [(cnn article POV one true understanding faith would use reason act foolishly... fools fools, without religion (though Reddit realize religion often considered bad reason) flu. know several people gotten still symptoms plague them. them, joke. One 50s, two early 40s, one late 20s. flu can't go round round us. want get once, let alone multiple times.

And even try slow spread, would still keep going around. There's way protect vulnerable Covid mortality, that's pipe dream. napkin theory best. Honestly, pretty simple, avoid bad news, good news isnt misinformation. example, google ""Pfizer"", ""Moderna"", ""Vaccine"" everyday see hoe vaccines coming along. keep track sub times day incase something big happens.

Looking good news always helps mental health. shortening patient's hospital stay big benefit, patient people needing hospital bed

Not ends causing unintended side efffects don’t know about. 

One example gave previous post respect hormone replacement therapy (HRT). later found increase woman’s chance cancer.

Some women willing take risk. I’m sure people would gladly take Remdesivir even though know next nothing long term whether patients study got better own.

One earlier posts explains study might flawed ways. somebody else wants political tho Shit hole state lmao Yes requires consent. Better yet, get advanced directive wishes writing. hospital ethics committee lawyers that. declared brain death cases family refuses remove life support unethical law back remove life support cases. happen twice far. Exactly. ever way royally mess done. ""But wait! There's more. Over, amd new plot twists whole fiasco. would almost think part sick script something. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 silly people, stay away scripture, dance confusion illusion 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 false hope 🤣🤣🤣 anything repent🤣🤣🤣🤣 silly people 🤣🤣🤣 Yep, seeing lot people south Bavaria wearing mask mouth only...as breathe via nose. Noone seems care, even pharmacy people wearing mask way normally served, questions asked. far people know caught virus fine...a head ache.. flu symptoms....one guy even building something sick.
The death covid heard even covid related. man died cancer hospital said covid.The hospital said state told put down.
My guess state receiving funding covid cases?
I believer severity virus first.
I went bought food supplies like people...it silly.
I still wear mask,I still take precautions wife parents sake...they still afraid want get sick.
But reality, actually see around see news read here..it's dangerous warrant shut country.
I think blown proportion iv heard corrupted people fucked... placebo, placebo hospital 15 days, remdesivir hospital 10. 5 days hospital really expensive takes lot hospital capacity pandemic. pandemic might never gotten approved. Uhhh anyone else even get read article? True story. I'm band. Spring, summer fall festivals bread butter. indoor gigs got quickly canceled entire year pandemic really started bearing down. that's good thing, going play indoor gigs anyway. outdoor festivals got canceled well, get call see could festival November, weeks now. really felt like horns dilemma. entirely possible band members stay separated crowd. virtually impossible us stay separated other. 12 people stage, five blowing horns, three us always singing. grappling dilemma, organizer let us know going event regardless informed it, could 25% capacity people could maintain social distance.

I realize story vaguely related posted. agree tone, sounds like kind ridiculous distinction. distinction scientific community making explain see widespread spikes infections result protests. pretty commonly accepted scientific community indoors recirculated air bad. Less bad still risk outdoors close together stationary. question viral load, protests move, one ever one viral load location long enough get enough virus become infected.

I write science, like follow it. :-) Please, don’t time type negativity. believe Dr. Fauci King Covid. there's earth. pretty large region still  people surprised people don’t wear masks? living country “the rules don’t apply “. people although handicapped park handicap spaces. don’t care. people 8 items less express lane get line 15+ items because... “the rules don’t apply me”. don’t care. know people. You’ve seen them. 
We living self serving it’s society people surprised people won’t wear masks protect others. America! It’s me! 
I wear mask. I’m thrilled it’s me!!! Libtards everywhere. Reddit infested matter many shoot multiply like roaches.  Wow. energy explain care people. living rock, happen forget middle pandemic? Money matter people’s lives. doesn’t make sense you, seems like extreme opinion, nothing say get rid cruelty heart. It’s job teach empathy generosity.  Nice generalization stereotyping got America, someone sue oblivion. seems pointless. going test everyone every week? one time thing? latter, can't imagine bigger waste money. Even catch every single positive (which impossible, anyway) huge number pre-positive, infected recently. big outbreak can't test trace way anymore, certainly one time test. mask, distance, keep people small groups. really lot easier getting army test every person country. Trying implement measures would prompt social unrest even protests Western countries, thereby making counterproductive. Plus lot easier enforce travel/immigration restrictions island (The people crossing N/S Korean border annually probably single digits anyone cross turns easy isolate them). think need point arrogant self assurance actually vaporous baseless self importance rooted ignorance stupidity

They aren’t sincerely asking dumb questions, harming people’s health arrogantly incorrectly denigrating dismissing reality look population aren’t badly trend worrying. going today. Usually Saturday drop off, we're already 71k three hours left go. They’ve consistently wrong they’ve under-predicted numbers, right? Apply tinfoil hat head people could idenify isolate freaks society. 

Flat earthers really tagged. Clubs open? Bars restaurants social distancing I'm spread issue said wont able enter country without negative test done border antigen test, done previous day two wow must even nicer person.  Yeah, rural Appalachia here. literally company making tests city, able get test requires doctors order. Occasionally we’ll drive-through testing. Usually there’s political rally nearby. assume already googled it, case: everyone counting “US equivalent” sub? going new standard metric everything? 

Stop bringing US every single non-US post - us actually interested what’s happening elsewhere. Oops. bad. must’ve looking graph. Number confirmed cases higher we're testing more. may similar numbers cases similar numbers deaths before, lot cases confirmed. Same. reason makes sense wiping groceries wonder before.  
I thinking day many people (including myself) used drink i.g sodas occasionally seems really stupid now. sounds like high concentration soap. think 2-5% soap water fine. Perhaps look that.  ...and making people realize it’s magical fairy dust sprinkled world — social distancing, masking, mitigations necessary throughout 2021... Feel free send DM ModMail future something like comes up. crisis, trying scam people fear. Sickening. would hope everyone living Europe knows what. away... any... moment... now.

\-Dear Leader Halfwit Arizona covid surge, quickly dropped started mandating masks cities counties. It’s night day.

All true part... think two dates correlate, look up. Oh definitely good. FFP2 masks available? That's tragic, actually. Would nice people could coordinate massive protests point. live Berlin. 30 years. live Indiana state sheriff said thing. pretty much everyone wears one indoors well. even crowded outdoor event(farmers markets etc) see people taking store. mostly older white guys, Hispanics. try avoid shop. small outbreak city that's traced back local church. led cases IEP/ESL kids/teachers/staff already gone back classroom here. expecting begin hybrid learning rest students first week Nov. point think that's asking trouble. teen decided take job Target season added risk. Republicans less likely seek vaccine actually interesting wrinkle. That’s even really anti T**** thing would medical fraud. Hospitals get bit funding Covid patients, costly treat. Lying many Covid patients cost licence funding. See details rumor started. might ""and"" ""the"" rant accurate. Otherwise, much. think u getting confused, corona brain fog starting? Anyhow I'm wasting anymore time chatting u. Seen Covid action pretty sight all. Wash Ur hands, wear mask wherever u go stay happy Ur bubble. situation going get bad next weeks/ months people put aside doubts trust project look combine space, rail, cyber security artificial intelligence-based technologies enable remote medical analysis consultations require data exchange high security standards.  This includes space-based technology satellite communications geo-positioning, enabling advanced telemedicine remote diagnosis travelling. allow on-board healthcare personnel remotely consult specialists conduct joint assessments.


They're building phone wheels.  Try America you’ll catch 2 chest got near R&lt;1 ... turned around headed fast last 2 weeks. one anything. 

The people ""bubble"" socializing going stores right getting worse. following safe practices since March. Now, suddenly think safe worse ever here. smart, responsible people. That's government needs somewhat involved, restrictions quarantines consistent message. even smart conscientious people letting guard fatigued, feel hassled. Meanwhile USA goes... Hold beer.

Smashes 250.000 days exponential growth. 1, needs immediate family. context. Always.

The economy matters much actual people. forever entwined. can't understand that. can't help you. 200 Million people. seem like care them. always alter headlines make US look better.

I've reported third time this.

Imo, max amount disrespecting sub-rules. Better think. 

Ugly fixable, monolingualism. hardcore study Korean years, able speak depending motivated learn language. 

As beauty, fat people lose weight, frumpy people buy better clothing haircuts, facially unattractive people get plastic surgery. Paris bars open, even though don’t kitchen. Seems like cheat ban serving peanuts popcorn, boom they’re suddenly restaurant.

Also clearly zero respect legal 1.50 meter distance tables (or 1m chairs). it’s customers, business owners also irresponsible. Terraces packed 6pm 9pm. beyond ridiculous. convince people it’s safe...tell ignore T*****

I mean Christ’s sake EU Canada ALREADY started rolling reviews vaccines US looking at. Oxford Phizer aren’t even developed America. It’s bizarre people think Trump power put fluid vials declare vaccine.

IT TRUMPS VACCINE.  pro-vax (i.e. pro-science), get vaccine COVID-19 approved least one Western power addition US. painfully obvious CDC FDA politically compromised Trump administration. shameful state affairs, that's stand. current leadership federal public health agencies must purged stood public Trump. Herd Immunity can’t even work without vaccine present, least without killing millions people along way.

A medical podcast called Sawbones recent episode herd immunity, along many episodes related lot different topics medicine. 99 percent survival rate. Non us get planet alive anyway 😒 told Sweden better others? I'm pretty sure Norway Finland beats Sweden's numbers easily. Sweden's numbers worst among Scandinavian countries.

My theory two factors contributed Scandinavian countries good without putting effort.

1. ""big family"" culture, everyone likes keep already. (less Sweden, explains Sweden done worse Scandinavians)

2. Everyone takes Vitamin supplements. Scandinavians least cases Vitamin deficiency everyone takes supplements, know ain't going get enough Sun there. Ironically, Spanish Italians high cases Vitamin deficiency even though often sunny countries. 
Vitamin basically proven immensely help Covid. Well, ethnic makeup city may so, think best wish protesting happen current situation, case does, still wiser wait see actually takes streets, instead preemptively assuming group would behave certain ways.  agree. let’s wait execution plan start saying great idea. lot people refusing test

Yup, can't test it!

/s Brazil peak would right United States' case numbers proper testing infrastructure. didn’t lie. said wear mask you’re sick limited supply masks, first responders needed did- supposed staying home social distancing doctors/nurses/police/firefighters couldn’t. 
He didn’t lie. He’s trying protect us, he’s fighting uphill battle. really? cases, reopening schools done parallel reopening localities general. like candidates don’t contract COVID. They’re WINNERS. xD escalating situation beyond immediate ramifications. 

It starts question would employee bakery give days pay turn away customer mask. 

You want turn huge platitude society duty everyone. 

It’s like would get punched face prevent someone else maybe possibly losing life point later choice likely never know happen them? Yes. news saw start pandemic “wear mask you’re sick doctors nurses need do,” masks became available, heard “get mask.” don’t know what’s confusing people (potus). fair, Belgium's death data little different consider suspected COVID deaths COVID deaths, regardless whether person tested positive. likely accurate actual COVID deaths/million we're seeing US (because large discrepancy confirmed COVID deaths &amp; excess deaths), death numbers tabulated little different. ship sailed long time ago, virus spread enough country get rid it. Even start doubt US would able stop inevitable, since orders magnitude airports entry points inn new zealand. That's say nothing could done different course. would worth enforced it! saying well they’re enforcing it, guess never seems insane me. Country broken? went via PR mandates would lot success. PSAs, billboards, text reminders good old social pressure work really well push behavioral changes brave one people never leaves home. Much respect. Right. Humans around humans spreads virus 

You know humans around one another? SCHOOLS guess screw people might infect along way, amirite? Gotta respect elderly chronically ill's desire get house! Yeah, still want Biden win president actually takes seriously, fear genie bottle regards enforcement masks. people refuse wear simply care people's lives made law. Hell, they'll double-down it. decision treat safety political issue unforgivable sin administration regard Covid. 

Just like every way, liberal states drag rotting redneck carcass around behind way finishline. economics social progress, covid. as? rounding corner cliff plummet department health authority fed people would defer authority HEALTH AUTHORITIES. public health FDA guidance states right issue....

That said - *Gesundheit* Mr. President. yanks hate bill gates Yes, saw Greece seeing lot cases remember Greece well back March. Seems like maybe delaying inevitable, hey, mum 80 years old, kept safe alive well, good outcome, anyone saying, well bad old people die sociopath opinion. Hope get really bad implement lockdown protests sorts... Like every authoritarian POS come hear El Paso much? many bigger cities Texas. things get grim EP? kind mass shooting event like bound won’t anywhere victims treated. It’s gruesome America. can’t open classroom windows intruders whatever need open windows keep air circulating (ha even windows is!) 

But honestly, take couple heart attack patients needing immediate care dying floor there’s nowhere go. America every opportunity prepare moment. knew would spike fall literally zero management mitigation.  Europe didn’t decide anything. regulate economy, can’t tell shut open countries. We’re number 1

America first  mean cases still spiking, exactly mean ""worked?"" last bump failure get handle first wave, *this* second wave. actually remdesivir works serious cases, that's also promoted treatment cure, doesnt really help milder cases anymore currently have.  Actually quite safe yes - agree least spirit protest. Fair's fair That's officially shit hit fan timeline.

Before day ""huh, think serious. Probably control mostly"" day ""Oh. Fuck! going pandemic. I'll buy canned food"" Probably actually, increase ~8k per week. might 90k. texas cuttin critical thinking  trying last heard. so

poorly funded schools people actively trying hamper schools like betsy etc well got now

america going suffer future HARD school costly sooner later run important positions fill like doctors/etc

ofcourse whole immigration thing another world wide lockdown need homegrown doctors Yeah good point, Chinese government trustworthy lol I’m “blaming” anyone. I’m simply saying riots showed non-serious COVID is. sure can't ramp production 3M surgical N95s everyone one everyone wear public places next month. Stick sun let UV light sterilise use. Would totally kill transmission quickly. ""If shout random shit loud enough maybe people believe vote me""  see April phase 4?

Fixed you.

Education's sole purpose prevent people's thinking head learn they're ALLOWED think.

Everything else learn YouTube videos, need shit school actually intelligent capable actual learning. Nothing happens. testing positive take high dose monoclonal antibodies, early disease goes away. like “warmest month record” wants normal badly lol, amount pouting return us normal, someone tell him. It’s really not. I’ll gladly give 2% life saves 300-400k deaths. - - I'm sure think sounds like crazy talk - - could give money people told stay home

Ah yes, money Italian government infinite supply. money. think that. Quite states relaxed restrictions September too, really best time We're literally worst world. many hours? think Montana one “personal responsibility GTFO” states. could thinking South Dakota thoug one right mind cares anymore. media politicians made abundantly clear “serious” COVID cheered massive crowds rioters back June-ish, claimed crowds “different” it’s ok.

Well, guess what, it’s ok rioting crowds gather, it’s ok rest us, jobs lives, get back them. Testing definitely higher back July (1 million vs 800k) dude enough people country would take vaccine work...if dont even wear mask, objectively harmful/no side effects, convince something cause side effects? actual US number either tho way would work? think federal government able commandeer level authority will? Guys. numbers constantly changing. Last time saw headline like that, December... I'm even paying attention anymore. wearing mask staying away people. still nothing compared European numbers right now.

Czech Republic seen 15k cases/day past days. That's equivalent 500k/day US.

And latest models us peaking 330k cases second week November. would 11 million cases week US. Wow that's mind-blowing! Hopefully change upon you. is... China back normal months ago foreigners still work would unconstitutional damn gym fun lasted  
it really empty place great gonna close di home workouts ... 


pulses really hurt funny thing hear almost exactly comment relatives US south. ""Everything's back normal"" Yeah that's happens ignore yet Sweden higher life expectancy New Zealand.

The resources limited need prioritized. countries spent far much virus. live downtown Chicago. People businesses take lots precautions here. quite safe choose be. us choose take little risk go restaurants hang small groups friends. don’t think family worry you, especially since you’re young. 

I understand family coming regarding Thanksgiving planning hosting family members age 70. big house? so, maybe could sit eat somewhere 6-10ft away family. E tu? conspiracies believe? controlled unlike US trouble understanding? Totalitarianism HELPS shit like this... someone post article comments please No, politics allowed sub. Lucky ways, always aware potential new pandemic, likely coronavirus. usual, governments never bother listen scientists hand. Positive rate us slowly creeping last month so. 6.5% now. pro privacy German corona app software wise flawless. It’s open source, pseudonym audited chaos computer club. read see excess deaths US blow rest world water. keep looking half picture fragile ego dented. Ok I'll sound like asshole means ""do everything right"".

Having kid go houses, expect anything... We're quite bit better European countries. Mask compliance high. German politicians timid bunch almost always browbeaten avoiding dramatic action anything. Restrictions personal contact way loose way long pandemic allowed pick serious steam. Thanks lot! Sending mutual mod love :) also admitted want people panic, imagine now. person coughs sneezes public they'll probably get shot.

Why people something? What's president going virus 'you' spreading? Sure, could mandated recommended masks. everyone thinks whoever charge kind god miracle worker. Aus, PM wanted state reopen borders guess what, they're still open thankfully state premier smart enough make decisions.

Americans can't seem think themselves. Oh, Govt telling wear mask, must trying control me, well I'll show them. Oh, Govt telling there's dangerous virus, must fake. Oh, Illuminati trying reduce world population New World Order, means there's virus.

Do really think, New World Order attempt, would make hoax virus? No, would actually create virus, wise come homes see nobody died. Wow. You’re actually comparing fill Zettelchen café life dictatorship. need quarantine. Technically like 80%. sound really dumb. China controlled back normal cases, well documented lol France 1 million cases. context, entire population France 67 million. Things looking good Europe. Europe well moment. God I’m going start going way talk people. don’t understand mindset all. need to. Belgium much densely populated Sweden. Sweden better compared different countries. orange cult leader said it, build worldview around him. say exact thing measures implemented around world nations dealt virus. hope never forget leadership fucked us throughout entire thing.


People need held accountable bullshit think plenty people like gradually becoming frustrated mishandling situation. I’m sick it.

I want give fuck- can’t. think that’s current countries leadership trying do. Trying desensitize us virus people trying hang eventually say “what’s use” psychos would always blame someone.

Wether Obama, Hillary guy office undefined ""deep state"", really make difference, crazy gonna crazy. look - think comment good springboard look things actually care. Good luck! Yeah people nuts. like 9/11 they’re going take advantage enforce law even more. 

I’m pro mask holy shit sheep sub lmao That's odd landed Seattle test scheduled 2 hours believe create polarization. whole reason people anti-maskers don’t like “government taking away muh rights telling do”. creating national mandate they’re going gather larger crowds even less masks fight  say, actual interaction cop whole thing one posted local state run liquor store early mask mandate went effect. masked moment young douche came mask around chin cop immediately pointed said - ""You - mask mouth nose."" 

I faith back then. seen anything similar like 3 months. Macron specified ""best case scenario"" next Summer.

But hey better crystal ball him, hesitate share winning lottery numbers us! point predictions way off. never advocated extermination old people. That’s perverse fantasy.

I’m tired constant fear tactics!! People smart enough make safe choices now. ones don’t likely get infected, that’s all. get wrong horrible many people die, 2 million. Yeah, regardless preferred narrative, second wave vast majority states. northeast west coast's first wave spring, south parts midwest summer.  People delusional guess trickles government though hard blame nation without leaders. head CDC warned couple weeks ago: group 10 people meeting every weekends indoors without masks risky. one person group gets infected doesn’t feel symptoms gathering, 10 people get sick.

Ah, wear masks stay outside — well, course should. aren’t, that’s numbers spiking. It’s easy yell guy grocery store isn’t wearing mask properly. home gatherings beyond ability government regulate. Oh really? Like mental health? huge problem US. Heart disease? Obesity? go McDonalds buy shit load food $10 can’t buy 1 salad amount. Yea sure making enormous effort. hahaha none people mentioned care here, like COVID exist people stupid isnt much anyone do.


Its simple thing helps everyone around us. hard wear mask day? Well turns fucking easy, everyday cause work one week got used it..

If anyone reads this, wear mask, take precautions, least endanger anyone else true; public health supersede individual liberties time emergency. Pretty sure global pandemic killed 200k+ individuals collapse entire hospital system emergency. think still know wear mask we're 9 months pandemic, deserve hefty fine. source says ""recovered"" ""without adverse effects."" export K-pop fucking mistake, otherwise agree. tone again, think infection makes little irritable, although worst passed.

I didn’t realize infected. hope feeling better soon go full recovery. criminal negligence case refusal enforce masks pandemic? what, resistant basic chemistry? think lock important holding tomorriwland pandemic common diseases didn’t stop world.

Those common diseases also didn’t infect millions matter months (makes Phase 3 results easy)

Those common diseases weren’t actually simple Covid19 seems be. large, scientists say fairly easy vaccinate against. irony end making life hell everyone else. Around .65 percent summer. scenario 5 best current meta-analysis paper average seroprevalance studies around .27 percent (I think that's lower really ) 

CDC best estimates around .6 percent summer. likely either stay go down. 1 percent already top best estimates infection fatality rate including last spring idea treat disease . Going forward IFR around .5 percent close it. Bullshit. Mean time symptom onset death two weeks.

Spain, example, around ten thousand cases per day 8 weeks... number higher first wave... yet number deaths third high.

Around March 20, Spain first hit ten thousand cases per day (the peak first wave). April 2, 13 days later, hit 961 deaths per day (the peak first wave). two peaks - cases deaths - occurred two weeks apart.

In second wave, number cases per day hit ten thousand August 25. disease deadly first wave, would expect around 900 deaths per day September 8 onwards.

Yet number deaths per day exceeded 300 since April. fact greatest number deaths single day 261 October 6... less third high, month later disease deadly currently undergoing cancer treatment Ontario. lucky enough diagnosed right covid-19 declared pandemic. cancer advanced enough oncology could delay treatment. currently undergoing radiation meeting people imaging treatment delayed terminal. really depressing. u/jorgesoos said perfectly. Well backups. pick extra 4 pack every often bot tonhorde hopefully works She’s probably allowed speak hospital corporate America, would PR legal disaster fired this. get choice health rather health everyone around them. 

I'm glad least see articles highlighting utter backwards nature current strand American libertarianism regarding freedom. Freedom America never meant freedom harm others (hence speeding tickets). guys literally think everything even infringes others. absurd authoritarian. Nothing link disagrees numbers quoted severity.

Even link claims 10% global infection quite bit higher [your initial claim keep moving goalposts. Vast majority cases people 40. US deserves Covid. don’t know come conclusions. entire time family two steps ahead virus official recommendations state media. 

How? Well, paying attention talking heads looking real data primary sources. don’t understand people surprised thing watched ravage China January February ravaging Europe. Americans heads goddamn sand somehow surprised got here. 

Why heads sand? Well damn POTUS actively pushing conspiracy theories saying Democratic hoax. global pandemic gives rats ass US politics. 

So, isn’t ironic point people refuse agree basic realities call it. can’t civil discussion can’t even agree base set truths. sky blue. don’t know reach across isle people think sky green. 

That said agree division tool used powerful remain power. Especially comes wedge issues US. unconscionable pandemic become one issues. shouldn’t political issue all. public health issue. actually believes luck? disaster school board level too. superintendent’s Twitter feed giant cringe. posted pictures farmer’s market people walking around masks said “if it’s good enough farmer’s market open schools!”

No dumb corrupt fuck!! school farmer’s market. poor air quality (wildfires) windows closed. Bathrooms drinking fountains communal, special ed kids forced wear masks (understandable), many teachers serve across different classrooms, many working parents care jobs taking 2-week quarantine kids, bring school even symptoms. 

Farmer’s market. joke. actually mandate national mask policy, see Jacobson v. Massachusetts. Governments allowed forcibly vaccinate people necessary good public health. Unless AGs prove mask policies politically discrminatory (which would huge stretch) would actually lose case. Individual liberty absolute United States, anyone says otherwise idiot. put forth enormous effort prevent deaths every virus disease speak of. one different? lot countries mandatory masks doesnt help. thing helps strict quarantine. current case climb began right Labor Day. previous peak late July. really whole summer events. hate say new York March/april become norm. Well thought funny. 👍 I’ve learned anything 2020, it’s “live let live” fucking impossible goes completely human nature. simply aren’t compassionate enough. people can’t wrap head around idea scenarios fully recovered dead?

In fact, evidence pointing towards serious long term health complications, even went unhospitalized appear otherwise healthy. brother lives Seattle. wanted get tested make sure safe visit mom. (She's 60s.) called everywhere, got told get tested unless he's exhibiting symptoms hot exposed someone covid.

So no, everyone wants test get test. remember china reported 500+ cases day back late Jan, climbing past 2k days later retroactively adding 20k cases 2 days locked Wuhan. back numb numbers seemingly massive amount cases 3 week period. hit almost 500k day worldwide, many people like meh.  superspreading events caused rise? Finland situation Denmark before. rise cases seems managed stop it. things never going away

That's fear mongering. know sure, bet, would like coronaviruses - is, immunity roughly two years. And? retracted issued corrections. news. wanna pretend zero credibility.

How many times Trump lied? Yet people still believe him. think credibility... think defeatist national mandate would least set tone progression towards people this. national mandate common pedestal many local governments using excuse enforce things. Remove it’s one less reason. 

Sure, going continue ignore this, less will. addition fear fines happening alone push along well. 

One thing help much easier control heavy enforcement businesses. Put onus enforce face penalties/closure stop seeing maskless people even slowed places begin with. would anyone think that's luck?

We know chose SARS-like virus, SARS last dangerous epidemic they've seen know certain animals carry potentially zoonotic coronaviruses could turn pandemic.

We also know Trump fucking idiot reverses almost anything Obama did. That's nice idea, see happening time soon. barely enough room trash dumpster, lol.  have, past, developed vaccines common diseases too. cases speed development vastly accelerated.

So no, explanation fly all. Yeah. entire point regarding cops 'educating' rather enforcing citing. agree you, point 90% people wearing mask chosing based politics signaling rather unaware. get ""clearly millions people"" limited studies n=1-200? one? NJ pretty much everybody wears mask indoors Covid would propagate idiots fighting Trump side like wildfire. public safety precaution. yes, go clamp enforcing this. lot countries enforce way, US special. fine initial few, rest get line fear. certainly interesting point observation, availability tests alone probably make thorough testing. really interesting see comes consolidated data regarding infection rates, admittance rates related case lethality well related cfr ifr.
Sorry tone again, think infection makes little irritable, although worst passed. Comparing dense tiny country entirety US weird. Compare states similar size want that. Seriously, still headlines reading “Dr. Fauci says blah blah blah.” thing deduce articles aren’t really helping cause. don’t think made Federal law. States encouraged, however. needs happen state AGs need start cracking passive officers choosing enforce. get fined heavily enough others follow along worse that. positivity numbers Slovenia, talking family member recently, said (in jest) could probably stop testing general public, basically everyone comes get tested symptoms covid. tests mostly regular tests officials tests performed accepting people hospitals. (so general tests asymptomatics)

Anti-covid measures basically suppressed less infections diseases extent covid live 2.9% thought alarming getting close 3%

We numbers month ago. tests capacity expand exponentially. can't expand capacity 20-fold weeks. tbh probably worth it. Right social distancing measures way important. People routinely break quarantine time still contagious. that, legal precedence government force things greater good public health. think it’ll stick around Hunger Games real, People. “right thing” when? start living life worth living instead open air prison? Indeed. yet another indication fundamental failure government, people pay $100 pocket get tested. (And even then, mail in, wait get process it.)

Contrast compare way countries done it: countries different China New Zealand managed kick pandemic's ass provided ample testing citizens. yet are... lied.  True. Scary true. would seem disagree numbers. people enough critical thinking connect dots. People act differently ""its law"". less inclined argue it. Yeah, attempted walk around that. ignorant, also trying assert tribe. obnoxious. Human behavior trivial thing change, particularly large groups. could tried get everybody wearing masks annual flu, people tend discount risks familiar pay heed novel risks. likely whole lot uptake, medical establishment barely get decent flu shot coverage population. ""Parliament"". called ""Congress"" here. Yea mormon moms lot people refusing test US pride. really weird time live in. still think cat instead way around? Oh, sweet summer child. /s Yes and? doesn’t Parliament.

*--George Clinton entered chat--*

**George Clinton:** Say what? say talk know happened multiple times Bismarck. Apparently city really bad stuff like right now. wouldn’t hurt put mask around others. win.

But goodbye freedom. Freedom important safety. never say hopeless past way predict future. damn infuriating though. planet on?

Narcissus.

The planet one halfwitted asshole halfwitted followers. aren’t followed without vaccine Wow lot comments people unwilling listen results scientific research. thought liberals reddit supposed believe science opposed president. Many ICU already 99% capacity. woman heart attack ambulance 3 hours tried find somewhere room her: ( mean... don’t know. Anyone brain understands science will. don’t beginning, hopefully realize cases keep increasing live Colorado moutains. Low population. Tons tourists. can't even get firewood there's highway traffic national forests back roads. can't even get gas without tourist standing close without masks. town 200. small gas station gets groups 100 ppl usually motorcycles wearing masks. gotten beyond dangerous ppl taking advantage rural areas. yesterday cornered gated area group texans wearing masks guns . .  could gotten bad fast. Barely go bad. property doubled price due ppl buying sight unseen. I'm prob gonna sell buy private property ppl town walk within feet kids play yards without masks like joke. hospital filled atm health dep caught lying covid numbers. schools infected. ski season tourist town next door. great could get fresh produce dairy etc can't risk store one enforces mask law. started micro farm . feed store employees sick now.having get gas 3am avoid tourist tough full time parent. Ppl care kill families sad state decline. mean users American helps put US context  idk shit part state in, good assuming experience translate experiences Texans interacting Texan cops across state.  Vitamin positive affects many diseases including one. SURE get sunlight skin!

Just sayin. Also, drink plenty fluids stay warm. thinking you. Good thing models always wrong 'Even vaccine, restrictions still stand'


That EXACTLY convince people get vaccinated. putting water syringes? vaccine atleast cut infection risk half get it, infection much milder. PCR test accurate, yes, would need get test done somewhere, would pay around 70€ it. even said AG tests border would free charge. Yep. truth it’s absolutely worthwhile though. It’s additional tool fight think technical innovation occured outside societies?

I'm sure comparing humans insects fish, ants successful hell?

My original comment spoke fact social function made us fit closest relatives went extinct. absolutely false. important number determining IFR so-called x-factor, percentage actual infections know about. number presumably varies wildly setting setting (depending strong testing practices are). Estimates varied 2x 15x even 20x developing countries. number denominator IFR calculation. antibody tests, since antibodies decline below-testable levels quickly mild cases, invariably huge underestimates.

So no, even best guess. Spoiler alert: thing called Constitution actually limits government's power. So, mask mandates would actually unconstitutional would absolutely struck Supreme Court.

I'm side masks, speak something clearly ill-informed about. day highest ever case count. wrong people? Theyre flat denying objective reality. may necessary won’t followed No, wrote BS pretending like knows anything. like 4 cases people potentially getting covid twice. one knows shit. fellow argentinian agree peronism partly blame state country, IMO right wing parties also played part carbon copy french oligarchy caused french revolution. mean need look different rich elite united states compared us. 
our elites never bothered cement stable lasting model business money agro exports dried first half 20th century country doomed.
peronism became symptom older disease country never took advantage wealth set long term industrial base. specially since advances angriculture made go sector employs people least. using masks usage main reason surge cases harm good hope realise Dude, quit already fear-mongering. Everyone knows do, give rest, yeah? Jesus Christ another clone. actual fuck.  Yes. China sus. nasal test nothing slightly uncomfortable Death whole sad. 

I'm sure care 40 year old people missing cancer diagnosis due first lockdowns.

Or 200 Million people die hunger due economic collapse world food shortages surrounding that. 

You think good trade 2 people know Millions don't? I'll tell saw mother lives. Canada, localities opened whole summer without major uptick. Suddenly schools open end August, cases skyrocket. 

France. Less restrictions, people less careful. Cases basically whole summer, start climbing bit towards end August. Beginning September, schools open back suddenly, cases skyrocket. 

There seems bit pattern here, think? Game companies want keep players logging daily becomes habit/addiction. Churches, especially megachurches, need same, except weekly. stop something like pandemic. say you, mom dad, one 500. It’s closer 3%, might sound low, doesn’t take account people didn’t know it. Think it, don’t know cancer either die go doctor undergo test. doesn’t make less deadly. imagine could large 8%, maybe higher. Also there’s really much evidence people got COVID-19 become immune it, meaning get 2 3 times, making death rate much higher. Imagine everyone getting 2 3 times, would lead billion deaths. You’re ignorant extremely deadly, contagious disease modern standards killing millions people. _you_ might die it, doesn’t mean you’ll pass someone Trump elected, told apolitical wife, ""Just wait, guy going get americans killed. kind halfwitted sociopathic narcissist lethal. promise you, start war, maybe accident, find way get LOT american citizens killed.""

Im sad right. throw wrinkle in, general response be, “Why bother getting vaccine then.” separate hospitals covid-infected. Lol. stupid get? family AZ, situation sheriff, family AZ thinks sheriff stable genius taking stance well. Gonna keep breaking daily records winter long. said ""We misled public direct ppe heath workers""  (exact quote)

You think means ""we misleading public order prevent shortage PPE""?

Just want clarify that... Interessting. source? would love look deeper it. 60% states already mandate masks states almost always mandate masks county business level. federal level might mean happening elsewhere. frankly worried whether safe whether works. handle risk side effects tolerate non-life-threatening side effects me, risk involved Covid high. IOW, infected would ""poor outcome"". 

And problem get booster several times year necessary.

What worry whether prevents infection normally healthy people. Time tell, people begin get vaccinated. get soon can, still practice safety measures see vaccinated people catching it. 80k cases sounds scary realize less 500 cases actually die. fear mongering, plain simple. think opposing opinions lethality disease. Honestly could say transmissible disease would read same. x, telling family y. ridiculous argument one inclination believe. Tell me, felt government media switched position masks? acting upon available information spring, people wearing mask bothersome you? yea bad situation america example shows. luckily convinced family forego vaccinations become available. people aware vaccines dangers least Russian vaccine may taught people critical Maybe they're taking Sweden route right now...Sweden well initial spike cases deaths. aside u/fartassmcjesus, ventilation bar? understanding lots fresh air/good ventilation also helpful reducing infection risk (along masks, distancing, short contact times, hand washing, etc.) hell point? “Don’t worry thing bad re-election prospects less 2 weeks election”

Obviously he’s saying good reasons manipulate people Measures what? know tracing system intense, even so. People protesting - difference make, except way would virus control. think intelligent person actually listens CDC anymore, since March year.

It's known ages there's magical 6 feet (or even lower 1.5 meters Australia) protect 15 minutes getting infected Covid-19.

But, Sheeple 'gonna SHEEP. state ahead outlawed mask fines shifted full reopening overnight. never suggested people it. saying (again) people stupid paranoid. There’s going lots daily records breaking continuously, winter long, country coast coast. point, probably easier list countries *didn't* disastrous response. Lol got bigger problems COVID nose swab test wears out. Agreed

A federal mandate change anything, states already mandates place either enforced effective reasons I'm starting think opening schools bad idea. trump might mask wearer's, comes biden i'd expect half trump followers stop wearing grocery store kids harassed. purchaded 13 milions tests around 50 000 000 € 
There 2 tests entire population (worst regions allready tested), rest us start week, week forst another testing... 

We hope get us 3 weeks low people mobility, fail cases start going up, full lockdown can't afford. It’s headline? Instead constantly harping doom gloom, media wanted focus something positive guess?

All information want listed detail article. Except IFR, estimated 0.12 0.13% India. serological studies still underestimate cases people loose antibodies don’t develop any. Nice come it. 

Disinformation, eejits spread holding us back getting top thing. 

Shame you. know least MN case counts day day place, suspect MN’s cases backlogged IDK what’s happening states Yes rebrand resteraunts Exactly Interesting stats - source? ICU mean ventilated necessarily? believe contacts home masks worn problem. Socializing friends family assuming safe. Trump straight saying worry virus rally like always has

What dickhead need convince me. Shoot up!! makes communities interconnected less degrees separation, rocket science.  Hell, that's every podunk town kid's dream, escape, go somewhere interesting, someplace there's stuff things happen.

Most people knew left reason. job prospects better, there's (even COVID lol) 500 mbps internet cost much. cost living higher worth it. Yeah, rural Appalachia here. literally company making tests city, able get test requires doctors order. Occasionally we’ll drive-through testing. Usually there’s political rally nearby. fun, bit simulation this. basic assumptions infectiousness time replicate many phenomena seen real world.

And infections totally broke smaller social circles.

Many changing contacts large social group high risk infection. convinced many outbreaks religious communities attributed one church service, reality meeting week small groups. Church service singing major booster, course.

It's worst people meet frequently typical infectious period, obvious reasons.

Quite obviously well, coupling social groups sensitive parameter overall number cases.

So compromise help people situation, key measure fight pandemic. 9% number full shit enforce though? Sheriffs several WI counties said would enforce governor's mask mandate. Im sure similar every county outside major city across nation. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* everything US Big brain definition viral wave pretty loose part problem comparing something like Spanish flu people survived actually becoming immune life. coronaviruses become immune short time amount time varies person person going get even less well-defined waves. 

In modern times disease infectious Spanish flu probably get big wave get repetitive waves modern medicine communication rapidly mitigate outbreak.

So ability understand science rapidly communicate public allows us reverse trend outbreak since less people get infected people probably immune months wind kind endless oscillation ups downs vaccine, treatment actually kills many people hospitals stop filling severe cases.

It's also worth remembering somewhat unique problem Coronavirus flu cold flu season declines left bunch people immune strain perhaps strain similar enough strain. flu develops strain blows wad kind takes break mutates get immunity again. Coronavirus that, lets antibodies time get going produce different patterns infection flu infectious disease develop long term immunity surviving it. 

think modeling long-term immunity. get virus immune it. think modeling short-term immunity. get virus immune average x months. that's literally average sense depending genetics might immune 6 months might immune 1 month might immune 8 months.

That's kind variability working comes outbreaks waves impossible nature developing natural immunity. Spreading* Here’s thing: CDC/FDA already damaged reputation pandemic. vaccine rushed way, damage going long lasting (whether works not. Whether side effects not). Trump administration fact they’ve allowed influenced put bad situation. 


Also, Trump administration built moment it’s available suddenly everyone everyone full immunity. reality they’re aiming vaccine 50% efficacy.

^^/^^s goes narrative. People want full lockdowns disease marginally dangerous flu. remember, testing people lmao Democrats desperately inflate numbers election gets closer. ive actually traveling lot pandemic every state I've stopped Utah wear mask personal experience Jokes them, next pandemic starts December followed asteroid strike death hornets making comeback. I’m going catch flack this, France putting hard numbers... 41k new cases country 66mil? bad, much worse. can't control shit care. hands. fair survival rate high, however guarantee vaccine ridiculous false.

That's unreasonable; going happen like not. mid 2021 most, 95% people lose patience lock go back normal lives. we're lucky they'll least wear masks US hasn’t increased _that much_ since July, yet daily cases roof No. take fomite contamination precautions. Make sure contaminate inadvertantly make vector. Holy shit. Looks like wife dodged bullet. Thanks much clarification.  Hospitals went empty? several places hospitals full bursting. Great, hope hold opinion Americans talk countries.  Finally someone says truth. I've put life hold 6+ months now. Clearly lockdown strategy proven ineffective - time move on. Got rant chest buddy? 
 
Go walk get air nutter. one fearmongering. You’re stressing reading deeply things. 
 
Reinfection real thing guy impression perfectly safe since he’s before. He’s wrong. ain’t fearmongering tell that. Take that, India! Very, true. Leave review Google. It’s completely natural response anxious something can’t change, it’s stupid all. anxious isn’t conscious response, don’t go “yep I’m gonna anxious now”. It’s something feel deep down, help it, anxious something can’t control stupid, sad movie stupid well. randomly waking feeling excited day. definitely something feel anxious about. future planet many countries stake. That’s pretty significant thing, definitely something anxious still young.  relate. feel you, stranger. could support legislation raise taxes. Instead, use money lobby loopholes lower taxes. technically speaking legal america since guys mandate price ceiling masks (which countries back march , malaysia example set price RM2 / 0.7USD per piece, anyone selling charged arrested)

Covid isn’t going away. Irregardless vaccines unconstitutional lockdown measures. ""greatest nation world"", ladies gentlemen.. pisses damn much Trump makes obvious lies. Expected come Preston outbreak think, contact tracing finally top though Oh...I get it. yet States. country announced reduction waiting list ICU. Yup...Our ICU waiting list. are, today, two beds available town. One car accident ""take number."" US confronts raw reality, expect understanding follow quickly. get leaders board would make huge difference. people wearing masks leaders say important. here. Colorado college already cancelled year outbreak first week session... dumbasses. tell guy voted something.

Instead, attend rallys praise like god. America's 83k per day horseshit, much higher sure. Wave summation? brought pretty well-known (but necessarily insurmountable) problem pooling, loaded hypothetical notwithstanding:

[""because samples diluted, could result less viral genetic material available detect, greater likelihood false negative results, particularly properly validated. method pooling samples works well low prevalence cases, meaning negative results expected positive [in words, opposite example implies].

But again, overwhelming number comments seem oddly fixated pro-China/anti-Western sentiment, I'm going flip coin say main motivation concern testing protocols. India, 4x population US less half size US, almost million less total cases do. hoax dems course awful. People really believe numbers? say 1 billion? People would probably believe without questioning it. It’s gunna happen. Normal probably never coming back things “okay” won’t happen probably two years ain't America, people actually believe science, government strictest lockdown world etc etc. 

Just imagine Korea steroids. Actually lottery 50:50. Thanks Tony, welcome last March! implied people afford put kids college afford medical insurance.

The BULK people drive bankruptcy hospital insurance.

The ability spend 6 figures childs schooling fucking meaningless joke compared ability cancer eat 7 figures net worth 90 days less.

And end ICU, hit 10k day. top shit, can.

Being able afford piddling ass bill like school put big boy leagues afford major illness US. CDC official record, lancet publishing site publishes agenda said made money expense. I’m sure applies here. Oh geeze, wave really going hurt 2 weeks. Ironically right time election day

I bet trump loses he'll try get whole goddamn country infected retribution drag january

I understand dying reason, like, that's people die. dying ineptitude garbage way go. Like seriously, people die America keeps third world countries impoverished. Read Blackshirts Reds Michael Parenti, Divide Jason Hickel. Damn, record Thursday (i think) 77k new cases. Honestly, control many people give fuck see Biden able get control. “catastrophizing” “cognitive distortion” according therapists. didn’t even tell therapist worried covid back January started tripping knew would dismissed obsessive compulsive. I’ve since learned “distortions” 100% accurate it’s okay afraid react scary world. It’s also okay calm immediate danger, try enjoy what’s going right now. really find part frustrating. don’t want lie feel safe. aware things go wrong, fearing things distortion. Yeah get destabilized trip stuff doesn’t always end happening, let’s pretend bad shit doesn’t happen... make feel better while. 
Thanks reading folks. Hahaha, yea, that's going work well... wait Thanksgiving mean, shortening hospital stay entire reason optimistic Remdesivir. frees ICU acute beds. that's does, that's approved. 

I ever remember sold cure. Fauci clear beginning. People paying attention. weeks months seem fly me, seems like we’ve LOT longer 7 months. Beat it. 🤙🏼

""Heart disease kills people banning cheeseburgers""

Help Indiana, I'm sure remember greatest hits back March. like downward spiral I’m usually proud I’m (username checks out) lately. taken Trump's advice stopped testing 'numbers' would much better. /s Meaningless, said. mean you’re right, metric  necessarily. Aspirin binds irreversibly COX (requires regenerated), Naproxen doesn't. We’re gonna get waves once. 

We either die already dead watched new Borat Mike Pence speech movie back US FIFTEEN confirmed cases. mentioned President said American people safe need worry. Unreal feels like lifetime ago. Trump made whole thing partisan us. zero evidence can't

So want fear monger random factoid cant back know people reddit saying caught virus twice now. trolls? know.

[Are saying someone would go internet tell enough known virus right say can't catch twice. like common cold flu, catch **Until know more, Poland says possibility getting COVID-19 twice shouldn’t make anyone worry.**

Stop shouting fire see little smoke. Wait see flames evacuate warehouse someones food getting overcooked microwave. blows up, sure, start running. 

**Until then, stop fearmongering.** Australia zero community transmission, new cases Australians returning overseas. returned citizens isolation 14 days hotels. 

Unfortunately, 2 things happened: 
1. got complacent started back normal behaviour including opening internal state borders; and
2. Security guards one hotel got close quarantined travellers without PPE (apparently one guard sex quarantined traveller ?). 

Thus, security guards brought back home unsuspecting wider community. everybody gets inoculated small dose, 90 days covid, globally. Lol get dude took quick peak see pushed immunity stance ofc surprised Based facts? lockdown measures prevent exact crisis ""threatening"" us past spring happen. Hospitals went empty, lethality remains low, learn sickness every day. doom gloom come from? Constructive intereference! PA broke daily record set 6 months ago. ramped testing long time ago, Narrator: didn't.  Pretty sure cannot legally jailed mandate might step far, would certainly lot controlled.

First fuck cares old people dying they’re still dead Americans people like touting it’s big deal. assume you’re ok killing grandma order keep denying virus problem? fuck kind logic that. 

You also managed completely disregard anything young healthy individuals lingering effects unknown long term effects currently studied. kid example. people learn hard way  isn’t everyone talking this? news media basically silent hidden articles one talking social media except lone few. seems default position, maybe wants garner support who've suffered shit 'leadership'. big spread country 90% population's primary mode transportation car. excuse here. really.

Our courts representatives. Do. Not. Care. live rural Trumpland. Send help, pls. Won’t get fooled October 1st. Yes no. Pretty sure majority immediate family got way back January supposedly got here. knowing sure pretty stressful October 23, COVID-19 daily deaths US reported Washington Post 3.1 times number 298 military deaths US suffered average day main U.S. involvement World War II, beginning Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, end World War II September 2, 1945.

During World War II, US suffered military deaths, day Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked United States Pearl Harbor, Hawaii December 7, 1941, end WWII, 1365 days later, September 2, 1945. he's argentina tard, even racist, would xenophobic someone hates coffins, I’ll choose mask. Europe likely 200k cases back April peaked. Lots countries testing enough. 

For instance Belguim hitting 300 deaths day April reporting roughly 1200 cases. 

Also, case counts deceptive. include among false postitives multiple positives person. trying morbid we're kinda overdue public political figure dying. far, enough presidents, PMs etc it, one death amongst them. 

Might someone high CCP died thete, surely let known. Best fucking comment liver. Sounds right. UK government people general clue. Exceptionalism curse. didn’t even read headline saying masks help stats completely meaningless demonstrably untrue know past pandemics. quality 'science' upvoted sub us politicised mindlessly upvoted. Every time. I've always believed Luck happens Preparation meets Opportunity. literally mocked reporter wearing mask YESTERDAY. They’ll come new line, don’t worry. try herd immunity... hydroxychloroquine, stop anyone pushing available general public home treatment. It’s strange, long covid seems rarer India. I’m theorising general lack autoimmune diseases South Asia. Remains seen I’m correct though.  Jesus that's awful, UK even covid bad U.S. pandemic already shortage healthcare workers...this going morph second crisis affects U.s. healthcare decades. Massive brain-drain, spike healthcare costs uninsured caught Covid, drastically reduced life expectancy. Damn it. Iirc, Pete Ricketts (NE Governor) specifically pushed mask mandate. Going far threaten sue Douglas County (not sure works) putting mandate place. ""How could possibly happened""... Say 500,000 dumbasses motorcycles once... decline (and have) treatment, tests procedures long I’m deemed competent.

As be! Hear hear! It’s ONE study. 

Not everyone contracts Covid ends hospital.

According one source “Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital care”. 

But that’s report systematic review literature that’s peer reviewed published biomedical placebo, placebo hospital 15 days, remdesivir hospital 10

As I’ve already posted thread could many flaws it.

The standard care respect treatment medicine illness developed numerous clinical trails go various phases conducted findings published, many publications replicate study using treatmrnt found effective clinical trials. must obtain findings, systematic review (usually form Cochran Collaboration) relevant published studies conducted.

At one point surgical procedure leucotomy, commonly referred lobotomy. considered standard care. António Egas Moniz, physician invented awarded Nobel Prize 1949. ?it longer standard care filled would referred barbaric treatments years electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) shifted favour.

Medical prognosticators suggested many current treatments chemotherapy considered time barbaric “slash, burn poison” (remove surgically, use radiation, treat chemicals) commonly vogue, especially amongst women breast cancer fall favour well new treatments developed. time we’ll see absurdity approaches well. estimates many cases per day days? Trump said rounding corner! people fucking stupid. end humanity lie hospital bed gasping air even though 100% oxygen doctor tells go ventilator, would know intimately care much. problem vaccines might still transmit virus case get it, even asymptomatic, vaccines usually work well older/immunosuppressed groups. 

Returning us stage one. let's get even started virus mutating, re-infection, antibody count decreases, etc. Masks, hopefully better diets, stay, lockdowns, social distancing, not. Ok, genius, work? Here, people allowed enter establishments (malls, groceries, etc) wearing masks shields.. teared listening. actually understands numbers lives impacted many ways. nobody wanted try it.

LOL. Ok trumper. Third world countries fucked either way though. Poor healthcare infrastructure poor economy. It’s damned do, damned don’t situation. Yes, can't afford shut economy anymore... partial lockdown basic idea ""silent infecter"" found PCR tests send 10 day quarantine, want tested stay home also 10 days (you go shop basic stuff). 2 testing round country, starting next week solve problem, hope case least drop little bit copying czech graph one worst world. 

If help hard lockdown, sad around 50 people ventilation 120 JIS (hight care) hospitals collapsing. we’re making stuff random now, okay recommended masks early shortage health professionals needed them, literally said that's recommending them, later supply steadier recommended everyone wearing them. That's flip flopping, that's able hold one priority head time, like adult fully functional brain *should* able do. Brb gather thousands protest shop warmart go place worship support small business. don’t get paid take time quarantine America? angers much! multiple family members teachers school administrators Utah.

Wrong. available experimental stage nobody wanted try it. Besides effectiveness Regeneron still debate possibly better treatment options there. Yeah, much like tsunami analogy, 2nd wave sort built 1st wave. Feel bad guys :/ Science win

Well there's problem right there. guys running country's pandemic response (USA) science deniers. love see it. /s I've explained detail somebody said understood. next day back sharing posts lack antibodies Facebook. 

Some people believe want believe unfortunately objective providing insights help make sense vast confusion marks pandemic illuminate paths research. addition insights produce immediate action, pandemic provided us unique opportunities witness human nature unfolds, changes patterns reproduction, shifting social norms, curiosities cognition warp recognition threat. paper call action science—both application existing knowledge viral human nature also opportunity make discoveries would possible except global social experiment underway. 

\*Excerpt article's conclusions.

&amp;#x200B;

They pandering anti-lockdown side (although stop cherry-picking), simply discussing valid fact reduced exposure novel pathogens kids likely effect development. studying effect lead better understanding way microbes help shape human development rules sketchy uneven. There's clear guideline open close. half restaurants follow capacity limits. There's one restaurant owner owns two places town keeps getting fined ignores places full.
I cannot understand mental state people restaurants. sooo easy eat pick up/deliver food. Frankly, great us, we've saved ton money waste money useless tips. way I'd step foot restaurant. pisses government subsidize businesses workers could keep customers safe. That's pay taxes...for emergencies like this.
Instead, tax dollars went bunch government grifters losers like Kayne West. Montana way. Nobody enforcing, stores giving getting people wear masks, etc. Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wife going small outdoor backyard pumpkin carving gathering friends. 5-6 people going including her. Masks required, wife one wearing on. claims.

We argued today this. bottom line everyone wearing mask, mind all. trust people around considerate. seen website calculator thought really interesting. fancy also easy use. Also, seems operating lower level risk tolerance took grain salt. Thank sharing. Don’t worry, turned corner. Next week go away. know someone perfect, beautiful plan. Well else done? Lots states refused place mandate. state doesn’t even urge mask wearing without mandate banned mask mandate rule county level. SNL could make bit, Lewis Black translator We've also biggest one day record /r/coronavirus titles containing phrase ""biggest one day record"". whose members believe raise dead heal sick. 

Here's straight line, guys. Run it. age groups increase now. need sort certification recognize ""generation COVID"" horseshit written skeptics skeptics. layman see threat posed whatever microbes autoimmune conditions may arise extremely sanitary environments caused lockdowns outweighed greater danger novel COVID-19 virus, long-term effects still completely understood. amazing one talks belgium. highest deaths per 100k inhabitants world (except San Marino) noone talks it. Except that's fascism works. stronger weak enemy that's also strong ultra-nationalist mindset says exception current state things. countries worst proto-fascist leaders power. people refuse listen logic see reality things insane mental gymastics countries better pandemic. Yes, KF94 cheap, effective, easy breath readily available. Everyone wear one. That's... good way think it, way 'capped' 6000.

First foremoest mitigations Sweden put infection rates decline sweden almost nothing end summer. still large part Sweden real outbreaks yet. 

Secondly, much half deaths occured nursing homes elderly (those frail cannot live own). spread these, think 40% total Stockholm outbreaks.

So tl,dr; get higher lower number deaths. ""additional information"".  rationalization risky behavior.

If live US many western countries, assume location potential hotspot.

""It killed yet"" classic logical error obviously erroneous stated glibly. even record whole europe... day. continue add process reason. 

Also ""I chase tail God made way.""

And yet, see absurd claim is. Yeah. smartest girl class got pregnant teen, stuck there. gets by, it's-- well, still lot potential careers nearby put into. really difficult wear mask, wash hands, social distance? 15 tests counting myself. done fucking butcher felt even close pap smear. CDC's latest statement show solid proof two workers Qingdao caught virus packaging directly, rather contracting virus somewhere else contaminating food packaging handled, said Jin Dong-Yan, virology professor University Hong CDC said instance found consumer contracting virus contact frozen food risk happening remained low.

tldr: Technically could happen, unlikely. confirmed cases people ever getting infected it. minute thought mask said NHS research keeps us safe. Lol Medicare would *very* interested hospital lying treatment providing medicare patients. true private insurance.The fact bunch medicare fraud cases past months regarding covid cases pretty good evidence hospitals making covid cases get extra funding significant extent. next week daily 100k cases? Morons USA still believe grand conspiracy liberals whole world get rid Trump.... can't win stupid. hate point estimates. IFR range 0.5-1.2% it’s dynamic number depending upon number things like demographics, health system capacity, etc D:   Odd, parents memories people approaching street telling terrible people kids book. remember height elementary schools closing kids born mid-1970s. Elementary schools didn’t start re/open kids born early mid 1980s. fact colleges scrambling kids born 1976, potential students. Perhaps National census data obscures different parts country birth rate collapse.

Yes book came late 60s, took YEARS become cultural sensation.

For region grew 1976 nadir. Besides, thought general knowledge GenXers relatively small generation generation peak birth year happening beginning dropping cliff 70s.

Not mention type dual income professionals making comments environmental degradation driving birth choices may enough poplulation whole decisions impact national birth rates. That’s completely accurate even was, still learning lot new virus. That’s like saying “the new guy work screwed something up, shouldn’t trust five years later wrong barely knew anything.” definitely trust you’re hearing now. degree searching web doom/er articles one said risk free. additional information evaluation risk yourself. fun fact: spanish flu killed 50-100 million people. Half died second wave September December 1918. Australia cases low easy track spread case-by-case, rather statistical, basis. Cases pop there, every single time there's genuinely concerning outbreak, traced least one person breaking rules: hotel quarantine guard fucking guest, family gathering larger meant to, someone sending kid school awaiting test results, someone Melbourne dining-in regional cafe they're meant follow Melbourne rule take-away only, etc.

If one non-compliant person cause outbreak, seems like hopeless situation places compliance low 70%. depends wether symptomatic cases get tested. asymptomatic cases still get tested undercount may higher 3x. March symptomatic cases got tested. says cases week CDC received forecasts new reported COVID-19 cases next 4 weeks 29 modeling week’s national ensemble forecast indicates uncertain trend new COVID-19 cases reported next four weeks predicts 240,000 500,000 new cases likely reported week ending November 14, 2020.

So would lot sooner obvious historical reasons, tolerate children develop authority issues. reap harvest. Laws mandates aren’t going fix stupid, real issue hand American pandemic situation. Stupid gonna stupid justify means regardless laws, mandates, proven science behind them. It’s downright fucking frustrating. Since Idaho, probably figure 224,000 deaths states small potatoes. Thanks proving moron. questions. They’re rising continue rise least next 4 weeks. coke So, It’s funny say that, many people refuse wear masks think it’s country trying control keep inside silent. Regardless it’s pitched, nobody wants isolate small amount time result common psychological reaction people looking patterns don’t exist excuse reason need thing bothering most. I'm sorry catching time. incorrect. case vaccines would operable.

1. Boosters required toxoid vaccines, not.
2. time required produce antibodies upon re-exposure pathogens short, that's adaptive immune system exists.
3. question antibodies fading concerning re-produced... I'm quite well-versed enough immunology explain firsthand, appears moreso observation regarding potential use antibodies treatment. much concern individual patient. Sure let's go another knee jerk reaction one working well.

Every year, people **start** get sick. beginning dubbed ""flu season"". 

Not key word: beggining. 

&amp;#x200B;

If look hospitalisation rates last year's flu season see basically one hospitalised flu beggining November. let alone end October. 

And yet right 43 000 hospitalisations Covid. hospitals labelling flu cases Covid, get funding (not even touching fact highly doubt funding distributed according number Covid cases), see similar graph flu one, label ""Covid""

What we're seeing instead hospitalisations wayyyy up. People getting flu more, they're getting coronavirus one following mask mandate anyway.

I North Idaho last month, practically masks saw ones worn grocery store employees. even then, like 80% wearing wrong wearing all. idea cascading effects work you.

Michigan one top federally funded states education. Yet ranked #36 overall.

There simple solutions complicated problems. can't solve world hunger giving money food, can't fix education giving funding, can't world peace banning international arms.

""banning international sales arms"" even stop increasing armament 1899 WW1 happened. need different solutions. exactly case; panicked healthcare workers wouldn’t masks said “don’t wear them; don’t need them” really hurt credibility finally said, “ok, wear mask”. live rural area 100 miles state capitol &amp; it’s hitting us. Several older people hospital. I'd think comment would upvoted like mad sub, get -2. Hopefully wartime manufacturing act enacted produce enough us coming months get sane adult put charge. pain butt, wipe packages Clorox wipes wash fruits vegetables. I'm really concerned hospital capacity. even really started flu season.

If overwhelmed December...the amount people simply die hospital capacity healthcare workers burned and/or sick...will overwhelming.

You could deaths lack available healthcare treatment far higher worse current projections. scary imagine might happen start taking precaution measures now. town, restaurants bars STILL open even though numbers going up. Crazy...

Our family prepped best can. staying home (we never left quarantine)...I'm everything delivered wiping everything comes home. we're stocked basic meds dried goods. really concerned health care front line workers. People need whatever protect them...even inconvenient. Agreed. I'm pensive. didn’t use zinc, oleander, and/or bleach. Clearly useless! placebo vitamin C too. Vitamin C cure everything!

Sigh..... Everyone know virus sleeps night. Many people parties home curfews. country managed lower drastically cases without lockdown ? 

South Korea good example. Control-participants symptomatic outpatient adults health care facilities negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

Seems like compared COVID positive patients people still sick enough need go doctor, something COVID.

So I'm surprised significant differences, still need catch diseases well. That's true.

I believe evolution,and believe God designed life. robust.

And need explain God came from.

Again... convincing convincing you.

Why still chasing tail? Australia New Zealand enforcement, fines public shaming loom large Covid rates low. Granted essentially island nations smaller populations demonstrate cab work. 

We never get could national effort coordinated supported federal govt. could put lot people work, ramped PPE production, etc. Holy SHIT get weird looks unmasked. Like asshole. not? Please? :( Except clearly talking n95s, going catch ""maybe droplet"" n95. addition, even talking n95s, reasonings gave, repeated different occasions, are/were still reasonable arguments contradicting up-to-date stances.

Either he's A) talking ass matter public health, B) *lying public* matter public health. Frankly, neither option something society treat acceptable behavior someone position. That, getting people take it. nurse friend mine declared take first year two. puzzled asked it. said know long term effects vaccine, let alone virus long term.

Thankfully (US) already leading vaccine candidates production, last read. plan surpass even USA? may get 100k deaths nothing more. curfews pointless enough. believe evolution believe intelligent design.

And explain God came from. also said May Masks nothing

Please post full quote ... context. can't get meaningful herd immunity Covid immunity last like coronaviruses. think lot people imagining viral immunity always like chickenpox get mostly immune entire life, viruses like that. viruses get immune month six could get statistically unlikely get soon. course infectious disease likely contract especially infectious unusually lethal coronavirus. top producing short-lived antibodies entire Corona virus family tendency able jump humans animals That's going make much harder ever eradicate short-lived immunity people able keep getting it. 

Your immunity life like chickenpox even strain flu antibodies last many decades.

With kind viruses immunity lasts months that's heard immediately work would sacrifice many people.

We see long vaccines actually protect people, suspect months.

The best going comes immunity get maybe immune time vaccine comes try large scale would completely disastrous serve purpose would never get anywhere near significant portion population becoming immune came vaccine sacrifice people nothing since antibodies still going drop months.

It seems highly unlikely going eradicate disease. probably likely mutates less lethal point starts look like common cold instead common cold kills people. That's technically say common colds ever kill people. do, enough us mass fear fill hospitals up. Reddit community doesnt care much

Likewise funny reading till end first google hit article world hunger, states:

""However, world hunger statistics show great progress made towards reducing it, regions East Asia, South-East Asia Latin America met Millennium Development Goal developing countries cut hunger rates half 2015. efforts organizations like USAID UNICEF continue, even progress made fight world hunger."" looks like century event disrupting practically whole globe something would consider funny, especially paying attention makes enough anything anyway.

How heck know that? evidence people discussing care world hunger? I'm really sure what's point wanna make here. [here source info context: following IHME since March part wrong constantly. simply impossible correctly predict things long-term virus. It’s hard fight fatigue feel like you’re constant standstill clear direction forward.

Absolutely sucks stand country virus right now. Everyone taking precautions probably asking why, see everyone continue living “normal” life.

It’s unfortunate. public health qualifications anything sort jw considering much spent useless asthma inhalers, thanks... fighting corona paper masks like fought aids coitus interruptus. might small effect. certainly stop pandemy.

we looking +6 month wasted time social distancing placebo masks solutions. like would worked demand people stop sex fight aids, work demand people stop meeting fight covid. social animals, rightfully, rather risk infection stop life worth living.

we told temporal thing vaccacine come soon make go away. lied to. odds vaccacine effective first try much worse made believe. even everything works perfect get really lucky get en effective vaccacination really fast, take YEARS administer everyone. fact vaccacines rushed. time study long term risks - tests get skipped. rightfully LOT people refuse take part larges human trial history. even get vaccacine fast, possible effect promized.

ithere reason believe corona go away anytime soon - maybe wont ever go away. fist step must stop lying us. need effective alternative solutions.

right got risk reduction personal level ineffecive means. failing everywhere around globe, working. nowhere.

when started told masks ineffective - becaus masks had. least buy paper masks tell us trick. dont. need real masks. fp2 masks. evyone. need enough swapt regularely, make sure even poor get them, fukkin expensive changed often advisable.

we need better health system. always said big risk would high infecion rates would overload hospitals would cause many death virus itself. so: nothing done increase hospital capacity?

they talk trillions moneys corona founds. buts whos getting that? european perspective, see failed stats like spain get tons save banksters. VW. fak??? money adress issues instead saving stock quotations net worth top 500 indivuduals increased 35% since start epedemic? politician making sense? see yesman current course retarded idiots claim virus doesnt even exist.

if think really hard worse happening around world, cant make anything up. never said implied opposite I'm sure point Failure brought nice mix decades propaganda American exceptionalism. love idea ""strong men"" physically beating virus. little knowledge biology needed understand situation deal effectively yet are. failure many levels.

Somebody let ultra wealthy know general population able deal plague benefits maybe they'd stop dismantling education system. Create mask mandate replace law enforcement officer refuses enforce law. 

Of course, we’d functional nation order this; it’s unlikely. FFP2 masks. wasn’t “misleading public”. *didn’t know yet*. changed recommendations science came support it.

He thought masks wouldn’t helpful. misleading people, *wrong*.

Even experts get things wrong. They’re human. fact quickly changed recommedation *good thing*, shows letting pride consistency come way scientific knowledge time. Tennessee here. talking police officer yesterday file report someone bought something online chargeback kept item. Anyway, rolled house maskless. put mask stood right next whole time talking never wore one. county mask mandate. even police ignore it, don’t know we’ll do. It’s joke. 1. Please give source SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ""fading"" faster infections.
2. significant immune responses wind damaging healthy cells extent. 
3. even know substantial B cell response viral clearance general. viruses obligately intracellular immune response primarily mediated CD8+ cells. Antibodies interact intracellular pathogens, viruses otherwise.
4. implied ""member general public"". Please verify me. Especially gets colder out. wearing mask winter like repeating Feb-Apr again. time masks evaluate. don’t. you’re tired something doesn’t give right go possibly kill bunch people. Russian roulette. Holy smokes, sitting back watching people die hoping live actual position elected official? Idaho, making Utah look good. chinese restaurant Germany last week packed many people. Maybe think restaurants close soon use opportunity. fair  agree many points. Poverty, addiction, mental illness, abused, etc, legitimate issues need addressed. I'm talking people really genuinely shitty individuals. know some. us know lot them! definitely people perks good, healthy stable life, they're bitter sacks shit want make people miserable. I'm really hesitant call ""mental illness"" PTSD anything else like that. 

Some people really shit. Unpopular opinion: people refusing wear masks get sick refused medical treatment Good luck that, US constitution grant federal government kind authority. ""We're rounding turn"" 
*""Wait... we're merry-go-round?""* 
""Told ya so!"" Let make simple: wearing mask you’re telling don’t care spread deadly disease family. Period. Like not, people judged harshly that. real medical
mask (N95) important imo believe ease time, least last article read matter. manufacturing, distribution, availability key right US seeing 80k cases one day.

Cases ≠ deaths definitely magic silver bullet, one understands masks making claim. preventative measure, invaluable one magic one. 

One issue hypnosis we're seeing opposite trend throughout many Asian South Pacific countries. countries widely adopted mask usage seeing minimal new cases past months deaths 1000 many days thousand even 1000? one time deaths around 2000 april NYC's outbreak. I'm saying virus serious deaths real sad - purport people follow science, let's least make sure get data numbers correct. I'm surprised Fauci given battle yet. Even dont like guy. got give him. He's fucking pitbull. mandate without type enforcement meaningless . signs every store go yet Never see everyone wearing one. place I’ve seen 100% Costco. Probably dessert.  job offered us flu shots- ended scheduling second day many people people signed expected. hope sign least flu message getting out. financial times one want think live OK work TX yeah, enforce county. Videos summer looked like pandemic [What ever pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo, pandering anti-lockdown microbiology professor person believed March predicted we'd reach casualties WWII. said much lecture laughed at. looked gobsmacked thought going tell wrong was, instead said ""What's funny? asking study [insert real name]. may wish WWII level casualties.""


I hate this. hate it. Worst all, could fix fairly easily ""muh freedoms muh haircuts"". vaccine finish line, sadly. exactly restrictions parts Australia need stay place little longer gradually carefully removed. getting 5 cases day affected state see easily numbers explode. sewage systems good early warning indicator.  virus shows waste lands people hospitals. Regarding comment listening medical experts: you’re right. consider economic repercussions decisions. understand why, absence well thought national response, people would lockdowns. real trade-offs deserves debate. 

But masks? What’s trade-off? What’s counterpoint? else listening rational reason wear them? 

Just wear fucking mask dude, it’s effective downside. still tons places free (or even asymptomatic) testing hard find. Heyyyyyyyy, state complete disaster! mask, especially cheap cloth one, holy grail. Masks useless, actually disgusting germ incubators. people smart. trying **FORCE** people wear masks. Taking ""Give Liberty give death!"" concept far wrong direction becomes unconscionable make sacrifice good all...American troglodytes united.

😈🇺🇸😧 indulging classic logical error.

The risk activity impacted past good fortune dodged bullet making bad choice.

If something foolish 100 times avoid consequences first 99 times, past luck make difference finally catches you.

And never catches you, gotten lucky. Absolutely. government fucked preparation. administrations fault. Fauci said based unfortunate reality government Trump *not* enough reserves. shouldn’t case enough, was. Ehhh, buddy, virus we've seen since march virus china saw january. never experienced anything like wuhan first two months 2020. definitely sub February. maybe wasnt reliable maybe virus evolved less lethal (a common evolutionary path virus) maybe health infrastructure innately better Chinas. alot smokers apparently. maybe, government made much worse taking extreme measures. deadly virus is, matter? know going away. Even get vaccine doubt enough people take it. even do, may end yearly vaccine like flu, people get either. really understand endgame here. It’s easy terminate law enforcement officials following procedures. ask African American community!! Good advice. spend probably 90 minutes phone Costco (if I’m lucky) 1/2 order panty staples missing. 😞 give shit grocery store. I'm going begrudge confronting firemen might need respond fire store.

I care emergency first responders following safety mandates jurisdiction they're they're clock, getting paid taxes.

But means, keep making stupid fucking straw men arguments, makes look really fucking smart. Yep. going home either Xmas Thanksgiving. bad want see parents can’t take chance, especially working retail person everyday grocery store come contact people-thankfully wearing masks-but always, esp break room offices sight customers. Dad diabetic. Even feel completely normal could always asymptotic. get tested, takes days get results back, might contract time between... precise. Slowing enough stops need lockdown. Yet compliance still sufficient places supply still short. Subsidize private businesses help supplement government shortcomings incentivize greater compliance. 60 Minutes interview basically translated to: ""The President fucking idiot no, I'm surprised caught it."" really amazing plan Slovakia. hope find way test entire population weekly winter contain without high cost rest society. remember economic downturn might kill far people poor countries virus. Well says cover face. mouth. Face including nose.

I seen many signs stating mouth nose covered. following instructions. Yo. don’t disagree. struggled myself. 7 yo 11 yo. They’ve home remotely last months January, likely end year. 7yo absolutely made amazing strides. I’m shocked. 11yo well. 

I middle-aged career changer student teaching left towards professional cert/ M.Ed. already MALS. don’t think I’m going finish student teaching up, honestly. kids want go back all. miss friends, sure, they’ve getting along fine. Hopefully remains future. Either way, best luck you. It’s tough making decisions troubling time. since short lived immunity actually going eradicate disease going come back.

Your options vaccines, better treatments, mitigation like masks social distancing letting kill mame susceptible people hoping that's enough appease angry gods. determine target sacrifices intelligently blunt instrument

That's problem, government blunt instrument, nimble enough make sorts complicated trade offs time window couple months. 

That said, could better prepared, discussed sorts options ahead time. basically quit church this. live fear. check bunch high risk boxes feel like smart social distancing virtual school. Good Lord reading comment gives hope all. hope had? ): love uninformed say ""this virus like flu""....then talk herd immunity. flu, obviously get once. I've actually flu year....because get another strain....and get another strain Covid too. 

There's thing herd immunity virus reality overwhelm health care system...which verge happening another 6 weeks many states...people able get basic treatment Covid anything else. 

And that's starts getting scary. feel sorry healthcare workers right now. must feel like they're train tracks, watching come, unable move. utahn, pretty accurate. Know people meme bees families large ten people Eh get people constantly time every 4 years. shit what's best since people hate shit people like us XD Nah one exposing kid virus quarantining “Government greater threat virus” = true trump admin, insane almost time. Either way, think end goal people spent entire lives researching viral pandemics spew vitriol, know say. 

You’re basically making slippery slope argument here, get extent. confluence things wearing masks pandemic doesn’t make sense. 

The best science right indicates wearing masks significantly reduces spread deadliest pandemic we’ve seen century. One spread even don’t symptoms. wearing mask, you’re part problem. Period. rail issues mentioned want, doesn’t change simple fact. 

By wearing mask public, you’re telling people around you’re even willing tiniest little thing make sure don’t give deadly illness. shows don’t give single shot everything everybody sacrificed, things protect you, aren’t willing return favor tiniest way. don’t see shitty is, guess you. harsh judgements certainly deserved. control (R&lt;1), many cases.

If don't, large outbreak time, requiring lockdown - that's hard hide.

Foreigners go hospitals well, know. well least didnt contract acute respiratory illness. Ive heard Covid way worse Cancer 
/s null hypothesis lack belief long term effects. want people act like common, dangerous long term effects one provide evidence. Czechia here, currently @34.5%, low 30's morr week now... I'm  Trump right, *have* turned corner. /s Boy I'm glad deleted Twitter. comments post show pure ignorance people use platform. saying reddit much better use quite brain cells get point across here. Similar situation Malta. got daily cases 0. soon opened borders cases started rising again. Now, Malta one worst Europe per capita. Incompetent government putting people’s lives risk due big businesses. I’m scared Winter. 

It’s good see Slovakia trying deal issue. Malta nothing! Yes, Dr. Fauci said initially try wear masks cloth masks really thing. 

He said wanted N95s protecting first responders medical personnel. But, people cant seem read credible news source find context stating that. Televised fox news almost opinion pieces, news. absolutely fox news, find print story(internet print story) cross verified. every hospital every country lying? mean literally fo anyone surely find Covid oatient. Unless course grand scheme organised media flat earthers Perspective.

If believe WHO, obviously to. IFR less 0.5%. substantially less people 50.

But bend numbers however want fear monger. don’t fuck nutjobs functional nuts, nuts functional, use back door. Utah, pretty much everywhere. Um, sorry, no. better everyone country healthier (aka free health care) since would productive society, live longer, make money, spend money, etc etc? Especially offered cops portion fines related mask enforcement. government care people US. rich number. Well well well. four weeks hahahaha Texas, governor passed mask ""mandate"", said county decide... sheriff immediately said going enforce it.

Go ahead guess happened county. even called licensing agency (we're barbers) see requiring. Nothing... told us authority enforce it. every store attempts enforce becomes bad guy since can't count authorities jobs actually mandate putting teeth it.

In opinion, even here, cutting hair simply close contact, but... according state's Republicans, economy important family's life (but literally mean family - they've safely hidden families filthy, diseased masses). finally gave told customers, ""do whatever want... longer care... wear one, wear one... fuck it."" 27 days ago made comment. Well well well... are
😂😂😂 No, elderly sick cared general population, troubling part disease asymptomatic carriers.

There's important distinction made deadly virus many deaths actually causes.

Ebola, example, killed 25%-90% infected, average mortality rate 50%. asmptomatic carriers, despite much deadlier infected individuals, much less deadly general population.

COVID-19 severity depend viral load (how much virus body repeated exposure), genetic factors like blood type, Vitamin-D levels, factors fully understand.

It's much less deadly individual, far deadly population. spread asymptomatic carriers, US currently effective testing contact tracing standard.

Until vaccine, wearing masks good hygiene responsible easiest ways function ""normally"" reduce spread.

We really know long-term effects people, take decades us fully understand impact. still celebrate Christmas child, don’t fucking dumbass pack 30 family members house. kids gonna remember it, you’re 100% admit smart. Ya, countries control nobody knows shit... Hahaha well well well... It’s still one continuous wave ups downs. long term solution mask mandate. vaccine least year away point discovered raw logistics. mask mandate compliance shown drive infection rate fatality rate floor. I'm playing game you, man. Please stop like right thing, Jesus. sure seem like NBA worried I'm guessing we're gonna see case rates equivalent every man, woman child mid-sized city getting infected every day. ""Death cancer? Bad, death!"" Remember folks: United States led world medical bankruptcies per year **before** crippling pandemic. 

Neither major party supports ending medical bankruptcies, let alone guaranteeing service (best “access”). fucked lol *calls HQ*
Sir? Yes, Agent 55; ready beam now. What? Yes, yes...it's gotten way crazy here. I'm requesting transfer Mars possible. think chances rushed vaccine causing severe complications virus 0.01% death rate people age high wish virus hit non mask wearing idiots super hard. Either teach lesson wipe out. keeping kids home

For months end, though? That's little extreme. this, CDC recommended school closures 8 weeks pandemics.

Like u/JerseyMike3 said, threw preexisting pandemic knowledge window midst fear hype. Somewhere along line, seems like we've decided worth sacrifice educations millions children lives grandparents. Which... isn't. dont know dont care lol *Up wave goes, never ending hospital woes.*

We flatten curve somehow. ask how, I'm rando. would prefer restrictions rest life (50 ish years maybe). based news sources, facts. last couple days I've seen multiple news stories this, never really hearing before. certainly could whole time many places. Could get Congress agree however? Isn’t amazing left supposed accepting progressive, yet they’re willing group entire section America “so stupid they’re unable saved”? Amazing echo chamber like social media rot away core human decency 675,000 died USA Spanish flu 1918. time one supposedly advanced countries world may far death total 1918. You’d think 102 years later things would different. afraid factual information.

Your problem, mine. difficult understand impossible know long term ramifications virus literally exist 12 months ago? The...point...is...to...reduce...droplets.

No one saying block individual virus particles. carried droplets cough/sneeze/breathe out. time vaccine research spent waiting control group infected compare efficacy test group. takes longer vaccinating sort rare jungle disease spreads orofecally, COVID-19 currently infecting tens thousands people day basically every country. cells support B cells create antibodies. memory cells good sign. Antibodies sero tests aren’t everything. things never going away vaccination generates robust immunological memory could reduced couple days sniffles instead bodies packing hospital hallways. people totally asymptomatic still infect others. literally ran practice run pandemic team like december 2019

so US, failed, proceeded nothing improve critical responses failed test run. First, may may able enforce mandate, it’s difficult so. top pandemic restrictions, still fires, floods, natural disasters emergency think of. It’s impractical monitor 300 million Americans dealing long term temporary pandemic.  it’s difficult really requires personal responsibility time 

Second issue, vaccine. I’ve heard trying get one, also need treatment too. We’ve seven million infected, many recovered side effects. guess question is, need learn handle like flu, right? There’s yearly vaccine still limits number flu patients. Common cold, none. use simple counter meds stay home. Question is, looking medicines too? great companies dealing vaccine, working it? don’t Know answer. fear COVID it’s vaccine bust. Fact viruses don’t go away. fact, viruses found commonly US exist elsewhere still. need long term solution dealing this. barking wrong tree think dodge point whataboutism arguing good idea use powers initial argument didn't. matter whether good thing bad thing initial conversation. Try again. claimed used emergency powers needs to, quickly pivot praise shown has.  USA death spiral. 🧐 Given school openings generally safe, would    Shit anything Trump Lol, try 58 55 PA. Judge dropped it. 1. mask mandate interstate commerce. That’s stretch even Justices Soda Kankles would slap down.

2. mandate something cannot enforced? That’s governmental virtue signaling. Lmao 85k? Yea fuckin right. 
The cdc already taking accurate deaths infection rate much fuckin lower. simply science denier attempting exert political power name concern. Right?? Mexico traveled April. find got tested already daughter week ""better Portugal"" really noteworthy though, it? US compare Portugal on... anything? I'm sure there's value trivia whatsoever. People die miserably viruses diseases sickness. makes covid special? Oh that’s right, media fear mongering people push political agenda seeking strip Americans freedoms little little. Idk 2% family friends I’m sorry loss. severe asthma caught covid. I’m perfectly healthy effects. understand everyone different goes every disease virus earth. virus kill people, like shit have. shouldnt live fear media tells us should. lot people virus supposed scary.

The information presented, scary. brain know do. Hope slit wrist shit posted turns wrong agree. everything exhausting. Minimize spread percentage? vaccine never comes? see abortion morally different hunting. anything *more* moral removing cells clinical setting medical professional, hunting bunch random hicks shooting living sentient beings letting bleed out. One sounds inhumane fuck abortion Uh... know... one thing should.... 'scuse one second literally care. wanna wear mask go right ahead. freedom live ""free"" ends actions hurting killing people. right live, too. dont go? wearing masks there? kinda think worth bothered by. heard interview reasoning ""PPE could get right people shortages.""

Nobel cause.. get that, however, fact people still discussing shows LACK TRANSPARENCY health official giving knowingly wrong information BAD.

Imagine serious crisis, know people wear damn piece cloth, napkin, gas mask, anything.  24 hours make notification public, get every federal agency find every PPE available acquire it. 

Then get mic tell people wear mask like damn health care workers need stay safe.

I really love Fauci, position government agency pick choose get information. literally rail government action somehow gets pass there.

I'm sure someone chastise perspective, I'm far lib left voter still feel way. That’s interesting believe cities lot worse rural America. I’m sure fine without elitist city attitude. Live let live. Worry yourself. Approximately 9 million people die world hunger year according world hunger statistics; death toll malaria, AIDs tuberculosis combined.

Funny Reddit community doesnt care much 9 million brown ppl dying every year.... enough anything anyway. exactly. teacher area kids also large families like Utah. majority hispanic city southwest school teach low economic area. majority parents still want online learning. oldest 1 2 kids stay top others keep things going parents go work. lot parent home works night shift dad works oilfield refinery home week two time anyway.

The biggest bitching schools see almost always people comparatively much better want inconvenienced. Meanwhile people community teach used hardship phased. main (and almost only) reason parents want person ones kids struggling disabilities/learning issues. Imagine ignorant. Florida much better 2 months ago--Florida used second country per capita cases, Iowa passed Florida 6th place, Florida drops 7th country, deaths per capita ranks 10th Yeah, insufferable assholes. Congrats. ND going hell hand backet, followed closely SD. thanks Bikers.... Fujifilm? camera company? People survive still end 100%. I'd like see percentage 99.4% completely recovered. in, organ damage, lingering coughs, shortness breath.

Whether someone dies weak metric. That's like saying people car accidents end paralyzed factor whether seat belts worn still survived. would post pone election? mail vote want to. I’m voting person. teacher fuck stay forever like flu, Marcon selling bullshit like always astounds many people antimasks. Yes, no-one enjoys wearing them. Yes, minor inconvenience everyone bigger hassle position due work need wear day. help? course help. 100% effective absolutely make difference. Surely benefits reducing spread, reducing deaths, reducing costs healthcare, reducing need shutdowns, far outweighs inconvenience wearing masks pandemic. taking away people's rights, coming together(for limited time) acting intelligently benefit everyone. difficult concept grasp... Excellent point Yes. call steamed hams despite fact obviously grilled? please research point masks is. many ppl dont understand Want volunteer yourself? Good luck enforcing that. Didn’t Redfield say everyone wore masks pandemic would 6 weeks? prediction changed trimming 100k total overall fatalities. Europe experiencing worst 

False.

In countries fatality rates much lower first end August number new cases per day Spain high higher first wave, yet 1/3rd many France, second wave seeing confirmed case numbers triple quadruple first wave, yet number deaths less goes Germany - many confirmed cases per day, fraction number deaths.

The article OP linked correct fatality rate much lower now. speaks code, telling much truth get away with. There’s avoiding politics occupation, he’s one good guys honest person task force. That’s shuffled back behind potus meetings, removed entirely. can’t listen says vacuum, rather understanding what’s going behind scenes, say, can’t say, he’s trying say. Wish wasn’t like either, he’s removed, he’d replaced someone even worse. Wow guess one trip proves entire country wearing masks - 100% usage correctly worn.

WOW! better go tell someone head articles “people wearing masks” stops.

Im shocked one simple visit saw essentially none state less entire country hasn’t made national headlines!

“This random person says saw lot masks pack boys, we’re done!”  didn’t refute point advice go like lead balloon. presence pandemic (we've several) never fundamentally altered laws physics form medical science either.

Add list strange things. Equip staff bear spray. Belgium much densily populated US, compare singular states (better similar density). even still really high. Places face punishment. That's ridiculous. irony you’re making fun regurgitating BS media bubble, regurgitate media bubble side... don’t get division want? fight other, can’t hold accountable top. Regardless side you’re on, hold weight. Yet continue tribal idiots seemingly determined hate POLITICS. sad that!? would come senses! needs handled differently compared current administration's handling, clearly! working. cdc science badasses current leadership let needs done. man one going stay inside point..like people quarantine since march must feel defeated think...well what's point anymore..sigh, I'm going back life, still going wear mask.. *""Everything bigger Texas!""* require 3000 Americans dying every day 

Just 2K. 300K excess deaths already, 100 days February. Still scary... Albertana in-laws got got better. using excuse come visit... MILLION TIMES know every human action either done everybody done anybody expected 9/11 kind rallying effort. expected Americans collectively right thing, especially since equated simply wearing mask curbing social activities weeks.

I hate tell whatever rallying think happened around 9/11, didnt. USA USA USA Muh stay f\*ck home save lives!!11 fucked thing he's still guaranteed immunity. 

Considering help fight virus, antibodies might ready recognize fight virus second round. Dark winter real. shitted exponential growth charts like fucking hoax are. That's problem wearing masks US late feb? That's hard believe. opposed current president runs Twitter whine like 6yr old everytime someone criticizes him?

And um yeah I'd take actual human empathy narcissistic sociopath. We're turning corner right. going wrong way Yeah, tell people losing homes, relationships, jobs, savings, etc. Lol, good one! should, let mild virus force us permanent police state. Teams usually good leader. I'm surprised all. drove Mississippi Alabama today one wearing masks. people saw busy gas stations, might seen 5 people wearing masks total. think people actually self made self made. honestly even matter are? think pay tax whole billionaire = bad trend stupid don’t even like Bezos. Bad people bad, billionaire nothing it.

There something simple works. lots people like something run company well can’t millionaire. instead millions billions people uses product can’t billionaire?
. Could people go back work result standstill congress relief pay? lot companies forcing people take test get hired. 99.9% survival rate tho Also today France hit 1 million cases. context, entire population France 67 million. 500k might bit high side

Since already reached 300K excess deaths daily death rate easily 1K+ onward, 400K minimum given. winter hard, people stupid (another given) daily death rate go back 2K, voila!, half million go. standing zoom call morning afternoon least 4 days per week. absurd That's said. proper lockdown, would've essentially completely controlled. actually still probably get control, idea somehow shutting hurts economy continuing shitshow.

Side note, driving around today saw bunch fully packed bars people outside smoking cigarettes near other. completely fucked actually really high percentage total morons country. Eventually rOuNdInG CuRvE Doctors cry lose patients time...?

What smoking? America first! 1974 Cadillac couple Deville parked front house parked entire time grew house. got tickets month. live exact house longer car. Someone else parks spot girly sportscaster. They've 8 months completely unmoved. front fire hydrant. tickets. neighbors behind super pro trumpets.. park directly front stopping front yellow curb too. tickets. Guess sticker bumper. Lol. Yes. I'm downtown Seattle. trust nothing. conspiracy-theorist wonders Trump holding big rallies superspreader events hand Joe Biden shitty situation deal possible spite. lot changed 20 years guy Look countries like Thailand Vietnam handled things even better. Seriously. European countries fucked too. What's really disgusting deployed WW2-era laws literally nationalize factories still can't give y'all protection need. 

It's national embarrassment made billions N95's point. im gonna much blow We've share idiots well. helped good strong dose panic right start. Stop dramatic, going smooth winter already shown type pandemic make country collapse. Take seriously go deep end either. remember reading announcement December 31st China Christmas, confident worse West Nile/Zika. wrong. Unless virus literally got nuked face planet, never going away. increase insanely exponential. Last week flirting 40-50k. 

In 1918 *exact* thing happened, know end results -- 195000 dead americans one month. 

Our winter starting later due climate change, emotionally prepared. So, last 4 years, he’s still able make great?  No. “Nothing” obviously learned whole thing. US lag Europe’s spike 1-2 weeks. time, however, likely strictly geography climate, viruses natural progression across globe. Europe’s population north Mason/Dixon line. Cooler temperatures incubate viruses efficiently. Cold air forces people inside allows virulent spread. Indoor spread produces higher viral loads, likely produce symptomatic/severe cases. plunge deeper fall, higher percentage US population end inside, infecting people quickly severely summer spread, which, ironically, likely also driven climate (high temperatures across south, forcing people cooler, indoor spaces). one thing US spades, Europe seems lack, Covid denialism. think Europe end cases US winter, blustering American exceptionalism something say you... hold beer. Pandemic fatigue 100% blame IMO. Facebook feed full people visiting, even traveling different cities see relatives. People done taking seriously. US #1 US #1 US #1

WE THANK GREAT PRESIDENT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! #1  testing increased significantly since second peak? may useful comparison. will. India’s beating time soon, they’re getting 50 odd thousand cases day now. US still rising, though ideal way test since dilutes positive samples, increasing false negative rate.

Edit: downvoters explain what's wrong comment? American S. Korea family US Europe, trust me, surreal. difference attitude response towards covid unbelievable. people know abroad think something hoax flu. Bizarre. it’s post painting Europe bad light gets memory holed Idk, think we’re far along enough trials don’t really worry that. Yeah, scientist discussions every day February. boss cancelled lease state office decided move back another city work remotely. knew going shitshow end way back then. Today, people still actually claim people know happening lol, knew. Trump ignored it. back office since February, either. I’m sorry grandfather, that’s stressful. haven’t heard conjunctivitis, sounds really unpleasant. It’s like Tsunami! survive first wave think you’re good second waves comes knocks building you’re standing  Proud American day people infect. circle corners!!! mean actually pretty logical idea. Contract Tracing impossible cases 10-15000 day. Covid decent thing make aware contact with. That's nice know actually! It’s rising days mate went recently, it’s bad although like half boarding groups. also twice day instead per day keep crowds piling 10am People brainwashed posts like realizing since April.  there’s still plenty time get there. If, example virus increases 1,000 new cases per day (e.g 80,000 next day 81,000, 82,000) fairly small increase. that’s 7,000,000 new infections US Christmas. That’s great. story almost exactly opposite. agree say definitively work feels like never genuinely tried . . . I'm Mass, probably one best states terms tracing shutdown orders, DPH still reporting *the exact* number ventilators ICU beds state back March. Half reasoning behind shutting giving chance beef healthcare infrastructure increase ability treat lot people, still can't even get proper fucking Lysol PPE healthcare workers US hasn’t even ended it’s first wave, technically. India’s least reduced active cases 900,000 600,000, US stuck 2 million+ active cases I’m still pretty worried potential long term negative effects (even young otherwise healthy people). outrageous medical bills require medical care. 

I also want absolutely role accidentally transmitting others case end vulnerable it. Great numbers, best numbers No. Redditors hate America make blatantly obvious. Xers starting careers families “omg guys stay home 2 weeks summer!”  Downvote away, care. woman wrong fools ignore it. later really worrying I'll leave go find out. B.. ride never ends... agree. That's incredible horrible seem possible moment. time, I'm epidemiologist either. USA USA USA requires people actually following public health instructions, something seems American population incapable Yeah. see CFR mentioned days. accurate estimates one wants listen make informed decision opinion based new data. Ugh.. sucks. hard see light end dark tunnel :( positive news? Case-counting meaningless. Deaths hospitalizations continue plummet since April, including states like Florida, supposed chaos now. shit months. Trump promised covid going go away... any... moment... now. read interesting article yesterday. Today take granted Sun star. obvious fact. finally proven 1800's sun star, works fusion established 1920. However, [Anaxagoras, ancient Greek philosopher](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html#:~:text=Many%20people's%20work%20was%20needed,idea%20did%20not%20catch%20on.) reasoned sun fiery stone gave heat, stars same, much away. (Interestingly, next person claim this, Giordano Bruno, 2000 years later burned alive.) 

It fascinating close Anaxagoras came truth sitting around thinking sources. great excuse. lived 450 BC, single reliable source count on. 

You, however, Google, centuries acquired human knowledge seconds away; lay fingertips. sitting around thinking law probably can't exist posting fact multiple times mind-boggling. 

[Here law insist couple times exist. CA Section 396.](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/fa()ces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=396&amp;lawCode=PEN) 

[Eight people arrested hehe Americans right thing sub full fear mongers probably gets tested even twice day tells supporters otherwise look tough. true. 

Sadly report button sub include option reporting suicidal ideation, give option asking Reddit contact discuss mental health.

Please take subdued cries help better organised sub. sounds gay. I'm type like 14 year old girl lmfao bully people stay home? Probably thing said one guy store wearing mask. suppose ""human garbage"" well. Also prefer term ""garbage human"". steps ahead, January? preparing possible economic medical crisis could last months years? not, how's working you?  Please elect trump shit show never hilarious. Right? feel like reasoning flawed, even isn’t...those cases still coming community. even isn’t worried health, compassion people higher risk? I’m frustrated. Maybe Scandies sensible idk Overall fits Republican worldview-- reality subjective, get shaping truth, fellow conservatives.

This apply future though, we're concerned that. present past. won’t, virus go away... ever. hysterical divisive media coverage undoubtedly change election. Yes. poked fun wearing mask everywhere matter he’s (even he’s alone basement). (just now) pulled data Excel file recent report SCB, added reported deaths 2020 January 1st September 30, average dates 2015-2019, results:

Source: Excel 2020: 70 324 deaths
* 2015 - 2019: 66 649 deaths average

...which would mean 3 675 excess deaths. totally line SVT numbers. Thanks heads up.... .... really appreciate advice. I'm young 44. today change ... still got fever (came bit 100 now) still feel fine honestly. take ibuprofen keep eye fatigue raspatory issues. know catch Covid droplet hits eyeball..... bet didn’t know that. Sooooo mask protect eyes? think you’re projecting. Media coverage surge already increasing. lot people pay attention even doesn’t literally freeze country like first surge spring did. Came say this, really enjoying living much right People wearing masks. Yes. number found CDC said total 2.98m samples food packaging, researchers found 22 samples tested positive[live virus found frozen food packaging hopefully die. can’t imagine people much say coronaviruses whole pandemic ends. there’s plenty science based subs that, one long passed dramatic conspiracy theory cesspool point return. Ok, check later. Thanks. don’t know science works think knew March know now. Exactly!!!!! ain't USA

 Anti Masker nation... vast majority people wearing masks. depends people living Ontario choose coming weeks months agree it’s largely blown. 

- counter point- .3% fatality rate means half million people half US got though. 

-counter point counter point- Adding perspective that’s still less heart disease.

-counter point x2- that’s still excess death

-counter point x3- much really stop long term. See “countries right” Europe. Historically get supposed unless win 18 months it’s hard low death success think giant global conspiracy overplay pandemic for...reasons? Unfortunately probably result changes. want see Jesus sooner is, eventually.

We fight hold get there. pandemic kit put DOD 2008 avian flu. two N95 masks, 5 surgical masks, hand sanitizer guidelines stringent today.

I'll say again, 2008. even stated N95 masks caregivers surgical masks infected household members.

The infrastructure dismantled subject political moves suffer from.

Edit: got free mask Humana Medicare. pretty nice even fun lime green color. site weird mobile sure. PC slide bar compare worldwide mortality period dates corresponding chart pops showing country. 

with information make sense whatever data points come year.

edit: think useful compare developed versus undeveloped country mortality rates changed, big versus small countries, ones good medical care versus bad, etc etc. case, sweden's average compared rest world, compare sweden's 2020 areas world started kind average death rate  Italy said done everything right surging again. fine going 5 over? see would confused talking herd immunity decided stop talking herd immunity say so. maintain source gives one number IFR actually proves vastly lower number Ha rookie numbers. Also german. Kindergarden: 1 parent + 1 kid, 1 kitchenworker infected via kid far could track it, 1 (praktikant) learning worker? - Sorry know right term - believed via school. way south. Maybe so. per worldomeers, 7-day moving average covid deaths Sweden grew September 150 400.  Perhaps would died September due usual causes already died due covid earlier year.

I would like see chart for, say, April years. reason mask required protect individual; mask primarily protect people mask wearers aerosolised virus. every business acted like Costco snd Trader Joe’s, snd even places escorted people aren’t wearing masks correctly inside would change overnight.

Right businesses slacking getting complacent people aren’t wearing masks much people likely get COVID right least likely die it. Young people careful see mask mandate would do. still time get things control long countries willing take tough measures. Australia's lockdown Victoria lasted 8 weeks, got number cases single digits. point people often make compare year previous years. i'm suggesting look chart see countries previous years (any subset dates like) whatever happens year point comparison even talking anymore? MAJORITY people get don’t even need hospital care, may even know it! Jesus fucking Christ talk delusion. Sure sounds like matter time now, crazy think may well 3 vaccines year over, told someone March would thought crazy Well that’s lie. It’s 42k new cases. people lie stuff? gain? still seeing hearing conflicting reports regarding wearing non-medical masks effective not. think main thing driving infections people sick showing symptoms illness refuse self-quarantine. know real result unless see actual paper even fake. Maybe told test ""come man"" got negative result test causing insane amount deaths following public heath recommendations?

It actually possible downplay virus time adhere social distancing restrictions open mind things come conclusions. don’t need study peer-reviewed publications like every single day efficacy mask usage know put mask. masks required, put one on!

What makes goddamn important completely dismissive opinions? You’re one that’s troll around here! often know talking about? I’ve seen large groups teens casually emerge McDonalds like quarter wearing masks.  
 
To fair even 25% mask usage would effective 0. 
If mandate increase usage **at all** would help. always see Jacinda Ardern's story entire country back normal, visits businesses need wear masks social distance anything completely stomped out. test everybody come require quarantine 2 weeks. crazy genuinely see way US get past asides vaccine, even half country says take we're basically fucked years come. US isn’t testing many people all. 

Massive, continuous testing entire population (regardless symptoms) good way getting disease control, used many countries. approach would probably remove need many restrictions put place curb spread, would likely well recieved public. 

Conclusion: goal gather people’s DNA, shit job. Let people want, think people really listen guy? single chance. People want risk it? Go it. People don’t take care others, get sick wearing mask well sorry bad luck. It’s murder, it’s crime. People please. mandate won’t happen, want wear mask everywhere power. Don’t want wear one anywhere? Well also right well. Simple. Nobody seemed care kids poor families afford school.

Now economy party power threat, roll around nearest quack. Agreed 100%. I’ve noticed. numbers really increased two months ago. That's end jail. want go jail. No. I’m saying you’re seeing onslaught discussion new surge there’s nothing average person it, we’ve panicking virtually thing past eight months. people don’t care continue drive numbers kill people care going start tune news it’s hopeless. Literally fucking hopeless one energy devote much attention something can’t anything about. Good point. Good argument. guess see happens. Both? comment feels really woman hating. Please try least make law stop using the, ""it's law ain't it! violating mah constantinople rights!!"" least make law can't enter businesses without masks shit stand outside bitching rather inside. Arrest/fine enough they'll shut up. Honestly went fantastic - tiny headache seven year old learning stick day, 12 year old never happier. fact seeing mature embrace learning first time, he's gone butting heads constantly chilled out, loving kid wants tell everything!

Curriculum: Canada can't speak areas, thus worked me:

The schoolboard provided learning outcomes kids, show reach one list. actually added appalled covered, digress.

 example, math noted would use Prodigy Khan Academy, etc, grade level, English provided book titles logging everything read. earth sciences exploring local hikes parks, etc. signed school board.

For actual lessons, need clarify chose informal learning style works kids rather formal sit lessons. Every kid different best bet figure works family. Full unschooling, example, would work us either, aim much experiential learning can, discussions creative projects show learning.

I use pinterest Teachers pay Teachers ideas experiential learning range topics, documentaries topics dont know well, actively incorporate gaming learning (minecraft already used schools super easy, Prodigy, Zombies Run, Math Vs Zombies typing games count). 

Following advice local homeschooler (5 kids, 3 completed uni, one uni, one ace high school diploma), tailor learning losely around whatever ADHD kids moment. Right pirates, everything poetry treasure riddles engineering involved 18th century ships, history easy there. live area rich fossil beds, trips local museums hikes area must scratch dinosaur itch. Physical Ed horseriding winter, snowboarding. eldest seriously cooking moment (huzzah!) incorporate science math ""experimenting"" recipes, ingredient ratios, on. Heck even getting kids write grocery list means practice handwriting. run past education coordinator school board, approves suggests additional activities. 

In terms proving learning, take tons photos folder organized learning outcomes file writing, art, printouts learning apps, pictures taken. even November technically achieved several outcomes already - going tell that, course. kids much fun this, honestly wish gone route earlier- someone thought homeschooling religious nutters hippies. 

If unsure, check blogs websites dedicated homeschooling different styles, work kid you. Also find local school boards support homeschooling area, ton info help, too. nothing else, grab copy area's curriculum outcomes grade, see feel them.

Good luck it, DM want chat further! definitely everyone, work great many circumstances family right. We're number 1 Guess there’s point asking far-right National Review allowed here, CNN, HuffPo, etc blacklisted ... American scientists work Trump. work American government, like Chinese scientists work Chinese government. 

So question be: trust scientists working Chinese government American government. I'm three mask mandates right now. None stopped college kids apartment complex next store massive tailgate. exactly fourth mandate supposed accomplish? take surging numbers coming Juarez. No

Maybe... they're coming Texas. Eugh.

Guidelines good adjust age :( find mysterious wealthy people give fuck anything boredom? car going exact speed limit officer behind lol. 

At least everywhere I’ve traveled to, nearly everyone goes 5-10 mph times limit cop around. Yeah turn u-turn back peak cases... beyond. Fauci said something similar months ago. can't blame one person we're also getting jerked around ""professionals"" listening to. Fauci done misinformation virus Trump since large portion country already disregards Trump. medical professionals start spreading misinformation, everyone gets confused listen to. Might bad luck addition poor decisions Texas large. gave wrong information science bad. blatant lies Fauci. effort get ahead virus keep people alive lot scientific information rushed results published could thoroughly proven disproven. info things quickly corrected. scientific research happens understanding Covid whole nother level. scientists publishing info fast results came in. trying mislead anyone. 

Too bad people willing forget science works chose one mistake use fucking rally cry wearing masks. Well bay area, mask wearing ubiquitous corona again. point masks alone stop pandemic. Nothing truly except vaccine presidential debates mocking Biden wearing mask saying fauci telling people wear masks. says anything encouraging people wear masks follows three things discouraging masks. pretend Trump encouraging mask use like going viruses mutating time. limit many times SARS-CoV-2 mutated mutate. mutations deleterious, honestly produce change.

D614G studied extensively since preprint posted found real import, like mutations.

Here better, updated sources. (up Science Nature) (specifically addressing initial claims increased infectivity) like 22 positive 3 million samples Haha, good luck. miss much nuance argument. Accepting herd immunity reaching herd immunity. see 70 percent population infected spring, much higher percentage acceptable much country accepting herd immunity mentality. .65 current best estimate. move forward assume improve treatment? 1 percent death rest argument claims... fact closer .5.... especially moving forward. 

I also say much country mainly meaning everywhere Northeast West Coast. also find acceptable way respond pandemic.  y'all using anecdotal evidence talk whole state stupid. far understand, latest data Sweden 2018, makes pretty useless analyse COVID19. guys? keep spinning wheels one takes reins. “leadership” obviously it. Yeah, lie get that. want honest say want test make sure safe visit at-risk relatives, get shit-all. Isn’t 1% Czechia’s population projected die something insane like that? I'm can't speak whole world seen anyone wearing mask yet still spreading. Maskception!  point virtue signaling ""oh stupid Americans wear mask"" bull ""this would week everyone wore masks"" convenient narrative distract fact human humans often catch diseases one particular easy catch. Even mask wearing common, case numbers still going up, albeit slower without them. stop acting like masks panacea pandemic clear barring vaccine silver bullet are. 

I can't test all, neither you. 

So I'm going assume healthy fine.

You assume whatever want. die 20 years now, point covid. 

Because walking around assuming unhealthy gonna die, help anyone either. blatantly false We, nation, born contrarians. 

America founded told Brits, ""Fuck tell me""

All major events nation gone easily distilled ""Fuck tell me""

We go nations overthrow governments believe everyone able say ""Fuck tell me""

Now we've got pandemic easily managed simple face mask, ""Fuck tell me""

And we, nation, yelling ""Fuck tell me"" right day collapse nation. there's easy way hard way, we're damn sure going take hard way. 

And pisses end. There’s risks keeping home risks sending school.

There’s good option here, people pick option sucks less based widespread COVID area.  I've heard politicians take things like deadly diseases droning civilians seemingly pretty lightly keep heads cool leadership proper. point here?And data points looking at? can't find general mortality rates site. last years data even there. Might mobile? saying sooooo unsafe go beach Protests completely fine 🤔 Ah! Thank you: makes sense! NYC like back spring. weren’t enough tests back then.

Good luck 🍀 Like snake eating tail. Thats premise mandate. mandate needs enforceable smart enough conceptualize intelligent enough lead household family man. single 30+ women at??! Seeing majority posts sub already US, please stop bringing Trump every thread? see comment relevant all, /s excuse. kinda hard high obsesity rate 30 percent population suffers food insecurity Risk would fairly low actually follow plan (you probably can't BTW), still risk you. Anyone know 83,000 many tests total? worse let virus run unabated? know sure. 

But see, that's rub. can't say let virus run unabated 200 million people going die hunger. decision. fearful stay home made decision overall life allowed enjoy little time left. would take get huge bump compliance go wal-mart. seriously think answer problem. Send health department store fine them, three strikes close doors offer curbside service become compliant. Walmart resources/manpower enforce choose empowers anti-maskers continue act like petulant little children go responsible store.
Not making people wear masks pretty much becoming competitive advantage point. local governments started top problem worked way could work. instead target small businesses already brink failure letting big name retailers pretty much whatever fuck want. Bob's tiny boutique 6 7 daily customers arent causing super spreading events, Wally world thousands daily customers it. Wally world started laying hammer I'm pretty sure vast majority smaller places would That’s best way handle like Trump did. chinese already sold vaccine pretty cheap. good news way good news scientists said kids don’t spread Covid back April 

Yea, kids weren’t spreading stuck home. like they’re causing mass outbreaks rarely symptoms thus rarely tested. doesn’t mean they’re spreading Covid school 

Like everything else virus, common sense diseases spread ultimately proven true tested positive. Weather stay alive depend number factors.

It's Russian roulette, except know gun hand, turn, bullet next/previous/current chamber. Bermuda pretty rich developed. Although economy probably suffering reduction Tourism. Air circulation humidity looked at.

Ventilation key. stuff shit without ventilation virus spreads aerosols (more 6 feet). Temperature checks much 50% cases asymptomatic. SO’s family El Paso. They’re taking things seriously locked since March. I’m grateful it. Probably closer 1.5M reality. Lots deaths get marked covid, happened direct result disease. I.E. drunk driver hits car die hospital capacity. No, can't keep printing money. Eventually problem.

A problem dealt deal with. 

***Today*** tens millions work, tens millions lost healthcare, tens millions risk evicted. need help ***today.*** help solve next year's problem next year. Telling starve freeze street help anyone. 

We give money housing, food, healthcare. give money spend local businesses help businesses stay open. 

Then, able safely go back work deal financial ramifications. 

OR, let get kicked out, stay unemployed, get help get sick, worse position businesses ready able reopen. fewer people able work, fewer people able earn wages pay taxes wages, fewer people able spend wages local businesses. 

Nearly every single modern, industrial, information-age country world this. live near hospital Canada

 see healthcare workers taking seriously time, walking big groups together, chatting without masks, eating together, going public without masks lunch break going back work sick dying patients (there hospice too) 

 2020 taught one thing, starting think global warming might good thing horrific sounds Tbh I'm sure westerners would support system, think also used visible government oversight lives i.e. blocked internet sites, link phone number online accounts (for non-Koreans, phone number also linked Korean version social security number).

Just speculation though, obviously generalizing nations tens millions people super insightful. Busy? Yes. Smart? much.

I'm ex-Mormon guide sorts lot Mormons ex-Mormons alike. live truly traditional Mormon life, going grow lacking shitload basic knowledge experience others have.

I've joked fellow ex-Mormons they're like vault dwellers who, 20s 30s often later, barely able enjoy Sundays off, drink coffee, watch R-rated movies, date want, live open LGBT lifestyle, know people different ethnic backgrounds, read non-religious material, etc.

As far Americans concerned, Mormons naive, ignorant people could meet. that's even radical ones. Minnesota could literally done everything correct wouldn’t mattered. We’re bordering four top eight worst states country atm cases per capita. Minnesota closed borders month ago.

It’s becoming worrisome certain areas Minnesota even cases show it. live tourist mecca Cook County bordering Canada we’ve decided remain strict rest state country due large part high average age completely lacking ICUs; despite this, cases beginning rise nearest ICU beds nearly 100 miles away already mostly filled transfers North Dakota Wisconsin. cases rise county, already nowhere go need bed. I'm tired skeptics stop wishing harm people. wrong sub sometimes? Literally argument someone day wish fucking death people wear mask cops wearing them, departments choosing safe bet sake. We've social distancing since March already. 24% young people experiencing suicidal ideation. us preexisting mental illness even worse. ain't easy. can't equated wearing mask washing hands.  didn’t change opinion. lied. too! I’ve also learned make much stuff didn’t realize make home. enroll vaccine trial? FYI “next summer” means summer 2021 2022. clarified mean heard Swedish government explicitly said trying herd immunity strategy. 

You might right misinformation really matter, that's kind misinformation causes deaths. 

If trying say misinformation come every source blame single group/party yes agree, misinformation come every anyone. need make federal law, make felony abide, get US Marshals enforce. Fuck it. can’t really anything besides take necessary precautions myself. She’s gonna whatever. input. feels defeating. is. Like yourself, Covid probably show house point soon.   Remember asked Fauci shut protests said couldn’t opine do? someone holding police departments accountable. get affordable KF94s? tried Amazon $10 per mask. Thailand here. Similar plan. active caseload almost always 10, people returning abroad.  think governments place mandate masks. believe states decisions. would set precedents government take power away state governments. concern Corona politically speaking. happily wear mask though want get sick get someone else sick. Also places go ask really nicely big deal. Agreed. Seeing thing.

Somehow people convinced Covid less deadly now, based shaky data age-stratified summer death rates, worse, might consider total death rate. testing took place school yard, tent testing people actually waiting outside results. 

People inside identification, testing picking envelope test results. live Davis county. Apparently band director local high school told entire band get tested state band competition two weeks. 

It’s going hit home people hits home. specific user mind typed comment, user kind “skeptic association” clarify wear masks distance directly ask may wish check map - better many places, certainly beacon wellness AFAIK Belgium changed criteria remove suspected death covid removed couple thousands death that. comparable even inside restaurant since March. try avoid indoor spaces people take masks off. Yes, like instead saying US 80k positive tests today, say that's equivalent 20k France whatever equivalent is.  Explain subsidizing workers forced stay home lockdown kill them. Yes, state article, part lack proof opposite. Science sometimes explain things lack presence something. Again, they're saying children get infected, rather **little** statistical science evidence schools source surges UK US.

Stop pretending assumptions even realm careful scientific analysis. confirming biased opinion. again, seem know better career experts field, go ahead, guess. FDA imo done good job trying thing right even political pressure example releasing new guidelines vaccine We're testing like crazy contact tracing. Spikes going happen. Nothing alarmed yet, people need stay diligent throughout winter. Saturday, October 24, 2020

Donald J. Trump: 'We're Rounding Corner Beautifully,' 

US Hits Another Record: 85,000+ New Covid-19 Cases Hypothetical : population density, similar France. Old large buildings poor ventilation. Nobody ever died poverty *caused government literally giving money.* Well we're late October now, we? find sad flair USA. Tbh much worse posters voting thread oh la la know! clearing up, lot people still believe masks protect wearer. I’m sure offer protection wearing one it’s significant enough. bullshit unfortunately, stuck it. Nothing good Lord protect check post histories 94 % post skeptic denialist subs hope fall ditch. Allow insurance companies refuse coverage COVID related costs person found (ie: Facebook photos) take precautions it. thought bars shut city? Glad didnt block yet. 

Again, nitwit facts, moronic logical fallacies. post using irrelevant authority bias. death rate figure came CDC, Mac Daily News simply one network reported it. another article death rate New York Post, irrelevant, something death rate, argument CDC, news reporting it. simply proves nothing dishonest troll - fact, Centers Disease Control Prevention ­esti­mated May coronavirus kills 0.26 percent people infects, 1 400 people. New estimates Sweden suggest 1 10,000 people 50 die virus, compared 1 14 people 80 1 6 90.
Estimates coronavirus’ lethality fallen sharply calculating ­so-called infection fatality rate requires scientists physicians know total number deaths total number people way server protected wear P100/N95 mask, goggles face shield. masks really protect wearer (cloth masks barely provide protection surgical roughly 60%) 6 ft distance shit indoors unventilated space. yeah also korean (not Korea moment though) 

It might I'm open sacrifices collective benefit safety never really found CCTV tracking confirmed + potential contacts really harmful way Utah also overflowed 3 largest ICUs including surge covid units. death rate spike. would go enforcing executive order? Governors mayors openly saying enforce mask mandates without cooperation executive order teeth. French here.
We're 100% dellusional it. 
We're focused ""muslim threat"" country fighting rights draw Mahommet get drunk even kills old people.

You laugh us mind.  read reply comment to, indicating unchecked spread get Herd Immunity strategy works indicated comments There's stopping wave till people get immunity. virus slow spread enough % population. problem sort mandate would sort mandate; unequal enforcement, profiling, money grabs. poor black guy gets enormous ticket mask slipping one ear two seconds whilst rich old white lady Escalade given free pass even blows nose restaurant tablecloth.

It'd end another reason hassle people already rough enough, whilst turning blind eye people privilege whatever want.

Want really impact number cases? Get damn stimbill done full shutdown going starve anybody death, shut everything absolutely life-or-death essential. People work living going starvation motivator unlike other. curbed, measure going partly effective.

Giving small-town power-drunk cops one excuse hassle brown people solution; causes riots unrest. Can't unused capacity. Got efficient.  It’s going slaughter. It’s heartbreaking. live near there? everyone sub appears skeptic actually one, know people sound like skeptics actually wear masks distance, hard time coping social &amp; economic consequences pandemic. Oh you. meant general. Yeah, don’t blame you, I’ll probably same. friends live US considered middle-lower class there, they’re richer middle-high class here. dream always live US UK although knew French would want live Switzerland instead. fuck lot

We'll, least every 9 months. ""The evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. School reopenings much work progress. ""- article 

And no, saying phenomenon observed multiple times settings line know COVID-19, virus spreads indoors (which schools are) people socially distance (which case children), wear masks wear properly (depending first part much case, like Québec), highly asymptomatic often undetected, points correlation definition anti-science. waited inside others test results? biggest concern... Then…. washing hands 60°C (140°F) well? peak county exactly happened. covid treatment might covered insurance, airlift isn't. loathe think much medical bankruptcy resulting covid. I'm 5 kids. Students returned school Europe May surge followed. 6k bed 2000 extra ""openable within 2 weeks"". 6000 8000, hard model anything going capacity soon, especially considering territorial discrepancies hard virus hits. First patients transfers wave happened week. confirmed positive people, also extends everyone contact positive people (i.e. shopped store rode bus) since people need found tested.

From I've seen news, tracing agency's main avenue looking cctv see close proximity positive person, tracking people use credit card identified credit card data contacted quarantine.

The phone location mainly used track protesters public areas people using credit cards cctv abundant. GPS, cell tower location afaik.

I'm Korean AMA curious, know I've seen news though, I'm expert. Tonight I'd say Drive testing, arrive car bicycle, queue up, drive tent, never leaving car, get tested, drive away. Couldn’t happier. 10 10. think would compliance if, way back beginning, ""recommendations"", less mandates. 

I mind mask, hate mandate. Correct, could testing kids often parents contact tracing sick kids go school first place Thanks. asked question went ramble without answering Taiwan solved problem (so far) suffering turism international business. work???? Europe simultaneously less surreal US me.

First really bad europe implemented good policies, people took seriously got control. people went back normal life basically ignoring virus exists despite experts warned we're neck deep shit again.

The US hand saw happened europe, knew coming yet still acted irresponsible disconnected reality start (some people less ofc) despite suffering much never really much federal level, even half white house got infected.

They're weirdly stupid, unique ways. challenged I’m talking people screaming “my body choice” looking masks political standpoint. seem forget large amount people choosing wear masks spite. mandate, wearing mask simply don’t want would call fine. fight law court doesn’t mean you’re going win Deaths lag factor months naaaah it'll come. brilliant. Didn’t give money Wuhan lab research Covid 19? “Wear mask, don’t wear mask, wear mask caring Covid patient.” Yup said this. Like said, brilliant. almost impressive record setting streak warmest year record! experts said everythingvright, 200 000 certain anyways. Awesome work Trump! 

Trump 2Q2Q herd immunity become immune virus.

For example: innoculating entire village measles, means chances measles spread becomes lessened. less viable bodies grow propegate.

It impossible, us herd immunity virus, plenty cases (anecdotal still apparent) individuals catch virus second time.

Social distancing wearing masks legimitately, best resource threat.

The fact beat wall bloody hands make people wear masks exhausts end. Give community service. Nobody wants spend precious weekends picking trash. Think aerosolized virus like cigarette smoke. Remember bars ban? blue haze got thicker thicker night wore on? That's virus also. whole herd thing boggles mind. like saying we'll safe car accidents, eliminate car safety features speed limits DUI laws, get rid bad drivers. Smart play part. energy waste looking people's profiles. think I'd wise waste time trying respond fucking creatures. guess I’m lucky. live Pacific Northwest, central Oregon, vast majority people wearing masks. It’s rare store something see someone without one. reference, Luxemburg's population 630,000 Nope ""because people don’t want pay negligent behavior"" directly correlated public birth control argument, abortion argument. substituting one place support argument dishonest. people want punish women way feel men get punished oppose abortion republicans, vast vast majority oppose abortion believe murder. let video saw youtube skew view people pro life. Go pro life event, majority people women think wearing masks good thing mandating effect whatsoever. Exactly, yes. would trust SinoVac Russian one extremely small sample data released. Weak dick energy What’s gonna happen subreddit pandemic ends? I'm sure big part population is, classified misdemeanor intentionally withhold child testing. include first quarter year Covid started killing people Sweden.

Ahem. God, you’re insufferable person. 

I’m glad really don’t power make decisions reproductive systems anyone yourself. People need start moving shithole states. Trump: tURniNg cORnEr    don't. take out. truly is, know tested positive wife looked said ""does make terrible person hope dies'.

I said point no, really. I’ve thinking mask-wearing trajectory COVID broadly I’ve realized America never stood chance.

Many Americans set routines inherently selfish, cannot move live minor inconvenience like wearing mask.

There various paths success nations various reasons, culturally America currently incapable stopping spread pandemic. Doesn’t bode well next one, it... Well regarding SARS-Cov2, especially infection statistics, march basically ancient history, barely three month people became aware it.

I'm sorry misjudged intent. I'm doubting scientific process, semi-scientific subreddit (covid19 scientific one) I'd like people actually engage arguments way helps people understand, especially come educated position. irked little chose see connection broadness testing hospital admittance rate, engage opposite quoting scientific process.

As verification, trust half colleagues field, extension think judge posts reddit content, label. literally npc holy shit lol see adults time masks sticking noses.

Surely noses sticking masks way around? :p husband unfortunately thought ok wear one aren’t sick. exposed last week 🤦🏻‍♀️ fine close call Ah. Thank you. get fined ""the law"", fight law court. missing huge portion legal system think law fine challenged court. path United States literally choice point shutdown hospital systems collapse (and already verge total collapse). 

This could avoided people literally wore fucking masks. Constitutionally protected individual rights might be. virus 99.5% survival rate. Meanwhile, feel free smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol want eat much fatty food possible little drugs fun. sure wearing mask you’re going trouble. Agreed, CDC NIH made laughing stock executing one poorest white lies order protect stockpiles try lessen shortage. created much mistrust. Wiping work situations, can't wipe every single spot.

Covid biggest black pill, god. r/agedlikemilk heard reinfections Italy city, outside Dallas County, see 75% masks stores, fair number worn nose.  concerning number high school sports practices I've seen - soccer, football, etc. - huge groups kids running around without masks. city advertising sports leagues special holiday events, too. Meanwhile county numbers back rise, matching post-4th July highs. 

My husband high risk, I'm staying home going grocery store taking doctor's appointments. Yet even yesterday found one doctor's office short-staffed people quarantine. safe wanting get sick spread virus loved one soooo threatening you?

It sounds, extreme reaction name-calling, one scared. We’ll probably go extra decorating, baking crafting year. Honestly break constant social pressure always going another event mean time real fun cozy holiday things I’m usually exhausted do. Also we’re severely cutting back gifting year. I’m baking bread close extended family friends, gifts kids only. We’re already shit list skipping wedding they’ll get getting crappy consumer goods they’re going shove closet somewhere. won’t won’t missing anything value next year. mean federal regulation banning weed probably unconstitutional? way enforce business storefront workplace level. Employers need aggressive employees customers, otherwise won’t work. Can’t go calling 911 every maskhole - job enforce basic human decency. agree wear masks, nobody stay home? won't. Herd immunity 70% so. Even 1% going looking 2 million dead. polska muj kraj taki piekny Yikes. really solution you. hope stay safe. buddy deputy sheriff Northern California said entire department basically refuses enforce mask mandate since many criminals let COVID nonviolent offenses. reasoning Person X let jail stealing car within day ticket uphold law person issue completely unrelated. less payback populace elected officials. long ago lost track many studies debunking hydroxychloroquine are. I'm sure Deep State behind them, right? /s notice lot people perspective virus never goes away, matter time get it. masks help insure hospitals run. Like new york setting make shift hospitals outside. That's bad. Instead see something that's supposed prevent getting it, spreading it. dont realize reason havent gotten hasnt taken everybody people wearing masks. Reminds people stop taking blood pressure medication blood pressure better. medication. nursing home work at, covid got building took 2 half weeks everyone it. second floor literally every person except one infected. reason never came room. killed 8 people rather quickly. Fines.

Wear mask pay $500 fine. Multiple offenses bring $2000. Fines could used testing, PPE disinfecting buildings.

Make people pay money refuse let go anywhere without masked guarantee see country masks within week implementing  fucking release think number people without much worse states. people wear seatbelts want safe car, law.

Most people would wear seatbelt also people really care laws like that. Many places summary offense, cannot pulled it, low risk enforcement action taken you. look new case graph, cases steadily climbing since late August early September. wonder why... Selfishness disguised individualism.

Freedom! (to self-centered asshole) Remember White Island volcano eruption, several tourists guides killed? Yeah, that's ten months ago. There’s indication long lasting/lifetime immunity Covid possible. fact latest studies shown even asymptomatic people antibodies 266 days infection. longest period study. scientists confirm don’t lasting immunity, tile frames same. heillo hitler mean no. federal government clearly granted powers regarding health safety commerce clause invoked national mandates. fed steady stream bullshit 24/7 maybe people would inclined believe authority figures important things. Nobody knows shit coronavirus. Yeah. We’ll see goes. It’s long winter. right, ever since banned murder turned slippery slope live communist dictatorship.

Only complete morons make slippery slope argument, btw. appealing argument idiots requires zero rational thought factual evidence support. tested positive really doesn’t matter Eh, think North Korea moreso China steroids. China like....Russia, Russia better economically. let couple million die, faster better, get with?

""Many researchers say pursuing herd immunity bad idea. “Attempting reach herd immunity via targeted infections simply ludicrous,” Andersen says. “In US, probably one two million people would die.”"" Yes really doesn’t matter. think colleges lot well Herd immunity vaccines good led eradication serous illnesses US worldwide.

You also achieve herd immunity enough population contracts disease develops immunity. flu deadly COVID-19, many effects COVID-19 vary depending viral load, blood type, factors may yet fully understand.

Herd immunity achieved via natural infection would require, minimum, millions US deaths. would likely collapse health care system generation health care professionals killed permanently harmed viral load exposure.

We even know would work; duration immunity uncertain. Vaccines viable option unless want death toll unlike anything we've ever seen. Yeah acceptable me. Lost internships took gap semester, pick risky grocery job I’m risk anyways. I’m 20 can’t see friends family. I’m going back spring college looks like I’m going put hold shitty online schooling alone dorm even let live there. r u dum? asked deaths down. saying well course down. Consider minute bad guy. chinese want visit Thailand , take 1 month（14+14) quarantine…… crazy think necessary Please stop talking me. waste space contribute nothing society. Ah group think downvoted post removed post. surely check posts see contents remove based merit? mean dont wear mask corona, easily spread others. arent one doesnt care others rights? don’t see much hyperbole. Guy stating facts known long term effects. OP saying it’s new record case count. It’s hard accept it’s over-exaggerated. 

I’m sure you’d try downplay new daily record infections all. guys nowhere near getting things control.

Like argument could yes knowing supposed original reason needed anymore we'll let lapse. realize people died COVID last several years flu COMBINED?

Sure “just flu”. I'd wager time seen cop going speed limit stuck behind another car. Good luck that, people frothing mouth mere suggestion wear masks. people I’m sure going take kindly someone forcing too.  black white? actually think ppl sub demonstrate black white thinking. Eg “lock down!!!” stores require masks people wear get door pull uncover noses breath easier. Like things, people find way work around rules benefits them. US doomed high infection rate vaccine widely distributed. even many people won’t get one believe it’s overblown conspiracy. give countries.

We struck huge deal; sold millions vaccine doses, money clout. really Europe experiencing worst better health care system US months since reversed stance?  say ""look guys know could better progress good, getting there"" OP. said expected proxy be, tests cases, works 9 months pandemic. sell answer.

Have made progress? Yes. progress better alternative (mass deaths)? Yes. 9 months type pandemic? No. Um February yeah bad advice. ~~People do~~ Governor care long ~~they have~~ state ~~""freedom""~~ money.

Even would still account immunity studies, data getting attention, number cases, amenable amount testing. mandated March Honestly probably little late point. wearing wearing masks become politicized people wear based principle. Trump come 6 months ago mandated it, things might different, didn't. That’s part really blows. us took lockdowns seriously begin with, we’re getting really tired shit Ah yes, good old live free take everybody else me. Nothing American giving fuck people. work college spiking cases lot students still dont wear go others rooms constantly mandated to. Yeah, I’ve become bit disillusioned Reddit. I’m trying train lurker instead active participant. found getting angry frustrated many times asking myself, why? already enough friction happiness life. Yes honestly believe act like children follow small rules crack much worse later blame us yes virus shit get know government give two fucks continue regardless who's office fight easy way get past something stupid went home one wanted around afraid might Ebola. let’s real, verrrrrrry people ignorant wearing mask important point. Like maybe you’d cabin woods since February internet type vibes. This. Germany lucky took sensible approach beginning. clutching straws much neighbours coping better due one highest hospital bed capacities world. work favour long we'll fucked Belgium, given population here, get shit together now. hCW exhausted finite resource too, lovely ICU beds mean nothing without skilled well rested staff receive us. 

My partner working back office months literally reason. city hotspot yet many managers nothing send people back home office leave transport system people choice go physically work. Germany perfect, wish held pedestal much. competent leadership get cocky start ultimately comes us individuals choices made year. And, numbers tell we've making mistakes many countries.  Considering 45% US adults one six comorbidities contributes COVID death, that's encouraging used 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (N=444,649) estimate proportion US adults report comorbidities suggest heightened risk complications COVID-19. Co-morbidities included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and/or cancer skin, based data China. Overall 45.4% (95% CI 45.1-45.7) adults reported 6 comorbidities, increasing 19.8% (19.1-20.4) ages 18-29 years 80.7% (79.5-81.8) ages 80+ years.

So stats things mentioned, 2019. Keep mind communicable ones *before* majority population taking precautions prevent spread.

Flu: 34,200

Pneumonia: 50,000

Cancer: 606,880 (not communicable, pretty much unpreventable)

Obesity: 300,000 (again, communicable, can't spread obesity co-worker)

Car crashes: 38,800 - *many* laws regulations place regarding automobile safety. COVID?

Drug overdoses: 78,800. Again, many laws place regarding drug usage, possession, distribution.

Considering current numbers getting control many ICUs hit capacity, COVID deaths getting ready spike again.

""It could worse"" reason take seriously take action. things happen, *will* worse. COVID-19 currently 3rd leading cause death US 2020, that's people taking precautions. Unfortunately, irresponsible minority (from comments seems might part group?) makes much apt spread.

And long-term/permanent impacts health survivors moderate severe cases? relation current discussions regarding insurance companies preexisting conditions?

Downplaying impact disease continue time goes grossly irresponsible. Well course went peak. better testing medical treatments. 700-800 day still lot probably go winter. Also, cases = deaths. keep going media conspiracy angle. Fake news all. article tagged USA, invalidates happening Italy, seems COVID statistics different per country due high number different factors.  ""Cases best testing world testing!"" Actual quote. “hey! horse gone!!”

“Quick, bolt door!!” 50% progress denouncing progress bad beyond form logic midst pandemic. NEW infections much lower. half rate. even getting about? amount tests April now, would ~100k back PA mask mandate. Many states do. least part PA works well. People don’t whine, also don’t leave house without mask. shouldn’t big deal, fact people really selfish terrifying. Problem people wear masks properly 80% masks people wear useless. Can't second wave still riding first one homie Non-Americans would call Tsunami... what’s happening now? Thats need ""herd mentality"" strategies. Nobody knows viruses *plays invisible accordian* Honestly I'm sure. Yea practicality enforcing becomes ridiculous. see another solution. federal government incapable helping restaurants bars stay afloat shut down. Even first stimulus passed shit show businesses. Tens millions went highest bidder, usually big corp's pilfered funds able get front line. exceedingly clear Mitch Co GOP going let anything through. leaat February anything changes. basically get ride entire winter restaurants bars unable close, afford modify interiors, enforce lax mask rules, significantly limit capacity. We're shit show winter. case me. got vaccinated measles, mumps, rubella using pre-MMR vaccines child. went back university get another degree, school would longer accept previous proof vaccination. get 2 MMR shots without titers first.
Since then, I’ve around measles rubella outbreak (2nd pregnant!). glad get MMR “booster” adult. know guys, I've ""on brink"" good 6 months now. news me.  want do? can't go taze people wearing mask, much would like see wearing mask seem blatantly taking stand 
 fully ignorant.

There difference. fully ignorant. reasons change fact full ignorant ramifications actions. 

People asked bare minimum minimize spread... even difficult human race. Strange believe masks doesn’t reflect almost European countries mandatory masks almost everywhere - even fresh air public places - still cases surging surging ... 
what’s next ? Wear 5 masks 🎭 ontop ? agree. It’s like WHOLE WORLD hoax. Idiots Crying actually stabilizes mood. impression well. Mask compliance pretty much 100% every indoor public space go except gas stations. Still high whatever reason find gas stations one place lot people bother wearing mask. Exacly. Like Biden takes office, suddenly everything get better. Yes is. participants zero empathy compassion feel like heroes posting online one single disease. pat back moral caring people react anyone whose concerned second order effects shutdowns open disdain, often wishing covid upon them. fine, patients perform intubation themselves.  point predictions way off. 

You data back never advocated extermination old people. That’s perverse fantasy.

You calling studies simply ""fear mongering"" peer-reviewed studies published reputable journals indirectly bud. downplaying virus, like Trump leading deaths thousands Americans. 

You call numbers ""slightly bloated"" based uneducated reasoning still stressing importance masks. 

All done call fear-mongering **when that's point study**. causing insane amount harm. shorten recovery times though, merely doesn’t change overall mortality rate. something. pay side effects. world mortality country last year. find sweden : 

edit: sweden tucked ""sub saharan africa"" ""fragile conflict affected situations"" know bad adverse effects years road.

So think nothing assume turn well?

It's often people willing let world know completely devoid empathy people. Cancer patient here, surgery delayed covid. still wonder got lymph nodes delay, pre-op testing imaging indicated wasn’t. Imaging early March, surgery supposed mid-March. yeah, covid impacting way people catch covid. Let know we're hiring California. Usa ppl stupid ones in.my country cause report make true. Eat ass think would mattered?  joke. way mask shortage? Ya nah, I'm getting fact either lied followed wrong info. government official withhold state false info believe greater good. Granted happens everyday, like it. Next thing know they're keeping location certain outbreaks secret blasting churches one... agree whole-heartedly multi billion dollar industry fast food mixed ever prevelant poverty rate America leads unfortunate choices, ultimately poor outcome. said, still efforts prevent cure obesity, heart disease, influenza, STIs, depression, bulimia, Covid 19. Haha. Yea man reddit get little spicy disagreeing others views. I’m pro mask too, wear want. I’m anti-mandatory. see stupid ""mom code"" leads ""dead mom"" ""dead dad"" I'm major true. vast majority colleagues fucking unbearable. might harvesting 10% 7.8 Billion people 780,000,000.

That's what's estimated already infected.

Estimated deaths today - 1,152,000

Divide numbers = 0.147%

Which actually much less claimed. 

Keep making stuff champ. Hey, trump say we'd much winning we'd sick it. that's one promise kept! /s Perfectly said Complete lockdown 3... 2... Cases high we're testing. many cases young people recover quickly. 

Survival rate high. going change anything. Cases going increase regardless. Encourage fitness, eating right, multivitamins. #1 determining factor regarding death COVID obesity. Corona hardly affects healthy individuals. Athletes widely asymptomatic well prisoners, seems two different reasons though.  reason scared Corona.  Quarantine vulnerable let rest us live lives put entire economy risk... wow price gouging comment *chef's kiss*! daughter’s school’s Facebook way. even mom claimed getting process running school board. doesn’t want kids wearing masks school. sad thing many agreeing &amp; encouraging her.  

Mind hubby’s aunt sent child another nearby district doesn’t force masks rooms. doesn’t believe wear masks. Surprise, 2 weeks later she’s posting FB made huge mistake. son fever, cough, etc. keeping virtual. brother, Masters degree math related field, said WEEK. virus pretty much fade away election. I’m shocked horrified disappointed. hope Fox News
gets burned ground vilified like McCarthy trials. Best practice measuring excess mortality, compare average last five years. I.e. 2015 2019. That’s “normal”. 

Until October 2nd, 2020 higher excess mortality compared five previous years despite great start Q1. much, still. Please scroll table “Sammanlagt antal döda” yet. result go either way last three months. year date, excess mortality last five years. Without doubt. policies regarding covid certainly Well reports long term damage 40% everyone infected SARS. also report 20% healthy young people reporting chronic fatigue symptoms 4 months later. let’s stupid conservative assume long term damage 5% confirmed cases, 42,000,000 currently infected confirmed - 1,152,000 outright died - confirmed cases probably double rate February 85,000,000 5% would 4,250,000 long term damage. Yeah need something little bit stronger weak enforced mandate. president needed make masks big deal right start, didnt. funny thing got covid precisely that, since apparently got week miracle drugs everyone still doesnt see big deal. person puts laws books doesnt wear mask care, would police people care? Cops exempt many laws maybe don’t wear masks? see cops speeding, using carpool lane, literally typing laptop driving lol. really wouldn’t surprised maskless cop giving fines wearing mask. would probably say something like “I first responder hero need effectively communicate stay safe, put mask dirtbag” meaningless circlejerk anecdote. 

My experience wealthy resources world stay home safe, issues it. 

It's working class families tend conservative, believe Trump anti-mask nonsense, beyond desperate keep schools open literally cannot afford child care services. Considering openly telling people they're propagandized, think ground stand talking gross offensive generalizations.

Especially spewing active bullshit that's repeatedly repudiated mainstream virology. asked question different post El Paso. [An El Pasoan replied :   clearly hearsay work public I’ve seen. CDC pushed limiting gatherings 10 people it’s supposed 10 people. El Paso surrounding areas think long around 10 people you’re fine even different 10 people every day. Add state city government opening bars theaters, army base college filled young bored kids culture family oriented recipe huge community spread. go out, wouldn’t even know hard hit yet plenty high level corporations still making tons profits, yes us struggling make ends meet.... think either bringing bad points According American CDC, need wipe groceries. trust scientists China America? would require unprecedented degree enforcement get enough people comply

The key fining businesses allow people wear masks. Thats key enforcing it. Europe may quite poorly time, overall significantly better US, that's undeniable fact.

According worldometers.info europe roughly number deaths cases US, much larger population 750 million vs 330 million US. per capita europe twice well. 

I agree guy's mindlessly exaggerated views certainly reasonable think US would done significantly better reasonable administration. Ha fair enough!

I Alberta. rocks time. mention cell B cell memory remains. wont stop clickbait titles acting antibodies last 3 months that's protecting reinfection Making law wear one. don’t think piece shit. believe gave wayyyy much authority Cheney cabinet. think prepared happened 9/11 defaulted Cheney led us shitty path Iraq. Legally can't many won't. 

Patronize places protect customers requiring it.  must still counting population Russia total, little wonky. Regardless whether enforced, mask mandate takes pressure small businesses. Many would like mask policy afraid customers blame angry. mandated blame fall business, complying law.

This alone would make dramatic difference. People think schools behind are. spreading kids showing symptoms hiding getting tested. locals collaborated refusing take public health precautions. even 460 low intelligence possibly exist let natural selection take course reason lump Maine Hawaii together: putting places boxes, eventually get things similar go somewhere. told epidemiologist Bars still open, Fargo mask mandate. going get better anytime soon. Yeah. agree me, point people taking stand. flex political anti-educated view. 

I also agree nation. 200+ years pretty good run Republic seems like great nations (empires?) us interesting point inflection outward exceptionalism militarism starting turn inward overly aggressive trained population beginning feel grievances fairly resolved force rather rational democracy. 

I'm scared country point. made unsubstantiated claim. I'm homework you. agree. lower IFR bit. wrote deaths icu stable 36 percent bit maybe misunderstood. Wearing mask outside retarded. It’s theater. virus isn’t spreading significant way outdoor transmission. It’s not. Sorry buddy, you’re changing topic easily.

Unless you’re cardiologist friends let examine heart, I’m going go cardiologists published one prestigious medical journals world say.
Having Covid doesn’t pose higher risk heart attack later life, shows similar damage heart age subjects 49. 2 months recovery. 100 patients, 78 changes heart. 76 patients signs cardiac injury seen heart attack. 60 signs inflammation. independent preexisting conditions.

I’ve discussion I’m fully prepared whatever hangups study compares existing diseases. general population who's opinion suddenly changed, US medical establishment's. Contradicting decades progress.

If cause raise eyebrow nothing will. Thanks, luckily add hospital admittance rate, though can't recommend myalgia ;) ""much better"" lol.  Rising cases continued 75+ daily death. rest country caught dumpster fire. elected officials *contradict* scientists. Fauci said shouldn’t wear them? remember seeing 50,000 new cases one day time highs, oh simpler days...

Fucking GOP said absolutely evidence whatsoever. costs little. increased mask usage little, would prevent non-zero amount deaths. Worth imo. It’s amazing everyone access information yet refuse educate themselves. sub Reddit perfect example that. That's horse shit. want people wear masks seeing people wear nowadays piss cuz want stupid shit over, mandate mask usage leader country largely responsible misleading people subject.   It’s political, that’s angle republicans took. made political, disregarded experts medical professionals. shouldn’t political, is. Mask use little impact US Europe. doesn’t hurt use them, mandate going inflame people little impact. It’s spreading small gatherings inside people’s homes multi-family living situations. Well yes. busy means social distancing wear mask. Thank tips! believe allergies due ragweed, common pollen source live fall (MO). I've since young. look meds soon get income. :) like “I work rules” actually ended putting one daughter put one without asking. 

Super nice guy who’s helped contracting stuff work pre-Covid, didn’t surprise me. know he’s Trump guy, appreciate able respectful conversations people think different me. stay home buddy, perfectly legal stay basement. outdoors yesterday open air field two women walked fifteen feet away pulled shirts mouth nose friend walked. felt bad people like suffering whatever mental illness we're going call panic. Yes. Public health absence illness. I've always agnostic. tried respectful religion, damn current crisis politically epidemic proven religion really bring worst people. Well, way differentiating 2020 massacre 2021 bloodbath. Cops allowed speed duty. friends family members. definitely better position. large rise daily cases probably see deaths go weeks. steamed hams? Corticosteroids probably. ""live fear"".

a notion pushed ardently people fearful others insist must allowed carry firearms churches. one takes seriously end day, regardless political affiliation. failure political system, failure American culture too. T-cells create antibodies, they? Edit: 2% watched die miserably disease would make compelling argument. mention ones survived were. Fuckin seriously 

It absolutely infuriating. 16 year old probably would handled pandemic better know who.

I’m politician it’s exactly science- listen top scientists apply knowledge grounded specific data. 


My son sent back- even week shut school two weeks 2 confirmed cases

+

You also type parents probably anti maskers- *deliberately* giving fuck whole thing. makes risk even greater sending kid school. 

And since son exposed there’s terror “what it” “will die?” reports completely healthy people fucking dying shit painfully lengthily. Like one guy what? 43 broadway... basically 90 day death sentence him. Luckily got tested negative COVID. 

It recipe disaster. disaster have- shit going get worse worse, many deluded, Dunderheaded Americans think shit pass like flu season- even though we’re snowballing case #s break records every two weeks it’s news. better buckle up- point think US pushing heard immunity saying “fuck it”. literally willing kill children negligence stay home children. keep plants open, though risky. cut supply chain could devastating areas supplied plant. It’s pointless lockdown people you’re trying save starve death. even going agaisnt idea lockdowns. Never people blase catching pneumonia possibility significant respiratory difficulty. fuck would roll dice that?

Just baffling. 17,568 cases equal 491,000 US cases, get thing down, quick Fucking Americans lmao outbreak worsened again, I'm going dine anytime soon. live SE Michigan btw. positivity rate Covid-19 tests passed 5% past days. bad nearly bad states 10%+ positivity rates. We're going get - that's certain Republicans State relaxed restrictions. Walmart regularly shop dropped mask requirement days ago. need go back curbside pickup shop Walmart stop shopping there. US, would have. read someone Washington planning move Idaho lockdown place they're feeling oppressed Washington wear masks. Oh irony Fucking WHAT? countries they'd fine public without one. Maybe $30 fine would pretty cool. maybe fine sherrifs chiefs refuse enforce it. might kids get rid parents Misinformation? That's common sense. new virus course would higher mortality rate vaccinated. I'm saying chances killing healthy person pretty close influenza. far contagious flu obvious kills higher chance spreading Oh ho ho ho ho no! Patented Skinner burgers, old family recipe! I'm calling BS then. got back CO trip everywhere Ft. Collins Springs. single business entered people wearing masks. never bore child education complete. Make right choices life easier. I'm unsure continue this.

There convincing either one us opposing side.

I believe God science, believe science shows end result random events survival fittest.

That's fine.

We entitled beliefs (and believe 1000% evolution) honestly get it. enforce seat belt laws? DUI's? personal freedom let people drink drive? fuck different spewing deadly virus clouds people's faces?? start end dates suggest? could tie funding. state get billions covid relief mandatory enforced mask mandate. live Florida fiancé takes care/helps semi-independent grandmother. ago like months around beginning middle first peak doctor wasn’t wearing mask said coughing assured wasn’t corona. pretty sure anything short N95 mask almost useless. may stop droplet spread someone coughing it’s stopping virus breathed out. Thank insight, Catshit-Dogfart Yes. published confirmed infections deaths only. don’t adjust anything. 

That doesn’t mean misleading all. It’s adjusted IFR studies do.

I’m sure arguing facts. said fact. want argue restrictions necessary lower IFR(under 1% possibly .5%) fine. don’t say death rate “worst case” .9%....IFR 70+ age bracket. don’t disagree, saying “I everything right still caught covid” ignores contact another household. Except statistically don’t that’s real reason people arnt taking seriously likely don’t know someone SERIOUSLY affected virus. Everyone point knows someone it. also people asymptomatic mild symptoms. It’s tough show people numbers say “this what’s happening” people don’t see results irl themselves. Bunch Clevons, amirite? T-cells give immunity though, make disease less severe see. 
You know, hamburgers quite similar ones Krusty Burger. hate us  *Thanks, Obama* literally living rock?

He admitted statement response PPE shortages try keep “we people” buying every mask ....just like TP. That’s it. He’s record admitting that.

Get fuck it. isn’t Jan/Feb/March. Things changed. know wearing nearly sort face covering better none all. Use current information, outdated crap retracted months ago. know idea natural selection lack thereof negatively affecting intelligence average person first world countries prevalent amongst redditors.

It's simply objectively wrong proven again, people ignore facts? idea stupid outbreeding smart feels right them? they've seen idiocracy once? 

Anyone ounce intellectual integrity abandoned idea long time ago. Stop delusions, know without health care system deal illness people die homes create super bugs. Laws, stop people honest. Everyone reason head wear one, speed, drugs, support prostitution, steal. one wakes thinking bad guy. r/whoosh Lmao...yup death thing matters. Nothing else matters. quality life anything. 

Taking risks novel virus stupid. American response COVID pure stupidity. Oh Utica, no, Albany expression educate police? Normally isn’t pandemic Yes agree could change time Trump's leadership!! Woooooooo!!! Thx! Interesting. best medical treatment chronic brain inflammation damage?  don’t kids, you? good news you! Coronavirus responsible death .06% school age children 2020, meaning infection statistically unlikely permanently remove children. first wave mostly alot symptoms tested. would contribute higher fraction then. Sorry can’t figure point. Imagine fat idiot telling nation we're rounding corner expecting get re-elected. 39 Million known without adverse effects. certainly is.

Not mention estimated 200-300 Million people fully asymptomatic never even realized it. 

Or like spreading fear? Yeah high level freedom privacy holding europe back pandemic. trusts average citizen sensible, knowledgeable what's good everyone.

But significant portion care own. Many take freedom granted, without thinking responsibility. pandemic even small portion would invalidate everyone else's effort. assure governments going willing keep restrictions widespread distribution vaccine, people aren’t going distance mask anymore. Nobody’s going stop living life. Really? Well, I'm Utica, I've never heard anyone use phrase ""steamed hams."" see people wearing masks everywhere go live fairly conservative part Texas. still people getting infected. Citation needed Thank rational, non political, common sense backed stats. Actually joke people love me. personal favorite: raw numbers instead per capita, like every statistic. Antibodies go away 3-4 months, t-cells don't. immune without antibodies body. Equal 108,000 US cases  end wave implies number daily cases dropped continued decline towards daily cases occurred peak. Instead see US decrease peak maintain higher level daily cases previous peak. contrasts Europe saw spikes followed daily cases roughly equivalent prior peak. Colorado tried declaring war viruses? 100% correct. 99.8%. Third times charm Upstate new york? scary know someone who's nurse says ""only drug addicts old people die COVID. govts release new flu every year sell vaccines."" goal minimize spread vaccine... explain adult October  national guard deployed

no. jesus, stop nonsense. Hyperbolic response way go. all. Fuck anyone blindly children cries struggles raising zero clue children requires time, money sacrifices. may hundred deaths per day now, May nearly thousand deaths per graphs... see number confirmed cases much higher now, yet number deaths nowhere near was. would still expect increase due lag, much looks like fatality rate lower second wave first.

That makes sense doctors learned hell lot works much better treating disease time. used powers. make shit worse. He's used powers force meat packing plants stay open, ordered ventilators, ppe, sanitizer disinfectants. actively trying kill people KNOWS bad is, rather economy limp along take hit revover quicker. 

You claim know much, give wild unsubstantiated predictions falsely claim emergency powers havnt beem used. fucking stealing supplies states pass boot lickers sell back massive  \~1/4 population antibodies statistical study done summer Russia already passed first peak May two weeks ago. cases deaths too.  also realtor carry disposables me. require masks person interactions. protect rest clients, well family. one client throw fit ended referring her. shit joke I'm spreader. Well yeah virus always going around. It’s endemic.

Will disrupting life? Doubtful.  “supposeds”. vaccine another goal post, another. Meanwhile lives ticking away one day time. surviving, it’s living. Yes, mentioned France, hit 83,000...

How many dead France?

Why FUCK competition you?  TBF, one countries leading infections disease experts 'clearing confusion' American people. Uh-huh. Uh, region? one sub seems believe people actually die lack money. wildly touch it'd funny incredibly sad. Refuse patient transfers. think way, don’t BRING YER DEAD! we're completely fucked dude there's lot ground building false hope people deliberately preying anxiety clicks expected 9/11 kind rallying effort.

""Fool once"" can't blame folk gathering socially distanced night restaurant encourage mass gathering people social distancing. say BLM encourage people break lockdown rule's myopic. Flumami Hang :( read good book GOP Jesus learn selfishly spitefully kill hundreds thousands Americans? That’s straight false, protests (which it’s allowed happen) almost everyone wore masks know it, even Peronists wore them. America genocided committed atrocities towards people well man. fml... 😤 Flunami God bless northeast, I’m staying day die (penniless). wife's boss house guest came work last week. tested positive week. pretty sure wife screwed. co-morbidities REALLY screwed.

I wanted play Cyberpunk 2077 :( flat - flat upward trend, 45 degrees. article false. partner told stop saying worst coming.

So guess I’m saying anything. What's wrong headline? misleading build false hope people.  It’s winter flu season it’s unexpected. I’d bet you’re asshole feels like mother’s deserve kid matter circumstance? Fuck off, put multiple lives risk. Rounding corner guys! Smh “WE’RE #1! WE’RE #1!” *gurgling choking sounds* ""plexiglass expensive"". 

It's pennies compared medical expenses related COVID. see haven’t met anyone bankrupted medical bills sad sounds, don’t think biggest problem deaths. lasting effects people going us long time. people know personally who’ve least 3 dealing issues caused virus months later. One, SIL, scarring lungs sent ER difficulty breathing 2 occasions far. got July... Make America Greater France vaccine getting approved November vs December vs early January may even matter much anyway. limitation right supply, regulatory approval. Hopefully gets approved Christmas, people vaccinated Christmas. true. ifr cfr mean layperson? young doesn’t guarantee anything idiot. Healthy people 20s died it, besides get may infect people may die it. Omg! best! Found new uniform pandemic! pockets! 😍 Oh wow, know flu enjoyed cold environments, thought people staying inside close made winter infectious. even lockdowns helping virus huh? scared, people going get what's coming them. you, take care responsibly enjoy winter, deserve sLoW tEsTiNg pLeAsE! refuse mix politics like US has, country Australia starting to. 

Call is, two feet stand on. Whichever group is, went protested 100s 1000s, spread virus. end. people say BLM spread virus, empowers nutsos side wear masks. Stop it. Plague rats fascist. TRUMPETS DISGUSTING LOWLIFES Funny protesting today month ago. Thousands people cars single mask sight. Um thought making America great Basically. Doom gloom gets clicks gets people talking. MURICA MURICA MURICA 

USA USA USA Guess ""rounding curve"" looks like. American Exceptionalism. Generally stop illegal gatherings often easily organised done night. probably best way, help. Anerica keeps winning Wear mask mother fukers. dad's knee surgery danger cancelled people wearing fucking masks Alright, I'm committing somewhat faux-pas internet stranger another - heavily recommend acquisition Vitamin D3, milk, apple cider vinegar, bacon fatty meats, Optizinc (or equivalent zinc supplement). 

Drink 5mL apple cider vinegar every meal. strengthens stomach acid. acid do, honest. acidity allow release bile (which alkaline). stomach acid weak, bile released sufficient volumes.

Add bacon fatty meats meal, fats available digestive tract. Fats also trigger bile release, breaks fats.

Take vitamin D3 meals. Vitamins E K fat soluble vitamins dissolve fats, get absorbed body transported fats. Vitamin D3 stimulates immune system also 20x calcium absorption food.

Drink milk meal taking D3. Feed calcium body.

Take Optizinc meal (otherwise, could headaches). Zinc another mineral stimulates immune system.

Good luck. part regimen I've put family on. full double wave across land! mean? we're number one! Youre mother doctor understand article March 30 wild estimate total deaths (100-200k), right? even qualifier, we're done disease we've already shot past 200k. exactly think proves? sorry, yes is. state left ot decide want corona. like country. denisty, population, miles, size, landmass. europe waaaay worse. huh?

this covid related.. 2010

&amp;#x200B;

Vitamin immune system: new perspectives old Isn’t infuriating? get mad coming You’ve already told come actually prioritize you. It’s hard, stop going goddamn time acting like everything normal come Christmas. Yeesh here. going go Vietnam lifetime months long break hesitant go ""in case spreads there"" boy huge mistake. state leaders need held accountable responsible.  Federal government little control. Thanks man. updooted people sub agaisnt science wont reflect comment. Thanks again. Super cute Relax snowflake. Well 200k deaths way things trending, millions American deaths *definitely* shut entire economy cause massive emotional lifelong issues we, country, never recover from. really dependent state. NYers get covid test free even need show symptoms. got results back 24 hours. O-H! Thank first award! it’s happening tomorrow, [here’s info English  everything right, masks, 100% haven’t done anything restaurants etc

This live life unconcerned well being. get hit, fully anticipate given rate pandemic, get hit. 

I take precautions protective gear short that... gonna stop living life shelter place. Oh daily record breaking phases again. fear havnt seen anything yet... First provinces, provinces im call “el interior” started opening (Argentina “federal” republic provinces **some** autonomy), went phase 1. Buenos Aires one slightly opening, it’s still strict tight lockdown.  really isn't. People reddit jump America's throat literally anything. entire thread bashing Americans using metric system. petty dumb. Anything relates remotely American culture shit redditors reason ""America bad, Europe good"".

Every country problems. think European Utopia countries struggle free problems, delusional. Belgium, basically government two years. family NL major issues government too. make okay blatantly hate country citizens reason. Holy shit.... fucking absolute cunt.

Best wishes gf. Hope guys get safely. Ah first sub novel coronavirus, many posters followed news early actually migrated original sub. remember outrage hesitated declaring PHEIC, reporters went missing without explanation, countries started shutting borders, China NHC reported backlog 14k cases.

Due growing interest, mods essentially split original sub three: r/China_Flu relaxed discussion, r/Coronavirus general news stricter moderation, r/COVID19 scientific discussion. first since March, quickly devolved conspiracy theories sub grew exponentially popularity. Winning!!!! equivalent testing place first lockdown, would seen 250k per day IMO.  too!  Spreading articles like fuels misconception people collectively take precautions. lot highly uneducated ignorant individuals Reddit inspired articles like continue taking global pandemic seriously. We've ""rounded curve"" many times feels like we're going fucking circles. sister lives parents, mom cancer survivor, sister keeps going every fucking weekend, live Florida open 100% capacity DeSantis worthless fucking Trump cultist.

My sister quit job coworkers would ridicule taking pandemic least bit seriously.

I'm terrified mom going die sister cares affects directly literally cannot handle seeing boyfriend 12 hours row. think Asia already used wearing masks public, probably helped lot.

Here Australia mass breakout Victoria families stop visiting extended families told breakout quarantine.

We've got back single digit cases daily 2 months.

Despite peaks ~700 harsh lockdowns, people STILL refuse wear masks properly wear all. France reports biggest increase record! Since yesterday ! Pepperridge farm remembers I'm boat. 

It's strange see irresponsibly loved ones act something like this. People otherwise seemingly normal, rational, loving people reveal shitty parts personalities. someone comes country took virus - social distancing cleaning surfaces/wearing gloves important ways eliminate spread. Masks simply last ditch effort folks wanna stay away buddies. Stay 6 feet apart avoid directly touching things (and course wear mask) often possible able drop infection risk basically nil, even idiots around taking precautions. Kill steak* NIH Director Collins: i'm optimistic we'll least vaccine approved end year, course there's still chance could longer

CNN Headline: VACCINE MIGHT APPROVED 2020

can't fucking make shit mo testing mo cases mo fear mongering I'm sitting waiting expecting sick next days shitty coworker lies Gosh, hope so.

I wish right wrong, really do. do. statesn control experts making recommendations. http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/the-reason-for-the-season-why-flu-strikes-in-winter/ good news able pay student debts Christmas sweet inheritance money 🤒💀💀💰💰💰 ""Just chiming in"" ass, reply super manipulative lol That’s true bit early say seasonal illness actually. predicted would least “waves” weather would likely impact case numbers especially winter cold air preserve airborne virus longer duration. mean seasonal, take years see COVID seasonal like Influenza. AHH school going break thanksgiving coming back till february think odds pretty good shut view, argentinians staying home time lockdown? Also, wearing masks? 

*Genuine curiosity... Honest question wearing masks since february? weren’t cases US (officially) March CDC didn’t recommend masks April. obviously right move work healthcare something widely known masks way go? USA USA Please come Maine.  y’all think drastic increase Halloween night? lucky get go right everything started shutting becoming unsafe. Sure, may around back then, blissfully unaware. even Disney open way would go. USA! USA! USA! :( use time stone undo crap? Canada here. Looking around world even home, pretty obvious even following expert advice marginal impact ability airborne virus spread. 

Everyone, everywhere, fucked winter. fool thinking anything warm weather seasonal patterns much stop this.

Wear mask, avoid groups, can. realistically - we're getting covid winter. think people put way much weight Trump, symptom problem itself. cannot affect whole world. #WINNING Source? feels clammy Best wishes homie. Hope get shit. Tyranny It’s crazy rest world facing second waves yet USA still first wave. Trump truly moron. quite ironic moron Wales translates carrot 🥕 functionally work landlocked state shares border 6 states (counting NM)? would movement goods work? imagine 8, one died, one seems chronic problems. correct assumption, therein lies rub guess. least fewer people hospitalized COVID nowadays die March April. die, that's horrible trend. Hospital trends keep eye state (Georgia). We've pretty flat month, I'm worried going start spiking soon. remember someone week two saying something like ""why deaths decreasing Florida they're increasing California?? thought masks worked!!"" attempted compare raw numbers, kind similar, forgot California twice many people. One friends posted today hospital 85% capacity St. Louis. flu season hasn’t hit here. 903 Yesterday.

229,284 total.   
Also anyone wants see Texas’ hospitalization numbers throughout pandemic, go following link click Texas. peaked 10,000 hospitalizations late July / early August. Texas definitely upward trajectory again. never economy. wasn’t ever “Save People vs Save Economy.” “Powerful People want scrap country parts don’t care quarter million deaths path it.” Recommended wearing masks sex btw argument point. concerns previous cases things worsened clear interventions anyway discussed: first lockdowns, mask mandates. we're heading third spike without clear path get things control nationwide. feels like we're much worse wave winter holidays coming. Shhhhhh don’t like word IFR ;) mom beginning last week dropped days weekend failed mention live BF waiting test said BF. idea even potential issue went life.

So ""do everything right"".

Because high risk thing omitted.

Reminds misinformation back April, kept saying biggest group people caught covid ones stayed home go out, essential workers fine.

Then turns people considered ""only went little bit"", invited people over, considered ""staying home time"".

You mingled someone high risk. That's ""doing everything right"". fault? No. please stop making sound like ""doing everything right"" means still get COVID. 

That's idiots bars parties thinking. everyday environmental science classes talk climate change :( Also half million February rather conservative, pun intended. finally reason use hotel safe. Yup it’s clear states holding pattern...most can’t financially afford roll things back, people working, people things. 

I think US trying ship goes wave without capsizing. could locked month summer, school, go outside chill, would mostly contained hot spots. one chance blew it. would nice science worked nice, predictable, linear paths. would much easier manage, funding would less problem. Unfortunately, ever seem work way. really know when, even if, new result useful.  

Considering lot people focused trying prevent infections particular virus, lot people might want use result. help predict successful. Throwback Andrew Cuomo calling students studying abroad South Korea back like New York City wasn’t become worst hit location world March. idea read Russian accent. USA! #1! USA! #1! USA! #1! send thots, need Good luck guys! Stay safe remember training. Lol since comment 1 38.

But agree you. North Dakotan here, lying keep people moving . asymptotic

sorry never quite get value one quits bones's wild ride think point 

(healthy) people want get

and get it.

and join (corrected unreported) 60 million already recovered. live New Brunswick, Canada, population similar North Dakota landmass smaller. total 324 cases 3 deaths since began. North Dakota 36,000 cases 440 cases. absolutely blows mind. Recently?  fucking idiot.  /s referring ""China virus"" blame things are

🙃 🙃 🙃 🙃 Weird considering US president said they're rounding turn covid. doesn't? Thats plan dunno.

1. conventionally attractive Korean standards?

2. speak Korean?

3. university degree practical subject? say beginning November. ended 80 today. least could troll understand troll, seems reasonable even that. Exactly. Show big scary number cases leave fact higher higher percentage people recover. propaganda omission complete story. Lol goodbye USA see theres vax. One day, it’ll like miracle.  live New Brunswick, Canada, population similar North Dakota landmass smaller. total 324 cases 3 deaths since began. North Dakota 36,000 cases 440 cases. absolutely blows mind. Celebrities: ""We're together"" [Roger Wicker] ( added list? know, least gave $4,000 toilet paper. There's great saying golf: ""the practice, luckier get."" MO, confirm. Gov Parsons Trump-lite.

I hand Podunk County health department, though. They're stellar job dealing Covid. bad actual inhabitants county piss protect others. Gonna Dakota-style ""fuck you, trace yourselves"" moment bit. great. Shows testing lot. hospital running gloves weeks. Yikes okay god. Hope everyone gets well soon. Gonna head lot Biden wins. gonna magically disappear. Lol, visiting NW Arkansas: reminded facemasks norm. said, yeah, live liberal city. (can't make stuff hahaha) Wow... complete fucking moron would believe that. mean countries are, far, densely populated? way, Vietnam roughly size UK, little bigger fact. Yet 44,000 deaths compared Vietnam's 35. wear mask. would great everyone would.

 people sub think lockdown five years someone dares visit family, go wedding, party friends shamed called irresponsible. ridiculous act like people isolate years end; ofc people staying home anymore smh I'm Malaysia right week family UK saying ""Come home - Malaysia able handle it.""    

Their daily cases cumulative total since March. USA NUMBER ONE BABY!! (/s) reliant others told USA, would earlier warning, would assisted analysis realizing deadly disease faster.

And team symptomatic virus became political. President every member Republican Party caring many Americans die preventable diseases. take stand letting virus ravage populace, amount people taking political positions things like mask-wearing would much smaller.  something want see hear syndrome son like do. Fortunately still young (30) healthy. Black Friday hasn’t even happened yet wuhan I'm fucking terrified going me. wife since March ex going knows 5 days week kid free. know going get give kids we're done. wife pots I'm extra concerned. would anything feel control situation. honest, someone one countries don’t think guys lost minds. think seems there’s lack leadership level even try combat spread. hope gets sorted guys soon, that’s shit load people sick one time. means perfect still gets occasional outbreaks community. hope guys staying safe well be. Thoughts you, doesn’t much know either/or choice. privacy contact tracing. google/apple exposure notifications protocol, allows both. TL;DW?! 3 years prison mean...if told surgery 20% chance death, would okay getting it?

And death. admitted young patient 20s multiple pulmonary embolisms (blood clots lungs) likely due covid. alive, believe me, walk park. Odds universities get shut down? I'm student northeast bad, think inevitable Thanksgiving  went MLB spring training March 7th-11th. air way home border closed Europe NBA shut down. literally felt like landed Twilight Zone. odd pathetic people are. even year people *can't* make sacrifices. 220k people didn’t recover all. do, many spend weeks complete misery still dealing lasting health issues. may permanent damage impact entire lives. includes even children young adults asymptomatic.

We haven’t bamboozled anyone, you’re much moron listen actual medical professionals experts don’t care anyone else. People traveling holidays, health systems various states stretched reserve capacity states spread load, people still go 'new normal' lives continue move closer closer life pre-COVID (unless leadership shown across country), people smaller spaces/indoors/poorly ventilated due cold weather, less sunlight day outdoor activities/source vitamin individual/killing airborne surface virus, seasonal flu striking combination COVID. reasons top head perfect storm could eventuate. right thing. fair live US feel like they've lost collective minds. Kaise ho bhai? Congratulations President. work though? Yea don’t. it’s rare. It’s professional cry work. Well played! Worked, didn’t it? Wuhan’s water parks open full patrons. Two weeks pain they’re done. testing capacity still terrible. took 4 days get test MN, turnaround results another 4 days remember, potentially saved life old, frail boomer comorbidities, worth it! Wearing mask physical distancing acts compassion. 

Many people seem devoid it. works

I would explain, complicated. reading material want Hey, hey, *lot* racist rallying around 9/11. made laugh hard. Perfect usage *first* civil war, learning history. lot states/localities mask mandates without ""else what"" largely worked I've definately heard before. taught anything, leadership efforts idiotic Americans. There's lot idiotic Americans Canada, scale Canada's populstion death rate still saved like 140k+ peoples lives due leadership efforts alone.

Remember, trump happy shut government wall, forcing hundreds thousands stay home across country, happy use executive powers pandemic killing people. economy, dudes. remember second saw apartment doors welded shut knew fucked America. next day started stocking up. someone knowledgeable topic explain multiple countries sudden surges cases? Mask don’t stop virus. need start putting jail. dont quarantine get positive, someone gets sick. charge assault. die, manslaughter America #1! Jeeze ever end? Biden said may 200,000 deaths year end. Unfortunately freedom also means freedom stupid instant tests Biden talking about... 90% false positives even guy invented test (also Nobel prize) said used bc tests flu antibodies blood. sister got one 'instant' tests , came positive, got actual test send lab negititve almost like he's moron. Without spoiling anything there's scene new Borat someone offhand mentions ""15 new cases."" hearing brought back. Zero threat? Famous last words. actual term [constructive interference though doesn’t feel particularly constructive context. expected 9/11 kind rallying effort.

The sad thing is, got this, least places like New York Michigan getting hit hard early. mid-to-late March, EVERYTHING shut down. People scared started talking about...""Ok, do? SAFE do? get take-out food support local businesses? gift cards? work home us, school?"" Etc. really rallying support, trying figure absence information.

And Trump came along. turned goodwill toxic, polarized political mess. Suddenly, trying stay safe ""supporting liberal hoax"", patriotic duty ""LIBERATE STATE"" force everything back open.

I really hope things get better soon. I'm sure much take this. America voted lol We’re #1!
We’re #1!
We’re #1!

😭😭😭 matter what, exposed. I’ve already scare it, survived. friends exposed. blame friends it, exposed us. idea feel ill next day. happy made this,and we’re afraid. Prayers everyone staying safe yet exposed. Hugs you! know death rate. IFR? LMAO I'm going leave it.. made laugh .. posted cuff proof read ... Ah yes europe government opened europe economy... Lol It’s virus, doesn’t care feelings whether you’re it. entitlement Americans (which shows everything elect, daily numbers, way speak others). People lived attics bombs dropped 80 years ago act like wearing mask torture oppressive continue shop, play video games scroll Instagram. Give break stop selfish, I’m glad borders closed foreseeable future.

Comments like destroy little shred left humanity caring greater good others. Oh gawd. Shouldn’t r/politics?

Edit: r/dramaqueen? yellow sand Putin talkin about? Something fishy going Trump, Putin, Virus. 50 million already voted did.  thought “rounding corner” :/ horrible tiiiiiime year! mask mandate come top (not gonna happen) completely unenforceable. states already mask mandate national one won’t change things.

And people/states scared death shutting without massive stimulus package. Millions already pushed poverty, without HUGE bailout, millions would join them.  Turns corner rounded virus's favor. think know Americans responsible this...  country monolith. 
The virus hit west coast northeast first pretty hard. (Back testing guidelines wash hands frequently.) 

The flyover parts country usually run decade two behind, quite impressive 6-months behind! Well else do? Completely shut down? going freeze rent mortgages? going hand $2000 / month everyone can't work home? going stop time make elementary school kids stop growing needing learn? No? Well yeah, ride till vaccine here. good sense dread beginning. hadnt left house 10 days?? u lose mind? u blow steam change scenery? really spiking rural Midwest areas primarily? I’m gathering.  good would team Wuhan since overall response became political? Especially now. suck again! ""trump recovering coronoa virus america""  Try remember 99% people recover. scary reason panic, especially otherwise healthy. 

Good luck, stay safe, drink water, rest! Wow one got could’ve sworn year ago else what? ""else what"" quantifably substantial people comply wait real cold sets in. Imagine many people figuring job feed going visit family ""hang day"" cause can't actually afford keep house comfortably heated. gonna shit next 6-8 months REGARDLESS. It’ll peak around New Years. many us wider view problem consequences besides personal chance death. fully recognize improvement treatment outcomes also lamenting myriad problems consequences lives (long term health, socialization, economic impact, spreading others risk, etc) headed wrong direction quite reasonable mitigating processes trends politicized. RemindME! 2 weeks. “Check daily Covid cases.” Damn, bust P100 again? ‘MURICA comment think probably going regret sometime soon. Amazing months incompetent leadership mixed messaging do. flatten curve. part worked, flattened curve we'd probably twice many infections deaths now. part problem. Egotistical, ignorant, selfish. prolonging bullshit rest us put stuff gullet talk ""muh freedoms"" family. cake death DT even said ""I think may democrat"" R base listen anymore... 

It's almost like we're living zombie apocalypse. zombies dead people, politically brainwashed idiots care anyone themselves. Either way, outcome same. Orban black sheep EU. think is? Belgium among first EU nations get back peak death rate first wave. Hospitalisation 4k, peak 6k. Looks like 1-2 weeks growth former peak hospitalisation reached, around 2 weeks deaths follow. Really avoiding  42% country obese. Nearly every American comorbidity. don’t quite see point 6% number. We’re dealing 9/11’s worth death COVID every 3 days state curiosity? get complete idiot. downvotes. agree states teachers unions. I’m member NYSUT, work pretty hard prevent lot nonsense comes way Albany. also basically sue state funding order get supplies materials need. people obsessed mirage data privacy.

GDPR worst regulation ever passed EU :(. Please take Ammon Bundy back. He's wrecking havoc Idaho Texas heating again, sadly. Unfortunately seem concerned it. I’m not, bot. Politics Yeah. company actually offered plan Cigna 10K deductible. thank that. Mask jail. Keep simple. worry guys, we're ""rounding corner"", like we've past 4 months. Taiwan never lockdown. Maybe smooch little?

😗

👉👈 Myocarditis pretty commonly seen severe viral infections. Claiming long term disingenuous virus existed long term, simply data. bet Please stop talking call ‘em “half-maskers”; similar half-assers. personality type Thought Half-Orc Laura Bailey first Yep!!! think picked it? would make joke thinking funny. Good one though mate. Well. That’s one way reduce Covid numbers...keep people testing don’t want shell $150 test light symptoms. 

We’re bad winter, folks. Honest question, you’re clearly aware consequences take risk all? enjoy eating normal circumstances worth right IMO. feel bad local restaurant owners staff support ordering takeout tipping generously seems good reason go dine in. idiot internet claiming didn’t know anyone died Covid big scam Science religion. permissible requirement change one's opinion light new information scientific method. Really?! Wow. Yikes. MMR? said also helps. president even wear mask contagious. refuses seen camera mask without making big show defiantly ripping face like petulant child. tried watching debate casual interest (I'm American, worry pay attention politicians campaigns). first question handling covid pretty much said he's already fixed everything going get better right away vaccine ready go.

And Biden actually answer question either that's remembered hate cringy shit turned off. think made money? can't afford keep windows open flat heating on. Money grow trees unfortunately. That's get. Nobody likes told do, freedom say ""no"" something respect, personal freedom, imposing potentially disease-carrying big mouth everybody else. things contained, eventually thing left far greater infringement freedom: lockdown. Why? that's thing left keep whole healthcare system collapsing. people care much care them.

Putting mask slippery slope towards allowing ""tyranny"" lockdown. actually stopping it. People care avoiding eventuality voluntarily putting damned things truly care ""preserving freedom"".

Unfortunately people think far ahead. They're picturing situation someone care goes hospital hospital says ""Sorry, we're full. Go home."" now....but I'm sad future cases still consistently going good news! Parents also avoiding going hospital keep numbers low too! would good time buy stock freezer companies. all, can't pesky death statistics keeping annoying kids home. Use Democracy destroy right. ""Uncle, pretty enough stupid.""


Probably say that.  necessarily even need ton enforcement prominent Republicans would stop acting like psychopaths tell people put damn mask on. Stop, get erect  Username checks out... /s Judges arent wearing masks even though everyone else required thr courthouses here. Gotta love Indiana.

NOT That’s called broad system collapse 

They take everything 100 percent suddenly 101 percent collapse Listen, appreciate civil conversation well. times people getting crucified share different views getting had, happened nice civil discussion like having. need anything right now. Imagine people got together instead insulting one another use energy find solutions help better everyone make everyone happy 1 party. trust man reddit hard place get civil conversation.. sorry late responses to... subreddit allows reply every 10min. Poverty kill government helping people, covid. need federal government step substantial aid went struggling Americans, money grab rich. 

Covid still kill also leave life long health issues, making recovery even daunting. also cannot force people go back normal risk virus, even open things up. still less people ""normal"" things, something devastating capitalistic system. learned lesson 1918. Cities close opened soon harder time recovering people interest desire go back typical behavior. 5 common number. something called max pocket cost. hit that, rest covered trump listen experts.


The lockdown work, good measure (in eyes), (like always) government reacted slow. deaths first wave people retirement homes, generally underfunded prepared. (Hospitals never overwhelmed like we've seen Italy).

At moment, testing high, infection rate also high deaths remain relatively low (altho rising)

I say Belgian reaction monumental failure like alway, running behind facts communication place. Masks useless, masks useful, yes/no holidays, etc... like everything country, zillion people need consulted anything gets done. (Do know 9 ministers health? mean... complexity country... )

Around June (I think), numbers low, government time start contact tracing never really got anywhere, people tired corona, came end holidays start school, students started partying, government wanted relax rules bit (stupidest thing ever), everyone lowered guard again. tiresome.

I blame government completely. People know do, apparently it. mean, really still need government tell keep distance, wear mask wash hands? Apparently!

Now tbh, Netherlands went first wave ok-ish, think they're issues atm. also matter luck.

Bravo hospitals healthcare system. great job. seems world did. see spike graph countries. wonder is.  clearly improvement symptoms.

An improvement probably abatement.

I curious much patient improve released hospital. original post outlined number issues patient may need recover released. need study aspect well.

Medicine practiced hospital. Healthcare takes place community. think increase tests. Fauci probably afraid 2nd wave arrived Europe weeks ago. infection rate increasing rapidly lately. America lagging behind month shit started. it'll probably turn time.

So please keep ""math matters"" bullshit r/conspiracy posts now. Fauci knows talking about. He's shit decades random guy internet thinks enough divide two numbers. ‘Christmas dinner bad you’ say turkeys. It’s simple slapping fine expecting get paid. least county, municipal ordinance fine contested. means legal hearings lawyers want fight it. police officer can’t simply walk slap 2500 fine individual business walk away. would guess would fight reality leads weeks months hearings court appearance etc. 

A national mask mandate make process enforce fines even longer. 

Weather right wrong opinion mask mandates, people still rights. It’s people making fun people say “muh freedoms”. Every instance whatever never black white. absolutely cannot walk someone slap fine without mask. can’t breath defense example. Ok it’s easy someone prediagnoses prove doctors note. someone diagnosed yet. Say emphysema patient yet see doctor breathing problems weeks. slap fine can’t “prove” he’s sick. Yet fine x money day later he’s diagnosedwith emphysema. recourse would have? would come sort formal process overturn enforce it. 

It’s complicated situation. frightening Christmas important people western world literally sacred them.

Imagine elderly couple realize small probability grandkids Christmas kill know even larger probability last Christmas they're ever going together matter what.

That's rough math. Don't. Trust me, good teacher can't beat stupid people. like trying extract blood stone. understand Republicans deliberately try sabotage schools ignorance deeply ingrained culture rural America schools can't fix alone. need deep cultural shift highly unlikely. Twats Singapore exporting lot cases. due masking general health.

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* America corrupt. Oh wow 83 thousand people tested positive common cold scary lmao thing is, vertical sheets heavy duty plexiglass installed safe attractive looking way probably expensive lot small businesses. honestly ""we put 18-inch-wide plexiglass barrier even effectively centered employee customer"" ""now take shoes airport"" COVID. Even worse supposed solution long-term shared spaces. Oh, put sheet plexiglass two treadmills gym, great. Seems totally safe now.

Maybe makes people feel better there's lot things could spending money (as country) would effective stopping spread. Well needs better system quarantining class 14 days one kid sick. Unironically freedom important stopping COVID. you, nuts? serious?? hadn’t destroyed credibility flip flopping every five minutes, people would wearing them. needs replaced someone doesn’t appear bumbling ineffectual. That’s hard truth nobody sub wants hear though. 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! fact see 83,000 put headlines infection rate halved proof. got one statement? Wow. idea type contributions make. I’m talking either. I’m typing open sub-reddit. block don’t like say. That’s people want actually talk. know type. #duhhh - let’s this. Oh please Democrats like Gavin Newsom California closed business ordered masked worn yet ignore Democrat protesters . Yeah would nothing. Stores don’t enforce rules. Almost every store go into, mostly groceries, signs people front say need wear mask. soon people get inside take wear around chin.
I haven’t seen reports people getting arrested wearing masks area either see plenty people wearing despite statewide mandate. lift restrictions like Florida people go back restaurants, bars people back restaurants, bars want. 3 day average cases shut california already far higher Florida right lower july peak, restrictions shutting business work, feel sad deaths also logical thing, open like florida does, better many places people get immunity virus! Much Idaho hate comments justified. Places like Boise sane administration, mask mandate. Consequently, Boise Ada county cases dropped sharply largely stayed low. One neighboring counties (Canyon) mask mandate, consistently record higher rates Ada. unfortunately Ammon Bundy ilk limited imposition mask mandates there

The Idaho Falls Rexburg areas driving big Idaho surge right now. Imagine outrage EU approved vaccine FDA drags feet. Ok, thanks, really confusing. don’t taken stay home Rural areas highest infection rate country right now. Clearly ideologically driven. nyc first wave criteria triage non compliance masks social distance orders non-icu therapy 

Everyone get treated put best effort patient work get better Damn l sure wish ways prevent spread covid spin older people dying home spike deaths suicides. USA USA USA- wait fuck Well that's genius. they're going stealth herd immunity. see reported comments mod queue clearly political thus warranted removal. less clear cut comments go actual thread see going on. mean, possible virus make hosts sick virus spread well due hosts sick leave house (like Ebola) ebola infectious incubation period important reason ultimately contained.

But long incubation period, infectious incubation peroid, asymptomatic high percentage younger people spread regardless kills 1 - 10% people. would little impact spread. totally agree. wanted try bring peoples attention always see ""As number daily cases this, government says decides that"" even though one least accurate metrics give real insight what's happening. definitely is.  realize October, right? think considered, even young healthy small dosing, fatality risk still high, waiting vaccine almost infinitely safer (fatality risk vaccine either zero close it) Second-order effects like making begin question whether blanket lockdown imposed Ontario last spring really worth it. That’s b.s. excuse part police. 

Dealing someone stupid arrogant wear mask protect others time stressful mask wearing public. don’t want stranger even someone know coming near without mask on.

I can’t understand excuse, especially given wouldn’t know identity cop even without mask. They're mandated live many still don't. Good luck. think enough people vaccinated, things get back normal. someone absolutely hates social distancing, hates masks, can't wait burn masks go mingle crowds -- he's absolutely right. 

We're living weird purgatory extended misery people refuse mask up. play cards right, stop wearing masks months vaccine comes out. continue road stupidity, we'll wearing masks year vaccine out. used live mountains NC, speaking experience, sometimes round corner there's even bigger mountain ahead. Meanwhile Washington, us Casino workers around dozens people constantly huge crowds dealing filthy money.

Federally run, shutdown. Fuck guess. add that, aerosol transmission much concern indoors. outside, vast expanse air immediately dilutes exhaled virus distributes away. likely one principal reasons vast majority superspreader events occur indoors USA! USA! USA! Seriously. videos Italians singing balconies lockdown happen long ago. feels like different era. If/when Biden wins inaugurated president country much worse shape now. Trump scored goal War Christmas Per capita important, implore look Germany, Italy, France various EU countries spiking....considerably subtle climb, straight line air. instance France reported 42k one day....they 1/6 US population nearly half reported daily cases, much sharper incline. Oh God need live fear rest lives! least Nov. 4th. disease kills 1% people get it! It’s crazy I’m one 83,000 people. Caught roommate caught work unfortunately. sucks we’ve well going essential things still ended catching it. really hope vaccine comes soon numbers go down. mean it’d also nice people stayed home went essentials know won’t happen know why, laws 7 relatives visiting midwest. Father law wants early Thanksgiving....they've going unmasked. Wife can't say no. Neither us think good idea. Ah, guess morality civic duty fact stale date. least honest it. Go ahead downvote me. It’s still truth. worry guys President said last night we're turning corner thing. mean CoV winter Idiots state 40th deaths/capita drops lower every week, averaging 1-2 deaths per day city. Sitting fine here. Similar northeast. 78% new hospitalizations south midwest, sorry learned anything yet. could 2.2 million dead. 

Thankfully Trump acted quickly. think know anyone real life younger 50 genuinly scared virus Nah forming long term memories  actual fatality rate virus isn’t close 2.7%. Case fatality rate might be, actual “if get COVID-19 what’s fatality rate” aka IFR estimated 1-.5% WHO. even one study .23% IFR. accounting people didn’t get tested. Fuck. Fuck hate see stuff. Argentina already poor country, imagine top? Absolutely disgusting. Sooner later, people unite, they'll throw damn politicians garbage bin. Bruh might well end torture enough way Yeah think antibodies last like 3 months high end milder cases disappear much less time. vaccine means never go away without extreme lockdown, containment, contact tracing. type thing Trumo could never do. 11 months late, sir. Take that, France! many hospitalizations? Like BLM protests? Yeah sounds right! 😂 rounding corner! say around corner either Yep!

And there’s clue former profession well.

And thanks. Trying dial back drinking. recommend primary device

You say another concise thing government do.

Issuing masks, social-distancing rules, sanitiser much. 'assertive' government option lockdown. Honestly, every single person influence tried downplay virus get people protest wearing masks social distancing, arrested charged engaging biological terrorism. means pretty much conservative broadcast media, every single Twitter asshole (and honestly, Twitter allowing it), many republican lawmakers.

We need Nuremberg level trials this. 

At rate spreading, infection mortality rate (which 1% right now), around 2-3 million Americans die this.

And don't, getting economically fucked Mitch McConnell's refusal pass stimulus bill.

Why Americans tolerating this? Bro Well according republican idiots know (and republican idiots reddit) it'll gone election. 1:1 stupid:death ratio, I'd shrug shoulders go, ""well is.""

But people working Target, Wendy's, meatpacking plants etc, get choice. They're stuck fucked people irresponsible, following irresponsible leadership.

There need criminal penalties leadership knew risks minimized them. 1.39 according Lancet study published 2 days ago, fair numbers estimates remain estimates awhile. still close 99.9% survival Aaah yes, blame idiot chief who's telling opposite though eh kids keep wanting outdoor dining house parties really hope trolling, judging rest sub anything possible wife says aboot lucky charm too. Eh! exactly said. Promises made, promises kept. omg feels like it’s going 10k day - days blur together. I’m never leaving house (except vote obviously) expected golf green 230,000+ dead. republican party propaganda party keeps lying matter facts. never said want people get it? would say that's case? looking articles couple stated can't determine early treatment options intubation drugs prescribed cause long term effects virus. course every disease cases long term effects covid obviously same. interesting see newer improved treatments positive effect long term complications not. Taiwan then? /r/all/new I'm little ashamed say read that, though language understand takeaway.

We know naive cells, like blood cells, made bone marrow reduce drastically number get older. Later, cells differentiate kinds different subsets cells. turn ""killer"" cells wander around looking specific intruder (like COVID), eat cells infected them. turn ""helper"" cells look intruders communicate types cells, B cells make antibodies, telling do. apparently far subtypes cells may may understand all.

And sounds like vitamin D, according wikipedia whole family hormones actually vitamin, necessary cells communicate. without enough delayed response naive T-cells differentiating killer cells need, ALSO delayed response stop differentiating - see many serious cases COVID. First off, American public en masse live attics either world war. Simply happen. Next, sacrifices make (rations, war effort, stuff) things enjoyed doing. That's really irritates me, ya'll act like gotta social distance/mask enjoy it. We're allowed unhappy.

Humans selfish. Always always been, always always be. rationing optional WWII, vast majority people would rationed. serving military optional men WWII, vast majority would enlisted (aka whole reason draft instituted). Since respecting COVID guidelines option, huge &amp; growing number people follow them. 

Reality is, humans selfish something hurt us really want take far-reaching efforts save strangers. That's ALWAYS been. HHHOOOOOWWWW??!!!

Stop stupid people! Wear damn mask! sounds like good way start riot true unfortunately. daughter's mom thing May, except bf tuberculosis. daughter ended getting inactive tb. middle fighting custody. Guess primary. Yup, following since first reported cases Wuhan. crazy, honestly feels like years ago Sorry asshole, math.

8.3 million current number total infections america.

1% 83,000

223000/83000 = 2.7% Wildfires happen California every summer. Guess evacuate entire state May-sept Uggggggh... worried future. take half country succumb virus destroy economy. literally takes couple million deaths billions *trillions* dollars economic damage. fucking dipshit argument Trump making whole time economy actually protecting economy, keeping stock market election year dumbass based entire success Presidency number understand.

If actually wanted protect economy American people, would've paying people stay fuck home spend goddamned money get government. mandating masks social distancing virus gone. Deaths tracking outrageous relative we've done last 6 months. real intrigue rests states minimal numbers earlier year make bulk deaths. numbers huge 20-30 deaths across 20+ states adds pretty quickly. C34 US states 1000+ deaths assume fatality rate 2-3%, equal 9/11 one day. Misinformation. Reported. Hospitalization 40%. Cases rising almost every state. Deaths up. happening eight months president told serious went hit golf course 2 dozen times. Broad generalizations?? going well? Middle national park? Yea smoking prevent getting cancer.


It help. think expected given know transmissibility something like common cold seasonal flu could exacerbate ones ability spread virus. believe expected worsen fall significant number experts. think though... outbreak due young people think they're invincible, antimask Karens IT’S DON’T UNDERSTAND! 20% INFECTED CASES NEVER GO BACK NOW!! - -""Healthy"" Murican something countries doing, mass testing identify asymptomatic people quarantine them, instead mass lockdowns assume everybody infected. dads side family wants go eat restaurant Christmas. 25 people packed restaurant. I’m trying convince to, I’m one getting called party pooper asshole. I'm sorry. hope fever comes everything gonna okay! Dear Leader getting made cult anxious get themselves. North Dakota locked 2 months Cause people can't stay indoors save lives Kinda like summer hottest record. Hospitalization increasing: going back up: LOL isn’t. That’s wayyyyyyy high  Makes think state KY. Andy gets everyday begs people wear mask. sad hearing pleading every day. KNOW he's getting shit it.  No, I’m referring disproportionality cases outcomes, hospitalizations deaths. U.S experiencing record high new cases cannot said outcomes. look “cases” image compare weekly hospitalizations cdc source (I recommend selecting overall age groups) you’ll see disparity I’m referring to. it’s never going end Prepare GOP blaming Biden weeks, that’s operate. 10-20x higher first go around testing available peasants like back then. like steps honestly, climb plateau bit climbing another step. wave never actually goes downhill phase. would say phase 2 normal life start come back high risk groups vaccinated death toll cut significantly. Germans listen science?

What 'the science'?

Close enjoyable stuff leave (essential) stuff work, shops, schools facilities, infections end occurring, open? Better burning bodies street I’d like know reduces symptoms. I’m afraid we’ll still seeing like 4-5 years now. shit literally never going end, it? university work currently mostly remote, transition fully online thanksgiving keep students coming back spreading much I'd love presidential vote count, I'm kinda glad live swing state deal ads. get many political ads already, need Trump ads shoved throat 24/7. ""waves"" based mood news cycles, definitely rise **and fall** infection numbers. win reelection landslide phone googling skills time constraints weak find direct mention one people whose job eliminated trump admin wuhan since get bunch conspiracy theory sites lol. i'm pretty sure was.  true certain extent disease lost impact, since gotten used also familiarized treat fatal is. However I'd still risk because, based past current trends, comes waves, might possibly mean seen worst it. son's Mom real asshole use USA numbers, k?

8.7mil infected - 5.6mil recovered - 229k dead = 2,871,000 active cases.

335,000,000 US pop / 2,871,000 active cases = 1 116 people confirmed active case atm.

335,000,000 / 8,700,000 total cases = 1 38 infected. 

My made 1:200 actually nicer real number.  Turning corner though aye Trump. mourned him, turns one lucky ones. Pretty sure like 47th October today. positivity rate? stop testing......problem solved like downward spiral house.. pro mask ... BF.. .I doubt uhhhhh really long term commitments. share custody always going potential hole bubble thought would told potential issue.  god. Watching Italy went reason I'm compliant masks go nowhere except work, grocery store, outside fresh air. like looking future wanted part of. Europe plagued stupid protests. Trump virus?! know drug trial process. implying final approval requires demonstration safety efficacy. B.C. -- Covid Aw, come on. call private helicopter fly Walter Reed get 100k+ medical treatment, say good bye ""Jahyna"" hoax virus. Besides, itll easter (of 2022). measures infectious disease control? Stupid thing say. jesus dude, see ex. hope good soon. Masks 100% effective protests, everyone knows that. went cruise February. I'm glad got vacation right knew shit going crazy. messed bu coming back work ready. I’m given 6 weeks luckily. get it, hope don’t, rest give time really beat it.

I foresee wearing anything buttons zips 2022 soonest. Masks don’t completely prevent it. help. Steamed Clams size entire population Duluth, Minnesota ONE DAY. States fucked. remember reading theory broken soldiers returning world war 2 caused surge serial killers next generation (Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy). wonder socioeconomic ramifications COVID-19 similar impact coming decades. Spoiler? amazes people think scientists know talking about. remember seeing stat recent NBA game NBA shut 40 deaths US.. 40. there's 200,000 somehow people still think scientists theory's wrong. 

Looking outside in, incredible could predict something like that. know already happened China still. *The good old days*. expected 9/11 kind rallying effort. expected Americans collectively right thing, especially since equated simply wearing mask curbing social activities weeks. would easy needed participate. shouldn’t new cabinet hold supply masks wipes cleaners. shouldn’t sit today stressing tomorrow’s grocery run. use pooled testing test individual samples pool returns positive. imagine lot public health officials, doctors, nurses going suffer incredible rates PTSD this. like gaslighted half population, can't good one's mental health. pretty flat. handful states enough hospital room.

They're going big engagement party sister (whose fiance Mass.) said I'm going can't see them. got put told also can't stay cabin. 



What fuck wrong people?!! somehow I'm asshole family putting foot down?!! husband asthma, mother-in-law MS, father-in-law heart disease. I've taking seriously fuckers think trample us. I'm done family right now. busy D.C. restaurant told can't stay us now. Wtf? nobody recognizing death rate IFR dropping? agencies work may handful people work. looking call hundreds thousands people day, impossible keep up. Ameeerica, fuck yeah, freedom way yeah Yeah. Lockdowns leaving winter make (some) sense. learned much Singapore since pandemic began. could move anywhere world would move Singapore. *We everything right*

Did either see people outside household without parties wearing mask? so, ""everything"" right. Difference US isnt really spiking. It’s high entire time. 

Yes peak far, we’ve averaged 30k cases 8 months Yup, remember majority people, including myself, thought get bad would IMPOSSIBLE cut travel countries. Things changed quite bit. Southern Italy engaging lockdowns know health system fail get Lombardy-type levels.

They choice that's going become obvious. really sorry hear that. think got everything right? I'm everything right... think.. I'm sure. soon now? even necessarily need that. Korea stomped curve pretty damn well without ever locking down. remember thinking back March summer would fix corona said spread less fast heat. almost winter Tbf Italy probably loooot cases since testing wasn’t good now, it’s still pretty scary look back lol Playing supporters. eat shit we've got average 5 day we're still freaking get 7 cases like today haha.  Pepperidge farm remembers.  Curve got flattened pretty damn well around two weeks early March Korea. get everyone wear masks, proper testing tracing enforce quarantine infected people. even need lock all. it’s treason, then? KY. hospital hovering low 20s we’re 40 sudden. state spike deaths too. *Atlantic Canada left chat.* Honest question i'm wondering since February talking people: expect virus disappear ? mean pretty clear time first cases multiple continents appeared arrived, clear virus go away easily, sure became global pandemic, matter often lot politicians worldwide made dubious claim. Despite lot things happened remember much year. It’ll gone Easter 2023  4 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. SD never hit 1k. today. course, probably continue next several days/weeks. accept that? wont deny globalism inevitable result, hundred years away worst. Many thing will.change effect things go. r/whoosh TLDR: 28 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 27 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

They're 0.002% apart. Maybe weather behaviour based weather driving latest spikes. Turning into? existed start tge constant rhetoric ""USA suck this, like Europe.""  asked us hold beer. Absolutely. going go lot detail but...got lazy. 

There's evidence taking vitamin helps, particularly already healthy. serious cases deficient, know why. 

Get exercise outdoors. knows way stage lol scald balls! Shoutout 7 daily cases I’d like thank sub helping realize severity incoming pandemic (at time). joined sub Jan Feb told many people could thought going big deal nobody believed me. started, said it’ll last least August (and may have, done everything correctly...) nobody believed me. everybody living I’m sad go 2 extra months anxiety knew would big deal. Fuck. Idk I’m going get chest lol Oh hello comrade.

Also biologic, cancer drug, got several month course steroids, major surgery three weeks ago. 

And mother, I'm staying got home aunt's Covid funeral, attended church gave her, wearing mask staying away me. father openly hostile angry mask wearers. Honestly think I'm fucked.

But living here, first months pandemic, sterilizing groceries.

I might well lazy. definitely fucked. Utah checking in, cases single day today. Sigh. LOL I'm SUPER risky age group, even though underlying issues (weight, former smoker, light hypertension), I'm super worried dying COVID-19.

However, I'm concerned long-term-damage could body. do, think high percentage bit less socially acceptable. protests Melbourne- one yesterday, couple hundred people. Everywhere world access conspiracy theories I'm surprised everywhere. 

Most complaining I've heard state state border closures. People travel see families. Businesses rely interstate tourism (although state tourism really good)

30% people living Australia born overseas (including me), eventually we'll people really missing overseas families wanting overseas travel. usually go overseas see family year stage I'm thinking 2022. We're trying establish travel bubble New Zealand, least.

 perspective travel bans completely suck worth normalcy, otherwise. Suddenly nascars popularity comical. english first language? 49? iowa one without one. kinda doubt that. [courts grant injunction state emergency, suits probably referring to. even rule ability enforce national mask mandate, effect, applies nationally, enforced courts rule such, meaning would onset thick pandemic regardless ultimately ruled asking states take legislature

You mean judiciary. know that, I've never said anything locking ppl homes. Instead, taking advantage residential organization pre-exists every city, neighborhood within. 

I think issue ""lockdown"" different meanings different individuals.

But fair, Nanjing Jiangsu like richest parts China far, like last five hundred years. Even great leap foward, people died. right, miss that. Maybe similar situation. taking antibiotics (there sinus chest infection) benadryl 24 hour allergy pill later feeling better antibiotic killed infections quickly lingered system nothing excess fluid lungs still. Must've allergies allergy pills stopped airway irritation almost instantly. :/ knew?   need really add requirements becoming high ranking members goverment. Either incapable nuance troll.

I remember thinking oh im safe. take bus side city. side city clean. lol  Sweden's 7-day running average deaths 

That blatant lie. 5 deaths last 7 days reported (and excluding typical lag reports deaths). come inside, friends can’t come.

99 problems disease ain’t one (idk, jokes hard) permanent lung damage catching Covid help gains long term. Jealous of...what? Canada's going too, seems they've managed slow tiny bit. 2.2 million minus 200 000 means 2 million lives saved.

I know many people already familiar and/or seen variant comment multiple times already.

But lot people check worldometers familiar hospitalizations trackers. thought it'd worth someone new sees first time. intention helpful, I'll cut back frequency. think id rather toss coin child gonna die catch US gonna hit 100k daily infections next week sure. real case count x10 recorded assume reinfection count x10. definitely rare 7 months seen 20 yet. stop going gym herd immunity anything reduce spread. FYI need titers tested get MMR booster. like watch Agenda Free TV sometimes, [he started covering lockdown January 22. time Argentina, became little nervous dancing tango Chinese tourists.

Masks work everyone wears them, everyone wears correctly everyone wears real mask - mesh pretending mask. simply happen point masks mostly security theater. Even mandate people find thinnest least affective mask wear. form mandate state done nothing certain counties required them? least 19 states without state level requirements. fact good see country building heard immunity.

It's unlikely we'll ever reach herd immunity without vaccine. Still pretty deadly 2-3%. million people probably thought thing right passed it.  changed all, dad died it, really think anything ever change mind. told today ridiculous football game (A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME) canceled three athletes ""caught cold""

It's unreal feel u absolutely nutty use 230 thousand people dying positive point argument whether scared lol would know rare without constant testing people? Rounding corner what? Problem people like saying thing March April May June July August September it’s October you’re still throwing hands saying there’s nothing anyone do. people didn’t even try. gave battle even began.

This country stomach hardship. think allowed go bar little oppression. weak, pathetic, entitled citizenry. people local subreddit talking people need Halloween destress ""just need get used living new normal.""

Man people need fuck noise. Halloween needs CANCELLED year. Idiots abound making life changing decisions moms dads kids alike. worse it. I'm sorry hear shitty ex. Good luck everything Announcements hourly then....bet people die causes listed covid shaving. Cool, how's accuracy precision rapid test compared PCR though?

I hope country learn China's testing successes... testing capacity stagnant now, especially province 40k-50k range. almost sweet 20 year old redditors yelling ""America bad!"" every turn. extremely probable. Pretty much. got incredibly lucky able tweak vaccine already available. we'd start scratch could taken decades figure out. ""It'll disappear, like miracle"" Canadian Thanksgiving early Oct.

I FeAr mOnGeRiNg OnE sIdEd PrOpAgAnDa!11!!

Because propaganda omission complete story.

It ironic story cases, always, without fail, people bottom saying ""bUt dEaTh rAtE!!"" 

The irony *doesn't* tell whole story. Here's much story people talk about, instead boil ""fear mongering""

* virus wicked easy catch

* virus *can* put ass

* virus *can* cause lifelong complications, know exactly yet.

* virus *can* kill you, especially right bracket age co-morbibities

* survive show symptoms, *easily* spread someone above

* ~~If spread spreads, *is* possibility mutate~~ &lt;--- happens, change symptoms prognosis. 

Does up? fear mongering? read article find out! like 9/11 moment, remember Bush saying life never again? never that, name security allowed lot privacy invaded goes now. Travel never same, constant talk ""health passport"" Work home encouraged permanent thing, mention whole World Economic Forums obsession using pandemic chance ""reset"" also load videos World Economic Forums youtube channel. find extremely unsettling. old SIL? mean, say probably get downvoted. I’ll say anyway, it’s probable people disagree me, I’m going say currently really popular first world countries youth totally respect it, may different views.

We’re stuck problem since arrival political figure known Juan Domingo Peron, problem didn’t start there, catalyst. started huge economic decline since second mandate Yrygoyen 1917, socialist **(angry downvoting sounds)**. put things context, Argentina richest country per capita entire world natural resources classical liberal liberal-conservative governments. guy., Yrigoyen, increased labor unions made extremely corrupt, party (UCR, Unión Cívica Radical) increased taxes/regulations reduced Argentina’s economic freedom throughout history (even nowadays). 

Everyone started hating guy, Argentina extremely educated country thanks Sarmiento, president pioneer education — I’m mentioning you’ll see it’s case, population easy manipulate food (most specifically choripanes) fake promises. happened? civil-military coup made things worse, several _de facto_ governments (including one Peron Vice President labor secretary), new important political figure appeared, mentioned it, it’s Peron. tell Peron, keep mind Argentina still fairly rich country, wasn’t poor yet, definitely rich before, stopped “agroexportative model” made us sell raw goods global superpowers. 

Now yes, apparently important Peron guy he? Peron formed Benito Mussolini’s Italy, learned Mussolini’s cult personality political strategies like propaganda, indoctriment, etc. Peron came back Argentina, labor secretary, seems something unimportant, basically created lots laws put businesses disadvantaged position basically lower class loved promises — sounds familiar? Benito Mussolini exact thing Italian lower class. Also labor unions, already corrupt per se, loved bought over.

After already _de facto_ government Peron labor secretary couped, Peron sent prison corruption things involved in, say least. Peron’s wife (who wasn’t stupid anything, knew doing) several “Peronist” leaders, agitated riots Peron sent free. that’s exactly happened, indoctrinated manipulated people protested release.

Then Peron election huge margin, governed two terms two different decades. Besides hiding nazis know, killing communists (which people don’t know) ridiculous cult personality (they created song says “hail peron”, “peron peron, great are”, “my general, you’re worth much”, “you first worker”, among things. also indoctrination manuals schools, [books worship (the Hitler Mussolini did, literally copied educative model).

After Peron’s death, left enormous legacy, labor unions unstoppable extremely corrupt; we’ve socialism since Alfonsín (1983) although one exception, Menem first term, economic success achieving convertibility (he made Argentine peso worth US dollar). another self-proclaimed Peronist government (by way, every government says they’re Peronist win worshippers.

In conclusion, we’re screwed socialism populism, don’t want see beautiful countries going path, Argentina Venezuela got natural resources need still poor it.



.

Sorry length apologies English something isn’t clear! Yeah that's they're testing more. 5x more. much testing last spring wouldnt new record every day.

in fact told people mild symptoms tested, since test shortage. severely sick got tested, ones died, makes fatality rate inflated.

flattening curve hospitalization numbers. 5x much testing April-May, 1/5th less hospitalizations April-May. means curve flattened..so fear monger infection cases, irrelevant unless entire population tested. cases untested still outthere unaccoubted for. spring. cannot compare spring unless multiply results 5, account 1/5th less tests done back 

if 83,000 people get it, 83,000 people recover, fatality rate decreases. even 99% recover fatality rate decreases.

We infecting healthy people fatality rate drops gave virus me. doesn't. That's EU is, idiot. It’s since March News Flash, that’s lot asians south Asians become doctors lmao Everyday new fucking record. Probably referring recent court rulings basically blanket banned abortion. bud light packed bar right now. 

There far people Covid number positive tests. info vital No, gone. fucking thing going disappear.  Anyone else feel complete sense doom it’s matter time get it? like around drain? 30EU = $40 blood sierum test IgG IgM .. results 2 hours email. 

That's antibody test, article says ""PCR"" tests. PCR tests take quite bit longer antibody tests Praktikant, person learning (practicing) teach? lot people variation ""intern"" ""student teacher"" Utah character zombie film gets bit keeps secret others. there's also even larger Afro-Eurasia. Sorry reason America WORST response Pandemic world allowing things like Sturgis take place... need 'Johns Hopkins' cast doubt me... Johns Hopkins also says Covid took AMERICAN MEDICAL ERROR third leading cause death USA... I'm American, far I'm concerned... THIS! convo this. American people bubble long. Nothing ever effects lives. wars, poverty, sweatshops sight mind. this? something affects them. can't ignore it. exactly what'd I'd to. Good you. kids school-age yet, homeschooling year two (and hopefully last much longer that!) Seems like worthy sacrifice keep safe possible.

We video pre-school sessions currently. Florida government lying. one recalls Trump cutting funding testing, whistle blower pointing data suppression Florida, daily cases go steady 10k 14k daily 2k less matter day? read it. study shows behavioral difference two groups dining out. Surely would see excess deaths though. Swedens approach bad enough actual figures dont need embellishment. said would happen day one. Anytime quarantine involved half population refuse participate. moment decided enforce quarantine moment decided treat half population. Lowers official number raises actual number. really disheartening almost half country stupid understand this. wrong. Reopening occurred well April surge. [New York City even enter phase 1 June freedom going right fucked whole thing done anyways.

I'm pointing pure hypocrisy people like you, claim empathy, care people get sick die virus, long third world countries.

Scream awful locally. fuck handle effects thousands day somewhere else.

I lack empathy. care equally people. care call neighbor. No, bury lede. point restaurants especially big risk, activities risk. spray bottle filled 50% soap, 50% water. Spray anything want disinfect, let sit least 20 seconds, rinse cold water. things sit 3 days, although reading thought longer times survival. I'll check. also UV light, special use requires safety precautions use. They’re really dependent idea vaccine fact “right around corner!” That’s bull shit though! There’s vaccine time soon even there’s telling long distributed.... ppl gonna wear mask think 2022 realistically end it.. Poland really covid outbreak till now. Poland lucky way. Wait, see excess deaths hospitals full. People fear mongering things changing exponential growth like Poland now, hospitals get saturated. Rethink 3 four weeks. sure conclusion different. Till shut it.... kept restaurant/bar closed indoor dining. area currently seeing record cases overwhelmed hospitals. probably one places open.

The main thing noticed that, higher cases stressed healthcare system, people ask open. insane. dig saying I'm looking infections can't know many infected, amount testing change values, aggregate never really bottomed new infections. Hey please. I’m absolutely begging make house call mother fighting cancer mass refuses wear mask. Hell, I’d pay give mom fine people go protests eat restaurants food home, religous people go church. coming atheist Remindme! 1 week don’t think even know first case 100% certainty Huh? course spread. reason cases, sub believes course lol  certainly idiots too, least none major political parties publicly advocating masks. mask effectiveness justify tons potentially contaminated waste would like know people downvoting you

Because sub brigaded intermittently anti-restriction gr8 b@rr1ngt0n l1bert-@ri@n type morons I’m gonna disagree pretty smart part. Especially Utah.

They’re busy. future, please use something less controversial want draw analogy refrain. conversations never \*don't\* get heated Reddit comment section absolute mess. Slight correction: trash tier parents article trying keep schools open even cost kids. kid symptoms, probably got school.

This blanket attack parents sending kids. Sometimes gotta gotta do, even take risk myself. Ya totally right. work hydro shop Detroit enforce custos wear masks. almost everyone enters shop type current former degenerate lives street rules, includes lot cash touching, high fiving/fist bumping, partying / drug use general rebellious ""zero fucks given"" attitude. We've open entire time medical marijuana related businesses considered essential. 

It's one thing come social media gripe anti-maskers lack logic, get misconstrued - wear mask told anywhere else go without peep - I'm still tell someone else who's drop $50k cash grow op leave store one. 

Fact would impossible enforce. month seven I'm personally it. guys work tested positive antibodies never even felt sick enough call in. work close quarters share joints/ vape pens day I'm sure it. Plus I'm one people swear back December / January rehab living street urchins. 

And I'm arguing science. social science definitively shows even capable slowing down. Shit can't even stop influenza shots literal decades medical science backing that. 

I'm slowly surely gravitating toward ""team giving fuck"". Everyone going get trying delay inevitable. piece cloth going stop millions years viral evolution. Unless world literally unanimously decided going go week without ever taking mask touching anything, need let nature run course. WA, local sheriff said thing actually want front page newspaper says along world war one two front pages anyone know think cases arising from?

Not Italy, [places infections Currently people get infected home, next nursing homes, work, spare time activities. people get infected shopping trips taking bus seems. sound fun. well prepared called distributing cherry picked data. explain swear involved: subreddit outbreak, political arguments. Please take elsewhere. bit confused, people say Sweden reached herd immunity. that's case cases drop low without social distancing? reckon second wave coming guys too? Obviously read report. Case-patients covid-positive control-participants negative. Biden's got homie. Couple weeks Sacre bleu-dy hell I'd compare nose swab pap smear. incapacitate physically? No. get done lunch break really wanted to. tax energy invasive, painful procedure sensitive place? Absolutely. mention stress needing test begin with. know I'd fretting slightest ""not normal"" sensation body told go get test.


Also, people differing tolerance pain stress medical facility. world already hostile place, take judgement elsewhere. think 1 car speeding ok allow second (or more) cop cars speed catch 1st cause fewer accidents? told say opinion. said, could give context explanation try keep stat people Bro what. infection rate like 1.3%

New York testing entire countries. 

Is 2000 cases single day good? Absolutely not. it’s 2k cases 157k tests, that’s still good sign tests catching cases, don’t rampant, uncontrolled community spread like back March/April. 

New York hell lot better almost every state country, now, better majority countries world. 

I’m huge advocate things slow spread contain virus, you’re going straight doom gloom numbers show opposite. Plenty empirical science studies indicate opposite trend. wrong. low. See reply. Unfortunately happen live state. People taking seriously all. One regions positivity 12% still defying mandate. can't get people.
 end back lockdown next month, people complaining suing Pritzker can't pawn kids onto teachers go relax bar. actually quite pathetic. increase infected people began exponential growth early October. September 30, national trend followed pace settling much lower value first wave epidemic. Intensive care hospitals pain. However, October 1st, exponential growth began clearly never stopped reaching much higher values ​​than first wave three weeks, today exceeding 19,000 new cases infections per day leading saturation intensive care.

The event
No health system withstand exponential growth long clear. change trend epidemic one day next, event necessary suddenly changed social behavior millions people. event happened week October 1st, event involved Italy. September 24, schools reopened six Italian regions, including populous Campania Puglia. others reopen 10 days earlier, 14 September. 20-21 September elections: 9 extra school days, least 4 lost. Considering departure slow due Covid, fact school restarted full speed around 24 September suddenly setting nearly eight million students move - exactly takes explain data.

The data
The data Civil Protection also confirmed data available Ministry Education relating school population. week 26 September - 3 October, rate growth infections teaching staff rest Italian population, non-teaching staff slightly higher (about 8%), students 36% higher rest population. following week situation changes drastically: rate growth infected among students 2.65 times (+ 265%) higher rest population, teaching staff exactly double (+ 200%), non-teaching staff 1.67 times (+ 167%) higher rest Italian population!

The amplifier
The reopening schools acted powerful amplifier contagion, necessarily due defects organization activities within school. Millions kids started dating regularly school buildings, taking effects habits, sports, transportation, extracurricular activities social habits. probably caused formidable amplifying effect which, starting young people, affects, order decreasing intensity, teachers school workers, people live several hours every day contact them, well as, obviously, rest society. dealing happens school, forgotten everything happens young people outside school put circulation devastating effects. October 1st, epidemic began rise quickly, doubling every 7 days, exceeding, October 23, 170,000 infected: week could exceed 300,000, two weeks could rise 600,000, absolutely unsustainable numbers. They've claiming since February though, always saying around corner. Even right, boy cried wolf situation, nobody going believe it. know acting like one pain blaming everyone else helping one guys who's pushing everything reopen open fall, reopen (a little wider) spring. general trajectory country reopening rather reclosing regardless virus does.

If weren’t open fall, probably won’t reopen spring. I'm sorry, find hard believe. countries seen large sudden increase cases right schools opened. Surely coincidence? wife works major liquor retailer Houston, mask policy argue customers wearing masks, want chase customers, go help people first get store soon possible. putting employees risk opinion anyway.....profit first health second. I’m sure brought NZ wasn’t talking NZ.

But yeh Australia NZ really standard, it’s honestly disturbing Europe places around world go holidays return home don’t proper quarantine system. Multi generational homes pretty common Italy think first world scientists incompetent though. would trust experts Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia, China (domestic response, international WHO). example Taiwan stepped mask production January attempted warn world. hand mask use far long. Taiwan total 300 cases 7 deaths achieving elimination without lock down. 

Recent studies Australia show virus active surfaces even longer before, 28 days. world would ""experts"" one simplest, easiest measures reduce risk, wiping groceries.

Define this. metric “under control”? infection rates. deaths.

Oh, numbers. abstracts. message sub. means you’re troll, engaging waste time.

Careful, would want accused Enlightened. can't force states anything. get attempt competently manage supply chains end disinformation coming highest levels. untrue cherrypicked. least second wave here. can't second wave first wave never ends It’s conspiracy theory reckon telling people wear masks March/April propaganda effort make sure healthcare workers didn’t run masks. supply chain caught give proper health advice encourage mask wearing.

That's worst case scenario man, average worst case get give X number people, die, X people also die. (Also X people also spread people die spread it) 🍀🤞🙏🤞🍀 stat untrue said first place. untrue nothing wrong saying matter implies. Im arguing dangerous scary covid is. Im making point try silence certain stats go narrative true. (Obviously stat false apply). problem giving context stat giving interpretation stat. saying one try keep true stats away people service agenda. bad precedent makes us look bad too. people click away get tests 

They die.

Ipso facto cares dead people resenting you! sir wendys Stop collecting data? seems unlikely. want continue monitoring people who've injected. Especially potential health risk. Right. mean, appreciate educating (in OPs town). could actually use cop privileged white douche canoe action. 

Wishful thinking, know. someone cancer terrifies me. Estimated deaths Black Plague 75-250 million people according killed third population 1347-51 applied today would around 2.6 billion people.

Despite killing 1 million people worldwide, Covid 19 absolutely effect net global population growth 2020.

Although deadly virus believe fall well short prediction. Let say COVID positive wearing mask nose. spreading virus breath nose? 

If carrier don’t wear properly false least won’t harm people. 

Of course, one really tell spreading COVID. Shit. even keep closer home. Ever notice pro-lifers also usually pro-war, even there’s little threat security? killing ethical prevent atrocity, don’t see much atrocious children born suffering, abuse, addiction, poverty—basically class people pro-lifers (re: conservatives) spend rest energy trying remove every helping hand from. Make punishable 3500 dollar fine 3 days jail first offense second 96 years super max prison **All Berliners tested positive go quarantine home, regardless whether contact Ministry Health not. also inform possible contact persons, turn also quarantine**. engineers tend vastly overestimate non-engineering knowledge?

(It’s bad enough need volunteer they’re engineer every sentence.) Australian, British Canadian otherwise? there’s suing culture continental Europe (I Europe lived bit over), countries would allow individual suing company unsafe practices, go unions agencies.  Provide alternative explanation 14% increase. I'm sure airtight one. say that, bother federal mandate injunctioned days?

5. Deliver solution customer, repeat stop wanting stuff.

So form hypothesis, test, collect data, accept reject hypothesis; doing, gain better understanding customer's problem domain. employee served them

Yea employee cant even afford fine. fuck. they’ve stated enforce rule cannot wear masks. *should* safe based know simply walking around outside without mask one else around. indoor place isn’t house, would wear mask even one’s around virus linger infectious aerosol particles. would also definitely wear mask going close someone outside, even though outdoor transmission rarer, happen. Unfortunately anti mask people ok elderly dying en masse. Gonna wait January hope Dems flip senate. disagree sex considered luxury, think starving person stealing food acceptable need survive whereas person sleeps around sheer pleasure. also worth noting unwanted pregnancies cause repressed men women barred sexual activity lash once, rather irresponsible people sleep around anyone meet party bar taking zero precautions. Maybe putting much emphasis personal responsibility, crazy sentence sounds, also feels like side quick dismiss it. be, without exception, driving tenet lives.

But said want tell something. probably first person change mind, least internet, something deeply believed. regard public birth control. I'm completely sold, would reluctantly support lowered abortion I'm looking beyond that. Smell that? would think public health crisis good reason mandate something cannot enforced. Sorry. 31 So, hear out: intend make kind statement abortion original comment. statement favor things like birth control access comprehensive sex education. assume decent chunk people support legalized abortions virtually everyone wants abortion illegal want less abortions, broad bipartisan support reduce abortions. yet, isn't. frustrating.

Same thing masks, social distancing, increased testing. Lockdowns happen COVID control, back March/April reasons lost control bad preparation enough data gathering. tell true state things, assumed worst. now, people yell loudest lockdowns also fight easiest, simplest things expanded testing, mask wearing, social distancing would help prevent said lockdowns. short sighted. asian countries show mask part wide range measures gonna work themselves... Worrying long term effects rushed vaccine reasonable, even 30% take would cut death rates significantly read interesting article recently college age pandemic US may linking purpose K12 ed keeping mind too. are: anyone else realise connection? K12 there's similar thing academia reason society expect people physically school despite dangers pandemic. hard tell exactly driving surge right now, look like colder weather may bigger factor school reopening. saying school reopening help contribute, many parts Europe schools reopen longer US, temperature started dipping things seemed spreading there. Also parts US getting really bad right northern half country - midwest terrible things increasing fast Northeast low long. schools play hand it, I'd say based location things increased makes seem like winter weather play major roll spreads most. get one wants die nobody wants loved ones die. virus one calling shots here, best, sadly, helluva whole lot us actually doing, variety reasons.

Damn virus. look full time line you’ll see I’m talking about. Maybe, I’m sure anymore I’ve run ways explaining point. Contrary /u/Sampo says, **total deaths fluctuated 1.1-1.3% year year last 5 years**. growth years, (because normalizing deaths/1000, growth due underlying population growth) still fluctuation.

So, answer original question, using [the data Oct Feb 1 Oct 17, 2,270,233 total deaths 207,876 COVID19 deaths, 9.16% deaths COVID-19. Again, /u/Sampo made 13% [out whole right, comforting, like empathy. Thank That's cool, thanks. He's actually skeptic troll posts pessimistic stuff skeptic trolls circlejerk. Best ignore downvote regardless content. less kids dying, lasting effects illness well spreading covid adults.  Canada, we'll get shitfaced call cab  Deaths, cases. LOL! think would great punishment people certain things make sure never want again. Play repeat 50 times maybe even ten job. Places running 100% one batting eye. America isn’t going enforce Covid stuff seriously. liberal cared deeply subject months ago, truly don’t care anymore. fact, it’s subject lean Republicans on. Mandating masks one part conservative (small ‘c’) approach governments around world taking limit liability things go tits up. argue ‘did could limited data available’ challenged later.

Everyone sort understands mass produced cloth type ‘fashion masks’ near effective surgical, N95 respirators yet wear them. 

I personally think it’s part general societal, shame driven coping mechanism. start pandemic saw panic greed driven coping mechanisms people stockpiling toilet paper. mandating yet? Come almost November go back normal COVID-19 standard seasonal epidemic virus, vaccine + better treatment rolled   Yeah undercounted bunch first Im sorry family stupid.

My family cancelled social gatherings till next spring. big affectionate loud latin family lots kids.

We like thanksgiving xmas, much love parents.

Darwinian evolution happening. Im glad youre playing team. Stay sane, stay careful, stay healthy. Aloha! feel like mandate would make people want wear it. don’t know punishment would appropriate somebody wearing mask also harsh enough encourage mask wearing. know many people don’t wear masks simply told wear masks. forced, probably would wear masks. Combined Brilacidin quite effect So......he demands masks, yet said nothing YEARS Tuberculosis killed 1.5 million people every single year? Giving death rate approximately 15%. spread way, COMPLETELY CURABLE PREVENTABLE. Yet nobody screaming masks years prior this. matter. Diseases happen, people die. shut society shit. Cops absolutely speed speed that's obviously issue. choose least logical interpretation. one complaining cops speeding respond call. would lead believe would ever discussion? Occam's Razor, man. issue decades cops things illegally (and example, clearly speeding allowed to). really? thought ill. PCR test antigen, done 24-48 hours OK enter (my thought, validated) negligence giving medical care? take point reductions still valuable, would argue would still significant reductions order call different waves - think we've yet. personally mates tell life join dinners/drinks /house parties . must nice care 75 year old mother 99 year old grandmother die pandemic. You’ll fine. Unless everyone perfectly using mask, social distance: you’re gonna get it. America really sucks. Yea it’s want hear right. Sorry mom doctor. Idc strangers internet believe not. stupidity balls. countries part society dying significantly better US. Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan..... remember washing hands work touching door girl working kind laughed

look us anti-intellectualism preached way churches TV. wrong people wanting catch disease? ""B-b-but testing means cases!"" /S Sorry wrong here. 

It's something *anything* use leverage get kids purpose inflicting emotional pain wife. case yea he'd asshat.

But health safety child times, himself. 

She irresponsible actions abhorrent informing proper parties. needs investigated whether BF irresponsible contraction disease ( i.e. anti-maskers) endangered child put care protection. Turns people really mind people dying get live life normally I’m grad school...too busy think anything else lol people recover strep throat. However, people take antibiotics recover sooner. make antibiotic useless? Maybe, maybe not. different schools thoughts. 

Increasing recovery time insignificant. I’d like know reduced days ventilator? longer spend ventilator likely potential negative effects ventilation sedation. Hook em straight veins, doc. I'm gonna meetings afternoon. fine Japan reasonable countries doing. Seriously anti-maskers everyone must stay fuck homers equally wrong view. One quick follow up: brought debate COVID bad, think agree there, impact undercounting cases metrics follow.

Whether cases counts 5 10x make deaths (or long term impacts) acceptable means vastly change true fatality rate thus decision process next whom. think like “not enough changed since March” paying price it. bad things going world. thing I’m tired riverycityjackal. clear evidence face coverings reduce spray droplets produced speaking, coughing, sneezing6,17,19,49–52. masks long recommended individuals respiratory infections  many severe cases tho, real number infected must high time actually gas stations since huge hot spots lots people go every day sure would lie this, much less risk bringing entire hospital keep secret well. long allowed leave house? states non-essential businesses shut month, schools closed school year, grocery stores moved limited hours dedicated times elderly infirmed shop, gatherings 10 banned exceptions, non-essential travel banned, quarantines imposed area visitors (but monitored)...but like nothing ever happened. every area it. None ended helping much all. People still left house secretly defied bans. long Aussies really stay locked homes work? manage lay enough supplies? government provide food poor? talk wider views consequences fail go beyond virus itself. measures don’t zero cost. economic cost, societal cost, even health cost(mental physical). debated. political. need “devils advocate” types. Even don’t agree say end.

You argue restrictions worth it, comes point would be. virus .000001% IFR, wouldn’t be. cure would worse disease. want point become worth it? Well that’s matter debate. falling IFR, it’s important ever before. I'm currently visiting area part swing state part tv market. Trump ""Biden's gonna take away Medicare"" ad aimed seniors. fucking sick (no pun intended)  think back start lockdown California feels like years. think June July can’t help feel like summer didn’t happen. 'Member Ides March? 2020 virus doesn’t give shit politics are. can’t negotiate it.

A lot North Dakotans going get sick many die. That’s terrible. 

It’s actually filled old people, mainly one retires North Dakota. would cost money though locked balance sheets S&amp;P500 companies sitting bank T&amp;C. Japan late January, way back home US saw news segment airport Tokyo talking bus driver got diagnosed Nara. Thinking back eerie moment. One confirmed case one single town Japan made international news. can't believe beginning we're now, back would've never imagined would spiral into. thought gonna another ebola something similar.

Crazy. consider main takeaway lessons learn things went wrong Argentina? learning economic political problems past year result researching potential trip Today's 7-day rolling average ~60,000. took 3 weeks 7-day rolling average go 40K 60K. slope increasing. without policy changes, we're probably looking ~5 weeks reach 100K per day 7-day rolling average. Bro, see video returning White House? could barely catch breath, fidgeting like mad, coloration waaaaay off. band aid hand IVs. obviously covid. president, got best care. Even higher risk 10% chance death, considering position, surprise survived it. considering many people around time also COVID, really hard believe it. Well, can't prove counterfactual. US pandemic response teams working tirelessly fifty years monitor new diseases keep contained. Pandemic potentials like zika Ebola fizzle own. People put real, thankless work stop them. again, people prevent catastrophes hear waste money ""nothing happened anyway.""

You can't prove counterfactual, we'll never know. disease worse order magnitude? Maybe. maybe first one hit let guard. Anyone got per capita stat? disease real fucking asshole isn’t it.   country west simply couldn’t done shutdown level China 
 
I’m guessing you’ve never heard Australia before? Lol, someone know fucked courts right now. confusing enemy. 9/11 type terror stuff government absolutely loves fight gather support ie economic benefits powerful investors corporations + benefit power projection around world. 

Something like virus requires actually spend money healthcare help poor? yeah. right. 

The thing point out, sad. weakness achillees heel US military, never been. ideology freedom providing healthcare way expressing true freedom. dont think enemies US watching this? blueprint destroy US. Simply release fkn virus freedom ideology means wont help one another, free cant afford healthcare, cant afford ;the end...one fucked society. People bad measuring social risk risk others. healthy people risk COVID low. number confirmed cases counted less one two hands. sure it’s possible right rate like 5/42,000,000. It’s small probability greater chance getting hit asteroid (1/1,600,000) getting Covid twice. Surprisingly informative! think eventually. bad things get another question. Sources? Important remember high risk groups also ones good chance spreading it, getting healthy first help slow circulation elsewhere. think fatality rate sudden go monotonically decreasing months? Bold prediction Vaccinations already required schools universities varying degrees. nothing already do, many people need disease. one forced get vaccination, choose get it, need stay home longer rest us. already have, think underestimate logistical challenge. first two vaccines approved likely Pfizer Moderna, order. 

Pfizer requires storage -96 degrees, it’s shipping options limited, almost impossible send rural areas. one really knows many doses available, 1.3 billion (650 million doses since two vaccines required) end 2021 estimate. 

Not sure Moderna production, stored traditional freezer temperatures, primarily used rural areas. 

Either way, vaccinations America 2020 limited certain high risk groups, first HCWs (beyond LTCH residents doses available). general public take longer, likely sometime Spring.

In words, it’ll probably least months 2021 we’ve able vaccinate bulk HCWs LTCH residents. Furthermore, vaccines getting shipped fixed schedule anyway, lack approval won’t hurt vaccine availability, we’d ready go it’s approved. long approval early 2021, timeline doesn’t change much. Yay death harmonics Hurt Today vaccines require two doses effective *so* look forward pictures crammed stores maybe 3% people wearing masks last days christmas. Holy going shotshow. would *anyone* want that? Lmao redditor's thoughts ""re-centering yourself"". ridiculous. Oh :(. See tomorrow, going bar. don’t hear died Covid. approach! spend hospital care though. I'm denier CDC stats support this? really doubt nearly 6 months this. It’s flu man, Stay clear elderly relatives choose that’s do. 65 severely immunocompromised good go. two nieces, families, parents well. sister, mother, serious health issues father can't work provide them, like kids. They're quarantine fighting disease. That's eight members family day along three good friends. brother's family, kids grandkids exposed well.

This shit sucks.  India way believe official numbers. Buckle CFR = Case Fatality Rate = proportion deaths certain disease compared total number people diagnosed disease particular period. 

AKA given people known certain disease, many actually dying it?

IFR = Infection Fatality Rate = similar CFR, except including asymptomatic undiagnosed subjects.

AKA given people known certain disease strict diagnosis believe disease asymptomatic and/or undiagnosed, many actually dying it?

These numbers much harder measure early days pandemic, testing really robust. lot data, making numbers reliable. doubt could, considering Florida four times population. forget inevitable backlash election. guarantee protests regardless wins. Haha, every administration world decided pull crazy April Fool’s Day joke everyone. sure got us good! France 40k 7x less people yesterday It’s going tough. think people associate collapse almost apocalyptic. It’s weird get used to. horrific seeing freezer trucks brought makeshift morgues, probably get really efficient body disposals treating people etc. shouldn’t prepping manage way, that’s leadership lead us to, country fine get really good managing slammed covid. Life funky like that.   scares people stupid exist. Truly.  drug birthright privilege lifetime wealth-fare. Side effects may cause narcissism. potential long term negative effects

I think people know that's nearly statistical unlikelihood dying it. aware it. it’s understandable people angry divided. Pretending otherwise helpful. really wish understood much stake wrong. course continue living lockdown end time? backup plan? still wear mask times. catch once. U ! U A! reddit Bush obama presidental planning pandemic appropriately.

Trump r€tard. guess ""turning corner"" could also mean big turn UPWARD cases. knew? That's great question admittedly followed serology studies France much beyond headlines basic research us discuss through...

At May 1st, France 130,000 confirmed cases ~0.19% 67 million person population. grew 22k end May ~0.22%.

Just weeks later, studies came using antibody tests data modeling stated actual infection rates averaging ""just"" 4-6%. line general findings testing done blood donations came back 2.7% end March, month earlier (AFAIK, also takes weeks antibodies detectable blood). course, assumption accuracy picking studies means intended totally representative France.

Still, even take low end these, say 2.7% figure, get 1.8 million cases *13.9x* confirmed case count May 1st. record, studies used highlight far France go get anywhere near herd immunity naturally. certainly advocating good result relax restrictions starting lift then.

So ya, ""easy"" get well past 3x mean we're comparing fully accurate number either.

To point, US, CDC estimated something like 3-20x confirmed actual case counts. Presumably improved vastly time may better France even still, consider ranged COVID cases state testing, seems unlikely we're seeing anywhere near 100% accuracy let alone 50% country major case counts large population. Data points like hospitalizations far telling severity eventual deaths good serology test actual spread.

As ""is 40k acceptable"" question. could certainly argue ""who"" 40k matters, would say certainly acceptable, especially knowing rise. 

Heck, context COVID alone, 10k even 1k also unacceptable. However, since unlikely see France country already generally minimized virus take steps so, answer line lies far broader context life get effective vaccine, whenever may be. that's whole post conflicting impacts human's dismissal chronic issues I've already ranted far much.

Ok, lots thoughts, get dead wrong? think I'm missing wife refer times. There’s way that’s China’s actual number... someone please remind country isn’t damn competition see break highest record? oh cares? im tired shit. wear damn mask get life might case soon. US still shit healthcare system overrun hospital means many dead. Winter coming. Dry cold air far effective way airborne illnesses spread.

Remember right wing twitter accounts talking dead H1N1 early days outbreak? Saying 24k dead year reprehensible 1500

But nah lets pretend everything fine.

Like wtf kind comment that. COVID-19 Speedrun % also true. think selfish might realize might potentially harm instead, choose keep kids school. Exactly. two chances stop virus: early control outbreaks prevent widespread community transmission second time national lockdown. point, virus prolific track, trace contain. We’ve elected take herd immunity route, better worse. That’s factually we’re right now. hope vaccine boost population immunity 20-30% probably take one two seasons us reach ~60%+ population immunity point we’ll able control outbreaks virus likely become endemic. 

And it’s said, people tried tiny amount extra effort keep people safe. let’s honest, lot people incapable engaging safe behavior begin simply ignorance incompetence (look many people still don’t know wear mask touch face stand close strangers). usually scramble experts stop disease early stages outbreaks contained— we’re country idiots (who can’t handle disruption 6 months without losing minds apparently). 

Scientists corporations known months, can’t read quarterly earnings report without comment “[business] effects virus likely last well 2021 1H 2022.” Yeah bad dude don’t know getting downvoting. correct. don’t think fact dispute. Yes! must big lead alot people talk said election. dont get people still think political Masks already mandated Indiana, 75% fucking people come Wal-Mart wear correctly, even wear all. Low analytical intelligence + arrogance horrific combination person. Howabout risk wear mask healthy people move lives?

This overhyped flu. Sucks risk group rest us aren't. 

Survival fittest time now. Adapt die.

I'm wearing mask. Watch recent debate asking “who would trust believe anything guy says?” you’ll answer. Pretty sure inferred someone, contagious, get use delivery service/store pick interaction associate buyer (for instance Walmart pick up) It’s medicine. medical field concerned health individual. don’t speak health society economics it.

If would require literally trillions dollars save 1 life, “medical world” doesn’t speak that. Public health officials economists would. They’d ask question “what else money would help people?”

It’s scientists say. obvious since day 1. impressive ride I’ve on. There’s rides immerse much ROTR does, I’m always impressed Imagineering team ride. dark ride impresses level Harry Potter Forbidden Journey. Someday hope get understand wrong without expense close ones lives. seems indicate receive dose sometime age 19, two doses fit certain criteria, one traveling internationally. I'm certain never took varicella vaccine adulthood, I'm guessing titer would necessary people two doses adulthood believe immunity may worn off. Yep. like page.

It’s hard enforce laws mandates government police you. literally posted internet people make feel like something. Virtue signaling around parts Reddit getting annoying. can't expense life life family. asked could please stop talking Whatever narratives convenient huh? guy telling covid much higher fatality rate ebola. deadliest illness we've ever faced, there's way anyone could handle trump absolved responsibility.

Now he's *also* pushing trumps bullshit covid deadly big deal. Actually think said rounding turn Ok random redditor internet. going take vaccine Walmart, paused. Yes, Walmart. NONE employees polls voted wore masks. favorite people think virus political hoax going magically go away Presidential election 🤦🏼‍♀️ Live SA. districts open capacity right now. dumb response lol 2nd wave Europe occurred loosening restrictions enforcing them. They're literally talking deaths hospitalizations. God reading comment chain frustrating.  Sounds like good job :P Can't read Black white thinking like you’re demonstrating precisely problem, suspect. Hope last I’m J&amp;J vaccine participant. paused haven’t actually received yet, I’m scared everything went me.

Whats issue here? means work; via statistical large body mathematics; simple treat get better base relationship.

going 15-10 days hospital stays - ICU - means treat something close 28.5% patients time frame locally, beds remain circulation period time. (figuratively, literally.)

Governor's mask mandate coronavirus mandates recently tossed MI Supreme court (GOP legislature sued won-hooray! smdh) immediately reissued state health department along Governor's orders, different form. 99% people wear masks grocery store work still dodge non-wearers breakroom/offices sometimes sales floor. I'll take lunch breaks outside car think safer; never breakroom. Oh yes, let’s kill hundreds thousands people poor sob get job back. thanks. Go beg charity.

From four days ago:

[NPR: Studies Point Big Drop COVID-19 Death getting better, worse. Glad hear improved! awful them! Remember good ole days ment condom? masks work last year? 

When many died seasonal flu. Nobody noticed flu disapeared since March...? tired winning yet? South LA here. Tons maskers. Homeless tweakers dont wear (maybe 15%) theres tons assholes dont. Especially ""face tattoo gangsters"" mentioned think theyre hard scared virus. annoying fuck. seem like two different scenarios. reasonable group ""friends dinner"" ""frat party"" together me. Pod up, evaluate risks, wear masks. Thank that. might saved someone’s life! people don’t want pay negligent behavior

And is-the part aren’t supposed say loud. Opposing abortion it’s punishing women sex shit people grandstand about. Congress technically ability change election date, although little political that. need constitutional amendment change day inauguration though that's something would reasonably happen. Last checked vaccine cure stupidity yet. Honestly, suspect sizeable portion anti-lockdown protests Spring motivated fact actually spending time family making miserable. Fucking kill stop poisoning society stupidity cops know don’t think it’s real. hoax. :/ Hahahaha never even lockdown... March May doesn’t even count economy still screwed. wait gonna keep economy open virus gonna worse ever start attacking know really bad !remindme 10 days ""please true, please true"" there’s large population religious fanatics? trump wins popular vote lose USA always killed (and died) freedoms. country born war. violent country. constantly war conflict *someone*. Even ourselves. remember reading article years back USA peace like 20 years total since birth. Except proven happens.

Several places instituted right light cameras shortened length yellow light catch speeders, caused collisions well. Guess controls lights?

DOT works police time. refreshingly naïve think they're going adversarial police. People given up, even democratic strongholds like Dallas Houston massive increases infections hospitalizations Well done election coming up. worry guys ""were rounding corner!"" Yay Yes lifelong goal ! Everyone scared wearing masks. dream since wee little sheepy. 🙄 idiot. don’t even need scientific study tell this. biggest promoter HCQ got COVID didn’t take part medication, know it’s fake. I'm arguing measures stop spread lol. I'm arguing measures adjusted real infection numbers. go lockdown unless absolutely necessary. true infection rates fraction March/April lock down. That's lose legitimacy put certain classes people back line medical treatment. Alcoholics go back line kidney transplants. Smokers go back line lung transplants. ventilators limited went young/healthy instead old/obsess. medical system doesn’t waste scarce resources don’t put good use. iirc couple countries got husband almost die sudden kidney failure whole thing too. 2020 hell year (hes lot better now) northern St Johns County huge Trump rally front Baptist church morning...no masks social distancing. Meanwhile neighbor doctor looks done back back tours Iraq. close letting guard crossed paths grocery store Wednesday appearance utter exhaustion voice snapped back reality. know think surge tied schools

In retrospect, countries done outdoor school summer. also donates millions dollars Wuhan's laboratory

1. donate personally, grant provided US government
2. millions, 600,000
3. ""laboratory"", Wuhan Institute also told us masks 3 months pandemic goes scientific standards ever!.

Here's said reason walking around mask,” though adds he’s “against masks,” worried health care providers sick people “needing them,” says masks lead “unintended consequences” people touching face fiddle mask.*

This march! it, a) shortage masks health workers b) time experts entirely sure whether masks would enough. later found virus spread via air, point man 30 years failed us mattered most. hold says much trust earned it.

One could say exact thing Trump would actually truth. Yet seem quarrel him. wonder is?!

When read comments like one somewhat understand people call morons cultists.

P.S. going waste time comment. quite literally brainwashed. Let's hope wake eventually anything regret.   lie effectiveness masks? Maybe didnt spread beginning given ammunition conspiracy theorists. What’s “mandating” mean here? I’m native speaker based Way many don't, sure. teeny, tiny masks half size standard surgical mask drive nuts. see enormous gaps around tiny masks. Seriously, people payed extra money mask that's less effective. WTF??? beginning milder people even bother getting tested see allergies, cold, flu, covid? Fine hell anyone wear mask. Hillary 3 million + votes POSOTUS. 


No, tRump win poplular vote, electoral college 'won' election him. Evolution care personal beliefs.

You're choosing add God reason. designed God?

The problem is: Let's say God created everything universe design complexity.

Then designed created God? complexity simply ""Exist""

Big Bang says nothing comes bang energy level atoms ever increasing evolution universe formed result billions years. 

In scenario, nothing came complex divine capable causing big bang. 

But how? explain evolution physical process complexity came big bang evidence. 

But suddenly ""God?"" point come existence. happen? create himself? happen exist? 

It's simply logic gap. One choosing make reasons still solve problem creation.  Ah yes, staying home losing job access groceries. Something majority Americans able 🙄 

If ready adult conversation this, go back kid's table. We're talking something serious here. finding different ways say ""I care people. understand nuance people's situations family."" know already. getting old hearing it. Remember Fauci said masks don’t help? Also said shouldn’t change daily lives?

Pepridge Farm remembers. Yeah ok religious sheep question blindly following comes empathy others? Nah. Can't bothered.

-The people live El Paso getting hit hard particular? less hospital space? comparing detected detected cases far March April.

Ok fast

Not really. Hardly comparable March/April. seen thing live. enforcement argument bs. Hardly laws actively enforced vast majority people follow whatever laws place given community. know definitely feel like pandemic end things calm bit distant future. next months going awful however, prepare mentally make sure house stocked, especially cases rising area. love got downvoted speaking scientific, logical manner.

Shows “science lovers” bowing altar Dr. Fauci actually science-denying idiots.

Daily cases means nothing! media cover percentage deaths relation new cases? number cases per much testing done?

Hint: numbers wouldn’t fit narrative terrified COVID.

Losers. enormous mistake made pandemic (in countries, US) decision put customers employees one side businesses forcing everyone make choice normal life lockdown earning living vs. lockdown. alternatives. Sometimes pay business stay closed while. Sometimes pay people stay home. creative forget way things always done, little long takes. Communities situations like need make sure everyone shares sacrifices need made everyone's sake determine target sacrifices intelligently blunt instrument. way communities get done, unfortunately anyone want accept reality, government. see starkly contrast outcomes societies sense community exists- Asia, doesn't- mostly European American countries. pandemic preview lot similar crises going play nothing less natural selection action. ""Natural selection"" pretty sterile term belies meaning: lots lots people dying, way life dying along them. acute till least mid 2022 know, could 80% exposed asymptomatic one summer 24% though. 67% might towns. Can’t embrace population control collectively ok death rate surpassing birth rate? [World Population global population approaching 7.7B people. shouldn’t kids

Lacking empathy unbecoming you. 

A lot people rely school system education. It’s support system many. Particularly lower income families. fuck them, right? Yeah phrase “Herd immunity never accomplished without vaccine” crazy. people realize vaccines weren’t common 1940s?

But phrase herd immunity equally politicized masks good job. true mandatory vaccination law people already prone illnesses

Last checked chance dying really low unless preexisting conditions reinfected measles: impossible us herd immunity virus

This would mean pandemic would never-ending. Herd immunity goal vaccine. Oh, per capita, plenty European countries us beat. France hitting 40,000 day like US hitting 200,000. Yes! regional dialect! Wait thought weren’t even done first y’all saying third? Death rate much lower 1 percent point. Closer .5 less. think entire country there, parts country will....and 500,000 dead. fuck wrong people Short sighted narrow minded. also tend stay home moms, it’s like closing schools would disrupt work achedule like TSA: give goal let’s rip bandaid go full Sweden. tell flu vaccine reduces flu infection seriousness [by 50% far 50% deadlier (or even 100% deadlier).

Please stop spreading misinformation. probably even higher 1 4... imagine quite people (like first responders essential staff) routinely tested even healthy. call hamburgers steamed hams? Pandemic fatigue already setting job. went 1 day office (being allowed leave 11am-noon), 2 days office, 2 days office full 9 hours, starting next week it’ll 3 days office full 9 hours. 

I live nyc. take 3 trains work, 3 trains home. Thats 18 packed trains rush hour. pandemic. 

I dont make enough money fund two $60 ubers every day go work. wont give us hazard pay. simply dont care. Nobody office wears masks practices social distancing, despite majority office 60+ years old. Maskless people trains cough sneeze without covering mouths. 

It’s gonna hit us hard. I’m immunocompromised theres nothing protect myself, family. It’s terrifying. happens car unregistered, essentially part registration fee paying able park street. I’m assuming lining help unwanted children. 

Also, give shit someone else life? seriously don’t problems worry about? interesting see abnormalities detected MRI exercise capacity patients strongly correlated serum markers inflammation. suggests potential link chronic inflammation ongoing organ damage among survivors.

Chronic inflammation treatable pretty efficiently modern drugs. I'm making statement long term sustainability damage inflammation associated covid neither paper. data. Hear out.

The biggest issue anti-maskers, cloth-maskers. isn’t peer-reviewed evidence cloth masks work. contrary, many peer-reviewed studies show cloth masks ineffective lot cases increase infection risks. fabric store nice little viral payloads get transferred around direct contact, actually increase time virus hangs around air splitting larger droplets smaller ones.

Hospitals know this, allow doors cloth mask. That’s make trade proper surgical mask entering.

Now look population. Less 1% people refuse wear masks. hand, 80-90% wearing cloth-masks. really wanted make significant impact public health, would educate people dangers cloth masks. submission removed because

Hospitals nearly maximum capacity. health district rescinded mask mandate. fucking hate idaho states getting hit hard never even hit first wave.

The states hit hard summer never even hit first wave. way late.

it's not. behavior change always starts slowly, often almost imperceptibly. there's reason old expression lifecycle breakthru ideas ""crazy, crazy, crazy, obvious"". Every bit early change helps. may make fall/winter LOT less horrible might wind being, different, good way, none. Dude look Google latest news vaccine development. vaccine trials going well, looks easy virus develop vaccines for. Pfizer almost certainly get approval December January. there’s Oxford vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson, likely distributed around spring too. There’s precise end date anyone give, it’s unlikely COVID big threat fall 2021 still avoid family gatherings classes online. Sorta, ya.

This virus. going away.

Look news articles experts telling us 'it's going till 2022'.... whole year masks, social distancing, concerts, large events, lockdowns requests see family loved ones.

They started 2 weeks. 2 months. 2 years. going away. managing fear general population. can't come last March tell everyone ever going away. ease everyone it. Interesting stuff, thanks info reference:

Also, fatality rate got lower part learned treat serious cases better part we're lot shield vulnerable populations. Months ago devastated care homes, today mostly infecting younger people.

We also still contend risk overwhelming hospitals larger percentage people die result. Flattening curve remains necessity, especially we're seeing exponential infections places.

Good news is, really, really self-segregation, damage people outside community less type nutters went sturgis year, example. Gotta take left.  F chat man's ass That's trying make fun. think masks effective (not 100% well worth wearing). I'm making fun people want talk shit potentially dangerous also saying BLM protests cause spread hurt anyone. ridiculous hypocritical. arent, live hong kong, im oart team needs track verify cases. numbers actually true enough.

it also It’s message echoed media outlets prominent public health experts America, like former Centers Disease Control Prevention director Tom Frieden, loudly warned efforts rush reopening supportive mass protests. claim: don’t address racial inequality, it’ll much harder fight Covid-19. There’s also evidence virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially people wear masks.

and said said racism another public health emergency, least protestors wearing masks.

the link posted confirms said accurate. works case numbers low hospitals overwhelmed. helps keep cases low despite normal societal behaviour.

Moderator: “Is guarantee?”

Trump: “...no it’ll soon” Breaks heart every day hear pleading people care others. know it; must feel powerless. Same. One colleagues told March believe going working home flu. told actually quite different flu could result potentially millions US deaths taken seriously told ridiculous would deaths typically flu. 

We're 4 times deaths high end flu deaths year still hitting highs daily cases Oh hey, remember you. guy making fun Biden's stutter. great dude. testing. testing means cases. pregnancies. pregnancies testing. test pregnancies. stating right now. Speculating future futile. Aussie here. Here's things played personally. 

Early March, business usual. Friday 13th March, team got sent home office told work home indefinitely. following Monday, team got provided anything requested able work. Keyboards, mice, monitors - whatever people available supplied. 

From tax perspective (our tax returns usually submitted July), everyone got claim flat 80c per hour working home cover additional expenses. 

Most people know line work sent home, today, still plans return office. Yes, understand I'm lucky still able job. way look it, outside able stay indoors. 

Outside work, still wear mask everywhere go, though I'm definitely seeing less less extent makes sense 5 new cases last 24 hours state. 

Yes lockdowns suck, yes people impacted financially. government needs providing citizens, done extent could certainly better. end day, suffered early lockdown things get bad. everything I've read past 7 months US, y'all much larger proportion idiots ruined strategy viable. work retail store. fuckers..... customers coming American flag scarves around necks, old Karen’s furious don’t want unmasked infront register... need money fucking live. live w someone nearly died covid. don’t need this. can’t handle greed brainlessness. worst part I’m allowed deny service them. Plus it’s state. Fuck. got silicone mask brackets help lot this. try remove masks ND? That's really odd... I've wearing one around ND since April never told remove it, harassed, anyone try remove it. You’re right. definitely delay inevitable more. mother lives Indiana (I raised live anymore thank god). currently hospitalized pneumonia lungs (not covid) calls yesterday ""accidentally"" placed covid floor. WTF. hoping everything contract put kept hours finally moved her. terrifying. d614g variant still dominant one, unchanged spring. I'm sure half white house gets sick every year never wear masks that. covid different? Terrible take, get vaccine go back normal. incorrect. know percentage protests coincided curfews, Princeton University study found 93% BLM protests peaceful.

receipts: studies concluded mask-wearing outside reasons protests cause outbreaks. study ever credibly claimed things saying. table says around 1.1-1.3% increase deaths/1000 every year 2014 year. getting 0.05%? Based current situation. IFR spring somewhere 0.75% 1.5%. 

But find whole-Europe daily deaths? data could get pretty good estimate. That’s completely irrelevant. think billionaire works harder fire fighter? think “skills” much valuable society policeman’s? top tier 90% paid interstate highway system. system necessary billionaires make money now. pay 35% nominally much much less tax breaks. lucky knew capitalize that. don’t deserve keep 90% winnings bribe lawmakers reducing taxes. No, definitely second wave. Honestly read several times realized *weren't* saying, Anyone remember 83,000 total amount population worldwide? 

I like wow guy really means wayyyy back day! people school got actually


All school alert students sat around person


Acting like student touch every door Man, hearing true everywhere got idiots compassion. least collectively got shit together country, good luck way know someone it? Husband also super sick around January, antibody test May came back negative.  possibility reinfection certain, likeliness unknown. much unknown take chances. Possibly reinfection mutated strain, different initial infection? early know. Coupled possible mutated strain found Norway concerned We’re going back “normal” vaccine. That’s reality. Anti-maskers selfish idiots, aren’t singlehandedly keeping us magically eradicating pandemic month. agree. example town new case spread traced house parties. holidays basically crapton house parties. trouble think landed literal hospital bed? 

That depressing. Young people genuinely affected it. Remember whole “Oh sending kids school result many kids dying” 

How’d turn out? Thats Wuhan one day?? guys people saying hoax, fascist government overreach, masks kill CO2, etc? feel like enough people US believing nonsense never chance; people got lockdown fatigue, strange theories pseudoscience gaining popularity rationalize ending it. Interestingly, friends Argentina believe variety things; hydroxychloroquine, November, virus Chinese laboratory, etc. find worldwide nature theories... don’t know, curious. Alternative strategy: massively ramp production instant/easy tests. Distribute schools, businesses, households. Approach production like going war. lot unknowns, continue over. CDC gives sources scenario estimates read see differences. names, clear different sources looked different parameters (age, country, month, etc.) explains least difference. currently feel like wading papers maybe weekend.

I believe CDC link talking  looking something makes u feel worse wont help u either.   got asteroid stat. I’d say Nat Geo pretty reputable. stat dying asteroid hitting you. Maybe there’s difference deaths strikes gotta think there’s small difference lol yes, exactly correct. multiple studies found BLM protests drove spikes cases. studies grandparent post referring 'a agenda-driven psuedoscience ""studies"" clearly pre-written'. however, evidence pre-written; evidence agenda driving them; credible challenge ever raised could justify going anywhere near far calling studies ""psuedoscience."" Stop. It’s good thing President United States personal attorney Rudy Giuliani earlier month. /s hopeful 10 days ago. went right back up. need regional lockdowns Spain. reason everyone focuses Madrid. moment it’s region numbers dropping. Davis county report about? Admin school board don’t care. given parents making noise. Priority goes like davis schools: parents protest masks threaten sue refuse test kids, sports extracurricular activities continuing costs, education, student safety, teacher safety. priority all: High risk teachers, students, members community. talking initial cult case generally? initial cult superspreader caught Korea badly flatfooted took track cultists, especially since lot started hiding. Since Korea done much much better. even publish numbers various people linked known outbreak know got infected long time mystery cases.

And tracing keeping virus is? Koreans wear masks lot countries social distancing quite weak since middle March it. swear people would rather hide bunker rest lives. 

People skeptical good news would mass-upvote anything suggests we'll die 10 minutes. answered me. parts data presented video call disinformation? really curious understand basing perception. next great pandemic 2122 history holds. 27 states 1000 cases today, aren’t done. Well think mandate much teacher throw idea one teacher teaching math one grade level others creating content one one stuff. Great idea, everyone play potential strengths, dont think realized remote would truly work well, could alter education forever. understand simple problem even approach, multiple types learners, different home lives, technology availability, self starter ethic. interesting think possibilities say online even broadcast lessons available constantly across state. Got tested today, line pretty long, moving quite fast. took like 1 hour, testing waiting included. Staff friendly people disciplined.

Let's hope whole thing right choice.  50s 99.98%

There's 276,000,000 Americans 50.

So downplaying 5.5 million people dying needless deaths why? 20 die 

and doubles every week happy. seen mask weeks. basic public health measures pandemic literal orwellian totalitarian fascist islamo-communism I'm you, Internet stranger. 

I'd prefer taser though. :) hope, far I'm going little greedy leave country soon get degree good job abroad, financial situation stable worry country. lot friends want see 20-30s stained fighting think loosing battle death mandatory seems confirm German scientists found back June. good know children's futures need compromised.  I'm little tired cry wolf. heard ""on brink"" ""breaking point"" months now. they? Agree one hundered percent! Indoor dining still risky guidelines still assume Covid spread aerosols.

Blind leading blind didn’t impact family wouldn’t care much assholes destroying futures many. ashamed themselves. Stupid, selfish people continue stupid selfish, mandate not. Mask compliance honestly pretty good around county still red. countries similar mask compliance also seeing spikes again. think point need hope one myriad vaccines development works well distributed coming months. yes continue due diligence safety measures hopes lie companies developing vaccine really governemnt. Please make sure something hate = voting asshat out. I’m American someone neighbouring country, president’s stain North American 4 years long. 400,000 February would realistic worst case scenario. Projections like annoy me. deniers look back “only” 300-325k say grand overreaction.  potential lack immunity Covid-19 nothing different strains, case flu. consider 'COVID death' - looks like COVID death, COVID death Belgium regardless positive test.

You can’t see Covid it’s irrelevant.

(Is seems like) Damn cares? winter going something else. [COVID-19 far deadlier immunity good, get via vaccination (doesn't kill people), let something spread without anything stop (kills lots people).

Please spread misinformation. available depends lot things. approval point maybe gonna month later there's multiple vaccines spread time. enough doses cover nurses seniors whoever something else, timeline depends manufacturing, shipment storage plus minus various amounts time guess. wide scale distribution another set variables. talking simply approval date others talking anyone walk walgreens get shot.

These anti-mask tards desperate ruled. crave authority. crave conformity. ""freedom"" rhetoric nonsense. know freedom is.

Some tards would still refuse wear masks. OK numbers would adequately small. seems like losers whining ""liberty"" ones want use actively harm others? maybe chose use freedom responsibly (and encourage one another same!) worry losing it.

USE BRAIN PLEASE. Many, many months. Yet somehow people still hung this. correct. learnt another fellow redittor.  


They add confirmed corona positive well suspected corona, i.e. believe covid-19 accelerated death count covid death.  worries, plenty science denying politicians mocking Fauci this. Meanwhile, every single one knows access experimental treatments Americans never able get. time apprehensive 

Then don’t dude. yeah next october.... I'm sharing anecdote life thread topic. Many people replied going thing, sometimes helps know alone. Getting advice feedback others part makes ""these parts Reddit"" great sometimes.

We're finding coming shitty situation often person support structure robust we'd like need. bother internet strangers talk one another concerns? 100% right, sheep don’t like hear that. want everyone fear constantly mask forever. Rounding turn turning back towards case spikes. New Zealand cases. social distancing rules, wear masks, 40,000+ arenas filled rugby.

Their administration made clear contagious was, hunkered down, wore masks, leaders mock politicize wearing masks, nobody believed hoax, ignore science.  snuffed moved on.  cried like little bitches. American idiot someone explain things getting bad Czech fine Europe struggling earlier year? absolutely not. fascists love saying democrats think ""everyone like fascist?"" bub. like Mitt Romney, he's fascist. like John McCain, think he's fascist either. Trump hand *is* actual, born bred fascist. support trump, default makes one too. **It's hard understand** word fetus really help feel better doing? Fine, stop sucking fetuses vacuum.

I claim bible scientifically accurate, that's me.

I going say wrong right left down.

We free believe want. eating public, think removing mask bites make much difference. 

All restaurants could shut like suggested.... that's much tougher choice. aren’t talking symptoms, mri scan organ damage. news increased cases feels like start March Yes Easter  voted yesterday half people processed votes wore masks..and even though signs saying wear masks vote..half people voting didn’t wear masks. one said anything. Hamilton county Georgia. I'm guessing son school-age. That's crazy. Republicans saying left right kids immune spread it. People really dumb. Can't wait Black Plague Friday! non American, joke made absolutely sense me. Well remember confirmed cases. believe many, many days fewer 100k cases reported yet 150k~ actually contracted disease. definitely get 60F = 15C aint gonna work. ~now warmer that. Asymptomatic bad sick end hospital. 

Treatment became better. Shut fuck wear mask. Yeah I’m pro mask it’s actually scary many people mandating them. Reddit lol hive mind disconnected. Trump it, he's """" immune """" now, good, pandemic Lol k  much densely populated Sweden. difficult comparison. realize coronaviruses mutatation rate several order magnitude slower seasonal influenza, right? mutations found would bypass vaccine target spike protein.

To flat believe wont work beyond dumb. already reviewing data sounds promising. early phases certainly were. see least 1 2 rolled emergency use end yearish. Chances leaning towards approval dont forget doesnt need 100 % effective approval 

I wont get either see shitload efficacy data. even I'm young risk, weigh options. People think vaccines risk free havent bothered look them. brainer risk groups. disproportionate IFR staggering. 0.01% chance dying age vs 4%+ risk groups. elderly risk vaccinated thing kill far less people mandating! rate, go 500,000$ lot people know that, unfortunately. know bad adverse effects years road.

They may nothing. may something. let's use jump conclusions map figure out. Good you. possible they've changed guidelines past month. also possible getting test travel regulations, different ""I want kill mom - get tested, please?"" It’s presence virus that’s problem. people exists, opportunities disease. 2020, leaders saying something effect of, “We understand spread viruses. built society backs hundreds years cooperation. Wear mask, consequences. don’t follow protocol infections get past X number, institute lockdown involves following...”

Legit would glad change mind... think integrity destroyed. think mistake. sure would lie something else? fudge vaccine results ""because better good""?

I agree people change minds, Fauci specifically gave wrong information.  find okay official lies public? still blows away months pandemic masks somehow still somewhat partisan issue. Wear mask people, it’s difficult! women wanting sex much nothing would get done. would still living stone age. No, women men sexual drive. even universe right gladly die hill. man disagrees liar trust him. sex street like 2 stray dogs? I'll tell why, women want to. wrong, least learned something  Yup. Even back March town full lockdown local police said “we can’t anything enforce public park closures” it’s like, police car siren megaphone? tell people “please disperse immediately, park closed via city ordinance”

But really enjoyed anything. joke town going Starbucks faster calling 9-11 need find cop isn’t busy. Maybe? Still? fact consider prison says lot you.

You're clearly going keep playing game, that's guys do, I'm out. reference bigger picture. people trust leaders. leaders instill lockdown protect people people revolt. yet people power actually change leadership. protests across globe, yet nothing changes.

(Or rules made good way - like fining shops customer mask on.) Why?



Everyone saying Trump's fault countries lauded earlier Europe way way past America per capita infections.



People want comparisons stop tie politics. internally general regarding West's attitudes this. Cases aren’t problematic aren’t causing proportional increase hospitalizations deaths. aren’t, clear. Hospitalizations decreasing, actually.

We shouldn’t use indicator judge pandemics severity, implies current situation worse one spring/summer.

Healthcare first line responders get first. saw report young healthy people might looking 2022 get it. wave people refuse get it. Sure help, eventually , maybe*, wearing mask socially distanting, better socially isolating, increasing chances getting vaccine. puts lots people risk.

*There several people thinking virus could mutate, reducing effectiveness vaccine might endemic, like Flu. Thank you, that's discouraging see. Fortunately Australia entering Summer things look less lucky Northen Hemisphere. Brilliant! flu gets full swing gonna deaths cases.   Complete indifference. astounding me. went knowing person thinking pretty braindead inconsiderate. remember global death toll reached 100 CNN. need Twitter that. thread plenty them. Definitely. Test results take 5 days get back tests done locally (PA)... really numbers reported today likely positives 4-7 days ago. mean get point, people trust. might rare.I think many people least trust members family, significant other, best friend, kind thing. think statement bit cliche.

If someone says ""I think people misunderestimate me"", know means still sounds stupid. Third wave? Ain’t still first? It’s like damn mountains Interstellar. Friend, masks work people collectively wear properly. 

- disease spread respiratory droplets emitted mouth nose.

- droplets make way environment around you, transferred others contract disease.

- However, people collectively wear masks properly, significant portion contaminated droplets trapped within infected person's mask, therefore, droplets *don't* make way public environments. significant portion droplets make way public environments collective proper wearing masks produces significant statistical reduction case transmission. power federal funding.

You're usually hospital pretty desperate shape. kind shape ten days instead fifteen actually pretty huge.

England currently three-tier system, Wales Northern Ireland opted short, national “circuit-breaker” lockdowns.
“We don’t take one-size-fits-all approach warranted,” Sturgeon said news conference.
“We envisage returning situation severe first lockdown,” said.
Sturgeon put proposal vote Scottish parliament next week.
Once approved, Scottish government decide regions go levels, restrictions coming force Nov. 2.
Level 0 “the closest normality safely get without effective treatments COVID vaccine COVID,” said.
In level, coronavirus “very suppressed still threat.” Eight people three different households meet indoors, businesses largely allowed open long COVID-19 safety measures place.
Level 1 see “reasonable degree normality,” situation cases rising prevalence “still fairly low.”
Six people two different households allowed meet indoors.
Level 2 transmission higher rising. Gatherings inside people’s homes banned, restrictions hospitality businesses come effect.
Level 3 hospitality businesses closed, restaurants still allowed remain partially open.
Level 4 highest level, National Health Service risks overwhelmed.
Non-essential shops shut, six people two different households still allowed meet, outdoors. Scottish government strive keep manufacturing construction open.

IFR(infection fatality rate): deaths divided estimated infections

It’s estimate fatality rate virus. IFR estimated scientific studies attempt account unconfirmed cases, since everyone gets tested. 

Personally think number greatly influence global virus response. 5% IFR vs .5% IFR requires different response Even could shutdowns (which, competent federal government, could probably manage) bigger issue huge percentage Americans care. much political issue cultural one. Coronavirus breathtaking. tested positive days ago. loss smell, symptom. think Covid, wishful thinking part perhaps. admit though, couple days, could shake feeling something wrong me. like brain trying send message, listen.

Could share article read stated EUA would March-April please? Instead working together end pandemic, people working together prolong it. Selfishness disguised individualism. Belgium counts deaths differently.  Got it. think complete lockdown 2 weeks away. people could base abortion rights facts fetus rather absolutism religious beliefs personal liberty. Lmfao Times getting downvotes incredibly stupid post need sort clarification. heard first folks, influenza mutate, novel strain every year! Haha, also following trope. see.

Alternatively, would also accepted, sarcastically saying:

""You must really fun parties."" 

Lastly, may unoriginal some, still 100% factual relevant. worth repeating. Since lamo's like you, take away deflect focus pandemics still full swing, currently, getting worse. Correct. change much rile ""muh freedom""-folks. camera accurate radar/laser detector irrefutable. 

And police set would NEVER fudge revenue! Anything reduces spread save American lives. 

Do think impact politicization mask usage? Forgive ignorant question- mask mandate really apply cannot reasonably socially distance another person, whenever inside (i.e. grocery store, pharmacy, etc)? Would mask mandate mean wear one whenever house, even going walk outside one's around? constitutional. get people understand that. Actually there’s shortage flu vaccine doses Iceland. I’ve appointment cancelled twice already last weeks flu vaccine haven’t got enough. imagine COVID vaccine challenge get enough well even Iceland. sure! saying healthy people careful three months calling ""long term""? Yes, people lingering symptoms months more, fatigue symptoms EBV half year. cant extrapolate amount time virus circulation. sub Canadian here. cops give shit. Whatever country in, simple. Many simply care. know I've asked cops, 90% attitude ""better things"" do. Unless department gets profit fines, nothing. mental problem prevents understanding hyperbole cunt ? 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! end spectrum board anygood either, believes, care anymore. 

Walt Kirby -- “I personally care whether anybody wears mask not. want dumb enough walk around expose others, that's fine me,” Kirby said. “Nobody's wearing damned mask anyway. ... I'm sitting back watching catch die. Hopefully I'll live it.” Jesus, seem like insufferable asshole. librarian school wears face shield difficulty breathing mask. came room tell something mask off. walking put like ""oh care need wear it. wear administration anal it"". Like um can't breathe mask really going able breathe catch covid?? ""feel"" much want. make true. designer. natural selection. load crap. cop ever concerned whether they're stressing civilian? current doctrine actually preferred order induce compliance. escalate cause subject make wrong move use force gain control. Cop escalates--They comply-- something authorizes use force. Problem solved. Dining worth rural county live relatively cases. 2 months ago, almost nobody wore mask. I'm sure changed, probably slow steady rise cases. rate increase peaked July dropping. checked statistics county again, rate cases started climbing oct 15, half way July peak numbers already. rising really fast. 

As much we've warned second wave coming, seeing surge charted visually frightening. thank Gwyneth Paltrow pseudo-science team GOOP putting stuff like mainstream. talking about?

I truly appreciate convo man thank stay strong ❤️ fuck off. Unfortunately masks solve stupid. I'm sure mask usage would increase bit, here's example mean. 

My son's soccer game postponed today, due fact parent team tested positive Covid. Now, person got tested Covid sometime week proceeded bring child soccer practice Thursday getting results back. knew slight, maybe even tiny, chance Covid proceeded put everyone else risk regardless. lots precautions practice games (masks required league games even sidelines away parents), individual came practice, parents pretty much stay away proceeded also interact folks there. dumb irresponsible masks solve it. Odds are, one got them, world would person risk it? Covid go away, going take lot longer thanks people like this. Horrifying numbers, especially thinking close coldest months. 

Stay strong, Belgian friends. Wishing best luck health. also constitutional. Nothing wrong"
