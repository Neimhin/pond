That‚Äôs basically false cold flu could get well. Yes! exactly need see happening. sounds like long enough time, would likely longer reality. 

10 days symptom onset recommended Isolation period anyone tested positive symptoms Covid-19.  Anyone within 6 ft 15 minutes someone Quarantine 10 days since last contact. People Quarantine alone, infected, pass on. People breathing space like house, condo, tent, rv, etc... infected individual considered Constant Contact person, Covid spreads air. 

So, 1 person tests positive multi day event, sudden 10 day Isolation symptoms resolve medication last 24 hours. big Quarantine Isolation area? needs bigger. 

This trying ~avoid~ Covid-19. imagine entire festival intentionally trying spread amongst one another. guess scenario would somewhere between. would take months either way. People keep harping this, much changing investing money vaccination sites, large local focused. Appreciate background information that! fact, keeping mandatory mask mandates long creates perfect ammunition Trump 2.0 campaign. know swing lot votes favor?

I'm event industry Colorado they're ramping program get rapid tests venues planners thousands week. conference call Friday it. Wisconsin Center blocks away giving shots 28th IIRC. know use Pfizer. I‚Äôm going get voted, wondered definition ‚Äúsurge‚Äù become skewed. India seeing surge, Oregon not. white okay I'm surprised especially friend visited family December said totally fine. 1918 flu came back mutated deadline months later. wish states would adopt WV incentive plan. Texas still using 95% allotment, anyone still fence needs incentive push over. Sikhs need approval, white man ü§öüèæ think that‚Äôs perfectly fine people another country want that. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm definitely okay international travel way. I‚Äôd hope eventually many worldwide vaccinated won‚Äôt necessary though see phase things it‚Äôs needed. really draw line example, inside USA concert put private business don‚Äôt like idea it. California still going strong. Anyone thinks vaccine passport good thing asking country go full blown China level regime. Huge violation freedom, one abuse covid vaccine. There's way ever allowed. First ‚Äúexposed‚Äù sure infected. day saw it‚Äôs unlikely would even enough incubation time infect someone else. also wore masks time. also effectively fully vaccinated. non-risk. don‚Äôt need test quarantine unless get symptoms. Yes, responding last statement person saying Covid causes issue frequently. stats cases hospitalizations young people? understand.

Here Singapore, healthcare workers range vaccinations COMPULSORY (Hep B, Flu, TDAP, Varicella - chicken pox before) depending job scope. also mandatory childhood vaccinations (MMR, Polio) anyone overseas shots get starting work.

Don't guys US? yes, can't add covid vaccine list? basically mandatory work hospital/clinic. Yeah, people may happy know good everyone long run.

So going refuse (in words) ""innocent vaccine"" future slim chance forced something else sinister? stand ground innocent vaccine could help others sinister demand actually made.

There balance freedom/rights mandatory requirements/laws benefit everyone around you. Imagine someone protesting use seatbelts drink driving. freedom get drunk drive? mean probably deal consequences. wonder many J&amp;J?  Except one time. article:

Polis noted major task addressing ‚Äúhesitance laziness‚Äù didn‚Äôt want endure digital rush appointments. Research shows many waited get vaccinated feel done rational reasons. Maybe don‚Äôt want lose time work bad reaction, they‚Äôve experienced discrimination seeking medical care previously.

A relaxed approach fine vaccine demand greater supply, Polis said. vaccines available everyone, supply matching exceeding demand vulnerable populations gotten vaccinated. law signed earlier year also covered employees paid time authorized using paid sick leave get vaccine recover side effects.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôll get future, maybe month, maybe two months, maybe indefinite date,‚Äù Polis said. ‚ÄúWell, time now. Step get it.‚Äù lost part vision due chicken pox part hearing due swine flu. People act like viruses can‚Äôt lasting damage kids can. Great job! I‚Äôm one week past second dose, almost adults bubble vaccinated SD. Ty exposed, infected. Plus, pretty good immunity 2 weeks first shot. fine. Weird, sorry dog walkers crowding you. masking walking outside (at least passing) until, well, today, dog walker gave extra space anything know people want dog sniffing go by. everyone, masked not, gives ton space passing however. I'd weirded people walked straight 2019 well, lol. Ah yes, I'm sure morally superior thousands people apparently met go Burning Man. 

I've never Burning Man desire to, mean weird douche it. weird wouldve thought bump ages eligibility would've lasted longer. Makes wonder everyone wanted vaccine jumped queue claiming risk condition get earlier. 

Either way though, painful see things dropping soon. either need limit vaccinated people, follow social distancing restrictions, community spread negligible level. complicated. post COVID vaccines COVID subreddit. say decided volunteering? I‚Äôm genuinely curious anyone would want participate sounds like really hard problem. everyone wants vaccinated been, need let everyone else catch COVID want. even approved vaccination whole population, first criteria yet met. fully reopen means kids catch COVID? we? really done research ""correctly"" answer question. That's cause FL dumb AF. Cases spiked town here, many people also foregoing vaccination still wearing masks. Certain sources paint picture DeSantis wants outsiders see. And? That's fair chunk time see trend happening.  Um, safety children cannot vaccinated big legitimate concern. 

We started flatten curb learned long Covid suddenly getting virus real threat, even though death rate isn‚Äôt high. That‚Äôs take progression, least. Thanks keeping civil. 


And yeah I‚Äôd want everyone get shots don‚Äôt need this. 

Out curiosity what‚Äôs opinion countries requiring shot enter? worth waiting for. Indeed. plenty indoor activities, even desert. Also, Burning Man attracts international crowd world won‚Äôt vaccinated September. I‚Äôm two weeks second pfizer shot, today. However manager texted exposed covid Saturday worked together day tiny room (masked, pulled drink stuff several times) Sunday. 

What supposed now? matter two days short full vaccination? get tested? Quarantine?

I thought vaxxed would make feel better, I‚Äôm still paranoid anxious before. fucking sucks. Welp, looks like I'll first burn 32 lol. big supporter vaccine passports. Let responsible among us return normal let selfish conspiracy theorists ones bear cost, instead putting whole population mercy. USA refer ""shots""?

But understandable dodge actual point. database vaccination records? access records? misconception. one ""contract"" signed parties involved

the UK EU signed final agreement time effectively.

We've kinda made New World low exposure isolation, we're areas bring virus us exposing populations little immunity built up. point, I'm almost ready write consequence people's actions - means communities already decided take chances virus, extra restrictions imposed state go unenforced local law enforcement; restrictions simply give people extra reason dislike governor already. remindme robot thing lol.

States dumping backlogs pretty much since start, noticeable numbers lower. Locally release numbers lot times say deaths occurred within weeks time. Final FDA approval Pfizer Moderna would also help hesitant getting sucked fearmongering articles 'dangers' vaccine.

Airbnb spot state south weeks friends family. blast. many ""what ifs"". far, variant covid able escape vaccines. *IF* ever happens, we'll deal then. likely booster made within couple weeks, start manufacturing rolling immediately. What? absolutely reason think that. It‚Äôs estimated 1/3 Americans infected. PLENTY kids get infected everyone drops precautions many refuse vaccine. wanting evidence, ya Thanks ignoring entire point spread far widespread Canada lack lockdown. Viruses magic - disease well spread continue so.

UK Israel R far less 1, whereas around 1.

Furthermore, takes time vaccine *start* working. Israel data showed 3 weeks post first shot. agree (and Canadian btw). Obviously, direct interest help rest world vaccinate. 

We talking Chicago.

Location doesn‚Äôt make goal herd immunity less important.

Herd immunity goal. sending vaccines parts world also important tandem efforts here. look like enough space moment. Haven‚Äôt private business always ability enforce rule masks, doesn‚Äôt discriminate race, religion, ethnicity etc.? Hotel bathroom exhaust usually always on. Drains trapped.

It happened What? timing countries saw case counts drop. US also seeing results. 

Lockdowns aside, case counts, hospitalizations, deaths started dramatically drop 50% populations first doses. feel guys there. We‚Äôre boat Alberta Kenney Shandro. Canadians deserve better. fairness 300-400k cases India right fraction per capita cases January. main problem healthcare system can't handle even modest surge.

There certainly substantial natural population India point, especially among urban poor. asshole president?  would agree you. still large areas country people follow advice local preacher science. see already single issue voters political scene. least next 2 3 years definitely see pockets country covid continue pop effective cost efficient treatment. areas tend lineup hold areas vaccine know what's selfish? Creating immigration requirements specifically exclude people expensive healthcare problems like Canada does. want sound crass flippant, know gonna come way. needed protect others, got damn vaccine soon could. stop held back vaccine holdouts anti-vaxers? fuck? preventing us going back normal. country (US) require it? give shit one state mandating next state dump unvaccinated tourists mine infect plenty people (esp. kids able vaccinated yet thus vulnerable). I'm sick kid gloves anti-vaxers. Could required past EUA? get can't yet, holy shit. tired held back low-information dickwads. UK Israel far far harsher lockdowns far far longer Canada - late 2020/early 2021. Whereas malls open roughly 4 weeks ago.

It's illogical comparison. Yowza, really suck.  Tam straight lying. family living Britain. They've lifting measures quite awhile now. 

Also, Isreal UK saw dramatic case drops even days without covid deaths hitting 50% population first dose. 

All information via studies, Google it. lying? know difference, though?

The vaccine out. everyone protect cuz choice. 

Now there's choice! I'm wasting time people choose get fucked. earth continue put life hold literally reason to? even first place tbh, since follow guidelines going out, least go outside 110% ease I'm worried getting virus since I'm vaccinated.

As useless question, care fellow man plenty. mean bend backwards protect people actively refuse protect themselves. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. problem anymore. actually super cool, wonder effective compared vaccines. Hope keeps safe healthy Bolsonaro. - Tests: 1,110,340 - Cases: 48,846 - Deaths: 789 - Currently Hospitalized: 38,838 - Currently ICU: 7,802 (+13)
 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: way guarantee everyone Covid free. false negatives well chances getting Covid test event. rapid tests least accurate. Also, becomes common thing, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll start see counterfeit tests people lazy get properly tested positive still want go.

At end day, society determine level risk reasonable. huge concert IMO huge risk density sheer number people. work midtown. homeless never worn masks recently like 50% people wearing masks. reach it. Pretty sure US can‚Äôt. think need specific trials that. Israel good enough case study. They're there's sign growth. There‚Äôs reason think large fraction children remain unexposed. think kids secret island somewhere? example, Florida reported total 5 deaths 15, school activities open year.

There seasonal outbreaks kill significant numbers adults, though, matter what. Yes, also worth noting blood clots related viral vector vaccines (J&amp;J AZ), reported cases myocarditis received mRNA vaccines (we cannot yet say specifically related yet though). cases doing? numbers crashing yet? We'll indoor masks least 2022. claims Slovokians delivered vaccine different promised. reaction Russia demand return shipment.

It starting look like Russia running con game delivering, reeling buyers delivering cheap substitute. I'm like you. Last time got flu shot 7 years ago happened clinic time giving asked wanted one like sure think might time I've ever gotten one.  12+ absolutely going way fall, likelihood within month. Pfizer Moderna already submitted requests expand EUA include 12-15 12-17 year olds respectively. important note cases myocarditis severe enough diagnosed resolve own, incidence may much higher reported. Yeah think conservative holdout areas (evangelical communities specifically) begin emerge areas noticeably baseline. good treating Covid, deaths mostly concentrated ironically ‚Äúprolife‚Äù areas.  actively propagating anti(this)vax narratives type this. believe natural ‚Äúlet run course‚Äù preferable ‚Äúputting poison body‚Äù. 

Being antivaxx past almost theoretical. visible real world consequences.  rural suburban won‚Äôt save you. gather indoors without masks enough unvaccinated folks Covid party starts again.  

This won‚Äôt forever think pattern visible august. Patent protections reason. largest vaccine manufacturer world, Serum Institute India, can't manufacture vaccine lack supply chain it. much capacity sitting idle.

Everyone around world trying spin capacity quickly possible, something happen overnight.

Even cooperating multinational pharmaceutical giants deep experience vaccine production, lead time start new line nine months, even supply chain-dependent. Oregon shutting made lose hope normal 2021. really don‚Äôt think state ever remove restrictions rate. vaccine appointments everywhere, going unused counties. Time start planning vacations states guess. want middle ground certain situations- changed masks. used wear N95 triple cotton masks. 

Now I'm indoors strangers wearing rule-compliant mask (covers mouth nose), comfortable (silk, nose piece, tight.) 

I admit I'm good example- never minded wearing masks unless running. enjoying wearing one running anymore!  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* VAERS reliable source general public accounts getting vaccine, source. necessary maintain safety vaccines.

If saying draws causal links actually there, that's interpreter, data. attack data source one have, attack make wrong conclusions data.

Anyone reading this, remember report adverse effects VAERS. Olympics scheduled July 23 August 8. Japan even scheduled start vaccinating general public enough vaccine cover whole adult population [the end fraction population vaccinated Olympics.

Yet they'll allowing Japan residents attend Olympics, epicenter pandemic Japan, renewed state emergency 4th wave virus, known variants, tearing it. that's lived Spain, hours bars too. NYC stops pretty dead cold 4 unless show/party Yes.  Texas .5% lower Louisiana Florida 2% higher

Louisiana 25.92% fully vaccinated think states currently high rates covid (the northeast, Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado) pretty well vaxxed Memorial Day longer elevated levels covid. surprise small surge takes southern states end next month.

In restrictive states think we'll see indoor masking summer feeling outdoor masking going start declining rather rapidly. 4th July think even restrictive states going hard time convincing citizens many (or any) restrictions need kept place (minus indoor masking). Nope. Everybody tested wore N95 respirators, cloth surgical masks. Respirators rapid rests scarce expensive months ago, impossible pandemic.

Could now? Probably. However wasting tests like testing widely available would criminal. Since people wear masks outside they're vaccinated, nothing much change. normal going get Honestly said ""fuck it"" required vaccine. cares vocal group objects. stay home.

While one principles Burning Man inclusion, think principle civic responsibility contributing spread disease would easily outweigh it.   anyone love needs assistance eating disorder organizations provide connections treatment options well information eating disorders.

*Yikes.* realize that‚Äôs inevitable right? point there‚Äôs going event people come home covid. act like people going come home brain cancer reality probably experience bad flu symptoms reason catch covid. people would stop mask protests accept wearing mask inside store ‚Äúnormal‚Äù now, would much better off.

What nuts? event? want event become known ""come catch COVID"" event? That's going market well, mention public health disaster. stupid take. I've seen pictures absolutely distanced people getting vaccines kind horrified seeing. doubt it.  Brazil vaccinated people, proportional H1N1 lot developed countries. Milwaukee mayor never said, ""Here cases death rates need see relax/eliminate mandate."" messaging been, ""Get vaccine, nothing change do. Things might change future, can't tell science I'm using judge make change. hold breath."" Frustrating, I'm favor vaccine would love see everyone get it. advocating mRNA use india, afaik keeping vaccines adequately cold transport people rural india would real challenge, outright impractical. hurting you? want less people vaccinated?  idea, personally wouldn‚Äôt risk it. doctors opinion would wise. would matter demographic mostly young people unvaccinated, get mild covid week? It‚Äôs negligible healthcare system probably little effect outlook cases. Even more, point chances superspreader occuring first place incredibly low considering potential number people fully vaccinated time. less likely anybody comes sick first place. Plus, young people issue, require fucking vaccination get in? I‚Äôm sure agree proposal, it‚Äôs stupid outright cancel probably piss lot people would requiring vaccination restrictions. got vaccinated.

That first two different people mentioned above. Bolsonaro refused 160 million Sinovac doses last year (60 million would delivered last year).  
Refused 70 million Pfizer doses August, start deliverable December. Please tell more. keep seeing stuff ferritin levels COVID I'm deeply curious it. I'm even curious saying true. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs big deal?‚Äù isn‚Äôt argument infringe rights. got vaccinated, please quit telling people mask up. Actually vaccines using Covishield (ie AstraZenaca vaccines). small minority Covaxin (inactivated viruses). small office, one provider, 2 MAs, 4 receptionists refused vaccine. another provider office died Covid two staff members lost fathers it. really don‚Äôt get it. People generally stupid selfish, sadly. Somewhere inbetween July 4 August probably best guess end mask mandate indoors. cetainly zero interest returning events require masking distancing throughout -- especially hot weather like summer.  hit nail head.

In India, human population plenty, common civic sense hard come by. that, perfect recipe pandemic requires change social behaviour.

As unfathomable might many, idiots still going proclaiming covid harm them. (*Screams internally*) Exactly. Even people recovered Covid without hospitalized experiencing long-term effects. CUNY won‚Äôt requiring unfortunately hope SUNY Many kids admitted reasons. study says kids asymptomatic, detected tested Covid hospitalized (not hospitalized Covid). Kids tend hospitalized monitor closely given younger ages. nephew admitted overnight pulse ox 85 mild wheezing, discharged next day.

There many transient causes children admitted , also surgeries related general health (orthopedic, tonsillectomy, etc) logistics issue, already done already offer 20 vaccines free public health system. 
We already vaccinate 80 million yearly flu, public health system. 

Every neighborhood there's clinic, people assigned it. clinic knows what's happening locals. 
 
A example: months ago, car's clinic neighbor got Measles shot, house, vaccine, offering vaccinate.  
That's manage 99% people vaccinated BCG, 95% Measles.

In small towns, going house giving COVID vaccine. 

It's lack of.... vaccines.

Over 94% people aged 60 older vaccinated Rio first dose (AZ/Sinovac), example. Honestly seropositivity rates US missing enough cases seed new outbreaks, part states people actually believe virus real seropositivity rates populations roughly match confirmed cases. 

Difference US India January limited issues getting people tested, mostly lab backlog hold up. happening India right enough rest world actually accurately capture true scope cases, even India kind money throw US. I'm guessing thought whole pandemic bullshit supported public health measures begin with. probably give answer directly, might data could visualize certain things topic. data different country (Netherlands), directly comparable. youngest age group ""under 50"", particularly young, considered young severe COVID-19.

Especially 50 group seeing lot hospital admissions compared previous waves. probably due vaccinations, might due variants. importantly, compare results earlier year/ last year. interesting see combined wave first, see split since March.

F. think people upset true. government acting like 21st June return normal, restrictions dropped - masks, social distancing, significant capacity limits sport hospitality huge restrictions! Five reasons June 21 won‚Äôt return normal thought

Legal powers impose domestic Covid-19 restrictions already extended Parliament September

June 21 burned public consciousness day life finally return normal Britain reach destination Boris Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äúone-way road freedom‚Äù.

But growing signs Covid-19 restrictions remain place long summer solstice.

The Government‚Äôs scientific advisers want ‚Äúbaseline measures‚Äù, including social distancing, continue another year, councils hiring Covid marshals start work July, vaccine passports already trialled.

Meanwhile, legal powers impose domestic Covid-19 restrictions extended Parliament September, international travel restrictions expected stay place many months.

The Prime Minister insists ‚Äúthe end really sight‚Äù, increasingly seems may apply telescope.

Social distancing

While Government confident restrictions meeting friends family (such the[ so-called Rule cease June 21, appears increasingly likely form social distancing stay place.

Ministers conducting review '[one metre-plus allows restaurant customers, office workers others sit one metre apart mitigations screens extra ventilation place.

Pubs warned one metre-plus rule stays place, disaster them, need full make profit. hospitality bosses pessimistic possibility seeing punters crammed shoulder shoulder bar time soon.

Theatres, cinemas, nightclubs venues rely full houses turn profit also anxiously awaiting results government review.

Data indoor trial events [World Snooker Luna Cinema Liverpool Circus Nightclub, also Liverpool, analysed decision made social distancing.

A second phase pilots begin end May, meaning results unlikely known time June 21.

Kate Nicholls, chief executive UK Hospitality, said: ""Unless Government lifts restrictions full businesses remain unviable able make profit. question ministers is, give economy long Covid keeping restrictions place?""

Sporting events

The first major sporting event take place June 21 Wimbledon tennis tournament, starts June 28, organisers warned public far cry business usual.

On Tuesday, England Club‚Äôs chairman Ian Hewitt said crowds could restricted 25 per cent capacity, players stay bio-secure hotels face fines ¬£14,000 breach Covid-19 security rules.

Mr Hewitt said: ‚ÄúWe plan deliver best Championships possible accordance public safety. necessarily different Wimbledon know it.‚Äù

Football‚Äôs FA Cup final May 15 take place front 20,000 fans, instead Wembley‚Äôs 90,000 capacity, meaning trials outdoor sporting events still early stage June 21.

Covid Marshals

If legal restrictions lifted June 21, one thing country surely need Covid Marshals.

Yet, councils around country advertising jobs [Covid start July continue next year.

They include Hertfordshire County Council, advertised ¬£3 million contract 60 Covid Marshals start work July 1 Jan 31 next year, possible extension one year, meaning could place 2023.

Their job ‚Äúaid encourage compliance‚Äù help public businesses ‚Äúunderstand regulations guidance‚Äù.

The council says planning possible third wave would ‚Äúdereliction duty‚Äù marshals place part preparations eventuality.

It also insisted recruitment Covid Marshals ‚Äúis indicative increases restrictions July 2021 onwards‚Äù.

The marshals enforcement powers, public reacts challenged legal restrictions lapsed remains seen.

Vaccine passports test entry

The Government‚Äôs pilots indoor outdoor events rely Covid-19 status certification allow crowds return sport customers return restaurants, theatres nightclubs.

Early pilots so-called Events Research Programme relying pre-entry testing alone, later pilots, starting end next month, attempt incorporate data vaccination acquired immunity, words, vaccine passports.

The Government also said ‚Äúcommitted explore whether Covid-status certification might used reopen economy‚Äù, ‚Äúcould allow freedoms restored safely‚Äù.

It believes certificates ‚Äúcould important role play domestically internationally temporary measure‚Äù.

Official guidance businesses pubs restaurants states ‚Äúeven without Government intervention, Covid-status certification likely become feature lives threat pandemic recedes‚Äù.

Ministers reluctant ban businesses requiring customers demonstrate Covid-19 status, meaning vaccine passports test entry likely feature everyday life time come.

Face coverings

The visible proof restrictions come face coverings finally consigned history, unlikely happen June 21.

Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser, stated publicly expects face coverings necessary next winter, Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies (Sage) believes ‚Äúbaseline measures‚Äù mask wearing social distancing might necessary ‚Äúthroughout winter 2021/22‚Äù.

The use face coverings also subject review.

Regardless whether recommends masks worn crowded spaces train carriages, seems likely public either advised wear them, choose so, gradual return normality leads increase commuting, shopping tightly-packed audiences.  covishield also ‚Ä¶means base formulation? 2% seem like reasonable mortality rate country relatively young population. 0.2% would closer think. wrong many levels it‚Äôs almost scary. UK contract stronger. [the EU's Guy Verhofstadt (who studied law entering politics) say EU contract based ‚Äúestimated time schedule‚Äù, full stop. British contract contrast, precisely described procedure guarantee timely delivery doses. procedure based ‚Äúpreliminary calendar‚Äù (with five delivery dates volumes). AstraZeneca obliged notify UK authorities ultimately 30 days advance details deliveries. notified, AstraZeneca longer escape precise commitments without permission UK authorities. minor variance dates (up 5 business days) compared delivery schedule possible due ‚Äúunpredictable nature manufacturing products‚Äù, called ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù. foreseen EU agreement.

And conclusion (his emphasis, sum, **balance power tilts notably towards UK.** Considering timing difference approach two contracts, appears coincidence. live India Indonesia. People shit directly rivers, wash clothes, etc. it.

If go jungle fine, IME even passing one village river already slightly icky. I'm strongly doubtful river 'quite clean' city 250,000, especially million people extra people, significant number shitting river, washing hair, etc. Dont many generally try leave india though?  record, state restaurant outbreaks still happening publicly announced outbreak restaurant anyone specific timeframe tested, like measles outbreaks announced. states done this, since customers easily traceable. spreads like measles, treated like measles, although fortunately less infectious measles.  thing happened Europe 2nd wave, arguably happening Denmark right now. We're normalizing 10% vaccinated apparently we've beat virus. Despite image India making clear that's dangerous line thought. baffling seeing exceptionalism repeat across world. Hopefully vaccines eventually bring pandemic end. much unnecessary suffering exceptionalism - even post-lockdown state 'respect' continued risks infection important. Politicians need stop proclaiming premature victory. England, estimated 7 10 adults 68.3% adult population (95% credible interval: 63.9% 73.0%) would tested positive antibodies coronavirus ‚Äì SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äì blood test week ending 11 April 2021, suggesting infection past Wales, estimated 6 10 adults, 61.0% adult population (95% credible interval: 55.9% 66.5%) would tested positive antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood test week ending 11 April 2021, suggesting infection past Northern Ireland, estimated 6 10 adults, 62.5% adult population (95% credible interval: 56.4% 70.9%) would tested positive antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood test week ending 11 April 2021, suggesting infection past Scotland, estimated 6 10 adults, 57.8% adult population (95% credible interval: 52.9% 63.1%) would tested positive antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood test week ending 11 April 2021, suggesting infection past vaccinated.

The UK reports immediate figures literally **people died within 28 days positive COVID test**. Exactly that, less. number see Worldometer, newspapers, bandied someone ""deaths yesterday"" number. death certificate available 11 14 days, post like one (or newspaper article, news source) says ""X people died **yesterday** COVID"" UK comes figure. figure see Worldometer people died cause within 28 days COVID test.

This newsworthy UK first wave, back UK reporting deaths positive COVID test regardless long ago test (e.g. people died 70 days positive COVID test counted COVID death even though almost certainly died cause); ended reduce death count thousands many non-COVID deaths counted. UK publishes two figures: one *yesterday*, gets reported press shows Worldometer people died within 28 days positive test, another one lags 14 days COVID death certificate - everyone ignores, information 11-14 days ago interest press much.

The method reporting immediate figure anyone died within 28 days positive test is, way, entirely reasonable death rate ~100 per 100,000 infected. numbers would cause COVID. death rate COVID fallen ~10 per 100,000 infected vaccination, ""deaths yesterday"" figure accurate method. makes vaccines ‚Äúexperimental gene therapies?‚Äù Flights cheaper Canada? idea is? always thought America cheaper flights. family member die last year COVID Sevier County.

The outdoor event very, crowded. one physically distance even wanted to. 

Even india spread due personal interactions. Last year people cautious outside gave precautions meeting relatives friends. 

Last year family, extended family totally around 60 people got infected festival invite meals houses. 

I believe indian government never focused interpersonal interactions, due confusing restrictions people misunderstood virus. Everyone thinks people know can't positive. They're vary strangers only. 

Due lack proper messaging, even though dad suggested festival year maybe invite twice next year, outnumbered. ""It'll us"". 

Everyone needs cautious spend 5 minutes so. 

Walking streets, buying something, etc big danger meeting friend also met friend on. This. make vaccine available can't make people take it. encourage try educate refuse, refuse, right. point reopen, otherwise restricting vaccinated aren't.

Oh, 60 million doses per month. That's enough overcome pandemic. people care immunosuppressed. get vaccine, may work well them. children can't yet get vaccinated, and, low risk, still risk, especially older children.

And could easily tell people two ""wear masks indoor someone house.""

Implying outside dangerous counter-productive. people knew dinner patio freinds like 1/1000th dangerous house, we'd stopped virus faster.

Wearing mask walking around outside, friend visiting inside house (which people average wore masks) fucking stupid. long willing put life hold people clearly never going get vaccine living essentially pre-covid lives since last summer?

Reminds doctors saw posting Twitter, said people ICU die Covid, get hooked respirator, screaming Covid, misdiagnosed them. Still marching cult march hour death. 

That's strong propaganda is. vaccine literally takes away entire risk.

This categorically false. profoundly reduces risk, definitely eliminate entirely. understand point, fortunately worst I‚Äôve heard person might want take next day work good advice. fear mongering definitely control certainly hope one would take observations reason get vaccinated pretty much vaccines cause short term discomfort. Anyway, hopefully people look past fear go ahead get vaccinated, I‚Äôd needed too. What‚Äôs point? prevent people getting sick, saving lives, lowering risk getting sick? sure anyone needs that. protesters‚Äô actions rooted deep emotion...it counterproductive bulldoze feelings present facts numbers....we need emotional real stories people losing family members loved ones...

But problem myriad experts data show measures governments implemented work collateral damage terms deaths missed screenings, delayed surgeries, poverty, loneliness, despair far outweighs number people saved.

My province pretty open minimal deaths entire pandemic, 1500 people. thing pandemic shown healthcare system Canada joke. takes bring hospitals knees major work needs done fix it. Pfizer seems best one vaccines, highly effective relatively mild, any, side effects. 

Anecdotally, sister got J&amp;J bad side effects. girlfriend got Pfizer nothing either two shots. remember saying that. seems like oversight include chart. all, person chooses PCR Yes would. Vaccinating twice flu season would likely vaccination effectiveness rate 79% 0.5 2 months vaccination, dropped 60% 2-4 months, 57% 4-6 months, 45% 6-9 allow smoking public buildings due health dangers yet i'm apt get covid shopping trip store unvaccinated unmasked people get cancer time period.

as saying goes right swing fist ends tip another's nose.

Many businesses required vaccination years pneumonia, influenza. Passports come countries require certain vaccinations like yellow fever without people coming unglued.

Sadly I'm seeing articles states legislation banning sort requirement covid19 vaccines vaccination. want medical workers vaccines working loved ones? right mind want relatives nursing home without even flu pneumonia requirement? argh   little fatigued doubt European nations. slow start really picking speed; nearly 100,000 shots per day NL increasing lately. people born 1961 getting invitations, see reason why, current pace disruptions, reaching stated goal people aged 50+ getting invites mid-May. much pessimism, many people saying get ""until 2022"", really going true wait get volition.

TL;DR: Keep chin up. word?

""Disgusting!"" get snow,

Yet hours away skiing. Surf morning ski afternoon? know people done that. 1.	Because vaccines 100% effective therefore ""gramma"" could still become infected
2.	The virus spreads higher probability vaccine-avoidant strain occuring causing additional lockdowns, economic damage, deaths, etc. science mask deniers would eventually end getting covid apart herd immunity vaccinated would. Vaccinations easier faster oft times work better. CDC came said ""if fully vaccinated, 2 wks final shot need mask"" bet demand would go CRAZYYYY vaccines lol. lot healthy people getting they're thinking incentive still live like living now? looks like Michigan's cases also dropping pretty quickly. There‚Äôs shit load laws regarding handle remains. least Illinois work, breaking comes jail time. Moderna Pfizer shown around 80% effective 2 weeks first dose. understand want wait extra protection get 2nd dose.

Pharmacist given 1000‚Äôs vaccines point(pro-vaccine fully vaccinated). CDC released data last week ~6000 breakthrough cases Covid fully vaccinated individuals. I.e fully vaccinated still tested positive. ~6000, 253 required hospitalization, hospitalized ~120 died. 

Out ~97 million fully vaccinated individuals. (Another 141 million least one dose). 

The chances getting sick vaccinated infinitesimal. fact info graphic doesn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre fully vaccinated ever heck want beyond me. Fear works continue use doesn‚Äôt. Look don‚Äôt want happen lead scientist government fully expect least good 1000, dose mean vaccine don‚Äôt work need lockdown, it‚Äôs reality covid, let‚Äôs keep getting vaccine children hopefully it‚Äôs 10000 rather 40,000 Terminology correction: 95% refers protection symptoms, necessarily infection. important distinction. Read as: vaccinated, 95% reduced chance symptoms compared unimmunized person. 

The studies designed calculations based number symptomatic cases certain threshold. means remove bias could created likely exposed lifestyle choices. 

Because get sick mildly (thus 100% claim protect serious illness), extremely likely vaccine did, fact, confer immunity Covid. important discount vaccines ‚Äúlesser‚Äù efficacy. It‚Äôs also majority vaccines work ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections particularly worrisome point. extended family member multiple transplants thus  immunocompromised. kids 12 vaccinated. get frustrated watching vaccination rates slowing already. good, lets hope keeps dropping. Michigan 35% state fully vacced, another % antibodies wondering daily cases still high \~50% pool getting vaccine natural immunity?  complied rules 13 months, fully vaccinated, wait go back normal waiting anti vaxxer anti maskers get vaccinated reach herd immunity?

we follow rules long continue put lives hold everyone clearly give shit living normal lives since last summer? liars say they‚Äôre vaccinated, also it‚Äôs also 100% effective. JnJ like 70% effective Pfizer/Moderna 90-95%. situations transmission still likely, like indoor even crowded outdoor situations, places likely liars unknown status people, still makes sense. I'm sorry friends loss. vaccinate 100% effective. Means still become ill even vaccinated. People still careful even vaccinated higher risk age groups, especially infection rate India right now. laying low smart thing infection rates lowers. forget eggs, love bringing eggs lately. people please stop saying ‚Äúvaccinated people still spread virus‚Äù justify anxiety going back world? it‚Äôs common argument covid antivaxxers. ‚ÄúWell still get spread what‚Äôs point‚Äù Indeed original plan give 60s based benefits preventing hospitalisation death vs. risk rare blood clots. lot anxiety still remained regarding blood clot risk AstraZeneca vaccine, government decided open anyone (above 18) who's willing take now. Convenient everyone chance get fully vaccinated can‚Äôt tell someone fully vaccinated looking them.

If got first shot yesterday, would feel lot comfortable people around wearing masks.

In 2-3 months might point, right you‚Äôre ass. see point keep businesses money. business going WANT this. done governments require it. Example: concert without requiring it, would rather less hassle, cost less, etc. require government makes them. false. original studies conducted variants see widely circulating - even Pfizer/Moderna admit that. sure, guess question vaccinated using ""spread gramma"" argument...your gramma shot, fine.. That's awful still avoid getting infected N95 on. insanity remove mask photo really messes takes away means protection leaves vulnerable. agree, see broad general things like vaccines seem working lol...how seeing #s saying \_million people vaccinated \_ gotten covid 2wks following last shot \_ died...maybe would push people get shots think they're working general ""get vaccine wear masks outside"" message Yeah guess what, stupid shit like helps variants take hold eventually something emerge fucks us back square one. Exactly, one earth. Covid climate change needs approach. I'm 1 dose in, still go work go home/outside exercise I'm risking crap 3 weeks now, second dose + wait period. would honestly pissed get sick point, job inside maskless people.

What? Medium-Rare (145F) [safe cooking whole pieces/cuts meat (not ground). exactly reason. CDC telling us think need hear optimal societal behavior, science actually says individual safety. Schools 2 week break cases going opened up, pubs restaurants, gym barber compares 200 people busy pub, specially since won‚Äôt vaccinated, rise cases ain‚Äôt bad, come build immunity health companies higher rates unvaccinated workers business insurance liability regarding possability staff infecting customers full authorization.

Never considered aspect. like it.  Getting Covid middle desert sounds like living hell. it‚Äôs ‚Äúrespectful‚Äù go back needing masks. It‚Äôs technically always respectful wear bubble suit one gets sick around disease. problem mask wearing fully vaccinated people bubble point coming officials talking about. wear masks places like grocery stores workers forced wear them. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated state lifted mandatory rules. one maybe 1/3 follow point. it‚Äôs time cdc starts saying either working give date it. country, want get vaccine can. means got shot today. could fully vaccinated mid June.

I knew India doomed moment Wuhan locked down, what's poverty overpopulation, kind stupidity unforgivable. like want people get infected know? seen others wearing masks outside themselves? Cause I've always worn masks outside I'm sure I'm one... ironic see article since Feb. 2020, ppl Reddit saying East Asians especially susceptible. agree. original comment made ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre waiting herd immunity prepare wait forever.‚Äù üòÖ hope true least increase incentives vaccination (day shots, bonus, something) deterrents choosing vaccinate. collages require weekly testing unvaccinated allow person classes vaccinated. 

I wonder insurance companies encouraging vaccination health companies higher rates unvaccinated workers business insurance liability regarding possability staff infecting customers full authorization. dunno man, I‚Äôve seen perfectly normal people abnormally scared covid. 

Also, matter she‚Äôs living someone high risk? vaccine literally takes away entire risk. Statistically, person end hospital. It‚Äôs nearly impossible. called called one bosses going Florida May one. Depends are. don‚Äôt  Answer simple - vaccines 100% effective, hence want 'you' take father get sick case unlucky portion.

then would types complain and/or cower about? people empathy may come shock: hate people disagree with, certainly want die. drag Josh Allen make get shot Mitch Tribiski start 2 games gets covid mid-season? obviously speculation seems government told festivals good go, hence building sets, creating contracts, rescinded advice hence cancellations. 

No one clue situation summer, looks like barring disaster covid feel like distant memory August maybe that‚Äôs wishful thinking. sense, government picked line stuck rather causes festivals cancel mid-construction. Even line ‚Äòno way‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs opinion government offering more, provide financial support festivals. 
If reason can‚Äôt function August gov promised underwrite certain % revenue festival stood make losses wouldn‚Äôt unbearable cancellation occur due rules. 

The events industry fundamentally failed likely won‚Äôt bounce back many many years another summer toilet. Got link?

I found doesn‚Äôt list restrictions remove. maybe means everything except masks. Like friends, Dr. Wollowitz vaccinated January. produce antibodies response ‚Äî expect to. one millions Americans immunocompromised, whose bodies cannot learn deploy immune fighters immunocompromised people born absent faulty immune systems, others, like Dr. Wollowitz, diseases received therapies wiped immune defenses. Many produce antibodies response vaccine infection, leaving susceptible virus. become infected, may suffer prolonged illness, death rates high 55 people lived immune deficiencies long time likely aware vulnerability. others idea medications may put walking around outside thinking they‚Äôre protected ‚Äî maybe they‚Äôre not,‚Äù said Dr. Lee Greenberger, chief scientific officer Leukemia Lymphoma Society, funds research blood cancers.

So, trouble necessarily people *know* risk - lot people walking around thinking vaccine protecting isn't. believe case? comments advocating lifting supply blockade lifting IP restrictions always downvoted? legitimate concern CDC said need tested quarantine knowingly exposed Covid 19 vaccinated. right tell anyone CDC concerned vaccinated transmission point time, everybody I‚Äôm friends knows it‚Äôs time mess around pull multiple bottles various sunscreens. I‚Äôm letting friends burn sunny day lmao. It‚Äôs avoidable pain probably link ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù dudes laugh off. Fun fact: people know form skin cancer dudes. 

Just wear damn sunscreen, guys. Social pressure honestly doubt many people staying home point. quite, since transmission rate COVID 100%, 5 percent transmission rate. And, way efficacy tested, percentage 'average' idealized person doesnt really exist. So, isolated 'average' person -- maybe dont kids going school work home, youre probably going even lower chance. opposite course also true, constantly public likelihood gonna higher.

In sum agree guidelines make sense overall population, end though think definitely common sense judgement calls made either less cautious individual basis.  people supposed able tell?

Pretty sure mess diagram interpreted ""outside == masks"". Yeah mistake people making levels throughout pandemic. Everyone worried people do, one tells truth one trusts ""other side.""  Variants spiking people still ignoring cdc guidelines. concern variant mutate point infects vaccinated people. What‚Äôs wrong wearing mask medium large crowds? fucking dumb.

   ""Testing positive"" virtually meaningless measure. matters person actually sick not. doubt she‚Äôd working 9-5 guess really problem public health issues: really depends actions people around you. lot people state aren‚Äôt getting vaccines, looks like months hit 75% herd immunity measure go back normal  one said forever saying things black white way every time doesn‚Äôt help.

We‚Äôre easing restrictions moving one step time towards normalcy, *will* get there. rough set facts approximate relatively accurate numbers demostration.

India population 1 billion.

Survival rate 99%

Without lockdown, anticipate 10 million dead. disaster unprecedented proportions. lockdowns similar US, reduce tenfold. Excess deaths US 2020 around 12%. India sees around 10 million dead annually (7.3 per 1,000). lockdowns, drop deaths 1 million.

So absolute terms 200k vs 9 million. Brutal math stake.

Now, kicker. 99% survival weighted across demographics. also assumes robust infrastructure treat everyone. explosion cases due lokdown, even 1% increase mortality 98% sees another 10 million dead.

And that's deaths covid. even touch caregivers heavily impacted. So, let's guess every 4 deaths, (mom/dad/2 granndparents) 1 child becomes orphan. Without lockdown 99%, 2 million orphans. well social system support many more?  well.

So, 200k dead vs 9 million dead 2 million orphans. Suddenly lockdown look bad.

If get realistic move death rate 95% due collapsed infrastructure, that's 45 million dead 10 million orphans.

You want cry 200k deaths? Please. ocean blood tearing bucket.  Same. I'm New Jersey, New York City travel Manhattan doctor appointments, everyone city wears masks outside. interesting see shifts mindset.

Masks suck, period. sooner get rid better. extra first dose vaccine harmful?

My wife (39) (37) chance get first dose AstraZeneca vaccine Taiwan immigrate US. arrive US (5 weeks getting first dose AZ), able get second dose brand vaccine. harmful risky start new vaccine arrive? reason we'd get AstraZeneca lower risk getting COVID-19 traveling, stop us infecting anybody inevitably helps us get settled. I've read, getting one dose vaccine significantly lowers risk, even though technically primer second dose, provides resistance infection. concern getting total three doses (one AZ, two another US) might somehow bad us. called department health US state I'll living, said get first dose here. friend, doctor, saw problem it. I'm confused! first date always wear figurative mask.  It‚Äôs good swag number. Though suspect it‚Äôs actually quite bit low-ball. 

1) People COVID already likely skipping vaccine, 

2) COVID deniers willfully ignoring placing much riskier environments likely gotten COVID already. **Covid variants enters chat** Yeah, Fauci definitely politician guys.. chest beating Brussels provide us entertainment UK I‚Äôm sure     Moderna? Moderna requires 4 weeks shots. Pfizer 3 weeks. Aye dispute that. think masks great.   I'm highly skeptical media. also think coverage situation greatly exaggerated Italy well. 

My understanding one region hit extremely hard initially, region got media coverage. You‚Äôre correct. People get weirdly conspiratorial order make point seem edgy website. It‚Äôs strange. get providing updates helpful people haven‚Äôt wearing masks outdoors begin with. want push vaccine compliance need start laying better timelines, especially state level. Okay, 50% state one shot. drop capacity restrictions? mask mandate emergency order end? don‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt give hesitant people incentive get vaccinated point still hasn‚Äôt gotten it. California highest demand vaccines mask mandates generally even cautious CDC whole. Whether California overly cautious open question think hard argue high vaccine use + high restrictions created situation dramatically reduced spread Covid. too!  intents purposes vaccinated person, doesn't. Studies shown there's approximately 0.5% chance getting Covid vaccination I‚Äôm CHECKING YA concern Chicago going phone app, designed rushed door weeks. probably going rely state's vaccination registry, incomplete even attempt record state vaccinations (the governor encouraged Chicagoans go Indiana get vaccine sooner). going need modern smart phone run app, immediately makes discriminatory poor elderly. basically zero chance works well required attend city events. Ironically, I‚Äôm German got Moderna instead BioNtech. Globalisation sometimes useful. :)  friend said may trying get deal Spotify he's ticking much can. crazy crazy theory. know go. 100M lot money. sub care long term health consequences apparently. Masks actually still help prevent virus entering lungs here's study: say 6ft safe. said study found distancing ""beyond 6 feet good.""  That's nice. know person caught within week two they‚Äôre first injection they‚Äôre ventilator. 

Getting covid close finish line got worst possible thing happen, especially incredibly cautious point People aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated weren‚Äôt wearing masks outdoors begin likely indoors either. wrong nihilism? Honestly I'd take we're subject hard lockdown time cases pop up. Listening Eddie Bravo speak made feel like brain melting.

We're still learning virus spreads people get vaccinated. Another example sanitation surfaces - outbreak first started, CDC advice sanitize surfaces like every pathogen, months later we've learned ultimately unnecessary since virus survive long surfaces like influenza does. Better cautious.

There's also social aspect. see bunch people walking around maskless, chances ditch mask even unvaccinated, thus contributing problem potential outbreak asymptomatic carrying virus yourself. requiring _everyone_ mask we've achieved herd immunity, chance reduced.

Wouldn't vaccine personal choice? reduce symptoms one it, group vaccinated people still able spread around. U.K., vaccinating thousand people minute months ago. BJ‚Äôs talking another wave? sick all. ask listen refuse listen Rogan

Really? Why? He's important. MMA something? J&amp;J 70% effective preventing severe covid. vaccine prevents covid entirely. reduce transmission 50% within household.

Your use ‚Äúonly‚Äù two sentences imply think they‚Äôre effective enough.  listen podcast every week love Nia now, used pretty insufferable feminist pretty much racist takes. definitely mellowed right along Bill though.

Saying ""If young healthy see much benefit vaccine"" opinion. people allowed opinions anymore? many good ones. 

The one ticket takers trains always appear happy enjoying episode QI stands memory. 

The gist kind shitty unpleasant job, yet expected always appear jolly pleasant job. *Everyone* knows job jolly pleasant. what's damn point? let kind stoic sure polite openly friendly get day, job sucks stop making worse making pretend doesn't. people around also taken vaccine. Ever heard herd immunity? vast majority people anti vaxers republicans well ... agree fair automatically pin two together.  amazing many accounts constantly say exact thing exact way? wonder motivation come from, inspiring curated message listen CDC? government mean big tobacco companies, right? US government along many states ones sued pants companies making fraudulent studies. certainly scientific consensus tobacco good you. studies bought paid big tobacco.  37 fully vaccinated doctors came Covid-19 earlier month India. Israel reports vaccine less effective strain. quantity infections unlike anything we've seen yet

Might indicator strain contagious. India thought control, sloppy that, new strain could add problem.

I say MIGHT be. see. reported Israel, Switzerland, UK, US, countries better genome tracking India. Nice math work---interesting.  mean stool fucker   Thank God. see cuomo say ""right?!"" move creepy hands like he's turning dial again, know I'll do... TRT even cycling people. likely HGH makes everything grow fact 55% enough Israel keeps going. think reach number countries.   Exactly, responsibility actually give certain people platform. Vaccines 100% effective slim chance vaccinated person become infected asymptomatically, still certain ability pass virus onto people. still rare though I'm sure reasons. Japanese government seems pretty set unless athletes refuse come large enough numbers force cancellation it‚Äôs happening. Bro don‚Äôt need ask permission cdc meet immune people lmao i‚Äôm saying analogy shit lol, need throw temper tantrum it. 

people wear seatbelts high risk accident riding car. lot different covid, get vaccinated risk catching spreading virus low. reason would continue wear masks? *you* suggest do? lol. I‚Äôm pretty sure recommendation now. Fully vaccinated people free meet whatever capacity like. They‚Äôre important. It‚Äôs one aspect kids lives haven‚Äôt taken year. parents kids believe benefit outweighs risk choose compete. question problem it?   go further. ""When X percent people get vaccinated, *vaccinated* people take masks indoors anything want."" People definitely get vaccine think give advantage others.

See, infographic got wrong. People care getting red/yellow green, care allowed without mask. people's attitude they're fated get it, it'll happen whatever precautions take.  Let's make fun reddit. fix things like always does! You‚Äôre absolutely right. Normally I‚Äôd leave answer everyone could see dialog back forth, it‚Äôs public safety info, I‚Äôm throwing edit.   Even 100% people world got vaccinated, still live animal reservoirs. Smallpox able eradicated that.  Oh yeah agree, much like him. reference something heard Joe Rogan like 8 years ago every time I'm really embarrassed. actually interesting people podcast, anyway, needs careful gives audience to. key word, used be. try checking commentary recent MMA events. offers insights always biased hell sometimes legitimately describe whats happening  Whats recent, unknown, development give us covid? Variants spiking media need find something people panic over. art state things well sound convincing. mean person really knows talking (I say like Bill Burr).

On flip side many people depth knowledge, advanced degrees, even good speaking getting thoughts all. Tons young people dying India.

Got data share that? find much recent looked, stuff March saying ~90% older that's all. Rogan definitely Fauci show. someone currently planning wedding, certainly matter large degree (talking specifically gathering limits). Point taken overall, venues part following law vision wedding changes drastically types mandates updated. quit listening last April 4, 2020 flipped actively telling buy wear masks increase risk infections telling wear anything, including t-shirt, face. weeks later flipped telling clean surfaces including food containers, nevermind matter. speak impending doom, despite vaccinating 3 million people day, announcement yesterday seems completely tone deaf. guess maybe still listen them, enjoy getting annoyed say. say something different every time. think meant say celebrities including ones like saying things agree with** (unless happen MD) reason there‚Äôs massive campaign celebrities trying influence us medical decisions  less freedom speech (on private, corporate-owned platforms) regressing 300 years able voice position disagrees lynch mob's dogma without burned stake. 

Conversation and/or disagreement certain topics straight allowed anymore.

The far left made religion view reality, hard work trying bring back dark ages.

I vote left literally every single issue - happy opinions challenged feel need destroy people's lives livelihoods seeing things way.

I still eat dinner insufferable Trump-supporting relatives give hugs holidays human beings deserve love, compassion care regardless social / political views.

A certain flavor far left activists side Trump cult's coin. Horseshoe theory real.  Hopefully get delivered timely fashion. They‚Äôre tiny. They‚Äôre actually smaller flu shot needle. barely felt it! look away relax arm, you‚Äôll totally fine. someone explain people fully vaccinated still must wear mask indoors? never happen yea, sounds great. Oh, another one reddit's joe-rogan-hate-thread, neat Ironic coming you. It‚Äôs people much like reason god forsaken pandemic going longer should. swear god brain smaller COVID droplets. CDC guidelines say that... say safe long *outside* fully vaccinated people.
 AKA: socially distanced, without mask.

Which almost exactly thing they've saying since day one: long stay 6ft apart outside, safe... describing called ""lack empathy"".

I straight, white, middle-aged, middle-class man. Voting Trump directly hurt short-term voting Republican always hurts long -term. voting purely based hurt ignoring millions people hurt immediately disgusting, nearly sociopathic behavior.

Bill Burr lot smarter Joe Rogan. he's smart either. idea ‚Äúsome‚Äù people post every 30 minutes tidbit life. people take ‚Äúpause‚Äù posting days weeks one stretch may indicate sick, perhaps Covid. couldn‚Äôt say don‚Äôt post damn thing profile time capsule 2009. get generational wealth scruples. Joe Rogan Goop dudes. vaccinated people / vaccinated population)

That‚Äôs calculate efficacy. vast majority people wouldn‚Äôt caught virus even hadn‚Äôt vaccinated didn‚Äôt happen exposed timeframe. hive mind sub becoming unbearable. 

I'm reopening America, completely fair criticize 100% reopening ball park soon, Atlanta places. Georgia among lowest vaccine rates entire country, 1/3 population vaccinated all, 20% doses. 

People able criticize brash move without voted oblivion. seen they'll believe drop hat, getting need stop believing things drop hat. 

We need discussion, dialogue, disagreements, less deplatforming, less cancel culture, attempt understand opposing opinion good faith, call what's wrong wrong.  missed that. FDA approving vaccine? Anyone IQ 70 able differentiate them. Speak 69er. Didnt eat dog dicks something morons morons. what's new? remember beginning pandemic people wear masks took medical advice CDC WHO. Perhaps Israel, CDC released data posted week ago.  speculation course, imagine vaccine didn‚Äôt take, get hospitalized died. imagine medically serious co-morbidities otherwise ‚Äúnormally healthy individuals‚Äù  It'll best adhd infused storytelling ever heard  Ah yes cause whatever nonsensical deflection gave equivalent Joe calling people insults wearing masks discouraging people get vaccinated level. not. Yup got source bud? that's true. all.

[This poll states 60% definitely want vaccine it, 13% outright NPR poll says 1 4 Americans want it. case can't math that's 75% favor vaccine.

Along countless polls similar results. Plus, number people want vaccine rising people fence realizing vaccine changing DNA whatever. Jeez good guys. We‚Äôre like 100k Ontario day, hurts see world open I‚Äôm stuck apartment, could worse guess‚Ä¶ demographic never going get vaccinated rate high enough achieve herd immunity. sure plan exactly.  People stand around talk watch dogs. probably wear mask there. sort message kinds make people expect invincible mask, true. Jaysom Tatum, professional basketball player 24 years old peak health contracting Covid still needs use inhaler every game. **months** recovered. summer? don‚Äôt even think mine 2022 summer Eventually, start recognizing folks crappy.

If spend ton time effort cultivate place people crappy you, think actually shows folks generally crappy. lot do. Poor countries need vaccinate way vaccines people young people, watch traditional television. need major push break insulated messaging Under-30 crowd stewing in. ""I'm young, need vaccine."" That's indoctrinated online conspiracy Meathead Personality Gurus like Joe Rogan. Yeah no. learned vociferous minority either ignorance adherence self serving agendas attempted derail necessary public health interventions. Simply true. Give one time someone serious told vaccines stop infections Cue denial negativity.

Vaccines magical, even though nearly so. Herd immunity requires participation civic duties almost negatives (i.e., couple dozen cases bad side effects among 200+ million doses).

This time fight arbitrary culture war. Please, big boys girls get shots. Save conspiracy theories favorite tv show pandemic. make YouTube video promising going raise funds them. don't! get actual blowback that? Kazakhstan poor seems. PPP adjusted GDP per capita level Russia due oil gas reserves. certainly money perhaps, inherited good science practices USSR.

That said, surprised question. manage create good vaccine despite middle income country excellent news. densely gathered dog park, standing stationary people also standing stationary? no, you‚Äôre fine. hypocrisy say people responsible ass CHOOSE avoid vaccination, accept full risks consequences get fucked, fault fault alone? Barring people CAN'T get vaccinated, really give 0 shits people refuse vaccine know they're I'm going stop living life (especially makes sense since I'm real danger) someone else's willful choice vulnerable.

Sounds like common stance consistent I've always believed. Before, vaccine, try. Now, vaccinated people really reason give fuck unvaccinated people COULD get vaccinated won't. get sick, better cry it, opportunity protect chose get fucked.

Me, myself? Vaccinated. concern anymore. Hardly begin with. Nice. Time open two those, too. One day Wuhan went lockdown, read virus busy mall. hit happened here, could last time mall while. (Spoiler alert: right.) 

Other one March 13th. week last one went without wearing mask work. tried going grocery shopping, madhouse - people shopping like end world approaching. 

If life boring big dramatic dates like winds down, I‚Äôll count lucky! sure practicalities this, I'm opposed idea. everyone vaccinated would need capacity limits, social distancing, masks, would suck concert. Got second shot today! Feeling fine far regardless, whatever temporary feeling shot gives worth able resume relatively normal life.   Hi familiar stranger :) Yeah, wondering outside scarcity... Apparently we're getting bunch doses May general population start getting vaccines coz right old people pre-existing conditions getting shots. Well good thing CDC decides restrictions politicians. Wearing mask little inconvenience I'm sure cope Covid suppressed vaccine induced herd immunity.  One ten principles Burning Man civic responsibility. Cancelling responsible thing. oh hey moa vax buddy!!! sorry happened first mistake going r/politics live? live Texas, work Walmart, see maybe handful people without mask hundreds come shopping (in 8 hrs I'm working). thought would seen people without mask really changed much since mask mandate ended. Lmao turning point 2 months ago YAHOO!!!! Hm. think may see believe it. *actual* real common sense realise slowly right way point. I'm donkey-brained anti-vaxer anything (In fact, I'm fully vaxed myself) bit curious part wondering nessacary? everyone access vaccine wants one, vaccine exists protect you, really matter prove get one? easily accessible (and time shows start easy getting flu shot) risk person themselves? like flu shot? I'm open wrong seems little bit dramatic step reach time period vaccines easily available. Glad stopped listening him. heard single podcast since moved Spotify True, overlap 16/17 group exists potential pain 12-15 easy fill! Literally one place America everyone wore masks pre-2020 could stay breakers early entry want get key rides early unsubbed sometime Trump got elected. pure, batshit crazy, hysterical Americans like quote.

Damn wanted check half comments deleted lol friend volunteering (not nurse) said ""beginning feel might unsafe"". Um, shit? Right, imagine 2035:

""Oh, know 28, COVID 14, heart damage probably need beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARB rest life. That‚Äôs surprised still thing. Although daughter‚Äôs entire team got Covid 10 get EKG NCAA rules return play none myocarditis. would curious see actual numbers Covid positive people found myocarditis. literally does. it. Remember vote counts, better worse. Japan's response virus practically right Plague Inc. testing, government parties, *travel campaigns*, Olympics... I'm glad I'm getting hell here. think silly look day-by-day trend, decreased 1% week obviously cases decreasing, ICU numbers follow coming weeks. 7 day average deaths US 30% (from 990 706) month.

There's zero reason believe continue fall people getting vaccinated, even 20-somethings get fun desert 4 months. got Pfizer shot.  everyone access vaccine wants one, vaccine exists protect you, really matter prove get one?

Well, 4% US population immunocompromised, would need stay home forever, basically.  Part logistics bringing things burning man involves lot getting together person (or, really, several months ago).

And, optimistic things much better August, certainty.

There reason cancel 2022 yet still plenty time situation become clear. time situation become clear 2021.  may even known. One first known ones 2020 house party 30 people. 20 people could probably trigger one admit there. politicians like Cuomo Newsome... Yikes idk worse tbh Let gather let event make mandatory stay 1 month üôÉ dunno, centralized driver's license facility mails IDs you, could easily changed start churning ""vaccine licenses"" addition driver's licenses.

They're plastic, holograms, etc. delivered mail thanks Real ID Act. already centralized. everyone wants vaccine able complete vaccination cycle yet, folks sub yelling ""but vaccine open everybody!"" seem pretending immunity comes immediately. We're couple weeks away point, yet.

Some areas close. state example, adults eligible vaccine month. much longer justifiably 100% vaccinated state. populism absurdities real problem, around world like said. True.

but case cult con-artist USA different. First vast majority Americans take precautions get vaccinated. minority loud screamers get news every day. latest numbers:

58% get vaccine ASAP

28% hesitant (from ""what get return?"" , ""it's free? Really?"", ""am required take it?"" on

14% get vaccine (followers con-artist/politician, cult, religion absurdities)

not worried ""populism"" US moment. need convince 28% will. 14%? amen. really count. thought outta since vaxxed. happened? It‚Äôs like people going random ppl outside asking ‚Äúhey man, vaccinated? No? Mind putting mask on.‚Äù keep moving. It‚Äôs cute people arms realistically, already people wearing masks, outside subway now. chances catching outside low anyway. you‚Äôre vaccinated, even lower. really isn‚Äôt big deal. Andy ""quite time"" mean 2 weeks. see YouTube. couple weeks least.  Godspeed man. *receives vaccine, builds maximum immunity, enjoys self responsibly vaccinated family gathering*

MY LIFE! don't, one around you, can't really magically get it. I'm nudist hate clothes, would rather wear mask clothes. rules, law, need wear clothes public -- comply.  like record super spreader events contact tracers? would assume might confidential, would informative nonetheless. goal simply sense normalcy

No, goal actual normalcy, sense it. vaccines, goal grasp, kudos LA‚Äôs Governor seizing it.  That's probably special circumstance though since Mardi Gras brought probably-infected people around world. rest US south that. long miss finest gypsy tears.  Stuff involve interacting humans apparently.

Definitely music festivals bars amusement parks.

Time fire Youtubes watch cat videos! WHOOP WHOOP! figured, I'll best careful possible Half billion people infected India, real number health experts saying. Considering they've got orgy tents, I'm going say calling ""outdoor event"" telling whole story. Also, something improves time affects people rest lives? available treatment?

(Not asking directly, article light details.) definitely allow people return, hotel quarantine end. US largely avoided that. bet i'd labeled far right conservative went brought ""real"" info discussion. seems like ""we must follow science"" big thing science goes views suddenly complete free shit show. Huh that's insane 26000 employees many work home still. Planning force return person bet. Even well work home like web support staff. always another side story. couple weeks support requiring masks indoors right?  one ""word"" describes majority mindset, write word comment deleted. talking COVID, vaccines, anti-vaxers, anti-maskers can't use one ""word"". 15% death rate meningitis, vs .01% college-aged students. Hmm. Man, think even .2 multiplier overstates things multiple orders magnitude, otherwise...yep. page. half FloRida ""normal"" - half masking, distancing waiting vaccine. That's probably fool's hope. 40% Americans get flu vaccine every year. Obviously thing (this better vaccine, flu shut world year motivate take it), still, 75% massive jump consider mean ""roughly 40% population readily willing take vaccines"". That‚Äôs great! wonder regional differences mean situation bit better numbers would show.

For example, SF Bay Area already almost 70% age 16+ vaccinated already. even get heard immunity country whole, large regions country might. 

So looking flare-ups regions, would concentrate natural immunity infection require country-wide shut downs. Plus, local flare-ups would probably drive bit vaccine acceptance worst points, like works reductions mobility numbers thebhight local outbreaks. would nice surprise honestly. Boston. Boston going stay mask mandate summer. think NJ will, though; there's chance might pull back summer goes on. Late July-August might better time.  Yep 8 days ICU, wore masks everywhere, still got sneezed oh cashier mask nose got COVID Nothing pandemic fair. don‚Äôt know people expect change now. Yay alaska! Thought hand sanitizer good chance wash hands. Plus people habit touching face. do. Others, not. Everything canceled next year probably universe hates us. even mention professors majority 50's/60's older. yet sat pro vaccine guest could string together five sentences, he'd come interview pro vaccine. I'm firmly convinced convince Joe Rogan ANYTHING 45 minutes. He's Oprah men ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø really need people stop thinking celebs opinions valid expert given subject.  know. Lots people ignorant cowards. pity. Seriously. aren‚Äôt vaccinated September, choice. something businesses could require. concerts start, would others it?  made snare drum vouch fear factor guy scared get COVID vaccine....that's rich Stop wearing unless negatively affects people. terms annoying randos, don‚Äôt yell retail workers it. walk store without one nobody asks stop, there‚Äôs nothing wrong opinion. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong simply isn‚Äôt reason besides fact store rule it. rule isn‚Äôt enforced, doesn‚Äôt hurt employees wear mask you‚Äôre giving Covid you‚Äôre making work more. CDC says quarantine fully vaccinated, also exposure exposure quarantine regardless vaccine status. good! That's vaccine for. Yeah there‚Äôs way you‚Äôre making take vax unless non-GMO, organic, free range crafted local pharma co-op. Meanwhile they‚Äôre gobbling combo mdma, ketamine, poppers.  know many states 100% open right now, ugh, reading NY fair still going pretty restricted August, MA's restrictions going fully lifted August (and even remove indoor mask mandate) makes wonder might wrong normal summer. Wasn‚Äôt sure needed vaccines. Didn‚Äôt reaction besides sore arm finally went away today. Zoom virtual events! /s fighting virus, real vaccine induced, hydration always helps. know people work colleges right? Also masters students? Like everyone‚Äôs 20 lol  Shhhh...they know think want get people fence get vaccinated, I‚Äôd say proper way require lot general things vaccines required for. random person thinks vaccination big hassle isn‚Äôt worth effort would probably meant could go university, could work company, could receive kind monetary benefit. I‚Äôm mandating every last thing vaccine gets FDA approval, put place common places it‚Äôll probably catch stragglers. don‚Äôt wanna scan QR code get store without mask I‚Äôm fine stapling health forms school. No?

That 5% symptomatic COVID, vast majority cases extremely mild hospitalizations deaths rounding away 0%. possible non-forgeable method prove vaccination. then, easy someone lie end blowing covid everyone around them. Fox news imagine. Functionally, what‚Äôs difference? end result either way still ‚Äúhave‚Äù it. Yes! needs happen. lots people vaccines make large efforts get would get shot right next them. could list 5 6 right top head small circle. Must be, weirdness. Cuomo‚Äôs daily tweet said 26 deaths. could edit headline make millions instead lakh, would. sub allow headline modification  Who's talking requiring vaccines grocery shopping? Oh, wasn‚Äôt unusual feel thirsty Pfizer? Didn‚Äôt know Saturday Malaria eradicated United States. 24 hours second shot it‚Äôs gone better first time. Barely soreness all. New York add backlog deaths today? Hard agree. you‚Äôre eligible vaccine, chose get one, end ICU bills, don‚Äôt want pay higher premiums ass insurance group. 

To borrow phrase people love: *Pull bootstraps* pay multi-million dollar medical bill dumbass self. safety children cannot vaccinated big legitimate concern.

Good thing they're pretty safe virtue nature. **Apr. 28, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Going level logic understanding, make sense clauses mean two British plants *must not* used AZ initial doses. it? read ""EU plants *should* used"" ""preferably ones \[to fulfill order\]"", certainly using four plants already contract got massive shortfalls sounds like no-brainer regarding ""best efforts"". Afterall that's pretty much AZ went efforts towards UK. Considering Dutch made drug substance shipped example...

Regardless verdict, lawsuit good thing hopefully it'll clear things up. Yes 100% Yeah, that's big one, lots others too.

Like, maybe breakthrough cases happen often people good immune systems? also correlate COVID deadly?

Or breakthrough cases identified bad symptoms? Maybe missing mild asymptomatic cases, would make death rate seem higher.

And on, on. Eating disorders usually able control something control everything else. Lollapalooza I‚Äôm extremely anxious person whatever reason simple fact make feel better. see graph cases age group? Hard disagree here, think people medically able get vaccine ignorant get it, would fucked government willingly put people massive medical debt (which already pretty fucked even outside COVID, IMO).

Even without vaccination would risk 24 hours. flu new varients time, effective treatments yearly vaccines adapted new varient. exist covid. already seeing varient covid. viruses mutate change time continue copy themselves. restrictions buying time. Pfizer already working antiviral covid, new vaccines combat different varients already development. ready, run risk another massive outbreak would kill even people. 

Reaching heard immunity US paying attention varients found countries buy us time. Easing restrictions without enough people vaccinated come back bite us. seem worth risk close already. town people remove masks vaccination take photo. that's part procedure wonder people getting infected vaccine centers. don‚Äôt think vaccine works protect stay home. Quit trying impose others. Israel full lockdown something like 6 weeks ago. Driving cases hard right vaccination takes could greatly accelerate end. Also depending you‚Äôre moving you‚Äôre looking for, relatively laid back corporate culture fantastic.  parents went get vaccinated hospital staff remove masks take photo. think kind stupid procedures reason many vaccinated people getting infected.   need vaccination kids reason let everyone wants catch covid. doses would use save many lives countries.  went '04. Day burn man tuxedo handing cups (really good) gumbo. incredibly surreal amazing experience. 

Pro tip- bring lots fruit. People love cool crisp apple/slice melon/etc heat day- especially towards end. Oh no. Showing ID concert venue? mean like thing already events, whether check age check name name ticket? inconsolable. I'm pandemic ending declaring victory, pretty much ""mission accomplished"" again. Official Covid-19 cases India April first: 12.2 Million

Official Covid-19 cases India April 28th: 17.99 Million

To put perspective, first 3 months year, India 2 million Covid cases total. country nearly tripled number 28 days. even accounting unofficial cases may far higher. E484Q lineage detected much outside India, surely present. Vaccines appear still work based one lab test done one vaccine, would nice see B.1.617 actually get studied way B.1.1.7 been. I'm sure Europe accept that. We're trying get green pass system adopted countries well. Yeah, ICU numbers always lag fair bit. Give 2-3 weeks also start dropping. Using bad analogy worse using all. grasp idea? Wtf wrong YOU? death rate. busy get vaccine, able go match. Disgusting post locked due Xenophobia. go. masks 6 year olds get vaccinated jfc. yes then. ask mods put scientific credentials next user name, assuming epidemiologist? Thanks afaik, oxford researchers wanted make non-profit, convinced team bigger company better distribution (which ended AZ). 


either way, pandemic Definition wont end whole world able curb spread. worst case, end year west fully vaccinated new vaccine-resistant variant global south spread again. need WTO patent waiver see world there's wave among unvaccinated people fall contain summer. Maybe care, would nice kids choice avoid catching then. 

In better world though pandemic might already we're waiting testing catch up. already happened much country, rest can't far behind. That's give choice 100% effective severe diease made fucking pandemic first place. Covid essentially cold u like 1 10 chance catching. want stay home fear cold vaxxed person fine, tell others do. Covid never gonna eradicated btw, that's pure pipe dream transmissible many people refusing vaccines. people getting vaccinated = less restrictions.

Pretty simple idea. color day today gray. It‚Äôs black white. familiar it? Couldn‚Äôt said better Gross personally feel COVID 19 serious infection Spanish flu. consider supplemental oxygen vaccines compare death rate transmission rate COVID 19 realize COVID 19 happened time would killed upto 5 percent population. That‚Äôs true. 

However, resolving dispute, words matters. CEO say contract signed 3 months UK. not. 

It came answer was: ok wasn‚Äôt signed binding agreement before. 

I believe bunch ‚Äúmishaps‚Äù like communication behalf AZ private n√©gociations help EU takes court. 

The EU think shot. AZ think fine. see judge decide hopefully end it. wish moved Nevada. Used go camping there, showed BRD same.
Went 1996...big deal. variants we've studied kill people ages, kill elderly far more. deaths hear India still people 50s likely changed. hear young people getting infected dying almost certainly purely old people vaccinated. Brazil instance found CFR increased roughly 2x every unvaccinated age group P.1 started take over. 

But India idea many dying. virus could less deadly deadly across age groups, pattern age could changed completely. mutation there, E484Q, seen anywhere else nothing judge by. agree you, never change thinking close minded people. virus isn‚Äôt going anywhere lots doubters deniers get real sick it. OMG please let real Appropriately named.  Logic whole shit show ridiculous.


""Hey, usurped stockpiles vaccines allow get one yet, young healthy. hand require vaccinated allowed go somewhere would like go fitting punishment pandemic crime health youth""

And no, tests poor substitute. need repeated require planning. ""Hey mate, let's go cold one evening""... got vaccine. Showing proof every time leave house take time uncomfortable. It‚Äôs bit concerning can‚Äôt figure out, honestly. Also, low vaccination rate.  People die regardless lifting emergency order. That's key. provides literally 0 benefit point. realise significant portion patronage anti vaccination summary situation :

 chief minister Uttar Pradesh state India declared people spreading ""misinformation"" regarding oxygen punished. covers cases hospitals government private well individuals punished requesting O2. 


As example, youth sought Oxygen grandfather via tweet named [criminal case spreading rumor panic state, hospitals dire need O2 flourishing black market oxygen medicines like remdesivir. Almost hospitals state capital asking patients come arrangements O2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, admission hospital, long bureaucratic hurdles keep numbers low. goes tandem restricted testing. patients arranging Oxygen smaller cities 100s kilometers away approaching hospital bed.

&amp;#x200B;

While going on, [local body still running. conclude 29th April. elections elect representatives villages, lowest level governance India. Thousands villages voting, Corona moving smaller localities. Many voters earlier phase elections sick.

&amp;#x200B;

And, deaths. government hiding death figures innovative ways. Restricted testing limit positive cases, followed availability beds treatment, lack O2 causing lot deaths.

Deaths due comorbidities included even tested positive negative symptoms lead covid. result, factor 10 usually found actual cremations reported data. end, cremation number started appear, government started putting [barricades metal around cremation ground prevent onlookers camera.  difference obviously reciting something daily (the pledge) takes time every day, something done (a vaccine) not. Bit concerning can‚Äôt tell apart, honestly. You‚Äôre 100% wrong. Construction workers often indoors cramped spaces also riding 3-4 deep trucks cars going job.

You‚Äôre 200% wrong outbreak among kids playing outdoor sports - idea you‚Äôre getting folklore.

Outdoor transmission simply happen degree people needed walk around masks outside. There‚Äôs debate. problem people,

That's vaccines work. going problem everyone unable get vaccine, young get one (like literal babies) compromised immune systems. unvaccinated population also creates opportunity virus mutate. Worst case scenario manages become something vaccines useless against. something we're able come new vaccine quickly we'd basically starting zero again. Cases Oregon went 58% past two weeks, that‚Äôs probably why. It‚Äôll take weeks vaccines kick improve Agreed. whole state remain closed indefinitely since Tennessee never going reach 70% vaccination rate. Genius. called American varient remarkably low number, possibly 1 million times less virus concentration high number definitely contagious sample taken. there's way know means got infected rising, got infected long ago dropping, got breathed wrong person infected. 

I would guess consider negative. Safety vaccinated completely unconnected situation epidemic large. trials revealed environment, vaccines reduced symptomatic illness 90-95%, we're finding reduce asymptomatic illness transmission lot too, eventually vaccines end need restrictions. now, number cases effective transmission rate matter too. Unmasked, unrestricted vaccinated individuals would expected infected 90-95% less unmasked, unrestricted, unvaccinated individuals. much would be? know, data masked, restricted, unvaccinated individuals. judgment call would without restrictions, 90-95% less ok. 

For now, professionals saying even spread would high. now, main point vaccine protection death, hospitalization illness. 

You may disagree - somewhat disagree, think would okay lift restrictions vaccinated, although practical problems vaccine passports cheating might big enough easier wait, may well weeks situation restrictions needed anyone. can't base disagreement vaccine = safe, compare unmasked, unrestricted vaccinated risk hypothetical unmasked, unrestricted unvaccinated risk. current vaccines 90%-95% effective.

That means that, situation exposed Covid, someone vaccinated 5%-10% chance getting sick someone vaccinated. That's pretty good, zero.

When enough people vaccinated, Covid can't infect often enough maintain infection rate, disappears. point, *everyone's* chance infection 0%, one catch *from* -- way one U.S. gets Polio, even though Polio vaccines 100% protective either.

So much better vaccinated not, even better enough people around vaccinated virus can't hold get exposed first place. It‚Äôs also incredibly boring exciting attend Exactly. astounding many people babies.  Blind obedience law consistent democracy. Here's good starting point. 

There's difference rule law versus rule law. dunno I‚Äôd say morally superior [these types people. think I‚Äôm less jackass slightly self awareness. get vaccinated still get disease pass onto others?  Yup, that‚Äôs exactly it. It‚Äôs big choose adventure game people kind playing along chaos also creating. CDC tells get one. Trying hard Ah okay, good. second thought needed lobotomy.

Would love see science says vaccinated people need mask outdoors, ever. Peer-reviewed study, please!

For measure, would love see science says vaccinated people need mask indoors, ever. Peer-reviewed study, please!

Okay, requests peer-reviewed studies sound pretty biting sarcastic. are. seriously, would love see whatever study people looking says fully vaccinated people need keep masking. I'm asking ""Theoretically, possible vaccinated person get give Covid."" (The studies say extremely highly unlikely.) I'm asking actual numbers study vaccinated people supports continued mask mandates, occupancy limits, shutdowns, etc. ask sincerely, sarcastically. 300K nearly 400K cases per day back then. 70% high school graduates continue college, population likely correlates people already planned getting vaccine. absolutely inevitable. keep repeating vaccination viral spread continue ameliorate long term, fact seems fly head again. mean legal access vaccine? US resident/Citizen? Got 2nd Pfizer shot 12 hours ago little arm soreness first shot. *assuming* I'm fine long iunno. Maybe I'll feel work tomorrow morning so, I'm going home. Wish Bolsonaro would fined this... laws requires masks, use it. It‚Äôs not. dude idiot denial. Typical discussion thread. everyone got J&amp;J AZ vaccines, 90% preventing hospitalization. 10% population 250k‚Ä¶ Chicago‚Äôs healthcare system would run

This common mistake see vaccine efficacy rates though. 70% 90% JNJ refer reduction chance catching/hospitalization virus vs control group. 30% chance getting coronavirus. 70% less chance get vaccine. chance closer single digits hospitalization rates far highly dependent age health. Coronavirus transmittable Measles (thank god). anti-vax crowd honor system..... got it. Okay time right amazing vaccines. Concerts scheduled August getting moved. line thinking accurate isn‚Äôt. getting 2022 from? normal activities resumed, anyone wants vaccine get one, sports stadiums expanding crowds Concerts scheduled summer. none vaccines convey sterilizing immunity.

Do source this? impression still ongoing studies determine conveyed sterilizing immunity, I've heard they've explicitly stated *don't* provide it. Excerpt: ‚ÄúWe reviewed support CDC‚Äôs new masking recommendations working quickly align California‚Äôs guidance common sense updates,‚Äù Dr. Tom√°s Arag√≥n, director California Department Public Health, said statement tweet announcing news, Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded state managing lowest test positivity rate case rate entire country. Last week, Hawaii beat state holding lowest statistics. changed week Hawaii‚Äôs test positivity case rates inched upward recent days California‚Äôs continued Currently, state test positivity rate 1.2% 33 new daily cases per 100,000 people. comparison, total nationwide case rate 116.4 cases per 100,000, according U.S. Centers Disease Control Los Angeles County also update guidelines align new state federal rules allowing vaccinated residents go mask-free outdoor settings. county joined federal health officials still recommending facial coverings keeping six feet apart Health officials also warned people unvaccinated start wear masks, could put rest population risk. 50% county yet fully inoculated, officials said. Yes, this.

The science NEVER said anything outdoor spread extremely highly unlikely. Dude, relax. soon. part don‚Äôt one ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù assholes. Well, never going get 100% compliance rate unless live dystopian government like North Korea, do? Pretty sure that's a) going happen b) adults required vaccinated. ridiculous mindset death everything's fine. Outdoor masking requirements could've rescinded literally months ago, majority highest risk people already vaccinated cases already cratered. Arguably could've removed far earlier even too, since we've known quite time outdoor transmission rare. even full removal either, left part ""big crowd"". really feels like pretty limp-dicked half-measure.

This downvoting! least, that's I'm downvoting. bot...which something bot would totally say. Jesus, neither understand vaccine efficacy society, ü•¥. Me, young Canadian: Roadtrip!!!! agree. need make mandatory least hard live normal life unvaccinated. Let people refuse vaccine ones restricted activity instead responsible people got them. ""cheering virus""? No. Concerts completely different beast grocery shopping know that. frequent member back then, too. guesses sometime May end summer. certain points, vaccination wasn‚Äôt expected available general pop (in US) least autumn. 

I‚Äôm fairly sure parts US also close normal, exception medium/large events (and even starting trickle back in). understand travel certain countries already requires certain vaccinations, right? Particularly places Central South America, others. 

If Canada wants require US citizens prove vax going country, doesn‚Äôt violate freedom. Canadian government never granted freedom. Get shot stay home.  chances kid die severe effect vaccine orders magnitude lower covid. Let vaccinate ban selfish fucks won‚Äôt vaccinate flying. Either way, let travel worry it, stupid idiot. possible variant may work explain 2 breakthrough infections. sure state epi team investigate this. interesting learn virus sequencing infection pathway. kind outbreaks give us lot info spread investigated well.  one. goes certain group's narrative, they'll pretend table. 

It's slippery slope logic. That‚Äôs said, everybody going get vaccine gotten opportunity get point. universe everybody ever going vaccinated.  guess depends mean ""normal"" talk to.  sorry hear that. Pfizer Moderna? first week horrible too. Second week bit better. week rough headaches really loud ear ringing right ear (was ears last night = left ear normal again.) 

A new symptom creeped last weekend‚Äîby 7 pmish every night barely keep eyes open (and I‚Äôm late night person.) sucks. also force mundane chores like laundry, load dishwasher, vacuum. seems take energy right get vacuum, unwind cord, plug in, run across floor.

Since last couple days starting hear news deaths. People scared now. worried parents. Atleast, got first dose Astrazeneca vaccine.


I also hearing lot cases people gotten even getting vaccine, however seem people tend get midler symptoms. Well, COVID over.

I'm fully vaccinated wear mask whenever I'm settings people wear mask. What's big deal?  asking decidedly non expert commenters predict end pandemic? Kumbamela? year. Less 200 kids died covid that's numerous states schools open year. Covid real threat children. true probably able reach 10million/day rate past polio, still would sight better without government actively trying hamper Covid efforts. look US: first, government actively downplayed pandemic practically everything could ignore, government replaced competent one took pandemic seriously, US Covid response went joke model success. course, Brazil US, goes show much difference competent government would make. India Covishield/AstraZeneca Covaxin, similar J&amp;J Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V. made using old, tried-and-true method using ‚Äúdead‚Äù flu virus deliver covid protein fragments stimulate immune response human body.


These vaccines around chance preventing ‚Äúgetting‚Äù Covid-19. However, government advertising 90% chance preventing ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù serious symptoms require hospitalization.


This say Pfizer/Moderna mRNA vaccines decidedly better. mRNA unproven technology. believe first time ever it‚Äôs used real world setting?

I doctor. medical advice. personally got Pfizer vaccine. still flinch little bit seeing TV shows movies people crowded room without mask on. going take time unwind thing. need half population fully vaccinated data Israel shows Lol what? Bay Area? People Berkeley Haight LARP homeless people everyday.   would still reach 60% vaccinated early August

You mean fully vaccinated right? wear mask go out. I've gotten together meals vaccinated friends, played music indoors, etc. I'll happy theaters restaurants music venues reopen, think perfectly reasonable yet. Walk ins accepted many areas Oregon atm drive.  get yellow fever vaccine visit Kenya, crazy. gonna make Dolly Parton sad :( He‚Äôs asking cases. He‚Äôs asking hospitalization rates among demographics, still inconsequential number since proven year now, people age 40 risk seasonal influenza strains Covid. 18, risk hospitalization practically zero, gives shot cases vast vast majority asymptomatic extremely mild. Everyone going vaccinated September. People option vaccinated September. thing all. would ""general consensus"" bunch Redditors weight value? virus decides. it‚Äôs fucking dumb ‚ÄúpRoTeCt‚Äù people don‚Äôt want vaccine lmao

That works kids get vaccine. People keep spewing ‚Äúanyone wants get it,‚Äù lie. current pace, kids lucky get next year bullshit, enough research know liklihood vaccine magically affects 2-12 new side affect near zero.

Either open vaccine kids, actually say, ‚Äúeveryone wants one get one‚Äù mandate verifiable vaccine passports keep lockdowns.

I prefer 1 2 3, think we‚Äôre headed 3 politicians don‚Äôt want offend delicate sensibilities anti-vax nuts. people Miami spring break lol I'll say like elsewhere:

If one business starts it, would others not? case count leading indicator, trailing one. Incubation times, spread rates, etc... High risk PREVENT hospital bring full. full. True. meanwhile (month half) indoor (and outdoor) spaces larger capacity. Yes people's choice, that's choice lot people going make. That's problem. event organizer deal reality, reality going lot unvaccinated people coming event. here's Fauci confirming Vaccine India developed works well B.1.617. safe assume vaccines It‚Äôs certainly impossible they‚Äôd develop vaccine, basic process well known, that‚Äôs different effective safe.

I also wouldn‚Äôt shocked whitelabeled Sputnik though honest. sure that's why? article state reason I've seen among acquaintances go Burning man, burner crowd usually consists wealthy tech bros open vaccines. current president real data I'm pretty sure much spread, there's data reason suggest otherwise current vaccines still decently effective Even without Bolsonaro huge difference vaccinations, maybe could've shortened distance Chile, nearly, nearly enough country 12x residents. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

2. Grocery stores mass gatherings. Idk getting downvoted lol. sure hell want tourists country I'm still sitting home unvaccinated. That's nyc spring 2020.

You also clearly read infield seating. Mask-wearing temperature checks required. Bronze silver badge access require proof vaccination daily. Concerts canceled.

There's still safety measures place. trust doctor? could ask them.   Yeah thanks. travelling aged population barely even vaccinated - doubt us second dose summer. It'd ridiculous let US travellers sit home - unvaccinated.

Good US prioritizing vaccination schedule, throughout pandemic actions targeting Canadian medical needs we've helped multiple crises phony wars stings (not mention literally supply vast majority pulp products needed medical grade masks gowns) wrong. want two weeks second shot. 

Places gonna verify vaxxed not, still require mask, whatever. personally, places longer require masks (like gym), I'm done mask soon two-week mark hits. don‚Äôt know efforts reach parts state

Louisiana started vaccine program focus including pharmacies distribution program. one first states fair amount federal pharmacy program based state did. surprisingly good, even Cocodrie vaccine providers within 20 miles. Yeah, that's exactly point. clinical trial. already done. also government vaccinating, government anything creating vaccines shooting money cannon it.

If take shallow read everything never going trust anything. That'd like saying go college one time Kent State national guard murdered kids Jewish people never go Germany looks like anti-vaxxers prevent us normal end 2021, everyone preparing. Kinda ironic.   vaccination? local preacher mean facebook algorithms. wrong thinking two weeks fully vaccinated mostly safe, gather groups, go restaurants, theoretically shouldn‚Äôt wear mask etc? keep hearing professionals talking still can‚Äôt anything vaccine. point then? necessary outbid, countries managed procure share supplies without outbid major economies. problem Brazil leadership (mostly Bolsonaro) strongly anti-vax, much push top make vaccine procurement priority. Cars wear seatbelt. wear seatbelt ""live life"" start driving road you? still take precautions. 

With flu people healthy survive. seem immune compromised like went chemo probably take precautions. course there's flu vaccine every year.

Any whataboutisms want talk about? manage help people schedule appointments, people don‚Äôt care bother though. wonder many people scared shots lol sending military? thought point patients get better...

/s don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs argument. Tuskegee experiments others like instilled, particularly communities color US, deep mistrust medical research institution particularly combination government. part reason people color underrepresented clinical research. bring ‚Äúnew‚Äù vaccine government telling take there‚Äôs justified wariness. Crazy stuff Great point! Vast swaths US near complete normal even restricted areas much open last year. Vaccines natural immunity helping us much, look NYC year compared last.  - they've already said appears vaccine needed taken yearly

- fauci others said winter vulnerable time covid, expect even w restrictions open fall level regression back winter nationally

- definition ""over""? still doubt getting sold games, concerts, masks October. Perhaps February March officially ""done"" masks. fair located? Pennsylvania, one Grange Fair saw say make comeback next year. festival people nude shit?  mindset flu? Less deaths per year lot people still die. car accidents? Eventually need live lives. What‚Äôs point vaccine can‚Äôt? like rules sake rules.  According data released government, 4 10k people got infected 2 doses vaccines. none cases serious required hospitalization. really trying tell could outbid countries mentioned? Cmon man family Tennessee declared COVID least six months ago. got without catching (yet) shocking. catch it, never got tested, never posted social media, lucky worse. That'd old American spirit, quit things get hard. 

Only 700 deaths day, big deal. Procurement said materials and/or products part supply, politics influences that. practically push procuring vaccines anti-vaxxer Bolsonaro charge. Sadly I‚Äôm state decreasing first dose uptake month last week first week rejected part allocation doses (85%). India's leader pretty much like Trump acting. held huge rallies elections coming wear mask purpose claiming government defeated covid think even promising thing time last year huge chunk country either still stay home order coming them. Sure, mask usage higher now, activities shit. every day, people immunity.

This thing cooked, US anyway. I‚Äôll bet crack up! science doesn‚Äôt work may reason different way. There‚Äôs joke I‚Äôve heard maybe try telling ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve ever gone number 2 public restroom, you‚Äôre type person needs worry what‚Äôs vaccine.‚Äù point I‚Äôm willing take risk people continuing nothing stay home detrimental ways. early say. Yes, that‚Äôs basically it. Since beginning, clear developed countries would get pandemic way sooner poorer countries. 

When USA finish vaccinations, see huge supply finally going rest world... likely CDC updated charts reflect new major change guidance since announced morning. air-ebola, types would ever understand

There simply words capture disappointing reality states. really classify concerts ""domestic day-to-day life""? Thinking mad I‚Äôve gotten one specific coworker ALWAYS came work sick. It‚Äôs like girl go hell home! cure like would amazing.  That‚Äôs actually correct. J&amp;J AZ adenovirus vector vaccines. It‚Äôs another new technology ‚Äútried true‚Äù. used modified chimpanzee virus enter cells something Covid spike protein immune response. still excellent vaccines, entirely different technology. none vaccines convey sterilizing immunity. person responded, mine hit eight days first dose lasted least week fading. 

My arm seems hanging onto discoloration dear life, aside. 

I second dose later today... fingers crossed mild side effects!  fools family easily parted see doctor.

For worth J&amp;J pretty instantly uncomfortable too. Arm sore week slight injection site reaction light bruising, gone within couple days. still get it. Getting vaccine resuming life like pre covid stupid. covid spreads via people, gathering incredible invasion privacy anywhere, allowed normal economies, saved countless small businesses, knows many lives.

I'm one ""I make personal sacrifice, even means gain many"" - whilst also live anxiety relatives, lose access clubs entertainment (with closures inevitably permanent) - seems lose/lose me. lose personally, society/everyone else to.

Where pay-off smaller though, due covid thing anyway? Yeah, agree. worth it. Ah, yeah, see that. I‚Äôve talking organizers they‚Äôre much less optimistic. We‚Äôll see, though. live india sorry acting rude u dumb....half billion means every 1 2 people infected tbh since lockdown city even heard positive case area ....so please dont beleive bs...the cases might underreported HALF BILLION ??....bruhhh taking away freedom. done MONTHS ago instead still virtually place we're January. Shits horrible I‚Äôm still waiting surge DFW metroplex eeeevil Texas Rangers. Never came THAT'S public messaging.

I con planned last weekend August Atlantic City; hopefully things even better mask mandate relaxed.  Parents grandparents got vaccinated buddy. They‚Äôre gonna fine. dude, evidence outdoor activities contributing substantial way spread covid. That's we're talking thread isn‚Äôt type vaccines. It‚Äôs number. India 1.3 billion people, nowhere near number vaccines needed. people would lie getting vaccine large anti-mask, anti-lockdowns, etc. already disregard restrictions, matter. stupid talking point know keeps getting repeated.

Even people successfully lie vaccination would've following restrictions otherwise, matter everyone else around already gotten vaccinated? We're yet, another month two be. everybody thinks that. Worth noting true. AZ, Sputnik J&amp;J viral vector vaccines. actually also relatively novel ways vaccination, first type approved was, J&amp;J Ebola vaccine July 2020! I‚Äôd guess goes way explaining people didn‚Äôt realise J&amp;J AZ production issues - new tech well seems particularly difficult scale first times around.

Roughly speaking mRNA vaccines use mRNA instruct cells produce covid spike proteins body immune response to. Viral vectors use different, harmless virus vector get DNA body, goal producing spike proteins. way ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù similar.

The good news data U.K. shown one dose, Pfizer AZ vaccine show similar real-world results terms effectiveness. dosing strategy U.K. means remains seen effectiveness compared doses, however, strategy worked well majority protection afforded first dose.

Examples inactivated virus types China‚Äôs Sinopharm Sinovac. There‚Äôs also yet approved Inactivated, Adjuvanted Valneva vaccine. I'm honestly curious cannot think remote towns myself. far top head using Google maps.

- Jena 10 vaccine sites within 20 mi, 7 within 2 mi. 
- Mink 32 vaccine sites within 20 mi, 12 within 10 mi.
- Grant 10 vaccine sites within 20 mi, 1 site within 10 mi.
- Mittie 13 vaccine sites within 20 mi, none within 10 mi. Wait variants mutations start hitting like India.

It's dumb. give Saturday Washington county follows suit mysteriously cases popped 200 threshold. Yeah

I feel like measures restrictions going several weeks gone date slated held August/September organizers kicking jumping gun.

No, stipulation Oxford AZ offered vaccine non profit. banning exports like EU US

Saying EU banning exports like misleading. Yes, EU technically blocked exports, one specific vaccine one specific company hugely behind schedule domestic deliveries. Exports poor countries (COVAX) exports vaccines completely exempt well.

EU exported 100M doses, even including doses sent COVAX, Israel countries. EU second China comes exports, saying ""EU banning exports"" without clarifying Unlike EU US, UK vaccine manufacturing capability pandemic, built AZ factories specifically pandemic, stipulated contract serve UK first, that's common sense directly paying factories scratch, see reasonable person could argue that.

Sure might low levels, especially areas vaccines accepted. it‚Äôll always around.

Which there‚Äôs way wait herd immunity get things back normal. can‚Äôt wait long sure. I'm saying Chinese government competent enough hide 40% population infected COVID. Indian government competent effective. Including entire inactivated virus vaccine provides many epitopes, targets antibodies, cells, B cells making prefusion spike. vaccine could possibly used booster US future, mRNA reactogenicity remains issue, broader protection required. like idea find good way implement it. example, antivax country, Simovac available it‚Äôs approved Canada. would happy take pfizer/JJ/AZ can‚Äôt. feel would super unfair hundred thousand people poorer countries don‚Äôt access vaccines. not?

There‚Äôs already precedent requiring vaccines society, even diseases essentially killed out. It‚Äôs unreasonable think COVID could follow path. don‚Äôt like that, tough. Home schooled kids often extremely poorly adjusted so... Yes, 1/3 tests returning positive. people get tested symptoms. Others (like me, live Delhi way) trying avoid unnecessary contact people, including test collection agents. 

Hospital beds people dying line see doctor mean 40% Indians infected. means India's healthcare infrastructure inadequate. India 1.34 doctors per 1000 people 2017. US 2.9 doctors per 1000 people. UK 2.5. OECD countries 3.5. India doctors, healthcare infrastructure completely overwhelmed.

India China. Yes, government pretty high propaganda, even able hide numbers 40% Indians infected Covid. get memo?

BJP said latest outbreak nothing rallys religious festivals... Correct. detriment many many others. focus one see one.  mix likely given better protection 2 jabs type. First dose trying say vaccinated people like drunk drivers, people willingly choose get vaccinated, innocent people hit car?

Stop anti vaxxer. ""after first dose"" Since ruling prime minister India ignored Covid-19 measures pulled game like Trump Bolsonaro, see share vaccines India. Would better situation get control loses support step since facist. Maybe Indian finally stand now? Gotta love anti-science drivel doubles nationalistic propaganda that, people toute ""low fatality rate"", asked, would say 9/11 tragedy. 1% nearly major country's population 9/11 every single day.

Don't accept premise question. Explain many people 1% is, hospitals equipped treat even 10% population, overwhelming creates death spiral. Doesn‚Äôt assume 100% infection prevention? Almost everyone around place skeptical vaccine first everyone wants it. sad thing stock everywhere.

Totally agree seems large subset population completely forgotten this.  Preventing healthcare system collapse, collateral damage accompanies it, always primary goal efforts. Protecting vulnerable population (65+ comorbidities like obesity, CVD, diabetes) always secondary goal (and one supports primary goal). Eliminating transmission virus never goal, never goal, wholly unrealistic unattainable. 

We track 65-70% 16+ population vaccinated end May, combine % population natural immunity prior infection, likely 85-90% vaccination rate vulnerable population then, fact Covid serious problem &lt;16 year olds, almost certainly ""good enough"" re-open point. course, continue expand vaccination efforts beyond at-risk continue take precautions. that's different keeping things shut there's still low level background transmission we're theoretical threshold herd immunity small children yet vaccinated. Slang. Uncommon Covid-19. 

""Vaccinated"" long word, Americans love shorten words. Everyone know getting fully completely back lives soon become vaccinated. Travel, dinners, hugs, house guests, etc. places require masks enter unavoidable besides gung ho.

I also see cautious, conflicting, complicated, contradictory statements can't even vaccinated. ample evidence studies including CDC vaccinated protects prevents spreading it. whatever reason ""officials"" can't embrace say anything would cause people let restrictions. say ""abundance caution"" say ""oblivious toxic effects lockdowns"". YMMV. yet intend hold massive religious pilgrimage cost many lives. populated places especially rely mass transit, mask already case need go indoors. NYC checking in. Outdoor masking still thing here.

Key takeaway Pfizer performs significantly better AZ. Colour surprised one mean, true.

Lot thing there, first less 2 weeks since 10% vaccinated. Second 40% vaccinated would already counted first 40%. 49%. 

Not mention incidence vaccination vary lot age groups. point everyone wants vax, access it

This true. Taking Seattle example, surplus open appointments become available last 2 days, appointments future. Moderna 6 weeks first shot fully vaccinated.

it's likely actual drop people infected quite sharp recent case count. Right compare population, Ontario population 14.5 million, 100k day something like 0.7% population day. U.S stays 1.5mil, that's 0.45% population. 

Generally, much less appetite the... Ramifications opening much United States, we'll soon match first dose percentage Canada (probably 2 weeks), think we'll loosening restrictions. get wrong, think we'll roll back soon, open states - like it'll live sports, even numbers better U.S. Technically, researchers don‚Äôt know extent vaccinated people spread virus, all. there‚Äôs evidence vaccinated people don‚Äôt transmit much virus doesn‚Äôt anything death count. It‚Äôs combination society able live restrictions, public acceptance risk. deaths go public perceives less risk illness/death, social ending draws nearer regardless health officials recommend. isn‚Äôt fear mongering saying everything needs locked avoid this

Yes is. saying there's unknown higher chance mutation things locked number lower good happens without quantification much risk we're talking. Without benefit analysis pros cons side options between. Real math modelling based rate mutation per infected individual likelihood variant escapes vaccines would necessary that's seen anywhere. (BTW, spread mutation animal population also factor here).

Without comes fearmongering. Without know see horrible pandemic causing mutations flu every decades even though that's endemic virus regular yearly outbreaks across world large animal reservoir. coronaviruses mutate slowly flu. us atheism religion, 49% Americans identify member religion... going get lower Isn‚Äôt exactly you‚Äôre suggesting? people picked 70% estimate, vary geographic location. Weather, density, social activity, etc. make virus more/less transmittable. Maybe warnings hold little longer worked people remained cautious wouldn‚Äôt have? We‚Äôll never know it‚Äôs also plausible theory. 

Check Michigan‚Äôs peaks - spring case count actually rival winter peak. so?

These kind policies effect swine flu pandemic, Hong Kong flu pandemic. sure site get past automod, found article helpful easy guess depends counts SoCal. live desert East LA, routinely see weathers 121. What‚Äôs confusion? They‚Äôre part guidelines. 80% study, assuming Danish study that's commonly referenced, based PCR tests. means actually measure antibodies quite likely reinfected either never built proper antibodies decreased great extent. argument supported fact older age groups saw reinfection, since generally produce weaker antibody response less t-cells decrease observable antibodies likely actually decrease infection.


I'm saying 100% think 80% figure accurate reflection often measurable levels antibodies become infected wonder insurance requirement big factor cancellations seems like lot venues states would dying revenue. 2nd Moderna last week.

The next morning felt like coming something bed covers sensitive touch. Nothing paracetamol sort though could forced work wanted to.

By evening (And paracetamols later) bars drinking absolutely fine. You‚Äôre vaccinated. You‚Äôre two weeks in. feel safe.  bit crude, hey, works. Exposed COVID like  loved one lives someone tested positive COVID-19 last year. young developed loss smell days never tested. getting vaccinated believes already antibodies virus believe risk (however small) worth unnecessary. anyone link science based information shows vaccination necessary people natural immunity (assuming actually even natural immunity). Secondly way average person tested see sufficient immunity (whether naturally occurring vaccine). Thanks! Make sure cook eggs way. CDC recommend eating sunny side eggs. remind daily result India pinned US short 5 months ago. Point making sure AstraZeneca delivers vaccines EU. Doses desperately needed AstraZeneca seems manage deliver doses elsewhere, week EU - 0 doses. Next time mention tax rates Sweden hahaha average person informed general person /r/Coronavirus, think great! Green right great visual cue. Yes, masking probably overkill activities, we're moving right direction expect guidance continue loosen. TL;DR - Get vaccine wear mask indoors around people don‚Äôt know. guidelines back inside office day non vaccinated people? 

Simple answer.

It going *more one year*. shocking many Facebook commenters personally know ""several people"" hospitalized died COVID vaccines. absolutely clue. 

No matter way spin it, hanging multi million pound, completely domestic, industry dry lack clear communication financial support bad governance. 

Events either need reaffirmation restrictions allow proceed government needs negotiate figure X% potential revenue festivals would happy receive underwrite events. 

As right now, festivals started building sets, stages, signing contracts, conversely told stop prepping events cancel. bad news everyone. one got virtual climate summit Biden spent whole time, alone room, wearing mask world leader wore one alone room. struggling too. I'm small gathering everyone vaccinated child, still need wear mask? fantastic news! Well done England. point lawsuit? refund? Seems like EU pretty desperate doses today favorite been, ""covid big deal fever lost sense smell week, also virus biological weapon created Chinese lab harm Americans""

which randy? Ah sorry, forgot statisticians barred using social media. could course look risk learning new things, eh? health authorities area approved vaccine use age group, would take it. Basically, vaccine available (would must post) would hesitate take it. Good luck!  won‚Äôt catch dead indoors another mask less person unless I‚Äôve seen card...also fuck assholes making counterfeit vaccination cards. abundance caution course!

/s thought COVAX shots Chadox1? Science tells virtually impossible people fully vaccinated catch transmit virus. one million fully vaccinated catches virus, symptoms mild. think long overdue fully vaccinated people get lives. look like it. people already breaking covid restrictions. variants today trials conducted.

After years international travel opens back up, eventually foreign variants dominate, also new vaccines Science cool! makes good bad policy decisions. polarized state, lot people lose sight nuance. Fauci seems pretty hesitant declare anything safe unless it‚Äôs safe everyone. 

I‚Äôd hope months, he‚Äôd tell parents underage kids keep home, letting adults regain semblance normality. 

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna though. think he‚Äôs gonna tell everyone public health measures kids shots arms. Fluids. Drink ton water (and try eat consistent meals too, even hungry.) start subside 24 hours less. thought last night, track vaccinated vs non-vaccinated cases directly. example look worldometer see 52,046 cases US yesterday. separated something like 51,846 non-vaccinated cases 200 cases vaccinated people might help highlight well vaccines doing. made numbers, know something like 7000 breakthrough cases total, finding good source many occur per day.  


Other stats would powerful, 885 deaths US yesterday. think days would 0 deaths fully vaccinated people. trackers specifically listed non-vaccinated deaths would motivate people get vaccine? never driving would much safer! never drive again. anyone ever wearing mask outdoors household? That's way knowledge level, know influenza mutates much faster covid. speculation would flu vaccine usually imprecise match whatever strain actually appears.

It possible new mRNA vaccines could developed faster, therefore accurate match influenza virus. is, forecast strains circulation six months ahead shots delivered, often get wrong. Brazil. could let cases explode way? much needless loss life potent

Yea dare third world countries meet expectations. Bunch numskis right? gotta find prothean cache Mars good go!  herd immunity scale, on/off switch. states accumulated cases sheltered away. virus going get people regardless. decided prolong inevitable. suggest don't? problem Bolsonaro refused make vaccine deals last year invest development national vaccine. Probably enough vaccine give 10 million shots/day, could much better right now. could already vaccinate priority groups Brazil (estimated 77 million people), scheduled happen September. I'm counting since every week delays lower estimated delivery local production. country 2,500-3,000 deaths/day, many could avoided decent management. Instead still social distancing, staying home, masks... proof vaccination (like vaccine cards US) reliable proof vaccination times, hope situations need (like overseas travel) sort testing process prove get vaccination one can't prove status via vaccine passport. sure Europe going they're supposed allow tourists US near future vaccinated.

Could tests used determine antibody status trials also used purpose? enough difference natural infection vs vaccination able pick this? one vaccinated gotten infected before? able skip quarantine would nice.

I've asked elsewhere travel bigger possibility feel like posing question again. Right?! point it‚Äôs funny ignorant people be. message everywhere harmful UV rays are. Sigh. completely vaccinated, living someone who's high-risk, then, yes, sounds overly cautious.

Still, person like that, even Covid-19 CDC, she'd scared death shark attacks, lightning, Ebola, something. People like gonna fret without CDC, see point demonizing CDC. argue, want discuss see much twitter people getting mad healthy Americans want wait vaccine want it. believe vaccine effective keep safe getting covid, care people hate getting it? able spread loved ones risk vaccine, cares get sick want get shot?!&lt; 'More death' could mean anywhere extra tens deaths day hundreds. One fine, not. Luckily vaccinated vulnerable population favour former. It‚Äôs perfectly okay that. I‚Äôm that. Speeding law get caught get fined. multiple times, risk losing license. that's line mandates legal restrictions around covid better comparison.

I know get numbers speeders though. lot people cautious rule followers driving. speak truth. many Americans drug feet vaccination drive big events already gunshy due 2019/2020 events jostled looking events 2021 2022 wondering worth effort.

Line up, roll sleeves, bite lip, get shots. horrible wear mask.

Try wearing mask 9 hours supermarket cashier, 5 year old kindergarten, construction worker outside 90 degree heat get back us that. So... Let them, choice responsibility point Absorb nutrients osmosis. cool protists it. Poor child person gave someone COVID kills total nightmare fuel big part careful am. I'd never get guilt.

I sorry happened friend. friend's daughter, think could work coworker anymore. yet we're still lifting IP restrictions getting vaccine manufacturing going around world. Many countries predicted vaccinating 2024. That's fucking global south, that's allowing time variants spread, including back rich countries. Ok NPC would love hear source info people protection ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people. I‚Äôm saying trying punk (as people often do) - I‚Äôm genuinely curious! 

I also feel certain point, additional concerns vaccination continue take precautions wearing mask, mandates everyone end. don‚Äôt think quite point, getting close it. Particularly point everyone wants vaccine able get one. world duty help india humanitarian reasons, don‚Äôt know train heading point mention 'severe risks', that's something added.  Infants toddlers wearing masks all, pose real choking strangulation hazard. forget, promised masks, restrictions get 10,000 cases day. True. Even knew first wave last March-April, hard get tested. second Pfizer dose, nothing sore arm first 12 hours - couldn‚Äôt sleep side use arm pick cat.

Then fever, chills, aches, headache came, Honestly felt like crap, gone away next morning - although fatigue stuck around couple days.

Not experience particularly want repeat, it‚Äôs better worry getting covid. He‚Äôs right, looking tennesse graphs it‚Äôs bad.. mass testing, California close point false positives likely actual infections. latest positivity rate CA 1.2%, close overall false positive rate tests. test 100,000 people definitely covid get approximately numbers positive tests currently seeing California.

Eventually they'll need reclassify exactly infection is. They'll go either screening test + confirmation test = 1 infection, symptoms + positive test = 1 infection.

1 positive test = 1 infection good data positivity rate low. Also ""getting virus"" equal. vast majority people get virus vaccinated present symptoms mild symptoms. 

I got vaccine. However, many people gonna go ""what's point?"" get one nothing changes get vaccinated. household 3 moderna vaxxers 2/3 symptoms. Mine worse flu I've ever had, within 12 hours. Eating big meals really helped isn‚Äôt making headlines... lot bars NY ""only beer"" menus. Like, would quarter french fry something like that. Cite? people want everyone get vaccinated did. don‚Äôt really care got vax everyone get it, even herd immunity reached! Ridiculous.

EDIT: word still get covid vaccinated. drink *at all* woman could potentially get pregnant. 

The CDC organization basically take firm conservative stance matters health safety.  Virtually one actually following guidance. Vaccines work. agree implying people get second shot. absolutely increases effectiveness duration vaccine's protection.

The point though, CNN completely disingenuous saying ""only 25% state's residents vaccinated"". far higher percentage protection sickness transmission vector due single shot percentage eligible population gotten shot far higher that. Hydrate! found started feel bad, chugging water helped. Gatorade would probably help more, plan far ahead. :) 50-65M month may keep seeing ""do wear sunscreen"" arguement lately really understand yes, do, lol. People understand popular skin cancer is.  terribly? wrote CA much restrictive better vax rollout last week they're better. they're gonna shut businesses restrict people's freedom they're gonna need much much better results states didnt show way things lot factories worldwide sitting idle waiting supplies lifting IP. tells singing indoor chorus, singing indoor verse?  people ever continue quote?

You think anti-maskers understand nuance context? CDC messaging key. Well think number inaccurate always share link sources prove wrong. even send source facebook, decide whether reasonable (I'm much generalisations myself). parents 60 neither reaction aside arm soreness, first second shots (Pfizer). I've read vaccine acceptance growing stronger. Day second dose Moderna completely leveled. Chills, fatigue, muscle ache/weakness  Yeah exactly. CDC falling job push vaccines. people fence get them, CDC still pushing doom. need change messaging safe normal life achieved vaccination. They‚Äôre absolutely terrible job. data, showing ‚Äúthe impending doom‚Äù made jump media scaring everyone. numbers falling, doom never came be, vaccines indeed working‚Ä¶ found praise hopeful views? power government feels borderline dangerous. I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist there‚Äôs never hopeful views. Ah gotcha. Well live deep south USA blame still staying in. Personally husband still living like pre-covid. outdoor activities still eat out. Wear mask everywhere. know us assume many others least region. still playing safer side many others careless. know that's quite true. fortunate vaccines developed rolled quickly. definitely (and maybe still is) possibility variants evolving resistant vaccines. also worth remembering countries seeing light end tunnel right now. India, Brazil large countries still seeing big case numbers. doesn‚Äôt matter vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt matter people do. information effectiveness Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J vaccines 617 variant? Dude one mercy, indoor public spaces wear mask, outdoor public spaces tend run around coughing directly people's mouths valley notorious bad weather well terms heat. CDC always coming pointless shit. Fully vaccinated people shouldn‚Äôt wear mask anymore. No. Vaccine hesitant people vaccine hesitant people. shouldn‚Äôt create policy ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù something doing. Horrible precedent. CDC continue take baby steps data new, always fully proven virus thrown many curveballs. get back maskless normal society undoubtedly safe so.  little hard think yourself? study based U.K. data second dose delayed rather given 3 weeks. Studies show efficacy BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine declines 95% 91% six months, said.

Do similar data vaccines (Moderna, Oxford/AZ, J&amp;J, Sputnik V, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Covaxin, etc)? 

How long efficacy last / slowly efficacy degrade important factor peak efficacy imo.

Also much lower rates around odds getting hit lightning. don‚Äôt live absolutes. must understand odds likelihoods engage productive conversation policy all. speeding? easily affect others get accident I'm willing bet close 100% drivers speed regularly. shame large number people can't quite get ""until almost everyone vaccinated, still need vigilant preventing every infection can"" Y‚Äôall seem sleeping fact CDC says vaccinated people longer need physically distance.

I'm going play game though.  Dude im gonna even waste energy link many articles stating incredibly wrong are. didnt thing goating angry reacts. said handling fifteen cases people died France vaccinated AstraZeneca, vast majority aged ""under 60 years"".

Surely random deaths post vaccine related VTT otherwise Jesus Christ could easily go opposite way, since mass infection occurred cities (for part) rural areas, vaccine hesitancy. hold mask open slightly, sprinkle little food crumbles inside catch tongue.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted think said true millions people. personally get point need vaccinated reduce transmission, end pandemic, etc., many focus impacts them, chart basically shows doesn't. 

I'm still wearing mask everywhere indoors despite vaccinated, even required. point June, everyone wants vaccinated opportunity mask wearing protect people want vaccinated going make sense.

The impediment finger-waving, nanny state messaging: ""Don't think go back normal got vaccinated! Make long term friends mask!"" Put garbage six feet belongs watch wonderful things happen uptake among vaccine-hesitant, especially younger people.

If put ""your vaccine lets go 100% back normal"" table there's still high hesitancy, then, *only* then, would get upset people want get vaccinated. clearly lived long enough understand I'm talking about. Everyone naive idea everyone comes good righteous kind make good decisions benefit all. truth almost never this. can't take seriously either. we're impasse. Exactly lmao. lot people don‚Äôt want go work person option. everyone able get vaccine yet. also live France. rules make absolutely sense me. live city allowed travel 10km outside it, shops museums etc closed curfew. means blocked city tight time frame people complaining seeing many people outside. Like go?? Literally where.  deal little craziness weeks, means people happy Watching show choir competition masks trip. unvaccinated people can‚Äôt vaccinated! job Rural MO basically one wore mask anywhere. job site boss people wearing mask even though inside people country. 

Stores restaurants signs saying ‚Äúmasks mandatory‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enforced. best employees would masks though usually around chin. 

One guy asked still wore mask went he‚Äôs scared COVID never wore mask never stopped seeing grandkids. 

My boss mentioned he‚Äôs friends die COVID guy responded ‚Äúme too‚Äù. Wtf  Dude.. No. Mask mandate required thing left everyone wants vaccine gotten one masks restrictions gotta go. Nothing else makes sense. never get better scenario. sucks that's reality there's use denying it. 

I seriously doubt government going forcibly mandate vaccine that's possible scenario things get better full voluntary vaccination. messaging US made parents think kid life long complications might die get it, unfortunately don‚Äôt talk ü§´ Yeah would get tested either around infected person, symptoms?

Could vaccine distributed equitably worldwide? Absolutely. poorer countries gain access vaccine following richer countries vaccinating population? Also yes. countries vaccinating population. Like many things (remember temperature thing became non-issue west?) won‚Äôt problem six months Joe Rogan thing? think mainly level exposure viral load. Medical professionals exposed virus much frequently much higher load.

At least die, that's main thing vaccines designed protect against. Effective enough avoid serious complications. OP pretty clearly implied ‚Äúlit‚Äù in, music festivals AMONG NORMAL THINGS. Nowhere indicate music festivals sole factor determining ‚Äúlit‚Äù summer. something arrived initiative. Sorry apparently take everything face value can‚Äôt read lines.

LOL dude admit you‚Äôre wrong move on. science says starters. entire sub ridiculous months now. Despite ~half adults US sort immunity point, pandemic still WORSE 6 months ago. lift restrictions over. really hate masks like Fauci. Many countries travel bans US Europe due Covid. bans aren‚Äôt going end populations vaccinated too, they‚Äôll get vaccines US/Europe takes care populations first.  thought proportion issue, think makes sense see data approach roughly half vaccinated, groups roughly size. However even 70% vaccinated, would interesting see cases smaller unvaccinated group still exceed cases much larger vaccinated group. anywhere near rate decline. 

what fuck anti-vaccine, pseudoscience comment section even doing?  dont get city‚Äôs emergency order requiring masks separate order, still effect

So, mandated mask lifted not? Could go supermarket maskless?  don‚Äôt go, don‚Äôt give shit.  Lieutenant Governor actually Buffalo. ok protection face recognition yesss, days enjoying lot read subreddit. lot good news!! mRNA natural infection show similar protection real world analysis antibody response. Infection plus mRNA shows strongest antibody response though isn‚Äôt real world data go (at least know of). 

For locations short supply vaccine, previously infected probably wait vaccine supply chain improve eventually get vaccinated boost immune response. know everyone pretending changes anything.

I'm pretty sure that's problem. infographic (I hope) unintentionally says even vaccine, 90% do/want still requires wear mask, terrible message send especially anyone 'on fence' getting it. I‚Äôm traveling weekend one shot Pfizer far, I‚Äôm getting second couple days return. need get tested get back home? heard 1 shot 80% effective. Wait thought standing together huge crowds fine long everyone wearing mask....thats reddit would believe anyway last year.... soon cases stop shooting up, start things cause cases shoot up.

Makes total sense. Ok NPC all.

That's small percentages matter though understanding individual risk translates public health. vaccines great individual level downright amazing. small percentages escapes multiplied hundreds millions people still millions people public health recommendations reflect small percent huge number still large number.  Guideline teachers classrooms 20+? Yes, state high vaccination rates. you‚Äôre Maine, you‚Äôll able pretty soon. live Alabama, I‚Äôd either move keep mask  lose credibility.

It amazing that, 13 months, still people think government actively trying manipulate people, rather simply giving sound advice.  There‚Äôs fair amount evidence someone vaccinated *not* going transmission vector. That's true. Soon would essentially signaling vaccinated, they've ample opportunities so. think close point start ridiculing people vaccinated.   submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

But mother said read people doesnt know got vaccine baby stillborn guy infertile! 

She also said make prone catch fake flu liberals worried make us wear mask allow government control us more.

(Serisouly get vaccinated people, hard believe people 70s smarter people vaccines) equally likely mask mandates serve purpose. Interesting point mentioned article: Sputnik AstraZeneca use HEK-293 cell line grow adenovirus whereas J&amp;J uses PER.C6.

According article, PER.C6 less likely problem adenovirus regains ability replicate. expert India's figure similar back January. someone explain scientific differences kids language me? I've met quite people wear masks anyone giving shit, actually believe it. second there's means require wear mask (short requiring proof vaccination), they'll stop wearing them. people already vaccinated likely people that, enjoying it, mind wearing mask longer means hopefully getting quicker. easier make everyone wear still. They're bad. Or, know, seropositivity grossly overestimated like Manaus... Well chances getting spreading vary vaccine, anywhere 6-25% exposed get it, vaccine eliminates chance serious harm others vaccinated, recommended still wear mask herd immunity eventually reached. think point go get vaccinated eventually go maskless. least 75% people vaccinated, masks stay. know someone tested positive 3 times past 6 months. many people think 95% equals 100%. Unless comes blood clots case even 0.0001% matters. Actually, don't. AZ producing lots doses EU problem continues export majority  still get it. effectiveness number population wide number. doesn‚Äôt account individual level risk. elderly, immune compromised, etc. different results. 

For example, 18 fully vaccinated people nursing home got covid unvaccinated employee. One died. Spread time I've seen question asked never response. likely source ""well aunt/cousin works hospital that's saying"". agree statement, it‚Äôs odd we‚Äôre seeing reasonable spike states like Oregon Washington. high vaccination rates yet seen increasing covid cases since middle March. Massachusetts, although they're lifting week.  
 
I'm told there's heavy social pressure SF, DC, Chicago, despite lack actual mandate. Can't personally confirm though cousin works vaccine industry studying COVID-19 vaccine released public.

They recommend still wear mask vaccine wards COVID's killing strand, still possible catch another strand (IE. infectious less killing). specific strand catch still kill people well (possibly. Again, less killing, mean killing) 

That people supposed tell difference fully vaccinated person \[that wearing mask\] person going masking?

It's safer wear mask keep attention you. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs on/off switch. immunity rising time shot two-week point testing said maximum. Day 13 day 14 probably aren‚Äôt different.

Letting run course since last March would utter disaster also would looked like pointless waste lives vaccine dropped next year. Florida ""ok"" many restrictions mean would universally true everywhere - could gotten lucky could regional factors make spread less easily there. Again, see India example restrictions seeming work blowing face. Would really take bet New York would result Florida they'd never done anything since last year? Know what‚Äôs plant based inject? Cocaine  way says memorial day. way.

I doubt he'd give timeline even July 4th early, though think symbolic end July 4th decently likely. There's also idea requiring *everyone* still wear masks, we're avoiding issue verify people actually vaccinated order wear mask. imagine many ""anti-mask, anti-vax"" people lie say they've vaccinated finally wear mask without publicly shamed. people write articles like this. don‚Äôt see issue hand, obtuse. Dude 3 year old nephew turned onto Uncrustables indeed shit. think significant amount people saying wear masks around non household members indoors wear outside.  mistake give people information mask faulty. leads people making wrong interpretations information cannot controlled.

You look studies country practical way wear mask times home household, public car. fact vast majority people live near people good practice wear mask time even walking neighborhood. letting everyone decide interpret guidance fly got us hundreds thousands dead people.

There downside going nation full mask use like countries did, socially sometimes legally unacceptable wear mask about.

Getting hung science differences infectious scenarios drastically ignores science society behavior people statistics.

If argue need mask go beach anti mask. Yes beach safer bathrooms aren't, food vendors arn't, entrances arn't. societal pressure social one minority mask measurable. doubt many people got covid sitting maskless beach socially distant plenty got covid spread around going beach.

So argue masks needed go beach socially distance knowing group going spread covid use information, often poorly, make judgments what's safe. side coin one piece information can't kill people, ""wear mask public."" works simple even mis interrupted extra mask use downside unless anti mask think wearing harmful somehow. sure! go summer camp every year, every year try leave summer camp flu. I'm adamant sharing bottles, cups, joints, strangers. I'm generous hell, want whiskey, better cup, want smoke, better pipe, papers. I've straight given stranger something go enjoy show, rather sharing something put mouth on. Amazing, first vaccine today , beat  Imagine getting brain poked twice day, that's gonna suck. Necessary measure though Mandatory curbside home delivery thing. People never needed enter stores all...just like restaurant take out. would prevented infection many more! many safety measures overlooked, sadly. Honestly I‚Äôm struggling believe it. I‚Äôm Ontario people know first dose everyone know three people reported side effects besides arm hurting. Everyone else complained variation low grade fever/body aches/headache/drowsiness. Quite frankly using 4 vaccines western world counties certainly come covid vaccine. think productive yet fair enough! I‚Äôd still say Texas removal mask mandate politically scientifically informed decision less got lucky. might nearly impossible get severe COVID symptoms still possible spread virus people vaccinated. Therefor enough population vaccinated best wear mask. Also 95% population level number. Individuals may experience lower effectiveness. elderly, instance. 15% world population vaccinated point, remainder several years. continue new variants outbreaks foreseeable future. Finally testing olympics athletes actually worry about. Yeah agree. 

My point sub hated idea rejected science involved level individual, possible implications public policy. issue tons restaurants placing people tables like used to, without distancing. I've seen restaurants people sitting booths directly next added barriers. People's heads literally 6"" apart behind them.

I think restaurants finding workaround ""50% capacity"" rules many places place. They're going rated fire capacity building, likely double actual pre-COVID seating capacity. they're essentially operating 100% capacity argument they're legal someone comes knocking. 

Indoor dining still good idea ask me. not. vaccine doesn‚Äôt carry risk long Covid symptoms, whereas 1 4 Covid patients still lingering conditions recovery (which vaccines shown alleviate, way.) 

The thing note generalizability results. authors careful state natural immunity par vaccine immunity based prior Qatari studies, similar studies conducted Denmark US suggest natural immunity slightly lower vaccine immunity. suggest countries widespread testing, therefore might working comprehensive data conducting studies (because they‚Äôre also taking account people tested positive asymptomatic vs Qatar, asymptomatic carriers likely ever gotten tested). also note Qatar‚Äôs population skews younger (which also reflected sample). 

For overwhelming majority people, reason suggest shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated. un-vaxxed part applies said person part household vaccinated person visiting whose individual Covid risk low. second dose full month first one wonder certain places states institutionalize slightly longer gap shots. random person called douchebag walking outside without mask on. I'm vaxxed. that's today's vibe! Question - vaccine administrated babies kids? Otherwise never get antibodies, right? Cali 5 cases per 100k Florida 26 per 100k. That‚Äôs massive difference bro didn‚Äôt hear vaccinated nursing home residents got covid unvaccinated workers?  mention that, ideology aside, basic hygiene something wooks known for.

Teamwork. Even assumed .5% population infected going forward, that's \~1/1000. That's far cry ""one million"". One thousand times likely, fact. want point flights India banned variant terrifying. would urge everyone mask regardless guidelines. Posted another thread, I'm surprised negative response CDC guidance subreddit.

I get many folks relaxing guidance outdoor mask wearing make much difference. somebody Northeast state maybe 80% people wear masks outdoors, *it's really big shift*. One things hate pandemic feel like can't walk street sans mask without folks giving dirty looks, I'm hopeful guidance help change that.

And wearing masks indoors? Still makes sense little bit longer everybody wants vaccine complete vaccination cycle. Folks sub claiming ""but vaccine open everybody!"" seem pretending immunity comes immediately. We'll reach point soon, sure, quite yet Safer even indoor restaurants, people want indoor dining back, safe not.  Sure does. Mask unmask necessary. Near 100% prevention death, near 100% prevention moderate severe cases. mean that's impossible, mean people overreacting mild cases going hospital anyways. really think there's specific threshold discomfort go ER COVID. November December, variant started spreading Manaus. So, flights leaving Manaus possibly carrying infected passengers many places Brazil world. Even scientists detected problem, Brazil‚Äôs government didn‚Äôt cancel flights. Many patients family members transferred cities Brazil treatment, flights continued. **The variant spreading, bit bit, taking over.**

We increase gatherings end year. January February, P.1 spread Brazil. March, [the variant spread] synchronized way: [Brazilian] states high transmission rates time. **P.1 2.4 times transmissible, comparison first wave infections(B117).** It‚Äôs possible yet compare P.1 two variants [from Kent South Africa].

I Pasco, Florida. already 1 death P1. 68% B117 time. spread echoes Brazil every way. mandates lockdown/rollback measures. simple recommendation wear masks indoors public places. used pretty uniform mask wearing 5 6% non-mask wearers. we're facing 50% non-mask wearers. 50% wear masks, 25% wearing incorrectly (nose exposed, inadequate fit, pulling mask speak), wearing useless masks thin masks (handkerchiefs, gators, thin surgical masks, masks made foam). we're left perhaps 25% wearing masks correctly. 75% population risk - minus vaccinated individuals, still significant portion individuals capable spreading P1. noted significant travel trips vacations, family outings, camping, tourism, barbecues. continuous lack adherence CDC guidelines coupled elation socializing getting vaccinated (socializing unmasked full immunization) caused multiple breakthrough cases, repeat infections (I seen people 2 3 times year) community spread every variant. Since P1 active community, matter time population succumbs it. matter children killed restrictions now

Wow wow speechless here.

You base much fear anecdotes. Give facts debate.

Remember disease disproportionately kills frail elders spare young. Testing make lick difference stay isolated home. need tested virus exposed close contact anyone outside house several weeks. 5% also reflected low level testing though. weren‚Äôt tests readily available, ill people tested. Correct  find phenomenal people aged 75-79 took vaccine ONS (office national statistics) thought existed. vaccine rate recorded 101%.  seen many people Burning Man, planning individual level could take year too. Sometimes I‚Äôm cynical wonder similar airport security 9/11. still removing belts shoes nonzero chance terrorist try smuggle weapon shoes, although chance high enough worth hassle? chances contracting spreading COVID ever zero?

I think fair question. level risk willing accept, reasonable expect vaccinated people continue inconvenienced might remotely possible still get infected severe disease? longer go without guidance fear level risk accept actually zero. actually go main site. USA facts, google USA facts.org, chose 'how many COVID-19 vaccines distributed'. US total (smaller CDCs) state state breakdown.

For world data, go ourworldindata.org, choose yellow banner. That's coronavirus link. takes bunch charts, choose 'table' see data easier format. Ourworld data separate chart US vaccines, also includes world information, countries.

Most data released, fact data going slightly under-reported time data processed new data. State data least prior day (but could several days), cases vaccines day reported.

I've always confused data reported, specifically vaccines cases. know population changing factor, estimate percent vaccinated. determined state, fully vaccinated people take one day (either second dose one dose) two weeks second? non-residents credited towards home state (with vaccination numbers). cases, case positive test live? I've always wondered about. Well, cases sure, vaccines. 

I know numbers trickle numbers see today could several days, yesterday. sure that. storage requirements alone make Pfizer untenable third world developing countries, vaccine ongoing requirement many many years yet. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article That's baseline data works. initial data suspect comparing different strains coronavirus, contagious may likely re-infect. can't predict end result vaccines new variants. far, data come promising - even prevent coronavirus, stop hospitalization major illness. 

The baseline data show nearly vaccinated persons severe cases hospitalization. would expect vaccination rolls even cases go hospitalization go time. loosen restrictions, yes, cases likely go among unvaccinated people take precautions, would expect relatively cases COVID-19 transmission among vaccinated persons. Prevention end point vaccination, reducing severe cases was.

We would expect rate infection would dependent behavior susceptible persons (e.g. unvaccinated persons never infected) number susceptible people left. people susceptible high vaccination rates, would potentially see rate infection go close 0 due herd immunity. Alternatively, could see clusters locations COVID-19 cases spike lock again, likely outcome. Lol. Imagine thinking head NIAID *chief medical advisor President* talking public health policy, exam statement validating Joe fucking Rogan same. Chicago Illinois. People know risks. It‚Äôs time move on. Wear mask, don‚Äôt wear one. Keep distance, wash hands, keep hands mouth. Simple basic hygiene. you‚Äôre sick, stay home. want inject ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù body. Go ahead. don‚Äôt, good you. I‚Äôm tired contradicting information. Let live want live. respect others respect me. Let‚Äôs live. covid dose stay one group, don‚Äôt vaccinate children get old Vulnerable said ""avoiding"" Good thing MTA limiting train occupancy  phone autocorrect, chill Sounds like something would find Star Trek. remember one old episodes travel back time end hospital nursing home, brought simple pills future immediately cured terminal illnesses lol Luckily there's lot overlap people refuse get vaccinated people careless past year already caught COVID.  It‚Äôs nice hanging unvaccinated friends like show arrogance insult others, you?

Here cite important conclusion ""Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, wide-spread testing associated COVID-19 mortality per million people"".

You find many papers draw similar conclusion, another example think year appreciate whether better overestimate underestimate risk contracting covid. No, see wouldn't. Covaxin uses ""old fashioned"" method using dead deactivated versions virus itself. Similar flu shots.

Either way even breakthrough infections occur chances death hospitalization far vaccinated people still low means they're working. think need read again. provide 1 example vaccinated person spreading covid? I‚Äôve heard hypothetically possible Fear Factor celebrity. Listen guy got famous people eat elk penis lay beds filled cock roaches. definitely knows he‚Äôs talking about. still confused oozing arrogance? submitting source bothered read digest. think forgot /s sure getting downvoted lol. choir past year, wearing masks, 6 feet apart. Yeah little different definitely hard. gotta listen better galaxy brain take Renowned infectious disease expert epidemiologist Joseph Rogan, oh wait ... 

At one point Bill Burr called lack understanding refreshing. essentially said ""we can't pretend know what's going without background credentials"" Ironically, Joe Rogan looks like nasty virus. knew India's outbreak pretty serious, expect serious. found 5 days ago. low chance getting (5800 75,000,000) like it, get might asymptomatic could pass others, yeah numbers low see mask thing lasting much longer.

What'll really fun go back masks variant breaks that's immune vaccine radically different they'd revamp vaccine one goes back masks says screw it. we'll worry happens haha That‚Äôs Home Depot‚Äôs gardening aisle mosh pit. people immune deficiencies, vaccinations effective.

Exactly. hoping CDC post guidelines people immune deficiencies --mostly people see still quite cautious even though vaccinated. How‚Äôd long-term trials go vaccines?

Oh wait Yeah, agreed. pretty massive flub beginning. Obviously yes. hit herd immunity enough people immune outbreaks can't go control, mask mandates ended every state. 

It's insane people think action taken due once-in-a-century pandemic continue pandemic ends. still pandemic still going on, ask India. 

Masks indoors likely one last things required honestly hard it? making tradeoffs different mitigation methods, choose opening non-essential travel ending indoor mask mandates, etc etc masks last thing left, pandemic end back normal masks. Go see damn friends. vaccinated. gonna worry one infinitesimally small number breakthrough infections might well move shack woods. true. Countries taking things seriously making science political issue ones stayed top world. Exactly! People never go grocery stores, either. Curbside home delivery mandated immediately.

I say ""mandated"" yes, option things vaccinated use them. every area option delivery everyone car curbside though.   

I'm one lucky ones multiple options delivery pickup. couple weeks ago last time set foot store March last year. I'm much happy shopping I'm vaccinated, I'm familiar it, might still choose get things delivered I'm feeling sick rather go sure. I'll certainly still wear mask post-covid I'm feeling weather (or pollen count high) . masks get vaccine? Well shoot maybe wear seatbelt since got airbags. much tested that? never intentionally anyone one dose, I'm sure people reason they‚Äôre asymptomatic possible test picking remnants original infection? I‚Äôve read news stories people testing positive months. People aren‚Äôt getting vaccine unlikely give shit chart. That‚Äôs science. I'm also lawsuit, agree ""single dose"".

Here's why: next hearing May 26. decision expected 'in June'. Unless literally June 1st 2nd, EU already swim vaccines Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, possibly Curevac then. talking extra doses AZ due lawsuit, AZ stop deliveries completely (well - never know). top, EU member states already vaccinate younger age groups, possibly infection rates low. ideal playing field Vaxzevria...

I think

* UK moral right doses (developed Oxford, early government funding)
* way doses leave UK, except COVAX

So unless talking delivery May quantity corresponding least day vaccines administered EU (most likely 4 5 million June), really worth it. I'm still hopeful compromise. It‚Äôs haven‚Äôt proved cannot are. way science works everything possible it‚Äôs proven impossible lol you‚Äôre one said pharmacists credibility mailman‚Äôs credibility you‚Äôre trying call nutjob? laughably ironic  Even vaccine still contract virus, (it's kill get way less changes catching it) 

So want keep playing safe, continue Mask however relax it. 

Also, point mask part attire, might well, keep matching mask shirt.  I'm bot human.

Now seriously, Bolsonaro filth. He's deranged things cares money killing leftists. Contrarians aren‚Äôt going pay kind part chart. it‚Äôs like arguing one:
  Username checks out. Um nope, I'm vaccinated even carry mask anymore. one said thing. county health official slapped restraining order going stores confronting people wearing actually, pretty funny. 1. 10-15 years mostly funding. approved vaccines well way certified safe outside emergency use completed standard safety protocols. 
2. have, before, eradicated disease reduced severity ton diseases using vaccines. may mutation evades vaccines, happened yet. sooner people get shots, better odds preventing happening are.
3. That's true. mRNA vaccines contain instructions produce proteins alter anything genome. essentially make cells produce bunch spike proteins immune system begins mount response proteins commits response memory. need incentives via relaxed restrictions drive vaccinations Effective enough avoid serious complications.

In vast majority cases, yes. course US we've 77 fully vaccinated people die COVID far, seems like serious complication.  totally overhaul hospitals

overwhelm? really, 99% countries didnt dare cut flights China Moderna anything like Pfizer - pretty much everything says - protected ever nine days second shot.

Pfizer's phase 3 results showed estimated efficacy 91% dose two six days dose two, 95% seven days dose two onward. Moderna study way - reported estimated efficacy 14 days after, 94%. reason think would different Pfizer actually broke similar fashion. Yeah true thought exactly this. Believe there's states union Illinois. 

And case - what's point? Whether governor ending CDC ending it, fact remains permanent. It‚Äôs though. HUGE platform listeners irresponsibly giving uninformed medical advice people trust him. Yeah do. know people who.do. committed listeners me! HATE needles, also experience. nurse administered great barely felt all! That's they're shipping US alone. That's enough 10% population fully vaccinated month. The're delivering countries well (Canada's getting 8 mil May going 10 mil July).

And US seems close point enough herd immunity stop spread. US covid numbers drop HARD month.

Finally found really need 1 two shots get benefits, countries might False equivalency. vaccines cases deaths drop, result masks necessary. 

There safety measures car accident besides seat belt focused driving. think EU actually expecting get doses UK, well aware even judge orders AZ ship AZ tries comply UK block it.


I think idea establish AZ contracted UK manufacturing sites EU. done, invalidates argument AZ may make supply shortfall due unforeseen production issues. would place AZ breach contract judge order make EU whole, including shipping doses non-contracted sites. Even AZ unable comply order, places bad spot later restitution lawsuit.  basically trump admin left things states. really comprehensive Federal priori consideration fate Incas Aztecs enough evidence you?  got (first part, second, I'm fully vaccinated yet) COVID vaccine, feel fine.

Is arm going start hurting get sore point hurts, even stretching arm?

Yes. Yes, will. that's low risk compared bigger risk choosing take vaccine.

So please, get vaccinated. Yes 100% can. said moronic.  I'm terrified needles, definitely something ran mind first time going get shot. But, person administered great feel shit. yeah, agree someone might hesitant due fear needles, reading right now: bad benefit outweighs moment discomfort! said once, I'll say again. Joe Rogan's moron.  see gym doors everything masks. young people it‚Äôs everyone old young mid masks. Shit right, 5% number infected control group. Sorry, skipped breakfast left mind home high intensity inside workout. already get winded fuck waterpolo, dont think coul handle waterboarding time 1. vast majority time spent garnering funding, going administrative red tape regulatory agencies, enrolling trials. Due widespread urgency particular vaccine, hurdles largely eliminated allowed rigorous clinical trials performed without sacrificing effectiveness. Additionally, groundwork vaccines development decades given early sequencing virus' genome, pharmaceutical companies able get head start development disease even widespread. Finally, clinical trials generally take longer wait certain number people trial actually contract disease - since COVID currently pandemic easy catch, made trials faster.
2. Viruses mutate, current vaccines effective new variants antibody response factor immune response. Even efficacy disease decreased, prevention death remains intact (which top priority).
3. Simply true. mRNA vaccines cannot interact DNA way. mRNA naturally produced cells set instructions make protein. mRNA temporary represents instructions protein, mRNA breaks soon protein produced. way vaccines work injecting instructions, causes cells create small piece virus (meaning cannot get COVID it) promptly fight off. mRNA never enters cell nucleus (naturally injected) mechanism alter DNA. Besides, available vaccines use mRNA technology, even though concern gene alteration mRNA vaccines, traditional vaccines available well. happens anti bodies wear off?  Define ""elderly"". wife mid-60s (not ""elderly"" book) little reaction Pfizer shots. Epidemiologists projected actual mortality rate ten times high one reported forecasting India reach grim milestone million COVID-19 deaths end August



Heartbreaking. almost certainly rely completely numbers science make decisions

I hope so. whole fiasco misleadingly recommending masks earlier pandemic (apparently secretly concerned supply, despite publicly proclaiming ineffective personal use) inspire confidence assertion. going believe pandemic simply told to.

They told serious capacity, almost public health guidelines enforced meaningful countries well majority citizens actively try killing loved ones going outside trying live normally

Because guidelines heavily enforced, optional. can't depend something nebulous ""personal responsibility"" majority country uneducated actual problem experience dealing problem. State Texas Covid physician here. numbers absolutely cratered. It‚Äôs wonderful. holding breath Southern states typically well spring due good weather start increasing August trapped inside due excessive heat. People mock idiots. Absolutely. prayers stupid. prayers innocents infect. Implying ever any‚Ä¶ Despair issue relying officials state level, interested whatsoever public health, business. 

So trust? enough people cancel premium let Spotify know bullshit yesterday reason, possibly really sucks. I've thinking quitting well. pandemic made aware incompetent lot leadership is. much really care kids teachers. We're suffering shortage though. make right try derail another country's supply? like UK sitting around loads unused doses. Immunity last forever, perfect. reason wear seatbelt even though airbags, reason lock locks door. Eventually anti bodies able fight infection get decent viral load. think got vaccine need protect yourself, understand vaccines. vaccine ever 100% effective, vaccine given someone life long immunity disease. never got tested covid positive early sept 2019 1 month week spent week clients Beijing. since shit kicked I've sick year wife covid last may, would impossible caught it. Plus usually get cold twice year, near Xmas spring. put distancing mask wearing. 

With regards study, I'm talking noise wild. Facebook, Twitter, here. There's shit ton information really, really hard cut bullshit figure truth. Plus people freaking polarising everyone talking conviction they're correct. Well 140 million people least one dose far US, it‚Äôs small sample size all. Scientists said need time research. sing chorus mask on? hardly understand people saying sometimes. So? vaccine passports cities/states/countries, /r/chicago. Yeah also realized listeners taking saying seriously instead entertainment (Eddie Bravo Alex Jones episodes conspiracies) that's like iight time channel background noise. [Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna 95 percent effective preventing symptomatic illness. 100% effective preventing hospitalization ""source"" risk reduction 1 dose 2 dose vaccine. think make fair point perfect often enemy good. also want get rid masks, think CDC recommendations correct. 

The CDC put infographic recommendations 330 million people. graphic saying safe vaccine, free clear everywhere yet. vaccination rates go up, open up. 

We need stay course little longer. like running marathon, giving last mile. stay course little longer. 

Also, 80% US unlikely vaccinated. Even less likely south. People say like masks, take steps get rid them. that's masking vaccine really is. Wearing mask getting vaccine way get rid disease need masks. That's goal. things loosening, hold little longer! point, mandates don‚Äôt matter much anyway. People don‚Äôt want wear masks outdoor large gatherings already it.  42% fully, 58.4% least one dose! Really proud live right now. live? That‚Äôs significantly stricter CDC guidelines err side overly strict safe don‚Äôt play sports. I‚Äôm 34 years old kid enjoy playing baseball 8 years old. seem quite angry scared covid. That‚Äôs fine, know - like said - choice. Sooner? Chicago even announced going go along state's reopening plan yet -- plan include vaccinate passports kind. anything, sign city intends keep restrictions far longer rest Illinois. got vaccine wall changed colour case express skepticism, may wrongly picked up.

check happened Italy Covid first struck. India beds facilities per 10000, waves like current one totally exhausted, even additional facilities exhausted. people dying streets home. many people can't afford cost test, treatment. People dying queues admission, waiting days getting bed. Lure house ""end up"" pharmacy? kid, mostly. Maybe overwhelmed trying figure process. TIL: ONS multiple meanings confirm.  Given every particularly worrisome variant (e.g. UK, Brazil, SA) made almost immediately, would expect won‚Äôt happen every new variant? haven‚Äôt changed anything...

I think good thing mRNA vaccines seem effective known variants easily updated (with FDA already stating allow expedited trials) anything new pops up. Nice! schools open whole time too. amazing schools ""dangerous"" certain areas. Pfizer/BioNTech ultra high efficacy incredibly reliable terms supply. 

Even UK ordered 60 million extra Pfizer/BioNTech doses. telling, know is. Video also mentions failure Covax see logic argument. vaccinated people common sense. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, wearing mask optional. it‚Äôs businesses want mandate masks not. 

Or pay people money get vaccinated, tie benefits it. Right now, ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù vaccinated isn‚Äôt appealing apathetic hesitant. CDC needs change that. think meant say: *doesn't matter, though.*

And that's correct, study concerned distancing beyond 6 feet. randomly demanding supply another country. AZ sold doses made UK. plants listed contract well. Please note numbers efficacy preventing symptoms, 'preventing infection'.

Vaccinated people low chance getting sick prevent becoming asymptomatic carriers infecting people. There's little farm nearby visitors come see pigs, chickens, goats, rabbit, even feed things like lettuce celery. There's clear sign saying feed rabbits anything lettuce celery, ***they die.*** think lot. know that, carrots actually good rabbits (too much sugar), single carrot going end life‚Äîbut terrify children overfeeding them, absolutely will.

But given many people vapid self centered been. mind, getting vaccine huge turning point, go outside peace mind, visit unvaccinated people mask, etc. great feeling. However, war over, still need substantially higher percentage vaccinated declare total victory.

I understand majority people socializing vaccinated begin with, course feels like point. They're selfish never really cared anyway, course see ""I'm gonna get give alone want right away"" .

Though he‚Äôs people show clearly disagrees with. He‚Äôs also hosted debates 2 people come differing viewpoints. endorsing people even though disagree other? journalist endorsing serial killer televising interview them?

He obviously opinions/biases makes clear, it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs conflict interest isn‚Äôt disclosed. also don‚Äôt think source information, fact get multiple viewpoints perspectives large issue controversy. facts opinions front allows come conclusion makes sense overall.

People shouldn‚Äôt live echo chambers listening want hear confirm biases. take many different views, especially contradict current viewpoint. still opinion that‚Äôs great! You‚Äôve pitted viewpoint others seen still stands up.  pull mask face, place food mask slingshot mouth. sucks. found 24 hour gym. go times. True. factory capacity simply isnt enough - never was. 

That also reason AZ sued one‚Äôs laaaaaadiiiiies plans come anytime soon. two years ago, I'm sure I'll go next. 

I guess I'll rely media trust giving accurate information situation India. stand original comment. Rogan allowed voice opinion Spotify's ability censor free speech. I'm sick people want hear agree with. like Joe Rohan listen him. turn around soon. idea breaks vaccine infection acquired immunity?  following news last year seems countries done well, well well future. Iceland New Zealand come mind. Israel well, but, big but, great assistance Palestinians occupied territories. almost certainly come back bite them. Others might added list. 

You probably right country escape 100% scot free, ""worst"" mean vastly different things different places.  would change message   addition, site let search second doses location brand Sorry bullshit.

EU capacity deliver domestically, EU chose (I aplaud that) export unlike UK US. drawback currently behind catch up.

If ever meet perfect place, let know havnt (and thats working 3 continents)   also heard single layer cloth masks fairly ineffective. Definitely think us added risks can‚Äôt yet get vaccine invest high quality masks. Particularly rest world getting vaccinated longer need wear them.   Anyone half brain knew that. Looks like Jones last person realise. True. certainly worked rest world. Wait... wanna get people fence vaccinated? way. people probably already new ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù anyway.

Change message. better. American individualism problem. vaccine you. population. Personal protection aim, herd immunity is. question stands. high school sports important? US one countries this. 1-dose, actually half 300%. top that, half logistics also benefit. But, hey...cat pictures, right?

I long days annoying thing social media. Oh no, horrible pictures pets, babies plates food. We've evolved past nonsense unintelligible, angry screaming instead. Progress! Spotify heavily advertising podcast every time visited site, bothered due past insensitive comments various social issues willingness invite far-right extremists onto show ""dialogue.""

Just another reason irritated - and, I'm sure, since made comments loud, confident voice, people take seriously despite fact contradict scientific consensus public health advice. Dr. Barron: recommended still get second dose. Natural infection may always give broad-antibody protection comparable vaccines. wait get second dose completed isolation period feeling better. ensure get second dose within 90 days infection recommended get convenient. He‚Äôs comedian. hell expect? He‚Äôs supposed say controversial things.

Seriously? ‚ÄúHis brash use n word‚Äù
I‚Äôm biggest fan purposefully making look like racist smth. problem adults using word talking word itself. He‚Äôs using laundry. 

Comments like make really depressed soft clueless people exist. mean, safest way sex per Canadian health authorities. Mine too. actually telling getting noticed quite bit, group looking people include studies. guess women going menopause also got periods. Semantics. Saying need worry something like effectively saying matter. 

Everyone needs contribute herd immunity. *airborne* virus that's mutating. fucking joke. individual risk, societal risk. right say wants, he's wrong this, misinformation. like people parrot 99% people survive covid over. technically true taken context(550k+ dead) effectively promotes propagation virus people letting guard down. Wear walk in, take seated. I'm making rules, I'm explaining probably asked mask up. mask less political rallies religious gatherings. Nope, that. genuinely curious don‚Äôt know: you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, wear mask all? hope know trying pain. pose questions get right answer get rid masks ones vaccinated. funny gym go people vaccinated wear masks better ones aren't. 

I mean big surprise people took seriously still careful ones didn't. guy expertise matter gave opinion - alternative? ban this? really society wish have? Dr. Kutner: Data available to-date seem show vaccines decrease transmission COVID person person. thought bass anything buck we're stagnant 50-60% population vaccinated

Which heavily skewed towards risk population, first vaccinated. 

The aim stop people filling hospitals dying, risk protected that's exactly what'll happen even there's still transmission. get side effects flu vaccine, 103.5 fever, worst chills life, kidney issues (I pre-existing kidney problems tho) take two days work covid vaccine.... Joni rogaine fucking moron. 55.7% adults received least one dose vaccine.

It's amazing well we've done four months (and seems like really start taking February). Still ways go, that's hell lot doses four months. Yeah wear space suit oxygen tank everywhere go, super easy, never get infected Dr. Kutner: clarify Dr. Barron's answer - referring people may get mild case COVID infection even though vaccinated. People cannot get COVID infection vaccine itself.  Give i'm ill more, think is. would terrified couldn‚Äôt say controversial things airwaves. GEORGIA.

Everyone live mess count lucky. tf going wear mask ik bar I'm going drink/eat ‚Äúthe average someone dies Covid older average life expectancy US‚Äù

Which like, shittons diseases life expectancy drug pretty hard infant mortality fatal accidents. Dr. Zane: think never auto-immune reactions mRNA vaccines. people COVID, recovered, still producing antibodies? Dr. Barron: time reports complication.  healthy stop spreading someone else compromised immune system. 

Also dude pretty active got it. make master cell bank, run out? Especially screaming drool spit.

We must different experiences rollercoasters. CDC literal interpretation;

\- never able live without masks face ever again. man moron. always high, can‚Äôt get cohesive thought speaks absolute confidence. cannot stand Rogan. Seriously, people question anything must Russia shills. Us NPC's gotta due diligence downvote heathens LETS FUCKIN GO North Carolinian here. Nearly half entire population able vaccinated (16+) least 1 shot. point, elderly vulnerable vaccinated little now. way shape form going Canada going through. reason us NC wear masks outside. dumb make sense. It‚Äôs money stopped listening moved Spotify. actions since make glad jumped bandwagon did. Well actually know someone got vaccine (Astra Zeneca) got diagnosed positive. risk factors vaccine probably saved life (otherwise would probably dead) still got I'm guessing chances probably higher think. Dr. Kutner: Studies ongoing regarding effectiveness vaccines. know people enrolled vaccine trials followed longer time period.  enough masks, use cloth masks. Instead saying masks ineffective. Take note CDC.  Get shot.  brainer.

You might feel little Monday, maybe Tuesday. big deal. Cowboy deal it. right call. got vaccine already tracked information since register. wouldn‚Äôt hurt government setup app database output QR code scan well. Hell gotta leave airports test, can‚Äôt done vaccine well? one's arguing that. probably still asked mask grocery stores bars awhile. free everywhere else. That's kinda point post.  much respect Joe Rogan, also type believe conspiracies. main thing money keeps flowing in, even though safe go out. Dr. Zane: Moderna Pfizer currently developing boosters. believe 12-16 year olds likely eligible end summer.  claiming vaccines would help India's current situation. need successful vaccine candidates get help prevent happening India happening places. state announced 50% occupancy would post front doors stores. would see ~800ish people allowed grocery store, hardware store, Walmart due 50% capacity... 

I‚Äôm thinking hell 800 people grocery store? Anyone know going India?

Two months ago sort achieved infection based herd immunity cases/deaths rising like crazy, suggesting old antibodies blocking new variant. 

What mean? safe new variant vaccination purely man made tragedy? cares? I'm fully vaccinated, honestly feel comfortable getting children vaccinated.   I'm going wait see goes. young children caught yet, continue doing. Get vaccinated, act like vaccine changes nothing wear mask. Love it! Rogan also thought time last year sauna steam would prevent eliminate virus corrected scientist/physician guest. clear, I‚Äôm talking outdoors. wear mine indoors I‚Äôm around interacting businesses whatnot. mainly mean people wearing masks outdoors weren‚Äôt keeping scientific studies - we‚Äôve known months outdoor transmission nearly impossible. Especially city like SF we‚Äôve got 10mph sustained winds pretty much constantly haha. highly doubt ever going reach levels vaccination think still reach herd immunity half country refuses vaccine? I‚Äôm talking developing countries paying $3 per cap. also confirm full vaccination via AZ would cost Uganda South Africa J&amp;J. fact based contracts already concluded. Charging country like Uganda $7 single dose preposterous measurement. 

Quoting EU figures isn‚Äôt going help argument based upon much benefit vaccines developing world. I‚Äôm speaking perspective middle-income African country and, frankly, nobody offering single African nation prices low offering (far richer) EU member countries AZ. dumb.  Awesome. face-to-face covid patients multiple times week, can‚Äôt wait booster.

Thank time work do! 100% effective death virus?  Dr. Zane: direct, candid, transparent, never altering message science. like magic, real. CNN posts article like this, public health messaging really messed up. actually norm all, anywhere, knowledge. norm wear mask flu *when actively sick coughing sneezing* many places, general population wear mask. also norm general population wear mask areas severe air pollution, fortunately apply vast majority U.S. hate say way force undecided take shot either PAY them, make punitive: give health insurers Medicare option refusing coverage covid-related care opt vaccine. sad fact huge portion population responds monetary incentives disincentives. Children Men begins... name literally propaganda Demand approved vaccine kids 16 yet. also know sure herd immunity % yet, especially accounting variants. I've seen 70% low bar herd immunity certainly month. Keep bugging anyone know made appointment so. best way get completely. texted mother law tell covid, replied say secret safe her. confused. agree people flipping share information. many fake cards people bought already? think might see September airlines require get plane. everyone wants vaccine get gotten surprised see papers needed. get scary people flipping out. really wish vaccination could incentivized. vaccinated person literally can't anything special except travel 1 2 countries common sense allow vaccinated people enter.  Dr. Barron: still learning long-term complications associated COVID-19 know mild case vaccination cause similar long-term effects infection without vaccine. know best way avoid complications COVID-19 get vaccinated! Based social media thought 99.5% people bad side effects.

Probably even social media + lot friends coworkers ended 1/4 apparently

I think 3 people know sample 17 fully vaccinated far get side effects

And super random -- whether Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J; whether people reacted vaccines past -- none mattered, guess happened know lot people got side effects, happened one (I've never side effects vaccine life) get J&amp;J Sunday work Monday? long expect recover? I'm young fairly healthy. exact conversation sister months ago. taking things Bill Gates saying gospel. reminded her‚Ä¶ may well informed, base statements available science educated opinion matter, still means doctor epidemiologist.

I sometimes get bored look podcast episodes... comedians ""interviewed"".

What's point listening trash? Yah seem like there's rise people outright dismiss someone find one political stance, belief. okay different opinions, respectfully disagree. Joe rogan dumbass Covid/vaccines mean completely disregard whole career. hate common nothing fallacies become. BHD assuming ted lisa's ideology based critiques celebrity. That's mean.  motivate money, benefits. Government CDC appeal immediate desires people. may pragmatic, would done greater good.

Otherwise, longer CDC drags out, ammunition Trump 2.0 campaign. Cause he's gonna galvanize hell done mandates, Trump 2.0 good country various reasons. numbers eligible residents ages 16 older. getting medical advice Joe Rogan, bigger problems life Covid   There‚Äôs evidence view, it‚Äôs purely anecdotal. every person doesn‚Äôt wear mask, there‚Äôs probably two wear conform social norms even though don‚Äôt agree. Hi there!
I (28y/o male) got first vaccination (AstraZeneca) early March second follow soon. seems like choose BioNTech Astra. First recommended age. also tend get BioNTech, understanding combination vector mRNA vaccination could trigger higher immune response. thoughts think effective? Thanks AMA! Role look Israel uk? vaccination numbers closer countries named  number coming from? According CDC 120k  Hello there! I‚Äôm 32 I‚Äôm Central Asia . question regarding high level antibodies blood. severe case COVID19 last summer July, unfortunately lost mother vicious disease. brink death myself. straight 19 days fever doctors struggling keep down. 40% lung damage liver received serious complications sickness . Luckily survived , discharged hospital level antibodies blood around 12.6 ( sure units used measure). blood test couple weeks ago (9 month later) see level antibodies turned still level around 12.2 antibodies blood. like that? good something need concerned about? level AB still need vaccinated? region moment access Sputnik V Sinofarm. Thank time. Joe Rogan chode poisoning minds American youth still intellect youth? 

Who would thought? would terrific true. I'd add running podcast, presenting tv show, stand comedy, owning gym owning online store. He's accomplished guy, knows nothing medicine.  point interviewer responsibilty interject.

The problem Rogan fucking stupid know truth lie. Uhhhh yeah think gives hell lot credibility. mailman needs high school diploma lmfao pharmacist fucking PhD dumb fuck     Wallenda referring to? Google says something German acrobats.  honestly think biggest thing really need school system teaches critical thinking problem solving. 

I used listen podcast quite bit tapering lot went spotify (which killed entirely). felt like fair amount honest discussion points brought think myself. also plenty stuff completely disagree with. There's also ton banter half cocked joke ideas. listen anymore really know care particular podcast went. real problem people devoid ability think critically can't evaluate statement, context, whether coming place primarily opinion vs research etc. given actual advice, actually make sense? guests? experts, credentials have, work for, bro-ing bullshitting/bantering podcast seriously describing field study? trying make look good? Etc etc. Joe Rogan (or anyone else, expert otherwise) looks eyes seriously tells something like ""Cigarettes bad you, government propaganda"", would hope enough going head think ""hey, probably right"". Maybe live life advice yet.

This true people love hate podcast. plenty instances something said people heavily criticized clearly cuff remarks jokes. There's also things said authority guise expertise flat incorrect misinformed. Taking celebrity end get advice terrible idea. Even statements coming experts usually worth internalizing thinking about, also checking bit research general consensus applies unique circumstance. moderna vaccine appointment scheduled friday, I'm terrified needles big deal me, someone tell needles use big? look google needle size varies tiny needle huge one I'm kinda scared. Thank you. let's gooo case I'm moving Luxembourg :) Jayson Tatum- Boston Celtics star early twenties got virus still uses inhaler. professional athlete who‚Äôs exercise diet meticulously tracked lasting impacts virus ...don‚Äôt think average ‚Äúyoung fit‚Äù person chance adverse long term effects virus ?

Idk seems like Joe may wrong /s I‚Äôve posted before. kid 3.98 GPA 31 ACT might pass English graduate. We‚Äôre working hard get done done. Clearly, kid isn‚Äôt kid can‚Äôt pass English 12. hasn‚Äôt school since March 12, 2020. She‚Äôs ok. aren‚Äôt ok. true. You‚Äôre seeing anti-mask people idiotic don‚Äôt care people know. There‚Äôs probably twice many wear masks avoid getting called stores. Give opportunity lie way masks they‚Äôll jump Republicans

Please shut up. idiots like dividing country. Stop brainwashed media associating anti vaxxers republicans. makes happy, go ahead spread false info, almost every Republican know taken vaccine encouraged others take it. Stop judging entire party actions few, easily side. much enjoy podcast, think I'll taking advice Joe Rogan whether ought vaccinated. 

That said, think lot people get Rogan things while, particularly he's willing talk anyone show. reaction bit overblown, opinion.

I think best thing Dr Fauci could do, amongst media appearances, would appear Joe Rogan Experience himself, explain Joe he's wrong this. He's serious scientists like Brian Cox, Lawrence Krauss Roger Penrose. see Fauci go himself.  corona sick almost one whole day it... enjoyed two week vacation work. really dont want get vaccine. havent taken vaccines since child really plan getting now. Like would rather people reallllyyy need get do. Ive regular flu felt worse corona. Ill wear mask absolutely required requested to. Lmao wait im eating restaurant friends im supposed wear mask? anyone eat anything face covering on? I'm going restaurant wear restaurant take eat food whole point wearing restaurant? nervous probably idea could happen, didn‚Äôt nerve assume fine cleared virus. Amazing people cannot put people shoes it‚Äôs late. I'm around vaccinated folks; mask off. public crowds, keep mask on, folks know I'm vaccinated not. 

I'm sure transition next month people get vaccinated gradually mask unless indoors mandated (I'm sure local hospital still requiring time, example)  #""sycophant"" I've read explained perfectly elsewhere. people introverts 1) pat back restricting things pre pandemic anyway, like go bars, clubs, know, social activities 2) feel good bashing extroverts tells virtually impossible people fully vaccinated catch transmit virus.

You done good job understanding science then. 

At best, odds symptomatic infection reduced 95% (and it‚Äôs less effective asymptomatic infection transmission). It‚Äôs straight batshit crazy think odds getting infected 1 million vaccination. Lol imagine taking medical advice talking heads number increases two weeks second shot, decreases slowly time goes means boosters time may necessary.

The problem know this--for simple reason vaccinated people long enough know ""1 year"" ""3 years"" ""10 years"" (like [tetanus ""likely never"" (like [measles may require re-uping certain conditions).   Hilarious Joe pretends masks pussies.

When reality people wearing masks pussies whine like little bitches moaning ""Ooh can't breathe mask! poisons CO2 can't think get skin rashes sore throat!""

Fucking pussies can't even wear masks noses. Joe Rogan also takes steroids industrial quantities weed.  YES  Dr. Kutner: research vaccines expedited. studies fully vetted followed standard research procedures. info actually *isn't* there‚Äîyet.

We make guesses viral transmission &amp; vaccinated people looking highly-vaccinated populations like Isreal, proper research studying specifically either way begin‚Äîdon't expect see first answers questions much later year. *looks like* vaccinated individuals less likely spread virus unvaccinated individuals (so far), know much less likely, short windows exposure true, on. entire right side chart ""Indoor"" recommends vaccinated people continue masking; better safe sorry. give rat's ass Fauci said. Hahaha courts requesting govt put lockdown. they're even begging.  used like JRE interesting guests Rogan pretty painfully unfunny. Probably less people died Facui‚Äôs insatiable need change messaging. Dr. Barron: process followed standard scientific safety standards. able complete rapid fashion high number cases circulating allowed differences vaccine placebo met. can't see name without thinking ZIP................................................................................................................................................................................RECRUITER!

Darwinism best!  regular listener, got selectively edited video there.

Joe goading Bill, trying get go rant.

There never moment genuinely telling people wear mask.

Have great day! highly debated. follow scale outbreak India. unlike outbreak that's happened point. sheer scale gatherings happened prior outbreaks ridiculous. Many many massive events involving millions people gathering one place going back homes carrying spreading virus every little corner country. quantity infections unlike anything we've seen yet. also second largest population world. Put together going would thousands upon thousands young patients critically ill dying.   Bill Maher bitching masks vaccines? Oxford cost July AZ choose per contract.  I‚Äôm going say EUs count much higher UKs want work absolutes... you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, wearing mask optional. it‚Äôs businesses want mandate masks not.

And give message right now, almost certainly start new wave hospitalization death unvaccinated realize wear mask anymore say they're vaccinated (if anyone even asks).

There good answers here. Yep. CDC destroying credibility, eventually people going stop listening altogether. Dr. Zane: risks severe COVID symptoms far greater reactions vaccine, even younger healthy people. one major important points vaccination preventing ability spread COVID younger people significant source spread. ‚Äúthe science‚Äù always said border closures useless preventing controlling epidemics. wasn‚Äôt last year countries started clearly didn‚Äôt work considering virus spread world. Good luck finding single pandemic plan public health authority supports closing borders.  It‚Äôs weird young people lesser risk today eventually become old people much higher risk.... listen Joe Rogan comes triangle chokes DMT like. Maybe take rest massive grain salt.  interesting anecdote. think is? 

I know I‚Äôm walking stereotype, yuppie loves dog much. we‚Äôre pretty much inseparable, especially 1.5 years Covid. cant even bring contemplate losing him. risked life Texas Freeze year him. grandparents, old many years think eventual death. dogs life‚Äôs painfully short. wonder part it. dudes entire post history train wreck. Anti-mask, anti-vaccine. He's one knows REAL science. might Joe Rogan's Reddit account. vaccinated person need wear mask barbershop? fuck even help anyone? kind bullshit risk averse lawyer stuff drives conspiracy theorists. dipshit see fully vaccinated, without mask fine. choosing wear mask, despite vaccinated, shows give shit others

Ugh, get cross; need wood. Hopefully helps, 20% Detroit gotten vaccinated compared 50% rest Wayne County Read reply above. paying attention. presidency would've (and have) direct impacts me. mention horribly racist white supremacist comments kept throwing around. couldnt vote could would've voted hillary.

I'm saying Bill Burr, well off, upper middle class white guy probably know whole lot specific political things (basically political normie), time probably didnt matter him. seeing actually capable mentality would've obviously challenged. Hell, even knew getting surprised several times bad got mean ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs reason walking around mask. you‚Äôre middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, **but it‚Äôs providing perfect protection people think is**. And, often, t**here unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.**‚Äù  Fauci¬†told¬†the Washington Post¬† ,¬†a**t beginning COVID-19 pandemic,¬†masks recommended general public, authorities trying prevent mask shortage health workers extent asymptomatic spread unknown.**¬†¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

Weird doctor might know everything virus emerged. Dr. Zane: risks severe disease I'm fully vaccinated, I'm comfortable eating restaurants. Don‚Äôt care, wearing mask indefinitely now. Holy shit, that's good description. That's I'll describe anyone asks. Apparently areas country common. live I've pretty much never seen whole time. want pull Fyre Fest say ""fuck get done couple months!"" last week two painfully slow site. We‚Äôre open walk ins it‚Äôs still dragging. think response going dependent location. Florida, people wear masks outside. hardly see anybody wearing mask outdoors. However see people wearing inside businesses. common sight people walking store building mask, putting right entering, taking immediately exiting. 

So point view, new recommendations seem....well, pointless. Especially since seems focus fully vaccinated people. mean fully vaccinated recommendation *still* wear mask indoors, many people going wonder point vaccine first place.

I mean get it, vaccination guarantee catch possibly spread Covid. since people (down least) wearing mask outdoors. bother? first Pfizer shot, I'm still vaccinated. weeks second shot according studies, somewhere 90% protection area. Two weeks second shot, chances slim. continue wear mask inside businesses still require them. become ""anti-masker"" I'm vaccinated. Businesses guidelines, follow them. chance wear one outside indoor restrictions lifted I'm wearing one. point vaccinated people need return normal life. 

It needs understood, Covid *never* going away completely. vaccines, reaching ""herd immunity"", accept continue seasonal thing peaks valleys, numbers manageable. Actually, vaccines kids might ready that. least 60%. Wow. hoping 75% least would know that? vaccine sites open every day week outside typical atypical working hours. reason would unable get one? He‚Äôs saying that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen, absolutely agree him. parameter opening ‚Äúeveryone vaccinated‚Äù, never open go take look thread, I'm going credit garbage repeating it. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

That said current models showing precipitous drop couple weeks even without restrictions.  gave vaccines away. go then. Move mountains hide forever. Vaccines readily available United States. People moving on. great, help cover 'too busy' 'too lazy' demographics willing get vaccine, got around yet. announced today, details, say going May. worst lockdowns significant portion population seemed think activities life simply matter Next time, virus better wear condom..preferably ripped. Oh really happened? would bad think we're pace currently. Hospital systems would likely strained point. Gosh, f\*\*ked seeing ones love dying right you. Big yikes There's ""an outdoor event September."" much event outside, people traveling event still indoor contact around country, world, even event people mingling inside tents.

Makes sense planners play smart push till 2022. Meanwhile, idiots charge Sturgis appear going forward year despite last year turned super spreader event. only. bit, back surface transmission thought factor. found annoying carry mask, put leaving apartment, take get back, wash hands right away. Trying avoid cross contamination touching mask much. Since leaving apartment, usually running pick groceries/drug store run. said ""crowded"".

In places like California, guidance last year need mask outdoors unless can't distance (6 feet). 

Yes, exactly thing, also seem like big difference. Nobody anti vaccines saying anything like conspiracies bringing up. 

When premature? Anyone wants vaccine go get one today largely protected 10-12 days. Keeping mask laws fall later probably necessary definitely going popular. seriously worth 3/4 months additional restrictions save lives handful anti-vaxxers? doesn't.
The Anvisa approved : Sinovac, J &amp; J, Pfizer, astrazeneca..

Bolsonaro totally Sinovac favor sputnik (even talk putin). make sense think decision political. like China, surprise Haha get it.  option (and recently switched to) leave types combined. However amount hours given per month lower combined leave.  Relationships take time effort.

You get put it.  Fox?  I'm denying important kids get vaccinated, I've never heard anyone complain hospitalization death rate flu, even though higher covid, even vaccine. would've preferred Oxford partnered company production facilities based EU

Not really. hindsight British vaccine nationalism yes. disregarding that, AZ production could fully based UK care - long production shortfalls shared doses exported EU reliably Pfizer way EU blocked exports UK inflict maximise death destruction upon population.

No, no. That's crazy nothing said hints even remotely that. secretly think so. tables turned regarding AZ production vaccine rollout, I'd like think EU would've allowed exports UK long ago, I'd support that. might well smug reddit, that's besides point. Actions speak louder obviously concerned cooperation parity staying night getting angrier angrier

You'd surprised else escalate course night üòÖ Seriously though, really surprised people get angry AZ whatever role UK possibly played underperformance fact UK hand meagre production time UK deaths still higher EU ones.

Nobody ever talked handing *all* production. said sharing. ofc would've taken pandemic situation sides channel consideration. yeah deaths infections UK good case say ""sorry rn, reach threshold"". limit epxorts hardest hit EU members time like Portugal, suffering least much UK back IIRC. kow UK production ain't much, much could shared, anything better nothing flipping finger start came across least.

That might also explain harsh reactions EU. support everything said handled general, memory least (might biased) UK first froze requests exports, commission's tone got shrill. Either way think VDL et al. would've portrayed exports victory perfidious Albion somesuch. possible likely. Maybe think much like gutter press here... worst I'd rather imagine phrasing something like ""rightfully getting what's ours"", problems, deny gesture solidarity either. VDL &amp; Macron oblivious tough sell Johnson.

And sorry get inferiority point last paragraph (sounded quite angry tbh), might wanna explain slow reader, preferably time way get comment deleted mods ;) answer another comments r/europe they're liberal regarding language.

I think comment replied answers comment. totally understand fears domestic supply chain, sad ironic safeguarding risks UK arguably done feared others might it, thus becoming part problem IMHO. Looking things unfolded, like self-fulfilling prophecy. can't guarantee EU never banned exports UK described, realistic all. Cue continued Pfizer exports, 100m doses various vaccines altogether dozens countries even height third wave here, Norway's also EU get shorted. Pfizer suffered shortfalls (as earlier year) every customer supply chain misses afaik. There's reason could different AZ. Sorry hear. colleagues India it‚Äôs hard hear they‚Äôve going through. large EU countries trying order vaccine, yet they're scared AZ jab lol sense theme here, dealing covidiots September cusp? Wow clearly understand herd immunity works.

No, one clearly cannot understand brainwashed. vaccinated can't get sick, right? entire point vaccinated right?


So care unvaccinated people get sick? problem anymore, theirs. low risk, first shot yesterday bearing side. I'm going stop living life (especially makes sense since I'm real danger)

That's anti-vaxx/masker's attitude whole time. Statistically, country ""no real danger"" without vaccine. weird project much compassion others support vaccine, ""really give 0 shits"" want it. actually care people? trying feel good self? I'm trying dick, genuine question. Thanks COVID-19... relapsed mine ugh home 24/7 food able go gym struggle fun? Even proper paperwork entirely up, there's good chance shipment would sit around customs low-level functionary bribed actually job. That‚Äôs hope lol *trend*! It‚Äôs briefly downward! can't tell sarcasm know that... what's irresponsible holding outdoor event 4 months now? Everyone possibly wants vaccine vaccinated then. really clear September 2022 2023 safer... might well cancel indefinitely?

I'm assuming logistics/bottom line civic responsibility. America, states offering pay people vaccine lol. see uptake low there

People UK would probably opposite pay government jab could mention generalities? say ‚Äúin general‚Äù? statement crystal clear, caveats made here. Vaccinated people carry virus. didn‚Äôt couch language all. getting info speaking generalities? tell.

Because everyone speaking every time always couches everything right? never misspoke? 

No scientist. None. Believe vaccines work 100%. single one.

Stop arguing bad faith. People tabloid, they're magazine happened top google. Here's Business insider reporting story. also ""misspoke"" said pregnant women get vaccine - one speaks perfectly every time. Stop trying pretend do. clear anyone two brain cells rub together nothing 100% - general - fine. **"" Shut eyes pretend last year happen already !"" amazes many people really believe best way forward.**

No country perfect, Singapore definitely isn't. things well one them.  complete fanny charge. Case closed, need call Scooby Gang one. Leadership. Patent protections. Pick one. argument usually ignores Schedule lists four plants without disclaimers use one. Ya we, school, mandate anything could possibly causing much harm students, **studies need urged conclusive** whether common mandatory vaccinations lead various common health disorders. 

(Emphasis mine)  need get rid government paying hospitalization due covid. Ideally make private insurance also doesn‚Äôt pay (unless vaccine medically can‚Äôt get it). people risking bankruptcy don‚Äôt want get vaccinated may change tune. explain plant AZ used EU production (until EU forced hand using second one last month) said they're even underperforming producing much they're contracted to? add up??  ""Safe"" certain number people vaccinated community spread low (as shown cases positivity rate). 

We getting there. things mention (other flu) considered addictions diseases. getting covid vaccine voluntary retardation. Sure, talking Florida unmasked indoor events right now, outdoor event four months. absolutely believe burning man would fine, also believe large scale indoor unmasked events US moment dumb fuck. don‚Äôt see views incompatible? crazy? Based what? New improved Covid spreads easily, affects younger people Covid 1.0, hits harder. Evolution action. think challenge becomes getting 80% herd immunity. Already we‚Äôre seeing decreased demand might enough keep virus going longer, increasing chances vaccine-resistant variant. 

The longer goes on, chances virus gets adapt.

You think contracts gives country first supply nationalism immoral. 

You indirectly claim EU morales contracts gave priority AZ vaccine.

But imply EU US UK UK US immoral. ultimately flaky morales throw others faces mean shit. hypocrit! mind EU something consider immoral.

Truth EU morales claim messed contracts. 

What would love. Enough vaccines every country enough supply. UK set punish EU. set make sure enough security contract supply. EU hand....... Internationally never eliminate virus. means travel restrictions / testing borders forever plan, worried theoretical variant. know part Germany friend lives, service workers talking about, rest country service workers wear masks. really. Many places asking people get medicine oxygen available black market point 10x inflation. ambulance services hospital, crematorium. 

Also vaccine won‚Äôt free large amount population unless wait really long time. Natural antibodies usually aren‚Äôt spike protein power induce immunity. 

Many people infected got reinfections. media people, people reacting COVID idea full FDA approval coming?  you‚Äôre waiting herd immunity get ready wait forever. Second dose could important duration vaccine. effectiveness first dose might last long two doses. could lead issues. Well why'd wait long say it?

(I DECLARE OVER!) *Michael Scott voice kids happy give vaccinations Dollywood! WASHINGTON: Covaxin, India's home-grown Covid-19 vaccine, found neutralise 617 variant deadly virus, White House chief medical adviser America's top pandemic expert Dr Anthony Fauci said here.

Fauci speaking reporters conference call Tuesday.""This something we're still gaining data daily basis. recent data, looking convalescent Sera Covid-19 cases people received vaccine used India, Covaxin. found neutralise 617 variants,"" said.""So, despite real difficulty we're seeing India, vaccination could very, important antidote this,"" Fauci added.The New York Times Tuesday said Covaxin works teaching immune system make antibodies SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

Wang Yi said sent invitation India ( however India didnot take part ) August tentative caveat include indoor mask mandate? CDC guidance says unvaccinated go unmasked outdoors well except larger, dense gatherings like concerts, etc., that‚Äôs apparently going far California. Less safe extent? Conversely: never ever would go event.  Yeah, well, Covid tired you. say that. LA County reported outbreaks kids/teens playing organized sports teams outdoors. California's public health admin also done breakdown professions highest covid rates since start pandemic, construction workers work primarily outdoors near top. outdoors Safer, proximity others much forgo masking influences infection rates. Best wishs NS! 

Damn wish could anything stop damned virus. Yeah well that's important factor. ant bee disregard values swarm. would someone motivated get vaccinated different restrictions someone isn't? 

Are proposing society becomes permanently held hostage percentage people want get vaccinated? Define ""best."" üòÇ get snow, summers absolutely brutal. part L.A. grew hit 121 last summer, 115 part live now.

That definitely undercount. Officials privately put 20-30x official reported number daily. significant portion population Louisiana live bumfuck there's another family within 20 miles let alone vaccination site pharmacy

I live one larger cities Louisiana know efforts reach rural parts state live everyone know getting vaccinated can. I've fully vaccinated like month Unless escape variant shows up, turns severely miscalculated effectiveness vaccine provides protection 3-4 months, pandemic September/October US. Brazil poor. wealth inequality ground little country's wealth whole massive corruption plaguing country. Brazil got shit together, could economic powerhouse. consistently appointments pharmacies throughout city suburbs. Three weeks ago booked within minutes made available. Supply isn‚Äôt due politics it‚Äôs simply due lack materials capacity produce said materials Lol yesss It‚Äôs funny cause wheee live Jackson county we‚Äôre put back extreme risk cause 300 cases one week. Yet father law hospital day said literally one hospital wasn‚Äôt busy. 150 million doses adminstered. states 25% overall 10%.

True help 3 months line would help. short term need oxygen. Thanks, didn‚Äôt realize CDC issued card. Appreciate help. Yeah, religious festival supper-spreading event. Good &amp; bad news today. Starting tomorrow southern (but done relatively well w restrictions) state removing mask mandate things. Healthcare settings, govt offices, public transport &amp; k-12/universities still require masks. private business. 

Me 5+ weeks post-2nd shot &amp; 2 week waiting period: HELLZ YEAH!!!

Me working household name retail private company: I'm *horrible* weeks

My store outbreak December (I vacation.) Entire store closed almost 2 weeks. Full HR/CDC investigation. HR serious it. remote &amp; check cameras. must require masks us &amp; customers. get &amp; appreciated workers &amp; customers alike. 

But state open season shots 16yr+ almost month. Supply exceeds demand. far know, 3 11 workers store shot (although pretty much everyone else natural immunity December incident.) 

I'm relatively ok w masks. trust vaccines. fact, I'm looking forward opportunity personal life move people's comfort level post-vaccine ""normalcy."" But...It's job require customers. I'm looking forward facing next days/weeks. call cops many times since last summer. know community &amp; workers catch hell. already heard visitors neighboring states ""my governor says wear one"" üôÑ

I say implore you..once mandates removed area, please aware workers may required enforce masking rules. nice us. though tough year (&amp; mask 40+hrs week.) business requires it..comply &amp; complain worker. zero control policy.

I'm excited see things *finally* start fall place. I'm excited front line drama Non vaccinated people dangerous all

I fully vaccinated, no, dangerous me. lack doses Unless escape variant shows up, severely miscalculated effectiveness vaccine provides protection 3-4 months, pandemic September/October US. India seems next hotspot. news whether current vaccines stop variant? new variant proliferating outside India? real question they?

Non vaccinated people dangerous I‚Äôm saying....why even say press release!!!! One could easily lead death, e.g. infecting immunocompromised kid young vaccines. Good. world every country coveted vaccines dont see possible lat√≠n american country could outbid EU/NA could many vaccinate 10M daily early vaccine production process, even India, China, US whole EU combined able day 5M vaccines applied. Roll nationwide. Go. Go. Go. ""Except crowded settings"" vague unhelpful.

Now CDC said it, plan EVER wearing mask outside rest life. someone tells authority so, keep spare one handy ""crowded setting"" totally subjective.

COVID over, CDC finally said it, god damn it. It‚Äôs standardized CDC, different state. Although provider ran couldn‚Äôt even provide card stock it‚Äôs like photocopied version printer paper.

It doesn‚Äôt really make sense can‚Äôt better day age, like happens lose it? gets torn, etc. knows long we‚Äôll expected hold onto them. I‚Äôd surprised didn‚Äôt work Europe, there‚Äôs much political pressure US kinds decisions.

I‚Äôm sure people absolutely fake vaccination cards, likely significant enough percentage matter. improvement? Received vaccine week ago really rough. got ringing ears today, it‚Äôs brutal. on-off chills headache also haven‚Äôt stopped. Keep mind even though India vaccines approved/deployed mRNA ones (Pfizer/Moderna). proven extremely effective. universe hates us, people want pretend like over. think downvotes cute, kinda people want venues.  children go public school unless parents rich enough pay private there‚Äôs functionally choice involved. heard people still getting COVID vaccinations new variant. anyone data references this?

This India story feels like Wuhan Jan 2020, it‚Äôs far away can‚Äôt feel it, looks like another wave coming next months spread globally? reach 25% would 325 million doses population. Sorry say, vaccination isn‚Äôt going really anything help situation now. Covid spreading exponentially there. They‚Äôre causing demonstrable harm. Tennessee never reach 75% population vaccinated, even close it.  Yep, 39 got 2nd dose last Thursday Moderna. Glad part solution. I'm concerned myocarditis per data reported. concerned weaponizing non-story w/ anti-vaccination agendas.  
 
Hey, lose sense taste smell long term that's prefer. Play games. I'm sure anyone would value opinion someone *didn't* experience pain subjected experiments ok cool?

It always really strange false equivalency hang anti-vax hat on; Tuskegee Experiments conducted local pharmacies mass vaccination sites literally everyone encouraged attend. want believe conspiracy theories covid vaccine whatever two situations analogous way Nah, see lasting long. anything, likely till mid-summer. ""on interpreter"". people w/ agendas methods amplify conspiracies. important note basically message forum anyone enter whatever want. Oh, get card. handwritten card would different state? Yikes probably won‚Äôt get flight Europe. It‚Äôll interesting see plays coming months. Meh, we‚Äôre well Wisconsin time need second shot event, easy get one. I've heard, NYC Mayor imply would months mask mandate held indoors, kinda imply maybe midsummer (August) they'll take off. know lot people sub don‚Äôt want hear this, think lot places hold large gatherings till next year. 

Partly give vaccine time work see escape variants show next months. Partly need plan advance don‚Äôt want spend ton money cancel there‚Äôs spike cases. Many organizations might decide it‚Äôs early vaccination process talk return large gatherings wait till next year. Looking forward something like rolled nationally. much easier standardized version add one layer reassurance that's safe.

Make happen. opposed attempts curtail executive emergency power past year, think powers limits imo we're quickly reaching limits.

Honestly, reached limits 10 months ago.

There's nothing wrong emergency declarations per se, legislatures need put big boy/girl pants take action. delegate authority governor. Either fine.

What ok governors passing 60-day 60-day 60-day emergency declaration. kind interpretation nonsensical. legislature wanted governors able pass indefinite emergency declarations, include 60 day time limit. similar I've thinking. live Northwest Indiana, much ""blue"" rest state. county, however, total mixed bag. Right we're 30% elligible population fully vaccinated 15% partially vaccinated. point, stall around 50% vaccination, okay that. I'm 27 and, anecdotally, none peers previously covid vaccinated, peers it. know can't add number cases number folks vaccinated see level immunity there's obviously overlap, current risk assessment, feels pretty close. assume 30% county population covid (18k confirmed cases x 3 conservative estimate true cases comes 30% county's pop), addition fact age demographic cases, i'm feeling pretty confident safety fully vaccinated person. I'm going karaoke crowded bar birthday two days, i'm pumped af. many variables play right now, covid math confusing kind math. think areas country seeing vaccine hesitancy probably saved previous lack caution. Fingers crossed, anyway. hit sweet spot 50-60% vaccinated within 6-8 month range highest number covid cases (so, May-July county) think we'll good. 1/2 vaxxed Tennessean, firmly attest guy negligent calendar year now, local news comment sections chock full of:

1) ""Vaccinations kill us all.""
2) ""Covid bad cold.""
3) ""I personally know 128 people died vaccine, 347 others died something Covid hospital put wrong CoD death certificate. still know anyone who's died Covid.""
4) [Enter Braveheart-esque quotes pertaining masks here] cheering virus? good look, bro. Americans really don‚Äôt like tracked. states experimenting electronic proof vaccination (NY think), part roof vaccination card. date/lot number/location/name/date birth.

States record it‚Äôs publicly accessible database request proof from.

I think travel card probably sufficient countries since world won‚Äôt particularly high tech. mRNA vaccines show substantial protection two week mark *the first shot*‚Äî80%.

You week five days *second shot* point. immune, catch COVID, even rare chance symptoms would minimal nonexistent. need take test, definitely need quarantine! I'm sure backfire ever.... hope wrong decrease

We wait see guess

When got second shot many people first time opened day compared afternoon first shot  much chance getting virus get vaccinated, wear mask social distance.  alter variables, risk goes up. Hahaha WTF noooo. see mean. teacher glad schools require it. students vaccinated already :) supply issues Tennessee, everyone wants shot get it. don‚Äôt making conscious decision expose risks. People die, can‚Äôt punish vaccinated sake unvaccinated everyone chance make decision themselves. True, dependent independent variable Yeah, based headline picture, initially thought trying catch it, thought one crazy deniers. Panic.is normal Yikes! 25%? No, no, no, that's WAY soon! asking mask mandate pulled back restrictions mean low percentage. Better wait number higher, like 75%. absolutely reckless take gas pedal now. least 2 states (Wisconsin Michigan) respective state supreme courts invalidate emergency declarations. Honest question Canuck. Canada provincial health authorities provide record vaccine had, date, even batch number tracking. bring info health portal online, presumably doctor could well. USA seems more...hodgepodge? central agency federally state level keeps track vaccinated, date, etc? I‚Äôm wondering American would prove fully vaccinated travel to, say, Canada Europe. Especially Florida so-called vaccine passports (proof vaccination) banned. I'm sure religious/medical exemptions. There‚Äôs lot that. Like mentioned, spreads higher likelihood mutations evade vaccines hit kids harder. would think less 1/3 kids infected transmission seems better among adults schools overall using prevention measures well many virtual learning. Conspiracy theorists don‚Äôt need ammo. endless supply. doubt, make new one. I‚Äôm personally concerned getting two weeks post second dose can‚Äôt express household without causing argument point. 


Everyone family least one dose point, we‚Äôll presumably fully vaccinated second week June. feel like I‚Äôm difficult conversation June comes around. want respect concerns, also don‚Äôt want hunker another year either. Florida one states still reporting persistent epidemic. daily confirmed cases Texas twice many California. death reporting erratic still pace ~ 1800 confirmed per month, despite high risk elderly vaccinated beginning January.

This last state holding mass events. overlay data last year year. Unbelievable much better year last year date. near 60k hospitals last year (only 3/5th states reporting back then) less 40k. 2,000 dying day, we‚Äôll 700. continue continue improve here. anticipate next test late June southern states surged last year, fare time? I‚Äôm going guess fine, bump nothing even come remotely close filling hospitals. We're oxygen people dying result.

Oh, that's important enough.... remember told would 95 97% effective. remember math? Louisiana significant decrease vaccine uptake lately, referring vaccine doses initiated (first doses) Alabama Mississippi lower percentage Louisiana. Louisiana 32%, Alabama 31.8%, Mississippi 30.6%. Texas 37.4% Florida 40.8%. national average 42.7%.

Source: added source Man, sometimes don‚Äôt get people. live country isn‚Äôt vaccinating enough. I‚Äôm straight male would literally suck dick get jab point.  Again, look US. passed cases per capita. That's vaccines working. incredible spread infection vaccine rollout. Yet states lifting mask mandates, people attending sporting events, 42% population one dose 29% 2. 

Her numbers make absolutely sense. extreme. wrong many times throughout pandemic one making decisions start lifting restrictions. assume full FDA approval workplaces schools start requiring it, way even liberal states mandate vaccination RI walk appointments starting mass vax centers. worth ""62% approval"" rating? That's what's happening rest world right now. hear you, thanks respectful. thought complete equivalency extremes, one group overly cautious isolating reducing exposure (too much, course), whereas likely infect others cause demonstrable harm.  People forget millions protested summer, outdoors masks similar this. Granted, zero cases basically concert every day months. 

So answer question, yes could maksed concerts. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Anything interesting? Yes, assume third kids got too. get 200 300 pediatric deaths, then, thousands. That‚Äôs different one year pneumonia flu. it‚Äôs likely least healthy kids earlier death set. gov offer cash incentive plus 'lottery ticket' encourage vaccination. shot winning big prize million dollars lots lower prizes $1,000 plus would go long way push people towards getting vaccinated. mean president telling people wearing masks ‚Äúfor sissies‚Äù also probably didn‚Äôt help....  *Way* cautious. They're gonna regret this, I'm sure it. [CDC lot stuff, including gathering maskless vaccinated people. loved response, thanks sharing. Great way think situation. We‚Äôre literally talking 3-4 months now. raging pandemic US time, there‚Äôs nothing it. need present negative test enter country, vaccines available anybody wants it. sorry meant US close 80% immunity much world 10% people US matters. right decision self evident soon. Deaths declining 2 months Israel studied mRNA outcomes quite good even newer strains. might get sick newer strains still way less likely need hospital care. ‚ÄúSome spoken said vaccinated twice still got seriously ill, bad sign.‚Äù

What make this? even though vaccine effective, certain groups, immunocompromised, cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, might develop less effective immune response it, herd immunity vaccination important, protect populations vaccine effective. That's vaccines mandated school, protect individual rather population student body(and faculty staff). need personal incentive reasoning, less favorable conditions virus(ie: everyone vaccinated)means less chance developing ways escape immune system overcome vaccine aquired immunity. good portion I've known plenty normal people went. course assholes ones get attention though.  got first shot Finland Monday, second scheduled 12 weeks out. they're stretching current limited supply that. hahahahhaha allowing another one happen soon. I've seen estimates half billion total infected. 2% 10 million dead would assume hospital collapse.

GOP.still gonna act like overreacted last year. FYI ferritin numbers COVID patients normal India. one knows GQP done protect compromised people can't take vaccines? think actual organization event, especially suppliers infrastructure sub-contractors. It‚Äôs crazy amount work put event tens thousands people dry lake bed remote north western Nevada. Usually soon one ends, already planning next event, working suppliers well federal, state, local governments. 

The Burning Man Org basically all-year government fairly large city actually exists week year. 

I don‚Äôt think could make happen little lead time go / go call. Officials privately put 20-30x official reported number daily.

And wonder even modest assumption.  Yeah Coronavirus bad long hospitals cont collapse. frankly luckily something like hit early 20th century.

Pneumonia killer. 5-10% coronavirus infected needing hospital care seeing India bullet dodged. hospitals fill up, 02 ventilators run out, mortality rate quickly climbs. modern medicine true mortality coronavirus would higher. Perhaps 2x. 3x.

It's warning world. Good God. That's 6-12 MILLION infections day. month avg 270M cases, would quarter India. vaccines going make real dent 2-3 months even ramped up.

The coming death rate could rate seen anywhere case oxygen supplies get truly outstripped. That's always biggest risk - many cases area even treatable cases anymore due supply. case noticed there's huge pandemic still ongoing entire world. ends kinds events safe. Vaccination produce instant results, especially enough people vaccinate. many people understand light switch flip everything goes back normal. virus work like that. Really? fact based science something think happened becatit fits narrative? infection young people India could also fact average age India 27 cases rise, rise cases young people natural well. 

Or new variant killing young people? like Pfizer Forum amirite Amazing news. I'm fully vaccinated American dying finally see cross-border family friends Canada. wear mask willing quarantine. Vaccine passports definitely required international travel. obligated travel internationally anyways. Come Biden, send vaccines neighbors north! See summer, grandma :) entirely depend whether virus still easily spreading society not. Vaccines supposed eventually end constant spread virus due R dropping 0, even though everyone vaccinated chances mass outbreak end really small time goes on. takes long time get everyone vaccinated, that's especially case children 16 unvaccinated carriers virus. That's huge demographic problem. 

So forever, certainly near future prudent cancel events like these. Vaccination going adequate September. might worst strawman argument ever read website. feel bad it, feel especially bad using it. Whose motive? know means. I'm implying current medical scientific consensus masking outdoors especially vaccinated mostly performative, extremely low risk regardless mask mask. Therefore matter personal preference perfectly reasonable scientific understanding changed COVID first appeared. implying I'm anti-mask? you.  It‚Äôs ridiculously easy decide home school kids. people good reasons well. rest pretty much nut jobs.  look way, Latin American could shit hole socialist governments 70's-80's one government put forth regulations prevent essential services requiring it. 

Grocery shopping high risk crowded, potentially maskless concert. case years come. going cancel forever? Oh good... wait, what? This. Carrot stick. Also even someone vaccinated still get sick, it‚Äôs usually much less severe, could still land hospital. case they‚Äôre still fucked? 

Hard pass. better ways get shots arms leaning even already fucked healthcare system. j&amp;j? Ok? never large events again? There‚Äôs point take risk unvaccinated people going large events, otherwise events never happen risk accepted. recommended receive 2nd dose vaccine first dose apparently caused thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy. dad received first dose Sinovac (Chinese) platelets dropped significantly significant increase Dimer levels first dose vaccine. subsequently recovered concerned 2nd dose now.

Any literature would also appreciated. Thanks daughter 15 years old. runner, slim fairly athletic. caught covid almost year ago barely take shower without passing out. It‚Äôs impossible. preventable prevent it. don‚Äôt understand people upset people trying get sick. live everything open ask wear mask. It‚Äôs literally easiest thing do. What‚Äôs big deal?

I done absolutely downplaying pandemic. question subjectivity self assessment: get tested, quarantine, save lives; book flight, travel world, hug every stranger see, sneeze salad bar. sick enough can't get vaccine, plenty things could easily kill covid? :o funny That's problem event tons people get together weeks time. would tons unvaccinated people going. actually talking 985, I'm talking south/central parts 318 north/central 337. East Natchitoches Alexandria, west Mississippi. Think places like Jena. parts state drive 30 miles even see traffic light even towns stop light necessarily pharmacies Congrats! got second today. We'll get there, tend agree going lot longer find ways overcome vaccine hesitancy. No. lack leadership many people living religious gatherings like life normal. Similar Belgium (40% infected, 25% vaccinated). Yet number cases still pretty high. 

I think article convinces me. Eh that's worst thing. Vaccines highly effective UK variant due variants high infectiousness keep variants getting large footholds like SA Brazil. People forget take account people spend time inside looking stat. numbers outside would lower even chance getting infected same.

In words - less people get infected violet buildings buildings color mean safer building violet. :) realize Chicago even top ten dangerous cities US, right? live Austin, it‚Äôs pretty even split. However, walking around neighborhood one day reverently masked couple saw (I wasn‚Äôt wearing mask) immediately ran side road. I‚Äôve thought ridiculous require masks outdoors, especially you‚Äôre taking walk. Overall, new guidance doesn‚Äôt change much here. Same. ashamed stupid taking COVID lightly. Sorry English first language.

What un-vaxed mean?  1st dose number important ""fully vaccinated"" number. UK pursued 1 dose strategy worked well. entirety population though, whereas adults. bit go.

Deaths around 1500 day less 20 day honest, Indians started pretend global pandemic. Holi, large indian festivals involving mass migration mixing millions, political rally without social distancing, open cinema, nightclub big sporting events crowds allowed far back beginning April.

Even current exponential rise cases, still national lockdown. 

Yes shame what's happening india jow honestly weeks ago watching rest world suffer stop take note. get summer. way, seroprevalence studies vastly overestimated results anyway. See India Manaus. really think mask wearing rules different vaccinated unvaccinated people.

Maybe I'm Europe, here, that's really controversial. country, medical masks already required grocery stores, public transport, etc, antigen testing becoming lot common, possible could pull wanted open mass event. Everyone refuses wear mask/get tested would able attend and/or get kicked out. issue people wearing mask refusing get tested, happens, people entrance going say, ""well, nice trip home, then"". 

That said, certainly lot less risky vaccination rates high enough Haha, yes, admit get chuckle people guzzling back ridiculous amount fried food alcohol suddenly care much much worry health.   really think mask wearing rules different vaccinated unvaccinated people. 

Otherwise general rule outline makes sense.

What happened subreddit? Still seeing daily cases 2,000 although much better sure, really gone past 2 weeks so. Pretty much stayed 2,000 3,000.

Fingers crossed soon see abatement ! turns travellers South Africa actually already banned prior announcement months. applicable restrictions changed way whatsoever. case relation basically every country Europe, yet 6-10% new cases France B1.351 infections. substantially number daily infections caused B1.351 South Africa. is, fact, entirely possible France active cases caused B1.351 SA moment. Europe whole certainly does, approximately 3.7% active cases driven particular variant.

South Africans subject travel bans approximately 120 countries, close impossible infections caused traipsing around Europe infecting people. common transit destinations also inaccessible airlines Emirates yet resume flight services country.

Travel restrictions South Africans evidently wildly unsuccessful ridding Europe variant. However, whenever surge cases caused B1.351, travel restrictions unnecessarily reemphasised South Africans unfairly scapegoated.

If going continue apply, insist doubling upon, stringent restrictions South Africa prevent spread B1.351, less 20,000 active cases, little reason treat French travellers exactly way. calm based replies post we‚Äôre pretty f-ed. Except you‚Äôre that‚Äôs vaccines work especially variants tested against. not, that's point. That's like saying die auto accident driver drunk hit you, fault? Dumb. would harm good uptake levels high. expected 75% uptake got around 95% risk groups

Whilst predicted decrease move age groups nobody predicting worryingly low

Making mandatory would unnecessary counter productive one hand, comments clearly wrong need correcting.

On other, preventing hospitalisations always main point vaccines first place. Cases rising problem leads increased hospital admissions.

I watched week ago, iirc, it‚Äôs much likely it‚Äôll become something like flu need regular annual shots. course, flu much manageable COVID point. estimates 70%. far suppliers go, Burning Man far fewer regular festival, since organisers provide restrooms, ice coffee. Everything else brought participants themselves.

BM still needs ton coordination build roads, basic infrastructure (medical points, etc), suppliers traditional festival sense (booze, food, music scenes) handled :) literally Merkel predicted January. levels required herd immunity covid's R number? living Krakow, 44% adults vaccinated one dose. month ago place ICUs. Wales vaccinated larger % I've seen estimation 4 10 Poland, wave falling rapidly now. We'll see goes. Reaching 7 10 take many antivaxxers here. doctor friend told mortality rate would much higher, even young people, without oxygen. hospitalized COVID cases receive oxygen - without oxygen, hospitalizations would likely quickly turn ICU cases many would lead death, even among young healthy.

Granted - young people require oxygen, many do, country could easily see mortally rate 1% without adequate oxygen supplies.  might closer .2% 40, may 2-4% 60. Disappointed India Brazil. could let cases explode way? much needless loss life potential nasty variants.  It‚Äôs shown outdoor transmission low doubt rallies religious meets driving hugely. 

Uh Indian outdoors slightly different. looks like risk low situations low density, cases like this. CDC recommends 6-feet plus distancing even outdoors. 

The place festival held seen [1800% increase continue rise. 

The festival got yesterday, although significantly fewer people. spike-based vaccines exempt potential issue? Slovakia calling. Statement Slovak national drug regulator accurate. Due political disputes (politacally Sputnik YES/NO) political statement. first wrong version flied world. questioning days nobody cares result was:

14 14 provided safety lab test OK - issues 
Statement tested Sputnik V Slovakia different specifications chracteristics Sputnik V trials Lancet journal exaggerated.

At end difference packaging (2 doses vs 5 doses trial). Nothing more.

Formally state regulator right, different Sputnik V Lancet ussually pharma regulator evaulate every packaging separately new drug. wrong talking specifications even storage condition. -18 C.

Final statement was: 
*""We national regulator prepared complex evalution new vaccines. competance European medicine agency.* 
*As far try knov due lack documentation Russian producer lack evidence long term safety, reccomend Sputnik V general vaccination without proper registration EMA.""*

There proof insecurity even hazardous elements Sputnik V delivered Slovakia. 
But true is, Russian side disprove opposite, prooved safety delireved product, mostly safety production.

Something like Brazilian ANVISA: dont proof safety safe. (this correct). 
But saying adenovirus could replicated without proof fair correct maybe even true. official report page 7 - proof adenovirus replicated (nobody examined) therefore adenovirus Sputnik COULD replicate. 
This true without proof. That's even remotely true. Wtf. precisely annoyed much ""low fatality rate"" camp. ""low"" hospitals cope demand. soon someone progresses point needing oxygen (let alone ventilator) , could easily wind dead, turning 1% fatality rate (or whatever is) something much much higher... Oh wait, better one: one vax center took relatives too, distributed sweets.

People took masks off, munched like sad cows. One guy looked right eyes could feel brain cells dying.

The airline, one Taiwan's largest, reported several COVID-19 cases past week, though source infections remains unclear.

On Tuesday, CECC found three CAL pilots tested positive coronavirus' antibodies record infected disease, began test close contacts.

Two family members two pilots tested positive COVID-19 Wednesday.

One woman 40s, teenage boy, CECC said.

These new cases seen family clusters CECC conducting tests see people infected.

The third domestic case reported Wednesday man 70s, brother previously reported COVID-19 case.

After man's brother tested positive COVID-19 early April, helped deliver food sister-in-law, confirmed disease Tuesday.

Besides three domestic cases, Taiwan also recorded three new imported cases, bringing total number cases country 1,116 since outbreak began early 2020.

Only losers want continue longer absolutely necessary Exactly, smallpox emergency, plentiful supply vaccines it, Covid, would Covid emergency now

ps. Philadelphian pharmacy yesterday threw away 1000 unused Pfizer shots want forever wear facemask guest force everyone else follow path poor risk might take 5-30% chance getting virus (depending vaccine) reduce 0.001% chance. 

efficacy numbers equal percentage change catching virus way Government hiding data.. Real death approx 4 times more. People waiting queue cremation loved ones. There's single family suffered loss.  that's true, shown natural antibodies plus one moderna pfizer equivalent shots. would've nightmare implement scale large US, see we'll hit herd immunity 50 percent.

It's 4th one changed admitting denying it. Kind impressive.

They say time 600,000 dead americans almost every country better poorest exceptions. I've said elsewhere true fda approval happens, guess there's going lots businesses organizations going make vax mandatory employment, entry, etc. Sorry meant respectüòÇit‚Äôs early brain still broken. common covid, anyone vaccines called ""anti-vaxxer"" don‚Äôt understand effectiveness rates work  Thanks sharing, quite informative write up. UK enough doses Moderna yet self reported side effect data meaningful. Maybe month so. courtesy? Biden wearing mask outside walking podium outside white house vaccinated take talk crowd 20 feet away (again outside) tell Americans wear mask outside crowds.

This fuel anti-maskers, nothing stunt made sense. could celebratory moment going saying ""I got vaccinated, outside (not crowd) wear mask, follow lead"" classic centrist dems though, can't make single decision makes sense point everyone wants vax, access large amount people least first shot. time convince people fence/younger crowd get release this. basically telling everyone still need mask youre vaccinated unless youre outside yourself/with family. youre outside strangers, mask up! even studies show outdoor transmissions low. chance show people get vaccinated, theyll little freedom states, nothing changed. dont require masks outside am, want put youre passing others outside. understand masks indoors cant socially distance, outdoors masking fully vaccinated bit crazy. anti vaxxers wont get regardless, really screwed pooch time need convince fence. Zero. Even radical policies put place vaccinate everyone virus still remain transmissible animals people vaccines (well, really immune systems) perfect. endemic virus like flu is. like flu always constant threat new variant pop escapes vaccines. That's always constant threat flu too. That's Swine Flu pandemic was. variant H1N1. Avian Flu variant H5N1 others. And, hopefully least decade two now, COVID variant causes major concern normal vaccine updates can't handle. fun stupid! Only? 1 4 seems high number this. Edit ""only"" headline. happens someone gets sick attacked? Wtf venn diagram circle one rainbow bridge cremation goodest boi‚Äôs mostly right, 18 also catching it, likely decent rate given infections tend pretty minor. we've got 70% adults therefore 56% population (as 20% population 18). There's likely relative deficit made due vaccines, must pretty damn close. dosing already used treat viruses often provides greater protection. CDC say ""vaccinated adults longer need wear mask"" children age 16 need wear mask public indoor spaces.

enough must wear mask vaccinated bullshit Bartender, another round boilermaker oh dunno, let‚Äôs go Funyuns time. Thanks Yeah it‚Äôs mostly sign respect. Basically saying ‚ÄúI respect want stay healthy‚Äù No, wrong. can‚Äôt look total deaths. literally go look CDC‚Äôs estimates IFR, assume use seasonal influenza IFR estimates. 

For anyone age 40, CDC estimates IFR ~0.02%. CDC says 20-49 0.05%. 18, IFR around 0.002%. Bad seasonal influenza strains higher IFR rates either those. stop spreading That‚Äôs wicked cool personally feel might want research start spreading falsehoods. get kits test home office too. went see client first time year covid test got office. doubt? asymptomatic? (Parents lying attributing symptoms normal snotty nose etc)? Unfortunately going increase buy much past waves, still millions vaccinated Hell yeah sign Johnson Johnson vaccine best record safety sued giving cancer women ""we've tried nothing ideas"" county vaccine popup brewery.

Get shot get free drink.

This seems like good way get shots younger people. Yeh same. lots news covid spreading rapidly schools re-opened UK, stands reason high number kids antibodies. We're already low double figures, hopefully we'll zero days soon getting downvoted? would help get context. Sure, sure. pigs flying alongside Boeing Airbus common occurrence per manifesto. *dibs There's reason walking around mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony fauci Yeah wild many Facebook commenters personally know written death certificates random acquaintances theirs. all, public knowledge. understand point little better. Thanks clarification. fucking clue you‚Äôre downvoted. map current statistics case rate, cases, deaths hospitalisations we‚Äôre exponentially lower last July fully opened hospitality indoors. 

From didn‚Äôt see significant uptick numbers start September. we‚Äôre approaching herd immunity, incredibly successful vaccination programme numbers amazing yet government still isn‚Äôt guaranteeing restrictions end Summer. includes social distancing measures. Seems crazy me. Question regards vaccine-induced immunity. Hope dumb question articulate well.

If vaccine said eficacy neighborhood 95%, like Pfizer, understand mean vaccinated group infected rate 95% less unvaccinated folks. 

For people still get infected i.e. ""breakthrough"" infections, likely attributed fact people robust immune response immune response vaccine (so personal issue vaccine physiology), likely took risk still got infected anyway due amount coronavirus likely exposed (habits environment)? both?

In words, assuming vaccines reduce/eliminate spread believe vaccine-induced immunity, personal behavior matter much relation risk? speaking immediate life threatening cases, speaking unknown long term effects. work public schools heard students got covid november sense taste/smell still April. 

Friends mine 30s 40s otherwise healthy lung damage heart conditions covid. would risk it? Never ceases amaze sub lol yeah, like old saying goes, lead horse water, can't make drink. people, they're never going take matter much convincing do. confirmed cases flu year coronavirus cases.Think it.

So many people say I've started replying. ""Okay, I've thought it. now?"" watch squirm explain whatever dumb correlation thought implying. willing (18 above) give informed consent get AstraZeneca vaccine get COVID-19 vaccine earlier. Meanwhile, hesitant stay regular line wait turn Pfizer-BioNTech Sinovac vaccine.

Also whole ‚Äústay home save grandma‚Äù flawed can‚Äôt grandma stay home? Ok. hell people allowed maskless outdoors? Lol. dumb. never enforced. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve seen past infection prevents future infection 80%.

Oh, Spain cases mask deniers rather anecdotical historically great degree vaccine acceptance. Currently rate people 80 vaccinated 100% (because calculated January 2021 census demographic grown bit), meaning virtually 80s accepted vaccine. demographics still vaccinated, following path 62% growing daily 4-5%)

In case, someone refuses get tested wear mask, fine: access event. honestly believe safe indoor trade shows inside hotel ballrooms again?

STUPID SHIT

But yea, keep voting republican TN. Way go. also can't eating raw cookie dough! one drink per day.

In reality, one following expert advice everything. often extremely idealistic. Full effectiveness achieved approx 2 weeks second dose vaccine. don‚Äôt agree. started preventing hospitals collapsing instead preventing people catching Covid non-exponential rate. moved pretty quickly though, learned catching Covid often really bad, even don‚Äôt die get sick need hospitalized. That‚Äôs flatten curve became take long term efforts prevent spread. Personally, risk long Covid reason family basically stayed last 14 months, it‚Äôs even vaccinated won‚Äôt associate indoors unmasked unvaccinated people. Personally people I‚Äôve dealt work (I‚Äôm stylist constant contact lot people) would say Moderna higher that. I‚Äôd say 80% people including who‚Äôve feeling pretty rough next day second shot. Obviously day feeling like crap much worth compared getting actual virus. Many people I‚Äôve spoken Pfizer really reaction sore arm. personal experience world. Yeah. Seatbelts bullshit since car airbags! Yeah know. lot people say asymptomatic symptoms dismissed (headache etc) trying clarify that‚Äôs commenter doubted (the asymptomatic part) doubted many kids tested positive studied set (which like think studies authors made something?) means are... using dog crematorium? Correct generally agree long young kids (&lt;1 year old) involved. infant / toddler, probably wear mask even vaccinated. vaccinated people 5-30 percent chance getting virus. need know need book day work also *possible* variants good evading vaccines used US. sequencing studying variants takes long time time time find nasty variant probably late much it.

Having everyone wear masks community transmission stops really good way hedge one showing spreading explosively. retrospect thing last February . India going significantly worse Italy, Belgium, UK go worse, really bad themselves. means awesome would punch old antimasker face number comes people gotten COVID post-vaccination divided total number people vaccinated nice number look at, accurate. get actual percentage contracting COVID post-vaccination, divide number vaccinated people **who exposed** number vaccinated one really knows that.

The real number somewhere 5% 0.007% we'll never know certain. Disinformation stupidity happened ü§îü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è dumb. phrased differently:

Only 1 4 people experienced side effects like headache, fatigue, chills shiver, diarrhoea, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea. others reported experiencing localized side effects. Don‚Äôt forget grocery deliverer at
Risk. cares poors, amirite? true. temporary herd immunity reached, primary goal vaccination. think 12-15 huge approved. Parents obviously roadblock, kids shit (source: I'm high school) enthusiastic quarantine virtual school anymore. 

Sports big spreader, middle-high school age vaccinated help us ton Exponential decay, high peak good read. Yes that‚Äôs point, cases England going may lead death many waves, government even said expect I‚Äôm really sure asking here. know viruses mutate, rates depend virus itself. mutations beneficial virus, fact it‚Äôs small percentage, are. Now, 1000 new cases per day vs 1,000,000 new cases per day numbers mutations occurring daily basic increases chance mutation beneficial virus. mutations accumulate spike protein vaccine efficacy reduced.

This isn‚Äôt fear mongering saying everything needs locked avoid this, it‚Äôs honestly basic virology probability. Still includes 1.5 million first jabs believe, ground halt feared start month *Officially.

There‚Äôs way haven‚Äôt already far exceeded America‚Äôs recorded numbers. countries give second Pfizer/Moderna shot 3/4 weeks, others 6 weeks. wonder side effects stronger less time shots? many people spend much time worrying side effects? feel like worrying, especially social media, spread needless doubt worry vaccines.

The reality is, side effects either non-existent, extremely mild, extremely temporary, article shows. 

Even read article, us point know people lives, including perhaps ourselves, vaccine. felt side effects. felt sore arm. felt tired achey. lasted day two. like OP's article says.

I'm complete wuss, felt mild tiredness acheyness, asked dozen coworkers friends acquaintances, never would've mentioned it. nothing, *almost* nothing. seems experience 90% people.

Yet social media, see facebook twitter posts friends randoms posting side effect worries, terribly worrisome thing.

What reality people living in?
 
My explanation asking vaccine side effects become new small talk version ""How weather?"" People lonely bored want create conversation. also humble brag. ""Hey got vaccine early...but totes worried side effects!""

With huge portion population worried taking vaccine all, pro-vaccine people flooding social media pointless worry posts?!? /rant use crematorium both? 4 6 respectively. wear it, would fuel anti-maskers. can't live life based group crazies think actions. joke... kid but, Covid. started lot tooth pain apparent infection turned fever. went doctor's prescribed antibiotic tooth throat infection. said monitor symptoms and, changed go away, would tested Covid. 3 days later informed close contact positive case returned test. came back positive. symptoms kept developing following week.  
I always though tooth pain bad luck hindered potential diagnosis Covid, time also wonder whether two things could related all. English slang becomes English time. Dictionaries guides English, prescriptive governing body (unlike French, etc) mean ‚Äúnot worth going jail‚Äù? Tricky question there‚Äôs time component well.  get R0 1 likely less 70%, won‚Äôt eliminate things anytime soon Nah they're really. They've stagnated. Two weeks! Right, yet announced okay. 

I know anti-mask anti-vaxx crowd operates largely bad faith oversights add fuel fire. course 80% great. I'm saying 70% infected/vaccinated may enough achieve herd immunity.  wear sunscreen every time go outside? always cook steak least medium? Maybe feel need tell world health? No, anti vaccine conspiracy theorists effectively taken messaging (which admittedly poor) weaponized it. Well, lets try enormous packed political rallies, religious festivals attracting millions people, then. Well exactly putting bodies doggie crematorium. making use land burn platform humans. Good see this! states either decent shape new cases trending sharply downward right now. Hoping means deaths continue decline. think big test seeing low get new cases go. California best state right now, around 4.9 daily new cases/100k people. Hopefully number get lower US cases overall dip dip down. There‚Äôs company called Ocugen that‚Äôll likely filing EUA soon produce Covaxin. rights outside India manufacture landed $100 million investment help facilitate logistics manufacturing. vaccine studies suggesting, could joining moderna, Pfizer J&amp;J lineup shortly. mean, makes sense. respectful way treat remains still space-efficient. Based social media thought 99.5% people bad side effects.

Exhibit 4,321: Social media reflective real life. Get people vaccinated things stop getting pushed back cancelled. restrictions cancellations 100% fault people refusing get vaccinated.  I'm onboard best practices but...eating mask on. Arizona? Socal hitting 100 handful times summer seems pretty palatable imo. Limiting outdoor gatherings even tho know virus can‚Äôt spread easily outside üòë herd immunity!...soon hope anyway completely anecdotal, second moderna shot 22nd. around 28-30 hours second dose felt body aches, chills. check temp, think fever. possible could one, want find cause i'd felt like i'd talk feeling worse. overall, flu 2-3 years ago vaccine side effects hold candle feeling went 5 days. honestly let potential side effects deter getting it, plan second day discomfort, get side effects, working. not, hell yeah! 100% worth ridiculous sound. Indians east split hairs, snotty nose would symptom. mild cold-like symptom would throw person ‚Äúsymptomatic‚Äù category. Asymptomatic carriers literally physical symptoms. purpose passes protect people venue. incentivize people get vaccinated participate events want to.

""I ate sandwich, people still starving Africa?"" two related, answer questions. you‚Äôre vaccinated moment, cases dropping fast. still highest rate daily new infections country pretty wide margin (51.4 cases per 100k people--New Jersey currently second place 30.6). numbers least heading right direction now. Last couple sundays single figure believe.   husband got Pfizer, reaction, even sore arms. sister husband got AZ extremely ill, completely laid out, three days. flu symptoms except difficulty breathing. 
 
Lol that‚Äôs two four! Well looks like good thing. Would getting two shot influenza vaccine good thing? mean, things called open-access journals, sites like arXiv sharing research. Way better massive anti-vax platform known Facebook. doesn‚Äôt holding one late summer/ early fall seem extremely reckless?

Maybe it‚Äôs anxiety. went interaction social life year going full trade show? dunno got downvoted common sense lol. stayed locked March/April2020 fully vaccinated. people know.  Indian population much younger USA.

I think may surprised What's wrong letting everyone choose whether want protected? Smart. remember reading CDC said unmasked fully vaxxed unvaxxed fine providing it‚Äôs small group one high risk (indoors). I‚Äôm you, wouldn‚Äôt chance it. people ever continue quote? 

‚ÄúWhen think masks think health care providers needing them, people ill. I‚Äôm it, want it. lead shortage people really need it.‚Äù

This year ago, people front lines proper PPE. needed ensure doctors nurses masks want people hoarding really wanted everyone stay houses. Highly doubtful. chart sexist. expect get past it? sure expected‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd obvious get past matter Even unvaccinated never 100% chance catching covid interaction infected person. Friend mine wife catch basically assumed inevitable him. Got tested week later came back negative, took antibody test months later curiosity came back negative. eventually caught 6 months her. End year would happen Pfizer stops deliver proven dangerous. Even Pfizer Moderna enough doses fully vaccinate every adult end August. Yes still leaves room lot infections. I'm way saying need vaccines!! Guess didn‚Äôt read last 9 words comment.  answer question 'Bolsonaro', paying attention. There‚Äôs definitive answer regarding effectiveness vaccines recent virulent variants, ravaged developing countries worldwide. keep wearing masks. eventually better understanding likely breakthrough infections risk breakthrough infection causing long Covid. also hopefully get spread low risk becomes negligible. Everything always evolving, absolute statements aren‚Äôt reasonable. say willing right now. 

The one absolute statement make done people didn‚Äôt take pandemic seriously forever. learned values don‚Äôt mesh people really fundamental level I‚Äôm putting ever again. [From I've previous infections protect much vaccinations. study would indicate otherwise? also get infected vaccinated risk serious disease much much lower. Yea see that. There‚Äôs also something getting first jab thinking don‚Äôt wear mask anymore. noticed relaxed less worried first shot even though I‚Äôm fully aware won‚Äôt partially effective two weeks later won‚Äôt fully protected two weeks second shot. 

There‚Äôs psychological feeling rewarded wearing mask get first shot CDC may want encourage moment. That‚Äôs problem argument someone nextdoor neighbor day (that site full idiots) said covid vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect covid doesn‚Äôt cdc say it‚Äôs okay change behavior.

So linked cdc guidance saying vaccinated people gather indoors without masks (along everything else) response ‚Äúwho cares!? already that!‚Äù

So deflect original point she‚Äôs wrong, confirmed many us already know.  mean yes, information would helpful, suggesting Government know letting refusing share? seems scientists still unclear stage summer. agree. They‚Äôre tough spot, coworker totally vaccinated still thinks thing go outside around people. 

I told get drinks outside, balked saying it‚Äôs still safe. 

The messaging needs improve. Vaccinated people scared social interactions kind vaccinated people - clearly are. ""leadership"" Hear out. I'm getting second shot today. I'm wearing fuckin mask anymore. It‚Äôs simple methinks:

I‚Äôd rather 100% people protection instead people (not even) 100% protection. don‚Äôt care. üòÇ Yes compared Cali, far larger state hell lot restrictions winter far better vaccine rollout, it‚Äôs pretty terribly. see end summer. believe could get end year end summer.

Since kids can‚Äôt get vaxxed yet, would avoid like little germ magnets (obv option people kids.) Probably one lowest vaccination rates would assume. Hard well 8% population received dose. comparison US 42% UK pretty much 50%. (Opinion) Nah. abysmally small risk getting covid vaccinated person worth taking sake feeling like singled half-face weirdo party There's doubt vaccines boost immunity, pretend severe risk short period time false line research covid previous coronaviruses.

It's okay tell people get vaccines without pretending severe risk overwise.

I one getting jab hopefully couple months, young people allowed Raises hand That's literally proved works FDA trials Definitely keep producing countries drive done see need immediately.

If 61m doses adults vaccinated estimate it'll take till end July means that's entire supply end July.

So use fully vaccinate adults, get economy restarted help nations manufacturing capacity.

However share vaccines worldwide 1/50,000th population could vaccinated them, drop ocean worldwide (India already administered twice number 1/20 way done) would set us back months. Man people really suck one ever faked ID said every college student ever.

Most fake IDs actual IDs another person. I'm sure agree. green pass program would far away best option everyone. 

It enables folks choose vaccinated dramatically reduce impact create others. essentially internalizes externality (not getting vaccinated). 

It enables choose vaccinated almost immediate return normalcy. restaurant event filled fully vaccinated (or recently recovered) individuals safe restaurant / event. 

It ultimately incents without green passes get vaccinated enable faster return normalcy, helps achieve herd immunity, helps ultimately eliminate need program begin with. 

Everyone wins. That's local grange fair got canceled. insurance usually 15k, COVID pushed 150k. mean? bucks play Pfizer Forum reason doubt?

Just...so dumb really  overstating risks, said correct line scientists governments currently urging people get vaccines whether COVID not. Looks like load shit consistent vaccines like influenza. Even vaccine matches strain circulation year, uncommon vaccinated people get brief infection, odds transmitting much lower. vaccinated people don‚Äôt get sick, either.

Vitamin deficiency also concern winter months, getting chance walk around outside without sunscreen helps us get vitamin D. I'm negating thoughts covid outcomes, pointing sunscreen use places prevalent. Tested***  5-30% chance unvaccinated person getting virus. 

The effective rates vaccines typically shown compared unvaccinated people, (was) ethical study.

You can't study chance someone get Covid exposed virus, unethical expose people virus. (Outside small case studies contact tracing events.) I'm sorry friends wrinkly. Please take personally.  Don‚Äôt really expect case. Barbers shops already open there‚Äôs minimal impact case numbers. next step indoor dining pubs, shouldn‚Äôt much increase.

Yes, are. personally back normal literal minute 2 weeks past 2nd dose, many many people still isolating. part things like restaurants still struggling; open anything want cant force people consumers dont feel safe. example, parents fully vaccinated dearly missed annual disneyland trip last christmas, negative interest going anytime soon. idea tipping point.

I dont know take make people realize getting pfizer/moderna shot means youre safe pre-corona it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll likely struggle months least. There‚Äôs logic. permanently terrified media coverage CDC‚Äôs shitty messaging. still avoiding life even though vaccinated. said really interesting, something thought lot.

I work church. strictly followed CDC guidelines, often exceeding them. One approaches we've unfortunately take intentionally exceed CDC guidelines times pushing boundaries resisting restrictions place within CDC guidelines.

I'm pretty convinced national level, us following guidelines probably following stricter guidelines guidelines written way account resist them. everyone followed recommendations, guess recommendations would relaxed even nothing pandemic changed, simply written resist mind. No. Vaccinated people still chance getting spreading covid. negligible population vaccinated yet. google it. number people MI fully vaccinated got covid spread it. It‚Äôs rare enough it‚Äôs non issue herd immunity half population vaccinated kids vaccinated, it‚Äôs still concern.

It did. Spanish flu absolutely flew population 1918 killed far COVID has, much shorter time period.

In comparison roughly 3-4 million deaths caused COVID far, Spanish Flu killed 20-100 million, time entire world population around 1.8 billion.

Interestingly, India similar issue back currently now. relatively alright first wave summer 1918, second wave hit *hard*, killed around 20 million people. so? I'm suggesting right/safe without worrying bunch crazies think. Lead example. much stayed 2,000 3,000.

Also, regardless, article posted age demographic 18. fact deaths, higher IFR, people age demographic influenza COVID.

I looped 40 demo, lower IFR Covid influenza, leave debate whether higher contagiousness Covid factors deaths total demographic. statistics all, 40 demo INCLUDES 18 demo. Also, also probably factor we've never reported put microscope respiratory virus like COVID.

Children prioritized healthcare. know many would die lockdown, know lot children die lockdown extremely unethical so. 70 million would start December end May June, afaik. Well covid last November Pfizer shots. wonder long I'm good for? brother law told heard canada making plant-based vaccine (talking Medicago) he's going wait vaccine...Putting aside validity waiting 'plant-based' timeline FDA approving emergency use, odds Canada would even export US? Would go Canada get it? remained adamantly opposed getting shot lone holdout mine wife's families. Literally everyone crying thread still wear mask vaccinated. CURRENT guidelines given CURRENT situation population vaccination/infection rates. get vaccine neighbors get vaccines vaccines go infections go down, masks. It‚Äôs easy, aren‚Äôt yet. *Do evidence support PCRs returning 1% false positives?*

No, stay Holiday Inn Express last night. mentality French - single French pharma company came vaccine treatment Covid - first country file charges vaccine company. also lose sympathy daily. turns really vaccine dependent, study Israel mostly Pfizer, seems like effective preventing infection well. makes sense physiology standpoint antibodies spoke protein prevent invasion cell, invasion= infection Well, figured new stuff unrelated fields every time invested heavily basic science, yeah. mother law tested positive antibodies gave blood last time super careful whole time. talking nasal swab? also going vary region.

The SF Bay Area ALREADY around 70% (age 16+) vaccinated, example. imagine they'll still order booster Oxford jabs.

They're diversifying vaccines they'll available them, best thing do. never wear mask plane bus uber, that's sure. extra crowded places like theater costco. i've carrying sanitizer everywhere years cotton mask going big burden. we're assuming new variants years come second dose Monday. Tuesday felt awful. Woke today (Wednesday) feeling totally like again. Hang there!! 49% less likely already caught it. also add efficacy 80-90% prevention infection even detected test. transmission hypothetical group three people (where person unvaccinated infected, person B fully vaccinated, person C unvaccinated uninfected) becomes slim assuming B contact contact C, since B significantly less likely catch virus significantly less likely transmit catch it. situation get better people vaccine agree certain things like masks make sense, even things rapidly improving. feel like idea big reason they're telling vaccinated individuals continue wearing masks. suddenly said wear mask vaccinated, get whole bunch people saying they're vaccinated personal freedoms request proof. 

Not mention people got vaccinated likely people mind wearing mask another while. thought jury still whole catching transmitting asymptomatically vaccinated. I.E. could get symptoms effected it, could still pass people. issue Brazil, though. people vaccinated, it‚Äôs really hard concept‚Ä¶. Xi-Jing-Whinnie-the-Poh Bolsanaro's position there's doubt mind development similar. China Vietnam hit early situation completely different.

A common thing authoritarians can't loose face. Bolsonaro starts position virus established Brazil, obviously rethoric going virus dangerous threat Brazil nation people. things going tits can't admit wrong televise weakness among authoritarians.

China Vietnam never position take original position virus already problem could take swift action perceived 'enemy state'.

You see thing Brazil among nations authoritarian leadership, like India, US Trump, Philippines, several countries Africa. authoritarian countries got hit early, like China, Vietnam, Iran etc, stick position. Keep mind kids sixteen aren‚Äôt cleared vaccine yet they‚Äôre still risk get (especially variant). parents relatives get pass them, that‚Äôs still really terrible experience kids 100% deserve imagine become social thing avoid anyone know isn‚Äôt vax‚Äôd. Masks not, know thanks SM. Madison. One best educated counties nation. Man, state Minnesota alone (population 5.5 million) many daily cases throughout April. got number England, lot better us. wish per capita rate. What's keep hearing patent waiver vaccines? Could really major make be? Every time feel getting mad try ground this. know many trauma fear something profound lives struggling move beyond it.

I think also suffer, especially younger generation, pathological cynicism. revel memes jokes collapse society planet. Gallows humor extreme. We're conditioned always assume worst, try 1up others Doom Takes idea something legitimately positive met resistance. ""catch"", can't go in, get free shot, live normal life. quick easy some. said forever implied wait everyone vaccinated, absolutely never happen. Might've taken bit literally. say aim percentage vaccinated, eventually becomes clear realistically gonna hit number, need better contingency plan sitting around waiting people stop stupid time know, understand imposed lockdown. Exceptionalism, arrogance. wow! agenda UK contributing Covax? Utter rubbish, helped raise money countries contributed millions. obviously can't get credit unless physically made country though.... Totally agree this. People afraid maskless outdoors‚Äînot standing crowd event anything, walking street‚Äîeven though CDC says it‚Äôs safe. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully vaccinated continue double mask outside, even go walk alone. many anti-vaxxers there.‚Äù Huh? It‚Äôs always safe go walk unmasked outdoors. you‚Äôre vaccinated, CDC says it‚Äôs okay, still don‚Äôt believe it. Yikes!

People apply over-cautiousness behavior open like Israel (and beyond point) don‚Äôt understand a) relative risk b) effective vaccines really are. ‚ÄúThe vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection, reduce chances getting seriously ill.‚Äù &lt;‚Äî people still believe that. ‚Äú90% efficacy means still 1 10 chance infected.‚Äù &lt;‚ÄîPeople still think that‚Äôs correct interpretation efficacy rates. unvaccinated people would pretend vaccinated CDC guidelines changed ""Vaccinated people throw away masks need them"".

CDC business social engineering. issue guidelines according science demonstrated cause effect. vaccinated person's wearing mask benefit (all else equal), fact say ""Vaccinated people throw away masks need them"". Anything less erodes public trust (myself included) them, already happened large extent due kinds missteps. ever get place completely ditch masks outdoor concert? Like, truly like before? live global hotspot Brazil's P.1 variant outside Brazil, seen indication data illness mortality younger cohorts risen correspond variant. 

I think likeliest situation Brazil India experiencing uncontained spread populations trend younger. still explain herd immunity point never learn.  Data behind opinions? every adult eligible make appointment? vaccine doesn‚Äôt grant immediate immunity - that‚Äôs you‚Äôre still supposed go two weeks afterwards lumped data together, trying reduce confusion. Sure age cold kill you. afraid mortality?

My grandpa died fall - covid - luckily living independently (with part time caregiver) sad last months life, hated really getting live family. died anyway Randomness, ie lack control, inability ro accept that, drives many issues shitty virus. Good News! 

There likely large overlap population healthcare reform population casual likely get COVID. years start see long term impacts COVID population struggling financial burden healthcare... small chance continue exhibit level selfishness support reform benefit.

OR... continue thing spite themself. Get covid spread dear students. thing teacher Protest/and get fired. clearly dont like teachers students admins. They've proven actions. Source: work schools Last member family gets first shot today really take load mind finally. Yes. significant new information post already discussed. Take look [Rule Pretty much. US several established routes this.

The whole world mechanism using IP, compulsory licencing. country choose now. IP causing supply issues far aware. 

The arguments COVID vaccine IP waivers simple may read press. plenty organisations make vaccine production profitable possible post-pandemic. One part attempting ensure low royalties paid future. likely zero organisations world wide could scale mRNA vaccines without raw material supply constraints currently facing (even tech). viral vector vaccines simpler repeat ""there nothing stopping country using compulsory licencing now"". i'd like see data supporting claims It‚Äôs smart idea county, imagine waking hangover vaccine side effects üò¨  Anecdotal, know folks Covid showing antibodies antibody test.

They ended getting vaccine it, likely know increased risk not. Go Badgers! type thinking wish would have. predictions criticized time supported data. data-based arguments made verge calamity. Scientists producing models January, CDC published, predicted spring plateau sharp drop winter. exactly happened. Osterholm like outliers. majority opinion among scientists, based data, going see actually saw. I've heard cases first jab take second did. quote   repost? posted elsewhere here. yes CDC concerned public health individual health. literally job. nobody's going stop eating spent fission rod can't bad right seem implying government knew restrictions would kill 200k children, time know many lives would save.  sore arm, mild fever several hours brought symptoms like fatigue dizziness, next morning fine. weird something I'm sure vaccine not, several days muscle twitching around elbow arm received shot in. Multiple episodes twitching muscle lasted week. Never muscle spasm like second shot. mostly cleared now, weeks later, occasionally tries spasm again. texas lifted mandates month ago seen increases cases No, low expectations people cool gathering friends clearly risky told experts. doubt careful people followed rules. know people like this. reason shitty time pandemic lost many people (like aunt).  bigger point this- vaccinated, are, intents purposes, done COVID. Therefore, restrictions place. tiny amount outlier/edge cases dictate policy wide basis. TL;DR Wear fucking mask. Many places outdoor mask mandates while. think goal ""wear mask everywhere"" policies normalize mask wearing (regardless setting) make people think moving spaces truly needed. get 2 things without mask yay! That's really good point Mostly extremely low risk, article many gen Z choosing get it, partly blame this

It‚Äôs helping questions even bother extremely low risk anyway, quite frankly nothing changes you

Don‚Äôt get wrong, get vaccine able to, fact allowed continue living life normal frustrating differentiating would lead people disregarding entirely, goes common sense ‚ÄúProbably‚Äú isn‚Äôt good enough me. Current research indicates immunity Covid survivor good someone received vaccines. yet evidence getting vaccinated would give additional protection. possible getting vaccinated could reduce protection. i‚Äôm willing take risk. 2 week break cases going opened up

But that's true. sustained, national rise cases. Anything may look like rise either extremely temporary (usually day two) localised. UK wide stats whole still trending downwards, albeit slower rate schools opened. COVID-19 vaccination likely provide durable immmunity makes MUCH less likely 1) infected first time ever 2) re-infected. literally 100% much less likely. 

in addition, vaccines offer excellent protection sick hospitalized covid. Yes. Depends COVID numbers herd immunity. 

A huge thing keep mind large part population became eligible shots, still yet get shot 2. still million people day getting shot one. unvaccinated people working nursing homes point? among first get vaccinated? benefit getting drivers license, benefit getting vaccine. 

There's difference ""not able go life exactly would global pandemic"" ""no benefit."" less likely get spread deadly disease benefit, one, also even stuff complaining *is* benefit. vaccine, meet indoors vaccinated people without mask. Without, can't safely. benefit?

And benefit, reason people get it. free speech works. required give people platform speech. would actually expression free speech Spotify take content. Find another job. ton remote jobs right now. like concerts hippie stuff. Ive delving paranormal alternative stuff past 5 years body experiences, visions, premonitions, energetical exorcismos, etc. Im totally pro vaccine, Im idiot; science science. yeah, Im minority minority. colleagues acquaintances field much anti vaxxers :( Majority people wearing masks outdoors month now. Mass gatherings happening well. one thing put paper, days paper becoming like $ bill. Next worthless.

Hopefully ready tail end thing, relax, IMHO little premature. vaccine

Yeah probably ADA said, demanding health information like vaccination status think treading *interesting* legal grounds lawyers doubt make killing on... basically says interviews smart people he‚Äôs idiot. you‚Äôre taking recommendations point it‚Äôs you. topics qualified speak on:

Bowhunting.  
BJJ.  
MMA   

...and thats it. It‚Äôs roughly chance spreading flu vaccination.  I've eat times sporadically since indoor dining became thing WV I'm extremely wary would go somewhere crowded ability well six feet folks.

That's touch bars/gyms/theaters/etc., avoid like plague -- pun sorta intended.

Now I'm vaccinated fully Sunday, I'm lot concerned activities. point, anyone need/wants get vaccinated state ease able month now. choose get vaccinated go stupidity point ü§∑ understand every country needs see worst covid gets better time uphold pride Fuck masks! Mate, look post history... I‚Äôm vaccinated somebody else responsibility pretend protect them? shot free easy get. don‚Äôt want wear mask get freaking shot. Yes also fine if, one, person household vaccinated. break further, today:

* 17.4% 18-29 year olds fully vaccinated
* 25.0% first dose 14+ days ago I'd consider ""significant protection"" result vaccine
* 8.3% first dose within last 14 days still building protection vaccine untenable even remote areas Northern Canada Alaska. Also developed countries put eggs Pfizer basket. done amazing job year mean every time. Ah yea bad, Moderna one -20 They're business making health recommendations public. they've always done. mean follow recommendations letter. government form public policy based multiple inputs (health, economy, etc.) Yeah, small thing. know loads people listen stuff, they're going come away thinking vaccines pussies now. One piece missing data time vaccine rollout would go. 

And countries without that, like Canada parts Europe, new waves. heck happened Rogan? used listen ever since switched Spotify moved Texas he's become complete wacko. Virgin AstraZeneca vs Chad Pfizer There‚Äôs difference anti mask pro common sense. There‚Äôs never reason take walk outside family masked long social distancing. government last 12 months incentivized scared whole lot people staying indoors germs spread far worse. vaccinated people still catch virus even get sick. few, some. know. guess clearer person indeed sick. Idk everyone acting like never happens. know several others town gotten sick atleast twice. often, second time worse. One person died 6 months first infection milder. Summer 2020 anymore, known reinfections months now. Like, think South Asia suddenly experiencing surge now? People never properly social distanced, mainly young average age protecting initial mild variants. I'm sharing supply vulnerable population still need second doses. context, 88 86 year old parents second doses couple weeks ago. look ahead partly we're delaying second doses.

The problem EU invoking part contract UK also EU factories contract helped fund them. EU blocking AZ exports, fair enough. can't demand supplies also much right EU made doses argument made. We've seeing happen countries great vaccine rollouts. 

We might another wave shots getting arms.  really oversight like can't give 500 example plus exceptions rule work people read legal doc cuz can't read   UFC packed arena past weekend Florida full 17,000 (quite lot maskless) fans. Nah here's [NYT ""When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,"" Fauci said. ""Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, 'I nudge bit,' went 80, 85.""

It response anything scientific, moreso ""the public's willingness take increased, I'm increasing thresholds proportionally."" gonna lie, approach really inspire lot confidence me. wish could base definitions science rather arbitrary ""nudge-ups."" you‚Äôre vaccinated it‚Äôs protect themselves. You‚Äôve already done part. NY im noticing slowly people slowly relaxed masks. honestly can't wait Yes, point use common sense Orange County, Florida. California. idiot. chart two groups interact would useful type chart, reasonable guess they're depicted one chart.

Instead, reason appears trying contrast guidelines emphasize vaccination buys you. And/or want distribute two charts people look wrong one without noticing. agree children vaccinated, kid get idgaf anymore people wanna do. UK lost 100,000 people strategy. Nothing could called *very well* includes halfway competent late game really dropping ball beforehand. Nah 1 feet away you‚Äôre entire upper body encompassing volume cough trajectory breathing area.

6 feet away safer gas expands disperses hundreds times more, you‚Äôre still taking significant portion cough droplets coughed on, much regards breath.

Keep mind may dissipate later, there‚Äôs still seconds cough particles highly concentrated land high amounts. effectiveness mRNA vaccines trials 95% preventing illness. 5% hundreds millions people still millions people. would think anyone presenting opinions informed valid would aware simple things like that.  probably good idea mask indoors high intensity excercise. agree last one Even vaccine expect end pandemic people reinfected like common cold flu? source that? find hard believe people Georgia living 2 hours nearest pharmacy. live far pharmacy, bigger problems besides able get vaccinated. American looking in, seems though AZ hoarding vaccines UK. UK EU short vaccines. can't expect magically poof vaccines existence, unfortunately. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, hey, it‚Äôs common sense. wear mask around people haven‚Äôt gotten vaccination? wear it. flu shots start decline protection 6 months. asked wear mask 6 months flu shot next one? trying make pandemic last forever? Currently getting slammed subreddit saying bad idea become ""fully vaxxed"" two days (2 weeks second dose), wife got first. I'll still pretty careful fully vaxxed. blame Joe Biden Novovax stored regular fridge temperatures Sounds stupid fuck lol. I‚Äôll stay forest. Sounds like trying play epidemiologist year anecdotal experience. think we're it, gotta taken face value. thing say dual group 20 vaccinated/unvaccinated people, efficacy rate found 95%. Anything baseless conjecture.

It's making sad society ends completely disregarding scientific method fit narratives... Here‚Äôs glimpse type people you‚Äôre dealing people afraid others think matter ridiculous, willing things make absolutely sense come equally dumb reasons justify they‚Äôre doing.

This fascinating watch group think action weak people work brains go grain. seems it‚Äôs people believe educated backbone. 

It also shows much view masks tool effort stop spread COVID sort political ID card flag. it‚Äôs going hard give up, never will. fully expect CDC longer recommend masks activity point future. current guidelines/recommendations. Trevor Noah like one seen cases second infections worse people

Yes, know someone who's young much tougher second infection, far know that's rare One funeral home worked also pet retort. families pet removal calls always much emotional follow science lmao wore double mask last year since April cuz buy mask earlier got sold out. vaccinations happened started single masking.
By way, probably good idea mask indoors high intensity excercise. agree last one conducting trials didn‚Äôt take account fact lockdowns distancing still happening? data 
 skewed/did get developed circumstances perfect? think enough stories ""no new cases tri-county area"" sort. AMC theater opening first time since early 2020. joy saw lights go up. miss :D agree supply awful, seems harsh demand supply another country also short-falls. mean fortunate position UK would agree sharing supply vulnerable mostly vaccinated, presumably needed second doses here. parents got second dose couple weeks ago they're 80s, must good chunk vulnerable people still needing second dose. one saying 2 weeks either feel like must middle ground here. Seems like anything all. old vulnerable already vaccinated? think argument way overstated.

More point, expect least half US going take vaccine, leaving *at most* 180M unvaccinated people. going infinitesimal fraction people worldwide get/have gotten COVID. estimates 500M people India gotten COVID. variant threat global one, unvaccinated Americans small drop huge bucket.

Second, reach herd immunity one way another. half country vaccinated (and probably substantially higher this), let everyone else get infected naturally. immunity also counts towards herd immunity. incredibly stupid people, works. children aren‚Äôt risk running hospitals think now, matter timing. CDC guidelines eventually updated recommend masks activity certain percentage population vaccinated. think like people shots cuz care Russian attitude towards vaccine development rubs wrong way. 

In science enough get right results, need follow ethical method. COVID wasn't/isn't deadly enough pull crap skipping phase 3 testing. Maybe COVID-19 mortality rate Ebola (20%&lt;) could justified still. 

Congratulations making successful vaccine, cannot point results say ""The vaccine works clearly testing approach does"". 

And boldly claiming vaccines safe, also vaccines mRNA ones 32x deadlier. 

I know cultural, Russia/China long approach science; ends always justify means. goes lots southern states. West Virginia comes mind. Among worst states health care, education, economy, infrastructure, blown away natural beauty potential adventure sports. back envelope comparison Spanish Flu months ago. Covid hitting 1918 med tech basically kills 1/4 rate flu did, actually 2/3 infectious (this would OG Covid, new variants). roughly jibes NYC health department said summer, city (overwhelmed hospitals treatments, though oxygen crisis) saw death rate around 70% saw Spanish Flu. remember one guy NewsRadio look That‚Äôs super interesting! I‚Äôll try read work today, described it, seems like really hopeful study. 

Though time, taking study absolute truth, also see they‚Äôd want err side caution little while. Masks easy, governing force changing stance ramifications affect people wearing masks would, taking slow safest move. Moderna Pfizer shown around 80% effective 2 weeks first dose. 

That's study done young, female health care workers, relatively small sample size. 

Much larger studies done UK Israel (over million people!) shows lot lower that. 

Same published study, published *New England Journal found vaccine efficacy first second doses 52% That's true testing people symptoms people exposed obviously hear anyone complain time tail end side effects. Soreness everywhere hard time moving around mild fever. Possibly fault worked immediately going get shot Monday. 100 percent worth it. Joe Rogan like living counter argument unlimited free speech. conspiracy theories peddled program one thing, humors beyond needed carry conversation. comment section still open!!! could go one dose, doses identical.  ""If you‚Äôre healthy person you‚Äôre exercising time you‚Äôre young you‚Äôre eating well, don‚Äôt think need worry \[getting vaccinated\].""

hes specifically saying get vaccinated though. hes never claimed doctor, always says dont take advice him... stating opinions podcast isnt news outlet. different opinions hes saying try cancel expressing opinion. hes pro making choices Ok nutjob Wait two weeks second dose vaccine.

Then ""fully vaccinated"". really feel like outrage(on r politics, Twitter, even people here) CDC mask restrictions loosened greatly exemplifies difference social media real life, go gym 6 days week, masks required, going months counted 5 people wearing masks entire time, people enter on, immediately take off, honestly ever seen 10 people outside ever wear mask live. see anyone know anything happy least somewhat seeing return slightly normal behaviors. Hey Alex Jones Tim Dillon episode sucked final straw. Cornell educated medical doctor versus someone dropped UMass. 

Yeah, know I‚Äôm getting healthcare information. Eat dick, Joe. may true, doesnt change fact governments represent people supposed right thing people first. pharmacy mean touch world. People still go stores, school, work. Nobody problem individuals want stay masked up, social distance, etc. problem comes never metrics given mandates orders go away. ‚ÄúJust little longer‚Äù exactly im talking about. point definitely doesn‚Äôt stand lol  thats cause natural antibodies less effective vs vaccine ones Yea.... makes want opposite spite. See bitches gloryhole Laughed little hard one üòÜ well stated. like it. Anyone data delayed side effects first dose? 14 days since first pfizer shot low grade fever, chills, migraine last night. can't find anything online. go get tested today quarantined get results. everything read, somewhere around 80% protected point. wife braced side effects Pfizer shots worst happened sore arm (difficult raise it) two days. felt mild soreness right injection site, fine hours. one man power. novel coronavirus mutates easily. means vaccine might less effective future years. 

You might need get booster shot, like *every year* flu. watched video. good. excellent completely ignores fact Golgi apparatus shuttle spikes outside cell.

""The spike protein either broken smaller pieces (peptides) proteasome transported via Golgi apparatus outside cell.""

""The spike proteins outside cell taken different immune cells broken pieces endosome. pieces presented cell surface complex MHC class II protein, recognized CD4+ cells facilitating B cells make antigen-specific Nope, get vaccinated ignore people say ""YoU sTiLl NeEd WeAr mAsK!"". data supporting vaccinated individuals passing virus around. Reminds comment friend made reading care instructions new article clothing. ""You remember things written lowest common denominator society."" guess full picture, since I'm urban NJ/NYC area. town mandates wearing masks even outdoors, recent guideline changes improvement me. long essential workers, households multiple members, asymptomatic infections, virus completely knocked lockdown spreading freely past certain point. many people take run city make sure citizens die? Healthcare workers, police, firemen, food producers, transporters, sellers, people keep necessities running like water, electricity, garbage, internet. I've seen estimates 17% people US essential work. Testing contact tracing matters lot 17% people can't isolate. we're annoyed CDC overly conservative comes advisories, especially vaccinated. Last heard EXTREMELY low chance catching even do, EXTREMELY low chance spreading it. sure would live lives around really low chance happening plenty dangers world worrying about. tells virtually impossible people fully vaccinated catch transmit virus

This factually incorrect. variance vaccines' effectiveness variance versus different variants, say nothing likelihood need future boosters Covid changes. Moderna Pfizer great success right variants tested with. even though currently appear strong existing variants, [they slightly less potent variants absolute true **very unlikely** fully vaccinated people get **badly ill**. we're talking difference between, ""Stay home sick bit,"" and, ""Go hospital ER,"" *virtually impossible* vaccinated get sick.  going lie, getting back gym past month getting gains back... find working wearing mask freaking hard. Especially heavier compound lifts like deadlifts... I'm working really hard almost suffocating. still push huge relief go outside gym breathe fresh air. can't even imagine feels running 800 meter race mask on. thought bad thing read comments lol Contact tracing shows us private indoor gatherings worst source spread follow FAR behind restaurants. literally made ""fact"" up. dislike something, mean super spreader. think that's true. think 95% really means 95% fewer people vaccinated population caught covid compared control group. 5% vaccinated group actually caught covid would probably suggest vaccine ineffective, especially infection rate 5% less general population. Watch conspiracy theorost spin something crazy. Also, guy says, people would try get seem smart. Pretty sure experts quite certain get immunity infection really tool use probably nothing want overstate.  standard perpetuates disparities around world, have-nots remain have-nots. month much hatred one nation, like we're kind seperate sub species...instead of, perhaps, made individual humans country. LMAO someone living somewhere drive 2 hours get shot even cough medicine matter, they're probably grid even know we're middle pandemic non issue. Lmao even sounds awful short Spotify ads get podcast he‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs powerful, man...something powerful‚Äù sounds like absolutely idea he‚Äôs talking even ads sponsoring content lol I'll never understand mask mandates vaccinated somehow preferable vaccine passports. Well yeah, US we've vaccinated much population. Also, I'd like add 2 links person posted originally responded disingenuous presented.

No. 1 - posted flu deaths corresponding age demographics year 2018-2019, ~34,000 reported Flu-related deaths. choose 2018-2019, relatively mild year Flu. year before, ~61,000 deaths reported Flu. Cherry-picking data disingenuous nothing argument.

No.2 - link posted COVID deaths annual, directly comparable Flu link anyways. total entire time we've reporting COVID deaths, includes 2 spring-time winter, whereas annual reporting would break winter reporting half. So, again, comparable. people aren‚Äôt pussies putting piece cloth face So, dick nosing gym since September, visiting maskless underground dance club shut down? Nothing news, people wearing outdoors anyway. ain't gift. Guess gonna wear masks, shut businesses, social distance forever then. Probably Lmao Joe rogan, who's main competency supposed mma even good that.

His commentary sucks biased hell. israel vs jan fight interviewed Jan asked like move weight classes never 

If he's fucking clueless one thing he's actually knowledgeable about...imagine body knowledge wanted provide experience here... husband got second doses Moderna Saturday happy report minimal side effects. Sore arm (not shocking, get sore arm every shot...flu, tDap, etc), tiredness, slight headache. TBH, I'm even sure attribute vaccine, I'm tired mom rambunctious 1 year old, lol. 

My husband, however, felt totally fine Saturday Sunday, woke Monday morning extremely nauseous dizzy. Vomited times. actually call work sleep in. Again, sure vaccine related result bad food one many drinks Sunday night. But, felt much better Monday afternoon. 

For context, early 30s, health issues. Prior getting vaccine, made sure stay fully hydrated week leading shot, ate something getting shot. Tylenol hand take afterwards case, need it. 

So excited there's light end tunnel - let's go! don't. think people least little bit anxious needles. people need blood draws shots time, something endure seconds. many great skills coping distracting yourself.

And situation, people giving shots honestly probably give hundreds every day. They're pros. He‚Äôs honestly worse yet probably even denies comparison. agreed, point believe progress going stall theyre much convince people fence getting (for reasons ive mentioned). people need clear cut reasons get vaccine dont whole heartedly believe in, dont take covid seriously dont feel theyre severely risk group. get sides, people want freedoms back soon theyre vaccinated, govt play safe long possible well dealing people lie vaccinated enjoy freedoms kind idiot recommends people get vaccinated outside specific circumstances? even thing fucking crazy. baby oil, condoms best Barry White. vaccine give lifelong protection. Go ahead put mask immunity goes back  Bro brogan fucking idiot. word someone experiencing side effects 7 days 1st dose? got low grade fever chills 14 days 1st dose. I'm scheduled get 2nd shot next week. can't find much online delayed side effects. got Pfizer shot btw  actual numbers share here? Genuinely interested realistic data point could justify ‚Äúmillions people‚Äù vaccinated still catch Covid mentioned above? [Like this? March 2020: 2 week lockdowns hospitals dont get overcrowded!

April 2021: worse 6 months ago! (Spoiler alert, not) lift restrictions over! (Fails give metrics would indicate ‚Äúover‚Äù) Apparently can, capacity spread virus get infected greatly reduced - least 50% apparently. people fail realize spread virus stochastic phenomenon relies certain statistical parameters . need vaccines provide 'perfect steriliizing immunity' people \_never\_ get sick \_never\_ transmit it. need R k parameters become low enough. pandemic dies out. Think way: count everyone know either COVID, everyone got vaccinations, everyone got both. many people counted? Like 25? 50? 100? many got COVID second time vaccination? I'd bet one guy.

Now back study: 95% people maintain immunity reinfection, roughly 95% people vaccinated maintain immunity. means 1 20 (5%). I'd guess experience friends/family/contacts support statistics. 1 person got it, bunch others didn't. sounds lot like 95% immunity.  still get people listen D- comic. gets super high rambles randos. like late teens again. Obviously anecdotal mom 69 fever chills headache moderna 2, mil 75 got go dr racing heart side effect Pfizer 2.
Fil 76 nothing moderna 2.
My aunt 72 nothing moderna 2.  think main reason add there's equivalent situation unvaccinated people. whole point infographic showing like situations comparing risk two individuals, one vaccinated one unvaccinated, unvaccinated person cannot situation everyone vaccinated would create logical fallacy statement. definitely think disclaimer section bottom understand infographic part trying give direct comparisons one exist. probably going pretty difficult get reliable data India right now, absolutely interesting knowledge. would go indoors. don‚Äôt want become one people got close caught end. realistic chance games happening point? Cases accelerating fourth wave. 1% Japanese people fully vaccinated. can't see happening. Mixed ‚Ä¶ gin vermouth splash mRNA goddamn amazing, legit science fiction. Imagine showing someone 100 years ago.  wonderful laws TN mentioned. really wish Bible one passed. I‚Äôm happy see TN get rid restrictions mandates COVID. love Joe podcast he's lost damn mind regarding COVID. valid points first like encouraging people healthy take vitamin legitimate criticisms CA lockdowns, quickly turned rants freedom seemingly anti-vax attitude. little bit surprising considering he's pretty experimental medical procedures like stem cell injections fascination steroids things like that. think happier can.  might lead creedence hands ""florida approach""

Because ‚ÄúFlorida approach‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist. governor doesn‚Äôt enact restrictions major urban areas (which exactly happened Florida), majority residents experience governor mandated restrictions. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs bad thing seem guests less varied past, wonder it‚Äôs it‚Äôs tougher get interesting people go podcast Cali I'm someone medication suppresses immune system fully vaccinated, good chance vaccine effective would someone normal immune system. sadly continuing wear mask increase protection purpose mask prevent spreading others. feel nearing point masks generally go away risk level people like becomes normal. Lmao It‚Äôs selection bias. still relatively uncommon area cases sent hospital. 

It‚Äôs like breaking leg pretty uncommon someone works orthopedics says still see tons broken legs

It‚Äôs highly informative unles simply trying disprove idea broken bones don‚Äôt happen studied showed Pfizer vaccine remains effective long period? aren't, paid $100 million exclusivity Spotify, #1 podcaster far, even close, 200 million listens per month. True, that's would expect many people. 

However, seen cases second infections worse people, study would expect healthy 18-20 year olds mild cases anyway.  would whole lot persuasive people right mask (in terms encouraging people get vaccinated)  Disgusting. deplatformed. trial on-going far know results published yet. Okay! Thank much! Yep. I'm day 2. dizzy fatigued better awful chills fever yesterday. Absolutely sickest I've since college.  Right, that's vaccine works programming immune response. people immune deficiencies, vaccinations effective.

But broadly, people, fully vaccinated makes extremely unlikely contract COVID. good. See them.

While there, sign non-vax friends shots too. ;)  Well guess I'll stay home more. distiniction unvaccinated people already infected not? youre testing positive antibodies isn‚Äôt vaccinated? And? realize every thread world south vs everyone else discussion, right? OP simply trying come reasons cases might rising parts PNW. tend let guard early. instance, look bigger (global) picture. India, Japan, Canada, South America, parts Europe even America. I'm saying need lock down, double gathering numbers still fully vaccinated way. Lol Yup. friend mine big Joe Rogan podcast fan like ""I think I'm gong wait see things play next 6 months year, get vaccinated see people get sick (from vaccine)."" like ""Well I'm getting shit ASAP."" One week later went got vaccinated together. lot people can't lot people didn't. Joe Rogan mainstream Alex Jones.  remember, government treats citizens like children, behave like children. CDC President told truth virus spreads mask recommendations start, we‚Äôd beaten already.

If isolated whole year (like aside work) ability outside peace mind visit vaccinated people feels like huge win. end soon enough, people lose whole ""why get vaccinated give ability act like over"" mentality.

Getting vaccine acting like like declaring victory Day. huge turning point still need see end.  Truth told, fully vaccinated, ditch mask. tell people want people lying saying they're vaccinated they're not. we'll probably go back mostly maskless somewhere around 90-95% fully vaccinated nationally. buying time stopping variant. watch countries try keep variants US.

Wearing fabric mask hanging people protects them, still well exposed contagion. vax appear severely mitigate risks bad covid case vaxxed people. 95+% protection disease 0.02% fatality rate... good odds compared normal flu season vax. Forcing vaxxed people wear mask protects others seems bit top Opposite here. vaccines teachers allowed wear masks might scare kids.

Maybe download copy make mistake using recovery rate talking mortality rate. same. health care less busy, people come hospitals milder illness better recovery. mean better mortality. paper mentions multiple times lockdown associated mortality evidence shown. sure what's argue here. Right realize asking pressing concern here, effectively vaccinating adult population much towards preventing deaths vaccinating children. 

The primary function vaccine reducing deaths hospitalisations hospitals ever get overwhelmed like pandemic. want speak parents, knowing parents many others, want vaccinate child something even get sick. vaccines 100% effective preventing cases

NC resident though people wearing masks outside. I‚Äôd say inside store 99% sometimes even 100%.  However, it‚Äôs pretty rare see someone wearing one outside. Going run exposure event unless running slipstream infected runner 15 minutes more.  even idea -- providing multiple perspectives issue letting people come conclusion -- fine simple things little real-world consequence, often reductionist gives people illusion also achieved kind expertise subject able draw sensible conclusion themselves. 

For complex topic, novice likely learn enough hour two listening conversation become expert enough make kind founded conclusion themselves. expert complex topic (Climate change, MRNA Vaccines, Covid19) hardly even enough time adequately introduce complex topic, let alone describe enough detail total non-expert get speed subject understand well enough make informed decision. 

Often reasonable approach complex topic adopt consensus experts (unless willing put time effort go education process become expert yourself). Thinking know enough means likely convinced arguments data convince expert know what's relevant what's not. basically ignore everything poster said. He's full crap.

Several times. I've fully vaccinated almost 3 months finally feel alive again. Maybe I've extreme 180 flip obsessively fearful ""fuck covid"" attitude, I'm done. suffered long enough. science there, likelyhood transmitting low, longer afraid getting sick. Unless I'm place need go requires it, longer wear mask. weird though, thinking back ok wearing 2-3 masks time, day. actively afraid people wearing masks would avoid them. everything annoys longer think it, get pissed off... actually got covid three separate times half year, need examined. literally unprecedented. would imply immunity them. got once, tested positive months long haul symptoms, that's different story. I've busy appliance store year 20 sales people one person Covid. sometimes many customers crazy. I'm UK, rather US, understanding US might *never* get 70% vaccinated due hesitancy. would, course, hit herd immunity eventually even absence vaccine, better metric (which harder know sure) total amount immunity, whether vaccinated surviving previous infection. 

England's roadmap lockdown calls social distancing measures end June 21, bit unclear whether mean masks. hope does, guess we'll wait see. covid still mutate. that's life. ....any produced delivered vaccine good! Problem is, AZ business that, fails actually this, paid upfront nevertheless.  makes sense. miss days Redban 1.0 talks Olive Garden I'm teacher. get fairly ill every winter respiratory infections. first time I've I'll keeping going mask use. maybe one thing would incentive--CDC says fully vaccinated people (14 days final vaccine dose) quarantine exposed COVID. example, 1 worker unvaccinated, came work, rest employees would able keep working fully vaccinated. actually tried good influence came masking up.
(Also platform white supremacists...) That's exactly going post. Thanks buddy get medical advice stand comedians reality TV hosts that's honestly lmao Ummm. everyone else already vaccinated. what, 50% vaccinated point? That's still whole ton unvaccinated people, including kids eligible even get yet.  Go listen Lex Friedman's podcast. podcasts great seems like genuinely good person. mostly quit listening JRE guests good anymore IMO. airbags work. mean also wear seatbelt. masks.

And explain social distanced, tested / vaccinated, attended. (and others comment chain) repeatedly making false statements, rarely happens without political agenda.

Hospitalizations rising cases, actually worrisome. Oregon see many regions state nearing full hospital capacity. Positivity rising along cases risen three-fold Oregon - 12% places Oregon last reporting period. 10% Colorado yesterday.

For bizarre thing inexplicable. many parts country vaccinated fewer people, yet cases dramatically falling. What's different Oregon Colorado? change next week, way Michigan last week? must, right? 

But vaccination rates falling cliff entirely possible actually choose letting unvaccinated population (including everyone 16) catch COVID, continuing/bringing back restrictions. bullshit choice. need let kids get vaccinated pay adults get vaccinated. That‚Äôs right. article: 

- 1379 infections seen fully vaccinated people. Cases seen unvaccinated partially vaccinated people weren‚Äôt counted. 

- breakthrough cases account .1% roughly 1.4 million cases. 145 medium, medium rare (130-135).

You're assuming people act irrationally logically widespread advice masks needed vaccinated. _will_ people abuse system, can't open worms yet. CDC also says cook steak 165 degrees inside (which well done steak) doubt false positive rate anywhere close high best PCR tests.

One way estimate upper bound false positives would use test results country region extremely low prevalence assume positive results false positives.

For example, New Zealand posts testing results [this past 4 weeks (Mar 29-April 25), conducted 115379 tests got 171 positive. assume false positives, that's false positive rate 0.15%. (A 0.09% tests inconclusive.)

If restrict community testing (and exclude related quarantines), related quarantine, 94170 tests performed 28 positive results, positivity rate 0.03%. (0.11% inconclusive.) [This study important caveats here. Number one, false positive rate test depends test. Site collection, method collection, type test, etc. There's way arrive one true false positive rate overall, 1% pretty reasonable estimate considering know PCR testing general. Covid disease PCR test.

Second, likelihood false positive directly related disease prevalence. there's lot disease, less likely positive result false positive. there's lot disease, likely result false positive.

Prevalence disease best estimated positivity rate test well total number tests performed. 

A high number tests low positivity rate generally predictive low prevalence. positive test evaluated clinical signs symptoms rule possibility false positive. also repeat test. chances two false positives patient quite low, especially use two different tests. 

A low number tests high positivity rate indicate whether prevalence high low. testing needed. test 5 100,000 people, 5 positive, know certainty many remaining 99,995 people may positive.

If test high number people there's high positivity rate, prevalence disease high, positive test would reliable predictor infection.

Put another way: tested 40M people California ebola using PCR test, small number tests would come back positive. ebola California (the disease prevalence low), reasonably sure people tested positive ebola, even though test says do.

DELHI ‚Äî Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, huge facility middle India‚Äôs capital, 37 fully vaccinated doctors came Covid-19 earlier infections left mild symptoms, added growing fears virus behind India‚Äôs catastrophic second wave different. wonder contagious variant dodges immune system could fueling epidemic inside world‚Äôs hardest-hit far evidence inconclusive, researchers caution factors could explain viciousness outbreak, overwhelmed India‚Äôs capital quickly hospitals entirely overrun crematories burn nonstop. Still, presence variant could complicate taming India‚Äôs Covid-19 disaster. seriously dont see people get high infection rate predictions. pretty simple take covid deaths excess deaths simple math ifr estimate range give infection totals. around 600,000 deaths(number excess deaths covid deaths) ifr estimate range 0.7% 1.15%. probably around 42 69 million infections. 15% 20% infection rate US. sub accepts ‚Äúscience‚Äù comes sensationalizing things.  past past. used say sorts horrible stuff Xbox live kid, didn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm pretty decent person nowadays. obsession cancelling people things said years ago completely stupid. got first AZ dose yesterday, I'm 48. That's terrible analogy. risk catching Corona outdoors socially distanced infinitesimal. Literally less 1 million. significant additional gain wearing mask situation.

If airbags, add seatbelt, significantly increase likelihood survival decrease likelihood severity injuries.

Or words, airbag confers additional benefits. already outdoors social distancing masks confer additional benefits.

I say someone double vaccinated pro-mask indoors still happy wear one indoors.

I think saying obviously wrong dumb things helping anything here. going convince anti-maskers, going make double down. good idea practice bad logic benefits want true. \^ see. lie us good boys girls. 

""You made it, baby. want lie you."" Yeah I‚Äôm in. Burning man 2022, I‚Äôll see brother/sister. What‚Äôs rule wearing masks outside it‚Äôs crowded? count crowded?   Already partially pre vaccinated Sars Cov 3.

Jokes aside probably another SARS virus waiting jump human host somewhere. chaos, actually zero pooping :( Someone know concerned mRNA vaccines could trigger long term autoimmune problems. looked research papers articles mRNA studies mentioned concern one reasons companies turned mRNA therapies vaccines. understand correctly risk vaccines considered negligible lower dosage 2 shots compared types mRNA therapies. arguments supporting mRNA vaccines trigger autoimmune reactions? Dont think im giving mask atleast another year. part now. know. don‚Äôt trust vaccine. It‚Äôs emergency use. really super vetted imo. 
Plus chances reaction low, don‚Äôt feel like rolling dice. I‚Äôm happy continue social distancing wearing mask though don‚Äôt like people anyway. Dr. Barron: sorry daughter struggling. challenging year many. currently data suggests vaccines worsen existing depression cause depression. side effects primarily physical symptoms including fevers, chills, muscle aches fatigue self-limited. Appreciate it! Dr. Zane: Approximately 30% patients develop self-limited symptoms like mild fevers, myalgias headache second dose. they're easily managed over-the-counter analgesics. likely need boosters, however, unclear timing is. appears Pfizer Moderna developing planning boosters sometime summer fall. Maybe sooner.  Hi, get infected vaccination doses, would still take second dose first take antibody test skip second one?
And would go second dose, long advice wait mild case? 
Thanks! true train cars sitting close another person. new guidelines state still wear outdoors can't avoid crowd. Obviously... point meets standards successful vaccine canned?  like mask guideline Australia Dr, I‚Äôve seen different numbers. studies back up? Sometimes gets sent identification. last four years? large swath population practically allergic facts reason. pandemmy opened eyes always here. say ***not*** vaccinated? CDC overcomplicating things insofar masking up...yes, get **shot**, keep **mask** face, many things **outside** possible. There, better now? including kids eligible even get yet.

Kids risk. J&amp;J jab costs 300% AZ one, makes huge difference poorer nations. 

In number situations past, proven true. J&amp;J costs around $10 per person vaccinate one dose vaccine. SA paid $5.25 per dose AZ, $10.50 per person, whilst Bangladesh paid $5 per dose, full vaccination $10 per recipient. Uganda, shockingly, paid $7 per dose $14 per fully vaccinated recipient.  


Please look pricing discrepancies applied AZ ordinary course business. way statement J&amp;J costs 300% AZ true reality. get vaccinated still get COVID symptoms less severe. question get COVID spread people? first thought logically I'm seeing can't? anyone verify? Dr. Kutner: Pfizer vaccine efficacy first dose approximately 50%. Efficacy increases approximately 94% second dose. true original COVID variants. anti science, anti reason, anti common sense. tf cares man honestly paying attention last 5 years you?  Dr. Barron: Yes, likely going something receive every year similar flu vaccine. clear time combined common vaccines receive. Yeah, people get novelty whole situation disappointed things slowly begin return normal. might nearly impossible get severe COVID symptoms still possible spread virus people vaccinated. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines effective preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection real-world conditions. noticed Nashville one hottest weekend destinations country last years? Hey live Morris County lol. info NYT? better now. weak, also dizzy getting up. celebs telling people get vaccine? Bill Gates? Old people people too. fucking bigot think certain demographic dying matter. fact disease targets feable old make ""better"". innocent people would died covid. 

The dying ""with"" covid argument total bullshit. count deaths diseases way. woulda thought random podcaster knows nothing science meant CDC telling me. business walk still wants mask will. CDC putting message saying ‚ÄúAw yea you‚Äôre vaccinated? Okay put masks hanging anywys‚Äù I‚Äôm listening that. whole point lockdown vaccines beat thing wear masks rest lives. Yeah, really funny joke Help what?? Nobody died corona 2021.why send India? Regardless vaccines, would prefer everyone kept social distancing. Forever. ""If you‚Äôre healthy person you‚Äôre exercising time you‚Äôre young you‚Äôre eating well, don‚Äôt think need worry [getting vaccinated].""

So anyone young suffered severe symptoms long haul Covid, deserve it, taking care themselves. 

He Bill Maher idiots comes science health. Dr. Barron: G'day you! time interval two doses vaccination somewhat based desire data efficacy soon feasible. terms T-cell immunity, important factor many viruses probably critical COVID-19. B-cell responses elicited currently available vaccines appear broad enough neutralizing COVID-19 variants. proper unit analysis determining whether population‚Äôs vaccination rates prevent spread within community? see stats Denver County Colorado, really seal border, must think unitary nations looking vax rates? city region useful statistics herd immunity transmissibility?  Hey, thanks this. I'm trying convince relative get vaccinated. point 1976 flu vaccine they're going ""wait see."" I've read (somewhere) vccine related side effects - even rare ones - manifest quickly detected quickly (as case AZ J&amp;J). help argument - given we're 142 million people in, nearly year data since Phase trial - we'd know serious side effects mRNA vaccines? also know pointed mRNA new, tested degree SARS MERS. help appreciated

PS - fully vaccinated myself, 100% believer vaccines key ending this. read article that‚Äôs really certain anecdotal, well still uncommon. right, there's definitely difference careful people they're vaccinated. CDC guidance circumstances vaccinated people want mask helpful. evidence far vaccinated, possible pretty unlikely transmit Covid-19.

I'm sorry misinterpreted comment. phase 3 trials conducted July 2020 November 2020, know would characterize periods ""locked down"". take point compared right US, lot less restrictions states lifted restrictions may lifting mask mandates soon. expect see rise hospitalizations vaccinated people even engage riskier behavior protection severe cases nearly 100% vaccines authorized US. That's I've telling everyone brings defense CDC lifting mask guidelines fully vaccinated people despite proven risk insanely low. replies really bugging me. Thousands already died, millions across world. really much fucking nuisance continue wearing masks even getting vaccinated? Idc Reddit expert self proclaimed medical expert says here, CDC lot credible anon. shoot laser beams eyes now? Netherlands probably 75-85% adults, probably still busy vaccinations 2 months (expected done first week July, enough doses vaccinate entire adult population mid-July).

[Results nationwide April 12th vaccinated (currently 27th April)

8% appointment (so 24% already process vaccinated)

42% sure get vaccine (66% certain get vaccine total)

15% probably get vaccine (81% likely get vaccine total)

5% sure yet.

5% probably get vaccine

9% sure get vaccine  EU pretty diverse. countries hit wall far sooner others. Amazing. get Sun best selling newspaper. fall winter definitely weird.

At current pace, North America Europe track reach herd immunity (or close) then, rest world still going dealing Covid. Hopefully things improve Washington state soon sick tired hearing counties going back phase! governor strict governors sucks see places restrictions like Florida better. hope madness ends soon!ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Dr. Kutner: reason CDC recommends continued masking settings crowds prevent transmission, given still sufficient number people vaccinated. people get vaccinated, sooner able maskless settings. love clip. gained respect Bill. Rogan, I‚Äôve lost respect back.  say politicians various flavours? Life short pick apart European bureaucracy Source needed claim. called racist saying winter, lol pretty hilarious ask me.   majority yet gotten it, people remaining need hearing bad information  seems every time anything related trans people comes podcast people he‚Äôs interviewing outright lie basic facts regarding trans people transition entails.

Joe Rogan sides people like Shapiro every time nerve couch ‚ÄúI‚Äôm transphobic *buuut*... (insert overtly transphobic claims/stereotypes)‚Äù. It‚Äôs depressing see many viewers actually believe defend it.

For several years find someone listens podcast, I‚Äôll maybe try educate definitely don‚Äôt fuck beyond that. It‚Äôs healthy trans person get close anyone willing buy he‚Äôs selling. vaccine less safe, true, AZ test adequately elderly, also true. mean az honour contracts, though. felt horrible 3 days first dose Moderna I'm terrified get second. Covid December read sometimes Covid, first shot ends making feel bad second shot fine. truth this? think sounds like anxiety symptom (as fellow anxiety sufferer). You‚Äôd probably know something wrong quickly clotting issue. course, you‚Äôre worried, never hurts talk doctor! think you‚Äôre fine. Remember, blood clot issue incredibly rare - perhaps one 500,000. odd CDC Fauci already said approve indoor gatherings masks distancing among fully vaccinatinated people weeks ago. Why? private business wants. 100%? Get shot there's chance may work Monday. mom, wife, got J&amp;J three us mild fever kept us night after. day after, able work remotely, would driving. heard uncommon response vaccine, common response either, may experience this, prepared it.    fuck say vaccines effective preventing severe covid? Well majority gotten logic. Bill Burr violent, angry father sometimes talks podcast comedy shows. don‚Äôt think normally frames abuse audience led conclusion. knows exactly he's spreading misogyny racism

You obviously listen podcast all. Rogan far racist. Big facts, way people take political advice them. real knowledge either whatsoever  There's big difference disagreement nuance political opinion letting someone sit willfully purposefully spread misinformation attempt brainwash viewers. 

Anti-Maskers difference opinion. They're dangerous. taken it?  dick responses? First all. 

Secondly, get tested anyway? need quarantine exposure fully vaccinated asymptomatic. people watch guy? He's terrible host, spews bullshit time acts like expert every subject. Never understood appeal him. I'm pretty confident inaccurate. April 3rd mask recommendation think virus would burned 3 weeks. fact, recommendation cloth mask indication permeability standards. vaccine 100% effective. way make work Society majority get it. ""the people care get it"" going work UK-EU discussion. EU-Astra discussion Astra needs fix whatever seem fit. promised got money UK factories that‚Äôs them. yeah never paid much attention before, he'd guests liked then, i'd tune occasion. always thought uninformed maybe willing listen interested hearing perspectives. seems like listened ignorant ones. cases, perhaps, yet deaths. Checking math:

Per NYT current death rate California 0.14 per 100,000 people per day. typical flu season, US 36,000 deaths mostly ~5 month period 240 deaths per day (or 100 deaths per day annualized). works 0.07 deaths per 100,000 per day flu season 0.03 deaths per 100,000 per day annualized. Right now, threat covid California 2x threat flu typical flu season. death rate dropping continue drop. Dr. Zane: Yes, likely still effective. 42 max days recommended based available data, data. Whatever do, please get second dose, even weeks late. thinks women gold digging whores, podcast great?  doesn‚Äôt everyone get medical advice comedian  fair normal mental response we've go year. going take time effort people snap this. know many believe it, definitely PTSD aspect this. Dr. Kutner: Good news - fine. flexibility timing second dose.  Yes virtually impossible, common phrase, need explain meaning?

And also ‚Äúone million‚Äù phrase throwing there. must forgot Reddit arent allowed make generalizations. EU blocked shipment helped out. stockpiles that's implying??? like movie ""Contagion"" 2011 starring Matt Damon.  That's I've seen outlined lot mandates, to.

Mask fully seated place serves food drink go back time leave table wander around. anyone actually taking medical advice Joe Rogan, they‚Äôre trouble. Dr. Zane: No.  real reason, imo, social reasons. vaccinated people start walking around without masks, unvaccinated people. worst us lie vaccinated go around maskless. way, businesses still require masks enter store. 


I'm still going wear masks even though I'm vaccinated, immunocompromised kids house mitigating risks much possible worth little discomfort. ~~Fauci~~ Reality says Joe Rogan ""incorrect"" ~~in telling young people get vaccinated~~ issues.  That's point think. Cant be. dosent fit narrative die Dr. Zane: That's great question. Vaccines work two ways: protect individuals, protect groups populations aggregate. large proportion vaccinated, benefit cumulative restrictions significantly relaxed. small proportion group vaccinated degree relaxing restrictions account probability unvaccinated developing severe disease. needs change higher proportion people vaccinated. restrictions eliminated. outrage pretty much exists comment sections Twitter posts announcing relaxation. Thank Twitter algorithms fostering anger hate. Georgia's ICU occupancy deaths week, worth. getting voted? said spot on. Well tingling legs since got vaccine (2 days)... Although extreme health anxiety lol either believe free speech don't. Trying get someone agree deplatformed anti-free speech place American culture (if American understand disagree that). 

Curious could explain part statement question harmful lie misinformation? said **he thinks** young healthy people risk need worry getting vaccine. Joe Rogan offer biased commentary, say isnt authority MMA martial arts general ridiculous.  sure lot dumbasses thread.  Right, he‚Äôs saying go party crowded bars, saying don‚Äôt NEED get vaccinated. took point view, want reach herd immunity, ok too, reach without everyone getting vaccinated. Trying guilt force don‚Äôt want it, certainly won‚Äôt make go get Research data said side effects comparable first dose, Moderna side effects vaccines second dose. Fever example 29% Pfizer, 37% Moderna. Lulz Spotify starting suck, tbh. I've account pretty much since beginning. first great finding people's dope playlists, new music. I've realized listen new music, pushing ton music/ podcasts would never listen to. leave album, playlist continue end, get complete garbage...tons shitty remixes (it really pisses go Bob Marley albums shitty remixes Bob Marley), crap spotify trying promote. ""best of"" ton songs I've never selected, leaving music frequently listen to. dislike platform little every time use it. know switch to. I‚Äôm fine vaccination. But, never convince piece cotton stop something needs magnified 30,000x seen. defies logic. Every time person sheds virus exhales, 100s thousands viral particles go everywhere. Cotton doesn‚Äôt shit scenario. mean anyone half brain would move operations lower tax state...why think Florida Texas gained house reps? Also anything üòÇ Dr. Kutner: personally still avoiding eating indoors restaurants, even though fully vaccinated. personal comfort so. People take ~~medical~~ advice celebrities like Joe Rogan Suzanne Somers beyond help.

Joe Rogan dipshit. Dr. Barron: Even though Coronaviruses less prone copying errors like influenza, occur evidenced current circulating variants. booster longevity type immune response opposed mutations themselves.  one? There's lot overlap used among younger conservative audiences. Young, relatively wealthy tech bros love him, they're far blue collar. Life expectancy 70 bad. 55  super helpful. short, relationship (and difference) two groups, percentage many vaccinated people wind hospital? 

So that's vaccine \~90% effective preventing symptomatic infection *as well as* 94% effective preventing hospitalizations? worry, government always always best interests heart. virtually impossible day age myriad reasons. listened JRE since went spotify, said day two later trying stoke fire Bill Burr comment. course matter people hear clip mind made up, pretty clear, know personality, trying rile Bill Burr.   enough state's population refuses get vaccinated can't get X? Try India. disingenuous. Huge reservoirs animal population one. Willful ignorance apparently 4 u(sic). Dr. Kutner: Yes, OK exercise usual day receive vaccine. usual, make sure stay well-hydrated. And, thank getting vaccinated! hear him, worse gets. Fuck guy, literally trump level actively making pandemic worse. 500,000 people died millions family members boiling grief dumb fuck.  really used like Joe Rogan too, much That's great! Based trends far data, would expect see improvements uptake rates vaccine underserved communities mentioned? 

Also, public mapping utilities exist show facilities allow walk-up? problem that, they're listening entertainment content, Joe slips something (at surface level) sounds reasonable false.

And repeats tomorrow, day after, day that. re-telling accepted creditably listeners virtue heard earlier.

It's exact mechanism Limbaugh used convince generation listeners embrace thinly veiled hatred other.

If join types shows 'mid-stream,' crazy sticks much readily listening years. joe rogan incorrect often Giving freedom necessarily encourage people get vaccinated more. fact giving people freedom stuff like gave birth healthcare workers faking vaccines get vaccinated forcing people get vaccinated school nearly eradicated measles illnesses longer see due vaccines.

I'm sure intended arguing point Well look number people fully vaccinated see it‚Äôs lot. look number total infections see it‚Äôs still lot. 100% wrong. 120 deaths USA fully vaccinated individuals.

 


Also vaccines alike. Mine example 70% effecacy preventing severe Covid. Schengen gang  Exactly boring, unfunny meathead huge 18-25 audience? Shit, better move Texas save millimeters income tax. became famous ability speak truthfully feels. allowed opinion England less 700 died 40 years old Covid. That‚Äôs small percentage population. think we're starting hit point country context matter anymore, think important recognize that.

That said, also understand context free look back history recognize actions completed different culture time space well. understand flexibility.

Certainly agree Jones, vaccination (and anti-vaxing he's done past) misinformation (maybe takes cake), among others WORSE we're grading. looking character, good light.

So think question still stands. ""what like guy?

Edit: context phobia (not needles though) totally understand someone phobia needles.

Those true phobia (not fear phobia).. can‚Äôt control body goes flight mode, hyperventilation body whatever get away fear. 

If needle phobia could imagine fainting room needle Joe Rogan ""incorrect"" wide variety subjects dont see people wearing outside unless crowded, like parks, parking lots, walking paths etc data that, Israel. really weird hear people talking need full court press reduce risk ZERO. There's literally nothing world carries zero risk, yet freely time. coronavirus, nothing.  messaging vaccinated people strongly implies marginally beneficial, really beneficial enough get us need be. studies seem indicate erring way much side caution.  

I keep hearing outdoor spread rare concern. Yesterday NPR described ""a drop ink ocean"". Yet that's vaccinated person gets without mask? Go outside? there's virtually risk anyway? Thanks lot. dosen't sound like psycho, stupid person.

A psycopath would person convinced things first place young healthy people urged get vaccine? seems risk weird reaction greater COVID symptoms demographic. early vaccine suppresses symptoms case infection rather slow spread according Fauci impression high risk people would urged get it. younger individuals take well? (I‚Äôm 20 scared take risk getting vaccinated loved one suffered neurological issues vaccine reaction). feeling like risk vaccine greater COVID :( still nr 1 though. Hold Carling. Souls country cremated footpaths. called government can't even take press conference. 
All news coming cities.
People rural India dying felt fever something. 
Soul long back dead. There's oxygen hunt. sounds like really done research here.

/s 2016 harder differentiate two, somewhat understandable.

Um, maybe paying attention. gross comment. nothing US approves see Canada would follow shortly after. ‚Äúattending protest/march peak number cases‚Äù belong? 

As well ‚Äúrioting/looting‚Äù? need know it‚Äôs safe CDC graphic yesterday showed little green person mask vaccinated people eating indoors restaurants. confusing since need take masks eat. Also, I‚Äôm Seattle cases going lately. safe fully vaccinated person eat indoors restaurant area cases going up? obvious Trump idiot let's kid ourselves: one knew going cause much chaos. 

The political climate Reddit time 'Trump sucks Hillary sucks, too, maybe even worse, so... let's write Bernie.'

If Trump clear threat, never would've gotten office. People thought worst, he'd run country like business (and us impression successful business man). UFO guy?

That dude many times seems every time feel like I‚Äôm stupider hearing talk Europe: high pile? Hold beer... maybe til COVID around anymore Oregon serve hot food (at least three items) order hard liquor license. don‚Äôt buy food patron, option to. bartender dealing drunks, imbiber gets drunchies, love it. don‚Äôt data I‚Äôd guess helps mitigate alcohol related injuries deaths. currently like Oct last year Taking numbers worldometer, 400k cases 7.6M population around 5%. Many states 10%+ seeing recent drops. side ""flattening curve"" somewhat successfully need wait longer herd immunity affect start kicking in. Good news opportunity come lot better get vaccination rates 5-10% more. Alberta beginning administer Pfizer 12-15yo chronic conditions. Genuine question: eat mask on?  still experts field podcast. Recently Dr. Shanna Swan Brian Greene. comedian friends come cause comedian friends, shocker know. taking ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre vaccinated, get COVID, can‚Äôt spread it.‚Äù isn‚Äôt true.

Technically speaking, yes. odds catching COVID fully vaccinated slim moot point, me. We're needle-in-a-haystack territory Okay, issue apology revise opinion him. possible wrong Alex Jones podcast, refuse listen anything guy anymore. that's really issue anyway.  .....""chdhdj ya* don‚Äôt think 100% sure vaccine happen get covid still transfer it. I‚Äôd imagine couple months everyone wants get vaccine chance they‚Äôll drop masks. *Haaaneyyy* unless demand falls - case, would unethical ship overseas like information hidden, public forum discussing objective facts.

It's clear last year large proportion US adults act like fing children, public health officials take account messaging. people believe booster shots necessary? reason get flu shots year flu (Orthomyxoviridae) lacks ability correct mistakes genetic code mutates much quickly. Corona virus (like Hep A, Polio, Measles) able correct mistakes change nearly much. Again, what's rational behind getting booster shots? still is. Billy Sides. 

He's smart wise many things, political beliefs halfway ""he's right level"" ""omg that's trash"" Joe Rogan punch drunk imbecile so... listen health advice risk ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è gem. quick. Plays sides comedy. always careful well thought out. it'd help experts change mind every 10 minutes. makes harder others come around  media fear mongering mean, like comedian value political opinions. laziest take ""I know I'm talking they're take money."" ridiculous strawman. CNN hardly positive source news vaccines days would take 50 needles day meant could ditch mask get face back  Dr. Kutner: raise important points. definitely seeing long-term effects COVID infection. Agree important messaging, particularly think vulnerable COVID infection. I'm glad Nia going mainstream lol. Beauty brains. Exactly  amount goes it, think took twice I‚Äôm getting second shot Saturday curious okay exercise usual day? know likely take 12-24 hours feel side effects. Dr. Zane: Yes, unless work health care. need disposable, surgical masks, appropriate PPE based patient's diagnosis. Life must go on, healthy keep everyone indoors time social activity exercise. ‚Äúexperts field‚Äù Cletus standing middle corn field.  masks stop water droplets, popular carriers virus. steal great analogy, claiming mask slow spread virus small like saying dog still chew fence teeth smaller holes.    still hasn‚Äôt explained getting vaccine anything. 

Translated ""I care anyone else happy keep spreading people risk."", basic libertarian thinking. rule joe rogan is, mma, bullshit. it‚Äôs fine take medical advice every celebrity mainstream views. Dr. Zane: Yes. need expeditiously vaccinate populace happens.    come contact covid person would caught covid without vaxxed, 90-95% chance catch it.

Its 9 people 10 total immunity never catch 1 person exposed without vaccine Good him. Another tyrant relinquishes crown. Maybe need take back freedoms all. I'm really sure cryptography actually needed costs pretty much nothing would likely avoid unforseen attack. Assuming internet connection available biggest cost would plastic tint. Lockdowns worked well...  look WA CA OR,,, WA started roll back phase 2 counties... wtf going on?? different states??? They‚Äôve previously said masks needed reason it‚Äôs info graphic. Anything encourages vaccination good thing me. Discounts get Vax Pass nice too. It‚Äôs pretty obvious why: longer go on, fewer people think they‚Äôre still worth could both, people weak immune response due underlying condition, people took much risk weren‚Äôt fully vaccinated. one Israeli studies, people breakthrough cases first second dose couple days second dose, none people 14 days second dose.

After 14 days second dose mrna, 14 days j&amp;j (though 30 days showed even better protection), risks super small. dear god ~~we~~ CDC extremely fucked messaging.  PAYWALL! Masks always theater. Check random controlled studies subject. Mask mandates taken away. still currently place here. governor blocked executing another shut down. might take 5-30% chance getting virus (depending vaccine) reduce 0.001% chance.

There way numbers true. get from? thing, though. outdoor section contains categories ""vaccinated unvaccinated"" ""fully vaccinated"" gatherings. Unfortunately, no. That‚Äôs indefinite time Mask guidance updated **for vaccinated people.** change crowded events, still recommended. Agree, includes me. family vaccinated 1st dose, wanted Covishield based info time Covaxin testing shrouded. opposite happening people asking Covaxin supply. refuse, refuse, right

Waking every two hours crying shit yourself? Yes, good old Midwest hot. 50s morning 90s afternoon feeling 'Seems premature' isnt good reason anything. know want scared forever enjoy living restrictions us want get back normal, 'new normal' literally change I've year now. know everyone pretending changes anything. There‚Äôs nothing wrong going store
Masked up. It‚Äôs history point ship sailed anyway. Hard lockdowns largely unnecessary expecting folks mental difficulties issues nEvEr lEaVe hOme insane seems production process operational advantages. way ramped production impressive, specially compared adenovirus based vaccines. Daily sunscreen face common ""mature"" skincare routines (30+). Check r/skincareaddiction 99% routines there. offense male probably routine- women do, realize it. Sunscreen use face prevalent everywhere among women especially, foundations marketed towards ""older"" women already SPF included, already there.

Vitamin deficiency actually common United States, certainly localized Vermont! Wearing face effect that. Also, sunscreen use affect vitamin levels: Covid early March. Never fever, felt like head cold bad headache. Pfizer recently, side effects starting week later. Fever 103, chills, fatigue (slept 15 hours first night). Fever lasted 3 days 100, couple days 99.4. Finally fever broke using Fitbit, see impact resting heart rate/sleep quality improvements. vaccine higher reaction. That's meant, that's thing thought. 90-95% Pfizer Moderna though, right? second assumption correct, fact getting virus vaccinated means mild case (almost always)? One breweries area started selling Pop Tarts Uncrustables due mandates there‚Äôs anything actually continue part ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù post-covid, it.  risk it? seriously? make simple. make stupid. WEAR MASK. EVERYWHERE. PERIOD. CONSENT!!!!

It's huge issue concert gets amplified music festival setting.  used work venue, saw thought predatory behavior, would go person ask person creeped on, ""do know person, behavior okay?"" Depending answer, tell creeper ""the way acting towards person making uncomfortable, barely imagine feel. rest night security eyes you, behavior persists, here."" 

In music festival everyone participant, everyone needs expected conversations. music festival, dont feel empowered call guy face, friend keep eye go get security. Security take seriously, higher priority active shooter. theres huge brawl one way, possible sexual assault taking place way, training told first go sexual assault. 

Next sobriety consent. see someone sex camp, who's intoxicated sex, that's another huuuge conversation having, especially prevalence ketamine dissociative drugs. 100% guys say ""it's fine, incoherent girlfriend, sex time."" takes place, move explain guy doesnt matter, cant consent right now, call EMTs see girl incoherent, get hell away predatory guy. 

I'm always brought back happened Korn set MTVs Woodstock. Theres massive trigger warning sexual assault. instance, nobody said anything two men brutally assaulted small woman, done her, sent crowdsurfing front, crying eyes out. crowd packed, security couldnt get her, men never got caught. Local shelters described massive uptick sexual assault victims week festival. like people saying can't talk phone mask on. 

It's mask ball-gag. individual perspective, vaccinated.

From public health perspective, prevalence serious cases fallen, seems like happening many regions. would expect 50% total population (not adult population), metrics look good. 

The problem is, one event wants known superspreader event kicked new wave, organizers continue cautious. social problem take time people get comfortable.

If hold date, I'd say likely fall we'll back somewhat normal US adults. friend's dad, 81, died covid India. vaccinated, two jabs astra zeneca. thought supposed 100% effective death? Rural India never accurately tracked deaths cause. probably possible.

True numbers almost certainly much higher this. wait two weeks bro, numbers going go Thanks, read it. downside estimates based models, side good news 1 3 natural antibodies. exactly. seeing graphic nothing 18-30 crowd dont care get vaccinated see theyre healthy low risk, older family members vaccinated dont feel guilt vaxxed going things. 18-30 crowd needs see sense freedom associated getting vaccine theyll go get (speaking member age group talking friends/coworkers range) Forgot clarify, I'm UK Yeah, fuck shit! supposed go Isn‚Äôt skewed? Older people tend less side effects wear mask singing choruses. mean take verses, bridges, prechoruses, etc.? can‚Äôt blame venues canceling 2021 events planning mass gathering events takes long time it‚Äôs issue logistics rather corona safety restrictions. Canceling anything 2022 though lazy. That's one habit definitely keep. role dice kids approved vaccination opportunity get shots would time. right still people can‚Äôt get vaccinated mercy. It‚Äôs horrible wear mask. Hopefully vaccines approved kids end summer fall. soreness get shot lasted first 5 minutes workout next day, felt nothing.

It seems like people know felt sick day dose, almost perfect excuse ditch work day... one would EVER that, lol Pandemic probably biggest event lives, posting affecting literally exactly we've entire year Citans Proff works. 

Better vacines already 

Not proof exits. compare masks sunscreen. questioned grasp correlated outcomes based comment sunscreen. really, no. don‚Äôt kids don‚Äôt know anyone kids except extended relatives back normal. School, play dates etc. risks covid anyone age low people don‚Äôt want keep putting kids‚Äô education social development adults vaccinated. alone room. is! Makes happy see big state low, gives hope get past this. I'm really sick shit. Look xovids death rate maggical increase ten fold.

We know base line expect deaths.

Everyone saying thing China.

Facts deadly thought. Still bad though. Every time guy opens mouth talk EU vaccination schedule, Pfizer/BioNTech producing several million extra doses. mean, let man talk! It‚Äôs complicated.

End day, active infection (asymptomatic mild), probably spread ‚Äì assume can.

It‚Äôs hard tell since you‚Äôre looking 2-5% vaccinated population still contract virus, *and* aren‚Äôt taking precautions protect others (especially unvaccinated) show symptoms, opportunities arise (e.g. friends vaccinated, odds low two group 5 people w/ Pfizer Moderna still get COVID).

Odds decent people careless wrt. spread aren‚Äôt getting vaccine. mean wearing mask outside alone, Biden do? us masks outside first place? There‚Äôs little evidence, hasnt start, suggest wearing mask outside effect. looked stats recently still massive chunk population saying they're getting vaxxed? So...we wait around forever hoping get heads asses? agreed. imagine shitting BUFFALO wings Governor BUFFALO, NY ‚Äúhaving‚Äù wear mask scenarios isn‚Äôt barred wearing mask. 
Some people might cautious others.  what's ""small"" outdoor gathering??  take know anyone age 16. know kidding around. delicious though... said 'likely' 'would'.

Mixing doses already used viruses, provided citations asked for. developed effective vaccine literally matter days weeks discovering virus.

And ya'll worried idiots keeping us becoming space faring society?

Nah, they'll left dust. We'll push without continue live Earth. respect either? It‚Äôs anti-science. That‚Äôs respect swear happens every time cases drop. Testing, course, drops well big brain like ""oh ha ha! cases actually going down, we're testing much!"" Oh damn good point. Yeah guess thinking inland. thinking LA, OC, San Diego. coastal includes partially vaccinated people people virus, far Curevac also come handy too. latecomers particularly helpful stage deliver lot doses second half year, imagine even 2022. Good you. Fact remains developed undeveloped countries done badly well pandemic. deeply American sentiment say since America poorly stupid illiterate countries much worse. third world country could possibly competent government US. reality green vaccinated people going wearing masks, red yellow anti-vaxers going wearing masks. ridiculous. yes, days. Takes 2 shots + couple weeks. month now... Scientists make predictions based data. get new data, update predictions. Well safer everyone groceries delivered. One person ten households shopping reduced spread. Plus let's kid here, back hard lockdown days ppl treated grocery shopping form entertainment. Though privilege sime could afford. Still waiting d√∂√¥mer doctors twitter like Eric Feigl-Ding tweet this. true prevented severe disease people low risk severe disease would decent reason get vaccinated. makes seem like it‚Äôs individual impact. reality high efficacy getting sick thus reduces risk transmitting others much broader effect vulnerability. Stop using ‚Äúdeaths per capita‚Äù use eyes. Italy really bad never point India right now, health system basically collapsed, exhausted resources, tons citizens dying doorsteps hospitals.

And isn‚Äôt even considering India likely undercounting deaths cases. yes, reality worst Covid outbreak country ever faced.  GOT SECOND DOSE LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO honestly think sunscreen mask comparison dumbest one i've seen entire pandemic. think anyone (especially older me! like 20 could let slide) could stupid, somehow managed lower bar even more. Stay safe, mate! mild 2nd shot (little lightheaded activity it), hubs far (almost 48 hours post him) nothing mild sore arm. surprised ok. mean. think airport security is? crap like clear backpacks metal detectors schools?

The difference bit theatre actually works, encourages aren‚Äôt vaccinated continue wearing via social pressure. Hell ya. Go bills made cuddly cactus charming eel! GET IT. Oregon put 11 counties back high risk halting indoor dining. Indoor dining already 25% capacity.  Well may well especially yummy biscuit point. Must Indian site Indians...

It's 100,000. Yay Google + passing interest linguistics... ever gonna able get rid face masks? honest question Vaccinated people safer, 100% fully forever immune. They'll fully safe drive numbers almost zero risk constant exposure. Vaccines tool allow us exit COVID, provide us ramp. end things automatically second individual gets shot. think going false sense security people take one two shots. 8% us population getting 2nd shots. defeats purpose. doubt that's gonna stop ppl partially vaxxed acting like immune stop taking precautions. eat indoors mask lol. deny masks provide protection SICK.

IT appears fundamental misunderstanding purpose mask would also think larger portion contracted Covid vaccine hesitant, meaning overall percentage could slightly higher. exactly deny scientific method? statement made denies scientific method? 

We still experimental phase vaccines. Indications possible side effect made, need researched. data flows in, better understanding exact prevalence. Hopefully (and *most* *likely*) clots remain low-incidence event. experimentally corroborated statements made.

If anything, telling *you* following scientific method. ""We know, believe might low prevalence"" possible scientific position.

In addition, exact prevalence **is** important ethical perspective. true clotting prevalence higher IFR certain age groups, might (repeat, might!) become unethical force people take vaccine order participate daily life. reasoning philosophical standpoints cannot force someone something harmful (even harm minuscule). mind conceding point. realize arguing choice words, get hung figures speech.

My point science refines predictions new data comes in, that's large part makes powerful tool. I'm pushing vaccine hesitant life get vaccinated. may fail, worth trying. suggest everyone else same. going maskless concerts Chicago, maskless anything. plan metric lift mandate CDC declares masks unnecessary times. optimistic mask compliance barber. think average barber probably hole wall ventilation. wear substandard masks leak, i.e. N95s. also see touch masks, pull noses time. imagine shop gets saturated aerosols fairly quickly. legit good news! cynical person would say getting press good news, continual bad news allows politicians exercise continued control people's lives.

Possibly related: benevolent CDC decreed vaccinated people may outside unmasked themselves! impressed generosity freedoms deign return people? thankful CDC given blessing. Praise CDC, blessings flow! Praise CDC, creatures below! Praise CDC above, heavenly host! Praise Fauci, Biden, Holy Wallenda! Amen!

Sorry, last paragraph bit non sequitur. I'm pissed--but take away legit good new cases. workers Around people tired hear talk anything except Covid. It‚Äôs weird isn‚Äôt it? know COVID gives immunity speed herd immunity bunch, don‚Äôt even talk it. Makes wonder... electronic gossip circle algorithm ""figures out"" turns circle jerk biased information reinforces whatever information bubble reside in.

But, hey...cat pictures, right? helps, 100% locked still seeing friends outside nothing else. that‚Äôs haven‚Äôt determined mildly immunosuppressive meds I‚Äôm reduce effectiveness vaccine not. preliminary data first shot one four people meds antibodies. I‚Äôm waiting data second shot feeling completely vaccinated. friend household member solid organ transplant. like 17% chance making antibodies second shot. Hoping isn‚Äôt going make people suddenly less ignorant unfortunately. NY cases gone 66% month. vaccines work  England prove hard getting spreading virus ignoring science ‚Äòfear mongering‚Äô. correct general understanding vaccine people have.

This vaccine, reinfection virus. extremely low, line people think. alternative data suggest share it! Someone uni halls got twice. Everyone kitchen self isolate 2 weeks times got it.... Fun af I'm continually astounded well Moderna BioNTech/Pfizer doing. mean they're majority heavy-lifting around world right now.

I remember US missing initial targets, positive efficacy yet, on. anxiously awaiting Israeli data seeing seem take forever turn tide. got production scaled figured out, vaccines wildly effective safest profiles we've ever seen, Israel crushed spread, creating hundreds millions doses quarter, pivoting hose vaccinations EU rest world, letting scaling production planning worst-case scenarios like boosters, etc.

Just wildly impressed two companies technologies point. already four endemic coronaviruses circulating globally us, all, immunity against.

You know get aches tickly cough assume cold flu? Well sometimes one coronaviruses, too. symptoms bad, though, thanks repeated exposure got child built B-cell immunity. Without B-cell immunity previous exposure, symptoms could quite bad first exposure later life. That's COVID posed problem older people, novel there's prior exposure childhood harmful body could lay foundations defence.

Anyway, point is, relevant comment: hope really spread like wildfire schools would contribute overall population's immunity, would stand children good stead later life if/when they're re-exposed. Baby steps, feel comfortable yet stick outside sit near back away people. week wedding maybe hit outdoor restaurant lunch. husband didn‚Äôt sleep headache 24 hours. otoh slept next day whole night. muscle aches extreme fatigue. day after. plus tinnitus 3 days, supposedly uncommon. worth it.  knew soon masks politicized going away anytime soon. They've become symbol ""team"" lot people, one first kind certain team. longer vaccinations go on, less masks truly stopping spread, symbol. think useful certain situations, religious fervor people kinda creepy.

I think election US would calm divisiveness around masking. Boy wrong lol Look Mr Dscarr. followed CDC mask social distance guidelines I'm getting vaccinated... durring whole pandemic masking inside joke. need mask seated go bar butttt situated need mask. really seems theatrical. deny masks provide protection SICK. I'm done it.  Plus Covid danger many fewer infected people country. regular guy Joe Sixpack wasn‚Äôt likely encounter infected person time going business, Nurse Jackie Doctor Smith would far likely to. 

Now masks freely available Covid widespread. Joe Sixpack can‚Äôt go store assume won‚Äôt encounter someone may Covid. Nurse Jackie Doctor Smith enough supply don‚Äôt re-use masks days time daily contact positive patients. 

I don‚Äôt understand people think situation rigid stuck March 2020 thinking new guidelines come conditions ground change  good, everything fine. Yes, Moderna ambitious. sole company MRNA approach scaled easily. Adenovirus vaccines haunted shortcomings targets. Might problem principle approach. Although, hand, Indian vaccine producer generally produces satisfying numbers might management problem AZ.  So.. Obey authority remain ""safe"". Got message. Probably need chart that. 2nd Pfizer Monday dealing side effects yesterday. Felt like bad flu - body aches, fever, fatigue, headache. Feeling lot better morning luckily. Portugal getting 1.9M vaccines April.
No news unexpected shipments :( vaccines 90% effective, nothing 100% effective. still get sick even vaccine, though illness milder would been. ... you‚Äôre literally commenting headline one thing disagree them.

It's another care said. refuse acknowledge portion population even though thought third US. Previous infection makes like vaccinated person unvaccinated person gotten covid, act though I'm vaccinated.  OOOOO watch got bad ass believe two issues different. Supply raw materials packed vaccines freed much possible. IP discussion conclusively implicated supply constraints already process international IP law allow countries side step medicine licencing times emergency. two factors worth keeping mind considering IP argument gets looked scepticism some. CDC tracks breakthroughs cumulative tally, agree would smart show number daily stats Sure, can't ski surf time, AC gets expensive heating oil (I lived Boston basis comparison). definitely tradeoff. already keep house 80 degrees summer costs much cool lower.

I'm pretty worried climate change going affect weather here; extreme heat gets even extreme, going get really bad. Mmm think denying service due medical condition, perceived medical condition, illegal. matter want spin it. believe long covid elucidated(1 Billion investment USA's NIH) help people chronic conditions cause similar symptoms?\[Discussion\] mean friggin better. Mission Accomplished 1/3 herd immunity. (sigh). say 'really easily' either, said 'much easily think', correct general understanding vaccine people have. repeatedly changing words fit complaint. apply thought Reddit commenters pretty much anything. Anecdotal also, neither parents side effects outside sore arm shots. sore arm shots slight fatigue 2nd super mild. I‚Äôm male late 20s. fever also. Probably similar better two vaccine doses doubt enough time passed know long immunity lasts long term makes way much sense! it'll happen unfortunately Blind faith too. wish people would say ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm scared returning things loved. pandemic given deep anxiety need work through.‚Äù I‚Äôm way sympathetic repeating false claims could lead people get vaccinated comfort know time, there's good discussion vaccine prior infection: big ones won‚Äôt held 2022. take long plan really held much earlier even public health authorities allow it. may see Q4. Good math, assumption people gotten Covid less likely gotten vaccine people told get first covid? thought process everyone chance months don‚Äôt give shit risking refuse vaccine. It‚Äôs choice there‚Äôs gonna point slowly go towards sense normalcy. willful ignorance disability

choosing believe conspiracy theory facebook medical professionals around world disability  Calling ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù scientific prediction extremely charitable. 

Idk read scientific literature all, sort dramatic language extremely frowned upon.  one expect fully vaccinated person still wear mask. think catches guard.. don‚Äôt need it! Yes, exactly! I'm vaccinated I'm sad life changed much. :( guess stand outside people feet away without wearing mask... (shh) before? Kids really screwed chart. still can‚Äôt get vaccinated. No, like ""man says he's expert 100% wrong ignored effects vaccines reason people still listen him."" Welcome magical world self-selection amplification bias :). Btw, hunch also applies reddit. hope someone, one day make detailed sociological study deep persuaded reddit (or least, lot big subreddits) way reflective 'general society'. there's possibility Pharma able isolate nearly mutations attacking things common. That's layperson speak double Pfizer Moderna looking addition boosters specific variants. Well yeah, prediction another 30,000 deaths next year something. equivalent bad flu year, obviously something live want freedoms. Thank much info! cutting/pasting main point us hit paywall. 

Definitely something considered evaluating need continuing mask mandates. Although also think vaccine‚Äôs ability limit severity illness unfortunately still contract also weighed equation. really feeling like light end tunnel. There's unavoidable interactions deal regular basis feel way comfortable 2 weeks already, like live community bathroom fights people wearing masks common area. That's something finally stopped caring year, nice. I'll probably go dinner father soon enough, he's waiting lol. started dating someone beginning we're never actually eat anything couple...that's gonna weird. 

It's going take time bet I'll get used quickly. Thanks. misread. still get much easily think

At point state get likely non-symptomatic generally quite mild.

Saying ""you still get covid really easily before"" good message spread Even Supreme Court gets things wrong sometimes medical pros saying herd immunity could never happen/will based world soon get vaccinated...there major parts world might get long time hard store get long open borders virus still coming in. Completely? while. situations they‚Äôll unnecessary vaccinated people. I‚Äôm officially fully vaccinated disillusionment really kicked ass. could nothing meaningfully changing. 

Time keep trudging along, guess. many fully vaccinated people America hospitalized?

498 April 20, 2021. no, thankfully one company working vaccines Additionally studies people health conditions protected vaccination. Blood cancers, organ transplant recipients barely mesurable antibodies. study going test people various autoimmune disorders hopefully find least get enough immune response protection.

a woman state died getting vaccines. multiple myeloma family thought 'pretty safe. Still contracted covid19 two weeks 2nd vaccination unlike breakthrough cases died it.

unfortunately millions people health issues still safe let guard around unvaccinated people Yes, produced European, Indian South Korean facilities. None UK, effective export ban, importing rough numbers. Ahh, excellent thank you. 

The point stands different study comparing efficacy studies isn‚Äôt quite simple looking numbers. many many people still isolating

What even basing on? feeling? don‚Äôt like get immunity actually COVID üòÜ Yeah, guess see talking people get vaccinated.

My point still fit group 1, even though I've vaccinated, nothing life changed. local ordinances changed me. still required everything vaccination required vaccinated. Getting vaccinated changed legally allowed county *not one bit*. still legally required mask stay six feet away everyone.

If I, got vaccine soon allowed to, frustrated ""nothing changed,"" imagine frustrated someone fence vaccine would feel. well revisit month see theyre still recommending masks outside vaccinated (in situations shown above), nothing change inside I'm parent too, always ""any"" chance hospitalization death kid, myriad causes.  balance mitigation serious risks letting kid enjoy life.  make crazy otherwise. 

Personally, last 13+ months hard children young people we're going make kids feel like lepers making mask/distance private gathering mostly-vaccinated adults healthy kids. follow rules public, course, decided letting NORMAL private social gatherings worth low risk catching virus thankfully extremely low risk serious complications death. I'm putting life hold. still hope everyone gets vaccinated.  Hey wanna anti-vax/science/mask‚Ä¶ let Darwin thing. half time spend restaurant spent without actively eating. seated, ordering waiting food, waiting pay bill, aren‚Äôt actively shoving something pie hole. reduce transmission rate half that‚Äôs pretty good, especially something transmissible Covid. better eating outdoors getting takeout, sure, type still willing eat indoors currently yeah guidelines actually still make sense. many fully vaccinated people America hospitalized? It‚Äôs low number messaging ‚Äúyou end hospital get vaccine‚Äù it‚Äôs true. REALLY hope Golf one things loosen soon. case counts steadily going finally Ontario, ICU count plateaued - would bet people golfing by... Around end May! Maybe early June Unvaccinated people wear mask - dining outdoor restaurant friends multiple households

... someone want break news CDC put food mouths? CDC comes says vaccinated need mask valid. Otherwise still need mask? Also grandparents' death pneumonia, pneumonia caused covid-19 says certificate that's hospital gets money old anyway covid bad worry stench Depending quality airbag deployment systems- perform better safely seatbelts. think point vaccines Tesla airbag deployment system vaccines one shitty bag pops old Ford Pinto. smart went home. thing there, first less 2 weeks since 10% vaccinated. Second 40% vaccinated would already counted first 40%. 49%.

It currently 24.3%, 30.5% mention everyone likely got december-february able get tested, likely diagnosed pneumonia something along lines.   I‚Äôm asking don‚Äôt get way hire good advisors. Biden that. Trump failed that. think returning 5m AZ doses India personally mentions getting booster shot potentially every 12-18 months. I‚Äôm totally fine that, word yet you‚Äôll need get mRNA shot first round vaccination or, available, you‚Äôd able to/have get shot similar J J one? Sorry last part seemed oddly phrased‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs still early lol Yes, do. Plenty. Maybe Doctors Without Borders activity India? I'd rather wrong direction one. could due fact less people getting tested because... know... less people feeling sick even get tested! Seems like waste money develop implement system like this. protecting people get vaccine. vaccine works. reach herd immunity people want protection gotten it. go trouble protect people get vaccine. Yeah, understand either. vaccines amazing highly effective, still need take swiss cheese approach drive numbers, people commit quicker we'll drive numbers. work Urgent Care. see every day. can't help it. Honest question, actually know anyone still isolating extent last March/April? Even locked people know basically back living normal lives wearing mask public. reporting bias. People something interesting happen (e.g. experiencing side effects) much likely talk it. Got 2nd dose yesterday. Slight fever feels like bad hangover, overall bad. Asinine 100% correct word describe it! Exactly said yesterday lol

The worst enforcement one night last summer wanted glass wine dinner. Went restaurant, ordered slice cheesecake glass wine, waiter told desserts count toward rule. make scene waiter restaurant's fault rules ambiguous, annoying. known though? first time CDC said it? Americans quick blame countries eat strange animals, kissing pigs county fairs.  mean 68,3% antibodies, 31,7% not.

Instead mixed fully + unvaccinated kinda defeats purpose Dr. Fauci's messaging fully vaccinated friends/family visit indoors without masks. I'm medical processional all, I've read people better immune systems stronger reactions immune response that's making feel like garbage. maybe means would less bad time covid? I'm really sure. small sample group 6 people AZ first shots, 5 side effects worth cancelling plans over.

5 us combination headache, fatigue, chills, muscle/joint pain. Onset 24 hours shot, lasted 24 hours so. 40's. 2 women, three men. That's cause large chunk country continues sit ass home get vaccinated. suppose could interpret way

also, realized really comparable entry left side suggested. maybe better comparison would Fully vaccinated people * Visit unvaccinated people (including children) single household low risk severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks physical distancing

i'm guessing left side would probably yellow/red w/ mask right side would green w/o mask dumbest thing chart fact they‚Äôve letting people indoor dine almost year without vaccine completely invalidates rest shit. imagine they‚Äôre counting people even taking 2 seconds try make sense recommendations. 

Eating indoors amount dangerous anything else indoors without mask. It‚Äôs like barber different species friends go dine with. poses exact threat you. misread last line prior post apologies there. still explained I'm looking why. saying stating science isn‚Äôt fear mongering.

To wrap back around original comment replied fully vaccinated, virus bounces around unvaccinated folks, continue mutate. Whether vaccinated folks safe future strains impossible say.

This fearmongering response someone saying fully vaccinated safe. Saying people spread virus chances mutate much science saying often eat hot dogs higher chance choking one. duh statement one leads other. really worry choking hot dogs eat risk? No, risk incredibly small even one common foods adults choke on. Similarly here, really know risk mutation fearmongering know high risk specifically risk mutation evade current ways people gaining immunity. Stop dramatic. forgot.. grandparents died friend reduced lung function bad 100% truth. everyone got vaccinated things would stop getting canceled. No, assume immunity roughly uniform across population. said week two ago fine fully vaccinated people different households meet indoors groups. neighbors fully vaccinated want 'Who's Afraid Virginia Woolf' kind night, go it! like actual video step. similar side effects made wonder meant would gotten sick contracted COVID. Certainly happy vaccinated now, either way. understand. hard pivot mindset, remember vaccinated got best protection available. done best yourself. fun. Buffalo ny chance? Uhm....no. mistake Brazil. B117 took P1 proved stronger. just...sing. There‚Äôs billions people living developing countries would love so-called dilemma. 'to look good'. events question take many months possibly even year plan without certainty can't go ahead late 2021 2022 even pandemic restrictions longer exist then.

As others said, insurance big factor also. think that's good thing honestly though. One big argument ""I can't breathe wearing mask"". Well Biden long period time fine... Maybe Modi going Boris ""let bodies pile high"" Go back life risk minuscule you.  Everyone know received moderna got hit hard 2nd shot. Either people know around unlucky moderna high side effect chance.  know leading cause child mortality dead caregivers?

Doesn't matter children killed restrictions now. pale comparison orphans ruined country restrictions lifted prematurely. Let's stop pretending restrictions monstrous policy kill people cruelly alternatives. restrictions alternative. want see happens lifted ignored. Better yet, follow news see quickly India buckles government collapses. give June deaths Covid country alone surpass 1 million politicians fleeing country. firefighters dunno nurses National guards parents oh never mind Actually, 39% amount started vaccination, 31% fully vaccinated, around 30K people getting right now. frankly bothers much masks, understand hesitancy all. fear even fully vaccinated individual (well, almost, abput week) parents never safe thing here. :(  indoor mask requirements vaccinated people largely enforcability issue. could definitely regional.

Masks lockdowns social distancing measures buy us time vaccine available. first three measures able get R value ~1.5. number 1 means still spreading. lower R value faster goes away. vaccines hope get R value 0.4. whole point create dead end street virus. vaccine accomplishes rate 94-95% (Pfizer).

I'd say likely opposite. numbers probodies? must balanced analysis. metrics drive reopening? guess case count less 5/100k (could go low 2), asymptomatic rate less 1% &lt;could go low 0.2%), vaccination rate 70% eligible population. this, think sports venues fully open up, big concerts, etc (masked). risk, many would take it, I'd hope venues would responsible offering vaccines, etc. 

When cdc say masks period? significant percentage people simply refuse get shots children eligible till end year, believe full year continue mask use. Maybe March next year full masks thus full normalcy. defines crowded outdoor event?

What walk, run, bike city sidewalk relatively high pedestrian traffic? need wear mask then? need mask pass people?

There still ambiguity guidelines. title absolutely state that. 

I read report. studied people 7 months, therefore results account 7 months. *not* state anywhere 7 months natural immunity declines. 

I‚Äôm antivaxxer means like come dude paid degree stuff know research done. can‚Äôt make conclusions outside scope research. Someone pretty strong? first dose Moderna arm felt like damn donkey kicked me!

But side effects apart first day feeling kind tired. I'm beginning think people refuse get vaccine point selfish jerks nothing work besides cash payments vaccines. would edit comment simply true parents worried covid horrified lot common illnesses activities kids exposed pandemic. write vaccine distribution already one. ok virus powerless seated eating/drinking. second stand though! Instant infection! Well, taking cues Fauci. He's fully vaccinated, wears two masks, says dangerous eat restaurant go theater. So, get vaccine continue live Zoom life. people see that, think ""huh, really see point getting vaccinated."" Fauci, CDC, still locking despite vaccinated anti-vaxxers. Bhutan unimaginably wealthy leader global vaccine apartheid. /s EU pays lowest amount vaccines, blasts public, sues AstraZeneca, threatens AstraZeneca manslaughter charges. people wonder EU behind comes vaccinations.  I‚Äôm outside Chicago. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated point everyone close least half vaccinated. Maybe that‚Äôs part I‚Äôm feeling less sympathetic anti vaccine crowd. EU spent months party managed get price AZ cheap, know able supply time? strange. Maybee Africa wants contingencies place get vaccines quicker. New England got anything? That's *Science* *‚Ñ¢* works. people going assert natural immunity good enough magic jab required, gonna cough evidence. Otherwise rest us going go lives get immunity one way another. Plus, US set share 60 million AstraZeneca doses hopefully least going poorer nations. hope that‚Äôs beginning, think we‚Äôll probably reach point supply outweighing demand UK does. let's discourage wanting get vaccinated tell still wear masks activities? ""creating vaccines end pandemic"" get wealthy countries credit? big mark them. business social engineering, regardless whether ""the ends justify means"". chart comparison showing rate decline vaccine-elicited antibodies seropositive people?

And comment anyway anti-vaccine? think past year proven that, general sense, people don‚Äôt give crap mental health. *did*, would‚Äôve lot serious discussion psychological social (and economic) effects Covid policies, much earlier path striking reasonable balance. Instead, whole hell lot shaming callousness towards us suffered mightily this.  cabin loses pressure, put damn mask ***first***. viral load studies? ask high-risk person life Covid recently came okay without hospitalization, two week quarantine moderate symptoms clearing own. person gather unmasked people, likely picked wearing mask running errands doctor's things. expectation person got would much worse outcome, perhaps made better infected small viral load.

This comment advocacy restrictions masking forever. person gotten vaccinated month earlier likely problem.

Edit: I'm finding detail this. wish public health experts discussed viral load more. may resonated people sad thing views probably echo lot people. CDC needs start telling people yesterday vaccines reduce spread. I've seen many studies posted subreddit literally entire country (Israel) data look at. know they're holding back seems foolish Serum Institute India, partnered AstraZeneca PLC make vaccine company developed University Oxford. Output also constrained limits imposed U.S.

While time government [is refusing UN supply chain US identified critical supply issues sending SII. still holding religious events millions. Expect get worse gets better. I'm worried people getting vaccinated insofar A) want people needlessly die, B) want hospitals get overwhelmed although hospitals US pretty good shape right (at least live), C) want go back fucking normal going require case numbers drop, vaccines incredible job facilitating. 

I care someone wants wear mask socially distance end time. want shit, got vaccinated want everyone else get vaccinated. opinion, I'd pissed cause extends time restrictions lifted wear fucking mask many things doors possible. there's Joe Motherf'ing Rogan.... Yeah bit tiring jogger around I've gone path least resistance masked whenever even eyesight anyone else bc got tired getting yelled at. Thankfully burbs sometimes jog whole 6 miles barely seeing another person. Pfizer like ""oh, 7M doses scheduled week? let's make 8M"". many cases hospital vaccine supposed reduce symptoms mild? Almost everyone goes back second dose, percent first dose far representative state vaccine acceptance. Ultimately, mask mandate lifted going based politics rather hard science. please love good, keep washing hands getting vaccinated "" infact found sending doses EU UK""

This proven wrong. think repeat enough become true? Sore arm here. Glad hear experience unusual. Seems like squeaky wheel getting attention true here. You‚Äôre vaccinated give fuck?  LOL read lines dude. NOBODY suggesting music festivals sole determining factor ‚Äúlit‚Äù summer. It‚Äôs pretty clearly one many components OP specifically harping on, subject article.

Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Go get vaccinated. Damn it, think someone despises covid much rogan would telling people left right get vaccinated end sooner   Read task middle. determine vaccinated (or ppl mingling vaccinated). Then, look appropriate column. Color coded regarding risky task is, whether wear mask.

That probably made confusing. Lol. Hmmmm. Come think cousin die daughter super forthcoming COD. vaccine equal absolute immunity. provides increased protection. think rain coat, helps prevent water reaching you, jump pool still going get wet. ( preps immune response still overwhelmed massive amount virus.)  control; control people always frothing mouth about? I'm you. small sacrifice greater scheme things anyway. Respectfully, disagree (along seemingly least 8 people). unvaccinated one point perfectly comfortable hanging friends long masked distanced. I'd assume would true unvaccinated masked coworkers, even quite distanced, fact would vaccinated would ""cancel"" out, protected. Stop prolonging pandemic ostracizing people.  effective medicine kids combat symptoms Covid become risk flu. still lot data long term effects kids. Inflammatory disease, heart conditions, appendicitis, etc effects kids experienced far. 

Not OP I‚Äôm mindset 1 yr old. LO get sick child. fully aware ready. lifetime problems might lasting effects disease still little data much different flu illnesses known tracked decades. likely answer. veg diet. 20% COVID patients required hospitalization. 

Mortality 1-2% intact healthcare system. 

We know healthcare system India collapsed. 20% COVID patients needlessly die lack hospital beds. think would call sub informed. really angry CDC acknowledging covid real US still world wide top ~10 outbreak even vaccinations are. I‚Äôm done wearing mask personally. I‚Äôm forced to, sure, we‚Äôve fine Florida cases way down. It‚Äôs like COVID isn‚Äôt thing anymore seeing masks. girlfriends hospital isn‚Äôt really seeing hospitalizations anymore. people getting vaccinated. can‚Äôt get vaccine masks literally causing breathing problems.  Yeah revised CDC guidelines say Biden scenario need wear mask. personal feeling executive branch needs get page exude consistency. Obviously better last administration (a low bar) kind mixed messaging harmful overall goal putting pandemic behind us. Europeans want risk groups vaccinated first, creepy antivaxxers dont want kids ""poisoned""  Good news, India world. need vaccines get. Crank get delivered everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Kick covid twigs berries get thing OVER. fully vaccinated really wanted go back group Pilates classes bc helps back pain. Unfortunately studio requires coaches wear masks I‚Äôm confused policy. would everyone else situation? I‚Äôm 31 smile lines eyes. thanks *that* feeling morning.

I avoid sun like plague though. said issue. matter both. US lifted blockade. long IP issue resolved? US several established routes this. used power single time since 80's. Anecdotally, parents got second Moderna shots Monday afternoon, chills, fevers, felt exhausted day Tuesday. feeling much better morning. would say yes, *and* seasonality. Compare last spring. Anecdote equal empirical data. different people saying ""I know 2 people hospitalized vaccine."" B.1.1.7 significant immune escape either, would make sense see massive waves reinfection UK variant. South African variant (B.1.351) would carry larger risk reinfection, even much lot people think. would actually respected said ‚Äúif vaccinated follow laws business requirements otherwise masks, distancing required‚Äù

Instead monstrosity. J&amp;J contamination issue must primary manufacturing facility. Shipments next weeks reduced 90%. Well one, im even going acknowledge refuse get vaccinated point. that's double mutant- new triple mutants? d100. lands anythin 1 die

Do proofread? There‚Äôs chance children didn‚Äôt spread much, reality now, school never fully open cases lowest, hope recover well child get vaccine available bother? stop find something else talk about, plus still find vaccination 100% stopping transmission infection talk anyway. always pick choose numbers arguments whatever looks good them.

In mean time us care vaccinated help overall situation still wearing mask indoors. Mind = Blown people get tested symptoms.

That means real number even higher asymptomatic cases tested. 30% positivity rate horrible however slice it. vaccine 100% effective. remaining 5 percent relies others around infected 6 people differing vaccinations, 12 everyone vaxed. Solved you. almost like vaccines work. 

Further evidenced fact states lower vaccination rates dropping rather plateauing best. Deep South whole, example, worst vaccination rates yet seeing decline (it's mostly flat). According man, France going miss vaccination programme proceeding apace ‚Äì quite apace enough hit France‚Äôs target 20m first jabs 15 May. last night 14.5m first jabs given. 300,000 day needed hit target current average around acceleration promised. Plenty doses available. 220,000+ slots ‚Äì 20 jabs ‚Äì untaken across France yesterday. partly ‚Äì wholly ‚Äì due AZ-refusal. govt considering jabbing 55‚Äôs earlier planned

Bear mind UK hit 30 million first doses 15th March. France can't even hit 20 million 15th May, they're going fully vaccinated summer. UK France similar sized populations. Work COVID wing hospital. Lots folks testing positive COVID following second shots. 4 weeks plus after, others early one week. 

Most ones end hospital careful following shot. also protection people cannot vaccinate yet fault own, children. vaccinated, still carry COVID give kids life, random child encounter. really want risk stop wearing mask months earlier? 13 months, more? would rather take precautions months confident herd immunity stop taking precautions prematurely end another mess. it‚Äôs going down. city spiking wrong way. mean way takes care it‚Äôs uighur friends? course, case every country world. narrative Reddit, though, EU failing badly vaccination effort, reality 6 weeks behind US. Hundreds times read EU done vaccinating adult population year end, realistic. least one constant mess iconic duo CDC poor messaging. Hungary touch multiple people don‚Äôt know outdoors without moving? Crowded.

Honestly people complain guidelines way presented. Make simple people ask ‚Äòcrowded‚Äô. Make specific people say sure that‚Äôs good X situation, X situation variable Z situation can‚Äôt possible follow different guidelines. Put somewhere middle you‚Äôve got sides complaining need more/less confusing guidelines.   forget weather. know exactly impact summer weather transmission based well controlled virus last summer think pretty significant bad CDC recommendations continue ignore population. hasn‚Äôt established. There‚Äôs yet study showing substantial decline immune protection infection. Vaccination probably durable also don‚Äôt know long immunity lasts. Getting vaccinated safer option given uncertainty though. anywhere *have actually wear mask* outdoors? I'm fully vaccinated NYC mask mandate stopped wearing mine outdoors absolutely zero people said anything.  Yes, should. Yeah, felt like someone pretty strong punched arm that's it. feel little scatterbrained first day, like bit brain fog, went away first cup coffee could kinda tired. choose make big show today lifting outdoor mask guidance.

That applies vaccinated people uncrowded settings.  bad news everyone.

Meh assume substantial majority vaccinated people previously infected, yes. think makes sense. 

There obviously % already contracted virus, disagree with.

So let's say 40-45% disease, around 15% vaccination. 

I believe major vaccination push week, Belgium see cases plummet week two herd immunity indeed reached 70%! bars movies new york always bowls peanuts somthing? scienfific give scientific reasons post link proofs rather call censorship?

Is true indeed still spread virus vaccination, smaller way?

Is true different vaccines different efficiency different variants virus? Ah shit well played One twenty assumes 100% baseline infection rate exposed.

95% efficiency means 20 unvaccinated people would infected, 1 vaccinated individual would circumstances. Well, AZ would delivering promised April, nothing more. far delivered 25% anyone Philadelphia area needs shot, Convention Center Center City Esperanza North Philly taking walk-ins 5pm 8pm, respectively. They've got 3,000 Pfizer doses need used today. carry spread like adults, even they‚Äôre asymptomatic. *Statistically speaking*, spread even adults due less diligent hygiene practices. think depends whether continue care CDC says long term. They, all, recommend one alcoholic beverage per sitting (and non child-bearing-age women, regardless intent get pregnant). raw cookie dough, red meat cooked medium. Yeah, I've noticed pretty crowded. think food rule game change. I've definitely called bar days/nights early recent months want buy anymore food. tons contrarian commenters sub sudden? Russian Chinese farms get contract? 25-50% guess. similar chronic conditions probably viral source treatments help little extra work required. However lot chronic conditions well understood, progress one cause expected mean progress whatever is.

For probably set back. rarer condition find effort investigate condition diverted solving problem, progress would made isn't. course helped diverted person comes across treatment thought also breakthrough needed.

I make predictions anything specific though. generic enough can't wrong. know two people reinfected around three month mark uk strain. sicker second time around reduce transmission rate half that‚Äôs pretty good, especially something transmissible Covid.

It‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôre unvaccinated reduces 20% 10% encounter someone COVID. It‚Äôs another thing you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre reducing base 1%. mention overwhelming majority people meet don‚Äôt COVID, real probabilities much lower. 

I‚Äôm interested wearing mask everywhere fractionally reduce already small chance. don‚Äôt mind putting mask bites, that‚Äôs business, far tell, nobody else it, good reason. vaccines work. evidence support PCRs returning 1% false positives? False positives definitely happen due occasional errors, typically errors involve contamination - lower actual infection rate, lower likelihood false positives due contamination. 

The type common ""false positive"" (residual viral material post infection) really false positive - test working designed, picking remnants infection yet cleared. handled already data (the individual testing positive within 2-3 month window count new unique infection). 

Plenty countries widescale testing last year (late Spring/early Summer) got near-zero case load tens thousands tests refutes idea PCRs regularly return false positives done correctly. don‚Äôt say.... Buffet orgies: wanna get eaten eating out. indiana accepting walk-ins j j right motor speedway think long enough since said one turning vaccine previously infected. honestly remember ever said. back vaccines first became available healthcare workers?  quite sure means‚Ä¶ sincere disputing considered asshole?

You seem one issue. say 70 hundred 7 10 simplified? already pretty busy, it'll wild. I've getting lot offers bartend bar manage last days. I'm going working like crazy get guys drinks love You‚Äôre answering question‚Äîif vaccinated, protected. Study says 95% effective seven months. Moderna 90% effective six months. Pfizer 91% effective six months. missing? Yeah, old houses money pits. seem compared UK parts Europe, Americans seem much worried kids getting virus? I'll wear one businesses still required state, whole friend group fully vaccinated now. We're getting together wearing them. Follow line thinking conclusion - nothing 100% COVID endemic, plan never take mask? acceptable answer long-term? places ""temporary"" means CDC says one needs mask anymore, indication policy change. see much twitter people getting mad healthy Americans want wait vaccine want it.

People maybe mad thats herd immunity works. least thats annoys me.

Herd immunity varies virus virus based percentage population needs immune. lot people refuse vaccine, impeding countries ability reach good level herd immunity. I'm mainly annoyed one would like reach form normalcy soon, lot people give shit. People complain masks whatever pandemic related issues, yet want whats needed get there. dont hate people whatsoever, feel, based studies I've read, there's justification wait believe vaccine effective...

It effective I'm unsure would say ""if believe"". Unless referring specifically effective.

Moderna: 91.4% effective doses
Pfizer: 95% effective doses
J&amp;J: 66% effective (i would reccomend taking one learned causing issues patients rare cases)

These 3 authorized reccomended vaccines within United states. point however, every vaccine ever made going 100% effective, level protection better protection. top cases called ""breakthrough cases"" still infected even vaccine, happens vaccines rare. top that, room 20 people sick, even vaccine, viral load exposed could much great immune system able fight effectively resulting getting able spread loved ones risk vaccine, cares get sick want get shot?

Like said last answer, could still get it. rare, happen. mean vaccine effective, means rare cases still occur. herd immunity needed.


I proffesional. I'm merely giving understanding vaccines virus based research I've done. Please due diligence. makes don‚Äôt go hospital

And people age (20s) hear that, think ‚Äúoh, well wouldn‚Äôt going hospital covid anyways, vaccine‚Äù Michigan dropping like rock, definitely helped nationwide curve! Nearly every state that‚Äôs dropping, started dropping exact time. County 67% eligible receiving least one dose, 41% fully vaccinated.  Contra Costa County, 68 percent partially vaccinated, 47% fully vaccinated.  Marin County, 81% received one dose nearly 59% fully vaccinated.  County half eligible partially vaccinated ¬†40% fully vaccinated.  San Francisco, 69% eligible received least one dose, 45% fully vaccinated.  Mateo County nearly 70% eligible receiving one dose 45% fully vaccinated.  Clara County 65% least one dose 37% fully vaccinated.  bar around (in Brooklyn) followed rule anyway.  Summer city going absolutely wild. this, curfews gone, likelihood major outbreak basically zero, soooooo many people going want go out. questionable study fair. Delhi's recordable statistics (ie. hospital admissions hospital deaths) low 4-6 weeks ago. Valid point opinion don‚Äôt think kids 1 year old sense what‚Äôs going moment üòÇ depends state live in. Yeah that's straight idiotic. person someone would never want conversation with. opinion bad people refuse wear masks indoors think vaccine 5g chip No, no. Little babies young children need see human faces. fuck's sake, COVID kill kids. Children 18 (literally) greater chance struck lightning dying COVID.

Don't mess children bad risk assessment skills. far likely mess development prevent bad effect COVID. let people dine indoors dangerous! impact economy. Dining restaurant pandemic always high risk. also heard 7 10 adults UK considered roughly 70% Yea, hope finishing/bottling deal Sanofi smooths delivery hiccups we've seeing. 

Still, all-in-all, bad company 3-person startup back Obama president, top-tier juggernaut ending pandemic. overly cautious negative negative side effects

Can explain negative side effects wearing strongly feel message (as informed science) vaccinated, act pre-pandemic manner

Which started messaging. One main changes infographic include Visit fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks physical distancing

The problem is, crowds large groups, know vaccinated not. unvaccinated people would pretend vaccinated CDC guidelines changed ""Vaccinated people throw away masks need them"". Plus, US 29.1% population fully vaccinated. expect CDC say masks needed vaccinated people reach least 50% fully vaccinated. Possibly more, considering science says need ~70% immunity rates stop spread.  want vaccinated mom let far I‚Äôve understood, it‚Äôs even though you‚Äôre protected covid, still used transmission method people aren‚Äôt vaccinated. 

Example: Person person B unvaccinated aren‚Äôt wearing masks. Person exposed covid chance spreading it. Even though person person B never talk event, talk person A, talk person B, might transmit person B aren‚Äôt wearing mask. totally get feeling depressed responses, feel way. 

But honestly think gonna happen? Things stay currently forever? economy, human spirit general, can‚Äôt survive that. It‚Äôs completely unrealistic. Like not, world going return normal, like Spanish Flu. people delusional tbh. know social anxiety tough especially non social year. break though feel amazing. Covid, you‚Äôre safe you‚Äôre going get. Vaccinated decent ventilated area. You‚Äôre golden. Especially you‚Äôre 60 without serious medical conditions. likely die car crash wedding it. Also mothers socially distance said newborns. Use sterilized Nanny Robot feeding, think need ""socialize"" offspring, Zoom kid, they'll figure out. lived Sumner County worked Nashville. county north Nashville great job. infection fatality rate (IFR) proportion deaths among infected individuals 

So... want completely disregard fact COVID exceptionally contagious flu despite unprecedented action compare deaths relative number infections completely dismissing fact COVID literally killed people misinformation?

Am understanding position correctly? article linked: disruption healthcare services caused Covid-19 may led estimated 239,000 maternal child deaths South Asia, according new UN report.

How think healthcare services India right now? There‚Äôs going huge amount deaths, Covid non-Covid healthcare overwhelmed. wait call unclean shun 

I'm misquoting two months ago. Fauci basically saying unless impossible happens, stay lockdown. We're going right direction, best give us ""don't use mask outdoors..."" vaccinated 0 3  vaccine immunity booster. contractual guarantee  article actually extremely informative regards adenovirus vector vaccines created challenges manufactures overcome. looks like Brazilian regulators made right call, countries approved Sputnik vaccine asking tough questions Gamaleya, pressuring actually look Anvisa's concerns, rather calling findings ""fake news"". everyone followed recommendations pandemic would ended USA April 2020.  Good luck ..lolüëçü§û analogy, put mask first safe.

If pandemic ended global effort, chances vaccine resistant variant comes out.

Oh, nice. chart actually says going run outdoors without mask safe even unvaccinated people (if socially distance). Joe Biden‚Äôs speech seemed suggest unvaccinated people still needed wear masks doors even social distancing possible. sounded silly me.

Oregon Washington's combined seropositive rates roughly equivalent Deep South right now. Assuming 4X undercount rate, 43% infected e.g. Alabama whereas 17% infected Oregon. 

Two weeks ago (so accounting delay efficacy), Oregon's first dose percent 36%. Assuming equal spread, (.36)+(.64)(.17) = 47% antibodies. Alabama, 28%, (.28)+(.72)(.43) = 59% seropositive. else equal, would expect Oregon's Rt higher Alabama's point.

This ignores load factors (my guess previously infected less likely get vaccinated, guess undercount rate Alabama materially higher Oregon/Washington). EU actually passing US daily shots administered still rising. Still way peak US vaccine drive ~2 weeks ago though, lower number / capita. say announce something tonight?  statistical purposes, considered religion make easier compare everything else. fact remains [atheists generally lowest fertility society progresses, effect going exacerbated. religious people children, atheism would actually start shrink, kids grow religious tend stay religious. may leave, enough offset raw growth.

well yeah, that's expected considering CDC recommendation 2 weeks post NY cases gone 66% month. vaccines work 

The vaccines definitely work. 

But factors well, decline big mid-Jan mid Feb, many people vaccinated yet. cases doubled mid-march end March. 

It probably mix things, vaccines work prevent waves. One dose each? Interesting! Why, first dose identical second? thought different. Small boost short term effectiveness supposedly helps body retain immunity much longer time.  think government lockdowns took year you. vaccine months. ICU beds seems bit scary Yep. Peer-review consensus also fundamental components good science. still wear mine drive thrus area require so. Joe ""ape brain"" Rogan back again. 

Can't stick telling people eat days time whatever? I'm sorry hear this. I'm boat chemotherapy. yet vaccinated, continue wearing mask, maintaining distance, washing hands long time. true, see keep people New York anywhere else vaccines living life again. I'd take advice spinning side kick. I'm arguing get COVID instead getting vaccinated. would ridiculous. long-term symptoms, might help. already infected fully recovered, ship sailed (according study) already immunity comparable vaccinated. people cannot afford stay isolated home without government enforcement, every country actually took seriously understood that.

Furthermore, still need essential workers perform essential jobs like medical field, garbage collection, grocery retail on, people fields magically exempt getting COVID. That's need testing contact tracing make sure virus spreading unawares there's need second serious lockdown. Lockdowns serious consequences, meant long-term solutions.

This exactly NZ Singapore never needed long-term lockdowns US many EU countries failed mitigation efforts plan. countries like Iceland Taiwan even able rely strictly quarantining, contact tracing, testing without using lockdowns all. 

When actually look successful COVID mitigation, easy see contact tracing, testing, isolating/quarantining much important lockdowns alone. Generally impulse punch old men ever. tend think even desire cause physical harm someone frail like elderly person child makes less-than-great person real, casual 20 degree jump yesterday today LA whole. Fingers crossed May gray June gloom year. believe statistic several weeks old point, would also bit lagging indicator anyway. Also, specifically people getting full course vaccination contract Covid full two weeks reach full immunity. words, best case scenario likelihood catching followed everything correctly. Someone testing positive days second shot would've contacted first second dose full immunity achieved therefore included. sad people saw coming. He's current UFC commentator makes difference you. guys seen Sputnik V's twitter posts? tweets look like propaganda lol Joe Rogan gaping asshole depth. rates vaccinated people... dont see point. see mine? went winery New York months ago, stand buy small bag chips could purchase glass wine. Probably dumbest COVID rule I‚Äôve come across, felt like living alternate reality made absolutely sense something mandated highest level government state. likely both. know certain people, like blood cancer patients, trouble making antibodies vaccination. Presumably likely suffer breakthrough infections exposed. research trials immunocompromised people them, people got breakthrough infections anyways. far know, pattern seemed random - reports vaccine volunteers breakthrough infections correlated risk factors like age occupation, likely dice roll, unlike people get infected without vaccination. 

The kind people volunteer vaccine research trials likely follow scientific guidelines average population, ran trials kind people partied mask-less every weekend, ratio breakthrough infections might different. think says thinking, even idiotic. new CDC guidelines specify small group fully vaccinated individuals unmask indoors, obviously best thing keep safety measures place. two doses first time get one, one subsequent time. idea buy new one? Mine got confiscated last time out. Literally idea believe moment, read. true not.

The scientific data... getting virus full vaccine means 99% efficacy, still 1 100 chance. Obviously get vaccinated, less chance 1 100 event. funny part really serious burden imposed wearing mask abundance caution never been. It‚Äôs child abuse it‚Äôs anti-science.

The respect part ‚ÄúI understand deadly virus continues spread may family vulnerable. Even though it‚Äôs unlikely spread you, I‚Äôll err safe side small thing way inconveniences me.‚Äù Whats current baseline infection rate? will!

Also, 60s felt sick 3 days total vaccine likely made trivial illness her. also fortunately works wearing two masks face shield right patients safe possible. article does. Since March last year I've fortunate enough able work home. introvert dream come true.

Unfortunately mandatory work meeting coming suspect it'll discuss returning work. know tough answer anything say prolong working home?

I genuinely anxious return, due fact many people still unvaccinated. I'm anxious anyway compounds feel. I've lost sleep literally thinking returning office. 70% right YES. Antivaxxers US extremely loud they're small minority. lot European countries, people silently refuse get vaccinated much larger problem US. Herd immunity threshold lowest 60% highest around 80%, anti vaxxers irrelevant, big thing lot children aren‚Äôt old enough(16+) get vaccines, imagine drives numbers vaccination %, actuallity probably around 50% immune(considering it, vaccinated, small children) hope 7 months, understand longest really track, right?  Distancing barely anything indoors mask. go restaurants vaxxed. don‚Äôt think anyone likes needles, article talking small subsection population extreme fear needles. ever extreme phobia, know would literally rather die engage activity. think 10% cited article rather high, 2-3% would still impact reaching herd immunity. Phobias stigma people afraid admit them, especially men, many people might giving anti-vax excuses might issue. there's point getting vaccinated? Also pontoon boats?!?

(there early infographic randomly called months ago lol) Wouldn‚Äôt easier say ‚Äústill continue wearing mask indoors activity‚Äù? Lol Arent giant chunks anti vaxxers areas? Wonder theres correlation.... point stop wearing masks? Obviously, substantial portion population choose get vaccine. seems like everyone wants opportunity get it, restrictions go away. continue monitor water treatment virus fragments vaccines stops working I‚Äôll fucking mad lol vaccine made god damn sick, possibly painful soreness I‚Äôve ever bones entire life. really wanna go shit ever again. That's society works. plan interact members society, please option especially impact lives people. sad fact lost millions people pandemic. wearing masks end time‚Ä¶

I cannot disagree ‚Äúvaccinate enough people it, eventually life change‚Äù reasoning enough.

I Covid. fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm safe around now, never be. world revolve around Chicago. I‚Äôm sure can‚Äôt get lives still wearing masks? resistance new normal least get majority pop vaxxed? J&amp;J jab costs 300% AZ one, makes huge difference poorer nations.

Novavax kept -20 freezer level costs 5 times much AZ per jab.

All excellent vaccines though, better suits different economies, nations etc others That's unbelievably frustrating. would argue time goes on, likely catch contagious severe variant Covid. Getting vaccinated gets protection current prevalent strains future ones importantly, protect around her. Ugh... selfish.  
  
 really wish people would equate Covid safety protocols (i.e. wearing masks, social distancing, getting vaccinated) public health standard... example: employees required wash hands handling food. let dentist use unclean tools work teeth surgeon operate without gloves... Sam‚Äôs folks took advice trumpy  horrible analogy.  don‚Äôt quite understand you‚Äôre implying. 

The original commentor wants vaccinate child, can‚Äôt don‚Äôt administer vaccines normal children 15 below, they‚Äôll keep wearing masks. live Germany and, fact need get booster every 12-18 months, I'm concerned. already difficult get flu shot (you need actual doctors appointment), universally covered health insurance, majority people bother. Oh yeah last year ran out. wonder government planning huge supply issues every round COVID booster allowing insurance companies get paying it. God, big bird haunts fucking nightmares people. Yup. People always look ways shortcut safety protocols. Give even slightest indicator type thing, they'll get extra careless reckless. That's nice explanation. crib it. masks? going for-fucking-ever ü§¨ That's get DnD company time email sent round.  u/riahgor23 argue that. making point related earlier thread, *is* difference vaccinated careful vs. vaccinated careful.

And say already vaccinated, tell there's issue then. 60 million lot booster jabs. 


I imagine 30 million used JCVI groups 1-9 remaining 30 million first doses children. ""important conclusion"" taken middle abstract. Read paper see support argument. me, others pointed thing you. darkest timeline  Concerning af citizens Modi think it‚Äôs cool anti-UN, even means people die covid. Thats kinda bad example like 

""Why would get drivers license isint benefit get one."" keep seeing things like feel worse country inferior vaccine 50% effectivity.

Meanwhile, US piles AstraZeneca butts. don‚Äôt disagree you, I‚Äôm curious EU expect doses come from; context: AstraZeneca reduced commitment 180M 90M 70M. 

The last two weeks, reduced already low deliveries 90% confirmation when/if deliver missing doses.

I agree EU countries could use existing stock better, Netherlands live completely stop vaccination certain groups simply supply. even go J J basically one shot Novovax two shots storage requirements without blood clots also can't look selfish manner.  sooner WORLD covid free better are. People seem think ""close doors safe!"" propensity thing mutate proliferation high density impoverished nations could kill us stop thinking terms country even continent like EU here.

I‚Äôm young, healthy fully vaccinated, therefore afford take risks. point this? profiting changing guidelines? could‚Äôve left ‚Äúwear mask you‚Äôre outdoors, especially you‚Äôre indoors‚Äù that‚Äôs it.


There‚Äôs way knowing isn‚Äôt vaccinated, isn‚Äôt wearing mask b/c wild belief masks bad you, etc. I‚Äôm gonna trust people even less see unmasked. mean main thing get sick possibly die deadly pandemic disease, refuse get vaccine still wear masks airplanes guess that's call. think reach herd immunity vaccine, exactly? understanding certain number people immune, case rate begins decline lower standard. means, quicker get doses arms, quicker herd immunity, open more. What's confusing people also wanting done restrictions? argue bullshit medical voodoo day, believe vaccine works, want help get herd immunity faster? asocial actually like lockdowns something? someone's judgement shit seriously tell millions listeners get vaccine pandemic, want life goals advice either, frankly. insulting you? merely pointing holes argument. continue submit low quality paper still support argument. read paper beyond abstract? 

You fail grasp basic fact India cannot adopt model Australia, New Zealand south Asian countries thailand Vietnam mainly shut border. can't shut barn door horse already bolted. Long national lockdown followed mass vaccination way india. Anything else fool's dream. rates require funeral pyres thing.

Funeral pyres always ""been thing"" India. That's dispose dead.  them. busy now. crematories articles places build lot's pyres.

I assume indirectly put money via contract AstraZeneca, UK investment would significantly predate that. He‚Äôs legend Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Yea, anti-democratic hallmark ""pretty close opposite"" authoritarian. absolute double speak.  immediate goal individual governments. government exists interests citizens first. help globally, expense citizens things true, also boring podcast.  Joe Rogan terrible commenting UFC, much watch favourite sport mute. source this?  vaccines reduce risk becoming infected 85-95%. 5-15% get infected, tend fourfold lower viral load unvaccinated also clear virus quickly (i.e. they‚Äôre contagious fewer days). factors make vaccinated infected individual far less likely unvaccinated infected individual transmit virus someone else. Sure may saying ""Who would listen Joe Rogan?""...

Well, based channel stats youtube alone, gets 53 million views per month, Spotify's #1 podcast, gets 190 million listens every single month Spotify...

While biggest demographic demographic least likely already get vaccinated(18-25-year-olds).

This really bad thing, influence younger people immense. would that? matter never gig life. pointless loss jobs always bad thing. Green across board fully vaccinated people think followed Elon deep end. raging narcissists. People ask listen refuse listen Rogan - why. He's dipshit meathead pretends know things actually knows nothing adds absolutely zero value society.

Telling people get vaccine enough good person decide longer give views. I've always judged listeners negatively, brought whole new level. Yeah *plenty* shit Joe Rogan for.

Uhh... can't! 10x infected, means every single American got COVID (330m)! That's patently true. US would achieved herd immunity without needing vaccinate.

Great message guys

How surprised many don‚Äôt bother beyond Good luck, let us know things go anti bodies wear off. lunatics still claiming isn‚Äôt bad India. sure comfy houses England. Don‚Äôt antimasker got vaccinated. Wearing mask going store taking airplane flight another couple months REALLY isn‚Äôt difficult. helped fund plants EU there's export ban doses there. AZ also under-delivering UK, maybe sue get doses made EU? 

A contract made keep initial supply UK, which, quite frankly, fair enough considering UK taxpayers helped fund development vaccine sold cost help poorer countries. good, could better robust supply.

But generally yes, think given supply constraints Quebec's rollout gone well one could hope. There's lot stretching going here, especially regards word ""authoritarian"".

If going define ""any country whose leader cultivates tough guy image disrespects traditional democratic norms"", suppose could argue Bolsonaro Trump fit bill. reality actually governed countries completely different. LARPing, laissez-faire lib…ôrtarians terms policy (not regards virus, general). authoritarians; they're pretty close opposite.

Of course, ignores wider issue, global vaccine supply extremely limited. two biggest economies world, one invoking laws prevent export relevant supplies, can't even 5 million day (US daily average 2.8), chance Brazil stand 10?  IMO sociology play part telling people safe not. caused distrust whole CDC first place. told everyone masks help people hoard masks flipped script later on. point I'm surprised anyone listens CDC can't tell saying based science they're saying control masses. import xiomi phones figure? say someone visited Greece, Italy, Spain Croatia. Calm down, us vaxxing like 3 million people day take medical advice Joe Rogan, you‚Äôre probably already moron. Fauci‚Äôs words might fall deaf ears. Would doctor able prescribe second dose? Yep.

Many people ""believe"" safe fully vaccinated, also know minority people around fully vaccinated well. Since wearing Vaccination Badges can't tell who, given number anti-vaxx, anti-mask COVIDiots making unsafe decisions - harm following safer-for-the-unvaccinated practices couple months get majority eligible people protected?

It still actual anti-vaxxers causing problem - people excessively cautious anti's can't trusted act public good.  took antibody test 2.5 months tested positive tested negative antibodies Wrong analogy.

CDC says go wear mask. care? I'll wearing mask every flu season on. calculations assume r0 static, experiences far suggest virus seasonal extent (at least temperate climates).

I'd wager 60% immunity enough summer. That‚Äôs we‚Äôve seen wild. Real world data showing vaccine far effective. December last time looked data? true. yeah, also see keeping recommendation long time. feel like putting words mouth simultaneously supporting point. vaccine trials not, way, explore differential precautions groups -- rely singular number support cool vaccinated folks go freely maskless.

They've open Arlington, TX month now. surge cases hospitalization continued go down. what's exit criteria then? masks chucked fire? high sports pandemic? fully vaccinated go indoor gatherings stores etc without masks? equivalent saying abstinence way avoid STD. Sure, correct, (non ace) people would argue sex integral part humanity worth level risk. Society lost tolerance ability assess risk completely last year. Ya u explain vietnam china small fraction Covid cases kids 16 result hospitalization, even less deaths.

At point anyone wants vaccine get it. friends family gotten doesn‚Äôt take much effort find appointment. can‚Äôt burden society individuals unwilling get vaccine. certain point transfer risk onto individual.

Covid dangerous kids can‚Äôt continue hold back normalcy get vaccinated. lot hesitancy fully vaccinated parents get kids it‚Äôs something reasonably expect happen soon anyways. Kids going get vast majority cases going fine. don‚Äôt pause society flu goes around worse young children. think another one still going Fully vaccinated maskless... thats people getting it, messaging wrong since beginning. think want people keep what‚Äôs safest safer since population isn‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet Fair enough live area people responsible. live area science bad word masks ""oppression"" I‚Äôm one asking, high school sports pandemic? ‚ÄúWe people driving two three hours try come get vaccine believe access larger market small market,‚Äù said Pam Marquess, owner Woodstock Health Mart Pharmacy.


Is referring to? saying people drive far. They're choosing think better chance getting vaccine bigger city compared small town pharmacy.

No doubt harder get vaccinated town without pharmacy, point surplus vaccines. want vaccine pretty much get one point.

I live 10 minutes GA state line incredibly easy get vaccine appointment now. Terrorists - threats
Virus - Im getting sick


Ya can't fix stupidity kind silly, gone way fully vaccinated people removed pandemic restrictions. I'm arguing, ""numbers game"" hang unvaccinated family? still large number unvaccinated people, knows they've last two weeks. giant chunks anti vaxxers live south noted particular flu virus also caused high rate GBS. vaccine really issue, actual virus.

Its argument make better vaccines avoiding epitopes cause cross reactive antibodies, technology now. what‚Äôs point getting vaccine still wear mask? blocked ages ago see anymore. hear bullshit mutual family members still see social posts / talk family phone / etc. IP definitely causing supply issues. talk several articles demonstrating US specifically gave powers numerous times 80s ""march in"" IP.  K Thanks. knew stupid question Children 16 can't get vaccinated yet. That‚Äôs goal whole time. Everyone needs open eyes number people straight furious grip others loosening. It‚Äôs disturbing. It‚Äôs like people get exerting control others. Ok... well... let's take flu deaths age group since 2010... 20,784... compare number provided slightly year COVID... 23,862.

COVID deaths age group year taken extraordinary measures minimize still flu nearly 10 years combined almost nothing. 

Im sure got lot ground stand saying post disingenuous...  makes sense... wearing masks supposed prevent people getting sick... left side showing unvaccinated people masking around vaccinated people way around. makes sense unvaccinated wearing n95 masks...   hospital overloaded right mean future agree become political flag - symbol one team other.

My point that, practical point view, ""when take thing off"" choice choose quit wearing versus CDC changing rules. fully expect keep recommending masking long time. Yes, vials warmed room temperature 6 hours injecting. Yes- variants several mutations, impression number double triple related significant mutations conferred advantage. fair, think kinda trying lmao. It‚Äôs really hard challenge someone BSing wildly Jones seems like good way get shots younger people.
 
And good way get vaccinated India need social distance least two metres apart, also stop traditional water touch water contain virus fragments treat high standard water treatment facility good would including do? like two extremely niche scenarios vaccinated people wear mask otherwise according graphic. Talk touch... need motivating people get vaccinated, telling they‚Äôll still wear masks everywhere.  seems like generally goes.

No, take absolutely wrong. lack intervention whatsoever would almost certainly caused collapse healthcare infrastructure. Take look India, infection rates control they're running basic supplies.

Basically, hit 100% emergency room capacity hospitals, things get *very* bad, everyone. reason every single epidemiologist world argued strongly idea nothing reasonable plan.  funny getting downvoted right. go podcast expecting receive solid advice factual helps take medical decisions try shit giving you, I'm sure he's one wrong. He, like people, going say shit thinks makes sense. People need temper expectations. Every sentence brand new sentence, make important unique worthy sub. know tell u got flu vaccine before...like think, use brain, Based I'm reading CDC, risk getting ""breakthrough"" infection around many unvaccinated people. numbers game, unvaccinated people around, greater potential. risk probably great based numbers, comes personal risk tolerance. 

The CDC agencies continue recommend interactions enough general population vaccinated. Here's list PROVEN reinfections. proven sequencing two infections, using genetic differences prove true reinfection, rather remnants first see, indeed less severity first infection. decent amount worse second time, including deaths. 

There could sorts different reasons worse second time. example, immune system might ramp much destroy organs. person's health could changed meantime (one deaths someone started chemotherapy two infections). even things like initial viral dose received bigger second time. stopped since I'm vaccinated now. Please explain playing psychological games hypothetical sociological data ‚Äúthe science‚Äù? great news celebrate that's India Mr. Covid took personally. past year time country state patted back, Mr. C made pay it. Hopefully time different. agree err side caution, say whether it'll year several years, think happen eventually. get shots stay top boosters, thing worse cold mild flu going forward. unvaccinated going much higher risk, them. depends community spread. there's strain flu going around neighborhood/city - yeah sure mask public 100% time. Otherwise? really necessary. want to, power you, necessary. 31 wrinkle sight insane chest wrinkles

........ gone outside recently? Everywhere go see people wearing masks they're outdoor themselves. asinine  Imo last 3-4 months new variants require vaccine boosters. 

COVID stay. Immunity depends population large views vaccines. can't speak EU, look good places like southern portion US, even north west.

You're talking shite sources mate. Tbf North Tulsa run part all. work southern side much better many many coworkers (old, young, male, female, white, Hispanic) gotten shots. were! Almost half refused. Wait total case count drop small amount, theoretically happen enough people get vaccinated virus can‚Äôt spread much. 

Right 10 people carrier meet, 5 vaccinated/has antibodies 5 might easily contract it. Hopefully enough vaccinations get point virus dies able find new host infect live through.

Fuck vaccine! That's literally entire point public health. disagree you, CDC operating ""what need say people manipulate X numbers decrease metrics"". love baseball.

I've vaccinated work medicine, partner vaccinated educator. caring people Yeah, bit day two second shot too. Nothing bad. ""brain fog"" worst side effect, that's pretty good. wanting kill parents? sister works retail. parents clinically vulnerable. Separate bathrooms, eating together, etc. spending time room - opposite sides wears mask.

 


You lot act wearing mask piece piss. breath masks on, think can‚Äôt head far ass hear us telling that. Novavax even approved yet. equally possible rare side-effect picked trials. also significantly expensive AZ jab.

And J&amp;J seems similar issues blood clotting. also expensive too.   Don‚Äôt wear condoms would wear mask  point people 16 low risk Covid. Less 2% Covid related hospitalizations people age 16.

If 16 zero issue getting vaccine.

Nobody denying seriousness Covid thread. made serious threat posed elderly aged groups mostly vaccinated. stated goal beginning keep hospital systems overwhelmed. cannot overwhelmed Covid high vaccine rates people 50. almost like one flaw/opinon define human. He's obviously successful, dedicated human, great career, healthy lifestyle. He's black belt ju jistu, hunts cooks meat, Runs one successful podcasts, commentates ufc, stand up, more. think life advice could help ignorant. Yeah seemed know little prodding brain. wonder CDC kind QnA forum support chat something ask questions stuff. would much easier alot us. number fully vaccinated people breakthrough cases COVID much smaller 2-5%. last week, fewer 6000 cases America 

We obviously don‚Äôt know extent vaccinated people spread it, vast majority aren‚Äôt catching COVID begin sorry. misread that.  already booked flights hotels late summer even though I'm vaccinated yet, LETS FUCKING GO Bruh, live 3 guys, one manages coffee shop. I'm currently one fully vaccinated house.

On Monday one workers came shop worked roommate. coworker notified got work positive test covid.

Now whole shop shut none people work (early mid 20s) gotten even first shot. state vaccines available age group month.

It's nice seeing millions getting shots daily feels like we'll never end thing literally nobody circle except getting vaccinated. Herd immunity know state borders. Vaccines also created ""non-wealthy nations"" like India  Oops right! sorry. read sentence twice still misread it. Still brain fog vaccine. apologies.  dumb. There's plenty evidence show vaccinated individuals infect others. latest data literally top story BBC right shows vaccines reduce likelihood spreading covid 50%. Great, still shit odds. bunch people never watched listened Joe Rogan complaining Joe Rogan said. mean, yeah Trump really fucked response, pandemic coming regardless probably boosters years even best response global pandemic.

Why man still living rent free head anyways? kind thing guess common sense way, Sinopharm's vaccine yet approved Brazil. Gyfs definitely questionable study, like Manaus one. OTOH, India significant, symmetrical peak last summer: virus seemed go away large extent infections stayed low despite lack significant social distancing; could result high levels population immunity.

India's situation incredibly weird hard make sense what's going there. reason cherry-picking one vaccine? Yes course. Hilarious. EU factories already fulfilled UK's Pfizer/BioNTech order, accounting 40% overall vaccinations far. AZ delivered 1/10th total order. say Netherlands, ""stank voor dank"".  Considering vaccinated individuals get covid spread it, would need mask? trust science too, science emerging topic best incomplete. Science without error. abundance caution still better idea trusting incomplete data. say wear mask means immune virus, much less likely die it. still want catch COVID even extremely mild. Also bear mind vaccine distribution heavily skewed, whilst 7/10 adults might antibodies mean 7/10 adults pass street Wtf bullshit. unvaccinated people allowed large indoor event ones likely transmit COVID-19!? 

Because vaccine passports aren‚Äôt popular idea. instead get chart, essentially coddles anti-vax wearing mask peer pressure. arbitrary threshold created made ""emergency"". think Oregon Health Department knew accurate thresholds still get virus AIRBORNE continue enforce outdoor mask mandates? think first amendment protects free speech against? Even medical professional friends think shutdown silly. Portland Metro consists several counties included. metro counties also highest vaccination rates. Oh yea, schools still operating normal really true ""shutdown"".

The rural counties horrible vaccination rates surprised businesses counties tell state pound sand. Spotify announced podcast brought new subscribers initially expected no, won‚Äôt honest I‚Äôd rather get vaccine keep wearing mask. vary widely country though. like Ireland Nordics much better US, rife France Eastern Europe.  Mainly, cannot look past happens people even die covid infection. neighbours issue. alone, happening prior moving. He's vaccinated, need mask anywhere. 

Yes agree, completely virtue signalling point. Yep. I‚Äôm worried near future mask wearing theater protective. like taking shoes probably isn‚Äôt making air travel safer, regulations stay people want feel safe government ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù. So, fear government risk aversion coupled social signals mask wearing means indefinitely.

I hope I‚Äôm wrong, fact nobody really given serious target beyond vague ‚Äúwhen reach herd immunity someday‚Äù makes think aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Same... it‚Äôs sad. Imagine mouth piece season throwing stuff around fuck limited understanding (that‚Äôs way outside field expertise) could kill 1000 people.  [it pure  year, California recorded 1,379 cases coronavirus infection people fully vaccinated... recorded Jan. 1 April 21 ‚Äî make 0.1% roughly 1.4 million cases reported California period... Tuesday, 30% Californians received two shots...

Can't get apple apple comparison? numbers mean nothing.  wonder antibody level would affected breakthrough cases doubt case. AZ based let‚Äôs say Switzerland, bet EU would demand delivery well. truly understand UK point view, EU/EEA point view, treated well AstraZeneca. 

Here Netherlands, criticism AstraZeneca read nothing praise UK vaccine rollout press here. often even see AstraZeneca mentioned Swedish company rather UK one (which makes sort sense contract Swedish entity UK one)  normal Madison things

Public urination is!   I'm glad asked here's 2nd barrel. new data shows vaccine least 97% effective preventing symptomatic disease, severe COVID-19, hospitalizations, death two weeks second study also shows vaccine 94% effective stopping asymptomatic infections.

[
So math, .97 * .94 = 91.2% Transmission Yeah many cases really think originated vaccinated people outdoors? Like 100 most? many people hyper caution turn vaccinated? would think. 

The question unvaccinated people don‚Äôt want vaccinated comes lot r/askreddit one common responses vaccine pointless they‚Äôre young either doesn‚Äôt much prevent transmission (it according kinds studies would think reading guidance like this?) won‚Äôt give actually want (being allowed go normal lives).   equally freedom speech people point Joe Rogan's opinion dangerous dumb, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

10/10 weeks. making sense. I'm vaccinated. Covid shit me, I'm going live rest life behind mask people can't get vaccinated (I followed mask health mandates, cautiously possible). can't get vaccine, certain point safety problem, society's. get vaccinated, idgaf happens you.

dO pArT Here's another one ya new data shows vaccine least 97% effective preventing symptomatic disease, severe COVID-19, hospitalizations, death two weeks second dose. study also shows vaccine 94% effective stopping asymptomatic infections.

[So math, .97 * .94 = 91.2% Transmission understanding one region hit extremely hard initially, region got media coverage.

NO, ask anyone India amazing touch CDC point that, get infected significantly less chance developing sever symptoms, arguably important part vaccines people tend forget about. Thanks everyone responded. 
I talked things mentioned. 
The logic reason bring discussion gets defensive. can't help it. anti covid vaxxer. 

It also religion. Christian afraid die believes afterlife better. 

I hope survive this. lost cause. Chances getting robbed hacked lower that, still lock doors? bet do! they're going come away thinking vaccines pussies now.

You need smarter friends. Okay. I‚Äôm going trust science it. People much smarter told vaccine effective, continue wear mask people vaccinated - reasonable thing do. don‚Äôt know tipping point unreasonable, hope get years. agree somewhat moot point attack Joe (let without sin cast first stone all...), one *could* argue he/his podcast benefited situated California, thus benefited Californian infrastructure taxes. Moving low-tax state getting huge payday light could seen paying 'his fair share'.

Again, something I'd mad about, see bones argument there. Correct I'm wrong though. factually false. Oregon's hospitalization levels never dropped particularly near pre-pandemic levels, actually bit rising case counts outright threatened repeating falsehoods en mass make true. Take political brigade elsewhere. isn‚Äôt approved, couldn‚Äôt get though normal channels even desperately wanted it. really isn‚Äôt anything talk of.

The second approved, efficacy safety similar existing 16+ versions, I‚Äôd venture doctors would emphatically encourage getting it. Covaxin better suited deal mutations mRNA vaccines Adenovirus vaccines. Covaxin, like mentioned, inactivated vaccine. It‚Äôs dead virus. means exposes proteins virus immune system, helping develop antibodies antigens. mRNA adenovirus vaccines meanwhile express Spike protein nothing else. spike protein highest rates mutation. spike protein mutates significantly, Covaxin still okay produces antibodies proteins like N protein, mRNA/Ad vaccines suffer reduced efficacy. Haha I've thought it. Yeah, seems like they're hesitant since they've seen negative things re: vaccinations. They're necessarily opposed, cautious. Definitely going trying change right now. Go Botswana shipments, doses cover 1.1 million people come Johnson &amp; Johnson 250,000 Moderna Inc., Mosepele said televised briefing Monday. planned procurement, excludes earlier arrangements Covax initiative, subject changes implementation, according Mosepele. Since March, Botswana vaccinated 47,160 people donated doses got via Covax. Lets hope Canada boat! used really like used love podcasts. really interesting people nice bland mainstream interviewing, one else would talk snowden.

However now, tool, touch reality, covid, painful watch, dont! Yeah really like Joe Rogan, I‚Äôm gonna go fauci someone equal experience (which doubt there‚Äôs anybody) medical advice. God hope not. dont think could take politicizing sides covid again. Im worried next bacteria/virus. basically set stage time new disease happens cant control kills 0 people, shut world down. people feel way, listen him. simple. Nope, never did.   Getting rid restrictions say, 75% population fully vaccinated? Awesome. 

When 25% are? much.

I lived Tennessee several years still several friends there. news I'm happy see. children can't even get vaccinated yet.

Not long ago, saw people predicting would new ""stay home forever"" rallying cry, thought way anyone would buy it. Thankfully, seems like people buy it. I'd rather get sick vaccine, get covid. sucked, temporary. I'm glad degree concern. sure hell want repeat past year. Almost 19M people California least 1 dose, 11M fully vaccinated. 

So 1400/19 Million = 0.007% vaccinated people breakthrough case.

Vaccines work.  point public health everyone ignore public health agencies instead seek reputable advice. But, don‚Äôt agree point public health. Agreed. Freedom speech works ways. can't people agree, thats works.   Ahhh gotcha, actually aware that! question got second shot know advised.

Depending results I'll try get J&amp;J shots. Thanks insight :) response spelling ""role"" instead ""roll""...brilliant. received backlash said Friday episode podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" ""If you‚Äôre healthy person you‚Äôre exercising time you‚Äôre young you‚Äôre eating well, don‚Äôt think need worry \[getting vaccinated\]."" would want out? He‚Äôs always said outlandish stuff anyway Holy damn. I'm Canada plugged US rates. Damn. conspiracy theory nonsense friend. Bill Gates isn‚Äôt get you.

Note UN petitioners couldn‚Äôt give evidence IP waiver would increase production access vaccines. Add argument using compulsory licensing provided petitioners process takes long, reason starting immediately doesn‚Äôt seem priority even IP waiver approach rejected obviously take even longer. telling IMO. money vaccine access.

You asked people would downvote comments IP waiver proposals. think explained. Many people see knowledge/asset grab vested interests detrimental future collaboration vaccine production. lost lot respect Undertaker podcast like bashing professional wrestling years.

Yeah, go one. 2024? think 5 6 vaccine manufacturers forever? That's people say want held responsible things say. cop out. He's public figure significant influence knows it. Seriously, it‚Äôs time make purely transactional.

‚ÄúAs soon X percent people get vaccinated, go back normal. long takes folks.‚Äù  platform everything. was, vaccine would've approved long ago. bothered safety considerations, efficacy. course would ridiculous. 

It's good technology proven successful, mean vaccine identical safety profile. ""Some folks 'll never eat skunk, folks 'll."" (Israel) hit wall well 55%. Didn‚Äôt matter though probably enough known enough recovered people. fair, started host Fear Factor. LOL! ever taking Joe Rogan seriously. think people tend agree Joe Rogan tend listen him. People minds made covid vaccine. dont think listeners anti-vax him, listen ant-vax. He's talking intermittent fasting. Still wear mask even fully vaccinated, people might think us don‚Äôt.    Yeah people saying it‚Äôs behavior persuasion flat wrong. position masking required regardless makes sense scientifically proven leads apathy sense CDC ridiculous (which are).

I mean got vaccine could stop wearing masks. That‚Äôs care point fucking done nonsensical bullshit. also shortage tests initially early tests largely limited people displayed flu like symptoms many asymptomatic cases flew radar. Right we're likely catching far asymptomatic cases year ago today.  Yeah, tried DMT? I‚Äôm totally fine people wear masks everywhere I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôm wearing one don‚Äôt get mad leave alone matter everyone else already vaccinated?

It lasted less hour still... they're trying protests covid rules everywhere. would topic US CDC discussing anywhere outside US? Technically says ‚Äúsafest‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt every category mask would safest? It‚Äôs kinda scary many people seem cheering things remain closed/restricted long possible. even gives vaccinated incentive convince unvaccinated go well. listened anemic episodes sports figures actors last year. Helped pass time long road trip. Seems like void long-form interview notable people fills. Unfortunate says dumb shit.  You‚Äôre literally talking ass.

Unless missed public health press release had?  Huh? think much less nice say certain people beyond help. Hes saying isnt true, nicer optimistic, likely realistic. going complain anyone, let supreme court. They're ones ruled curfews constitutional. Wow demand really slowing ? nihilism? insulting you?

Yes, question credential ""Are sure PhD trained?"". highly offensive.

A proper scientist cherry pick data pointing 1 2 examples make conclusion looking systematic evidence check statistical significance. anecdotes sounding make conclusions data.

I think I'm done want waste time random immature individual.  Source that? I'd happily welcome this, I've seen leads believe still catch vaccines, chance death miniscule. Baseball awesome. MLB however full cheaters sucks fun game me.  cannot get joke unvaccinated people must wear masks 2 instances vaccinated. people know intentions getting shot wearing masks anywhere. 

My happy vaccinated self must continue wear mask almost situations. disconnect baffles me... attending sporting events vaccinated though. already worst case they'll contract covid spread since vaccines take two weeks effective.  There‚Äôs scary amount people CA think vaccinated 100 percent immune COVID-19. even question intelligence, question expertise. Even Rogan smartest man world, he's subject matter expert vaccines Covid 19 business giving public health suggestions. Dude needs stay lane, esp. pandemic. Again, trying divide number people vaccinated second vs number people confirmed cases. determine well vaccines working, compare case rates unvaccinated vaccinated populations. Yeah, IL waited 15 minute allergic reaction, directed station sign 2nd appointment there, person though, QR code.

I also briefly Walgreens appointment cancelled instead, registering first dose Walgreens website immediately schedules second dose well.

From I've seen elsewhere, sounds like problem getting scheduled second dose appointment, people showing second dose appointment scheduled. That‚Äôs exact logical fallacy thinking brain couldn‚Äôt think name! Thank you. COVID shit you? Wow idea vaccines 100% effective COVID. I've heard 95%+ effective serious illness. vaccines take gives 100% immunity? still catch COVID likely mild case. Let's hope sake there's long term side effects Covid infection. could wear mask little longer prevent virus entering body all. Funny everyone defiantly stop wearing mask, one claiming they'll stop washing hands *US* Centers Disease Control. Lol angry comments tell truth expecting much higher efficacy preventing hospitalizations one dose. course expected elderly require higher doses achieve sufficient immune response assuming everyone around vaccinated, way knowing. Public resistance vaccine strong mostly due anti-vax misinformation that's rampant everywhere (including Reddit).

Ignoring effectiveness vaccines called science-denier. that. Right. think tells us 1 1000 known infections period found vaccinated people. doesn‚Äôt tell us likely vaccinated people become infected sick.

Face coverings rides also reduced recommendation rather requirement.

This seems reasonable? Hey all, thanks AMA! fully vaccinated recognize vaccines light end tunnel pandemic, however, advice would give friends family members strongly getting vaccine? people dissing Joe, I‚Äôm biggest fan maybe actually listen said jumping band wagon hating someone someone else‚Äôs said dislike. Joe also admits he‚Äôs fucking moron, experts come give insightful information fields studies. want hear people like Brian Greene Dr.Swan get information there, it‚Äôs great podcast. choosing wear mask, despite vaccinated, shows give shit others. want make sick. Fuck Joe Rogan. issue isn‚Äôt difficulty necessity. bet share opinion that. Saying much bolder claim. 100% this. likely expect tons people stop wearing masks outdoors even unvaccinated. reality data shows pretty damn safe (even unvaccinated). 

So trying open restrictions still also considering people breaking rules. 

If vaccinated everyone else vaccinated, say indoor restaurant - negligible risk. know say no-masks indoors vaccinated people ton people start breaking rules actually major risk spread. 

We need keep working vaccinated start opening (and community spread numbers lower). given real thing. Tested negative antibodies positive after. drive car piss people like Rogan. Like really hurts fefees much ? vaccinated people wearing mask fucks up? throw tv, achieve sex/food/tv trifecta! Yep, sorry. Meant say ""aren't"". Sick clip CVS bunch northeast. Try them. Joe Rogan incorrect things. actual point trolls like you? Like really think shilling going change reality? piss people off? Like end game nonsense? That'd great unvaccinated people could stop irresponsible spreading variants vaccinated people much less protection given real thing placebo? isn't. asymptomatic spread debunked without vaccine. I'm vaccinated I'll ditching mask. Bill good telling stories too. great!

WHY GOING INDIANPOLIS, BILL? Yup. one point vaccines starting roll out, people like ""just wait months vulnerable vaccinated, open things up!"" months later, morphed ""just wait 6 months children!"" like many predicted. No. That's saying all.

Hope clears things ya.  daughter (17) dealing severe depression recently, first time life. concerned vaccine may make things worse her.

Are known side effects vaccines may cause depression worsen existing depression? Thank you. many COVID, many exposed people, many contracted it, many presented symptoms.

Basically, we‚Äôre trying prove negative: someone fully vaccinated active COVID infection can‚Äôt spread virus. can‚Äôt ‚Äì infer absence opposite: vaccinated person *can* spread virus.

Then there‚Äôs question many 6000 breakthrough cases immune response, ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù mean ‚Äúgot shots‚Äù. It‚Äôs common, doctor patients get antibody tests 2-3 weeks second dose, several patients (all treated cancer detectable HIV/AIDS) immune reaction.

Because depending data analyzed, people immune response may lumped did, thus producing cases ‚Äúsomeone received doses vaccine contracting spreading COVID‚Äù, would boil to, ‚ÄúAha, vaccine stop spread 96.3% population!‚Äù, that‚Äôs true (in hypothetical situation number correct), leaves 3.7% still spread lack immune response.

Anyways, point **we don‚Äôt know**, safest (and best) assumption **if virus reproducing system, spread it**.

And people stop fucking saying ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt even know spread active infection vaccine!‚Äù, though it‚Äôs magical remedy that, oops, still lets virus reproduce system *won‚Äôt* let cough, spit, sneeze, etc. infect people.

They‚Äôre antibodies, midi-chlorians. fall/winter boosters trial would expect distribution?

And best estimate minor eligibility? What‚Äôs latest data Pfizer efficacy first dose regular covid variants? feel way Canada. article cited said 0.4% clinical trials, 40 times number pulled ass. going go logic start talking fallacies, least use accurate numbers instead straw men make point seen valid. Also, shouting ""false equivalency"" meaningless, might well ""caveat emptor"" phrase.

I compared seatbelts safety measures wearing mask, part overall strategy safety involving multiple elements. keep saying things like ""If seatbelt vaccine..."" even said. Again, straw man, arguing something different point make easy knock instead actually refuting argument.

But, waste time. care risk, around you. 40% Americans (where am) received least one dose, 1 4 fully vaccinated according Johns Hopkins. might end dead hospital, could potentially spread could. large majority people vaccinated, precautions still necessary.

Plus, bringing boogeyman deleterious effects wearing masks, almost real scientific support except minor skin issues case people medical settings they're frequently double masking wearing lot protective gear apply vast majority general public. think that's legitimate concern need start demasking 1/4 population even vaccinated (and that's US, worldwide), I've got hydroxychloroquine sell you. anyone know find J&amp;J vaccine specifically? Looking LA/SoCal area. trial, need proof vaccine university, proof trial won‚Äôt come it‚Äôs late. people recognize shocks me. incredibly inept messaging, policy making, psychology...the list goes on.

The dangerous part blue governors live die directives association, fucks sane citizens living states. disagree - TN nice place vacation. current numbers suggest 99.99835% efficacy. (Cases vaccinated people / vaccinated population)

And 99.96% efficacy unvaccinated people using suspect math? Exactly. people keep saying pandemic never end cannot reach herd immunity, missing point entirely. 

We need eradicate covid, need tame it. 1379 infections seen fully vaccinated people.

The real number bound lot higher since asymptomatic mild infections probably reported. 

The report say anything mild severe infections were. guy's patience Still, Pfizer shown successfully neutralize several variants including P1 B135. Citation, Common Sense. never said I'd stop wearing mask awhile longer. I'll wear one long recommended. asked state position original comment makes sound like advocate wearing masks FOREVER since likened wearing seatbelt. I'm wearing awhile longer they're longer needed. argument I'm making point, we're going ditch masks society wearing indoors rest lives farcical. Y'all distinctly different place NC, terms overall vaccination/vulnerability virus, makes sense different rules. 

NC 40% population 18 fully vaccinated, 70% population 65 fully vaccinated. 38.5% overall population NC least one shot, 30% doses.

Canada (overall, sure province located in) 25% population one dose, 2.3% population doses.

Plus like someone travel NC Canada anyway, I'm sure worried about.   Looks like data collected 14 days 1st dose. Surprising study says data limitation weren‚Äôt many hospitalizations trial participants I‚Äôd hope real world number actually higher.  Anyways, point don‚Äôt know, safest (and best) assumption virus reproducing system, spread people stop fucking saying ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt even know spread active infection vaccine!‚Äù, though it‚Äôs magical remedy that, oops, still lets virus reproduce system won‚Äôt let cough, spit, sneeze, etc. infect people.

The thing is, plenty experts already said vaccines likely reduce transmission. there's data back up. need data tell people certainty. yeah, safer assume vaccinated people transmit virus. mean transmit degree warrants significant concern. 

From [The messaging public conversation around transmission risks vaccinated people. is, course, important alert considerations: Many vaccines ‚Äúleaky‚Äù prevent disease severe disease, infection transmission. fact, completely blocking infection‚Äîwhat‚Äôs often called ‚Äústerilizing immunity‚Äù‚Äîis difficult goal, something even many highly effective vaccines don‚Äôt attain, doesn‚Äôt stop extremely Paul Sax, infectious-disease doctor Boston‚Äôs Brigham &amp; Women‚Äôs Hospital, put early December, would enormously surprising ‚Äúif highly effective vaccines didn‚Äôt also make people less likely transmit.‚Äù multiple studies, already knew asymptomatic individuals‚Äîthose never developed COVID-19 despite infected‚Äîwere much less likely transmit virus. vaccine trials reporting 95 percent reductions form symptomatic disease. December, learned Moderna swabbed portion trial participants detect asymptomatic, silent infections, found almost two-thirds reduction even cases. good news kept pouring in. Multiple studies found that, even cases breakthrough disease occurred vaccinated people, viral loads lower‚Äîwhich correlates lower rates transmission. Data vaccinated populations confirmed many experts expected along: course vaccines reduce yet, beginning, good chunk public-facing messaging news articles implied claimed vaccines won‚Äôt protect infecting people didn‚Äôt know would, false. found trying convince people social network vaccines weren‚Äôt useless transmission, bombarded social media claims were.

[From positivity actually step recent news. research Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines also indicates retain strong effectiveness variants like London strain. folks scientific community reluctant say data comes in, there's long reason believe vaccines make significant dent transmission virus. implications huge: getting vaccinated stop getting severe COVID, limits much spreads, widespread vaccination truly allow us get back something approaching normal lives. early data Israel, led way getting shots arms, extremely promising: Pfizer shot 98.8 percent effective preventing deaths hospitalizations, stopped 89.4 percent transmission. pans larger data samples, respect two formulas, vaccines nothing less miracle. would mean likely nearing end.

I New York Times link saying similar things share well. mentioned factors researchers consider, really relevant. Researchers know use control groups make conclusions stuff, that's they're paid do. eventually say, certainty, vaccines reduce transmission. Someone say something past, present, might agree mean automatically start hating them.

Just agree views, mean can't enjoy parts work. Yeah, became ‚Äúexpert‚Äù stopped listening actual experts shut shit off. Nothing worse rich cry baby covid us hospital actually dealing reality it, rich mansion insulated version it.  I'm baiting you.

I'm calling bullshit calculation ""efficacy.""

That's calculate efficacy. take number cases divide number people vaccinated. need compare placebo/control group.

And want calculate garbage way, going people right behind talking ""effective"" vaccinated virus.

And guess what? 99.99835% number going drop time. every day we're going get breakthrough cases. might go bit still quickly vaccinating people, point number start dropping we'll stop getting appreciable increases vaccinated people, still getting breakthrough cases.

So, yeah, let's use word efficacy used, bullshit way used it. People take medical advice celebrities ~~like Joe Rogan Suzanne Somers~~ beyond help.

FIFY Fauci channeling Heisenberg: ""It's *I say* over."" What‚Äôs point vaccine still wear mask lol bit badly phrased simplified antibodies fade immunity lost t-cells abundant enough (e.g. older populations). 

The whole point show measurable antibodies likely well protected. discussion well protected antibodies fade different one basically wear masks indefinitely eh? Covid never really going away. Oh sure, especially given naivety age audience. Im opposed podcasts giving Alex Jones platform challenge claims. That's Bill Burr awesome Joe Rogan.  beyond this, also posted tweets safety record vaccine others Hungary, specifically claiming Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ‚Äú32x death rate‚Äù ‚Äú6x infection rate‚Äù follows tweet claiming data across several international health sources shows higher death rate administration Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine well.

As sad is, really surprising. Negative reporting Chinese Russian vaccines Western media quickly responded slander campaign Western vaccines Chinese Russian media. JnJ AZ came pressure blood clots, immediately press reports alleged problems mRNA vaccines. 

Unsurprisingly, first victim vaccine propaganda war truth. He's always tons comedians on. ok bash act like something new honest. Hell thats podcast started...just buddies talking shit couch. remember year ago CDC masks. wonder changed. Afaik sponsorship anymore. ads rare times listened guest. Maybe premium Bill Burr calls everyone bullshit, including himself, goddamn refreshing. 32. thought young still :( whole point wore masks give immunologists enough time prepare vaccine. whole point get Vaccinated. based understanding scenario mentioned Dr. Fauci previously said fully vaccinated ppl meet indoors unmasked restrictions. masking guidance chart indoor party vaccinated un-vaccinated ppl. understand efficacy numbers work, apparently neither people upvoting you. right natural immunity help get 70% number, there's good way track ""true"" number there. 

But, think we'll get pretty close pretty soon, already 43% Americans least one dose open 16+ 9 days. percentage higher want look adults.

Demand still going outstripping supply anymore. J&amp;J re-opening help reach mobility issues get vaccine sites, far flung rural areas. think highly unlikely catch covid +70mph rollercoaster. lot trouble finding information supporting use cloth facemasks. supposed stop droplets far tell spread often aerosol data seems done surgical masks N95. real evidence cloth masks continued use security theater? thoughts possibilities long-term (6+ months) autoimmune reactions mRNA-based vaccines? long think know vaccines limit eliminate transmission person person? sub turned respecting safety/science to, ""I'm anti-mask, crazy. Shows over, pandemic done!!"" third country fully vaccinated no, *done*. still lot work going struggle get 70% immunized.  

There hundreds thousands millions Americans like vaccinated (or vaccinated) depend people giving shit 4-8 weeks health issues make vaccine less effective us. Herd immunity true hope normal life. hurts whenever people tell us ""stay home rest us get lives."" want get life too...  

You lot ""living"" vaccinated now. wear mask inside restaurant crowded space outside weeks difficult. make awkward time many vaccinated millions aren't. people would lie vaccinations already back normal, refusing wear masks.

This talking point needs die. There's evidence make logical sense. fine, I'm gonna able see anyone fall anyway. shit better close fall cause I'm done isolating year half friends...until then. fwiw, wore mask times months, love Democrat. definitely people feel high mighty it, people solidarity little bit fear. Days weeks make big difference right now, hopefully succeed! understand it:

The vaccines 100% effective stopping getting virus.
But 100% effective stopping serious reaction (such hospital ICU). 

So get vaccine, get virus, although safe getting seriously ill safe spreading somebody else - possibly somebody hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet! wife also great person call shit. biased calls out, reels going full ""Women gold digging whooooores!"" 

The podcast great, fantastic. probably fits attending full capacity worship service. Basically. Nothing else besides marvel stupidity human race. realize Thanos right deserve live. mean, are, thing. saying? idea believe moment, read. true not.

Sure sounds like casting doubt efficacy numbers. still recall time climbed. Lmao eat mask It‚Äôs also super dangerous people like Alex Jones honorable mentions: DMT cannabis Get well-adjusted adult takes! vaccine actually delivered good vaccine plan get message people believe false conspiracy theories vaccines? honestly think overplaying so-called anxiousness get back normal is, itself, hindering return normal. Get vaccinated, change nothing!

I can‚Äôt imagine would raise eyebrow message. official CDC website. CDC posted this. outsourced critical thinking laxy.  jamie pull video fauci making fun  concerned information broadcasted airwaves? mean far first controversial thing he‚Äôs said.

Also, look past brash use n word  air past? India wrong every said 70% infection rate last January. Even huge surge going right assuming massive undercounting would still take couple years get many infected. find data? NJ covid hub break raw doses given demographic group, say % given 1st dose, 2nd dose. looking it! like Joe, sometimes he's real hypocrite. Pfizer currently optimising vaccine storage normal refrigeration temperatures. also quite number developed countries sufficient cold supply chains order, store administer Pfizer even prevailing temperatures required optimal storage. Please bro fucking close. weeks max. Please. need get Vaccination rates 75% Great argumentation skills. Many viruses give similar long term health consequences, shutdown forever prevent those. COVID different? honestly... heavier..or bit

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and... things ... normal? Washington Oregon two last states open eligibility vaccines everyone. spread groups weren‚Äôt eligible recently. Washington also moved ‚Äúphase 3‚Äù opened schools weeks everyone eligible. It‚Äôs really surprising consider factors. I‚Äôm thinking level sometime next month people start getting second doses. Many people concerned long-term effects Covid. risk long-term effects caught mild case Covid vaccinated?

Also, guys‚Äô take variants? media making scary really are? think Covid could ever develop mutation would make completely immune current vaccines? please explain like I'm 5 mRNA vaccine works? Matrix adjuvant never given millions people illegal people view similar companies say operate countries avoid paying high taxes. think also annoys normal people rich people pay taxes lower income tax places second house another state get reap benefits living second house without pay state taxes. Yes, clearly nearly 50% people vaccinated wearing masks inside... üôÑ exponential growth Often reasonable approach complex topic adopt consensus experts (unless willing put time effort go education process become expert yourself).

I agree 100% Rogan pretend expert vaccines shouldn‚Äôt main source vaccine knowledge. Unless you‚Äôre suggesting one except experts ever allowed discuss complex topic publicly, would eliminate 99.9% posts comments subreddit, individuals decide get information value opinions.

I means expert vaccines, also don‚Äôt believe Rogan is, neither ever stated be. trust people like Fauci much topic, I‚Äôve barely listened Rogan talk subject. would trust opinion Comedy MMA is/was professional both, otherwise would trust expert opinions guests relates topics expertise in. Though even trust experts would seek opinions use consensus expert view trusted opinion. Curious good vaccine produced? arent symptomatically sick, hugely unlikely get anyone else sick, even truly sick?

Weird times.  honestly know. There's enough data outbreaks determine size safe, number isn't. really depends covid activity/case load region, % guests gotten shots. un-vaccinated ppl risk outbreak low, majority guests anti-vax rarely mask public, kind dicey know one could asymptomatic. Seriously... dude actual personality, morphs like whoever he's interviewing. understand enjoying podcast get interesting interactions that, know would make likable individual. I've never really understood India well first wave. seemed served platter respiratory pandemic. time afforded good fortune capitalized on. anyone curious changes time least one EU nation, Netherland's coronavirus dashboard section this, ""Vaccinatiebereidheid"": sits 75%, decent. lower among younger age groups.  Yeah you‚Äôre right. saying I‚Äôm rational feels weird bc I‚Äôm used could maybe possibly consider following radical idea:

Just listen podcast like him? Ok yes. OP, email address phone study coordinator? contact them, use phone number email address (whichever contact info study documents/card) ask info. Really cool heavy metal scene Unless OP edited previous version reply, 0.007% correct calculation given available data. Percentages COVID cases CA occurring fully vaccinated individuals different calculation rate breakthrough infections fully vaccinated individuals. 

0.007% rate breakthrough infection CA line reporting every state that‚Äôs monitoring breakthrough infections. (Granted, likely breakthroughs aren‚Äôt counted everyone tested full vaccination. would assume unreported breakthrough infections either asymptomatic mild brief, thus lack testing/reporting them.) possibly know motivations scientific understanding 2+ million people subscribed here, even thousands people comment?

Moderna quoted South Africa 4x per dose Pfizer. Based solely metric, might find lagging behind. future, developing countries bread butter, might well innovate collaborate order maintain competitive edge - grant licences share know-how (don't assume pay it) may well find ahead game. 

The fundamental mistake Moderna made early outright refusal even apply approval SA earmarked supply EU, US, Canada UK. suddenly found 20m doses one month later, alternative plan already made. dismissive approaches pretty much norm comes part developing world, still unacceptable, particularly month later made clear sufficient capacity offer us doses desperately needed first asked registration process initiated could purchase vaccines. 

OTOH, I'm sure middle-income countries particularly enjoy negotiating Pfizer. cusp putting pen paper finalising contract come something they'd never insist upon developing country. Asking middle-income countries issue establishing running no-fault compensation schemes, providing indemnity paying vaccines they've ordered treated differently wealthier nations. Requesting collateral form sovereign assets and, two three cases backing down, absurd.

If EMA considers Sputnik data insufficient, Russians would first know.  still get spread maybe hold little think depends country Thanks sleuthing - false positive rate .01-.1% (1 10,000 1 1,000) sounds much realistic 1% PCR tests low infection environment. 

At chaotic, busy testing site coupled overwhelmed labs positivity 30-50%, doubt contamination process failures may result higher false positive rate, low positivity rate situations. close think herd immunity, factoring people infected virus (especially we're learning many asymptomatic infections) quickly population vaccinated? wish wasn‚Äôt though....

Remember said wearing mask needed harmful? beginning pandemic, done maybe get bad. he's making dumb people can't critically think even dumber also public health hazard everyone else. ""Don't like listen"" going solve that. It‚Äôs handing platform morphs personality holding accountable terrible misinformation.

and never grew childish mentality can‚Äôt tell do! Common sense useful here. agree, let's wait see. didn‚Äôt say biased UK companies. said politics EU vaccine rollout gone badly UKs gone well. 

I told reason UK took gamble AZ, pharma company know vaccines. tell EU gambled big them. penny pinching? Dr. Barron: continue people get vaccinated complete series. Otherwise, mile short finish line. goal us able liberty aspects lives.  Everyone exposed variants India can't claim uniquely exposed air travel exists. suppressed fuck reporting first wave well.

There‚Äôs even better article topic Atlantic today Zeynep Tufekci, essential follow Twitter want stay informed things COVID.

Every infection another chance virus evolve mutate. Yes. There‚Äôs nothing inconsistent here. person replying said CDC considering sociology recommendations. quote myself: arguing people CDC shouldn‚Äôt try sociologists give recommendations based data, manipulating people.

That sentence isn‚Äôt saying CDC doing, something don‚Äôt think do. There‚Äôs difference. Today second dose Pfizer vaccine. question regarding vaccination, gave vaccine steam blood came spot. cleaned put bandaid it. Blood stopped immediately. ask take blood thinning medicine. said no, healthy 40 years old male. worried normal asked blood thinning medication? already got lots EU shots, yes. Oh okay, that's good know. hope happens soon people stop using excuse get shot I'm feeling better better visiting family NY/NJ july. bar part nonnegotiable family visits.

Regardless, odds probably much higher getting car wreck. Unless develop unusual symptoms like headache, leg/abdominal pain, shortness breath stroke-like symptoms, you‚Äôre fine.  That‚Äôs great news, we‚Äôre still 50,000 new cases day, significantly higher April 2020.

Hopefully cases start coming soon. We‚Äôre still 3rd highest world India Brazil. people start seeing doctors person often, totally take vaccine. true 2020 he's anything like anymore idea:

**Everyone wear mask unless home car household members stay 6' away people.**

That messaging super simple. Reduces spread shitloads diseases, vaccines not. Nobody worry whether still spread respiratory diseases. crap CDC said basically giving bunch people ammo say ""hur dur need wear mask outside, like, ever.""

Why messaging fucked day one? show broadcasters take mask start newscasts. masks sitting desks. Show people behaving responsibly new TV shows instead taking mask walk police station magic.

This you? ""wowowoah fast brainiac!""

-CDC need decide referring ""the eu"", politicians? heads countries eu? eu commission? eu parliament? sure would think that, seen people believe drop hat days?

Social media flooded airwaves w/ misinformation. think much ask popular podcaster country responsibility there.

That said, still hold opinion like him. certainly think otherwise. Exactly That's good point. Policies written vacuum written people knowledgeable. They're written way largest % people get (as shown kid-friendly graph above).

If write something smarter demographic understands it, end non small portion people getting it. Otoh write something less smart portion population understands it, almost everyone understand. lose precision accuracy course, that's acceptable trade-off given alternative. I'd imagine spend lot time ""proving credentials"" blatantly showing deserving them.

That's efficacy calculated. know it. know 2 (sic) stubborn admit it. hate sound like anti masker, wear masks we're immune?  consequences getting flu much less serious  

It‚Äôs quite reasonable put uncomfortableness protect severe consequences. like vaccines, rational risk vaccines, might well watch people eat worms. brash use n word air past?

I think needs context. context matters lot word discussed. come homeless people die? Joe Rogan even comedian? find yelling punchlines funny all. hope doesn‚Äôt give vaccinated people belief don‚Äôt wear masks anymore 
I‚Äôve seeing vaccinated people care peoples safety got vaccine

Pfizer came yesterday saying relation   votes here? We‚Äôve known elderly need immune response. 94% amazing. Even higher preventing death. Dr. Kutner: People react differently vaccine, people significant symptoms others. far particular characteristics associated symptoms vaccine. know symptoms vaccine tend start within 12 hours receiving vaccine resolve within 1 - 2 days receiving vaccine.""

That's point vaccine. ‚ÄúOn recent weekend, met friend downtown Bonn check city's famous cherry blossoms. took photos, grabbed coffee shopping local farmers market, stopped patisserie pick sweet treat lunch ‚Äï course wearing masks. people around us.‚Äù

She‚Äôs kidding. sound *exhausting*.   Ask paid time anything, iirc job obligated give depending location   Spotify could flag episode disclaimer like ""note: episode contains misinformation contradicts consensus public health experts.""

The average listener might able tell difference informed expert opinion random podcast host talking loudly sounding convinced bad advice. There's way around Rogan needing censor hos guests you? bring people agrees with, discuss non controversial things? would think today's world fact-checks allowable opinions vain attempts prevent misinformation, open dialogue would antidote.  could put period ""incorrect"" make always true statement. Dr. Barron: variants circulating, natural immunity may enough help us reach herd immunity. studies South Africa Brazil shown even natural immunity still get reinfected. observed individuals received vaccines. go get vaccinated!  Ok, decide gets speak different topics? experts allowed talk? so, subreddit get deleted since us aren‚Äôt experts anything related vaccines viruses. get position power *should* act better, can‚Äôt silence people disagree with.

He also talks lot psychedelics, many people against, proven help addiction, depression, mental ailments. let court public opinion decide could said regarding psychedelics likely wouldn‚Äôt see legalized therapeutic use different states countries surely lot good.

Feel free share opinions disagree opinions others, shutting discussions never answer. fight bad opinions facts evidence prove otherwise. Fauci doesn‚Äôt suggest silencing people like Joe Rogan.  welcome millions vaccines sent you. still await first shipment across Channel!  CDC guidelines, yesterday, say wear mask find spending time densely attended event like rally outdoor concert... baseball game. don‚Äôt say even think attending event you‚Äôre unvaccinated, say wear mask. It‚Äôs thought 1 every 1,000 COVID cases could traced crowded outdoor event. risk still low. Kids almost *certainly* greater risk infection school playground attending baseball game. 

I say top others said: at-risk cannot get vaccine (do know % population is, way?) drive public policy. would like expected society change accommodate agoraphobia panic disorder. I'm entirely convinced Kelowna, BC Canada (especially pandemic) Joe Rogans garbage spewing podcast. mean yeah, agree Vaccination IDs, that‚Äôs deter anti-vax allowed concerts sporting events. 

You may issue it, many do. lack connection others due masks undoubtly effect humans. Wear mask done want, it‚Äôs incredibly unnatural keeping masks humans reason all. read comment.

I seen anyone voicing concerns China‚Äôs vaccines subreddit, despite using similar methods lack transparency like Russian vaccines. suspect suspicion cast Russian vaccines Russophobia actual evidence unsafe. going over. vaccine doesn‚Äôt make 100% safe, will? People ask question time sort gotcha, truth matter pre pandemic normalcy never ate restaurants outdoors unless vacation something. Sure got vaccinated weeks ago, weather isn‚Äôt reliably warm enough know comfortably sit outside. Pre pandemic ate inside restaurants time, I‚Äôm still waiting second shot I‚Äôm definitely okay waiting longer away year. also see deaths coming points reasons. 

NY - 14 deaths today per Worldometers, 36 per Cuomo's tweet. California - 44 huge population.

Florida? 74. Georgia 71. Texas getting around 60 per day. 

Those 3 states right 200. particularly surprising. 23 emergency ICU beds instated yesterday, 13 already occupied since people waiting one.  can't tell many times got rained on. Yeah going long time, well Trump. brought ugly, hate, violence everyday Also water wet I'm saying impossible differentiate. me, difference clear. presidency would *very real tangible* effects (me Iranian, Muslim ban all).

I'm saying someone like Bill Burr, upper middle high class white man, easy see    live Alabama, hospitalization 300s month (was near 3000 December). actually dropped all-new low 308, 300 since March really even began. Exactly, need comfortable uncomfortable conversations. Silencing people agree solves nothing. Spotify? Caring anything money? NOPE!! Dr. Zane: need look population whole, however, defined. borders, transient. not? example Indian government told Twitter remove criticism handling Covid it

Is free speech issue? Companies restrict free speech based government mob say think giving Alex Jones credibility far worse clip. Rogan said n\* like that. context matter context give little fucks clip. 

As said, he's done worse without using racial slurs all. Context matters. Sending India would better, clearly political UK hoping make trade deals Australia. agree everything government does, vote Boris voted Remain. fact think Boris wanker! think EU wrong particular instance. 

To fair though India ok sent Australia helping now, along lot countries. Dr. Kutner: Important point, especially given people mobile. look local vaccination rates helps target vaccination efforts. look population-level vaccination rates understand close curbing pandemic. Well send Germany France then. hard take seriously shortfall 700.000 doses shipped problem hardly exists. didn‚Äôt tell anyone anything. People take vaccine want.

Again, that's fine. issue timing. Everyone's trying get back theater still fire.

Give population time vaccinate itself. 25% vaccination rate going slightly slow spread. 

Once point virus can't spread easily among public, say two three month's time, *then* lift restrictions.

You jumping gun, going lot covid cases need happen.  ‚Äúif it‚Äôs inconvenient wear mask, im gonna spread germs kill people!‚Äù Vaccination ids.

 


Also masking forever? Meh? bother wearing mask. idea many people get terrible inconvenience. Read epistemology, oddly enough fits well him. remember fauci saying masks use early pandemic. think rogans advice solid faucis flip-flopping based nothing. whole crisis masterclass public communication crisis.

Seriously, hope someone writes book.

So many lives needlessly lost due dumb hell messaging.  Yeahhh it‚Äôs black white. I‚Äôve learned shit ton podcast. certainly added value life. lot people feel way. Taking stance person ALWAYS wrong person ALWAYS right honestly really idiotic. Awesome! Thanks response Nobody cares don‚Äôt listen Rogan. millions podcasts lol. definitely agree differing viewpoints never hallmark high functioning society

We're talking someone using platform spread lies, misinformation vaccine. vaccine keeping people getting sick, functional economy. That's ""viewpoint."" harmful misinformation based nonsense. going cost lives, money. People media literacy know difference. We'll put warning show/ movie going see nipple ass, let fools, liars push public opinion nonsensical narratives. Let's pretend misinformation, lies, propaganda real, weaponized. 

There comes point platforms become complicit enabling misinformation harms society. Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan. freedom say want, mean company obligated spread nonsense. 

I would issue caveat logic regarding matter. live age complete nonsense pushed, costing lives. never feel bad someone using hate, spread lies loses platform. People go bat defend morons like Rogan, they're ones preventing society functioning higher level. People ""tuning out."" We've bad education long, sizable section population process horseshit. particular case, harming country discouraging people getting vaccinated. trying dismiss problem, defend someone poisoning well information, endangering others. People really stupid, chucklefucks like Rogan, others cause damage. people causing damage, making harder shit get back normal. care less Joe Rogan, ton listeners, believe nonsense. Yeah, dont think understand virus spreads.  means ""nearly almost"" impossible.

Maybe me, event occurring several thousand times months virtually impossible.

And, no, use phrase ""one million"" actually calculate odds determine much higher that. Dr. Barron: complications 1976 flu vaccine occurred soon vaccination long-term complications. technology employed COVID-19 vaccines quite different temporary pause instituted J&amp;J vaccine (15 cases 7.5 million) shows safety protocols detect rare events place working. gross ~6 months. antibodies != Immunity. also B cells remember diseases encountered past. encounter disease body ramps antibody production up, considerably faster never seen before.  Life expectancy US also gone like half year Covid. vaccines PREVENT catching covid, stop getting bad enough hospitalized dying. still want minimize chances catching wearing mask, especially around unvaccinated. lot people think vaccine end-all, be-all work way. Bernie Sanders Andrew Yang thing Alex Jones. Neither one make things try gain influence. maybe think government makes frogs gay? suppose did. Adapting science usable population makes assumption people need protected themselves. don‚Äôt see productive. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helps CDC preserve credibility. also don‚Äôt see drives better outcome public health. definitely know isn‚Äôt helping us society economically. 

End rant. That‚Äôs opinion. one needs win lose argument appreciate civil conversation. Good job Taiwan need yearly COVID vaccines? Vaccines make asymptomatic carriers... population vaccinated future worry variants, mutations, etc virus pretty much considered dead. measles coming back anti vaxxers gained traction huge news. Hi!

Ahh, like said, punishments. that, else do?

Exactly this. exact calculation, except use IFR .5%. knew claims areas 60% immunity bogus. would've given IFR like .1, par influenza lol restraint makes good person. anybody says they‚Äôve never thought something shitty like fucking liar lmao. mature people restraint though thats makes us good Latching statement quotes best example comprehension. Check podcast. great. time years back almost went deep usual ""push-back popular mentality"" shtick pulled back gone different level. one funniest comics generation. Ehhh another Washingtonian I‚Äôm glad Inslee‚Äôs far strict. We‚Äôve way less deaths case per capita states (Washington ranked 47th state cases per capita per Worldometers) . Also sure think Florida better twice many cases deaths per 1 million people Washington also mention fact Florida tests less people numbers may even worse.  See, neccessarily judge anyone listens podcast even likes him, I'm him. used pretty damn likeable interesting interviews. Nate Bargatze one favorite comics right (who hillarious weekly podcast way called Nateland) I'm sure great podcast.

Sorry though go ignorance society. Hopefully things atleast gotten little better front last handfull years? want point he‚Äôs always like this. 

I‚Äôm trans every time brings guest talk trans issues it‚Äôs whole mess unchecked transphobia thinly veiled behind ‚ÄúI‚Äôm transphobic buuut‚Äù...

Those us actually knowledgeable negatively affected stunts sounding alarm way back 2016 2017, fans like giant tidal wave young men thought guy kind legend would never listen trans person matter wrong was. 

I think difference isn‚Äôt he‚Äôs gotten worse. It‚Äôs he‚Äôs bad he‚Äôs topics affect people, including listeners podcast, rather small minority groups can‚Äôt easily fight back.

He‚Äôs started punching laterally rather down. India situation then, compared now. younger women ones getting worst symptoms

Sounds like [a good] predictable point whether rate vaccine refuseniks might become infected pad total natural immunity way? can‚Äôt realistically get it, we‚Äôve seen evidence vaccinated people spreading it.

You‚Äôre far risk dying car crash way restaurant. car got struck lightning. Interesting! exact opposite happened me. period lot lighter usual also shorter (it first dose pfizer)  clinical trials apparently big enough find small fraction people end hospitalized.  I'm active listener Joe Rogan podcast heard episode entirety. personally believe vaccine swayed comment Joe made. lots guests agree disagree that's love podcast open dialoglouge. listeners decide own. Assuming sars cov2 vaccines annual thing, think see mRNA versions preferred traditionally developed J&amp;J? think vaccine types continue used? Sorry, I'm sure answer intended OP. 

The strict reality academics knowledge workers ability stay home. rest not. friend allowed leave workplace go acquire COVID-19 test began displaying symptoms. supposed do, let two kids go hungry day? 

In event answer intended different question, helpful use ""Quote Mode"" bottom ribbon bar. familiar Markdown Mode, use right-zircon beginning line, Test test test Sorry meant anti vax  Like what?   also interviewed Bernie Sanders Andrew Yang last election cycle. He‚Äôs allowed give socialist, left-leaning individuals podium right-leaning? No. opinion opinion. stupid thing think say loud. knows Jack shit virus. Full stop.  13-year-old anxiety disorder autism scared go school he‚Äôs vaccinated. insight might able get Colorado?

I got vaccine UC Health well run! son gets shot, want take there. Unfortunately although he‚Äôs anxious vaccinated, major fear needles. extra assistance maybe private room provided people special needs? literally thing vaccines don‚Äôt see anyone voicing concerns it.

Did even read comment? know cultural, Russia/China long approach science; ends always justify means.  6-8 months ago, I'd agree that's valid concern. people would lie sort thing wearing masks though months, ever. 

My comments generalizations obviously, people unique health circumstances additional concerns consider sure. He's great nuance agree you.

Funny works.

70 million fellow citizens btw. vaccine that's 95% effective infection 100% effective severe disease death traditional arguments collective immunity hold. want get COVID? Get shot, done. need force others get shot already guarantees safety COVID. They'll come around eventually stop acting like bunch authoritarian busybodies. good episodes ones hardly talks. doesn‚Äôt get experts more, unsurprisingly it‚Äôs person interviews. 

And rants Covid shutdown California...all affects bottom line probably 1) he‚Äôs lying thinking, it‚Äôs pretty clear neither he, anyone listens him, ever intelligent thought.

I tried nice conversation you, evidently that's possible. good one.  Im glad said this. people realize this, say /do thing. doosh needs get shit-cancelled. Totally agree. actually used fan figuring trans realize much says transphobic. problem presents impartial person wants present facts, way frames arguments relies bad faith interpretation facts skewing fit narrative. saddest part reasonable people fall realize insidious misinformation looks like. Sure, headline still misleading. Fair. I'm speaking regards sociology, virology regard. yes, speaking purely scientifically risks vaccinated people spreading covid outdoors extremely low.

I feel social aspect important though. know somebody antivax hospitalized covid last week. Sure, say fault responsibility, I've personally taken lead example approach whole thing. Even someone country relatively high percentage vaccinated, we're nowhere near ""herd immunity"" threshold. Weighing risks vs reward, believe fair say still transitional phase, wearing masks, even know individual person vaccinated not, know strong majority vaccinated overly lax mindset risking setting us unnecessary harm.

And purely personal thing, understand people pressed wearing mask outside. lot easier constantly putting really big deal all. I'd rather wear whatever. think do, unfortunately people ""well to"" camp.

Sorry repeated lot points lost track I'm replying lol \#CorporateJoe...what sellout. eliminate it? Dr. Barron: certainly possible somewhat unlikely based natural occurrence variants Coronaviruses due mutations occur quite slowly. contrast influenza viruses mutate also acquire genetic elements species likely impact vaccine efficacy. vaccine gone full medical trials. Whats problem, local shaman endorsed yet?  spark joy 4 u? Ah, yes, every scientist dedicated life craft decades make amazing breakthroughs like mRNA vaccines along trick people wearing masks ""power"" guy like Joe Rogan tell difference bacteria viruses knows exactly hes talking about. saw last one Alex Jones, Joe Jamie stop like every 5 minutes fact check Alex saying bc dude goes tangents want make sure misinformation going out. understand perception follow podcast looking seeing guests brings in. guy brings people walks life, #1 listened podcast world. usually go podcast ""well Alex Jones on"" argument. agree said young people get vaxxed dude owns mistakes probably issue apology. Fauci made lot statements aged poorly thr last year.

Let's see one retrospect.

Yes, dont take advice pandemic joe fucking rogan Somers

She's still around? really. guy hit legal speed limit walked away accident minor whiplash thanks seatbelt...but also airbag, crumple zones built vehicle absorb impact, safety measures. whole point safety measures still get places reasonable safe precautions place mitigate danger.  Dr. Zane: last days, logistics vaccine scheduling included self-scheduling walk-up. did, highest level right around new year. LOT cases January, February still pretty bad. One way check numbers looking deaths happened. know deaths lag cases, one analysis saw found 22-day lag best fit predicting deaths cases. Take number deaths January 22 number deaths cases originating 2020. Deaths gone 35.4% since Jan 22, multiply 25% 1.354, get estimated 33.9% infected 22 days ago.  first amendment issue. Twitter government entity, legally censor whomever hell want. like it, first amendment grants right build version twitter moderate however want. bunch nut jobs currently that. coworker listened him. get man. Maybe enrollment military red flag interested Rogan's content. Denying scientific evidence putting people around danger. Nice. Portlander here. close indoor things Friday :(( love sub largely ignored this. Florida excellent Covid response. They‚Äôve managed stay open crush businesses, removed restrictions month ago without seeing huge jumps cases/hospitalizations/deaths/etc. like everybody predicted. point every state following they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs apparent get back semi normal life. Great, thank hosting AMA! glad know something working on. I‚Äôm glad government explicitly telling can‚Äôt do. Makes happy they‚Äôre always looking us :) Covid nonsense spreads aside.. anyone find funny? stand fucking terrible yet he's treated like fucking legend many field. That‚Äôs game day mile radius Camp Randall, day/night people ticketed that. want Exactly sounds like. city. Single city. news Canada approval process vaccines children. aren't. US exclusivity deal pharmaceutical companies. used US. vaccine going grandma India, sitting freezer waiting people US take it. Many regions lifting biggest restrictions (eg: Valencia) yes, we'll see happens next week imposing mask love you? opinion disagree mean I'm imposing belief you? Youre welcome wear mask fool thinking taking risk wearing mask  made fact COVID-19 often leaves people likely permanent smell &amp; taste impairment? see many young people saying need vaccinate risk dying super small. That's true, long-term consequences losing taste/smell (or worse experiencing phantom -bad- smells like cig smoke) could help convince thinking COVID harmless get vaccinated. reason ad/promotional campaigns focused this? Well guess fine movie theater, concert, cruise, theme park, convention industries go under, people need able get enjoy life every while, lot people need jobs put food table.

If wet blanket never wants go anywhere, enjoy yourself, understand people can't live like happy, means lose happiness bonuses, can't expand quickly enough sink resources technology, Ghandi wipe floor us nuclear armageddon still stuck relying cavalry. used people walks life experts field. You‚Äôd get rock climbers, poker players, Bigfoot hunters, geologists, historians, etc. Joe sat back going ‚Äúwaaaaooow‚Äù whole time great. 

Now it‚Äôs ‚ÄúJoe stance, here‚Äôs rando agrees kind minimal qualification make believe him‚Äù. Every episode friends haven‚Äôt accused terrible shit whine agreement everything master Rogan say. wear masks forever? screw Yeah shame people trusting expert, amiright? barely on, paste eating Neanderthal. Like Bill said million times dumb dumbs like you... like it, listen. Nobody cares like podcast. Nobody. fact interesting people podcast time time. isn‚Äôt even personal quality knows? nice hear good news Africa. really need vaccines. EU too! love someone understands this. people claim 6 every 100 vaccinated 65+ end hospital.(which wrong) can‚Äôt call someone shitstain expect anyone take seriously. 

We knew then, like knew 90‚Äôs, 80‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs etc. Racists bad actors cause 99% worlds problems. Worldometers says 722 quite lowest since July (tied mid October) reach today. Also lowest death count since start pandemic last Sunday too. Shit Miriam chick running dem nomination said sane Jones's. whatever name was. Many thanks! Hopefully help get one person vaccinated. orgies fall? Asking friend, friend, friend. dig somebody joke it. That‚Äôs roasting somebody is. know people love podcast. also longest time thought pandemic exaggerated Covid-19 bad.

Do know thought this? heard Joe Rogan believed every word said. Legit using podcast source talking it.

Fuck Joe Rogan, fuck fucking podcast.  Idiots, least 70M America alone. personally still waiting natural selection dang job . IMHO WRONG people died COVID. ones charge protecting us got sick lived BASIC COCKROACHES ü™≥  well let's hope actually end pattern renewing restrictions forever China repeatedly cast doubts safety effectiveness western vaccines state media secretly buying millions doses them. Explain isn‚Äôt shady hell? know China going reverse engineer steal technology claim idea, like everything. UFC commentator, BJJ black belt, comedian podcast host never hidden fact uses TRT (Testosterone replacement therapy), HGH (Human growth hormone).


[Source easy avoid that... getting vaccinated. Death isn‚Äôt thing concerned here. Young people found long lasting complications damage COVID, even they‚Äôre asymptomatic. Abnormal lung scans, heart tissue inflammation, neurological symptoms, etc. showing otherwise healthy young people. study asymptomatic student athletes showed cardiac inflammation potential long term damage, example.‚Äô simple mind take understand people still influence audience even turn camera say ""DO X"" ""DON'T Y"".  Dr. Kutner: Thank caring COVID patients! waiting recommendations FDA regarding timing booster shots. thinking likely summer, although exact timing yet.  damage done. really wish people would think responsibility public thousands millions audience. It‚Äôs one thing spout uninformed opinion group chat, another it‚Äôs worldwide podcast. isn‚Äôt thoughts feelings anymore. 

The frustrating part rebuttal simple - okay, maybe young healthy people don‚Äôt need worry severe cases Covid. known start. young healthy people still get Covid pass others may young healthy. Public health - it‚Äôs name!! It‚Äôs people sometimes!

Also emotional panic ‚Äújabbing kids‚Äù okay dude don‚Äôt get kids vaccinated. kids can‚Äôt even GET vaccine right now! let‚Äôs talk reality Exactly. You‚Äôve stated better could ever have. People going crazy never listened podcast he‚Äôs saying. It‚Äôs tough say right putting box ‚Äúhe‚Äôs danger society he‚Äôs always wrong‚Äù idiotic thing do. disagree him, that‚Äôs fine. see big issue people want scream cancel without ever discussion things. 

He‚Äôs advocating MONTHS taken vitamin taking care way make sure you‚Äôre getting covid. true people end ICU obese vitamin deficient. saying MONTHS public health official saying this. Taking care body number 1 way ensure safe covid. There‚Äôs nothing controversial that. wearing KN95 masks vaccinated. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated ok switch clothe reusable masks? study point people COVID much likely get side effects vaccine Dr. Zane: risk severe illness death COVID many times risk complications vaccine any. risk-benefit analysis strongly favors vaccine. Fuck shit, Joe right Lol DMT knew sure U posted studies see works.

Likely?

You think u beat 95 percent efficiency vaccine lol 

Even studies vaccine efficiency dependent 

In crisis occurred.  Hey that‚Äôs cool all. needs stop saying shit that‚Äôs gonna make pandemic last longer. platform like has, can‚Äôt say whatever dangerous shit want shout cancel culture people call bullshit. Yes no. 

I‚Äôve right leaning voter life. 2016 didn‚Äôt even know Mitch McConnell was. know life story details various politicians ever imagined would. 

I‚Äôm one. Trump changed everything. 

And spare ‚Äúrepublicans bad since Nixon‚Äù. can‚Äôt compare bush Reagan literal moron running superpower ground half country cheers. Dr. Barron: Based medical history, risk contracting COVID-19 developing complication much higher risk blood clot. ah, you‚Äôll block can‚Äôt argue ridiculous expectation people remain masked indefinitely getting vaccine. surprising. Joe Rogan Goop bros I'm fine opinion. long decent enough respectful enough others wear anyway people expect to.

I absolutely problem mask scepticism, long entering people's place work leisure, refusing simple, mildly uncomfortable thing politely ask make feel safer. dont worry modi already sold us begging usa. got told can't book spa appointment another state even though fully vaccinated, proof (card, appointment emails, video getting shot) STILL telling allowed I'm quarantining. 

WHY THING. Even CDC says vaccinated people need quarantine unless symptoms!!!

This complete utter unscientific bullshit. end? **I know sounds like privileged, ignorant thing complain about**, really wearing people's mental health feel like walking death sentence even done part gotten vaccinated. 

I'm suffering depression, holy shit I'd close end. way living. sucks one trust other, respect other. sucks people ignore science even ""other"" side. sucks people avoid ignore fact they've done part 99.9999% healthy. 

I'm done this. cannot even think straight more. 

I got chastised going gym despite antibodies (verified multiple times) since March 2020 getting shot literally soon could. God forbid try take care health. 

Thank listening rant. based Joe Rogan go wear mask makes happy let us faces back vaccinatedninstead trying impose mask love others Dr. Zane: interesting question. appears though rate immunity COVID infection wanes much quickly vaccinated individuals.  people don‚Äôt go school colleges? harm good right terms trying get people vaccinated already appointments. Giving freedoms they‚Äôve vaccinated get fence sign up, cdc coming saying yeah go outside without mask long you‚Äôre alone, everywhere else still need mask. That‚Äôs going convince people go get  50% US vaccinated. 50% adults vaccinated. 

Let alone 50% 30 crowd ???? easier block you. wore bicycle helmet cycling desert right past Mojave. Wrong dude asking act like idiot...just danger sight. We're close enough, wonderful weekend. Ah classic telling I'm saying using words never used. trying say know read? saying masks pointless there's COVID? don‚Äôt know. point already really good immunity. Would getting vaccinated give immunity? Maybe maybe not. would need see data. first comment thread responding you. can't even keep track arguing with. think true Department Education says pupil‚Äôs LFT taken supervision, tests sites school, ‚Äúthe chance incorrect minimal need test confirm result.‚Äù6¬†But ‚Äúslightly higher chance‚Äù positive result wrong test taken home, confirmed PCR.

My university requires LFTs PCR testing running moment contamination concerns.  would next, ask ID enter bar buy beer grocery store ? Show ID board plane ? immagine oppression require know licenses operate vehicles public roads ?  5% odds catching non-severe illness person sick. I'm taking mask off. Unless there's sort leak I'm unaware AZ knew risk failed report, purpose serve? would prosecute company actively saving lives pandemic? think one thing people post regularly social media post got COVID, thinking family specifically post every moronic thought online without filter.

For enough introspection realize should, one moment, actually shut stretch best. think capacity could easily mock continue posting maskless photos ""no one tell do"". biggest thing give Biden credit smooth vaccine rollout took control. federal response support wanted expected.

We can't compare prior Pres opportunity said, appears Biden administration write vaccine distribution plan. words, huge chance vaccination program would stumbled gate fraction now. course unrelated. Francenis full antivaxxers though, so... Pfizer Moderna amazes me. Moderna late every shipment Canada consistently shorts shipments.

Please show science(tm) vaccination immunity proven superior longer lasting natural infection It‚Äôs individual personal issue though, people refuse vaccination clearly don‚Äôt care people. Therefore, won‚Äôt care acknowledge exist. still missing point? Would like explain again? Ah, thanks They‚Äôre already gone half country. wear one places actually cause scene don‚Äôt. Wow. Lotta cynicism here. Guess struck nerve. gonna bother correct lol Yes, moved apartment- pet senetary back garden. Since then, buried 2cats dog cooperation burial ground. Apparently, one cannot burn corpse another species crematorium us. I'm Chennai. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Literally everyone know still unless they're fully vaccinated. IIRC came CDC's original vaccinated person guidelines. think reason there's big hubub CDC specifically referencing pre-pandemic activities saying fully vaccinated people again. HRV tanked testing HR shot up. night heavy drinking that. Moderna 2 stressful knew worth it. PS: monitor glucose shot 4 days also. Basically body physical stress. I‚Äôm 61 male controlled BP, diabeties, weight, cholesterol enough sleep. Technologies, sure. Moderna's non-US supply chain bit mess. keep missing delivery targets slashing projections. Hopefully get back smoother operation coming weeks. Fully vaccinated people **don't need wash hands**? skin destroy Covid contact?  vaccine nationalism.... sadly many variants covid already it‚Äôs quite obvious virus mutates.

Yes, virus mutates. existing mutations selected ones contagious B.1.1.7 king mean you‚Äôre safe today, reach heard immunity, virus continues mutate, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed variant emerge protected vaccine.

The virus continue mutate people animals even ever reach herd immunity. long enough timeline almost certain we're going get mutation selected evades current immunity. question long timeline likely much impact people normally live life compared various restrictions place timeline. It‚Äôs cruel Thank you, appreciate advice. Pretty much everyone know vaccinated got covid. feels like even rushed weekly grocery trip risk despite mask vaccine given sheer prevalence. Stressing thinking diabetic elderly uncle there! vaccine keep getting virus, prevents severe symptoms hospitalizations. We've seen reinfections, rare, might still take out. something I'd like deal with. new data impending doom would occur year spread leading ~30% people acquiring natural immunity implementation highly effective set vaccines? 

There way ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù approached sort scientific consensus. Yeah, cause nobody wants stick neck give actual number. Everyone different opinion acceptable risk level is, politician wants set bar themselves. think great governor VW doing, setting clear goals terms vaccination triggers reduced restrictions, need that. 70% ""correct"" number? depends ask, ends translating reduced cases deaths. start, always tweaked later needs be.

Setting goal 0 cases deaths reasonable, taking position lifting restrictions everyone vaccine eligible. need people vaccinated, we're currently still place Covid 3rd leading cause death country, acceptable opinion. Governors responsibility protect citizens, vaccine let abdicate responsibility.  Got J&amp;J shot yesterday. Currently feel tired decent muscle aches. Symptoms slightly worse get flu shot. I'm male 20's apparently young people symptoms stronger immune systems. anecdotal friends similar symptoms. Rogan basically said young people don‚Äôt need vaccine they‚Äôre low risk Covid. White House felt need respond refute claims. 

This good young people desperately need actual reason feel need vaccinated. Protecting people lives pretty good motivator. also think recent guidance CDC put also good step providing incentives Oh, miss article talking cancellation normal things? looks like article talking cancellation Burning Man... OP said thought summer supposed ""lit"". 
 
That's quite leap made assume talking things, maybe extra chromosome boosts deductive reasoning? UK yes, EU no. Ohio vaccine demand cratered less 40% fully vaccinated? :( things do, curfews least effective. places curfews still kept grocery stores restaurants open, make crowds places bigger people rush work. kind stance towards anti-vaxxers constructive. acknowledging invalidating concerns serves widen divide ‚Äúthem us‚Äù. effective approach includes listening validating concerns helping work risk analysis again. okay, always use force plebs. first, wishing people would stop spreading narrative censorship means 

[Moderna Pfizer vaccines may block infection well dose Pfizer AZ cut household transmission 50% vaccines 90% effective infection, regardless symptom variants: 

[Vaccines still effective British, South African, Brazilian appear effective India covid reported covid deaths day despite several variants spreading going get much worse straight covid deaths structure starts breaking down. Disease spread bodies can't get cremated quickly, rats, flies, etc etc. Yay! I'm vacationing NYC first time June I'm hoping keeps openeing Ok maybe dumb question y‚Äôall wear masks drive thru window? Like stop right? I‚Äôm vaccinated. 2 things:

Can give cite false positive rate?

Also, would also take false negative rate effect want count false positive rate. tbf spotify paid shit load money, stuck sunk cost fallacy

&amp;#x200B;

Other sponsors lest vested interest though Yes that‚Äôs exactly get vaccinated hope bar Cuomo goes makes order food office. Since death reporting lags weeks everyone think current death rate is? wish could say surprised. groupthink strong sides. hard stay rational middle.

The study seems pretty clear: infection provides protection comparable even better vaccines long we've able study both.

Saying yesterday would unscientific irresponsible. today, there's reputable study showing it, time adapt new reality. Unless I'm missing something. What‚Äôs crazy mRNA vaccines literally basic building block vaccine make. dead virus. proteins. pure letters Fauci ""nudge numbers up"" 85% recently?  coworker felt terrible days getting shot 2. bit tired 2nd shot. pushing hand washing mask warring IMO Would lot stronger argument EU helped fund plants.

[Two officials said EU‚Äôs contract committed paying 336 million euros \($406 million\) AstraZeneca, mostly finance production vaccines four named factories. Two these, run Oxford Biomedica Cobra Biologics, Britain, others Germany Belgium. ‚ÄúPart money went UK,‚Äù one officials Almost certainly far Massachusetts resident -- that's set here. QR code, sign appointments time. Would mind sending study? looking recent information, doesn‚Äôt seem unified consensus this, essentially amounts ‚Äúif there‚Äôs 50% chance rain, bring umbrella case.‚Äù 

Science always changing best method fighting is, wearing masks super easy. recommendation wearing mask probably place ‚Äújust case updated studies change recommendation again‚Äù. suggesting mask tiny bit longer it‚Äôs needed guarantees another wave won‚Äôt happen wrong, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good thing. Lol seriously! west valley inferno. :D 

I grew 70's 80's summers hot, like this! people can‚Äôt even agree basic subject matters ‚Äúdigital covid certificates‚Äù validated globally yet developed standard less 2 months. dont convince (lack of) validity waiting 'plant based' vaccine =p use numbers Fauci saying since last summer, 3/100k Cases (""10,000 US Cases day"") still testing would target.

WHO guidance since last spring ""under control"" less 5% positive results (with ""extensive testing"").

The target vaccination number danced around bit we've seen differing levels infections COVID variants (R values), actually get 70-80% eligible population think Public Health Officials pretty happy (although always encourage more, that's ok).

If want extrapolate Deaths Cases, US 2% CFR, 10k Cases would 200 Deaths. saw someone else post Influenza ""burden"" (average daily deaths) varied 30 - 170 depending severity past 50 years.

So, continued testing: Daily Cases 10k; Positivity Rates 5%; resulting Average Daily Deaths lower 200. point, reasonable Public Health guidance advise caution avoid outbreaks - little broad population restrictions (imo). get two different types vaccine healthy homeless people cough mouth without danger. would have. know downvoted. latest CDC guidelines clearly show vaccinated individuals loosen safety measures except outside socially distanced. mean get full round one full round another? mean get booster different first dose? pfizer study measured efficacy one week. Google study.

Edit, here's study  news, putting head underwater long periods time recommended. businesses also hurt, restaurants employ 10% US labor force, shutting high impact local economies. Leaving open social distancing easy ""fix"".

I would preferred help came form stimulus instead tradeoff allowed COVID spread, required government support, pretty minimal. dubious 'issues' stated, still higly effective vaccine UK getting en masse extremely low risks. chance happening. UK still priority doses manufactured UK plants set initially UK government run UK-based company contract UK Government, whatever Belgian courts say. That‚Äôs fill finish site. Basically make liquid Belgium Netherlands send various plants, like one Italy. liquid filled Italy Catalent site Maryland. mean, Pfizer measured efficacy 1 week second dose, Moderna two. CDC considers two weeks past second dose either vaccine fully vaccinated.

Did misread original question? HA knew it! lived way kid - nothing better frozen lawns hail winter high triple digit smog days summer. When? measure antibodies months start? Since otherwise possible antibodies decreased significantly some, whereas talking situation (actually measuring current antibody rates) may antibodies amount higher protection live Madison. personally know single adult vaccinated.

Also, approximately 92% adults 65 older least partially vaccinated county. Still vaccinate feeling pretty good normal Madison things summer.  dont think new vaccines survive there's less demand pump quickly possible.

I could see pfizer winning vaccine years gone by. Moderna excellent, too, may struggle marketshare small company. Well, also first human-approved mRNA vaccine ever, even positive they'd work. also multiple mRNA vaccine companies still EUA finished Phase III going time scaling (Novartis).

Just mRNA mean gimme get point. looks way since two major players mRNA they're executing extremely well. Lots mRNA groups get point. like IT, done extremely well looks simple easy, almost one extremely well. Seems spotify [not science mask deniers would eventually end getting covid apart herd immunity vaccinated would. 

Maybe not, due reinfections. 

Luckily, got effective vaccines quickly, able get that. similar app California. like seat belt necessarily offer best protection reckless. still take precautions, like using turn signals following speed limit, deaths serious injuries get massively reduced accidents *do* happen. thing Covid.

Also, get everyone vaccinated (that feasibly can, anyway) number potential vectors low away precautions. masks social distancing, reservoir infectious individuals. That's mostly worry Measles, Mumps, Polio, Smallpox, drastically reduced eliminated vaccines (barring occasional outbreak Measles due people thinking need vaccines anymore). site Italy I‚Äôm quite sure it‚Äôs larger Here's ELI5:

\-An adenovirus vector vaccine inserts DNA make coronavirus Spike protein typically harmless virus human adenovirus 5 (Ad5), normally causes mild symptoms all. Furthermore, vector virus engineered *can't* replicate human body, cell culture tanks (it requires engineered human cells replicate, found actual human body, find injected someone's arm).

\-In cell culture tanks, *possible* adenovirus regain DNA sequence allows replicate human body.

\-If happens, caught vaccine manufactured, vector virus vaccines manufactured specific cell culture able replicate normal human body. means vaccine actually make sick vector adenovirus (NOT coronavirus, clear).

\-For majority people concern. fact, people even notice precisely adenovirus typically cause mild respiratory disease healthy humans; however, cause life-threatening infections immunocompromised patients. course would make unnecessary safety risk.

Since Anvisa found vector virus replicating batches, decided approve vaccine. raises many manufacturing questions. Lots people haven't, focus public interactions, people rules-based rather reasons-based careful private interactions. COVID spread sort hidden way, family get togethers, private parties etc. even people follow rules public places. mean depends, right? you‚Äôve gotten before, immunity base Covid, don‚Äôt variant. kind covid area base covid, help, you‚Äôre place like Michigan covid cases variant point, doesn‚Äôt help work towards herd immunity. 

I think they‚Äôre avoiding talking makes math harder don‚Äôt want complicate messaging. Super cool article. mean, probably last push unvaccinated people feel incentivised go ahead get it. state show need urgency, people probably feel compelled. Makes sense. I‚Äôm saying anectodes evidence all! It‚Äôs surprising statistic given personal experience, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. Yes person sick. need explained 95% means? Credible cite that? I'm slowly working new daily megacomment.

You've seen old one? weird like know LEAST 10% country (~33M cases) confirmed infected, also easily assume far (5x-10x) confirmed. factor numbers vaccinations far people immunity really seem accounted business social engineering.

You're absolutely right. reasoning own, CDCs. almost certainly rely completely numbers science make decisions, social engineering. current numbers 29.1% people fully vaccinated. Meaning virus still spread vaccinated person's wearing mask benefit (all else equal)

You realize vaccines 100% effective, right? like 85-90%. 10-15% people could get infected, even vaccinated, would definitely receive benefit wearing mask virus continues run rampant. Anything less erodes public trust (myself included) them

Then ""informed science"" like portray. dislike much, classic example person cares perceived people like community integrity4 done appear macho, manly reckless ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù, completely irrational self centered. Look England. Whatever hell world, including us important, super-special Americans! Idk man used hold give shots kid cuz hated needles much, still tense see look away think football something hate needles first shot stung like üêù. Ouch!! really dreading second shot, didn‚Äôt feel all. well may come up, exclusively that. general address joint session Congress. called state union made first year yet, nearly format.

He'll probably talk good bit infrastructure bill, sure, also expect hear first 100 days, state pandemic, general policy vision, etc. top that. would suggest taking day regardless. Everyone gets different (or no) side effects.  Well everybody united states got vaccinated 82 million people would side effects yeah ""everyone"" feel ill lot people Important note everyone vaccine, people vaccine *who get infected.* first shot reduces infections 50-80% (low end believe among elderly people, studies counted infections less 2 weeks first shot. Overall likely middle high end this.) cuts transmission risk among vaccinated 40-50%, greatly reducing risk vector even 1 dose. Absolutely. think one better studies showing significant decrease viral load vaccination Pfizer. initial preprint made big ruckus released, published shows vaccines attenuate reaction virus we're exposed, dramatically reduce amount virus body. Basically, body eliminate viral particles enter body quickly time reproduce. Less virus body means less potential spread others. 7 months ago, we‚Äôve holding October numbers close two months now.  I'm still gonna wear mask everywhere also still eating restaurants outdoors? ""Oh even though driver's license can't kill people car? would even bother point it?"" really think track see restrictions lifted sometime summer. Statewide positivity rate already sub-2% even close seeing full force recent ramp vaccinations seasonality come next months. I‚Äôll start saying haven‚Äôt listened much he‚Äôs released last year, used listen regularly would frequently state lack expertise topics providing opinion. likely would disagree opinion vaccines, usually experts better opinions it‚Äôs informed listener decide opinions carry weight statements hold tests.

He‚Äôs big promoter putting ideas multiple perspectives letting ideas speak rather believing everything hear 1 point view. Again, sounds like he‚Äôs wrong side issue, informed discussions better way settle disagreement silencing groups don‚Äôt align perspective.

Yep. based assumptions many people would ultimately get infected completely unvaccinated population working there. 

They're estimating roughly 80% population would contract COVID-19 vaccine - 264M people. Working there, 95% efficacy reduces number 13M people - 0.04% population.

Like speedy end pandemic. Said healthy young people (21 year olds case) absolutely get vaccinated.

That's Oklahoma ya. state sucks. Hey thanks letting know. interesting. hilarious people like reality I'm going continue wear mine times (outside home) majority vaccinated.

We're already stage people think weird wear mask. People still going indoor business (even always) even weeks leading mask mandate lifted, outdoors like 1 20 wearing mask including crowded park. Uber drivers seem upset take mask entering vehicle. ""I know rules think dumb take off"" general attitude.

It's really better wear even outdoors ask me. know everyone like ""but science says spread outdoors"" uh no, outdoors mitigate spread (especially non crowded environment) prevent it. Much importantly though, even vaccine, even protected, we're creating environment 80% fully vaccinated close 70% vaccinated (in area), people lie vaccine.

Vaccination rate already seems slowing here, big problem people getting second dose. get it, science says already protected fairly high rate one I'm really astounded complete lack discipline throughout whole pandemic, moreso people bothered right thing, I'm talking covidiots. get CDC water things get people comply please mess end mask little longer. pandemic shown everyone outright malicious, vast majority people focus ""eh illegal"" rather ""I right thing"".

Second, pandemic disproportionately impacts old people. months get vaccine works *exceptionally* well. Kids can‚Äôt get yet. don‚Äôt take kids Braves game don‚Äôt want. slowly going move collective choices, impacted hospital rates deaths amongst elderly, personal choices.

""Attend crowded, outdoor event, like live performance, parade, sports event."" long I'm vaccinated (which am) wear mask, outside concerts safe enough now? similar, different scale. Hanging 5-15 unvaccinated people family vs surrounding hundreds/thousands unvaccinated people.

I'm expert field, I'm sure significant difference is, suspect difference. 

In event, low number breakthrough infections far gives confidence vaccines effective.   Preventing infections incorrect. Preventing severe covid term. Yeah, people saying bad idea care fact... care spreading doomsday narrative.  Booster vaccine. like flu vaccines. mask needs go 7 billion people. current plan beyond failure thus far. they're not, attitude nihilism. fuck nihilism. many variables masks could account this. think people eventually stop wearing them. doubt health policy body like CDC say ‚Äústop entirely forevermore‚Äù.


But also whenever it‚Äôs flu season, courtesy, people wearing masks. already norm lots countries it‚Äôs rly super inconvenient got 2nd Pfizer shot 3 weeks ago yesterday caught whatever bug toddler brought home daycare. logical brain says it‚Äôs cold it‚Äôs unlikely covid, irrational side stressing. least acknowledge riskier take vaccine.

Anyone dying COVID today would got infection number weeks ago. need look many vaccinated *as month ago* rather many vaccinated date.

Also, vaccine wait give take three weeks immunity build up. someone unlucky enough catch COVID soon vaccine, may vulnerable someone unvaccinated.

Finally, although vaccine enormously reduces risk death, still zero.

On positive note, start seeing death rate come rapidly soon. No. I've definitely loosened rules getting vaccine (specifically I've met vaccinated people generally felt ease outside home).

I think regards mask wearing, vaccinated people continue wearing masks (even outdoors) specifically yet vaccinated large enough percentage population. wearing masks now, creating environment encourages widespread maskless interactions 75% vaccinated many lie, case numbers, relatively low compared winter explosion still comparable last summer needed take seriously.

[Vaccine Admin. vs Pct. NHW -- Note clustering Conservative-leaning counties bottom-right, would throw linear Admin. vs Pct. Rural -- Clear trends urbanized counties, whole different spread 100% rural, probably determined unknown imagine disappointment Public Health student decided ignore empirical evidence underlying trends favor examining political sentiment age, linear model statistical power tests said (while mostly ignoring mathematical effect structures present underlying data priority-group designation seniors public policy earlier pandemic). became even disheartened realized general Public Policy Health experts probably taking exact tack.

As perpetually low-income POC largely observed hourly laborer Black &amp; Latin friends get infected course pandemic (even recently last week), white yuppy ""well off"" friends boomers ability drive &amp; wait 5 hours somewhere straight fly anywhere else, I'm deeply frustrated whole situation. personally able schedule first shot three weeks ago writing bot hit campus' vaccine website soon read Outlook email alert. vast majority, I'm actually observing people procrastinate getting vaccine otherwise occupied, recently infected workplace, simply burned entire hype machine surrounding buried heads sand -- distrust vaccine proper political leaning, necessarily.

**Direct Questions:**

* Ball Arena mass-vaccination site going online, expect see situation actually improve, given whole block intersection somewhere people try avoid driving to?
* additional policy decisions could include guard-rails ensure vaccination access becomes possible us impacted loudly wanted vaccine since trials announced complete, unable acquire it?
* adaptive supply-chain logistics place Colorado shift doses areas demand highest, observable metric accounts real demand vaccinations (if either even exist)?
* Given limitations time-frame dataset, new evidence suggest trends I've noted previously actually reversed recent weeks?
* stands leading factor among general public public policy less-effective-than-desired keeping Replication Rate lower? structural issues within public discourse attributed something federal mismanagement 2019/2020? changes planned approaching crisis future (given possibility one-off next 50 years, conjecture based presentations John Oliver interviews microbio people YouTube)?
* larger awareness viral diseases spread, continue see drop-off pneumonia, influenza, common cold?
* limitations exist mRNA vaccination treatment developments? we've begun crack code use associated techniques en masse, possibilities exist future mRNA treatments?
* Finally, I'm burdened knowledge, strategies use ignoring de-stressing personally harmful way? focusing carbon emissions drought data another project, addition ""human factors"" research, policy, higher education, everything else going on; I'm split graduating semester becoming ski- beach- bum, apprenticing trade, becoming goat herder another continent. I'm tired feeling like Cassandra jacked internet connection, strapped train tracks zero realistic way escaping, I'm watching train barrel us all.

**Errata**

I'm glad upload plots, backing dataset sources, code used generate findings (except Public Health student's linear modeling work, I'm currently talking them).  doses Halix plant argument? also shortfall local production funded EU plants contract. Fauci also said wear masks beginning, wouldnt help...Fauci also said really incorrect things. care get free pizza Chuck E. Cheese long it. Yeah. probably peak sometime May.  didn‚Äôt imply said that, didn‚Äôt mean imply it.

I meant imply, explicitly stating, people rightly questioning ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind CDC saying vaccinated people need wear masks.

It‚Äôs science. It‚Äôs social engineering. feel like discussion masks sucks air room talking ways increase vaccine uptake like cash payments get second dose, better distribution communities, firing Joe Rogan.

Clearly CDC think mass unmasking good idea present time, approaches might work lot better anyway.

(I also find annoying blame messaging placed public health people people like Tucker Carlson lying virus year now) Wow, spin. ""only"" one four. ""mild"" systemic side effects. 

If flu shot gave mild systemic side effects one fourth time, I'd imagine lot less people would interested taking it. Fauci considering mental health young adults Even June vaccines still needed. Astra promised lot millions EU still counting speed things up. Hah same. 2nd Pfizer shot mom felt chills like 2 hours good. mean time I'm bundled like winter feeling chills, body aches, etc. Got 2nd shot yesterday afternoon feeling like night. goal vaccinations wholly eliminate COVID, turn something mild manageable like seasonal flu.

If got infected symptoms, plan working. Lol know abt u Dr. Barron: NO!!!!!!! I'll take over-reaction inadequate reaction. Every time.

I hate dipshit made hay making COVID political thing. isn't. freedom thing, rugged individualism thing. death thing.

At least now, see clearly wore signs proclaiming it, selfishness stupidity walks among us. could done shit long time ago. people listen scientists dragging fucker out. Everything said 100% doubt. great seeing deaths hospitalizations go down. 60% enough though still means,  

-there's enough population base unvaccinated virus (plus varients) spread  

-people still get sick and/or long-term effects even hospitalized  

-people like immune compromised vaccinated still risk  

herd immunity still end game. failure west. US Europe produced much vaccine Russia China able use vaccines propaganda tools. Weird picked cockroaches left jizz. literally dared people drink donkey jizz money. world cray. wait period get second vaccine test positive (with symptoms) week getting second dose?  Dr. Kutner: No. NJ here, city vaxx site, got shot bandage 30 seconds less walked reaction waiting area already gotten text email confirming appoinment already made me, 21 days later, time. utterly shocked efficiency! thought family got it. Wife smell taste anything weeks. taste went little weird lungs hurt. tested negative multiple times though. Maybe get would 4 tests come negative? Anyways, get second vaccine ten minutes. Dr. Zane: No. people get vaccinated, masks forever, COVID forever. Roll sleeves, get shot, part. love people complain ""cancelling"" free speech people actively participating capitalism. think Joe Rogan idiot think go jail saying something stupid. think though people consume content get paid much capitalism, consider cancelling gives fuck  It‚Äôs UK, it‚Äôs Astra taking EU money apparently production enough show it. Astra diverting UK that‚Äôs EU order 400 million AstraZeneca doses according EU biased AZ based UK?

The EU initially ordered 100 million Pfizer/Biontech, developed produced EU, 400 million AZ. sound like anti-UK bias me. still nearly 1k people US dying covid

Despite vast overwhelming majority risk people receiving one doses vax  Definitely biased headline way last year trolling us all, bet it'll 69%. who's vaccinated bc young: ._. don‚Äôt care continue wear mask even vaccinated, I‚Äôm place majority vaccinated told wear mask problem that. PDF pages 60 62.  mean, even 50% antibodies 10% vaccinated, still talking +400 million people India. Wish people would spend energy ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù China Russia instead random celebrities. Dr. Zane: correlation auto-immune illnesses related mRNA vaccines way, shape, form. wonder Duncan Trussell still talks him, love Duncan. Hi, thanks ama! two part question:

1.) Looking current US vaccination trends efficacy rate Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J think US able reach critical mass herd immunity?

2.) If/when reach herd immunity day-to-day life look like?  watches big bang theory once.... starts talking smart... everyone dumb? Dr. Zane: Pretty far. Unless people start getting vaccinated rapid pace. reached supply-demand inversion much supply demand sad state affairs half left vaccinate.  that's crazy. went back normal last May basically. even went Mexico February, blast. Everyone get lives. reason put mask bullshit anymore. people take many views, long views curated Joe Rogan. Lol ok. See Charles Michel, president European council spreading lies UKs ‚Äúoutright ban‚Äù vaccines components. thing, least wasn‚Äôt trying to.

The person replying ascribed motives, asserting motives, lose credibility. Eventually, always becomes clear people going on. Yes early got doses, long time. get AZ sucked delivery, EU saying wants UK doses. argument, give us doses EU plants make shortfall. US, 37 people killed 113 injured vending machines since 1978. Bullshit. censoring Dominick Cruz  deaths good ALL; however, are, piss ocean compared experienced last year. late, already intended effect, Rogan‚Äôs followers almost cult-like think he‚Äôs kind insightful yogi type. It‚Äôs really big joke nobody‚Äôs laughing. Yup, easily schedule appointment vaccination, choose to, probably stuff CDC says safe vaccinated people (gathering small groups outdoors eating outdoor restaurants) anyway. Dude beaches packed northeast last summer infection rates insanely low. 

Outdoors concern. listen Joe Rogan medical advice..   subscribe XM Radio/Sirius, paying Joe Rogan spread lies.

In case wondering stop funding Joe Rogan, ask canceling, tell Joe Rogan. Meanwhile India...""good luck everyone else"" makes sense. Thank much  Dr. Zane: Maybe, people continue meticulously wash hands stay home symptomatic. certainly, continue wear masks.  Right. gonna hand someone like microphone, better hard fuck him.

He wasn't.

Also, exists people love see people good time. makes feel better lives guess didn‚Äôt get memo we‚Äôd already proclaimed pandemic over. Exactly. I‚Äôm anti vax, vaccinated. whole thing let people make decision. whole notion need everyone get vaccine don‚Äôt want reach herd immunity harm good. one something feel forced do. Herd immunity reached one way another, make sure risk get vaccinated hospitals fine death rates plummet  Read second paragraph comment. Dr. Zane: myriad ways get vaccinated across Colorado ample capacity drive-through, walk-up, scheduled clinics pharmacies. problem demand supply. Immunity infection vs immunity vaccine. 

I choose option 2. Why?  know said I'd wear mask required Bill Burr also complained guy walking outside wearing mask min later podcast talk show later night telling people come show ya Rogan asshole like one time xbox game channel.

There's consistent pattern. I'm cancelling anyone, I'm pushing back guy who's clearly gone rails good.

Here's [Exhibit way. back 5000 breakthrough cases reported nation wide (out think 70 mil plus vaccinated). California makes 12% US population, basically makes sense account I‚Äôm sure general small increase breakthroughs. crazy framing‚Äîthese breakthroughs remain freakishly rare imagine result incredibly mild cases besides ascribing motives without evidence. drool rollercoasters, recommend riding them.

Not covid, that's gross. Hello! I‚Äôm fully vaccinated work grocery store. increasing amount customers wearing masks it‚Äôs making nervous. wear fabric mask times work unless drink eat something. still worried customers? I‚Äôm sales floor way keep 6 feet them. Today ordered face shields wear addition mask. Astroturf harder. think many people actively look forward injection. younger given gas air could even give injection dislocated broke finger. relish thought, I've calmed loads must say vaccine jab one straightforward painless ever. physically tense still! Dr. Kutner: sorry struggling. experience pandemic definitely increased anxiety people. suggest discuss concerns regular health care behavioral health provider work together identify approaches helping navigate this. wish well. really think Joe Rogan going privileged audience? audience blue collar. I'm going put money fact Rogan moved Spotify numbers down. best way milk cow get name media, negative positive. chose path. Care elaborate? British media shit general. moral compass, boundaries, fake sense fairness, sanctimonious. read drivel 20 years. Exceptions times, FT sometimes guardian. cunningly dishonest one without doubt telegraph.  I'm child 60's. I've measles, mumps, whooping cough, chicken pox, labyrinthitis, viral pneumonia, influenza, bronchitis covid, mention bacterial infections streptococcal pharyngitis, think immune system proven deal infections.

Good luck vaccines. two people stating opposing opinions facts. Carry He's sycophant. could tell I'm going go drink snake venom let scorpion sting toughen help fight Covid, he'd probably come me. body create antibodies lipid nanoparticles used mRNA vaccines, so, would problem booster shots? flu season numbers rapid test came back positive today. 

Are symptomatic? vaccines throughout history really provide ""sterilizing immunity"". likely virus replicating mouth/nose infection taking hold due vaccine. first shot astrazeneca second pfizer ... likely new variants kicking in. heard recent pollings French got way enthusiastic vaccinations.  Dr. Barron: Yes, likely get one version mRNA vaccine safe get another mRNA vaccine regardless manufacturer vaccine. ongoing studies looking receipt mRNA vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna) vector-based vaccine (J&amp;J, Astra-Zeneca) whether better two mRNA vaccines. information hopefully available summer.  Wow. timeline me. meaning start following Spotify. Never could remember get around it. Kept reading bullshit, pal-ing around Alex Jones, think I‚Äôm done. fun lasted. helping w/ asthma &amp; allergies immensely, I'll keep wearing mask that. US vaccinated 240M people already according Reddit wear masks? cares much people think come care mass media think him? Messaging CDC overly cautious opinion. still recommend vaccinated people go indoor restaurants bars, go maskless crowds outdoors, attend large indoor gatherings. case vaccines highly effective? young people low risk covid, encouraging vaccine skepticism? needs change order public health guidance state vaccinated people able resume 100% pre-covid lives? Headlines today subtly suggest ‚Äúdemand waning‚Äù, ultimately turn ‚Äúthe reason cant go back normal neighbor. pressure them.‚Äù Get flue shot every year, health insurance would cover it? Initial stockpiles produced EU went UK. Anyway EU doesn‚Äôt care that, cares Astra filling contract huge margin receiving lot money subsidies EU. production never gonna viable that‚Äôs clear breach contract. Astra deals problem, EU doesn‚Äôt anything UK enoug different perspective. Every single one friends vaccinated, close family vaccinated, coworkers vaccinated. never question if, question get soon possible. 

So areas/groups different. Decent. great. Also expensive difficult manufacture. I've never fan mention spotify you? wondering there's something spotify, change naritive spotify, got ""bigger"" spotify? 

Either way, stay safe help others safe. I'm really scared blood clotting stuff: got Sinopharm 2 days ago, I'm scared shitless I'm developing clots. strictly vector vaccines? older tech like Sino? 25/M, risk? I'll take over-reaction inadequate reaction. Every time.

I arguing overreaction underreaction, though. arguing people CDC shouldn‚Äôt try sociologists give recommendations based data, manipulating hate dipshit made hay making COVID political thing. isn't. freedom thing, rugged individualism thing. death least now, see clearly wore signs proclaiming it, selfishness stupidity walks among us. could done shit long time ago. people listen scientists dragging fucker out.

I agree this. Come Georgia think true. I'm sure alone. People dumb. pandemic end due abundance caution. Dumb people gun-ho relaxing end extending whole thing. 

I'd listen medical professionals idiotic annoyance. Straw man argument. Medical experts never claimed masks stop spread, reduce spread. entire point. Distancing doesn‚Äôt much anything. Barriers literally nothing all. Neither constantly wiping things down.

What matters ventilation. Opening windows running fans would way protect people.

I‚Äôm saying eating indoors unvaccinated good idea, isn‚Äôt. plexiglass barriers aren‚Äôt shit. Dr. Zane: point out, 142 million people vaccinated nary side-effect consequence. mechanism mRNA vaccine zero mechanism flu vaccine. Also, 1976 flu vaccine seriously flawed recognized so. nah, analogy pretty shit, trying say masks permanent there‚Äôs level risk never go away? China literally thing vaccines don‚Äôt see anyone voicing concerns it. I'm trying change anyone's mind, blown away fact everyone assumes COVID vaccine means never catch COVID. manufacturers vaccines say prevents serious illness, that's much reading people apparently. think trouble mindset treats opinions equally worthy put spotlight sake ""open dialogue,"" opinions *informed opinions* opinions fringe conspiracy theories.

And fringe conspiracy theories getting mainstream precisely websites lack guts clamp misinformation.

Some teenager hears Alex Jones ranting Joe Rogan's podcast maybe teenager radicalized simply Joe Rogan challenge word Jones confidently ranting about.

Handing microphone extremists ""open dialogue."" Given alternative isolating 2 weeks regardless everyone going choose PCR. There's reason to. Cases started dropping lot mid-January, doubt added 10% 2021.

The thing waning protection many people got virus early pandemic. represent significant amount people well. Dr. Barron: side effect profile quite variable person person. anecdotal reports COVID-19 previously, might pronounced side effects clear lessen side effects second shot. still worth getting natural infection may protective variant strains COVID-19 vaccine seems quite protective. What's recommendation around newborn, vaccinated unvaccinated? advice OB seems inconsistent, evolving new data.     waiting Elon Musk jump Rogan's defense Twitter... you‚Äôre spreading misinformation, i‚Äôm glad seemingly nobody paying serious consideration. obvious point time hard differentiate, that‚Äôs thought never going see eye eye Good misinformation. Originally clinical trials studied contraction COVID-19 symptoms, spread explicitly studied. asked could take mask of, etc, etc. officials respond ""we know vaccine stops symptoms, *we know* stops spread."" got twisted media ""the vaccines *don't* stop spread! PANIC!!""

Of course reasonable assume vaccines stop spread that's kinda point vaccine, course *now* studies show vastly diminished transmission rate vaccinated people, bad information already out.

Of course swap spit person immediately turn around swap spit person B spread it? Sure, guess counts, ... swap spit strangers? think mask gonna help scenario.  reason believe figures one month on. One complication cross contamination likely actual positive cases, less likely true positives. There's difference credibility influential power. One based evidence solely based popularity. idiots like Gwyneth Paltrow 0 credibility tremendous influential power sucker idiots.

Having followers automatically give credibility either otherwise Kim Kardashian one smartest scientists world lol you‚Äôre getting information Joe Rogan, it‚Äôs great idea. far entertainment value? Great show. EU absolute farce towards UK throughout whole vaccine process.

Every single time dragged UK spats. That's job ? fair admitted many times know shit idiot people listen him. hand he's told Eddie Bravo plenty times platform responsible say. People take medical advice Anthony Fauci ridiculous well post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* realize knee-jerk reaction includes ‚Äúbitching CNN‚Äù says know, right? People compromised immune systems free get vaccinated months US. it‚Äôs effective nothing worry about. actually true Rogan HGH T? (I listen pictures I've seen looks like leather-human) According rising, India's sequencing bit spotty graph may reflective nation's actual situation. anti-maskers vaccinated, nothing. job done isn‚Äôt it?

If aren‚Äôt vaccinated, well hey, rules mask still exist them. don‚Äôt abide get mean looks public considering there‚Äôs enforcement anyways (Though be). 
Punishing anti-vax might better way promote vaccines telling people even they‚Äôre fully vaccinated must mask up. speculate, guess prefer silence groups disagree with, case, rather allow discussion based objective facts.

CDC released data recently saying 28000 deaths far US solely covid. remaining 500+k deaths co morbidities, 80% deaths 4-5! Living unhealthy kill you, covid. 99+% people simple common cold. need wake up. CURRENT situation wasted whole year basically amount deaths previous years. massive religious festival millions attendees - actually pushed schedule next year year.

Modi working Former US Leader/Current Brazil Leader playbook nothing.

Pandemic fatigue set in.

During political races candidates welcomed encouraged large gatherings.

Plus variant spreads quicker caught fire wrong time. Thanks. I'm vaccinated people know too. worries seeing first doses declining. need this. Thanks Jen :-) Thanks Dr. Zane. However, specifically mention demand-side two questions, focused Vaccine Administration Rate specifically address demand side things. issue, experience, real supply, logistics appointment handling. 

Can clarify answer please? Exactly. Yeah also kinda weird include people fall already Corona. There's likely lot confusion people make wrong assumption.

I'm US recently corona (already recovered). government says even need two vaccinations anymore. One enough provided get within six months testing positive. also said likely get anymore either (assuming mean next 6 months) without symptoms spread it.

Kinda sucks much info online contradicting, I'll make guess assume still fall left category. Dr. Zane: Although possible, unlikely related vaccine.  Citation needed  someone help break data me?

I impression mRNA vaccines \~94% effective preventing symptomatic infection.

So vaccine 94% effective preventing hospitalization 65+ y/o's, would means 6% vaccinated people ended hospitalized?

Or 6% already *infected* vaccinated people?

Forgive me, statistics strong suit! since changed viewpoint mask effectiveness new info learned virus transmitted.

Thats science works guy. said world flat that's longer valid.

You need new line cuz 'fauci wrong' old news Brainwashed what? Thinking masks prevent COVID? Thanks insight perspective! fuck point shot everyone stay masked up? want continue indefinitely? wrong IMO. taken 2020 make obvious retrospect. Unfortunately Joe like much America people given platform based success start thinking shit stink.  long answer?

One month results, what?

Imo far many people vax us kinds stats pray tell, anti-mask contingent large enough prevent herd immunity success? Dr. Zane: Yes, COVID, first shot may behave second shot COVID. got mine time, curious! Thanks! COVID like first shot taught immune system look for. first shot acted like second shot triggered strong immune reaction increases body‚Äôs defense. Joeth Pal*bro*! sure Russia. chinese CDC chief said chinese vaccine less effective compared vaccines? also read China going approve Pfizer June.

Disinformation looks different me.   Nah, brainwashed bit far. well i‚Äôm glad smug guy internet made condescending comment, that‚Äôll surely change peoples‚Äôs minds    Definitely testosterone, hide it. He's 50s prescribed. know HGH doubt based I've heard him. sure elk meat dmt though lol. Dr. Zane: believe types boosters become available. 95% efficacy doesn‚Äôt mean 5% chance getting COVID. actual incidence something like 0.04%. Yeah he's sunk cost, mean Spotify can't use sunk cost fallacy supporting commit sunk cost fallacy continue behavior endeavor result previously invested resources (time, money effort) (Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985). ... example, individuals sometimes order much food over-eat ‚Äúget money's worth‚Äù.

You proved point sunk cost fallacy statement one Spotify losing sleep watch revenue increase podcast. paid platform, sure damn well gonna let generate revenue. didn't. One German newspaper did.

And EU steal anything. Unless consider uk's export ban corona medicines stealing, too? Compliance weeks hard lockdowns March early April would reduced cases tenfold saved least 80k-100k lives. first months pandemic know enough care patients *and* hospitals unprepared volume patients, higher percentage severe cases ended death. Look growth cases places ""hard"" lockdowns actually enforced (not islands; look India April &amp; May 2020 1.3 billion people together almost 10x fewer cases US) see that, least ""if adherence recommendations significantly higher, worst parts pandemic..."" would least significantly reduced.

Separately lockdowns, multiple researchers (some simulations, also looking places compliance actually high) shown 80% population consistently wears masks properly practices reasonable social distancing (literally left column new chart; stuff red, try avoid stuff yellow, always wear mask contact people outside household) R0 drops well 1 cases grow geometrically like last year‚Äîthey drop sharply.

Furthermore, adding effective contact tracing (and associated quarantining &amp; testing) make even bigger difference *real* appropriate response ""a cases popping up"". asian countries managed keep cases extremely low even without lockdowns ""harsh"" restrictions like shutting indoor dining ubiquitous thorough contact tracing. person tests positive, everyone they've come contact (even public settings like restaurants) gets quarantined &amp; tested, along subsequent contact networks exposed people, outbreaks stopped tracks. US (and much western world), lot makes effective contact tracing possible resisted rejected name privacy personal freedoms. keep wearing mask fucking hard Chile cases dropping slightly last days. really really hope trend continues. I'm getting second Sinovac dose tomorrow morning, fact. Dr. Barron: Newborns vulnerable infections due immature developing immune system get infected COVID-19. generally recommended protective measures used keep baby healthy, include vaccination COVID-19 pertussis, flu, etc. measures hand hygiene masking also important prevent transmission. end day, comes comfort parents feel appropriate. I'm sure Joe would tell us get excersize instead. Hospitalization death? Weren‚Äôt vaccines 100% effective two things ? necessarily. immunocompromised certainly protected vaccination, it‚Äôs still possible immune systems weakened general, there‚Äôs chance won‚Äôt able mount enough response completely ward COVID. We‚Äôll know lot coming weeks monitored. People idiots. maybe younger demographic things seem really black white. like someone nothing person possibly good, like someone person shits gold. vaccine isn‚Äôt silver bullet cure Covid never touted such. simply provides better protection when/if contract virus. people protection less chance variants mutate protection well less chance virus spread general. still spread? course, given sample size enough people spread outcomes far less deadly currently are. someone baby brain would make argument cures stops Covid 100%.

Also, source data CDC says 280k people died Covid can‚Äôt seem find anywhere. argument making literally like shooting you, bad heart heart attack, die. say heart attack didn‚Äôt murder there‚Äôs way something make underlying issue worse. wouldn‚Äôt died right didn‚Äôt shoot you, idiot. possibility mutation could become different intial strain renders current vaccines useless? God Joe fucking stupid, boggles mind Haha üíØ share studies? SIREN study going UK show increase reinfection B.1.1.7 variant. Rectally seen South Park, oil whole cooked chicken shove ass. majority 50%. think it‚Äôs quite clear scientists shouldn‚Äôt talking directly journalists public. They‚Äôre beyond terrible it.

Frankly, they‚Äôre quite bad policy side well. won‚Äôt say anything without getting information first. That‚Äôs fine you‚Äôre research, you‚Äôre decision maker fast moving crisis, decision worse sub optimal one. did? Look I'm means anti-masker, wear pretty much day everyday. Holy fuck depressing look at, end? didn‚Äôt say that. taking poor old grandmas vaccine Dr. Kutner: Pfizer submitted request FDA approval 12 - 15 year olds. expected hear decision next couple months. FDA issues EUA (emergency use authorization), become available Colorado well. happy hear positive experience UCHealth. able address special needs individuals vaccine clinics. there‚Äôs obvious indication whether someone vaccinated unfortunately need assume you‚Äôre dumbass refuse choose follow precautions, least perspective businesses similar. WHAT, Joe Rogan wrong something? indeed newsworthy. thought one better research logic him... Coincidentally thing getting vaccine. think we‚Äôre averaging 700s per day, remember 8000 people die US every day COVID.

There certain number COVID deaths overlap, really looking CDC excess deaths, total numbers lag 8 weeks behind.  one knew true magnitude shit Trump

Plenty people ignored it. terrible, revisionist history. again, seriously expect people wear masks indefinitely? end sight new way life? step right direction example: 1000 people get placebo 1000 get vaccine. placebo group, 100 hospitalized covid. vaccine group, 6 hospitalized covid. Thus, 94% less hospitalizations vaccinated group. study assume sample consists people infected covid.  Barcelona agree. And, according CDC's latest studies ""Mask Mandates"" reduce **growth** cases, compared mask mandates, 0.5% first 20 days mandate initiated. tops 1.8% reduction case growth. Notice said ""growth"" case total. 

Source: [Association State-Issued Mask Mandates Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining County-Level COVID-19 Case Death Growth Rates  anecdotally confirm, 28F sickest remember adult. 101 fever, chills, worst body aches I‚Äôve ever had, headache, random organ inflammation think (I distinctly feel kidneys something else lower left abdomen tender). also gonna sound stupid, but...my hair hurts. Assuming scalp sensitivity? Idk even Tylenol making bearable 12/10 would again. I‚Äôm grateful woods never covid. hopefully Canada follows shortly approves well.  unvaccinated people lie vaccinated get sick that's problem mine. lot people think would get vaccinated told could ditch mask afterwards. stores restaurants able enforce it, workplace spend 40+ hours per week can. got first vaccine already, would heck lot enthusiastic getting employer told wear mask work anymore getting fully vaccinated. ""logic"" ""logic"", ""common sense"" matter, useless crap applied area know enough about. think know know invariably there's way it.

The reliable way know shit multiple independent people test hypotheses scientifically.

Have ever seen dense cotton cloth electron microscope? No.

So hell know weave tight enough? don't.

Maybe there's lots fuzz threads catch viruses. Maybe matter threads virus run holes. Maybe there's weird electrostatic shit going somehow captures particles floating around. There's probably things can't even imagine work.

I mean, logic told people earth center universe, so...

People believe kinds insane shit. also sometimes reality way wackier would imagine. 

The reliable way add knowledge science: mindset, methods, experiments, communities, on.

""Common sense"" get us transistors--the weirdness quantum mechanics did. There'd internet spread anti-science horse puckey science. kinda thousands dying every day ppl taking precautions. harm good lol already forced vaccinate schools colleges requiring students vaccinated seem crazy.  Yeah someone never listened JRE day life. taking something know nothing about? derail this, brain fog one effects people Long Covid struggling extensively. wife dealing year :( brutal. great. relieved folks got vaccinated. don‚Äôt know getting vaccinated couldn‚Äôt impair natural immunity. don‚Äôt data yet. 

Most importantly yet data showing getting vaccinated would improve immunity already have. both? Oh, sure. state doesn‚Äôt really see much regular travel, live place like New York, would really need worried herd immunity levels like states commuting range We'll always Biogen. No, Pfizer sent us actually. believe 

1. effect wears time. Covid March 2020 July minimal antibodies.

2. variants addressed It‚Äôs far considering Sauna use actually positive effect immune system... restaurants closing 5pm!? live Spain close 23h curfew end soon cases spike, vaccines working great here.  primary cause lot people distrusting enough ignore entirely, terrible strategy ... people trial protected Covid-19 bad boss might contributed ending hospital. sure UK would willing Germany politicians spreading bullshit stats AZ well French president saying AZ 'quasi-effective' EU stolen shipment Australia?  need lockdown vending machines ASAP lol Got 2nd dose pfizer minutes ago!! Can't wait lick doorknobs üí¶ suspect suspicion cast Russian vaccines Russophobia actual evidence unsafe.

Orrrrrrrrrr... 

Russia much vocal vaccines superior brought lot attention compared China.  I'm losing patience CDC bullshit. Misinforming people order keep things restricted, noble attempt getting vaccinated, aggravating. people talk think vaccines less effective actually result. respect people know need need virus know it'll affect them. Sure chances severe symptoms low younger people. mean happen. Certainly people social media says like ""it's like 99% recovery rate serious symptoms"" number much higher total population anyone works hospital come across people commonly anyone expects.

It's damning thing young healthcare workers end dead despite risk comorbidity. seen anyone voicing concerns China‚Äôs vaccines subreddit

Uhhh spent lot time subreddit  medical professionals continuously misled us start pandemic messaging. ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt anything‚Äù. Failure show vaccines curb spread. goes on. still trust wholeheartedly, don‚Äôt know say bro shouldn't, opinion Indian politicians irrational pride, name better combo assume worried flu. family members risk. issue hits close home. care effected it. thats good you."
