0,2021-07-20,"  read study? took samples experiments labs. representative real life. now, real world studies show J&amp;J effective delta. realise world live restrictions last year half, Australia normality outside short lockdowns? Arkansas resident here. insane. much said it. regional perspective, major cities England seriously lagging, whereas rural areas propping up. Complete opposite fair, Pfizer skin game. course want people take annual boosters. take 95-60? That's works. Otherwise 100% decrease would make -5%, rather actual 0%. goal eradicate COVID? reasoning CDC seems line remember comments articles agreed upon months ago - goal vaccines prevent severe cases drastically curb mortality. lucky, remember saying, it'd also great job curbing spread among infected. 

Right now, focus shifted case positives little focus efficacy reducing severe cases among vaccinated. think constantly focusing case #'s terrible idea horrible optics. worst kind messaging makes things seem hopeless even mask got vaccinated. I've fully vaccinated months I'm beginning feel never end. 

If look messaging logically rationally, believe I'm right - they're saying variants might lead positive cases vaccinated, return mask mandates, distancing, even lockdowns. 

And that's case things always place never stop variants. Even every human U.S. vaccinated tomorrow, literally BILLIONS hosts elsewhere. 100% focus, especially now, whether reducing severe cases death among vaccinated.

If variants biggest concern, literally every person earth willing get shot problem getting one asap. stop worrying people refuse Missouri start worrying people elsewhere would get heartbeat available. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm gonna blast. death toll 19 people yesterday, calm down. last time many cases today, daily death toll around 1400. They'll fine. mean, year. Either desensitize go fucking crazy. look without hearing goosebumps theme. Second dose + 2 weeks today!

Still happily wearing mask keeping distance: thing ain't long shot.  Sounds like unvaccinated, unmasked person infected unmasked people group proves point. It‚Äôs actually bad seems. underestimate many hospital staff don‚Äôt medical degree. talking receptionists, janitors, cafeteria workers, people take temperature give mask entrance ect. people much lower vaccine uptake, bringing numbers. Still really bad, quite bad numbers suggest. Ok, would office full people mild covid symptoms help? would make feel like shit make less productive. severe mean sickness ENSEMBLE ENSEMBLE 2 trials ones watch data think. Since well understood, would require ongoing trials FDA approval. comes initial vaccines gain full FDA approval, looks months away.

ah know holding rolling vaccines variants. 

but yeah agree rest posted, hope too. Really hope FDA approval comes quick practicable. Man sucks. I'd call nurse see help. Usually offices line ask nurses questions. mean I'm doctor I'd hate someone take random advice internet dont *think* much hard collecting different vaccines. Havent articles recently saying mix march (ie one pfizer one moderna) acceptable? That's drop last week, improvement. Sigh.. go again.. ok raise let's say survival rate even higher 99.5%.. tiny 0.5% deaths. Assuming global population around 8 billion, woruld imply death count around 40,000,000.

What's scary perfectly healthy people succumb die within days

So get fucking vaccinated. Wear g damn masks try live normal life possible hopefully reach herd immunity eventually. There's way still need higher uptake though. good, still enough. clarify, general, immune compromised people get vaccinated, bodies may mount effective even immune response, leaves still vulnerable virus. People anaphylaxis specific vaccine ingredients ones can‚Äôt get vaccinated (although countries vaccines ones different ingredients hopefully take one elaborate thought appropriate 3 months?  room medical religious exemptions, course. Best analogy I've read. vaccinated, risk low really would prefer wait appointment four months Construction workers experience though far worst mask wearers. yeah, make much sense closed, non-essential retail. spike protein allows virus bond human cells, mutates much evade vaccine, it‚Äôs quite likely longer remains threat us. Mask prevent spread virus others. asked doctor?  friend works hospital. Staff aren‚Äôt vaccinated exposures many times work gets paid time needs find replacement off. She‚Äôs ready vaccination enforced get let go. Must nice (American)  get vaccinated Moderna got J&amp;J already. study saying 33% efficacy delta spooks care vaccinated people, thought common knowledge still host even vaccines. world would anyone want covid even vaccinated since know fast spreads. crazyness. literally shit taught grade school bug spread flu season agree, I‚Äôm saying objective fact discussion mRNA immunity ability avoid catching/spreading Covid huge part sub literally months. things proved less true reality, including vaccinated people turning spread covid still, people pretending never anything hospitalization vaccines touted for. absolutely advertised excitedly talked vectors immunity. Also likely got infected getting vaccine, incubation period start show symptoms. don‚Äôt legally think full FDA approval tell anyone listen, sister law literally everyone job got Covid *while* wearing masks, they‚Äôre magical germ proof shields. helpful had, vaccines way this.  Assuming % hospitalizations deaths vaccinated people higher cases many cases simply go unnoticed vaccinated people they‚Äôre asymptotic True, that's case, there's also argument worried vaccinating percentage world population quickly possible - literally getting shots anywhere people accept asap putting arm - rather concentrating begging relatively small pockets people get shot know never will. Imprtant realize mRNA technology quite versatile - they're looking using flu vaccines too.

So making one different coronavirus likely quite straightforward.

Even one, given past development technique, development actual vaccine matter days weeks; testing quantity manufacturing sorting logistics took time.

Knowing know steps could even faster last year's precedent-shatterimg speed face new emergency need. fair, doctors vaccine specialists recall reading mRNA vaccines (simplifying here) bit like Lego sets. Plug play. well understood Pfizer/BionTech Moderna say tackle new variants within weeks billions doses within couple months ramp there. would be, iirc, vaccine would cover known variants time manufacture.

Since well understood, would require ongoing trials FDA approval. comes initial vaccines gain full FDA approval, looks months away.

In end, would become much like flu shot, adjusted every year whichever strain circulating.

If truly get point see mandatory vaccinations globally make difficult avoid vaccinated.

We may year that, sure hope happens. Anything put (mostly) behind us.

With Covid circulating among people refuse, among many animals interact with, likely parade new variants decades. Hopefully mRNA tech help us get this.  Except still need vaccines Hopefully.
pressure mounting  rubbish mate.
it's normal life living restrictions drop hat unable travel overseas country   Another American Glasgow area - fully vaccinated, still quarantine return? quarantined last November pretty miserable.  Washington state 57% population fully vaccinated though Northwestern counties high 60% range. I‚Äôm choosing believe you‚Äôre trolling me. use ‚Äúon holiday‚Äù something Texan would ever say. Well, glad slipped relieved anxiety post caused. People quick discredit vaccines ways like surprised people don‚Äôt get vaccinated. Cool. thoughtless logic again. Usually people's athletic primes lasts two Olympic cycles hopefully 2024 better Yes, that's got. pay too. get it. really want convince otherwise must address points. compassion (this important).

Even post, belittle view points numerous occasions. Lockdowns extremely nuanced topic ""objective answer"". Even immunologist cannot give ""right"" answer comes lockdowns. tell informed advice minimize spread, that's it. question lock *must* holistic one. minimizing spread goal, one able leave houses ever (and that's also respiratory viruses like flu). Obviously, think agree that's little extreme. answer somewhere middle, must take account economy, mental health population, etc.

You may cope well lockdowns, others may dare say, feeble people's mental state (ie ""I need party!"").

I aunt lives alone severely affected (mentally) lockdowns. process trying make friends whole thing made almost impossible her. really struggled past year. really think justified simply say ""feeble minded""?

Anyways, enough rambling me. I'm sure mean well this, think important able disagree civilized compassionate way. Nah, hospitalizations deaths since least J&amp;J shot approved people talking rejecting favor mRNA shots J&amp;J much lower immunity percentage. 

J&amp;J determined equally effective (99%) mRNA preventing serious illness leading hospitalization death, since avoiding deaths overloaded hospitals *true* goal, take whichever vaccine offered. Sorry hear.

Canada done procuring doses next week. Hopefully send way! Congrats! mandate never enforced authorities either figured administer darts, smooth sailing. Scottish Government could go advice quickly set advisory committee. list variants fun delta First report said best vs delta. worst. Screw everyone fun delta German efficiency complete myth. reason opened adults comparatively early rollout become mess worth pretending restricted anymore.

And get vaccine pass, bring yellow book get validated pharmacy since recorded electronically vaccinated.

Read Berlin Brandenburg Airport even worse example. late undo damage stupid FoxNews human üí©üöΩ  much better option slowing spread vaccine mandates and/or passports.

It effective ‚Äúfair.‚Äù think realize society part one  still shocks seeing people say live Norwalk, people I‚Äôve seen local Norwalk / Santa Fe Springs / Downey area stores continued wearing masks since original mandate dropped (it sometimes felt like one people wearing mask). local Stater Bros usually less employees masks customers. couple times I‚Äôve gone since weekend, everyone I‚Äôve seen masked. That's true. injure lot people accidentally car accident one mistake. hope everyone else seat belts on. car outside.

It dangerous. contagious. developed countries, becoming benign vulnerable elderly highly vaccinated. pandemic unvaccinated point.   places get upset wear mask, doctor's office? I'd frustrated situation. Idk people can't wrap heads around fact doctor's office place sick people higher risk covid/getting sick covid tend congregate.  got Covid March 2020 JJ March 2021. JJ actually gave worse symptoms Covid (although much shorter lasting). Wondering do. That's true, generally indicates little difference two groups results overlap 12 testing started March six month data gathered September testing works approval come late fall. I‚Äôm American. Grew Texas. bestie UK probably pick words phrases. got vax L.A. feel like getting sick every month? Sorry see common cold flu, highly contagious get multiple times THERES REASON STOP SPREADING. want keep getting sick covid wearing mask? fucking don't, seems horrible even vaccine I'm starting lose track politics anything disease/mask/vaccine live US. seems like two zero connection yet saw scatterplot Twitter every county's vax rate one axis Trump voter percentage axis appeared clear linear regression going on. higher Trump vote %, lower full vax %. Coincidence? use words ‚Äúon holiday‚Äù I‚Äôm going assume you‚Äôre British? get J&amp;J? Sorry trying nitpick I‚Äôve never heard American use phrase. UK data state opposite, regardless that, single AZ dose better efficacy single Pfizer dose original trials well? 

And btw, we're mostly talking two doses thread. Ya bewildering people risk due profession yet fail take precautionary measures drastically reduce risk themselves. think mask mandates travel restrictions many countries outside US pretty much stay rest year. Iceland population vaxxed still requiring vaxxed travelers test entry. would shocked ""open"" European countries get stricter Fall/Winter approaches. US pretty much going back stricter protocols.  yet plenty countries huge outbreaks despite mask mandates. thing I'm impressed good UK testing is, considering bad early 2020 (I London, time). Literally impossible get test now, effectively impossible get one. see policy helps anyone.

The logic would flight caps number people overseas struggling get home. restricting people leaving adding problem. Turns number people trying return home stays roughly even though hundreds thousands already returned. number people leaving exemptions seems reached kind equilibrium flight caps.  Vaccination rates tell different story. many anti vaxxers here, few/no politicians news organizations pushing anti vax sentiment, can't said states. It‚Äôll good case study. US, pretty much over...some regions might suggest/implement masks Winter strict many people listen care. Businesses going shut it'll based individual choice (ie: singer feels uncomfortable, might cancel show). 

&amp;#x200B;

If cases US rise, countries might tighten bans/restrictions us entering. example, might need get test enter, quarantine, test 5th day even vaxxed...or least, test entry. see travel opening year way resembling 2019. probably wait till 2022 things open globally more. European countries open get tighter Fall approaches (whether makes sense not). ran slider way-for last 14 days data saw saw. think, however, number medically frail people infinite immune escape apocalyptic scope.   sure hope so. issue letting antivaxxers get immunised hard way. give everyone chance vaccinated first, means kids too. going die clog hospitals, still high risk Long Covid ethically let exposed. mean, suppose true. noticed increasing amount middle-aged Republicans around actually becoming fearful delta variant appear willing get vaccinated now. 

Sadly, it‚Äôs young adult Republican crowd seems resistant getting vaccine. Wouldn‚Äôt bet yet, full reopening likely drive case increases. I'm Australia, we're barely double digits. Send us leftover doses, thanks. work allow people go back site completely voluntarily. Somebody building tested positive back home  cases, remember no. Majority hospitalizations yes, reasons describe. right. people making personal decisions put body, ends impacting us all. enough selfish people. Well... people scared vaccines now. know viral (or bacterial case be) mediated illnesses are? asking question. Sorry! Australia New Zealand started mass vaccination campaigns yet, still well behind autumn. I'm hoping catch pass US December though. I‚Äôm also CA. got instructions today. worry (fully vaxxed) teen autistic I‚Äôm sure stand wear one full day. We‚Äôre gonna give shot I‚Äôm thinking might homeschooling can‚Äôt. Illinois lottery. suicides, businesses closing, people losing homes, people unable see family even dying. 


Do think would infinitely worse borders shut continuous restrictions state premiers lost minds

Yeah, like Gladys letting Delta get whole country. Dutch Reform Amish follow? Yeah, point, shocked see another lockdown US. think mask mandates winter higher possibility things stay open, warning vulnerable people stay home careful maybe. could see certain countries implementing tighter travel restrictions airlines canceling flights Fall/Winter though. unpopular admit here, China's dystopian proficiency contact tracing, surveillance, swift resolute ability curtail people's mobility full display throughout pandemic. They've able effectively control virus use technology authority probably even possible 10 years ago. 
It really impressive, think mean good way. Crazy Australia convinced people Zero COVID attainable.

Australia able convince people zero Covid achievable successfully achieved reducing outbreaks zero numerous times. 

If say ""zero Covid"" means re-introductions completely invalidate approach completely misunderstand trying achieved. ""Zero Covid"" Australia never meant absolute permanent elimination Covid Australia. means accepted cannot maintain baseline level infections community without number cases exploding requiring control measures. accept control measures necessary faster earlier implemented effective result shorter lockdowns less infections overall.

Remember like 10% fully vaccinated. I'd prefer lockdown early + low deaths rather lockdown late + high deaths. Totally true. since imaginary alternate history scenario anyways, we're free imagine different president charge.

If anyone needs inspiration have
[The 10 Best Movie Presidents Freeman President Beck might good pick.  work. Large manufacturing facility rural NC. two vaccination events early (March/April timeframe). 

We sitting around 35% vaccination rate. Pretty much line county. Parents get vaccinated much higher risks children. parent gets sick kid sympathy them, however think kids deserve live normal life considering risk low. Christian Scientists Dutch Reform though avoiding vaccination absolute either them. purposely obtuse. sounds like focused survey long covid support groups seems probable continue symptoms would far likely respond don't. result, would take 91% number grain salt. another data point, SARS-COV-1 survivors local region Hong Kong surveyed found 40% experiencing symptoms four years. So, 90%, may still high long system may looking long road recovery ever fully recover all. feel like getting sick every month?

Well good thing breakthrough infections pretty rare, happen. got numbers look pretty close Tuesday, DPH reported 1,649 new positive COVID-19 cases July 10 July analyzing number overall COVID-19 cases reported DPH July 10 July 16, breakthrough cases account 43.4 percent new COVID-19 cases. Yup. Denial/cognitive dissonance coping mechanism can't handle adversity reality. matter sick they've get never admit might covid. ""my allergies"" etc. Even dying vents still accuse doctors nurses ""secretly killing flu."" üôÑ God hope happens. might strep. read reports nurses doctors get verbally abused schmucks lay dying Covid realize nothing reach fanatics. handled like everywhere. Science matter opinion treated such. Delta variant rips Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, rest United States, may see vaccination numbers start rise tandem. drop cases dampened people‚Äôs urge get vaccinated, perhaps surge cases opposite. ICUs keep filling up, COVID-19 deaths increase again, growing sense danger may envelop among vaccine-hesitant, nudging toward action. It‚Äôs pattern we‚Äôve seen before: 2019, measles struck parts Pacific Northwest, local rates measles vaccination tripled response. economist Emily Oster looked pertussis outbreaks, county county, going back 1991, found child vaccination rates increased years followed. two? makes feel better exposed length symptomatic COVID carrier work, masks, tested negative afterward. idea COVID time, told later week alerted part contact tracing. vaccine works ü§åüèª Delta Vega bust trying day find test husband.

Unless Murphy commits major gaffe, can't see Cittarelli beating him. Usually virus infectious disease survival rate comes hand hand. stating fact.

Also everything think two outcomes? comparison AZ disingenuous highly misleading. Across board previous variants, ONE dose J&amp;J equal TWO doses AZ. Look one dose efficacy numbers Pfizer AZ B.1.351 (S African variant). One dose J&amp;J still 64% one. reads like someone almost intentionally misrepresenting parallels. definitely true. I'm Canadian, there's fairly sizeable number antivaxxers main Canadian subs. number people I've encountered IRL vehemently antivaxxers is, mercifully, pretty low. them, ratio way less U.S.  It‚Äôs already spread like wildfire. cases keep going exponentially.  Trump office Biden better job? thread ^. It‚Äôs Twitter take w grain salt people pretty reputable throughout pandemic (Nate silver etc.) actually seeing HIT 85%, sure got 98% number illl keep looking Monmouth County here, almost masks worn.  mean, beta variant pretty old point well studied. 

The beta variant evades vaccine better variant. However, much less easily spread Delta, extent uncertain would even outcompete Delta everyone vaccinated. 

France's spike due Delta.  Reality set businesses eventually, they'll realize vast profits continue made people continue isolate bare minimum outside homes. start vaccination mandates pure avarice motivation. even relevant? talking about? arrested, held tested, fined heavily, maybe time. think let intimidate us more. get worse. one blaming small fraction people can‚Äôt vaccinated health reasons. It‚Äôs people actively refusing vaccine putting whatever reason. 

Good luck family.  Research show wearing mask pretty good job protecting wearer, plus good job protecting others wearer carrier COVID-19. burn alive!!! üòò 99% survival rate  42% NJ voted trump.

Kinda thoughts too, unless things really take turn worse know making anti-vaxxers arguments comments like this, you? anti-vaxxer yourself?

Stop cherry-picking data look big picture. Arkansas? Sure, distracted drinking driving does. ways irresponsible wearing seat belt.

The unvaccinated almost entirely hurting love. sad, let adults make dumb choices Yep I'm you. I've waiting hear link asymptomatic infections vs ""long"" covid. Either studies missed them. 

While I'm vaccinated really want risk getting sick even symptoms mild could still long-term damage done. Pay do, restrict don't? young, healthy, fully vaccinated definitely time start living life again.

Hell, really even young healthy point vaccinated. long elderly severely ill kind underlying condition, feel pretty comfortable living normal life. yikes Phish opens tour 8 days  could mistaken, heard tests really reliable comes back positive, meaning false negatives much common false positives. test negative, still recommend getting PCR test. 2 percent figure might people actually get sick vaccination ones likely die disease vaxxed. Think people HIV reduced immunity

Considering we're talking handful people multi-million person state several months, makes complete sense, considering vaccination concretely known less effective immunocompromised people. Doctors suggested 3 doses cases. That's floored employers behaving - liability risks bonehead.

""Uhhh, none."" Paywalled me, I'm assuming study?

Comparison Neutralizing Antibody Titers Elicited mRNA Adenoviral Vector Vaccine SARS-CoV-2 gas pressure without container yes no? many dead children consider large number?

I 5 weeks last week, two locally transmitted cases despite population density. robust testing. 1 local transmitted case caused mandatory testing like 20+ apartment blocks (like 30 floors high blocks). Eh, wonder possible Overton Window sling shot back.

I doubt it, exponential inertia nightmare slow down, let alone stop altogether Pfizer offered us enough doses, government take seriously, vaccine rollout suffered. Prime Minister massive salesman, absolutely terrible leader. becomes mandatory enter airports, trains, etc

France made even stricter restrictions. prove entirely vaccinated covid PCR test (but expensive) enter malls, airports, cinemas, museums, bars, restaurants, gyms... every enclosed space welcoming 50 people (apart public transportation). first day speech : 900.000 people took appointment get vaccinated. pressure works. That's sad. zero covid attainable without vaccines.

most across public holidays school holidays.

Melbourne spent 250 odd days lockdown last year.


20 million australians currently lockdown across Australia put 25 million 

we currently 200 cases.

So, county it, hospitals full people don‚Äôt believe jack shit except Jesus Trump. going back masks prove point vaccines don‚Äôt work blah, blah, blah.

Right now, lot people empathy knob turned never touched, selfish knob turned way up. Funny part is, people got ideas (Trump, Fox News etc), gotten vaccinated. even public record.

And they'll keep doubling till virus kills them, solving bit overpopulation problem time raising median IQ mankind. get facts here! deal scientific emotions sub. Around 100 cases per day present. 6 8 weeks more, worse.

At least misdemeanor could arrested for. fully vaccinated breakthrough deaths data yet? age? comorb's? ‚ÄúValidation carries weight education.‚Äù

This brilliant. sad true. agree you. Stay safe. Many teachers leaving jobs. Near me, shortages. going provide safe environment work see leaving. right, it? safe work? bit, yes. Looking strictly fully-vaccinated individuals, metro area 57.0% (1.35M fully vaccinated), rest state 46.1% (1.36M fully vaccinated), rest state minus Olmsted 45.1% (1.3M fully vaccinated).

Okay, sort second wave corona nearly bad spanish flu... going decades. even difficult break conservative bubble internet.  Seriously, plans move need employment. Maybe time it. NZ MIQ system lot problems months ago, made many improvements since considered gold standard quarantine systems. leak since January. Since introduced cohorting, keeping people arrived time hotel floors, restricted exercise, brought pre-departure day 0 testing vaccinated every worker MIQ. 

It's also worth noting MIQ leak ever resulted outbreak NZ. Every single leak stopped contact tracing, including leaks Alpha Beta variants.  

We lucky, luck alone protected us. far biggest risk MIQ, travel bubble Australia.  Beau good commentary depending distribution. 50% population vaccinated not, efficacy literally that. 90% population vaccinated, bit calculations get proportions right Natural immunity barely lasts number vaccinated country like maybe 50 pct. well, nearly enough. That's actual number think far off. saying 100 pct wrong inaccurate. maybe review scientific data shown social media real stuff. sound rare me. 

Rare? - remember vaccines around 90%+ (or thereabouts) effective. means *always* going people get virus even though fully vaccinated.  
 
That said, one big differences get virus unvacced get virus breakthrough case *lethality* *severity* reaction.

I love Governor, *he* talking bringing back restrictions necessary? vaccination rates high, would mean vaccine failed. I'm saying that's possible, there's much evidence yet. failure would large numbers vaxxed people severe cases COVID high mortality rates. seeing?

Paywalled ""some"" meaning comes politicians, actual scientists mean, least putting safety ahead community's. /s HMS Great Britain? :( package, flat earth, moon landing hoax, chemtrails, essential oils, gov hiding aliens, religious, antivax.   think felony especially pandemic every thread, bots, fuckin Reddit malfunctioning man read England‚Äôs unlocking July 19th come without risks. cases rise exponentially‚Äîthe government warned might surpass 100,000 day August‚Äîmore people need treatment hospital die. current rates hospitalisation, official cases would need rise 175,000 day‚Äîthree times winter peak‚Äîfor hospital admissions approach levels experienced January. could occur four hospital admission highest among unvaccinated. America, whose vaccine programme slowed markedly recent weeks, England‚Äôs government still needs persuade people get jabbed. Covid-19 cases tend clustered places lowest vaccination rates. suggests two things. First, infections taking place among young people still waiting line vaccinated (or among young jabbed). Second, vaccine hesitancy pockets England continue harbour high rates Johnson insists country must learn live coronavirus. scientists say delaying ending restrictions would simply defer rather avert deaths inevitably occur. say better end restrictions now, schools closed summer flu cases low. scientists worry burden long covid among those, young, still awaiting vaccination: 27% 18- 39-year-olds shots vaccine. response, government says investing ¬£50m research chronic effects disease. Even used fashion, that's fault moral obligation mask ruin life try make unvaccinated feel uncomfortable. still call thing mom? Wow. wouldnt. cut ties grand parents shit. regrets.

No joking human lives.  extremely rare kid even severe reaction covid.

I get everyone posts harps children like  Question
What mask accomplish?
We either get vax covid hide rock..,delta way transmissible
With mod vax rates probably avoid hospital crisis

So masks would drag inevitable? Seems like buy time mode.

Serious question never see much comparing N95 cloth masks. Cloth masks aren‚Äôt effective preventing infection. need proper PPE, arbitrary mask worship. guess bet Asia well containing covid early East Asians sort natural immunity earlier variants covid. saw Taiwan Korea good systems place control covid spread Japan pretty much nothing also able control spread covid. Delta variant Asian countries seem uncontained spread even populations used wearing masks. think happening unvaccinated U.K.? It‚Äôs survival. Covid cause disability even young people. personally know several people gotten COVID twice. precedent state mandates, federal. addition, although SCOTUS yet invalidated COVID related restriction (other churches), hinted might future.

The Feds could certainly require federal employees health insurance (including military), anyone enters federal facility, prisoners, etc. next step would requiring condition employment work federal contractors (similar drug free workplace). gets tougher. would go argue that, outside observed, there's reasonable circumstantial evidence believe likely *wasn't* there: new disease first reported Wuhan, took institute weeks identify sequence virus. quickly shared sequence enabled *German* institute create first PCR test check infection. entirely consistent Wuhan institute genuinely unfamiliar particular virus. 

Of course could elaborate performance part Chinese scientists pretend ignorant even world paying significant attention happening, anyone who'd make argument must abandoned Occam's Razor long time ago. Driving without seatbelt illegal though. Removing legal requirements social distancing wearing masks absurd. zero benefits make things even difficult private businesses. 

If it‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learned since thing started it‚Äôs ridiculously large portion people fucking selfish arseholes won‚Äôt right thing it‚Äôs right thing.

What think happen made seatbelts ‚Äúpersonal choice‚Äù today? psh... LA alone hit one day 2 weeks lockdowns since April correct.

nightclubs closed last year lol. know getting rubbish from.

I'm painting facts particular epidemiologist Zero Covid grifter used pandemic leverage media career herself, including regular Guardian columns. 

Gurdasani member ""[Covid Action explicitly state [""Our objective save lives livelihoods. explicitly stating refuse accept trade ""saving lives"", saying compromise strategy allows us live virus, comes term acceptable level risk mortality.

This ""zero covid"" lobby group want go impossible elimination strategy, late game, much media quote give column inches push this, media benefiting fear clicks hysteria generates. despite fact ""zero covid"" longer accepted viable mainstream scientists. British decided vaccinate under-18s never hit herd immunity via vaccination. Delta need around 90% full population vaccinated fully 15% population kids. 

The Israeli data still preliminary even accurate may mean need one booster. Usually vaccines needing two doses doses spaced months even years apart create stronger immune response, Measles vaccine. could Covid vaccines. 

Since vaccines target spike protein new variant able totally escape vaccine would also lose contagiousness. We've seen Beta Gamma totally replaced Delta much less contagious, though better escaping vaccines. 

In NZ govt announcing roadmap exit elimination next month. expect relaxation border 2022 probably mid-2022. /u/Elastichedgehog making inconsistent points. happens much anybody stating facts hospitilizations still happening vaccination, jumped people stating ""Vaccines work!"" subtext ""stop spreading lies"".

- COVID vaccines [highly effective preventing serious disease Hospitilization still happen vaccinated people, [about 40% recent hospitilizations vaccinated New COVID admissions increasing significantly UK, approximately [40% increase per three statements are, best knowledge, true facts. contradictory.

Even vaccines, 100% effective everybody gotten them, rapid increases hospitilization rates. would worse without vaccine, diminish strain new hospitilizations could put healthcare system continue increase currently are. Medicaid government sponsored private health care. wonder would happen Blue Cross, etc. refused cover hospital costs un-vaccinated people.  keep happening? Every then, see thread that's full repeated comments. even happened me, thread says post unsuccesful, assume deleted next time log on, posted 3 4 comment. Wyoming would huge. They‚Äôre one least vaccinated states country. opinion, thing get US 70% vaxxed entire population mostly act companies mandating vaccines. Lets hope trend continues. anybody know current plans progress adjusting mRNA vaccines lastest strains? non-expert like me, sounds important especially elderly vulnerable soon. [J Jonah Jameson..... variant even less mortality.

There evidence people died flu Australia year nobody bats eyelid.

Actually, flu deaths Australia largely disappeared result measures taken covid. 

Aside that, there's normally hundred flu deaths per year Australia, far cry tens thousands deaths would expected Australia covid allowed run rampant. Studies Israel, Canada, UK shown 64-70% protection infection Delta. 95% number *severe* infection (and approximate based study/vaccine you‚Äôre looking at).

Before anyone says ‚Äúsevere infections matter‚Äù, might true don‚Äôt enough data confident it. unanswered questions Long Covid (who gets it, why, long, vaccines reduce chance course?) organ damage found quite people otherwise asymptomatic.

The vaccines effective, isn‚Äôt personally, I‚Äôm letting guard yet. really apt. schools require kids vaccinated, that‚Äôs standard years. ways opt out. places measles outbreaks, unvaccinated kids allowed attend school. history vaccination public good, neighbors friends, grandparents newborns. U.K. similar adverts following lockdown rules. something strange like guy tubes hanging saying ‚Äòtell man can‚Äôt work home‚Äô.

This malice stupidity quest truth. ok likes would rather know?

Unless find out, could happen again, next time could worse. worse current rate mutations variants?

Will vaccines ever keep up? ever reach herd immunity many anti-vaxxers convinced hoax? lot police support actions. past years taught laws matter people charge believe matter. ""Dude, made sure access vaccines. even read book? Help yourselves!""

Like man floods again.  Good timing, fall could get ugly places low vaccination rates. Apololgies lack clarification.

Yeah, u/robplays (thanks!) says, mass vaccination centers heading closure allow health care workers go back healthcare service, allow vaccination centers used actual cause. SSE Arena largest center (and reached 300k jabs past weekend!) , however NI's largest indoor concert venue, well home ground Ice Hockey Team, life starts normalize, demands events go up, need venues back. 31st July cut first jabs - health minister stated still available people change minds getting them, get initial deployment, however easily gotten. 

I'd image we're looking mass vaccine centers shutting end September - SSE due hold event 3rd September. 

Hopefully threat possible inconvenience enough get enough people take half hour day go get jab month ends. virus basically effect children. basically effect anyone 80 years old BMI 30.   vaccine available, treatments improved, deaths low compered year ago. point someone vaccinated dies choice. Like driving without wearing seatbelts. much government do. I'm tired overused saying.  Winter fun, Covid + Flu + whatever virus waiting us drop social distancing masks. ""Never ascribe malice explained stupidity."" (I.e. Hanlon's Razor) point last wave

How could know point wave fact? Australia achieved 1 million doses last week; rate vaccination maintained Australia reach 40 million doses mid-February Remember gov promised Olympics affect medical environment? fucking lie. Athletes personnels getting hospitalised, medical workers concerned may enough space Japanese citizens rate. Pretty much us saw coming thus Olympics. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs okay thank people job. live Florida. surprising thing guy called nerd kicked legislature.  never said that. Biden campaign ad edited video make look like did. Politifact people get vaccinated, breakthrough cases. long past gone people get form bottom line many people end hospital die. grew 90% white 25% poverty level county Georgia, let tell people can't leave. lucky mom divorced remarried man money got leave teenager. went community college finished bachelor's degree. family still lives trailers run rural houses. unemployed underemployed barely survive SSI food stamps. two male relatives prison drug offenses.

No one gives fuck white poverty despite 18 million whites living poverty line millions precariously close. Republicans lie faces immigrants welfare queens, Democrats even discuss faux pas mention anything BIPOC poverty ""racist"". one power wants poor people working solidarity bring change class war threatening them. That‚Äôs republicans think. selfish, always been. Ahhh see did. disagree. see reason someone make up. sure happening time across country. must suck intubate someone (very likely) took vaccine. again. side effects vaccine super rare. side effects covid common. least 1 100 chance dying. lucky reduced lung function got it. finally getting back normal. unvaxxed America backsliding. I'm going keep going maskless, eating restaurants, playing laser tag, drinking fountains, thank much. I'm going visit zoo buffet soon, I'm likely laid hospital hit bus COVID-19--[the variants change people believe Getting vaccine goes trump, people Mississippi get Maybe time jail, 2A voting rights taken away, lives destroyed would change minds. ultra wealthy seem root every single problem society. It‚Äôs often end hospital something could specifically avoided, yeah instance would expect bit self-awareness. 

I bet lot drunk drivers wake hospital apologize quite bit along way example. Good luck, going need especially approaching issue mindset ""rescuing"" somebody beliefs. Good luck. Last time, due lockdowns, restrictions masking, good chance come across virus. time, us vaccinated keen going backwards likely help spread even faster time. important part. let us embrace Empathy even reject them.

If reason, it'll piss something mightily know hate them, pity feel sorry them. think - read article participant tested positive (gymnast?) said vaccinated shortly traveling. USA never make vaccine mandatory. We'll better luck protesting businesses make mandatory would government Scotland easy country immigrate American late 20s? ü•∫ Problem many circles game theoretically losing hand.

Would agree that, whatever reason, responsibility preventative care falls solely patient? think (US) healthcare system enough contribute preventative treatment patient care level, terms assessments, diagnostics, programs, etc? insurance companies required allow patient claims preventative treatments reasonable schedule?

I working idea anti-vax mentality explained part natural aversion preventative medicine seems predominant throughout country. individuals healthcare institutions great implementing prevention strategy - even vaccines available. God GOP project. politicizing virus trying tank economy drive turnout would mean that's normal human would do. Idiots think clever back peddling 90 mph.

OTOH, plenty on-line options too. Maybe could start taking required general ed courses virtually. you‚Äôre stressed in-person process won‚Äôt well. Start fake vaccination cards distributed every quack medical degree America. Fake vax cards already problem mandated anywhere really.

Good luck getting states Republican legislatures go along that. someone lives la, answer nobody really enforcing mask mandate enter bar. I.e. wear mask get nobody cares u keep ur inside. efficacy rate serious contamination first variants. 

The efficacy may change variants, may influenced factors comportments vaccination rates. US might sub certainly gonna look up, id bet poverty rate California much higher Alabama.

I see would though. late intubated COVID - that's factual thing say someone. judgemental. truth. made another one elsewhere thread like everyone walking around holding grenade. 

Anti-COVID Anti-Vaxers walking around pulling pin. Ultimately I'm happy time one goes there's one less ticking grenade walking around hope get bystanders shrapnel hospital critically short nurses part many said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotten community pandemic, worst over, retiring leaving acute care setting.‚Äù Nurses longer I‚Äôve alive said, ‚Äúfuck out.‚Äù shit taken toll healthcare workers. people refuse mitigate pandemic aren‚Äôt ones suffer bad choices it‚Äôs healthcare workers.

As media, get around like Fox news: ""this fact, opinion."" opinions illegal. still think ""it is""? Probably. Quite possibly, yes. making decision aware that. They're idiots. They're world experts literally kind thing.

And believe giving children vaccine net risk them, order protect others, right thing do.

FWIW give fuck one way other. I'd understand made opposite decision made available voluntary. understand reasoning they've used unreasonable.  can't help roll eyes hear someone say ""do research"". usually means ""find 'evidence' confirm beliefs justify decisions"". insurance soared 15% year, I'm wondering much contributed antivax idiots. Fair point assumed requirement participate the
Olympics would vaccinated, case? honestly heartbreaking. treatment could reduce symptoms prevented deaths. refuse take it.  live rural area central Alabama pretty much described situation quite well. high trait openness internet escape. suppose depends definition ‚Äúlate‚Äù brother living NZ past 6 years. He's originally US midwest antivax antimask whole time. super frustrating perspective complain afar beautiful NZ people knew die covid US. Right problem, wrong suspect. offer two major cultural influences providing anti thinking zeitgeist found many North American communities.

1. Religion depends suspension critical thinking. American evangelical fundamentalist Catholic specifically tout Faith good, thinking evil.

2. Mass culture business glorify emotional response critical thinking. runs gamut Influencer culture, glorifying red meat &amp; sugar healthy &amp; natural foods, putting sports fandom money notion running society via politics. 

How educators hope instill critical thinking skills amid roiling ocean glorified emotionalism? success testament work good teachers students. bad teachers, avatars anti thinking culture? course are. even worse administrators, lobbyists, politicians, religious leaders, broadcasters promote two points mentioned. lot people equate health morality. sick, must something bad wrong. 

I roommate college *nursing major*. boyfriend's dad got brain cancer suddenly remember hearing phone talking it. ""I mean, like he's *lazy*! liked running played tennis him! could happen??"" get grief makes harder rational geeze. 

When pregnant read article, something ""Superbabies"" - lot pregnant women feel lot pressure everything ""give baby best chance"". There's stuff medically proven help like getting folic acid vitamins, well avoiding harmful behaviors inhaling cigarette smoke, drugs drinking alcohol. there's stuff playing music fetus, eating placenta weird stuff expected bodies. reporter wrote article stuff baby born genetic condition would severely limit growth, processing mom go felt fault, everything right, also change perspective parent child relationship stop trying maximize infants ROI.

When add American health care system ultimately punitive, individuals/families punished massive debt suffer accident injury, life-destroying fall debt often incurs, becomes clear how, society, gotten whole thing twisted around weird measure moral fitness. meant deceptive, require bit critical thinking like stats clearly that's asking much readers. Something never quite understood re: efficacy breakthrough cases...

Is every fully vaccinated person slight risk breakthrough cases interactions virus always sneak past anyone?

OR small % people risk breakthroughs vaccine take strong enough small % people?

I hope makes sense... know group latter situation, would seem like better setup large % truly immune, rather everyone protected never sure thing.  Remember access best healthcare could get treatment doctors wanted yet STILL use Ivermectin hydroxychloroquine, even drop either.  yet cult followers STILL insist cure. work ranch livestock trying get ivermectin ACTUAL intended use nightmare right idiots stockpiling ""secret cure doctors want know about!"" One thing often overlooked fact % vaccinated people rises, also % corona positive people fully vaccinated rises. It‚Äôs logic necessarily catastrophic news.
If 100% population vaccinated, also 100% corona positive people would fully vaccinated. 
Overall data still suggests vaccines bit less effective delta variant, still extremely effective overall. Let‚Äôs get impression vaccinations don‚Äôt much anymore. We're definitely sticking guns. Hope comes senses one day. looking likely, though. I‚Äôm officially gonna two month anniversary fully vaccinated 11 days. really need bring back smallpox polio get people see vaccines work? main problem misinformation, vast majority produced ""conservative media"". really underscores fact people idea vaccine works.

We crisis scientific illiteracy country. country (USA) GREED. care safety kids care ADA money returned students campus. 

The powerful country world can't find simple solution protect kids bunch JACKASSES can't work together. bad people stupid realize conspiracy theories wrong they're die.  wonder many never think meeting Pcp cost associated, take unpaid time work, childcare etc etc etc MIL said spent first 45 days following March 2020 caring pandemic didn‚Äôt care anymore, says proudly. It‚Äôs done pride, American I‚Äôm ready leave country family find somewhere humility, social responsibility, civility. (Or even exist anymore?)  Turns weird Christian skepticism along miniscule fraction percentage people gotten vaccine got doctor told to.

Did set appointment primary check vaccine safe first. friends set appointents doctors set appointments?

Access doctor nothing getting vaccine not.

It runs along political lines. Even among people getting sick, large percentage still think vaccine right choice.  ‚Äú99% cases vaccinated‚Äù

To clarify, reports saying ‚Äú99%‚Äù ***hospitalizations*** and/or ***deaths*** unvaccinated people, accurate. 

There‚Äôs difference asymptomatic mild breakthrough hospitalized and/or dying. 

Many, many ***severe***, ***critical***, ***fatal*** cases indeed unvaccinated folks.

And, yes, you‚Äôre right long covid still concern.

That said, I‚Äôm convinced reporting intended deceiving. They‚Äôre different things. see much argument site anti-vaxers pro-vaxers one others side whole thing seems futile going Trump rally walking even one new Biden voter. Ppl anti-vax assume stance part identity, much like right-wingers unbending love Trump, liberals progressive socalism-adjacent ideals. 'dug in', stance part identity, bones. change mind actual impossibility sort justification said stance even face death. leaves us know, ain't good. identity politics (on sides) overtake science, used neutral issue ideologically, we're well truly fucked, science main reason managed freedom-y, life expectancy 45 anymore lives. Couple media outlets creating actual confirmation highways whatever side debate kinda doomed. suggestions break paradigm would welcome... Tbh even think highlights issue healthcare country. Without insurance, even making well visit appointment GP (if even one - making enough afford insurance) cost much - especially living paycheck paycheck. places mandating masks again.

Go live life. sure fewer people polls 2022 Access vaccine also tiny little example 100% universal healthcare anyone US. Citizen human shaped go get vaccine absolutely free. people can't latch this, pretty hopeless.

I can't think another example, besides maybe dialysis believe paid federal government Nixon Carter exec order.  Yeah people tend desperate wanted try everything dying.

And become back asshole tell everyone Covid big deal caught die, etc friend. Right, don‚Äôt pack family move area high vaccine compliance random strangers around think. 


Everyone money that, right? Doctors choice give treatment anti-vaxxers, matter sick are. made pretty clear mean using masks everyone approved get vaccine. People don‚Äôt think real don‚Äôt deserve compassion treatment neither would agree question doctor, anecdotally brother tested positive covid dinner him. mild case sniffles dinner 2 year old spiking fever 4 days later. could unrelated, would enough give pause. What's week away compared lifetime together lost grand scheme things? missing comment doctor be: it‚Äôs lie. Change information sources. LOVE It‚Äôs random micro level beneficial mutations survive I.e. transmissible less deadly. read natural selection. fear mongering real right like anything else, there's better time present get done. are. vaccine 100%, dropped effectiveness Delta variant, still, offers serious protection virus excellent protection serious form disease. unlikely die vaccinated get Covid. hope death toll went 1 shortly after. guys think everywhere soon impose restrictions unvaxxed non citizens entering? God hope so. yes. He's also gonna force unvaxxed medical professionals get tested week.   think know enough point make kind definite statements. one sure causes long covid, though seems affect large-ish fraction people catch virus.

And course, still ""catch virus"" vaccinated, immune system finishes relatively quickly. mild case, prevent long covid? know. questions researching intensively. la Eric Feigl-Deng 

One biggest pieces garbage sources misinformation nowadays. contempt actual disease epidemiologists self-promoting charlatan palpable. Gene pool looking though?  tho? Look protests. set fire vaccination sites. feel People getting radicalized thats good long term. Short term yes, good. pharmacist give specific medical advice, health care providers sense. 

IDK that. Pharmacists talk patient prescription meds, attempt filter manage drug interactions, answer questions OTC items pharmacy sells. agree detailed medical evaluations refer another medical provider, tell pharmacist ear ache, they'll tell products sell probably make recommendation try. Pharmacists significant medical training part Doctor Pharmacy degree.

A Walgreens Pharmacist got Pfizer shots made sure questions. one biggest fears one March actually allowed unlimited visitors without masks worn anyone. know, really relieving. long time felt alone, real life also reading comments here. Lately I‚Äôve seeing comments parents like us, it‚Äôs helpful. I‚Äôve never seconded doubted decision, feeling alone like world gone mad great feeling.

Seriously. Oh take pain meds pain? sick, take w/e pill doctor hands you? get knee hip replacements get hurt? Hell, even take counter supplements FDA approved?

But THIS? Somehow comes vaccines people longer trust doctors. work EMS amount people actively dying giving shit ‚Äúfake virus‚Äù outstanding.  news good (for obvious reasons) bad, 90% populations could get vaccinated we'd probably woods foreseeable future. would take divine intervention point, either due logistics outright rejection. needs said Here‚Äôs article athletes long Covid [Olympic athletes struggling long Covid think fit helps lot well young.   ‚ÄúAnd one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

I got vaccinated soon eligible &amp; furious misinformation/anti-vaxxers there. health care system designed people ‚Äúask doctor‚Äù something. 

I good health insurance &amp; pay copays. seriously going doctor pain. Unless it‚Äôs seriously urgent, doctor experiences are

- wait weeks available appointment
- take couple hours work since wait around waiting room awhile
- interact nurses/techs 
- doctor rushes 5 minutes, rarely takes time answer questions, rushes next patient
- pay $30 copay

It‚Äôs wonder everyone (including people health care access &amp; insurance) turns internet medical questions. started dumb jokes. joined in.

No, I‚Äôm afraid needles. I‚Äôm also afraid virus 99.7% survival rate, thats mainly killed older people. Targeted mitigation used, not.. detriment everyone. You‚Äôre dense worth engaging with. Olympic village could perfect place form Covid mutation infect vaccinated people spread. us willing anything fight them, point.

Also, interest brake pedal here, works great.. Oh, sorry sorry, respect personal freedom. No, want read it. chicken nuggets born? vaccines work though money used week pay journalists across usa write articles covid deaths xyz area among unvaccinated would enough feed 500 sad looking starving african children 3 square meals day month.

THE KNOW Good point. can‚Äôt think can‚Äôt breathe. Makes sense. Thanks providing perspective. live US. Part doctors' nurses' jobs country scold patients preventable diseases like things could vaccinated for, exposing healthcare workers preventable diseases, etc. get fat, doctors *never* let forget it. They'll scold shame take losing weight seriously get back healthy weight.

I'm happy live East Asia now. US healthcare dystopia many reasons... It‚Äôs crazy US help develop ground-breaking vaccines, lead world vaccination rates despite 3rd populated country, still call pathetic lol. many people Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea needlessly died terrible vaccine rollout (or still is). I‚Äôm sure Americans would getting vaccinate people like you, media, current administrations didn‚Äôt keep undermine public confidence. 1) Literally way teach home school allow virtual option. 

2) bigger inconvenience: quitting finding new job one week school starts leaving kids without teacher wearing small piece fabric you‚Äôre around vulnerable people?

3) Schools required pass health safety guidelines. absolutely tell someone something something based keeping others school building safe. (It‚Äôs banned peanut butter there‚Äôs kid allergy don‚Äôt allow knives weapons campus)

4) It‚Äôs ‚Äúa kid.‚Äù It‚Äôs 3000 kids/teens. 50+ adults. 

5) I‚Äôm sorry parents teachers failed teach empathy morality.  predict future? It‚Äôs true. smart capable family members left small coal towns many years ago less capable stayed. dramatic generational differences family members now. 

I‚Äôm sure every family standouts leave bad places. Humanity hasn‚Äôt survived universally stupid, wasn‚Äôt long ago people paid ultimate price stupid rather brought back bad choices via modern medicine. missed point hard landed face first idiocy Crazy conspiracy nut anti-vaxxers ones actually part huge conspiracy. realize wrong they've forced face mortality stupidity, suddenly want repent listen science. Like, fell prey exact schemes scream about....  Eat mask, kid. There's pretty much two ways. One, noted, would even contagious variant. Alternatively, could variant greater degree immune escape. Delta eventually burn enough vulnerable people infect. variant less contagious Delta sidesteps vaccines acquired immunity would quickly spread inoculated population. Oh well There's never limit amount excuses someone come with. rich abundance extra income keep diet check, exercise home even go 15-20 minute walk day. nothing else, go stairs, get cheap jumping rope thrift store, use free home exercise programs accessed via smartphone.  There's lot gyms nowadays membership run less 40 cents day. 


Its better focus less financial circumstances allow do.  things still far cheaper chronic medical problems. Also, point say anything vaccine? way assuming vaccine?   they‚Äôll freak new person, cdc, Bill Gates.

Others welcome become champions vaccine right thing. But‚Ä¶some people don‚Äôt want would rather push vaccine hesitancy Run along child. place you. Go cry mommy big bad man internet hurt you.

Fuck freedom movement. get freedom movement unvaccinated preventable contagious diseases. know what, frustrating thing wave could avoided least severity it. read ‚Äúcaptain obvious‚Äù post one. going let affect mental health like last year. I‚Äôm out! lets face it, youre deep probably think attacked actually exist virus We've never anywhere near low enough case load feasible.

Now we're dealing even transmissible strains, zero mitigation money spent tracing worthless. another reason afraid American police still choice go Facebook. could easily google search ask doctor got shot doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre scared it. comments make pretty clear you‚Äôre scared needles pandemic that‚Äôs killed half million people year one country alone, hey, you.

Sounds like Lottery, Shirley Jackson Infections unvaccinated people lead less dangerous variants infections vaccinated people. Even mild symptoms, infections vaccinated people perfect incubators vaccine resistant strains, higher fitness within individual health insurance? office visit, virtual real, easily $200 per time. PPO HMO insurance usually ~$30 co-pay, high deductible PPO+HSA unusual high bills hit deductible. 

I'm saying that's right wrong, disagree provider article thinking talking Dr emergency vaccine global pandemic that's administered worldwide every country millions eventually billions. can't determine millions dead widespread reported effects vaccines means get vaccine, talking Dr going sway either. San Francisco (hi neighbor) good gets. Enjoy covid death stupid That‚Äôs gets most. absolutely benefit making political.

I'm glad live there. peak Delta India, world first started worrying it.  How‚Äôs Kenfucky 44% fully vaccinated That's bummer you, like bummer 30K people die flu every year, 40K die car accidents, we're never going eliminate risk completely, US first world countries anyone wants vaccinated vaccinated, minus young children worse risk covid flu, restrictions years fruitlessly try convince people get vaccinated let virus burn population quickly, focused protecting care themselves? thing is, blanket statement making rounds media actual case little different nuanced. problem central (federal) government accepting deaths due covid, argument data reporting deaths duty state governments failed specify 'single' death occured due lack oxygen. many state government leaders turn accepting they've recorded single death due lack oxygen

There's also fear prosecution among Bureaucrats Delhi high Court reprimanded officials involved supply transportation medical oxygen saying delay oxygen supply chain made known court they'll ""hang"" responsible. 
Also issue blatantly politicised one thing take away issue governments face lot lawsuits families victims figure made public.  really option getting vaccine. you‚Äôre cop, paramedic, firefighter, corrections officer, traffic cop, mandatory. don‚Äôt like it, you‚Äôre terminated. 

My guess FDA gives full approval, city make mandatory city agencies (nypd, fdny, corrections, dept education, etc.) unless medical/religious exemption.

They dont follow light asymptomatic infections vaccinated people anymore. called ""cases"" anymore.

The obvious result end many fewer cases reported vaccinated populations. fewer infections ""qualify"".

But hard compare unvaccinated groups, every infection *is* called case there.

So 10 people test positive (lets say 2 hospitalizations 8 asymptomatic) ..

That would count ""10 cases"" vaccinated, ""2 cases"" vaccinated.

Fuck every American puts country. Indeed. We're basically ready start administering third doses/booster shots. among first world place order good relationship Pfizer now. Additionally, U.S unlikely another export ban (or whatever wanted call it) moving forward since uptake initial two doses low, better believe third dose even lower.

Canada great place. Cases rise again, may soon rather later, little strain hospitalizations, even fewer deaths waves 1 - 3. Yes, I‚Äôm accounting US weeks behind UK terms Delta variant spread, probably due UK's closer ties India rest Europe. Cases starting tick US too, varies state now.

I'm worried anything, grateful time get vaccine Delta variant became prevalent here. UK performing considerably move COVID tests US right (I think may highest testing numbers world?), we're detecting lot cases.

UK like 5th-6th population US, currently performing around twice number daily covid tests. calling liar, nothing changed. never said exclusive method. Yet again, another strawman. going argue bad faith, we're done here. least vaccinated largely severely ill. Masks alone probably gonna go around even people wear mandated. How? tell white people Africa something? Vaccines effective delta variant. I'm sure question brings variant.

It's decide risk tolerance. Vaccines 100% effective, ok go movie. necessarily. quite long time, Smallpox vaccination exactly walk park mandatory time, even knew definitely caused serious adverse effects small proportion population.

Saying things wheels bus kind wasted breath. can't change it, they're empire decline crashing hard lie backpat hard work great grandfathers did. Fuck country. this? I‚Äôve never heard it, forgive ignorance. say saying said, fact said exactly rebutted. Vaccines prevent infections, reduce transmissibility, extent.

The Pfizer vaccine reduces infections approximately 80%, words 100% people vaccinated drop R number 1.2 based given R delta 6. Generously, vaccination reduce transmission remaining infected individuals half, gives R 0.6.

In practice however 100% vaccinated, even completely discount children. 85% fully vaccinated gives us R 1.92, generous halving transmission barely get 1. consider children too, point herd immunity would 83% fully vaccinated, practice slightly less children transmit much. Currently UK en route 70% entire population fully vaccinated still nowhere near herd immunity point. perhaps level high levels mask wearing plus contact tracing effectively result herd immunity albeit pocket outbreaks amongst populations total vaccination rates. still going struggle get cases go decent rate, stabilise, hence government pushing policies promote vaccination, alongside ""freedom day"" top natural immunity amongst vaccinated unvaccinated populations.

And lot dynamics consider within smaller populations order prevent outbreaks. vaccines high efficacy older populations prevent many infections, older populations amongst care staff often younger, younger people tend contacts thus higher transmissibility, younger people tend amongst younger people likely infected greater numbers. things result higher vaccination rates required populations enable herd immunity within populations prevent outbreaks.

However government procured enough doses - majority population elegible vaccination yet. enough vaccines Australia current time make 'vaccinate fast' option. Original got deleted mean anti-vaxxers fully believe vaccine uptake was, is, way out. need fully cured, people vaxxed = less places covid reproduce.

I believe government-mandated medical care, private companies want mandate vaccine, I'm government enforcement consequences choosing to. Adults much likely get shot need get airplane, parents either get kids vaccinated bring home schooling public schools require (which already many states). outcomes reduce spread. numerators denominators. looking UK data, even though cases shooting up, hospitalizations still fraction last peak pre-vaccinations deaths way down. Even though deaths usually delayed, we're even seeing significant uptrend would've expected now. point vaccines? 100% prevent covid drastically reduce risk death hospitalization mean borderline common sense, least biology 101 (took last year, curriculum).

Victoria locked months insane restrictions people including kids getting arrested.

NSW also locked months.

we one countries can't leave go overseas.

our government's looking zero cases cost billions dollars small businesses closing permanently.

it's madness.  Legal semantics. makes total sense give FDA stamp approval let process play out. Vaccine passport coming. many logical human beings done sociopaths crying thing understand. may shift America culture really tell thiese fringe idiots f*** way off. difficult say, especially look incidences myocarditis amongst elite athletes symptoms often innocuous may overlooked.

So yeah. UK, Spain, Virginia, Illinois, Alabama pointing strong vaccine efficacy infection severe disease delta variant. infectious.  That's point! That's fine approach well (and would say preferable). u.s lacks political spine legislate manner.

Right barely 10% populations vaccinated, can't let Covid in. 4-6 months good vaccine coverage. 

In meantime elimination strategy working well NZ. Australia big problems hotel quarantine system keeps letting leak NSW paying price refusing lockdown long. longer wait, longer lockdown last. know, 4-month total lockdown seem short me. study? Unless break interpretation law, mean. outright criminal going open schools vaccine variant that's contagious affects younger population. I'm absolutely furious powers corporate government effort made vaccinate kids summer school starts. I'm also pretty furious efforts made MANDATE vaccination adults work public. administration (and politicians working public good spreading disinformation) going lot answer winter spent summer sitting hands trying play ""mr nice guy"" idiot anti-vaxxers midterm votes. medical systems mask recommending counties danger overwhelmed.

Honest question - change, would change opinion?  Neither 99% catch survive. data shows SPREAD

You *can* spread, guarantee, continue mask around unvaccinated. 401K might mortgage.

France moving practical direction locking people large swaths life going around unvaccinated viable.  know case regular ol' strain Covid, though looking confirmation also applies Delta one.

You know last winter's massive surge, way bigger we're seeing weaker variant, happened mask mandates across country, right?

Masks always stopgap measure. Vaccines work much better. 50% unvaccinated responsible spread, dropping mask mandate.

Don't believe me? Watch LA see case rate drops thanks new mandate. Hint: won't.

I disagree. minority GOD TELL PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SICK TIME WEAR MASK??

Again, sick ""all time."" said, *you* want wear mask, makes feel better. Wear N-95 even. That's fine. expect everyone else to, though.

The reality is, people gotten vaccines need them. people still unvaccinated *won't* wear them. point, good they? They're panacea many pretend feel like im genuine crazy land, like common knowledge protect there's contagious bug going around places, virus even worse!

To start with, numbers are, default, averaged almost whole year, including significant number vaccinated people delta significant issue.  

If adjust slider last 15 days data available, see 83.33% deaths, 92.20% hospitalizations, 97.59% case unvacinated. Vs 99%, 98.64%, 99.4%.

Add that, people vaccinated rarely tested counted cases, though tested counted get sick enough hospitalized and/or die.

Since then, Malaysia announced switching Pfizer's vaccine finished Sinovac supplies. Got thanks reply. Less two weeks, since April 2020. 5, 3 4 day = 9 days total, less two weeks.

Each lockdown included 2wks lighter measures, 6 weeks nightclubs closed since opening [last last year (52 weeks), nightclubs closed 6 weeks, there's less 2 weeks spent lockdown. ""facts"" correct, mate.  Pretty sure left disavowed good ago, hung bit longer name.

Time move life There's *way* people realize, *especially* site. everyone got spend last year ordering Door Dash chatting Zoom. people's lives may barely changed, others lost everything worth living for. watched goalposts move again, again, again, they've finally decided they're done they'd rather risk [a small chance of] dying rather going living. heard people testing negative home test positive get PCR test.

That's basically ""how intended"".

PCR tests sensitve, meaning get nearly every infection, take time cost lot money.

The home antigen tests way less sensitve, cheap fast. get positive active virus you. Conveniently, that's time contagious. 

So TL;DR:

PCR = Covid yes no?

Antigen = contagious right now? Thank response! UK‚Äôs strategy seems interesting feel like work well also another random guy Reddit. guess gotta wait see happens where. Check RemindMe bot Reddit.

It interesting see experiences different countries play next 3-6 months. agree that‚Äôs point. Sane Americans need retake narrative stop walking eggshells. It‚Äôs really tricky, dropping mask mandates didn‚Äôt work came convincing unvaccinated.

On appears pending full FDA approval. happen sometime future. knows FDA fully approve them. hope take normal 12 years whatever. 

I'm sure why, exactly, full FDA approval also needed military mandate vaccines. lot military remains un-vaccinated that.  think done everywhere.

If Delta advertised, ends quicker. I‚Äôve got friend immunocompromised, you‚Äôd never know looking unless started going detail different medications she‚Äôs on. Basically there‚Äôs lot unknown variables vaccine. able get vaccinated, since immune system doesn‚Äôt function like should, way knowing long kind immunity would last her.

Precautious approach still works delta. shame take it. I‚Äôm sure used sexually, would work even better üòÇüòÇ #actually, Alabama reversed back daily reporting.  see vaxx guaranteed risk deliberately taking thinking still chance catching virus all. believe avoid risks since that's want believe.

See, get this. state, one every 10 residents virus, one every 40 residents long-hauler, one every 360 residents *died* virus. chance severe reaction one vaccines is, - one 200,000 so? Sign fuck up!  I'd give three weeks.  Frankly, parents high risk you, personally, can't get infected leaving house right period. mask help unless N95, properly fitted, practice safe don/doff procedures much good high risk metric whether everyone else wears one not. 

I appreciate situation, need beef protection regardless everyone else right next months matter cases go. That's actually pretty darn good. would plot log linear get point across though Works fine WA too, know he's about.

We've less 2 weeks lockdowns since last April. Nightclubs, last thing reopened, closed 6 weeks last year. 9 deaths total pandemic, know locals even it.

He's trying paint experience WA bad thing, idea grounds - feels disingenuine. schools Florida requiring masks k-5 looking shit show.  Phish fans getting really bad thing?  fuck point comment?

It's part support ""quack"" covid zero - half covid 5000 requires measures maintain vaccines, chance hitting zero.

Vaccines *always* long term strat, unfortunately they're Federal responsibility acquire, mostly see department rorting+military, really screwing pooch one. Even then, end year better shape though. Why‚Äôd make go look‚Ä¶ brain hurts reading stupid people comments asinine want data less... Data good... Information good.

The leadership blame well. Stupidly blame. Hopefully symptoms much milder would without vaccine. Get well soon!   Amazingly so.

Not really, it‚Äôs progressed quickly might expected. 

More qualitatively, look UK: whatever they‚Äôre having, US soon have, right case numbers soon meet exceed previous peak thanks delta. swear god, kids get shit daycare children anti-vax assholes, I'm work hospital dealing assholes, might fucking lose it. OP, antibody reduction quoted requiring booster mainly prevalent elderly immunocompromised weakened immune systems anyways first vaccinated. goes patchy data Israel scientific community trying make heads tails (problems data collection, errors, aka good).

So far, individuals outside groups appear require evidence gathered UK Canada best tell. Breakthrough infections reinfections rare. Quit lying. Hi fellow Floridian.. get vaccine go get critical care. you‚Äôre willing forego care order take vaccine care isn‚Äôt critical. Yet he‚Äôs Tokyo talking vaccine equity stuff discuss COVID response Tokyo 2020 PM.

My parents say prayer every week ""save us pandemic"" get vaccinated, fucking joke.

April 2021 alone.

When say children counting everyone 18, 12 eligible vaccinated. number deaths lower children 12.

More 596,000 Americans died COVID. 300 children. without kind immunity adult population schools open many states. COVID kill children large numbers fear-mongering that. too. like, ""ohhhhhh.""

Month old here. Per capita makes sense absolute # totally There's probably anti-vax conservatives people vote Green all.

Yeah, thinking leftist ridiculous. thought that's comment first. That's definitely best solution. given political battles would inevitably go along that, unvaccinated probably end getting infected first anyways, mandate could go effect.

So instead trying figure it‚Äôs working current variant want group AZ needs one also administer J&amp;J recipients.

It would logistically cost inefficient administer specialized booster shots small subset received them.  people cry loudest ""liberty"" primarily concerned freedom trample others. 29% Australia first jab. 11% fully vaccinated though maybe that‚Äôs thinking of. friend works school believed that.

1: care vaccinated people also know anti vaxxers make possible virus keep mutating one day one vaccine help.
2 amti vaxxers Yeah, many conditions doctors treat. I'm Texas days good chunk people masked days hardly anyone is. I'm city maybe people better mask wearing smaller towns? I've taken wearing mask full time indoors like said idea who's vaccinated isn't.

Oh wait... ... would stabbed spitting little respect decency, prove us mother‚Äôs pregnancy wise choice since brought subject.  would that? job make money. Kicking bunch customers loses money. 

This government‚Äôs job. government needs implement vaccine passports force private businesses enforce them. way it‚Äôs fair playing field every business ‚Äúpenalized‚Äù equally. Ignorance excuse committing crime.  main worry long term effects even among vaccinated. understand fully know vaccinated people experience long term covid/long term effects probably know time. point I'm concerned getting hospitalized dying event catch (I'm vaccinated), hope affect long term. Following topic, since selected single shot J&amp;J last spring.

""likely avoid hospital severe sickness"" J&amp;J vaccine Delta variant.

The implications one still might get ill, self quarantine. Jumping impartial third party. ATA.  Ex Banner here, they'll pay it, pay vaccines medical test that's required work there. I've read multiple articles stated 20% people mild Corona infection, still suffer effects months later.

Very often fatigue, sometimes cripling working challenge.

It's real. It‚Äôs risk tolerance point. would look case numbers vaccination rate state. cases low right state‚Äôs vax rate reaching 50% higher, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably huge risk. 

If want still go lean side caution, I‚Äôd say wear mask, don‚Äôt buy snacks, go less crowded showing practice semblance physical distancing. Gee it‚Äôs almost like problem pockets every community vaccination happening instead trying call areas shame kids, we‚Äôre saying everyone wear masks hope spread continue slowing it‚Äôs 100% unnecessary across board instead ‚Äúmostly okay places‚Äù. hear you. Got got vaccine soon possibly could. would like incentive fore got incentives finalized - end day glad got it. got J&amp;J nov 2020 part trial protected 8 months post-vaccine early 2020? keep thinking pop drugstore get single mRNA shot, talk it. Correct, never fully go away. hope mutate point even vaccinated getting seriously ill. far appear case. wish people would get shot(s) weaken virus much possible, least slow spread. know we'll never reach 100% even 80% vaccination rate, get 60-70% would wonders vaccines remaining extremely effective. vax rate makes uncomfortable.  unbelievably stupid It‚Äôs possible reach herd immunity without vaccinating children. It‚Äôs going take lot infections among children. exactly UK planning/expecting. problem government know many people country, id registration requirements. ten year census results yet.

The national stats vaccine uptake countries whole use population estimate produced office national statistics denominator. accurate thing use likely underestimates population significantly (so slightly overstating vaccine take up). regional stats hand use nhs info based people registered GPs. thought numbers estimate population significantly, people often forget de register move students may register two areas, duplicates, underestimate vaccine take up. Truth probably somewhere two Sigh, yeah bet would go well. people paranoid lay dying adamantly claiming disease fake, like telling paranoid schizophrenic trust meds. going come across 
""proof""more anything else.  Gotcha  Nah, really, we've still got 1m distancing masks areas, England however removed almost legal restrictions which'll probably affect stats unfortunately 10 person lab based study solely antibodies doesn‚Äôt even coincide real world effectiveness shown beta variant phase 3 shouldn‚Äôt really mean people randomly go seeking shots. AZ like two shots J&amp;J. agree position surely know joke repeated ad nauseam longer clever. Masks protect others wearer. You‚Äôre saying one parents right kid wear mask important another parent‚Äôs right keep kid healthy?

Kids might mostly fine Covid still don‚Äôt know long term effects, still transmit family, would still want play odds one parent heard Fucker Carlson masks don‚Äôt work.

Sure point transmission rates low enough mitigation big concern, we‚Äôre struggling get areas vaccinated. then, supporting masks supporting reopening schools trying work way back normal. Refusing masks begging outbreaks shut schools make kids miss class infected.  abhorrent. wishful thinking positive mindset means nothing virus. going back normal overnight.

It‚Äôs something politics decide.

If hospitals getting filled that‚Äôs huge problem everyone regardless vaccine status. Biochemist similar role here, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs pointless possible prevent exposure, especially stick guidelines masking &amp; distancing. don‚Äôt need large indoor events right now.  course singing different tune now. Even countries high vaccination rates, look hospitalizations/cases (among unvaccinated), deaths/hospitalizations etc Loved ones passing change stupidest minds. anti-vaxxers serious wake call.  Source please.

True flu previously known viruses, unknown SARS-CoV-2.  aren't. conservative government fucked totally. ok lockdowns worked well. government's vaccine plan, none. go It‚Äôs almost everything say stand complete utter bullshit. country really kind shocks regard. government say, ""oh well,"" issues securing vaccine stocks? design. new age propaganda one simple purpose, control masses. guess what, we're fighting we're fighting masters. red vs blue, conservative vs liberal, white vs black, rich vs poor, etc etc

Watch this: must see everyone planet.  elementary school middle school, agree, since vaccine isn‚Äôt available ages 2-11 yet.

High schools requiring proof vaccination, excuses, since every student eligible point. now, I‚Äôd say wear masks since cases spiking nationwide. US gets Delta control cases going again, maybe talk way safely relax mandates would acceptable. problem idiots think know better experts deliberately ignore parents: ""Save us pandemic.""

Help yourselves!"" countries publishing studies vaccines use, waiting sino studies west useless. check countries using sinovac. 1.5 years difference USA Sri Lanka, mentioned, 18 years medical progress wiped year. feel will, √Æn end, bad good? .08% vaccinated testing positive‚Äîthat‚Äôs fantastic!

If extrapolate numbers, 244,000 positive cases mentioned article would 15,900 area 100% population vaccinated.  Fda also already released guidance signaling variant boosters needed, would treated similarly flu shots meaning full scale trials would needed. would probably take weeks, maybe month two, start pumping out.

*Good!* Try downvote without explaining wrong, isnt good news vaccine? mean, except states low vax rate»ô, others seem quite good. great, good.

You argue still fast, England mostly pretty strict lockdown first four months year 'unlocked' course three steps starting March, step April, step 19th July (which delayed three weeks gather data supposedly used inform final step decision 19th) . final relaxation fairly minor compared at, like ""we're possibly control, need go 80-100, 80 good enough"". That's astonishingly good efficacy number. Yikes  6 isolation entirety infectious period, number trending rapidly. 0, safe cautiously reopen. Maybe Mississippi form greeting.  you‚Äôre saying makes true sense. Reinfection, whether natural, vaccinated, extremely rare. Regardless variant strain. So, you‚Äôve (or vaxxed) you‚Äôve it. Can‚Äôt get again. (Well less one percent chance.)

So matter much mutates, antibodies nullify it.

Drs court less. refusing fully treat implies belittlement due lifestyle choices. drs place opinion. grounds malpractice. Drs state obliterated court way way less.

You also get point across possibly dying patient much professional manner. may putting everyone around risk yes, getting vaccinated may also put risk side effects. 

If could read response left comment written maybe also read document linked, goes depth risks novel vaccine technology. half LA County protected, even infected never hospitalized

Significantly less likely hospitalized"" ""will never hospitalized"". vaccine amazing, magic. bad luck dragon count? federal emergency management agency could find place keep them? hope well. Can‚Äôt wait every business follow this. lost sympathy unvaccinated dying long time ago. want fucking numbskull believe dipshit Facebook says? Fine, go ahead. That's one less idiot world worry about.  baffles mind. us, getting vaccine easy walking clinic, yet many people refuse fucked reasons. rest world scrambles securing supplies. Crazy times, man. doubt you‚Äôll actually need one, numbers test don‚Äôt jive phase 3 data. part jumped too. didn‚Äôt even see cynicism til read twice. Hahaha. It‚Äôs bad they‚Äôre 40L/100% high flow plus non-rebreather like ok what‚Äôs next step? You‚Äôre like, vent. They‚Äôre like there‚Äôs gotta something else! You‚Äôre like, change code status intubate it‚Äôs gotta quick ability make sound judgment dropping fast o2. wanna speak manager (a doctor!), say they‚Äôre coming‚Ä¶ are, I‚Äôve called code intubate. quick look post history. Claims vax gave ""documented"" heart problems friend's younger brother who, unbeknownst him, hiv progress aids due vax aids caused get lung cancer. also posts question vaccine changes dna. 

His comment almost certainly comparison deniers making since beginning infectious disease, i.e. covid, non-contagious medical conditions, externalities, e.g. obesity, smoking, etc. bad. Another analogy could work ""they hang high busy street dont give shit happens fall"" Great idea!  they‚Äôre sickest? Shouldn‚Äôt sickest prioritized? ‚ÄúAnd one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

So much encouragement 'Talk Doctor'. 2021 America - healthcare prohibitively expensive. doubt people meaningful relationships 'their doctor' anymore. doubt many people even anyone specific think 'their doctor'. I'm actually ok that. Like family member mine. son diabetes got vaccinated, also covid. sure him, I'm sure diabetes getting sick seeing mom went thru enough convince go thru again. 

It's rare get infected twice. long keep tracking people seeing long antibodies natural (as well vaccine mediated) immunity lasts choice. people know they've covid definitely didn't, wait get virus, get vaccinated. point either get vaccinated get covid. could literally get 80% immunity entire country end August everyone eligible got vaccinated. Covid would minor annoyance instead worrying next wave come. Sigh. disheartening knowing months vaccine hesitancy stories outbreaks towns coming. Hospitals small towns, even larger ones icu space. really dumb species. Ugh yes. Thank you... state federal OSHA? one comes around says regret getting vaccine? they'd never encountered internet brainwashing point. know convincing bullshit could made look. realize people political religious affiliation could exploit beliefs spread fear, lies, conspiracies, hatred towards anyone says different.

But started use social media, saw friends cohorts spreading stuff- sketchy random anonymous websites like they'd told early on. They'd like conservative meme making fun Nancy Pelosi one day know they're ""COVID hoax"" Facebook group, believing everything posted- especially sketchy random anonymous websites.

Sorry. one dose Mrna vaccines also effective B.1.351 (33% Pfizer), whereas one dose J&amp;J (64%). point. People trying extrapolate based single doses vaccines, inaccurate comparisons. example, nAb study found Delta actually HIGHER J&amp;J saw B.1.351. Yet, J&amp;J still 64% B.1.351. entire thing mess people, whether intentionally not, drawing false comparisons. Based study, anything expect efficacy higher 64%, that's J&amp;J B.1.351 lower nAb levels. Anti-vax small group even within vaccine hesitant. vaccine hesitant naively stubbornly ambivalent find limited accessibility ambivalent enough stops them. groups easily moved get vaccines relatively minor incentives, showing committed anti-vaxxers. 

Anti-vaxxers boogie men peaking vaccinations. remember late last year peak predicted soley based accessibility without ever even speculate anti-vaxxers would do.   Yeah, saw someone post since antivaxxers republicans, 100,0000 republicans could unnecessarily die mid term elections. That's based current numbers, things get worse, could higher. Spain well though? Germany point absolutely fault gotten vaccine yet adult (or even 14+, though parents might also issue there). could get vaccinated pretty much immediatly three different places wanted to. small church teaches cosmic battle good versus evil vaccines side evil

Which crazy 3rd world countries friends parents live in, cosmic battle church told get vaccinated ASAP. Apparently misinformation happens churches US strange reason. I'd never understand would atrocity.  Agreed! napkin math one sample breakthrough infections, could completely explained that!

She's tired idiots blaming everything medical staff cannulas they're using....the blame 100% belongs pt getting fucking vaccine.  I‚Äôm somewhat echo chamber, little harsh religion vaccines. went church kid never heard single line that. sounds like real old testament stuff. 

For friends different views me, debates listening family town different views, sister went state college, quite honestly spending time Reddit. I‚Äôll tread lightly also it‚Äôs echo chamber side. 

But definitely opened views beliefs different things, still hold conservative values, definitely lot left 2 years ago, especially certain topics. 

It comes product environment echo chamber/bubble, stated. However argument goes ways though, far left areas need aware thing.   gets people trust homeopathy, given lack evidence efficacy, rather trust treatments robust evidence favour?

Why people give equal weight youtube video compared peer reviewed research?

People stupid. know people intelligent make decisions. think interesting establishment distrusted around world, willingness believe manipulating ordinary people.

Among older people know UK, almost blind trust authority, government, church, doctors etc better educated know situation do, happy told (obviously generalisation everyone same).

However, trust found groups. lost along way, people happy believe things sound good, evidence back up. right that. young people know getting vaccine seem think they're invincible... wondering deniers see this, took quick look side.

They think sociopath smiling picture. think smiles tells late, hate her.

They've looked records found relatively new doctor, dismiss everything says.

Some think actor.

And think bullshit never happened. Probably rich Indeed. inability choice vaccinate children makes goal 75 percent illusion. willing look upbringing objective standpoint. kind eroded faith put parents things they've told world. think part really hard people. problem natural immunity last life time. know people infected multiple times already.

It‚Äôs Kansas, it‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs Kansas. didn‚Äôt know that. It‚Äôs good news. Kids understand, still going use immunocompromised valid reason everyone mask kids eligible vaccine? 

Because are, we‚Äôre literally never going take masks matter do, immunocompromised going situation, unable take vaccine. young friend mine currently battling preventable case COVID change feelings little bit. live there's almost excuse. vaccination camps twiddling thumbs hoping use fraction stockpile. even same-day appointments now, think.

-Articles like focus almost exclusively breakthrough cases anti-vaxxer‚Äôs dream.

Though numerous accounts subreddit sane family members might enough convince idiots. read many accounts site people vaccinated unable convince parents, siblings, etc. get vaccinated, too. even attacked unvaccinated family members getting vaccinated themselves. someone also works aerosols, saw beginning absolutely going aerosol threat.

Time show us data. think still alive may snapped strangled someone now. least spared shit. depends define pandemic. likely last big wave. disease continue circulate among unvaccinated vulnerable lower levels remainder human history, much like influenza.   also foundation much medicine. huge percentage people admitted hospitals large amount personal blame: smoking, awful diet, dangerous driving etc. sure ""here"" refers to... even 10% unvaccinated, delta virus likely get them. enough people, good chances running single greek letters chance they'll generate new variants.  Can‚Äôt get vax‚Ä¶same. Interpretive dance.   Yeah, looking old CA tier system county numbers, interesting see things changed last weeks.

And yes, even best vaxxed areas like SF still herd immunity versus Delta. vaccines decoupling case rates hospitalization/deaths, better vaxxed areas still going see less impact places like Missouri Alabama, 70% population immunity. chart, 

There 8 fatalities group, rounds 0% 

86% group tested positive within last 28 days 

Alpha 0.1% fatality rate 50 group 

Overall say less dangerous group Alpha, death never credible risk 50 group. really think need get better perspective calm hysteria. Yes, decreasing life expectancy great, [but look data, see half deaths involving Covid people therefore beyond life expectancy. People can't live forever, try make them. way nature works, humans stop fighting hard. don‚Äôt feel like missed point all. Care dumb me?

That's specifically said ""almost never"" antibody test would vaccine recipient order? - I‚Äôve un friending people. Worst one dad - still hasn‚Äôt seen 5 month old grand son won‚Äôt ever unless one gets vaccinated. people would like wait vaccines become FDA approved. too. also one cautious comes restrictions USA, there's always wonder put back capacity restrictions. vaccinated person much less likely pass virus another vaccinated person.

Just trying wrap head around this. body kills virus quickly replicate much? there's simply less virus spreading? can.

Until everywhere inevitably like France. dad‚Äôs next door neighbor ER nurse hospital small community, family house parties throughout pandemic. also never wore masks outside hospital. could well asymptomatic carrier (she claims never gotten sick), helped spread ER. long ago, ICU zero beds available full Covid patients. stupid question, pertinent. anecdotal, know anyone compiled real-world statistics yet, keep hearing hospitals officials 99% people seriously ill dying unvaccinated. yes, surge, among unvaccinated.

I heard vaccinated people dying old frail underlying conditions. Thank you. mention J&amp;J used implementation trial health care workers South Africa, still monitored, lead investigator mentioned updated results end month. Approx 400k workers part it, right Delta dominating South Africa, best data J&amp;J vs delta have.

That said, believe J&amp;J could booster variants. One would hope developing updated vaccine focusing atleast Beta Delta. know y'all proud helping build mistrust. listen bit more, everyone knows that's fix problems, cooperation. Thanks trying, bit confusing get incorrect analysis well, think I've finally found involving Covid: 598,000 
Deaths involving Pneumonia: 535,000 
Death involving Pneumonia + Covid: 294,000 
Deaths involving Covid, Pneumonia, Influenza: 847,000 
The fact said 
there 63,000 deaths involving Covid compared deaths involving pneumonia. there's column Covid pneumonia. 
Shows can't read chart posting source. 
The pneumonia deaths seperate, 535k people die pneumonia, stating 535k people died also pneumonia. 
It gives second figure ""COVID + PNEUMONIA"" deaths confirmed covid pneumonia. covid deaths will, included 535k figure ya dink. 
Aka 535,000 - 294,000 = 241,000.

Since subtract Deaths involving Pneumonia + Covid Pneumonia deaths, also Covid deaths:

Aka 598,00 - 294,000 = 357,000

So see 294k died Covid+Pneumonia, 241k died Pneumonia, 357k died Covid. Therefore, right original 63k figure low, difference actually 116k. Meaning 116k people died Covid Pneumonia, disregard co-occurrence. real tragedy mean get less treatment

You're right. People get vaccine get *plenty* treatment covid hospital Masking good start, unless she‚Äôs wearing well fitted n95 goes out, it‚Äôs really protecting much. know many people caught virus despite masks. Especially Delta, ridiculously easy catch immunity. Make sure least masks good ones.

I feel you, you‚Äôre tough spot. I‚Äôd probably put solid research best ways counter whatever specific arguments vaccinating are. Essentially everywhere vaxxed. San Francisco old tier system, would red tier. mean nothing really add since agree you. never claimed that's reason low vaccination rate- something keep mind say ""everyone access"" No, antigen present infection choices inordinately affect others, no. freedom murder, rape, enslave people taken away good reason. Knowingly spreading infectious diseases small step away.  I‚Äôm afraid people unvaccinated, display wanton disregard public health apathy towards others find repulsive, would want company? Go someplace else.  Meanwhile US wasting vaccine someone's aunt Facebook friend nurse says vaccine dangerous microchipped Bill Gates. antigen tests detect similarly? Huh, well that‚Äôs certainly move. impression many event organizers hesitant scheduling things right now, we‚Äôll see shakes out. Shit I'd say 30% nurses anti-vax.  need real world evidence antibody titres (although information useful too). J&amp;J performed decently South Africa majority infections due beta variant. think CDC going walk stuff back? Maybe I‚Äôm cynical, don‚Äôt see it. Two long career CDC people quit CDC wrote guidelines led *everyone* unmasking. 

Maybe people quit would walk back, don‚Äôt work anymore. read it, sympathies. I'm 44 otherwise healthy. pretty strong response 2nd Pfizer dose (one night fever/chills/night sweats sore arm while). Also broke mild case shingles. Nothing massive dose Valtrex handle. here‚Äôs another stupid question - deaths surging cases? since didn‚Äôt see lol.

Was advise first? probably way could contribute tbh vaccines overwhelmingly safe, effective free. protests entitled hubris minority dunces. Yes. elderly immune deficiencies worry. 99 percent survival rate every one else. real? directly affect give shit? 

welcome conservatism. Predictable sunrise. time seem give shit something doesnt affect immediately oppressing minorities. clear real world data J&amp;J incredibly effective protects delta variant. recent study news sensationalizing small study, peer reviewed, based vitro data (not live humans... test tubes...) contradicts real world data already showing substantial protection.

Until US CDC recommends getting booster, Dr. Fauci also said soon anyone get one, regardless vaccine had, I'd chill.

There zero real world data J&amp;J significantly higher breakthroughs vaccines far.

That said, good keeping current events reassessing risk profile periodically. Keep good work. remember always defer CDC Guidance guidance primary doctor. necessarily cable news networks. much money stake cancel, apparently. They've already started.

I really understand Japan vaxxing population faster summer. Shit happens Nothing saying factual - actually lies choosing believe. Covid #3 killer 2020 behind cancer heart disease (heart disease mysteriously dramatically too... wonder why....) ""more likely die anything else""

You're choosing believe significant number young people lasting issues *even asymptomatic infection*. Almost everyone know got covid *even asymptomatically* strange health issues since. anecdote, though - every doctor tell this. literally talked pulmonologist Friday. I'm 33, he's seeing *ton* new patients age. 

We know neurological development children. OK unknown?  Keep straddling fence hypotheticals.... right laborious wear mask, unreasonable start new wave pandemic. number available, 0.08% vaccinated 2.5% unvaccinated, bring efficacy 96.8% (which likely upper bound). Ofcourse need real world data verify, understanding immune system role antibodies play it. Therefore draw valid conclusions studies. brand? venue around requires public place regularly go socialize indoors. per capita case rate LA compared MS?  \*Vietnam

Why spelling Vietnam weirdly? James Cameron James Cameron James Cameron. James Cameron James Cameron James Cameron James Cameron! scatted pockets country, population resists vaccinations protective measures. live rural California, county barely 30 percent fully vaccinated. sheriff came right beginning saying enforce respond anything regarding Covid mandates. already see signs outbreak going happen again, school starts two weeks. rough, hundreds died here, people still go like nothing happening. are. older dad respiratory issues. There's enough breakthrough cases I'm worried.  rich clearly dont need invent virus get richer No,

it's literally saying infected, can't get vaccine.

they still treat best can. Don‚Äôt children also never proposed idea locking one year 4 more. simply stated don‚Äôt know long term effects. don‚Äôt care them, care kids young vaccinated. premature longer. countries celebrate naming day instead birthday reason? know, I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs believes, knows he‚Äôs sick needs help, won‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs covid. ‚Äúundeniably‚Äù, meant wouldn‚Äôt deny it.

See think bit missing analysis government plan let kids catch covid, gain natural immunity. We'll situation like 70% fully vaccinated, 20% immune previous infection, push us threshold.

Or would, least, vaccinations Pfizer. Astra zeneca 67% effective preventing symptomatic disease Delta, compared 88% Pfizer, according [report public health England something like 55% fully vaccinated people right received AZ.

You change station, literally well ‚Äústation‚Äù ‚Äútrack‚Äù plays head part inner dialog.

Therapy works. People get out, it‚Äôs exception, rule. great poet, John Cougar Mellencamp, said ""well, people ain't damn good"". I'm sorry disagree: universal masking would absolutely, directly almost immediately help.  


The problem many people want part universal masking. hard part find difficult keep mind (as get depressed stupid pro-plaguers) can't reach universal masking mean give up.  


Every positive effort counts long run, even seem like it. analogy is:  think get 100% exam mean next goal immediately aim getting 0%. pull back look dips compare, say perfect match, said we're still Wave one.  good point, areas less likely vote anyway, puts onus real villains situation. antivaxer/antimaskers. include antimasker that, antivaxers really qualms vaccine, least could wear mask, won't, cause selfish. That's one way view contemptuously. never said willfully, think people follow religion willfully either. get point (again, depending live) don‚Äôt enough place everybody, enough respirators, enough medical personnel, feel like prioritize patients actually wanted something COVID let anti vax people get treated last

They made bed, let sleep it. Time eat shit cake witnessed American politics last 20 years? take pride changing minds new evidence! decades far-right media. I'm brainwashed I'm educated, critical thinking ability, watch Fox get news Facebook memes. found data news article re: Israeli hospitalizations deaths may explain getting lower efficacy figures:

143 people hospitalized, 58% vaccinated, 39% vaccinated, 3% partial.

20 total deaths July, 15 vaccinated.

64 hospitalized serious condition, 12 people ventilators 3/12 ventilated people vaccinated.

Note total hospitalizations deaths much lower previous waves. early December curve case counts look similar July 2021, 600+ hospitalized 10 deaths per day.

I think seeing breakthrough high risk groups; also, almost everyone high risk group vaccinated, would expect lower nominal death hospitalization rates fewer unvaccinated people present given aren‚Äôt many there.

So bottom line, israel seems different position w/ low nominal hospitalization death rates skewed high risk groups, seeing different figures US, UK, EU. No, grew shitty backwater town full racist ignorant assholes, better back kid. environment plays role, blaming everything seems ridiculously reductive me, especially easy access people ideas due internet.

lol :) even delta variant less dangerous kids flu?  say that. Vaccinated people getting virus too, much less severe unvaccinated. Totally agree understand. point it‚Äôs education problem. Ultimately, individual US makes choice whether get vaccinated. wish everyone would get vaccinated, it‚Äôs mandated government. Yea, part. immunocompromised, choose wear stronger mask (N95 instead cloth). fearful, need vaccinated people subsidize fear. kids, unfortunately either wear stronger mask take chances (but spread reduced signficantly). anti vaxx, good luck you‚Äôll need I'm sympathy fools. themselves.

I guess ways anti-vax crowd like children, fits pretty well. So, really think even vaccine get infected every month develop symptoms every month? So, really think even vaccine get infected every month develop symptoms every month? probably go like lead balloon subreddit, I've seen people discussing socialising **12 year old** children kids vaccinated.

Currently UK authorities believe risks Covid-19 vaccination higher children risk Covid-19 itself, causes around 2 deaths per million children, almost pre-existing conditions.  Exactly. Hell, nursing homes hospitals even require Yeah, want bum people much saying, especially given widespread vaccine hesitancy preventing herd immunity places high vaccine access, combined fact countries access time, thinking ""the pandemic over"" life ""go back normal now"" *really* disappointed. 

I'm also fully-vaxxed, young, worry one people strong immune response vaccine get fucked Delta, whatever variant people likely cooking southern, red states, anti-vax sentiment high, cases doubling quickly. gonna say, go walk-in jab even UK illegally lol, nevermind registered GP  police steps start giving tickets ?

also what's sub, awhile people openly disdain immunocompromised now? didnt get Astrazeneca, close 50:50 split probably tipping top mRNA vaccines point.

This P1 2 variants, Brazilian variant. Despite likely cause Brazilian surge early spring, looks like outcompeted Delta everywhere. Why? seriously why? People freaking cases risen deaths barely gone up. It‚Äôs even remotely close bad March. use logic common cold?

There threshold death willing accept COVID way it. lost 600k+ people last year half this. lockdowns, masks still losing hundreds day vaccines widely available. Imagine much higher number ignore like common cold.

There's bit world wide experiment vaccines. Israel UK sky high vax rates continue show strong resistance, US may push aggressive vax policies FDA grants full approval.  Even aside Covid seems like there‚Äôs major Olympic fail every day. saying highly contagious virus going live make people sick over

Yep. That's ""endemic"" means, all.

Fortunately, vaccines prevent severe disease death almost everyone. Treatments also continue improve, dangers COVID-19 continue reduce even time goes on. 

Unfortunately, always deaths, that's works every virus, too. never *zero* illnesses deaths. Even cold flu viruses kill people every year. viruses even cause longer-term symptoms, never talked ""long flu."" 2020, though, one talking that‚Äîincluding *you* I'd bet.

However, inherited immunity ""developing"" it. people already less resistance today. Population level immunity comes several generations primarily killing everyone less immunity raise % people better COVID immunity.

Not great process. Especially since traits tradeoffs, selecting something modern medicine obviated terrible waste life. beginning pandemic, landlord made us home-made, washable mask. far, even able take plane without anyone issue. lot less hell ears co-worker's mask wears.

At rate, make masks fashion. Amongst vaccinated people severity disease lower, due antibodies presumably. rolling average irrelevant statistic Iceland we‚Äôre already seeing exponential growth, doubling days, England. 
Students aren‚Äôt going driver happens next Scotland, another wave, don‚Äôt know when, magnitude.
P.S. didn‚Äôt downvote providing specific numbers. Effectiveness goes like 97% 95%, still extremely effective. Ah, gotcha. Misunderstood sentiment, yes, vaccines generally less effective, still good, Delta. Goosebumps font ""Delta"" written really grinds gears.

I remember reading international media several Indian journalists jailed government telling people drink cow's urine, various religious leaders (some also owned companies selling said urine) said effective treatment coronavirus infection. government officials also encouraging people drink least major national media outlets presenting public without question. remember seeing one particularly horrible video patient ventilator force fed cow's urine local politician wanting ""prove"" safe effective Aruvedic treatment coronavirus.

That one example, several others broadly national media seemed generally towing official government line things bad. local papers reporting accurately. IIRC regional paper Gujurat seemed giving correct assessment really happening ground there, accurate death numbers, etc. think media South India (further away BJP power centers North India) also reporting accurately happening area.

They'll come something happens feel like I'm taking crazy pills sub... circular argument everyone making think realize always around. say another response, places going take seriously still probably continue to. places likely go back mandates though positive cases=where positive case #'s before, even though hospitalizations deaths drastically.

The circular argument see end always danger virus another virus horizon... MAY get worse, tsunami death MAY lag positive case #'s, one MAY kill lots children, one MAY ignore vaccine completely. sympathize caution inability deal uncertainty, exactly outcome we're looking here? 

Cause that's we're looking it, everything really shut virus eradicated. appears though really eradication option without locking every single human planet weeks. part 2 January.  Majorie Taylor Gangrene?     mostly agree you, except key unanswered questions, especially regarding delta variant. vaccinated persons risk long term complications get sick? asymptomatic infections vaccinated people still able cause damage organs? actual efficacy variant?

Until answered there‚Äôs enough risk I‚Äôve gone back easy things, least me. wear KN95 public avoid close encounters strangers. Neither inconvenience me, feel help reduce unknown risk.  I'm aware trickle horseshit. pretending like lockdowns prosperous economy sustainable joke.  Scotland, everyone got scheduled appointment sent letter appoinment time (plus instructions move appointment necessary), think encouraged uptake. think largely based GP registrations, nearly everyone since way see doctor. wish media would reporting this. Tired hearing ‚Äúbut might mutate vaccine resistant‚Äù excuse going back normal. purely proper proof vaccination. people needed/wanted travel, without EUA yet, paper *might* accepted. 

We got CDC Card recently, shows vaccine trial considered ""fully vaccinated"" public health purposes, EUA. post definitely written reduce confusion, always good see little context figures (as far that's possible post title). think mistake referring figures previous poster referencing without explicitly calling out. data last March....it lasts least year.... anti body neutralization. 10 person sample size less. article starting aggregated sites paywall. Automod let post reason tho. Coz we‚Äôre legends That's temporary. try time childhood vaccines take many diseases leaves gap.

A gap depend on...

(long drumroll)

Herd Immunity. much evidence contradicting statement coming many countries yet course focus one country release data methods. CEO Lilly interviewed weeks back, said end next year see enough vaccines produced everyone world, another 4 years countries prefer take IP build production facilities, assuming get people.

Getting people take is, course, another matter.

The fat lady ain't even stage yet, let alone sung. I‚Äôm curious Delta competes P.1. area, P.1 became dominant strain instead Alpha. Delta making way province, it‚Äôs taking fast places Alpha dominant. know mask mandates WORK

What examples state/country implemented mask *mandate*/has high mask compliance rate successfully slowed spread. far actual data shows, places like California, Illinois, NJ, NY, UK, France, saw recording breaking Covid numbers fall, even though implemented mask mandates. look per capita curves 50 states, roughly go go time, regardless mask mandates. there‚Äôs reason go mEDiVaL people using *policy* hasn‚Äôt actually worked, protect kids fine. federal government strongly incentivize states right thing, though, attaching strings various funding items, etc.

It got every state raise drinking age 21. Yep. fully vaccinated crew UK navy ship 100+ cases‚Ä¶ also ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù anecdote agree, totally, you.

Either vaccinate get covid. fact transmissible HIT required vaccines ridiculously high, something like 98%. means basically need learn live covid becomes endemic.

Thank you, needed this. lot justifiable frustration vaccine hesitancy. expect vaccination person target venting frustration person frustrated person communication with.  No, spirituality, it‚Äôs identity vaccines 100% effective vaccine even 50% fully vaccinated. People choosing get second booster think one enough.

Americans dumb trusted basic task own. need handheld throughout process. Canadian here‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt doc visit going cost Americans money? doc alone time away work etc comprehending I'm saying. vaccine effective Lambda variant reported Peru. ""less impactful,"" anything all. Sure - that‚Äôs statistics play  go walk clinics problem, can't get family doctor, develop rapport, years (in NS least) Macron made bold statement effect, saying rights responsible adults kids goi g trampled irresponsible anti ax lunatics. put house arrest. I‚Äôm sick crap causing worldwide. think patients gasping air dying hospitals every day would tell real. different venues situations different standards mean virus does. perhaps it‚Äôs bit denialism disinformation covid minimizers/deniers, antimaskers, antivaxxers, antilockdown folks

As pro-vaxxer, would say exactly opposite. find type propaganda people pro vaccine anything suppress scary news vaccines could discourage people fence. Unfortunately people realize giving real ammo antivaxxers, even bite us butt pandemic, sure next pandemic.

That would include people arguing J&amp;J can't compared vaccines ""it meant compared"", people preventing breakthrough case information collected published, people saying talk boosters necessary yet. BTW know much new delta variant affecting younger people. know affecting greater earlier versions covid. know numbers let's go old info. also expensive. 

My wife able set video consultation doctor. quick put together. went website, logged in, selected time, later week got zoom (or medical equivalent) spoke Dr. 20 minutes dealing with.

The bill $200. fortunate major problem us, kid, kind random bill find ""Virus = Bad"" option. Would meant Ramen dinner week. many people going able make decision vaccine hesitancy even inclined. know someone works elder care let employees stay choose get vaccinated. let nurse go would prefer loose job elderly get vaccinated. anti-vac people set opinions place. Oh good, worried school year would normal. 

/s going cluster mean vaccines? I'll take unqualified opinion board.  least finally stop pretending people get covid vaccine ""not anti-vaxx."" that's exactly are. *exact* thing crazies making fun Internet memes like 2017-2018... seems study shows antibodies point talk J&amp;J vaccine effectiveness. Phase 3 data shown pretty strong response even Beta, looking study J&amp;J vaccine work really bad compared vaccines convalescent patients too.

How compare vaccines using one single metric (neutralizing antibodies count), knowing mRNA work obviously better specific area? Vaccines work differently, appears pretty unfair make comparison like that. know immune system complex, real world data need judge effectiveness J&amp;J Delta. signed agreement happen start stuff none done yet. Irrelevant. die.  That's true. see they're dying, stop seeing faults see human pain. natural us pity them, angry old man painfully sobs ventilator dies? 

But weeks ago, asked pharmacy put mask protect vulnerable patients there, screeched screamed said anyone dying Covid weak deserves it.They really deserve pity. ""realize mistake late"", care long people dying them. 

I'm glad tells late. thing deserve hear. Thank information! Interesting thought. nap vivid dream. I‚Äôll see happens tonight. Jim Carrey? What? like thew Loki reference. ""There's absolutely nothing abdicates government responsibility, please shut it."" Easier said done unvaccinated friends family... Feel free read fact check user posted. Thanks. Holy fuck. anyone reading that's still young primary care doctor -- probably 20-35 year old males -- idea *do* even that...

What need find doctor good reviews insurance network, call make appointment magic words need say ""I'd like **establish care** Dr. Whoever"". That's entirely true. Facebook (and others) algorithms actively encourage information bubbles. exposed depends number factors. know I'm fairly sure we're exposed things. fair, pediatrician experts also say benefits outweigh risks. wait list family doctor years long

You're saying literally can't go doctor years Canada? true. know. realistic all. would prefer class action suits people suffered due misinformation. think that's realistic. still strikes odd overall 5% case mortality rate compared to, example, 1.7% Japan 2.8% Australia. live like forever?

I'm afraid something along lines of: Live medical breakthrough huge even can't screw up. Thank much response. Unfortunately like doc human, concerned she‚Äôs best professional...  People like think long term. difficult compute. 

If think long term would bit concerned saying ""well *die* even get hospitalized see reason infect them!""

This happened chickenpox. Turns chickenpox causes shingles. also cause issues long term, unexplainable abdominal pain ulcers. already risk autoimmune disease bet bottom chickenpox, childhood illness that's mild children never concerned it, activate it. cdc fucking big time usual. They‚Äôre allowing booster shots delta decision going get people killed.  messaging **has been** focused increasing vaccinations. recent shift republican voices (sean faux news)/reps (mconnel/scalise) actually encouraging vaccines, which, sadly, may convince anti-vaxx people. say ""sadly"" unfortunate people rely sources facts/critical analysis. There's also difference concerns stressed.

I'm stressed delta, concerns. I'm trying gather enough data better understanding delta might affect community, therefore trickle family myself. may highly protected delta mean can't reach tickle life fashion. much need save? know need special skills save money begin? Don‚Äôt degree sadly. Drink plenty water keep busy avoid thinking it. feel fine tomorrow likely. felt like hangover 18 hours shots fine. [he‚Äôs covid leading cause death 2020. even close. Maybe that‚Äôs case 80+ brothers ICU Florida twice unrelated COVID. Thank god entire family vaccinated extremely self concious sanitizing everything going touch. 
We‚Äôve yet catch hope stays way brothers sake. seems quite lot people vaccinated get mild like cold bad.  covid patients dying words denying reality Covid.  LOL fuck talking about? [No, leading cause death buying hysterics fear mongering. would even bet it‚Äôs leading cause death 80+ sucks state government works citizen life. let‚Äôs forget Fox News GOP spreading disinformation pandemic Whatever happened 'please' 'thank you'? fucking get rid Alabama? 
Does single redeemable function purpose? let throw covid parties done already. see point saving them. vaccine available choose take happens them. let die. big deal. thinking like less Red pawns vote elections... He‚Äôs one use that. 

That role helps normalize subtle insidious hate propaganda Fox News. high risk individuals would say pretty good chance. general population would say quite bit lower.  what‚Äôs 40%? mix single/double vaccinated? I‚Äôm curious see double vaccinated hospitalization rate them. Cool.

But mean could post sources highly dubious ""info"".

I think North Carolina Virginia posted county county vaccine status vs. infection info page.

You know flu exist? people get sick it? idea behind getting vaccination prevent getting sick stop overload hospitals/deaths nobody cares get fever 1 week, lived flu time live don‚Äôt want watch world burn

I really wish meme would die. people believe ""over"", whatever means. vast majority don't. bunch people got fully vaccinated living life best current abilities, make somehow believe ""it's over"". meme elevated circlejerk.

Everyone half brain realizes process. process two steps forward one step back while. Famous last words. Yes, obviously might delay encountering it, perhaps asymptomatic case. But, SARS-COV2 becoming endemic find hard believe different endemic HCoV's pretty much everyone likely exposure.  crazy see Michael Osterholm eventually right again. CDC director screaming new wave coming us late April May either UK Delta variant going gain traction new wave. seems although vaccination effort blunted beginning wave, clear fears correct.

The Delta variant becoming dominant, mitigation efforts basically gone, unvaccinated counting natural immunity one primary strains virus real risk assuming they're safer ever.

The doom warning upon us sadly, they're going right again.  One thing people don‚Äôt realize falling 90% doubling still‚Ä¶. 80%

Trend concerning course, definitely ‚Äúsurge‚Äù particular point time relative last 18 months Please explain means.   know like death live(black/white) thing right? Kids live end long term effects COVID too. Thats risk isnt counted stats. questions answered check right sources. Short version: already previous finsings SARS 2003, mRNA technology revolutionary genetic sequencing virus chinese researchers.  ""Covid behave like disease nearly wiped last year taking simple precautions: live it"" kinda bizarre take. world 56% anything considered 'most'....   

Below 60% consider terms like ‚Äúmore half‚Äù ‚Äúa small majority‚Äù. 90% get territory ‚Äúmost‚Äù ‚Äúa large majority‚Äù. It‚Äôs unlikely vaccinated people spreading COVID like crazy. Typically vaccinated people (and COVID flu things) even catch it, viral load isn‚Äôt super high making spread less likely. realize that. understand winter virus 'pushed' summer. fewer cases since transmitted.

ps--maybe coffee would allow express clearly. IMO funny definitely obvious fully vaxxed most. It‚Äôs 6% half. most?

Wow. understand ‚Äúmost‚Äù means right? lol, idiots lmao immunocompromised get mean works though. 

Whatever wrong immune system diagnosed yet, but, I'll tell flu shot work long me. Back worked customer facing role, got vaccine September like supposed to, pretty much nonfunctional February I'd get flu. Pretty sure responded wrong person. write quoted part. supply link, however, discusses indictment person spit indicted using biological weapon, also mentioned brief comment. person, unless I'm misreading, used word ""should,"" is.  vaccination areas typically won‚Äôt wear masks.

I get hard fathom people.

The people wont get vaccinated type people wont wear masks.

Mask mandates literally punish right thing along. Believe me, understand. I‚Äôm America screaming inside frustrated someone got vaxxed immediately open public. Me: USA also jails people certain types speech.

You: No, &lt;proceeds state USA indeed jail certain types Right, that's enough talking people massive cognitive dissonance day.  That's people unfortunately. Odds they'll repeat mistake countless time life too. don‚Äôt think bottom chasm That's total population figure. Keep mind millions Americans age 12. know many parents inner circle cannot wait approval 12 year olds get children vaccinated. 

The figures 12+ 18+ higher, obviously.  think may confused. I‚Äôm going said. don‚Äôt know got 23% from. 

56% fully vaxxed most. It‚Äôs 6% half. most? problem opinions clearly go reality (statistics) convince others opinions fact facts. dangerous. Usually antivax people cling small data points somehow prove larger picture. ""See vaccinated person died!"" ""See breakthrough cases!"". understand frustrated. are. understand spewing nonsense.

People need understand bigger picture. Sadly we're getting enough bigger picture messaging everyone position authority (political, science) trying really really hard get people steps needed taken now.   One could make argument I, healthy vaccinated person, moral obligation wear mask protect people opting getting shot... playing devil's advocate, tough time caring people care themselves. know put vaccine! know long term side effects be! vaccines fast made lot people side effects them!

Basically best friend's intelectual wife rambled GF got vaccine. Fun fact already covid wrecked half year ago. Canada jail speech.

 
LMAO gullible idiots actually believe That's DNR, right? bioterrorism spit someone's food restaurant employee, knowingly willingly spreading potential deadly debilitating virus same.

But seemed saying bioterrorism restaurant employee spit somebody's food. That's part I'm disputing. I've never heard anybody charged bioterrorism that. something source for? 


But also, see bioterrorism terrorism mentioned article linked.  


Let really clear. agree spitting people food illegal immoral. sure whether bioterrorism. I, personally, think I've wrong before. know that. start?

I understand thought delaying 12 get vaccinated, subgroup incredibly low risk covid really reason shut society especially mitigation efforts continue them. tragedy anyone dies, fact children die infectious disease, numbers low population level age group.

And small amount immunocompromised people cannot vaccinated unfortunate, frankly alternative never able get vaccinated already gone year end sight.

You expose tons infectious diseases time which, post vaccination, covid clearly good one, also realm risks taking daily basis realize taking.

You reasonable. Russian flu 1977 lab leak.

I feel incredibly confident recommending friends abs family get vaccinated. Without vaccine 70 year old mother around 8% death catch delta variant, around 16% hospitalization vs less 0.001% chance death mRNA vaccine. 

As someone got Covid early epidemic, would wish loved ones. cdc scientific bodies clear data showing dissuading people getting immunized aiding virus causing death. 

My question is: would say someone convinced vaxx died? hospitalized? Would feel guilt fighting medical science caused death?  son would starting preschool fall rise variants general distrust adults get vaccinated, can‚Äôt bring enroll him. He‚Äôll 3 September. hope there‚Äôs vaccine end year him. outlook US residents interested getting Novavax? chance available us end year?

As now, even boosters deemed necessary, plan use original formula. 

Fda also already released guidance signaling variant boosters needed, would treated similarly flu shots meaning full scale trials would needed. would probably take weeks, maybe month two, start pumping out.

But, again, now, reason believe anything boosters original formulation certain at-risk demographics needed near future. Hopefully health insurance... baby exits vagina, seem care nearly much, they?

But basically yeah, vaccines arms means larger percentage total cases vaccinated, usually smaller absolute number. 

It helps imagine extremes. January 2020, 100% cases unvaccinated, nobody vaccinated. imagine hypothetical city 100% residents vaccinated. one case, 100% cases would vaccinated people. 

Percentages weird shit sometimes. That's method. works well animals, antivaxers one informative posts I've read Reddit anything ever. 1.7k cases Korea equivalent 11.1k US. US almost 56k cases yesterday.

They're already still significantly better US despite 13% fully vaccinated. Protect financial interests wealthy? would think vaccinated people could still meet up, extra cautious could meet outside.

Awesome......   Interestingly seems opposite sentiment everyone I've spoken to. see happening simply area careful (same Seattle area, mask-free two weeks). really doesn‚Äôt make ton sense reintroduce restrictions beyond masking little population currently vulnerable.

That said, Delta real curveball far infectiousness goes. hospitalization rates increase enough, reintroducing capacity limits could happen. think next two weeks indicate whether that‚Äôs likely.

Charge fool assault deadly weapon, considering virus deadly many. second person mention that, Google search I'm still seeing period, 2-14 days, nothing saying symptoms take 14 days appear. what's point?

Even maximum week symptoms would appear, point still stands. someone myself, easily interacts 25-50 people average day, symptoms one week, I'm going remember every person week ago. Nevermind people provide contact tracing. unvaxed person, similar situation myself, got covid, wear mask, symptoms week, he/she could spread hundreds people easily. ‚ÄúYa‚Äôll stupid happy stupid.‚Äù  would never let doctor I'm long-time fan Mets, Titans, Vols. get action? need help lad Sure. first line true. every additional infection one person spreading covid around. secondary infections result extra hospitilizations. 

Let's say two rooms 100 people each. Fully vaccinate one AZ, one Pfizer. give big exposure covid, would infected unvaccinated. Pfizer room end 12 people walking symptomatic covid, 2 get hospitilized. AZ room, end still two directly hospitilized, 33 symptomatic covid.

Now say take 100 people room, go individual new small rooms 100 new vaccinated (Pfizer, say) people (20,000 people total). infected person exposing 100 more, causing 12 infections each, 2 hospitilizations each.

Including secondary infections, original Pfizer room would account total 26 hospitilizations. 2 originally, + 24 secondary infections. original AZ room would account 68 total hospitilization. Still 2 original hospitilizations, 66 ones secondary infection. 


Obviously contrived example exaggeration would happen, everybody exposed COVID catches (vaccinated not), people go small room cough 100 people.

However, demonstrate vaccine lower effectiveness infection (and/or onward transmission) result hospitilizations society general, even high effectiveness primary hospitilization. 


That said, spread right dominated unvaccinated. current fully-vaccinated rate, people AZ statistically would catch symptomatic COVID exposed (but pfizer) 6% total population. Compared 46% unvaccinated. expect group account 13% infections (assuming behavioural changes vaccination). 

However, hopefully move forward higher vaccination rates (and especially vaccine passports allowing vaccinated people risky activities unvaccinated), difference would become much important. hit 80% uptake across whole population (Iceland approaching number instance). AZ vs. Pfizer breakdown 10% extra population vulnerable AZ vaccine use, thereby likely driving 1/3 transmission (or more, vaccine passports nightclubs like). Resulting lot secondary hospitilizations. 

Early on, supply constraints important kind population study exist, governments completely right use available vaccine thwt showed effectiveness hospitilization. UK government likely saved many lives using AZ supply safe, rather fully relying Pfizer/Moderna.

My point emphasise going forward, choice available, governments need care efficacy vs symptomatic infections spread, efficacy hospitilization. sufficient say ""AZ good Pfizer efficacy hospitilization same."" guess so. Though like said, people would take drinking/eating. Well people experts public health virology you‚Äôre random person internet. looking whole coast buddy. It‚Äôs job. What's biggest difference? followed closely. black folks least understand history government backed medical research treating like crap, experimenting them/not treating actively disrupting treatment without knowledge consent. anyone reason distrust, it‚Äôs black folks. Sure hope vaccination numbers rise though. That's flip-flopping. People REAL principles never change minds. /s vaccines, exposed people tested positive coronavirus still never got it. tested several times exposures got negatives every time. that? people naturally immune? can‚Äôt find lot info studies regarding that, I‚Äôm curious anyone else similar experiences. cancel Olympics already... *sigh* Never said psychopath. disagree--parents what's best family looking risk COVID vs impacts remote learning and/or homeschooling child.  got most:

""I try non-judgmental I‚Äôm getting new COVID patient that‚Äôs unvaccinated, really started asking them, ‚ÄòWhy haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine?‚Äô I‚Äôll ask point blank, least judgmental way possible,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd them, they‚Äôre honest, give answers. ‚ÄòI talked person, saw thing Facebook, got email, saw news,‚Äô know, reasons didn‚Äôt get vaccinated.

‚ÄúAnd one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

After reading that, still saddened many preventable losses, dang sucks people listened non medical voices instead folks least basic advanced level understanding. agree. wouldn‚Äôt everyone still ‚Äúhave‚Äù mandate? cannot believe said more. 

In real life, everyone know taken extreme precautions throughout vaccinated, say stuff see prevalent thread, met with, ""But never going away, even goal? thought goal prevent severe illness lower mortality."" 

Yet sub, something changed drastically vaccines began roll out. Everyone seems realize they're saying - believe variants mean vaccinated people go back masking, lockdowns, distancing, realize continue forever.

The mission never eradicate virus, that's possible without worldwide push button vaccination followed two weeks quarantine worldwide lockdown months years take vaccinate every human planet. 

And STILL sure thing!

Why public officials clarifying goals? media able control steer narrative much towards ""breakthrough infections"" rather positive results getting vaccinated?

This gives anti-vaxxers ammo begin roll back states high vaccination rates, messaging that's unavoidable vaccines work.  
Cause forget states low vaccination rates, rest world can't get shot right want one. billions unvaccinated many years come, possibly, solution there? 

Do mortality rates justify ruining children's education, ability socialize, economy, people's livelihoods, etc.? hell even anymore focusing much case #'s? variants given, given narrative media reactionary politicians simply want get re-elected avoid high positive case #'s costs. That's even vaccines, suddenly doing? 

If start road, never end, point believe see lot people turning heavy handed rules hand wringing. Even align corresponding rise hospitalizations mortality among vaccinated. that's something people came with. can't really define waves see whole coast. Stop spreading misinformation! sickening. thing is, case movie theater fire, totally ablaze. idiots screaming fire, fine, smoke flames seeing fake part show, sit shut keep watching movie.  Yes, guess we'll see. US I'm looking states vaccinations seems leaving close 70% unvaccinated 1 jab only. sounds like many unvaccinated people still feel confidence ready face endemic disease. try non-judgmental I‚Äôm getting new COVID patient that‚Äôs unvaccinated, really started asking them, ‚ÄòWhy haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine?‚Äô I‚Äôll ask point blank, least judgmental way possible,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd them, they‚Äôre honest, give answers. ‚ÄòI talked person, saw thing Facebook, got email, saw news,‚Äô know, reasons didn‚Äôt get one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

So many people think they're smart ""blindly following government/CNN/the liberal media/'so called experts'"" go blindly follow low-res jpeg cousin shared Facebook. minds, they‚Äôre putting Covid death certificates cause death matter what. that‚Äôs justify so-and-so didn‚Äôt really die Covid. That‚Äôs hospital said. earned right cynical. Getting vaccinated proper civics. Yeah we‚Äôre not, silly definition came with. No, skin color fallacy spread number ethnic groups. Precisely. policy providing proof vaccination beforehand makes wearing mask venue moot point. Since everyone would jab. added /s, tongue cheek. Universities opening in-person fall, right? means lot people various states/countries moving back on-campus.

I've read stringent rules vaccination regular testing, happens there's breakthrough case class? class get moved online? End-of-life care doctors dealing dying covid non-believers make list everyone know call people let know disease real probably dead soon. least _that_ might convince people real thing. crap article matter opinon (I'm undecided). data one physician's political/business agenda, would useful. There's many smart honest researchers doctors real information trust nonsense. TN. School starts one week, virtual hybrid, masks staff kids. usually office day too. I'd wager gop realized entire voter base that's currently dying. Yup. Hannity started telling people last night get vaccinated 1.5 years denying virus, Tucker Carlson still telling people get vaccinated. main attribute american conservativism they're absolute sociopaths zero empathy something effects personally. I‚Äôm saying close bars, feel like masking literally nothing besides hurting social experience. I‚Äôm taking mask drink every five seconds people making dance floor don‚Äôt think masks helping new school year exactly I've worried - majority kids can't vaccinated, like half adults country get vaccinated, seems like gonna another rough months least me. Waves always seasonal, especially winter barely comes seasons. Los Angeles devastated get cold there. We're much mobile society 100 years ago, irrelevant. Peru destroyed right now, seasons, Dry Wet, dry right now. um... people throw plastic bottles windows cars blame litter gluttons eat garbage food blame obesity. bet think drunk drivers blameless well really beer companies blame drunk driver kills child.

Stop defending people choose put communities risk. pushed everyone around get it. gave fence sitting buddies shit did. told everyone I'll first line get eligible, was. 

No matter potential dangers vaccine poses, minor, rare, nothing compared known dangers contracting virus, probably spreading it.

The misinformation people spread literally killed people. work factory amazed see many factory workers still wearing masks even mask mandates vaccinated dropped weeks ago! honor system too. Texas, granted liberal city still. 

I nice 2 weeks wearing mask work cases rising city 2 close contact exposures past week. currently asymptomatic husband also cough/mild head cold we‚Äôre waiting test results I‚Äôm masking work find results are. I‚Äôm tired case obsession. Imagine covid didn‚Äôt exist bunch people knew catching cold‚Ä¶.. Truly go-to excuse would hear child, fact knew exactly done wrong. Again, true Delta. think enforced lot stores still. know least consistent.  sick appears hospital somebody appears healthcare worker telling evidently covid likely going die, sure true express regret? post pictures facebook show others deep conspiracy goes? ‚Ä¶ humans going bars/pubs literal centuries.

People social. fully vaccinated yield privilege socialize bars stupid anti vaxxers/vaccine hesitant? Well, fuck. I'm vaccinated, covid. Looks bad. better person could ever be. Yes people decide don‚Äôt need vaccine natural immunity. also seriously wonder cases testing bias. people care enough get vaccinated getting tested feeling ill? medical personnel deal brainwashed idiots flooded hospitals refusing get vaccinated, abusing staff. idea docs nurses put people. I'd like ""show vaccination card, get out."" Exceptions people genuinely cannot take vaccine, course. Illinois first state go lockdown last March. litmus test. Hope keep parks beaches open least lock time. definitely proven Americans love heaping, steamy bullshit day week. like people walking around grenades hand pins pulled, yes sad someone passes passing means one less ticking grenade walking around danger people around them, hope hurt drug anyone else idiocy. ""religious"" cable news followers participate religious community functional way, ""faith"" comfortable it. think leaves susceptible dedicating time attention following cable news. I've certainly seen sides spectrum. I'm arguing better worse think need community leadership lacking days cable news fills void lot people. Snakes known fly. fucking mother died covid like 4 months ago. parents aside, can't blame one Boomers. Nationwide, 89% people 65 older least one dose COVID vaccine. 18-24 year-olds 52% 25-39 year-olds 56%. people refusing get vaccinated therefore perpetuating pandemic United States predominantly young. careful extrapolating vaccination rate entire state small number infections. big cluster Provincetown, high vaccination rate (some articles report ""114%"" they're using 2010 census denominator). hard know whether evidence low effectiveness, unlucky superspreader happened high vaccination rate area. nature trying compute things outside randomized, controlled trial - estimates effectiveness going noisy, even math correct. That's **extremely** reasonable. We've come far, dropping ball 4-6 weeks finish line?! Agree, start Harris Biden. Remember said trust Trump Vaccine? Yeah....just go ahead google one. mean? Sucks them. agenda science bunk, they're smartest person room (""I research""), never admit wrong anything despite evidence contrary. highly significant population people prior infected, really come difference two‚Ä¶. amount completely unknown due infections never confirmed cases anyone else think Delta outbreak could‚Äôve least partly avoided Biden closed borders India sooner? 

I feel like dragged feet issue first weeks India‚Äôs surge should‚Äôve taken action earlier. amazing people understand this. WaPo article pretty good summary. There's reason think unsafe also enough safety data support mixing shots. Preliminary studies support still protected Delta relative lack data frustrating. decide seek booster may find doctor recommend it.

A booster often another vaccine. shots like Sputnik V use different vaccine second shot. comments came day International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach said cancellation ""never option""

If head sovereign, comment would annoy hell me. seems like IOC fully believes last word Olympics held, host nation. kind people told child victims school mass shootings actors working conspiracy. Americans absolutely never admit they're wrong want get sued potentially prosecuted. That's it. protecting profits ghouls. Cool story bro.

Not randos internet ""the media"" telling *us* get vaccinated, real doctors done actual research, really smart people keep telling *everybody* get vaccinated.

It whole world revolve around you, vaccinated help (globally) stop spreading F### virus, also helps keeping mutating *again*.

The human brain/consciousness savior desmise, literally take us moon also produce people like ""it happened fake im smurt""!

smh...   think reasonable wait reopen completely vaccines available kids ages. least keep mask mandates place. Lockdowns business closures necessary, going 100% back normal make sense yet either imo. comment isn‚Äôt you, you‚Äôre probably far gone, people fence read comment may think agree it:

Well, it‚Äôs media acting mouthpiece scientists doctors, media deciding randomly tell something. That‚Äôs real distinction. doctor tells something, majority doctors tell something, probably it.

Also, vaccines don‚Äôt work 100%, it‚Äôs best do. you‚Äôre going science, you‚Äôre putting people risk cannot get vaccinated whatever reason, people got vaccinated they‚Äôre percentage ineffective, making easier variants form.

You probably okay yourself, you‚Äôre playing sick game everyone else‚Äôs lives. You‚Äôre healthy ever, millions people dead mangled consequences COVID, generally consequences human beings like yourself.   That‚Äôs hospital said.

And WTF would hospital know? Buncha idiots there.

/s cause live bizarre time. Yeah warned I‚Äôll likely pay OOP I‚Äôm putting off. hoping one time thing til get older. checking.   barely feel empathy people life important me, way could feel bad people like describes.  Every teenager whose status know got vaccine pretty much soon could, included. think true we're much less willing accept idea locking people older. It‚Äôs simple, really. don‚Äôt ever see stories like one. Think Fox OANN share stories? chance. don‚Äôt know kill you.  always find something support idiotic view. Ignoring good info favor confirmation bias (I fine, nothing worry about, it‚Äôs people getting it) idiotic way idiocies. gets excuse.  understand people opposing viewpoint. makes lot sense. Seems like long diet severe calorie restriction, people want go back eating junk food really, could start eating sensibly enjoy health benefits without enduring pain. Nightclubs come fun risks... Exactly! terrible price pay gambling chance ""right"".  Nice attitude :-) people spread misinformation either foreign adversaries targets, fellow countrymen misled. It‚Äôs sad.   Thank you. got offered fully funded PhD GTA position, however may give uo cases get worse stay home son. difficult time sure.   relatively mild shingles 8ish years ago late 30s. I've wanted get vaccinated ever since, US, need 50+. one side yes cruel people families, hand nature pretty much human animal history death *is* punishment low critical thinking skills. Nature selection play. 

For like feel sympathy loved ones lost someone, someone who's hobby free hanging skyscrapers eventually falls, supposed act like ""oh could ever happen?"" top COVID vaccine deniers also inherently danger everyone else around them, almost we're top skyscraper, like shove people ledges hang ledge after.  Uhhh, no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm giving 30-minute kid-free oasis, break get entire day. Teachers already underpaid going give lunch breaks, bare minimum regards labor rights. hope quarantine? policy makers ones intentionally stalling American vaccination campaign, belong specific party pushed covid misinformation beginning.  really misinformation. It‚Äôs judgment. information equally available everyone. decisions make ultimately us. people deceived. chose poorly. Vietnam well. send unwanted vaccines.  done mate. *really* knew talking about. equivalent biology chemistry degrees. Would needed take 2 advanced classes technically degrees, 160 college credits. I'm never outright rude people try share example RNA can't change DNA, provide science backed evidence. even though I'm doctor, they'll still listen pundits, Facebook, emails like doctor said above. states counties 30% vaccinated, delta variant dominant strain, I'm telling you, fall winter going bad them. feel sad loss life, man, also hope people get worst sickness ever had, able recover. tell stories, convince friends family wrong. 

A family member mine (and immediate family) got covid. said 104 fever 4 days straight, debated times going ER thought would die. would like see. stories told. I'm wishing harm people. want understand covid still real going come life experience get lot antivaxxers shots. know someone get 12 year old son vaccinated pediatrician said long term heart problems associated vaccine (my understanding Covid causes long term heart problems). 

She also said EMT friend kept going calls people ill recently vaccinated. That's perfect example correlation equalling causation since couple months many, many people gotten either first second shot, depending define recently. 

Medical professionals agendas and/or patient's comprehension skewed towards want hear. didnt know BS. willfully ignorant point. seeing Sw Missouri. believe everybody eventually going get it. vaccinated likely die. still end hospital 8% hospital covid patients vaccinated.

Now bad part vaccinated getting sickest ever likely one family members ending hospital dying. It‚Äôs punishment really, form natural secretion.   Alberta significant group Trump style conservatives right provincial government full conspiracy theorists. Even within government fair bit internal party conflict around lockdowns, MLAs going far telling constituents get tested could stop lockdowns. number MLAs kicked party gone record opposing covid actions.

Even Jason Kenney, definitely pro-vaccine point waffled taking pandemic seriously referring covid flu. think we're point political parties outright anti-vax, Alberta conservatives definitely downplayed risks covid.

That said, probably said become quite political Alberta. suspect rest Canada much better. Idaho 37% guarantee 85% northern half. main northern county hospital went 25-22 hospitalized still 12 ICU, 27 new cases yesterday isn‚Äôt huge jump. don‚Äôt think delta actively spreading yet. Probably 70,000 population right now. nuts people blindly believe information internet tv rather primary care provider! astounding level ignorance among many. exactly agenda? late majority. likely large wave COVID amoung unvaccinated winter. start enough help prevent death. Much world starting vaccinations started yet due lack access. synonyms although strictly efficacy means capacity effectiveness. efficacy effective could effectiveness effective is. think sometimes used example jargon differentiate.

Good advice pediatrician, I‚Äôll ask. Best wishes studies! say even things currently looking bad, ability keep Covid check year extraordinary feat countries accomplished. game gets played, people die oxygen shortage, people died covid. Oxygen shortage result country's leadership ignorant citizens downplaying another wave cause thought better genetics trusted hoax forwards, overburdened country's healthcare system. inflated Indian ego blame last surge, guess what? they're back ignorant selves again. Shit's back normal, people wearing masks again. Like sort dumbfuckery this?   


Maybe citizens ought behave responsibly time around, clearly wont, instead cause another surge, cause another overburdened hospital system, blame gov't oxygen shortages. Heck developed country can't deal 1.4B people misbehaving, let alone under-developed country like India. show personal responsibilities time around, blaming government. FDNY EMS?

In terms close public exposure cops important paramedics even so.

And department corrections? thank Andrew Wakefield starting anti-vaxx BS...   hope doesn‚Äôt treat covid Glad see someone else third. got mine yesterday I‚Äôm going it. first two doses September 2020. Fever around 99.6 now. Really bad arm pain chills last night. also want add this, agree 100%. also bums people can't even get vaccine primary care doctor. (I know couldn't.) think lot people may even go doctor, doctor says get shot, can't muster effort go CVS somewhere else get vaccines. 

It like flu shot. go doctor, say, ""have flu shot yet,"" say, ""no"" (because always forget make time) doctor says, ""you definitely get flu shot"" agree, nurse comes end appointment there. like covid vaccine. Tragically, think convince anti-vaxxers. reality situation, can't shake vibe perfect point.

I feel it'll dismissed like 'and everyone clapped' stories. But, family vaccinated thank god.... I'm tired anti-social distancing. afraid fall &amp; winter would locked like last year new variants take hold. Realistically governmental authority force businesses screen hoping owners would balls establish policies. imagine pretty major bias. anti-vaxxer, covid big deal people know definitely getting tested. also know several people vaccinated still get tested slightest symptom. know one still goes get tested every week free testing clinic near her.

That says all. sad scene. antivaxxers downvoting too, almost like want suppress info truth goes campaign stupid. care, chaos. Could positive one second? It‚Äôs judge others‚Äô reasons getting vaccinated killed friendschips this, never good friends begin bruh Roll Tide shit them. Sure act entitled want feel intelligent high influential people taking advantage people barely research behind scenes save themselves. Costing money means commercial science industry stands make money.

Repeating science scale research, industry.

Biotech lobbysists this.  ‚ÄúGee, listen consensus medical community Cleeetus Facebook? It‚Äôs hard make decision!!!!‚Äù

Sorry zero sympathy me, least America better without them. hope doesn‚Äôt treat stupidity answering question.

How long willing wait find long-term risks? 1 year? 4 years? plan children locked long? clarify, reports saying ‚Äú99%‚Äù hospitalizations and/or deaths unvaccinated people, accurate.

The vast majority claims incredibly deceiving. 

For every one those, look time periods. Almost every one ""99% deaths due COVID unvaccinated"" seen included time period VACCINES PREVALENT. mean sure, include deaths March 2020 now, VAST majority course going unvaccinated, almost no-one vaccinated deaths happened.

You need look stats last week/month see actual impact is, compare percent population that's vaccinated. still shows good efficacy vaccine, impossible numbers people keep parroting.

I can't help think yet ANOTHER ""well meaning ultimately backfiring"" public health strategies prevalent throughout pandemic. news organizations starting ""what want people do"" walking backwards give us messaging, instead starting truth trying accurate possible. figure people dumb understand actual math, give us misleading version try convince us vaccinate. stupid.   US 14 straight days 7-day rolling avg first doses stayed 245-283k, today top end number. 

3,923,360 first doses 2 weeks funny times change. got comment removed high quality information said months ago. see time getting plenty upvotes. 

Of course jumping animals humans less likely definitely possible. course still study. I'm probably optimistic everyone would fucking get vaccinated, might turn attention success isolating animal reservoirs. supposed feel sympathy? shot foot 52 signed day eligible appointment four days later. (Yes, lied. knew eligibility opening next day.) live area crazy people, wonders health apparently. I‚Äôm scientist, won‚Äôt assume either, I‚Äôll let assess long term effects virus. know, like like others. *And* they're spreading virus, they're also helping spread misinformation conspiracy theories convince others wear masks vaccinate otherwise might have. that's even getting harassment, abuse, acts violence direct towards pro-mask pro-vaccine people.

I sympathy people cannot get vaccinated despite wanting to, whatever reason. ones refuse late: made bed, sleep it, they're lucky they'll wake morning. hope see mass amount people dying one worrying feel need anything. point state governments give people want. want get vaccinated that's choice, period.  also means never adult life routine care. screenings, blood work physicals - can‚Äôt access healthcare. Insurance expensive make little much get subsidies.

Having surprise health problem without insurance going even expensive üôÉ

We really need universal healthcare country, please get sort insurance   mean reopen slowly? April June multiple stages restrictions released watched data, final stage isn‚Äôt actually big change; main difference clubs open. mostly agree, I'm totally impressed fact doctor story goes thinking people asked it, moved feel sorry witnesses fear suffering in-person. I'm glad changes tune spends time them, sheesh, people misled dire things always travesty, regardless hearing personal stories. 

But idk, maybe that's difference me, guy time lots reading misinformation online, busy doctors science-based jobs. Literally coworker tell new delta lambda strains ‚Äúreleased purpose punish unvaccinated.‚Äù don‚Äôt test don‚Äôt get new cases OP could chosen thumbnail fitting title.. That‚Äôs pretty awesome. Maybe Cain‚Äôs shows people get vaccinated. I‚Äôm I‚Äôm one 3 members large family vaccinated. don‚Äôt live now. don‚Äôt blame you. Technically son could started last year, age cutoff birthday close together academically ready it. already decided wait year COVID hit I‚Äôm glad did. feel particular view badly wanting Reddit. show compassion misinformed stupid. Feeling smug distasteful  Yes need accept push far see mass shootings increase tremendously airports, vaccine sites, etc. people literally think entire existences risk Totally getcha. Perhaps I'm phased enough corporate America yet. Still young. :) choice career accident, really enjoy it. I'm sure plays role  Ive already got antibodies covid never effected me, guess cell immunity got zero symptoms. need vaccine right I‚Äôve got antibodies hold it‚Äôs actually approved vaccine? need help people understand evaluate information determine sources trustworthy. I've recently spend lot time explaining parts family sending articles, videos, memes woefully inaccurate stay quiet. 

I've tried explain source's credibility inherently linked reputation size audience; factors almost self-regulatory effect also intrinsically linked revenue. 

When media org like NPR makes statement, lot risk statement turns false, misleading, incorrect chips away trust audience time reduces revenue reach making harder retain existing reputation grow future. incentivizes transparency accuracy, motivates NPR due diligence investigating sources leads. 

When organization without strong audience, without much reputation market, revenue tied directly increasing factors means; breeds sensationalism focuses provocative accurate. Making claims draw attention always result net positive organizations even reader retention single digits, outlandish attention grabbing claims times, better. 

This say NPR similar media orgs sometimes make mistakes, editors intend provoke thus skate lines clear, coherent, factually accurate reporting, correcting mistakes properly directing editors extremely important orgs spend lot time, effort, money try find right balance attention grabbing intrigue truthful reporting. also exclude new orgs cannot report truth times. 

News information treated way treat scientific data: trusted sources reporting something, weight lends accuracy truthfulness information. 

None easy explain someone 0 experience media limited attention span kind stuff. Access doctor nothing getting vaccine not.

It really though. access doctor- likely easy access get vaccine. instance, outside town (in Alabama) certain small towns ""rural"" literally dollar general gas station. Neither places offer vaccines. since areas poor, vehicles access public transportation either. completely ignoring fact people getting vaccine should. Vaccination one part, herd immunity other. Without herd immunity people getting vaccine nothing long term.

It ceases ""personal matter"" personal matter starts infringe another person's life. got vaccine today, I've many shitty experiences GPs trust tie shoelaces.

People honestly need medical advice take vaccines - battle already lost point. 11 paid millions wear jersey show up, take loan buy ticket get stadium.

""But I'm 12th man, I'm totally part team!!"" mean, nature doesnt select smart anymore. Might well take banner ''punish'' arent myself. Gotcha, makes sense Happy help! if... people already said, vaccination work, reinfection could see booster?  
And covid recovered, younger people get vaccine? hand, ones realize mistakes ones end dying, solve much. ones get vaccinated survived pretend proof vaccine useless, dead ones actors anyway. ""may"" mean anything, fact news.  know invincible they're playing odds serious infection however clue body respond infection it. Odds get fine wind like 24 year old Georgia double lung transplant spent months hospital.

Your odds COVID-19 related side effects, potentially life-changing side-effects far greater vaccine-related side-effects.

If applying logic proper risk/reward analysis, becomes pretty clear getting vaccinated way go. It‚Äôs misleading statement. can‚Äôt say 1/100 unless know persons age, previous health information current health information.

Misleading Information big factor people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs ridiculous number scaring people vaccination inaccurate numbers swaying people avoid angry simply stating age requirements vaccinations?? least 12, considered pre-teen/teen. Unless child testing trials younger children. It‚Äôs ‚Äúthinking‚Äù I‚Äôm stating facts. It‚Äôs nitpicking you‚Äôre arguing semantics ‚Äúall‚Äù vs. ‚Äúsome‚Äù children anyway. Dude that‚Äôs exactly saying. don‚Äôt long term data.  CDC puts death risk 85+ 600x higher 18-29 age exposed times last year never fever positive tests. literally teach ServSafe manager course is, patriot act, terrorism. handbook hand, funds acquire digital copy prove point reddit.

While fact need renew credential, immediately pressing financial matters attend to. kind stuff stamped out.

However, perhaps favor: sounds like last place one would want stay pandemic unless truly no-contact (and even then, science pointing latent transmission aside, know attitude, ick!)

Mentioning ones status see kind reaction results bad strategy. Best decision I've ever made moving South. week life much better now.  Yeah, really mostly work places grocery stores honestly. it'll really depend place whether they'll actually enforce not. thread months back docs nurses telling COVID stories.

Bottom line trust basis science anything really, pure %100 trust, hence name trust... Please downvote tell I'm anti-vax cultist I've done pfizers first chance I've gotten, least I'm acting like know I'm doing. sadly, everyone likes repeat claim Dr. Fauci said masks work deflect blame. look quote, never said that.

And regardless, even did, president tape talking serious covid February, came told everyone big deal. wayyyy bigger scandal, alas.... Mississippi worst \*fill blank* 50 states.   

FTFY think mean ‚Äúwe‚Äù. Housing market Alabama come 2023 gonna sweeeeeeeeeeeeet. Good thing tin foil hat theory since doesn‚Äôt explain Democratic states bad state loll. me? also suffer problem! choice killed wasn‚Äôt chose get vaccine, chose listen certain media outlets disregard others. vaccine choice merely consequence. still believe sick Covid

That real commitment there, still believing virus hoax even ER treated infection caused it.


""You're right sir, actually emphysema, heart tell you!"" problem people willingly vaccinate ruining people can't get vaccinated... headline really disservice sentiment expressed. Yes stopped calling stupid, call brainwashed. functionally stupid, accurate. 

Stupidity renders blind facts due sheer lack cognitive capability. Brainwashing renders blind reprogramming incoming information. However, easier brainwash stupid people. Yeah lots anti vaxers there. bad. hyperbole. people subway masked up. human willfully unvaxxed fact done basically wasting doctors nurses time point foolishness. exactly important people get vaccinated. protect others good immune systems responses vaccine. friends girlfriend organ transplant recipient. immunosuppressant drugs. got vaccinated. He's telling check antibody levels. I'm pretty sure even get some, they're definitely less anti rejection meds takes. 

I never want hear unvaccinated person say lives matter again. Clearly that's lie. Darn, way give everyone immunity new strain every year.... hbomberguy video Andrew Wakefield thorough. Wakefield prison did. Guess number cases mortality easier hide need start marketing vaccines ""Trump vaccines"" since indeed developed Trump. may way get morons use them. Idk man it‚Äôs hard feel compassion kind people‚Ä¶ end matter cause, themselves

They dying pride stupidity‚Ä¶ pitiful really incorrect every single statement said goes way back concept Elect militant c16-17 Protestant churches.

Sure, also goes back story Job, similar Egyptian story Eloquent Peasant. People thinking way *millennia*. Yes, good, maybe already time start looking next goal? road herd immunity. Herd immunity would pull R0 low, would cause virus fizzle out, would end entire pandemic. Unvaccinated people üñï turned away hospitals. Eligible unvaccinated? Remote island, resources, science. See Jesus Trump save sociopathic regress-bombs Yup. Republicans bad guys.  learned high school science class

Actually think people retain high school science generally would understand vaccine = good. someone said remember ""high school science"" I'd ask following things:

* ATP?
* Explain Photosynthesis
* What's gravitational constant Earth?
* What's mole? 
* seasons places Earth (for least)

I expect perfection, can't answer things basic chemistry, biology, physics, earth science, etc classes taught. know nothing.

Answers, top head, google.

* Adenosine Triphosphate, basic ""energy"" molecule life
* plant chemically converts light energy sun chemical stored energy. 
* 9.8m/s^2
* Avogadros number, certain quantity molecules. 6.02x10^23 remember right
* axis tilt (23 degrees? 21?) rotation earth orbit around sun

Feel free correct got wrong.   Ironically, also bottom 5 least educated states US Thanks asking, also confused got shot? recall fun video filmed car people know real life pushing anti vax agendas mostly shitty idiots.

Most think. capable There‚Äôs people thinks vaccine free, it‚Äôs communism. people won‚Äôt around much longer delta catches them. don‚Äôt need rich work out‚Ä¶

It literally costs less didn‚Äôt US citizen go get it

You citizen, even present ID. US walk pharmacy get free. Haha, same. Moved NC 3 weeks ago joke Absolutely. better someone gets condemned earlier. anything makes people open potential changes lives see much nonsense anti-vax rhetoric been. Yeah. Good luck inforcing lol flu kills people. flu kill people? Pneumonia complications associated underlying conditions. Oh, like Covid. covid doesn‚Äôt kill anyone. Yeah don‚Äôt think realistic. delta need vaccination 90% 95%. Without vaccine approved 12 won‚Äôt happen anytime soon. Death rate may trivial, mean can't spread people 35. spread lead new variants, vaccine may protect against. NOVA particular likely interesting case study mask effectiveness, urbanized areas damn close 100% compliance last summer, case rate basically dropped zero holiday surge. People still wearing masks well - dropped maybe 60% compliance vaccines opened up, rocketed lest weeks.
 
Even NOVA accounts 1/4 new ""surge"" cases despite half state's population, urbanized area state. really slam dunk terms much people's behavior impacts spread, ever question. actually kinda hilarious (in dystopian way) poor sanitation leads BETTER immunity. feel sorry patients though? can‚Äôt get heads vaccine safe works let deal consequences. saying concerns valid frustrating sucks.... case, apply. national messages people, vaccine centers drug stores segregated.... line white people non white people get vaccine get shots batch. keep valid concerns still realize black getting advice everyone else go it. every interaction health care system tainted racism, certainly one them. Siskiyou, dad still got vaccinated despite telling biologist makes mRNA everyday lab using almost exactly protocol vaccines. Lots morons there. big country. Best care often dependent traveling city. afraid next time friend sees doctor may diagnosed metastatic cancer. 

I hope young kids.  mean they‚Äôre letting people third they‚Äôre like blocking potential boosters coming up? Good doctor!!!, gave ""Dr. House"" feeling read "" hold hand tell I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs late.""....ROFL Ive state, say everywhere like that. everywhere certainly absolutely broke  call stories ‚ÄúCCP propaganda

The irony indications Russia China heavily pushing anti-vax propaganda Western nations. better way keep US chaos economy roller skates. I‚Äôm dying long covid, suck dude. problem reason passe sanitaire thing. morons bother get shots yet audacity talk negatively it. Shut up, opinions don‚Äôt matter. believe that. haven‚Äôt nervous since March 2020. I‚Äôm wondering area (San Francisco) high enough vaccination rate overwhelm hospitals. I‚Äôm curious reimpose restrictions week two. Vaccines arent approved kids 12 yet literally need training loads practice order read comprehend academic papers. someone spends time Facebook links academic paper likely real idea content trying say. know one person hospitalized December 19 anyone could tell wrong her. husband hand totally fine. Natural selection mom‚Äôs primary care physician told get vaccine. doctor highly conservative Russian speaking part Brooklyn. Thankfully mom listened got shot anyway.  sure, perfect storm unfortunate circumstances. Couple friends family mad us refuse bring toddler over. Sorry champ, guys vaccinated ain't happening.

Putting everyone else risk? Ya, want anything you. 

Sorry. daughter wanted 12th birthday COVID vaccine. üò¢ Kid, don‚Äôt even ask, already plan. It‚Äôs America, states passed 70% eligible populations least one dose. 

I got mine shortly availability expanded everyone 16 steady flow socially distances teenagers parents adults 60 whatever previous restriction was. 

People right thing overshadowed removing restrictions based milestones like percentage population vaccinated, number new cases/hospitalization, etc. would thought  That‚Äôs interesting. know blood type? Natural selection best Extremely true. made indication let impact interacts treats patients, casually say ‚ÄúYou kind go thinking, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôm going feel bad person, make choice,‚Äô‚Äù erodes peoples trust physicians. put lives hands physicians feel blamed health conditions. extrapolates pretty easily patients smoke, poor diets, drug abuse etc.  This. desire it. sympathetic never means though, however really going tell even shitty school US prepare students rate exponential growth? stuff taught middle school algebra.

Even though drafted serving country thought that's do. healthcare workers large segment population think actively conspiracy, people face face death via Covid, nothing convince otherwise. Hell, even death's doorstep still think hoax. mind wonderful thing, also easily betray us. vaccines say wife nurse NHS. small department shut start pandemic sent care patients red ward (covid.) pressure eased went testing. eventually got back ""day job"" extra shifts work small vaccination centres sprung up. moved ""clap carers"" took place Thursday. ""The clapping stop hate start"" said. treatment delayed suffered result complain - us. want pay rise: she'd rather extra cash spent staff take pressure existing staff. exhausted (more mentally physically feel) posted made smile. I'm happy people consequences terrible behavior. think care folks can't get vaccine legitimate health reason, healthcare workers wasting time emotions help 95% preventable problems.. Good riddance. restrictions lifted manner correlated vaccination things would different. Everyone eager open wait 70%+ vaccination rates apparently.  downvoted terrible logic. Wearing mask negative thing want do. needed I'm asshole big deal, absolutely something want go back to.

And since I'm fully vaccinated, won't. I'm going go back wearing masks morons refuse get vaccine.

Trying tell wear mask trying punish me, even though right thing. Good thing im doctor I'm going keep calling dumb shits.  Hell, go dig around myself.  guess interpretation stuck head considering later overturning decision.  Thanks correction! won't. heard quick blurb NPR like 90% (dont remember number vast majority) Covid misinformation coming like 12 accounts.  people would take second-dose Pfizer reactions heartbeat anyway.

It's hard feel bad. Good doctor can't it. long enough choice forgive   Wow, that's terrible, I'm sorry. hope he's better now! 

Just understanding, February 2020, 2021? 2020 would seem intuitive there, understanding true scope what's going outside. least based timing things around here. There's nothing really known base numerical efficacy calculation.

That really possible blind trials early explosion factored behavior, vs behavior vaccination status astoundingly correlated: calculate efficacy smart situation vs not, longer calculate efficacy vaccine itself.

What easy see though vaccinated still risk there's large unvaccinated pool sustaining chance exposed.

The ultimate efficacy vaccines comes person likely resist exposure population unlikely expose them. Asking question telehealth costs $190 pocket. half doctor visit. live north Arkansas, far you. basically here. last two days noticed people wearing masks lining get shots ever before. first thought ""great! Finally!"" think see people hospital Facebook, thinking side effect suddenly everyone knows somebody bad sick. think numbers reflecting infectious delta here. going get tested afternoon symptoms nephew (who young vaccinated) tested positive morning. vaccinated since March. entire family we've worked hard create ""bubble"" safety going anywhere wearing masks, etc. getting afraid nothing going matter.

Assaulting uniformed nurse definitely felony. don‚Äôt tread freedom live 1300s.

That line sounds good context, look closely said, kind non - statement, middle segment talking someone claimed paralyzed year different vaccine. Started wearing mask work today :( hate can't trust people around me. vaccinated company says wear mask ""honor system"" course nobody wearing one (including morons love scream vaccines 5g microchips whatever latest idiocy is). 

I'm bring delta home elderly parents. Losing one family member enough. make fun want.  already posted Houston reported first USA case Lambda variant majority cases Peru. Get internet go outside.

Seeing infections, hospitalisation, death rising restriction lifted, mean gonne go bad again. 

You lift restrictions R around 1 lower. 

But im dude understand netherlands lifted restrictions. goverment saying whooops, sorry!    Hopefully running quickly. whole african continent lagging extremely behind vaccinations matter time becomes epicenter pandemic origin new variants concerns could, potentially, worse Delta.  600,000+ officially reported. think lot obfuscation going on, USA globally. make good point many older.

Then probably quite 70 year olds died, could made late 80s 90s. shaves almost 20 years total lifespan. Remember got vaccinated January health care workers he's fucking chickenshit? problem would go away

Doubtful. experience people go find anything confirms bias. pretty much remove internet, tv, radio, paper media, randomly lock people spreading bars. kind misinformation proliferated around polio smallpox vaccines well anti-masker groups around spanish flu pandemic.   Would September October? time people's immune systems start wane? would say time it, weather fine, people tend congregate outside, respiratory illnesses prevalent, least another lockdown later, summer. took niece (in 20's) dying Covid large number in-laws finally realize hoax, get vaccinated. I'd like crush thing all

How mask mandate ""crush thing""? large portion still unvaccinated. Yeah think that‚Äôs point. opinion go road perpetual restrictions/lockdowns? Literally ""we always war eastasia"" 1984 style dystopia?

I guarantee current justifications lockdowns NEVER go away matter many people vaccinated, end day literally suggesting here. shutdown society know it.  response be, ""If virus hoax 'prove' Trump good enough president supposed go away election, 'hoax' supposed 'prove' now?"" Oh boy, another variant. We'll fine. Science way powerful 100 years ago.  ostrich-sized

There people dying due companies chasing advertising revenues.

I understand importance Safe Harbour laws and, general, makes perfect sense disinformation can't allowed spread unchecked needs accountability. kinda doubt that. conglomeration media outlets really ramped tandem rise internet (and large part *because* internet killed profitability local tv stations newspapers allowed independent). ""Traditional"" media lot diverse lot less extremist thirty, forty years ago. wanted Biden fail vaccination targets deny victory. petty that. hard believe occurring them. Maybe drunk kool-aid thought kill many people.  ""Doctor"" helped make story public lost licenses shunned medical community finally said something wrong remorseful part movement. recall correctly.

It fucking late though. Damage done. apparently see stories thousands dying vaccine.  difference lockdown certain else done?

At least wait every adult offered second dose? us delicately infantile horrified wearing mask.

The best way stop delta get vax wear mask.

I care babies think. trajectory pandemic strange (because pandemic strange!) used be: 1. overwhelm hospitals 2. Also stay locked older people.

These made sense board. board strategy. vaccines now; elderly overwhelmingly took vaccines at-risk. Yes, kids get sick virus, vast majority don't. end goal here? Kids crappy online learning another year there's slight chance cold get sick? get it; endgame keeps changing. I've saying getting downvoted. frustrating. Kids resilient disease, immune. Ever since Delta variant came keep reading kids getting sick. least unvaccinated kids wear Schools. Helpful reminder whatever shred schadenfreude derive (that may deny ourselves, let‚Äôs face it, clicked post reason), we‚Äôre ones endure going work day in/day seeing people suffer. Fox kind like ""gateway drug"" way, people want harder stuff. many ways, they're kind responsible demise, course going go way. 

The big moment got people switching OAN ""Newsmax"" (lol name)? Election night FOX's people projecting election called Arizona Biden (and mean, totally right end). Ive seen couple posts brain dead anti-vaxxers saying they're restricted going movies, restaurants etc shouldnt paying federal taxes.

Sure. get benefits services provided federal government. headline makes sound like choice. I'm pretty sure dispensers around would give third shot requested it.

I suppose independent doctor might -- doctor's offices vaccines around here. hospital pharmacies. doctors nurses working covid patients saints. breaks heart see many people respect do, burnout they're facing. Delta, Covid endemic now. going around decades like virus plenty chances mutate regardless. 70% population.... UK vaccinated 70% adults, even close. Delta closer 80% population. UK new vaccinations dropping seems like happen vaccination. getting sick also gives form immunity... odds? Asking people cover faces year half tiny ask. Especially children virus small threat them. Reddit neckbeafds legbeards ok course, people want move lives.

Yeah, surprisingly seen people know vaccine come around recently, especially friends kids 12-17. hit nail head health care professionals. large association representing nurses even petitioned CDC reinstate national mask mandate. know annoying people like accommodating antivaxers (huge overlap). also see perspectives Healthcare workers, letting Delta variant get point restrictions. not. means vaccine working well non-delta variants. people actually believe it‚Äôs vaccinated spreading ‚Äúvaccine shedding‚Äù. He's full shit.  


Spends 99% time spreading lies, pops legal reasons, immediately continues spew lies.  


Guy jail, rest Fox liars. unvaccinated offended someone want around wonder they're ostrich-sized. Surely one would reckless!  ""BEIJING, July 21 (Reuters) - Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine elicited weaker antibody responses Delta variant, based first published study effect contagious version.

Maybe stop letting food housing medical care. euthanize everyone predicted life expectancy. Lol. fully vaccinated high risk group, go live life. virus never going away nothing life risk-free.

A lab leak certainly implies conspiracy, scintilla evidence, speculation, top loose inferences top flat lies. fact virus emerged within spitting distance China's largest lab investigating coronaviruses seems like awfully big coincidence.

No, doesn't. seem like awfully big coincidence all.

It mere coincidence made big deal looking someone blame much ""simpler"" (hence Occam's razor) complex theories multi-animal transmission wet market.

This comment absolute idiocy worthy ridicule anywhere said. Animal transmission common sources hes types pathogen.

We fully expect obvious alternative Occams razor. Saying animal transmission somehow unlikely downright dirty lie. labs sorts safety equipment, protocols, failsafes... clear present danger leak.

Jesus. using reasons make lab leak highly unlikely reason lab leak happened. 

Absolute think we'll ever know sure, dismiss accident lab possibility conspiracy (as many media have) disingenuous.

It conspiracy evidence much better plausible explanations available. 


If told Chinese government created released it, would one less layer convolution likely true Occam's razor. would much tougher sell conspiracy circles.

The folks dying hospital beds victims politically motivated misinformation campaign combined unregulated online ad monopolies whose algorithms decided could make money pushing polarizing lies. Blaming people dying hospital beds people profiting like blaming litterbugs plastic pollution petroleum companies, fat people obesity food companies, lazy people stagnating wages Chicago school.

It's absolutely mind boggling.

""Facebook research"" oxymoron decade. People political spectrum anti vax people political spectrum pro vaccination. countries isn‚Äôt political thing, it‚Äôs public health thing.  know *overwhelmingly* Black Hispanic Americans. Although one self-report study, [KFF 69% White adults already initiated vaccination intend ASAP. That's compared 70% Hispanic adults 65% Black adults. Republicans 54%, White Evangelical Christians 59%.  Go get Binax rapid antigen test Walgreens CVS. take test home get results 15 minutes. Easy. fantastic. live DC, plenty friends across river Virginia it‚Äôs good numbers there. Hoping MD (and eventually DC itself) same. Warning without policy change much.

What people understand, federal state governments private businesses rely CDC guidance.

As long CDC sticks mask policy zero force behind increasing vaccination, provides cover every public private companies, institutions basically nothing.

If messaging continues like this, people vaccinated live areas high vaccination rates simply stop giving shit altogether. doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean vaccine isn‚Äôt working.

Well... almost. Damn. I'm even working healthcare, I'm already getting point I'd hard time controlling malicious grin watched another anti-vaxxer die covid.

Hm... guess mask hides it, though. gross.... Thank you. exactly. messaging breakthrough cases behaving goal vaccines eradicate positive cases within months INSANE... INSANE, especially considering real problem amount unvaccinated people and, beyond that, literally BILLIONS unvaccinated people world quite time. 

The point lessen severity infected reduce mortality. lucky, might also reduce spread, appears well, we're actually lucky. 

But never know messaging, undermines vaccine effort puts negative spin places high vaccination rates.  2 February mate want perish, that's choice know two nurses refuse get vaccinated convinced families poison. One told wife couple weekends ago frightened day saw two men suits walk door afraid forcibly vaccinate her.

I zero automatic respect job titles anymore. mean nothing. stats indisputable. matters whether result came lack opportunity lack effort students part. taking quick look average per student spending US public schools, US ranks top 5 among developed nations. 

Now, I'm fully aware averages reflect every states/ local area's educational spending, still really seen evidence student tried underfunded school, able grasp concepts needed evaluate risks Covid/vaccinations. Though I'm fully open changing mind, hard time seeing bad school poorly equip students tries. cousin one people. refused get vaccinated got sick long-term issues post-COVID. Still refuses admit virus. Nobody, almost literally, gotten vaccinations doctor's office.

That's saying though- saying Doctor's office town, likely Walmart Walgreens could go to. Like said before, towns near seriously dollar general gas station. That's it. can't teleport Walmart.

They would drive car (that have), take public bus (that exist) least 1 hour nearest place vaccines. know why, incredibly hilarious phrasing me. pause think‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

To them, thinking ""maybe I'm wrong"" sign weakness, absolutely refuse show weakness.

Color shocked! 

This sub best advertisement vaccinations I've ever seen. anti-vaxxers wet dream things point say, ""See, told things would stay same!"" True, might die COVID, never stopped wearing masks distancing before, would stop now?

The term breakthrough cases carries way much weight point. also gotten way much ink column space WAY focus needs vaccine efficacy reducing severe illness deaths. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well considering 34.2 million cases 609k deaths. That's mortality rate 1.7% (in America)

 Now, according VAERS 480k reported cases adverse effects vaccine including 5,913 deaths(in America). vaccine even prevent getting virus.

Now I'm looking around hard American government pushing vaccine think, why? virus less 2% mortality rate (in America), vaccine chance hurting killing you, pushing hard? vaccine available (in America least) anyone wants it. rule saying can't wear mask. Let people feel best interest move on.

Then see stuff like Haitian president assassinated. president last year refused accept vaccines. Rightfully might add ones offered caused LOTS problems Europe. anyways gets assassinated week death half million doses Haiti? pushing hard?

Look know I'll get voted called conspiracy theorist. know this. fully vaccinated, got first made available (before weird pushing). everything said verifiable facts questions. sick, must something bad wrong. 

Such getting vaccinated. Wdym Arkansas garbage state?? Harrison! can't bad... right?   Two people wife‚Äôs work decided get vaccinated contagious delta variant is. They‚Äôve dodged virus far, know they‚Äôre choosing delta vaccine. 

We live Florida. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good able distinguish one strain another. Heard that. 

Most cops like basic level technicians. They‚Äôve got certain skill set, slight deviation standard expectation beyond ability adjust.  kind claims preventative treatments referring to? things, insurance companies would supportive preventative treatments since tend save money long run.

I think there's test available general public show this. antibodies get vaccination tend match antibody test checks natural infection. specific, targeted antibody generated vaccine. expect see vaccinated cases versus unvaccinated larger amount vaccinated people unvaccinated.

You'd expect see vaccinated unvaccinated represented sampling **anything else except thing vaccination supposed affect**.

If 75% population vaccinated 75% new cases vaccinated, basically placebo-tier numbers (without accounting factors, ""people get vaccinated likely seek medical treatment"" whatever). hope you‚Äôre right pandemic parts world‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll find soon U.K. probably winter US - depending new NPIs - area going back mask mandates. mother, retired board certified anesthesiologist, fully anti vaccine train. happen anyone, matter educational levels experience  No, parents anti vax. vaccinated. allowing kids be.

Pangolins weirdly enough, kinda isolating (also mom dad live home need financial help rent money provides, could easily afford walk). They're isolating intentionally, much social life mom usually gets groceries she'll wear mask. That's headache me, going lot it'd easy decision also.  Honest question: anyone substance (real expertise, knowledge, think medical doctor, scientist, etc.) come credible reason normal, healthy person get vaccine???

It‚Äôs frustrating many people following talking heads basis information spew‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs maddening people making critical decisions based nonsense.  piece shit. people getting vaccinated? assume mostly already highly vaccinated areas? baie dankie cousin FDNY. He‚Äôs unvaccinated firehouse too. Covid last winter. safety perspective, need to.

If ""I come near get vaccinated"" help convince them, absolutely.   I‚Äôm seeing purpose would serve unless they‚Äôre also strictly isolating, people refuse vaccine that. Assuming vaccinated reasonably healthy general, odds bringing virus home way lower catching getting groceries, etc.

And happens 3 months still haven‚Äôt bothered getting shots? keep isolating? 

Unless there‚Äôs really compelling reason can‚Äôt vaccinated‚Äîand post doesn‚Äôt indicate that‚Äîat point acknowledge dealing two fully grown humans responsible consequences bad decisions. would different couldn‚Äôt get vaccine, young children immune compromised.

I'm debating that. however kind shocked people medical community think ok bash people Dr wants too. there's still alot decent people there. Pick recently posted news-related YouTube video Covid vaccines try find comment misinformed.

Unvaccinated people chosen unprotected, infection them, really. It‚Äôs personal responsibility now, answer question. Sounds like information. Risk isn‚Äôt zero it‚Äôs small, place stay zero cost, balance desire stay boyfriend.  I'm even talking academic papers, I'm talking dumbed-down, 1st grade level reading comprehension articles explaining people important mask-up, impossible mRNA vaccines change DNA, wash hands. immunity post-natural infection varies significantly individual individual.

Didn't read rest post here, making invalid argument. sounds like implying current surge mostly driven reinfections.. totally supported data have. Luckily ""hope"" I'm right - Israel's data regarding vaccines stand Delta MUCH pessimistic studies peer-review process, still show 94% efficacy severe things true absolute guarantee. 

The risk everything mentioned lower vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt unlucky person get Covid hospitalized even though vaccinated.

In mind clearly defines ‚Äúworking‚Äù Yeah thats government's incompetence sadly. However, vaccine seems significantly reduced number people dying. warned us againand people still going suprised outraged actions cause another wave lockdowns. It‚Äôs pretty easy enforce employees wearing one‚Ä¶ matters whether result came lack opportunity lack effort students part.

I think narrowly defining lack opportunity ""did school provide service""

Research proved 50 years much less school does, socioeconomic status students and/or community. Coleman Report late 60s concluded demonstrated - ""The influential Coleman Report concluded schools little affect student‚Äôs academic outcomes students brought school‚Äî‚Äòthe inequalities imposed children home, neighborhood peer environment carried along become inequalities confront adult life end school‚Äô

Huge swaths country value education important, cultural issue. 

Then huge socioeconomic issues - students food scarcity, unstable living situations, stress, single parents, parents, financial stress, etc. students resources provided outside school meet basic needs, much less educational needs, support even emphasis education important all

It's simple saying ""oh students try hard""

We're systemically failing children/society large due huge amounts income inequality lack support basic human services standards living. Hell, 14-15% households children suffer food insecurity. That's crazy!!  Honestly idgaf either way, I‚Äôm miserable whether shut üòé I'm hoping one days get lucky get variant spreads 10x easily Delta one 100x less deadly end already. I'm getting tired it. swear fuck conventions concerts get canceled stupid unvax'd fucks rage. Vax ID check events. mean real... dont want another year like 2020 uneducated peoples ignorance.  It‚Äôll activate immune system, recruiting B cell, fight infection. activation makes even effective encounter covid virus again. mean....yeah. countries money pay get first get poorer countries. I'm rich poor, need thing, need fund it, I'm definitely getting first dibs. That's works. Nah. never wanted wear mask, social distance, cancel Thanksgiving, 2020 protect around me. vaccine free, widely available, extremely effective preventing serious illness. point, really give shit ""vaccine hesitant"". They've months ""do research"" people comply old mask mandates certainly possible new ones either good. [pandemic Let get sick, maybe change minds, don't, get sort natural immunity. beyond I'm longer willing face even slightest inconvenience protect people there's reason gotten shot like millions others like fine.  1. Go new school, speak superior, union. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs job opening somewhere. not, should‚Äôve prepared sooner.
2. everyone equally vulnerable, know vulnerable others. Considering vaccine available, small percentage take precaution see fit. thing 0 risk society, infringe one‚Äôs personal health sake consider inconvenient selfish.
3. That‚Äôs fair, schools also make decision *not* pass guidelines perceive benefit, possibly [adverse medical psychological 3000 kids/teens lowest risk loll, lot +50 adults probably high risk.
5. parents teachers taught lot empathy morality (and statistical analysis might good read on). That‚Äôs feel sorry students taught person covers ignorance selfishness false belief superior morality. agree, innocent people getting hurt, would horrific. realize people cant reasoned 300-400 people dying daily thing less prevent. Well athletes aren‚Äôt known smart Colorado Department Public Health Environment released updated [school COVID-19 vaccination Colorado‚Äôs best defense pandemic, vaccination also prevents disruptions in-person learning. Fully vaccinated staff students never miss school due quarantine, fully vaccinated staff students advised wear masks unless choose to. COVID-19 vaccines highly successful reducing transmission, infections, deaths.

Right now, agree approach. Delta Lambda variants start prove greater immune escape function increased severity illness, would likely change mind... Check happens partially vaccinated (it 87% non-fully vaccinated). Also, whether symptomatic, hospitalized, etc. It‚Äôs possible shed dead virus months following covid, return positive PCR test, hence CDC doesn‚Äôt require negative PCR test infection return work/school/etc Well unlike side, think letting people die great political strategy true. think fair judge people ""alternate truth"" views. think also something companies actively encourage peddling kind theories. think guy get that. want everyone wear mask 0 risk all... never happen. want us mask forever. also wealthier countries far higher death tolls due relatively old population. I'm pretty sure vaccine inequality, necessarily mean current distribution flawed. Question, first dose, got direct contact 4 days later someone covid (bare mind someone shots back January). chances I'm infected? two days, symptoms far  so? treats patients equally....did read article? idiotic statement whole article ""Upwards 11,000 members NYPD infected COVID-19 statistically far lower likelihood re-contracting disease.‚Äù may somewhat true original virus strain, unlikely new strains mutation come. Vaccines already contracted still much effective providing immunity infection. would department use latest science advocate vaccinations? ""Me me""? try reading said. think understood well. clearly missing something, somewhere. arguing you, beware relying randomized controlled trials, going happening time soon things interested in. RCTs cost ton money take months years, there's long publication period, followed longer argument whether trial valid anyway. 

We need move lot quicker that, use information things make sense now. Saying ""there's RCT I'm going anything"" kind error. Makes perfect sense especially given NYPD proclivities.  feel like we've made circle vaccinated anti-maskers care older groups treat cold/flu now. like last year anti-maskers care covid 65+ could die it. still enough data delta even safe vaccinated, know long term medical problems causes people read headline yet. lmao, can't people cautious, went global lockdown reason. recent Virginia stats, select last month last week data  specifically denied mandate thought conventions would move something ‚Äúmother fuckin‚Äù variety, though. first thing saw share article quote right Facebook add nice contrast misinformation. üôÇ Vaccination works! Seems like bigger events Euros Copa America now. yeah Olympics won‚Äôt help. wtf talking about? literally gave three stimulus checks everyone America. last bit article especially jarring gives good sense issue. 

Asking unvaccinated patients consulted general care practitioner vaccine hearing things tv/facebook/from friend. answered 'no'. Taking medical advice everyone doctor bode well society. lol, push even harder, make even political.

Every Republican voting next election step forward America. Sure am. People free whatever want. Life doesn‚Äôt stop covid, you‚Äôre likely die anything else. likely you‚Äôll mild asymptomatic illness recover completely.

Very reasonable. factual too. Sorry you‚Äôre hysterics. don‚Äôt think happen. Employees vaxxed(at least want it). They‚Äôre liable responsible customers aren‚Äôt vaxxed gets infected. Previous attempt get businesses follow mask mandate didn‚Äôt really play well. agree you, say let try. innocent people still get hurt bothers me. Stop! I'm wearing shorts work move around office occasionally. Still missing point. fact getting vaccinated greatly reduce chance dying covid greatly reduce passing someone else also could die. many people line. fine doesnt mean didnt pass onto someone else died.   That's literally true, misleading. like saying know long term effects wearing masks school. care long people dying them.

I think mistake, caring others, empathy.  I‚Äôve asked this. doctor willing recommend autoimmune condition prefers data whether benefit additional shots outweighs possible risk disease flaring (which happen second shot worth it)

If infect someone pass other..... big trouble. Often foresee car recognize consequences getting hit car. brain calculate probability getting hit car however distance away you. Plus car drivers, driven semi-decent people... ur protesting certain states, actively trying avoid hitting you.

Lets say newly blind kid, crosswalks street lights they're crossing freeway psychopath drivers, arent actively trying hit kid care hit(wearing masks), going different speeds 10-60mph(speed makes big difference survivability car crash).

I guess Im optimist looking opinion here. 
So 5 months time, wondering world like. 
Surely, masses highly vaccinated time..but delta say turn curve. variants that. That's assuming even willing share information contact tracers. know someone vehemently disbelieved COVID, huge extended family gathering, refused share information contact tracers. husband got sick, mother father died it. Still refused share information, still refuses vaccinate. many, many people like spread across US. Colds weird seasonal cycle year suppressed lot measures taken limit covid spread. Definitely could covid, could unseasonable could too. EMTs serve branch fire department likely know what's Protection goes across time, get infected even protected. 

I look hard cut-off time really lost protection. Hundreds epidemiologists warned premature relaxation indoor mask mandates. outlier.  thank one particular ‚Äônews‚Äô outlet spreading lies GOP politicians playing vocal idiots.

There's 1 point.

Fox mainstream one, Newsmax OAN extreme versions becoming far common.

They're basically conspiracy theorists spouting nonsense claims, presented news report. Bioterrorism 1) Intentional Spread 2) Using Harmful Biological Substance.

So yes, person spitting, that's bioterrorism; however they're knowing highly contagious infected one classified substances, bioterrorism.

Here [one shows nuances. man HIV, proven intentionally trying spread it, charge dropped yet assault charge remained.

One reason believe still trying figure disease still new. far easier charge someone bioterrorism use known agents. It'll harder proven one. likely one, US, least, federal level moves slow. costs downright trivial

I agree benefits masking outweigh costs, correct. think lots Redditors confuse fact *they* mind wearing masks view that, therefore, costs masking trivial.

Masks uncomfortable, fog glasses, make communication difficult (I'm hard hearing, college class last semester often struggled hear Professors students masks). much, come certain psychological cost constant reminder pandemic.

Lots people hate wearing masks, really wrong; different preferences Viruses bacteria ubiquitous always around.

The mitigation efforts covid worked sort covid highly highly infectious. Even though reason put place, mitigation efforts incredibly effective stopping less infectious diseases.

But still lurking environment soon people started interacting resumed normal transmission. trouble though, due enough vaccine go around? Lockdown fine good, without second step (vaccinations) fear we're going living terrible version Groundhog Day. people legitimately feral choice...both intellectually &amp; behaviorally. get field hospital beds (at best) protect staff &amp; free resources patients.

Just toss O2 tanks twice day fill water bowl call day. suppose see goes hope talking Facebook. Facebook removed links articles allowed curated news posts problem would go away. subreddit surprisingly anti-vax. source information would worried vaccine protect Delta, protect getting sick, protect transmission. ""It's possible vaccine perfect"" gets distorted people clue assess risk. 

Personally, think vaccine works. point breakthrough cases spread still regardless sick are. spreads people hospital. people hospital patient care goes down. happens people die survivable ailments.

Again like watch world burn go ahead don‚Äôt take precautions, damn hard wear piece blown fibers face hole Fucking Reddit. Bye kids right? sure hope triple masking simple can't take chances kid's life?  try non-judgmental I‚Äôm getting new COVID patient that‚Äôs unvaccinated, really started asking them, ‚ÄòWhy haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine?‚Äô I‚Äôll ask point blank, least judgmental way possible,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd them, they‚Äôre honest, give answers. ‚ÄòI talked person, saw thing Facebook, got email, saw news,‚Äô know, reasons didn‚Äôt get one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

Unless things get dramatically bad hospital wise death wise, I‚Äôm going support reimposing restrictions. system literally broken insurance pharmaceutical companies, deadbeats. Amazing insurance often pays 3 times someone paying pocket pays. Paid 780 dollars Ultrasound heart uninsured. got done again, insurance. Insurance paid 2,950 it.

Some people going want forever everything limited. reality, humans poor evaluating risks, Covid thing everyone‚Äôs minds long, long time. Governments done everything power make people fearful virus. Don‚Äôt get wrong, needed take seriously, vaccines widely available uptake high, it‚Äôs time move on. Nah, hesitant time get program - least US, pretty much adult intends getting vaccinated already shots. 

Those saying get full approval comes - part - using cover now. full approval comes, they'll find reason get (more likely) COVID already, they'll say there's reason get vaccinated. question reach #? not, what's plan? ‚ÄúThis new hoax‚Äù

Either way, link showed, indicted using biological weapon. charge is, ""perpetrating biological weapon hoax"" 


I understood u/Coffeineaddicted 's use phrase, ""if... then"" mean understood it, spitting food considered biological warfare therefor be. Maybe misunderstood.

There's want quote reading it, think spitting somebody legally supported bioterrorist act.

Selection bias. people sub mostly rich countries pandemic ""over"", meaning nearly everyone wants vaccine gotten one time go back normal. Perfect, succinct, easy understand analogy. vaccines back then. eat kids (Japan) weird, people know got Pfizer side effects, ones somewhat random. One kids old enough vaccinated, got Pfizer like wife did. wife side effects all, teenager fever tired day. actually surprised. I‚Äôve hard heart towards unvaxxed Americans getting sick dying COVID late. passage hit ‚ÄúYou kind go thinking, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôm going feel bad person, make choice,‚Äô‚Äù Cobia said. ‚ÄúBut actually see them, see face face, really changes whole perspective, they‚Äôre still person thinks made best decision could information have, misinformation that‚Äôs really see fear regret. even though may walk room thinking, ‚ÄòOkay, fault, yourself,‚Äô leave room, see person that‚Äôs really suffering, regretful choice made.‚Äù

I still think they‚Äôre fucking dumbasses, touch compassion feeling before.  That's true: unvaccinated monolithic block. media organizations like Fox certain public figures keep telling get vaccine, that's listen to. parents refuse get vaccinated, line second available me. oversimplification say decisions based environment grew nothing more.  Yeah believe you‚Äôll get people always give sort excuse, however legitimate amount people truly waiting fda approval getting it.  lot wrong statement. virus get dangerous Delta. reproductive number increased. Big difference. Viruses generally tend get ""deadlier"" time, did, around tell them. lot discussion main page /r/COVID19. Feel free give read. lot people much smarter us.

And still completely ignoring point many us little kids home unvaccinated. read cloth masks offer least amount protection. others, seemed similar playing field. Like disposable medical masks. see seems like lot waste produced understand we're going thru difficult period is. People using straws plastic shopping bags forever...so keep bay bit. N95's best think good general use long periods time that's also costly. I've looked different talks it. worship here...I went looking see best mid-range safety money was. plus, like reuse mask seems gross unsanitary general. change undies change mask. dad died Covid (four weeks shy 100th B-Day) NURSE asked (via email) put Covid death certificate. said cascade age-related causes. said, ""Well, doctors lying death certificate order make Trump look bad."" asked mom's death certificate mom died thing. stroke Covid person going let personal experience, let alone facts, interfere beliefs. (No - vaccinated yet.) appears Covid reach them‚Ä¶ sometimes, call stories ‚ÄúCCP propaganda / MSM lies‚Äù recycled tripe go spouting nonsense. Good points. meant add difference federal law state laws. yes, federal level, least, they'll interested act meant harm one individual. state decide otherwise. Whether COVID may change that, we'll see, generally one one event treated differently. states appears option. Given world unvaccinated, mean Delta end pandemic? Conservatism plague. also got rejected low risk. 

They looking choices risk job was, age, preexisting conditions.

There's use testing efficacy someone works home fairly young high risk health factors. much better see works someone likely get exposed Entertainment places one day restricted fully vaccinated valid medical reason vaccinated, many outside children right now. would set generous deadline like starting next year it. convince holdouts get vaccinated. 2020? That's sooo last year/s  Probably hard prove court, runs freedom press, otherwise, sure, lawyers would go it. people encouraged people get vaccine ...but they're not. live New York they're even enforced places. Subway mask compliance plummeted. Indeed, Covid exist governor dictator, know? ;) 48% US fully vaccinated, plus 12 population, plus population got 1 2 doses far. 
Some may deferred vaccinations medical reasons still plan completing course.
I want add, *can should* get vaccinated, immunocompromised, may working well weren‚Äôt, depends individual. temporarily immunocompromised, discuss timing vaccination doctor. Seatbelts useless....until flying windshield... Pretty sure got California Adventure (sister park Disneyland) last week. us party careful - wore masks, washed hands, used hand sanitizer, etc. didn‚Äôt wear masks actual rides, though, I‚Äôm kicking - guessing people screaming often confined space (thanks, Tower Terror) it. time, figured get it, would big deal. Whoops. contracts require teachers get lunch without students. school cover lunches classrooms? might see situations suburb X (or even finer granularity) asked wear masks go curbside/takeout 2-3 days contact tracing quarantine takes place.

I could see happening Western countries, America rarely, ever, going happen. Yep. friends refusing vaccinate even tests. seeing while. Hoping see light seem head filled consipiracy theories both.. one knows exactly, even experts, I'm expert. personal thought UK numbers make sense imply pretty good efficacy. US numbers imply *insanely high* efficacy.

But back-of-the-napkin efficacy stats based assume vaccinated unvaccinated people behave same, like double blind clinical trial. Obviously real life.

My guess unvaccinated people US mingle together countries less likely take precautions. example, maybe unvaccinated people UK (who middle-aged older thus likely hospitalized) predominantly people allergic deathly afraid side effects they're likely still masking avoiding crowds. Perhaps unvaccinated people US simply think covid big deal take precautions whatsoever. that's true, would massively skew hospitalization % numbers. would laughed told enjoy dying alone. going believe? abusive jerkoff covid denier deathbed staff member? He's one encouraged idiots get vaccine. Remove politicians board. doctor medical field, pound sand. Even vaccinated I‚Äôm trouble figuring responsible choices are. vacation huge group people starting tomorrow, month ago excited want bail. We've really needed George Carlin's voice past years. simple precautions shit wipe covid though Except much Southern part. Recently told parents I'd rather spend eternity Hell cool people. 'on deathbed scared trying grasp repention judgmental people' flipped God abandoning brother killed terrible bringing scoring 2 life sentences non violent crime.

I feel like model hold well vaccines. mentally spoiled child rich individualistic nation, easy disbelieve anything don‚Äôt like. Anything disagree fake. doctor fake. patients fake. It‚Äôs lie. mental recycle bin it. think problem lies mainly AZ possibly J&amp;J. AZ already know protection limited. J&amp;J results mixed (good immune response antibody levels lower).

Most people know lived 90s living pretty good life 70s 80s. last 5, maybe 10 years rough. people know died 50s 60s (particularly obesity related causes death) still rough 5 10 years end life. agree good least got vaccine, man bar low Unfortunately people seem fine ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt gotten sick year!‚Äù Personally I‚Äôll take getting cold twice year means actually see friends faces suffocate gym. though. That's Spanish flu, get comparing covid Spanish flu a) different virus b) we're already vaccinating people keep doing, also really want compare graph covid little spike March 2020, huge one November 2020, another one March/April 2021 3 already. Yeah Singapore things make tenable. Like masking.

I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs good comparison. Obesity much complicated phenomenon ""Get free injection, die"". likely time 2024 we'll still seeing headlines like these. mean us still wearing masks encountering closed things 2024.

True. might end happening small outbreaks international travelers return less vaccinated places perhaps unknowingly bring something (because they're vaccinated, asymptomatically) spread vulnerable local communities. might see situations suburb X (or even finer granularity) asked wear masks go curbside/takeout 2-3 days contact tracing quarantine takes place. would hopefully small scale, vaccinated people fairly safe. We're find safe.

This kind Australia - short localized lockdowns masking tamp initial spread. barely intelligence Covid virus Worse religion - team sports. grew religious slowly grew it. Detroit Lions fan and... fuck Green Bay Packers matter what.

That's politics now. Red team vs Blue team. Whatever team best fuck team I'll never change mind. Blue team likes vaccines? I'm team Red fuck vaccines. Repost  Yes. Try teaching kids read teaching kids special needs mask- incredibly difficult it‚Äôs already difficult job. even mention need full facial expressions teaching connection, empathy communication. agree it‚Äôs ‚Äújust mask‚Äù comes younger kids. It‚Äôs important conversation thinking full effects masking kids don‚Äôt get voice.

I understand many parents scared despite low risk. it‚Äôs something needs considered. teachers get lunch? dolt.   estimate state numbers, 60.1% seven-county Twin Cities metro area least one dose means 1.25M people metro yet initiated vaccination (including kids). seven counties account half state population.

Likewise, 48.2% rest state initiated vaccination, means 1.3M people outside metro yet initiated vaccination. take Olmsted County (Rochester) that, vaccination rate drops 47.1% 1.25M unvaccinated.  Thank clarifying! wife's organization similar requirement allowed staff submit exception request getting vaccinated. 1% exceptions approved. official messaging gave impression without vaccine approved exception, would let go (if full remote work approved position). must it. Thanks explanation. Daily hospitilizations right noe UK 1/4 first-wave peak, increasing 40% per week. 

They lower fraction cases without vaccines, mild cases happening. 

Also, I'm hoping Western countries advantage widely use astra zeneca, unlike UK. People fully vaccinated AZ something like 2.5x vulnerable symptomatic infection Delta vaccinated Pfizer (efficacy 88% Pfizer vs. 67% AZ according recent [Public Health work). Although efficacy hospitilization within (large) confidence bounds. 

This could helping drive infection rates England despite high aparent vaccination rate, since something like 55% fully vaccinated people got AZ. personal choice . people get marching orders high. much individuality Borg worth noting fair number vaccinated people catch Delta variant, many unvaccinated, fewer get seriously ill it, far fewer die it. anti-vaxers seizing fact several countries seeing many vaccinated infections, ignore big difference outcomes vaccines make. actually, mean one accounted deaths 4 million people worldwide, ""more epidemic 20th 21st centuries"". stay safe.

These things masks either beneficial sense. porous cloth massive holes. Like using fishing net catch minnow. work wet damp, hour typical school day. Yeah pure theatre slightly helpful active coughing, kids sent right home hopefully even show covid times. 

Mask cost best practise way quite expensive. Could run hundred month per kid kill ocean process resulting waste.  ability limit mobility, also ability force everyone get tested outbreak area. enforced isolation government facilities / hospitals test positive, there's limited household transmission.

This means restrictions mobility restrictions required short periods time quickly eliminate virus outbreak detected. lockdowns lifted pretty soon start.

It's impressive, really. could adopt system almost effective eliminating covid, without surveillance tracking movements. mean‚Ä¶ we've endured long months lockdown many countries. much worse people China go comes pandemic restrictions, constant surveillance tracking terrible (but existed even pandemic hit China). sticking around forever.

 unvaccinated, going worse that's choice. everyone else, mild cold/flu, like get every year, gotten every year. people talking immunocompromised/etc. whatever small group people can't get vaccinated, well what's end game that? Another year lockdown? think effects mental health/suicides going that? think effects economy going that? 40,000 people die year influenza, wearing masks/social distancing last 100+ years. definitely spread disease unknowingly past manner.

In camp like odds better? well known rate vaccination Australia based supply Pfizer receiving massive jumps supply shortly. rate remain constant.

I'm cooper cougar üëå

But years ago. I'm 56 üòÅ That‚Äôs fully vaccinated, one dose 55%

We outnumber them. one arguing pandemic going go away ""on take several years deployed point existing virus likely start dying own

I'm pointing need continue pursue vaccinations since wait &amp; see gotten infection rates down. delusion. Covid Zero temporary strategy vaccination hit high enough level stop exponential growth. strategy huge data backing up. NZ done best highest public satisfaction best economic outcomes developed world. 

No country plans forever, best way keep things normal time vaccinate. Australia NZ made deals buy enough vaccines cover whole population 4-5 times over. made deals August-October 2020. Mass vaccination countries begins next couple months. saying they're getting they're free? RIGHTS FREEDOM?!???!? 

/trumpsheepsarcasm many people tempted move based community's response COVID?

\- US Southern lot Delta volunteers. kills dad too. amount people moving Florida accelerating? -Gov NJ, probably Why? Studies shown 90% antibodies 8 months. cell memory plays role. It‚Äôs good vaccine it‚Äôs still well 50% immunity still higher 60% AstraZenece's original efficacy considered good enough UK they‚Äôve survived actual case they‚Äôll natural immunity least while. keep hospital. stats Covid wins Florida! one city. commenter Perth spent couple weeks lockdown outside restrictions packed nightclubs everything, unlike countries. yet, might go so. really hoping breakthrough infections rare wouldn‚Äôt lose sleep past weeks made rethink bit. 

Thank well wishes! go vacation? See parents? Enjoy concert? Remember option return, forceful return. Apple brand lot lose force employees return sparks outbreak. There's outside chance outbreak spawns new, dangerous variant too. Nothing really gain forcing return, frankly ever. That‚Äôs thing. ‚ÄúForced implement‚Äù said, ‚Äúwe to.‚Äù

Vaccine ‚Äúpassports‚Äù don‚Äôt exist, that‚Äôs vaccine cards give get shot for. Yeah bad thing though Pfizer's study showed something like 90% effectiveness delta variant. countries showing actually effective (perhaps Pfizer bit biased study) CDC needs reevaluate recommendations. rare all. think six Democratic lawmakers got infected single airplane ride (everyone vaccinated)? Delta spreads readily people vax'd not. rare hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated. Vaccine so-so blocking Delta spread, effective preventing actual sickness. None plane load actually symptoms.

The danger vaccinated Covid them...but might others spread at-risk people. gotten antibody test? might put mind ease risk level. believe get booster shot antibodies low also. hope in-law ok feel better. Works fine NZ. community case lockdown since February August 2020. blame Zero Covid strategy itself. Australia failing carry effectively that's issue. government's looking zero cases cost billions dollars small businesses closing permanently.

Australia done better economically developed countries. retail open continuous restrictions 18 months. one countries can't leave go overseas.

I agree that's crazy. Even NZ lets citizens leave want. see policy helps anyone.  Ya, seriously question ""cold/allergies"" couple weeks ago past fully vaccinated date actually COVID. Hit wife along daughter.

My taste off, sure why. was, good vaccine. ran 10 KM every day sick, addiction. impacted me, much would thought.  Yeah, definitely put faith real-world Data, especially see kind sample sizes. someone got J+J, little spooky first Well, mine‚Ä¶the federal government‚Äôs interpretation. yeah, that‚Äôs meant. There's chance getting sick vaccine. bit higher J&amp;J two (for strains, Delta).

But vaccine extremely well make sure recover illness quickly without experiencing hospitalization severe, life-altering effects. 

In words, Covid like another cold you. vaccinated hang others can't get vaccinated, relax. never eradicated spread always continue insane? Yup think it, still mask whenever I‚Äôm indoors. ""Clearly COVID-19 US, spread Delta variant means summer surge many states followed likely larger surge late fall winter."" 
    
‚Äî University Washington - IHME COVID-19 - Policy [Briefings](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates) - [United States](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/2021/102_briefing_United_States_of_America_29.pdf) - July 14, 2021 - pg.1, par.2, ln.20 (download: [pdf file](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/2021/102_briefing_United_States_of_America_29.pdf)). wHaTsApP fOrWaRdEr DESTROYED faCtS LoGiC installed one two months ago. SHIT!

But seriously. awesome. Two things true once. Vaccine works like charm still chance (albeit smaller degree 70-80%) spread others. 

People latching onto want responsible infecting someone's grandparent, parent, child, sibling, etc. shitty situation really tell people gamble well-being Delta spreading like crazy live . allowed get 1st vaccine next month due age . Really worrying . get flu shot either. see mean. oh, many medical providers also unvacc'ed, perfect marriage, thinks :) I'm sure part case. may schools, Iceland good comparison nearly 80% fully vaccinated rolling-day case average severity disease appear lower

Unfortunately certainly case. Every country vaccinating vulnerable seen moderate-to-large drop CFR result (2% 0.2% UK, 2% 1% US), good news. Delta's severity shows 1.5-3.3x deadly classic strain (and well ahead alpha/beta/gamma). wonder knows suffered COVID.... excellent Delta hopscotching hitting low-vax regions hardest. Even SoCal neighborhoods hit herd immunity others still outbreaks. region fairly vaxxed probably safest time see friends &amp; go dinner/movies. virologists fear US may mirror Israel wider breakthrough cases senior population head fall vaccine efficacy diminishes time. almost certainly will, [group - it'll start slow like mask mandate described linked article expect everything else follow due course next months. least American (I assume) small breath normality regression, rest us lucky, I'm expecting even proper concerts/events go foreseeable future (i.e. probably next year least, likely even longer). curious, matter parents everyone Faux News vaccinated? Natural thought process. see deaths first hand end day, do? Wear mask, wash hands distance. even then, people sick too. We're stage becoming acceptance. vaccine passport next step. got J&amp;J vaccine April 2021. started feel cruddy yesterday morning. got COVID test morning. Positive. sucks. I‚Äôve wearing masks everywhere since early 2020 got vaccine soon eligible. Oh yay, we're completely utterly fucked. Yep. US way ahead Canada vaccination rates long time, weeks ago Canada passed US first doses given, sometime past week passed US full vaccinations, too.

The reason: politics. largely non-political Canada. political parties fully support vaccination. Canadian study barely included Indian variant. can‚Äôt used judge efficacy it.  I'm neccesarily agreeing guy, since I'm vaccinated followed protocol ready get back things (and wedding October) hes technically correct. way ensure unvaxxed people wear masks requiring everyone wear it. honor system clearly work (shocker) point say thin herd anyway. guaranty variant would arise this, would rooting unvaccinated catch it. Serves people right prolonging mess. 52% - 64% effective depending vaccine get‚ÄîPfizer around 52% mark first dose, AstraZenica 64%. it‚Äôs also important note current thinking protection fades lot faster 1 dose.  Oddly enough, TV show IIRC. radio show, larger audience, anti-vaxx shit. 

But seems Fox tv personalities pushing pro-Vax narrative. Don‚Äôt get wrong, fucking finally, really want know it. states (mine) let win. 
They end meat crayons. people getting Moderna Pfizer two doses Novavax? (which equally, more, effective?)  Mask wearing panacea believe be. Vaccines, hand, appear be. That's pretty much I'm saying. I'm saying useless, point think there's one vaccine standing retaining high efficacy Delta standard infections. parents like us boat. don‚Äôt want kids getting covid. Coronavac approved Singapore, hence people got counted *unvaccinated* official stats. Read! 3.7 million people received least one dose Pfizer Moderna vaccines, covering 65% July 3, 17,000 people received one dose CoronaVac

The Coronavac reluctantly made available China citizens (who difficulties returning home without China vaccine) die-hard anti-mRNA seniors. * study based nABS (neutralizing antibodies) known part immune response. There's action B cells study go looking into.
* based incredibly small number people, representative, 
* based labs results real-world efficacy.

Even though study fair appropriate, early conclusion, even adding ***may be***, plain fear-mongering clickbaity. study even peer-reviewed. People putting much responsibility variant completely ignoring human behavior. Yes, evidence pointing increased transmissibility much world, despite countries, type lockdowns hard restrictions. countries even restrictions all. behavior prone generating cases. glory, **all vaccines** market showing effective preventing even greater disaster. 

We'll probably eradicate Covid short term. vaccines work. immune response limited anti-bodies. Fox viewers must zero ability retain information.  Laugh Australian. know bars LA requiring proof vaccination/negative test enter premises. wonder large venues like stadiums &amp; arenas would willing implement screening could resume tours &amp; shows? I'm sure smaller venues &amp; theaters would love anything get back business. think really depends sentiment particular state. It‚Äôs way around. Vaccine sites picked prevalent COVID be. That‚Äôs clinical efficacy data collected, compare placebo test group infection rates. taking place, let‚Äôs say, New Zealand, would still waiting results.  Great Read, even beyond comprehension, find extraordinary first paper number researchers etc it. reminded antivaxers use one doctor etc going anti vax etc, take gospel. 69% one dose 54% fully vaccinated yes  brother lives got Pfizer wife another Spanish friend got J&amp;J Idk it‚Äôs weird. still 8000 people getting first doses every day NJ 0.1 percent population. people hardcore anti vaxxers would wager aren‚Äôt. top 10-15 percent still eligible based age still 20 percent eligible people gotten vaccine. I‚Äôd imagine maybe like half people may willing get vaccine hard tel. Yes lot parents sending kids school awaiting Covid test result, kids Covid riding bus, staff family members live positive come school, name it‚Äôs happening school. got back next week mask mandate, social distancing encouraged, possibly one lowest vaccinated counties state.   Saw cnbc jj weak delta. Ok I‚Äôm really scared. news talking new study J&amp;J isn‚Äôt effective Delta Variant. weeks ago J&amp;J released data effective Delta.

Am safe not? frustrating. got J&amp;J high risk person encouraged get first vaccine available me. state allowed people w/ health condition get early March, showed appointment found spot J&amp;J. supposed do, leave? 

I‚Äôm tired living constant anxiety doubt. Science field method inquiry. 

That said, recommendations run contrary know Covid, vaccination, hospitalization rates. fully vaccinated. medical systems mask recommending counties danger overwhelmed. Case numbers up, appears vaccines working keeping deaths hospitalizations manageable levels. Vaccines remain available free comers. ineligible--those 12--remain largely resistant Covid.

I wearing mask wish answer... lol Ding ding ding - Dr. Fox decided would good idea. One dose? Holy shit That‚Äôs great start! Hopefully everyone‚Äôs sake continues. really? think we're seeing Delta virulent strain capable breakthrough infections vaccines remained incredibly robust preventing severe illness death. hospital needs give reasonable notice accommodate opt mRNA vaccine.

This timeline set lawyers maximize chances winning inevitable lawsuits think right endanger patients. Methodist prevailed Texas mean Banner Arizona.

They almost certainly also trying time full FDA approval within two months negate argument getting it. Maybe told vaccine also protected 5g, they'd take it! see figures reported. adult figure important understanding uptake targets, especially since UK vaccinated teens yet population figure important calculating things like herd immunity understanding spread.

I know cause confusion put adults title, I've seen sort figure reported headline context even confusing. carrot stick? Good. hope spreads like fire. antivax crowd antibodies come join herd. shame hard way.  Stop bragging! think you. would look % people vaccinated area, positivity rate. decide risk tolerance. things simple... :/ hierarchy puts masks higher vaccines. That‚Äôs gripe  Less insane, cruel haters. Keep mind pathogen survive multiple species continue survive, spread even thrive even [exterminate long hosts. 

This virus hosts. Yeah tried include link numbers paywall. Can't vouch source numbers right. Agreed. focus freedoms. fail realize certain ""freedoms"" illegal specifically ability live free tyranny exercise theirs.

They seem like idea ""strong preys weak"" find stand pecking order.

This differentiates actual libertarian ""murrika-tarian"" politics. sound like one people Fauci sign yard.

Be careful idolizing powerful people. know media propped Fauci anti -Trump, guy beyond reproach openly lied American people masks. Also important: looking anti-body neutralization looking real world efficacy numbers? big difference. I‚Äôm paywalled too. Thanks, that's interesting. would think outbreak linked unvaccinated School Children probably supports American Academy Pediatrics, CDC recommendations unvaccinated students wear masks Schools. trust people devoted entire lives researching viruses vaccines, unless there‚Äôs evidence contrary believe it. I‚Äôd wager 25% rural America isn‚Äôt even getting plane train


Make mandatory attend college football game California checking in. schools mask required regardless vaccinated not. Thats least last week.. may changed since. 

My oldest going 2nd grade youngest kindergarten. oldest problem mask, youngest wearing mask goes since March last year. muh ""da cUR HArMful dan Da deezeez"" honest question. masks accomplish? mission?

Delta seems transmissable get COVID 0? 

Attack statement- Delta spread-able exposed difference vax prior. Unless live cave find you. -   least got it. forget get second shot really need second shot. Many scientists believe possible covid mutate completely evade mRNA vaccines would render spike protein infection mechanism useless. 7 5 year old begging us let get vaccinated can. wont allow things like dance ballet vaccinated. 

My wife fully vaccinated still wear masks everywhere go, try stay home much keep kids safe Thanks setting straight, case fair play good folks Wales also. never understand this. see maybe 10% even logical decisions there's stupid factor, really depressing race. viruses. Big ol' FU companies forcing people back office nothing.

Remote work allows feel little bit better grind things corporate world. let us one thing. discussion anti-vaxxer twitter (I know) come across tidbit: AZ tested UK, Brazil, South Africa India; main variants developed. 

Do know why? nothing convince people can't reasoned with, think natural try distance horror.  0.021% fully vaccinated people develop covid all. .0015% fully vaccinated people end hospital.

Your tenses off. need helping verb ""have"" -ed. 0.021% fully vaccinated people developed covid all. .0015% fully vaccinated people ended hospital

That's read drastically changes meaning sentence. I'm gonna call doctors office tomorrow. Hopefully they'll able help phone 300k die year US due obesity related complications. It‚Äôs actually fairly similar Covid since half country acts like pointing obesity bad heinous crime Ugh. gf convinced get vaccine ""infertility"" (she heard ood news). get bad anxienty work night shifts trouble sleeping even weekends soon I'm get it, COVID. really hope I'm okay......

Am fearvmobgering ed scares shit - I'm 20..... know Moderna pretty far along variant booster, believe started trial delta variant.

Any idea long might information booster's efficacy delta variant? *Reduce chance spread reduce viral load transmission going vaccination site, get shot! That's good news, here's hoping! Yeah really unpleasant, especially comes quickly. One minute fine, hours later leaking uncontrollably ends üôà feeling source misreporting mangling facts. one thing, news source reporting seemingly dramatic finding, seems odd.

Second, consistent news articles Israel efficacy findings countries.

Third, possible measure decline efficacy virus changing, levels herd immunity changed dramatically demographics changed dramatically?

Of course, older people vaccinated earlier pandemic likely get covid, even vaccinated, younger people vaccinated recently. way measure decline efficacy would control factors.

It's hard say numbers come from. sound credible. 10 person 80% female. antibodies. beta numbers antibodies test don‚Äôt explain it‚Äôs better average effectiveness beta variant phase 3. Good job Scotland! I‚Äôm convinced current obsession vaccinated people wearing mask stems us using mask metric determine whether someone cared pandemic. in, 2020 somebody wearing mask easily identified someone ‚Äúthe wrong side‚Äù speak. vaccines mask mandates dropping, don‚Äôt visual cue anymore think subconsciously upsets people. 20 7 day average case count ~2400. Currently 42k per day 20 7 day average hospitalization 116. north 600 rising (lagged growth behind 20 7 day average deaths 6. 36 rising (lagged growth behind hospitalizations)

At point would call following, following? different percentage raw numbers alone still grow big state is, something like 3 paved roads leaving it? Put police barricades 3 places one get easily land. know basically saying masks restrictions forever logic, though, right? highly unlikely COVID *ever* goes away completely. Abbott tests proven unreliable? Also, many children debunked retracted ""study"" sent lawyer looking sue vaccine manufacturers. total con man. first row data uses different divisor second would almost never add 100%. 1st dose efficacy highly important right undervaccinated countries encountering delta. Also, looking ahead..  important countries may consider moving ""mixed vaccine"" strategy - particularly light waning humoral response Pfizer. unlikely FDA consider anytime soon mixing already happening Europe. really true could see total FDA authorization vaccines within month two? That's earlier expected.

Also, happened Moderna's statement would able manufacture revised vaccines instance escape variant? Since heard claim revisited, I'm assuming *may* longer true? article also states still incredibly effective preventing serious illness death. We're going come terms fact catch COVID point lives. vaccinated likely asymptomatic cold symptoms. unvaccinated bad flu symptoms get straight pneumonia and/or die. Eventually, everybody gets form immunity, COVID morph seasonal illness similar cold. virus never go away. contagious widespread many anti vaxers combined third world countries likely never access widely available vaccine. would Australia suddenly widespread disobedience despite world much tougher restrictions last year? current spike, vaccinated get infected experience mild illness, supposed still living constant state anxiety fear next 6 months? comes next surviving ‚Äúdelta‚Äù, speak? mechanisms work antibodies it‚Äôs real world results better beta study would suggest.

Wait, fighting global warming? Last heard, one side still calling ‚ÄúChinese hoax.‚Äù Well everyone would screaming would say everyone would wear regardless vaccination status. way, gave honest answer, that. Let insurance companies deny coverage covid related medical expenses eligible unvaccinated people Actually said Virginia site appears one 27 deaths vaccinated site software bug screws particular selection. definitely deaths among fully vaccinated since many extremely old even mild case kill them. Mandate vaccines masks doesn‚Äôt make sense. You‚Äôd say age maybe comorbidities. None released names think know dosing schedule. 

The issue giving proper notice, inevitable follow-up vaccinated termination. remember seeing place full similar studies world last summer look important numbers feel frustration brother. Believe me. read entire comment relate. Boy I‚Äôve stupid people year all/most 8% older folks? It‚Äôs part failure morality education too. It‚Äôs like trolley problem, lots people don‚Äôt think inaction positive decision. positive action getting vaccine weighed independent moral weight, though decision isn‚Äôt risk chance virus (both anyone spread to) vs. risk chance vaccine. words [youtube news/politics commentator find part failure constantly framing things terms personal rights, personal responsibilities. *can‚Äôt* me, vs. *must* you.   get second dose denied questioned get 21/28 days later? dad got Pfizer month second dose scheduled first week august, however, got pfizer booster case wants travel europe future since vaccine part european vaccine passport, already 2 doses different vaccine get US (and doctor gave okay get third shot pfizer mainly delta) planning getting second dose pfizer 21 days later, asked pharmacist gave first dose said get 6 weeks max know would cause problems tried get second dose september something since also already plans next month can't travel (we us) till prob september.

I'm genuinely starting believe ""herd immunity"" never achievable.

lol Thank you! Totally agree. two kids 12. Since wife gotten shots, we've gotten mostly back normal great. awesome summer. Kids catch covid, risk realistically much different seasonal flu. still think they‚Äôre fucking dumbasses, touch compassion feeling before.

I think quoted doctors response/compassion comes professional obligation help, Hippocratic Oath that, real sense obligation. Plus they're really used dealing lots unpleasant side effects tragically bad decisions gotten judgement phase.

You ability help people chosen remain unvaccinated. nothing point. may tried, picture now, harder much compassion.

I still try, though. I've witnessed one person dying, seeing fear eyes last minutes really F'ed pretty hard.

Sadly, many them, identity expertly woven ""news"" sources Red team, break feels like abandoning entire world view values.

This true, course, one ever blindly follow one side, feels ensnared cult.  blame people reaction? Especially ones may high risks may feel functioning immune system? mean, sure protection 2 doses mRNA fairly high, perfect. Many people need see working feel actually safe. Which, imo, perfectly understandable. Yes.

The old ""I'm mad, disappointed"" method. 

Sometimes, appealing people emotional level effective attempting reason them. need embarrassment. regardless took, got ... strength. bad. Higher viral load often associated worse outcomes.

Seriously, people need get vaccinated aren't. least give bodies chance Delta. Destroy public education system able recognize misled. also knew speaking publicly.

I know bunch doctors, ill say that, record, compassion completely gone 16 month burn-out, really stopped giving shit non-vaccinated people dying. get vibe unofficially put less effort treating too.  terrifying. I'm fucking happy live state everyone getting vaccinated really returning normal, wonderful!! 

Then see this...these people going keep living Covid CHOICE?? they're going breed new variants cause rest us go back living like that! 

Can draw border, fence it, quarantine whole fucking region? love Covid much keep it, want live fear South apparently really fucking stupid. made best decision could information have, misinformation that‚Äôs there. 

And still feel sorry people? don't.  know cynical, evidence good tracking variants effect outcomes? UK sequences anyone thing seemed make aware coming bit earlier, still late stop it. variant transmissible, take everywhere. 

I'm saying sequencing useless (though think reporting would much improved talk much variants went ""the virus surging"" lot time), really hiding new variant gains transmission advantage. agree certain things can't order keep others safe. can't drive drunk speed. can't shoot guns air. can't start forest fires poison drinking water. actions illegal protect public safety.

Refusing vaccine considered another entry list. willingly endanger public safety, get charged crime go jail. Sure. give time forced agree, also think it‚Äôs huge failure part current medical industry. Doctors usually 10-15 minutes patient lot time questions. So, people already used resort internet get lot medical formation, makes sense would vaccine too. Like, many times people go doctor get prescribed medication, receive printout detailed information including dietary lifestyle changes hardly get talked appointment? Or, unless don‚Äôt know questions ask, won‚Äôt get much information all. It‚Äôs really wonder people don‚Äôt think go doctor first medical questions. Psychopath

Well, suppose people true empaths there. they're severe minority.  coughing months difficulty breathing. tired longest time. makes wearing ppe even worse. relieved second dose basically little dream world. Music sounded better, soda tasted better, sun seemed brighter, etc. Maybe really really good mood. Vaccination providing 50-60% protection Delta variant according best information available. Pulling back easy restrictions employment locations mean severe restrictions pandemic returns vengeance. mask difficult?  precautions take immunocompromised family member covid? wearing masks back then? US, 40% people accepted it. ridiculous. another major wave.  That‚Äôs generalization. every person doesn‚Äôt want get vaccine throwing fit masks past year. step mom doesn‚Äôt want get vaccine cause she‚Äôs allergic lot different things worried allergic something vaccine.

Dr. Scumbag.  Please feel free share studies support statement  somewhere between. Nothing black white, collection probabilities. vaccine efficacy numbers average across whole study population much lower average chance getting covid across vaccinated participants unvaccinated participants.

You can't map directly reduction provides one person. vaccine effectiveness individuals kind probability distribution. probably lowers risk people (like comorbidities, young, good immune system) like 99%, people (old, obese, immune-compromised cancer patient) like 20%.

Protect let ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù step get infection. least they‚Äôre getting cold flu season fall. Anti masking talk needs banned sub. another version anti-vax that's somehow ok spout.

Vaccines important tool box need applied readily, two tools: masks &amp; peer pressure.

It ok someone vaccinated point people need feel that. ok wear masks middle epidemic tool studies shown cut infection rates half.

You build working systems one fail safe. build many redundant safety mechanisms. called safety redundancy. one tactic fails, one kicks mitigate consequences.

We three tools: vaccines, masks peer pressure. like masks use third one best ability end pandemic already. meantime, vax rate area 90% infections rising, need wear mask. Thing is, getting vaccinated may late lot people since immunity takes time develop.  there'll whole, ""See, got shot work"" bullshit. worth, local shopping centre supermarket majority people still wearing masks. ""nose mask"" people must unmasked really see anymore. company work flat allow masks even asks visitors (save old ladies dropping things etc) wear them. Full denial everything since day 1.

(Yeah yeah know report it/get different job. simple.) disagree, think percentage points would make huge difference, even 1 person fully vaccinated means less chance get virus pass on. agree masks must go point it‚Äôs right moment now, yes 70% fully vaccinated may good goalpost herd immunity ‚Äònormal‚Äô strain COVID, delta variant means even higher number needed, scientists saying 80% 85%. comment younger people exactly virus spreading way is, it‚Äôs mostly younger adults haven‚Äôt access doses yet (meaning recently considered fully vaccinated), engaging settings lot un/under-vaccinated young people (bars, clubs) meaning spreads quite easily. idealistic view extreme old age time people good health play grandchildren heart problem; honest conversation received assumption LE needs *as long possible costs* necessitates confronting reality many elderly people‚Äôs lives actually like increasingly atomized ‚Äî ageing ‚Äî society.

What's science behind this? sub crazy. largest vaccination drive since polio NoThInG DoNe!!!!!! Regarding mask mandates, yes could still imposing certain places good idea, however I've seen week London majority people still sensible wearing enclosed spaces, still legal requirement wear London public transport

As waiting bit percentage points, public already waited, re-opening originally meant 21st June. Sure could waited bit coincides schools going back, hits flu season viruses colds norovirus

Deaths still incredibly low thanks vaccine, see better alternative accepted public honest I‚Äôve always wondered happens kids become vaxxed continue big surges unvaccinated people? admittedly say we‚Äôre selfish protecting kids must everything reasonable protect (continue masks, limiting indoor capacity etc)? finally becomes acceptable end game?

So guess logic get double jabbed, might still get covid, going much lower risk do. can‚Äôt normal before? Pretty much everything open requirements. least person learned getting vaxxed. people whose spouse died covid still refuse jab. stop spread prevent hospitals overwhelming, also breakthrough cases much common delta don‚Äôt want get sick.

The question many brainless self-centered idiots need something someone tell asshole. think number much higher seem to, assume majority critical thinking skills. Yes, show covid bit deadly pneumonia. science says vaccines still incredibly good reducing hospitalisation transmission. Ok, go 56% still leaves 44% unvaccinated. getting 23%?  That‚Äôs trade off. Lockdown rough mom too. She‚Äôs retired, dad still works, even working home, busy home office, really lonely bored stuck house basically alone day. She‚Äôs much happier go lunch friends again. make difference though 

My grandma intubated weeks, removed yesterday still ICU. several comorbidities, beat cancer five times one kidney. would *not* made far without vaccines 48% *fully* vaccinated, roughly 15% population (children 12, immunocompromised) can't even get it. Probably little efficiently COVID tears culls folks. society cant learn anyone kind, gross. watched infant alone day second shot. bad side effects. excuses. understanding figure many people need vaccinated function contagious (Ro) disease is.

So, 70% acceptable original covid, delta contagious (greater Ro), need even people vaccinated able ""stop it"".

To make math interesting, effective vaccine also role. too! It‚Äôs hard figure aren‚Äôt board saying thing I‚Äôve read others. first thought it‚Äôs stock market/economy, thought threatened loss followers. Let‚Äôs face it: they‚Äôre killing base off.

Sounds right. There's also reasonable assumption made 5.5% positives brink death either; there's wide degree symptoms possible within ""testing positive"". Good thing Covid isn‚Äôt big deal, otherwise we‚Äôd get vaxxed!  line first day age able get vaccinated. lot failed people America accepting responsibility figure maybe studied harder, ran business better would better spot.

So, thanks that, anti-vaxxers. Nah, kids get BT like everywhere else  Good catch. mixed LA City population Greater Los Angeles land area. guess would need know area Covid numbers get correct comparison. many people virus kills. That's one metric. 

It also puts number people hospital long term effects even people mild cases.

Not mention, catching it, giving virus opportunity mutate spread people. protecting vaccine, protecting everyone come contact well. Thankfully cold hands death  one ever said 100%. prevalent still world, amazing numbers beating efficacy many vaccines people take granted.  reinforce thinking ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äù people. sway thinking there‚Äôs growing sense danger. effect getting increase vaccination. definitely strongly sends message ‚ÄúVax Mask‚Äù end this. lot unvaccinated say ‚ÄúWhy bother‚Äù haven‚Äôt either increased significantly Scotland, downslope delta curve? recall reading mRNA vaccines (simplifying here) bit like Lego sets. Plug play. 

Isn't possible Novavax? It‚Äôs honestly incredible public health officials still don‚Äôt get this. Better cure, wrote book.... Telling someone ""it's late"" intubating proper bedside manner. think consensus kid never autistic ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 Semi-Quant Total Ab‚Äù J&amp;J. don‚Äôt know others. I‚Äôll pack nice lunch. old rampage along sure share sentiment. research he‚Äôs also youngest African American candidate elected legislature U.S., first elected 21 sworn 22. Impressive! originally ran independent, yes runs democrat tell. point empathy well bone fucking dry, nothing left people probably never again. feel cannot vaccinated work health care that? Let nature take course. Send home bottle Tylenol 'thoughts prayers', let Darwin sort out. following Dr. Racaniello's reddit comment two months back. predicted happened. 

Of course, quite understand Israel's number come week half ago. Later confirmed UK number confirmed number. Anyway, personally skip optional gathering since two risk parents home. 

""Those studies done shortly vaccination antibody levels high. year serum mucosal antibody levels low prevent infection. However memory response kick 2-3 days prevent extensive replication, shedding, disease."" 
  Don‚Äôt think he/she US county‚Äôs death rate compared national average? Used work someone adamant allowing family get available vaccines. Probably one reasons i've cut ties company, type person I'd like spend time with. Exactly right. CDC said count hospitalized breakthroughs, first thing thought last couple times didn‚Äôt trust CDC.

Honesty transparency critical. article said last thing intubated beg vaccine, course tell ""Sorry, late now."" son starts kindergarten year I‚Äôm worried, safety possibility online school another outbreak. school system still required masks summer school activities haven‚Äôt made decision fall yet. wonder number positive cases actually dramatically higher Massachusetts. around 85% mask-less yet 300 cases/day now. peak January 4000-6000 cases day. wonder many vaccinated people actually becoming positive, never know symptoms mild non-existent. NZ could conspiracy theories violate laws? Thanks much sharing that! imagine people still work home younger people worried Covid, simply hurry took schedule appointments. know county still thousand people getting vaccinated every day, people still want shot, they've lazy getting it. Same, proceeding on. hope don‚Äôt screw us another lockdown. personally, really leave house atm would like wait long possible getting vaccine 100% approved like vaccines.

That said, go back college 2 months, I'll getting vaccine. context article, yes, pharmacist obviously tell someone get vaccine, except [the occasional nut like one destroyed pharmacist give specific medical advice, health care providers sense.  real problem, would direct people go urgent care ER appropriate. doctor-poor area like rural Alabama problem. Oh snP idea you. know, I'm sure something they're looking said safe side kinda thing. idk. wife pregnant. parents get vaccine, even though told unvaccinated people hold baby. mother says choice whether get vaccinated something ""between doctor"". 

She talked doctor yet. know fact doctor would tell get vaccine. Dam! got us! fake death could help media get ppl vaccinate Also, often lot cases first vaccine two weeks, essentially better unvaccinated (particularly early portion). live mid-west... People stopped wearing masks Summer 2020. MIL said Dr told get vaccine might reaction. never tell truth is, one people believes lies. sick get vax, worry taking Emergen-c everyday.. gets covid done. obese, issues bronchitis. test also N95: 95% effective 0.1-0.3 um particles, physics reasons hardest filter, 99.5% 0.75 um larger. dispersed mouth/nose, individual virus particles agglomerate larger clumps N95s still highly effective.

There lot factors involved tests, important long term exposure flow rate tests conducted lab conditions, abstracting average human respiration. example, whether use 95% optimistic 99% effectiveness number, take account numbers derived passing neutralized aerosol flow rate 85 L/mi, means minute 5% 1% particles make filter, extend time, exposure certainty. 

Now mean average adult whose tidal volume around 500 ml per breath, averages 12 breaths per minute? measure chance exposure breath volume? Add face seal issue, highly dependant flow rate aspiration. 

Lastly, physics behind electrostatically enhanced filters work, fact tested electrostatically neutralized particles, finding [particle charge significant impact really, highly effective mean real world settings? telling one works around toxic aerosols opts N95s.  usually go better fitting, full face respirators, extended exposure PAPR preferred system. Pretty sure first months shit, vitamin deficiency linked worse outcomes. People melanin ‚Äúefficient‚Äù vitD, maintain less within body, think? Anyway remember people straight saying ‚Äúit really kills blacks‚Äù. feel like kushner Stephen miller alluded that. 13 middle school age, considered teen rather child. one elementary school eligible vaccination, means every single child risk. Unless lose someone won‚Äôt care. COVID isn‚Äôt affecting personally scale change stance. Maybe time call health department side? Amazon too. scooped pack last month anticipation fire season. Got vaccinated March. Still wearing mask. Waiting test come back chest cold...  CDC says vaccinated students (who going high school above) wear masks they're vaccinated (i.e. pretty much guidance original announcement May). AAP wants students *all* ages wear masks, matter vaccination status. (Previous comment deleted mean, changed insult compliments would acceptable)

We already vaccination record. ""Carnet de vaccination"" since forever. recent one published coined term vaccine passport *incredibly smart well researched antivaxxers* start foaming mouth. society technology advanced, Darwin stymied. go life America total moron never see life-ending consequences stupidity. 

Until now. great cull approaches. I'm SW Missouri hot bed. Bottom line nobody still safe Delta Variant. annouced 8% vaccinated percent hospital. 

If take Vax get Delta getting worst virus life.

The suffering seem helping little bit vaccination rate.

The worst news heard today state government made illegal mask mandates now. would make worse imagine people would act feel ‚Äúcensored‚Äù. talk streisand effect. 

the real answer publishing 3 things anti vaxer dies

1. Something showing clearly anti vax
2. picture suffering sick quote regret
3. picture dead body Exactly, seem understand this. result celebration hating critical thinking prideful scientific illiteracy. huge problem country. sad reality USA without freely available GP anybody. yeah communism bad /s they're vulnerable _*E N P N T*_ Hbomberguy? great video. Here's link anyone long there's reason it, lots insane things takes explain all. fascinating horrific way. Freedom die laurels.... 
Morons. them. Bill De Blasio saying ""a mask like peashooter vaccine like cannon"" comes Delta variant!

**Get vaxxed haven't.** Yes   ""evil cackle"" award

Great job, Reddit Wrong. Welp... again, get ready bitches. least politics separated enough people die disprove misinformation. dumb education system America.. get. process motion since 1960's. ""We'll teach think critically, it'll cost life time debt acquire 18 never free it. Good luck using ""critical thinking"" skills outside job slaved order loan took ""opportunity."" People charge want think yourself. want listen wisdom get squeezed every piece labor dollar get die. Gotta get 4th yacht expense cancer treatments. start seeing food discounts vaccinated people. I'm still waiting shot, can't get 30% discount donuts free chicken tacos, makes angry.

Therefore, measures works. player wants win also wants leave many pieces standing, would true. there's kind scorched earth, obrain power power's sake mentality infected much modern Red team. seem care anything end reault.  think able partly seems different mentality amongst base (the pawns analogy).  seem willingness / desire suffer harm long others (whom feel deserve help) suffer more.  created weird dynamic base basically saying 'please punch face means people like get punched twice'. Read see nuance made. Maybe don‚Äôt quick jump conclusions. Well, promises promises. can't blame Johnson that. Delta variant major game changer. hope backfire. Fox News started 90s Yup try non-judgemental I'm getting new morbidly obese person, really started... Nice headline there, obviously biased news source. said late vaccine, late help them. Assholes. really hate seeing people dying this, regardless stupid are.

At point though need sleep bed you‚Äôve made, come terms path you‚Äôve chosen. I'm Canadian. posted day would associate unvaccinated people predictably get hurt feeling responses.

Guys, know expected. face tremendous social pressure get vaccinated, particularly Canada. shamed ostracized poor choices. be. also patients die regretting getting vaccine beg can‚Äôt offer data never tested positive similar experience. boyfriend back January never got it. days leading positive test. reason even knew needed test gave piece chocolate fruity pebbles couldn‚Äôt taste it. three tests done span week half, 2 rapid 1 PCR, negative. 

I also exposed three kids unknowingly August 2020. reason tested step father military made test. Never got either, rapid test PCR time think dad would rather arrested get vaccine, can‚Äôt convince like focus almost exclusively breakthrough cases anti-vaxxer‚Äôs dream.

The subtext sentence OK lie suppress information service worthwhile cause.  personally agree this, obviously lot current leaders media figures willing say anything think lead people getting vaccinated.

They realize *real* ammunition anti-vaxxers general loss faith trust leaders, (genuine) realization frequently lie suppress information. catch someone lying you, fool take account say things.

IMO long-term public health strategy works 100% forthcoming cultivate trust population. yet still healthcare workers doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated. good news. According vaccination trackers, _only 1.1% people low-income countries received least one dose._

I wish getting vaccines soon. Damn. Thanks answering. think seeing effect 40 years ""Greed Good"" thinking erosion public institutions. everything perfect then, things definitely different, least US.  reflection human nature. separate tribes, fear don‚Äôt understand. evolved. served us well thousands years, tearing us apart.

My hope see part tribe, team. instead fearing unknown, react curiosity open minds. It‚Äôs really dream though. breakthrough infections, thought well since I'm vaccinated, visit unvaccinated family bring home unvaccinated kids. can't see never vaccinate wait hope okay one day something change meantime, relationship gone. avoid anyone family vaccinated want talk it. would say we've learned lot relationships past year. Sadly, never recover. Sounds like prudent plan. Even hospitalized due breakthroughs much showing effectiveness. mean vastly lower need go ICU, substantially lower ventilator subsequent death, overall va√ßcinated people released much quicker.  lack medical degree doesn‚Äôt make less contagious. countries people required be, are, vaccinated. SW Missouri one hospitals reported 8% vaccinated. 

They starting share numbers.

Still think barely deaths vaccinated. Ya people trot bad action like happens time. doesn't. insane think happening vaccination clinics races line together get shots vials nurses may also black. reasons equally stupid point, excuse. want people thank job they‚Äòre incredibly sick?
Maybe felt bad vibe, would‚Äôve thanked later. Yes yes everything fake dead COVID fake. pastor said vaccine plot mass deaths got COVID almost died fake. jan  distrust authority (and trusting alternative 'sources' more)
  
Of causes mention, one applies experience Germany alternative medicine long legally protected status, personally seen influence homeopathy negatively influence vaccine decisions.  Same. I'm relaxing though. majority guests vaccinated point, there's nothing really do. I've postponed Covid started, lost thousands dollars, etc honestly can't again. I'm vaccinated, fiance vaccinated, bridal party vaccinated, I'm pretty sure guests are. around 70 people honey moon Cabo afterward. honestly can't give life virus. I've done everything can, point, risk spreading thing around low vaccine. can't afford reschedule again, I'm it. things explode month, I'll re-evaluate, right feel comfortable death rates rising much, I've done can. point. makes sense me. 90s parents kept telling never trust anything read internet anyone make stuff up.

Now literally believe anything read FB whatsapp. How?? there's breakthrough case class? class get moved online?

As someone whose spouse departments chair I'll say one clue yet they'll do. unchartered territory. really heartbreaking part. Yes, people chose get vaccinated, also actively lied bad actors turning public health crisis fucking game score political points.

They casualties manipulation. real evil get vaccinated turn around use platforms spread misinformation, gaslight brainwash public. unconscionable. Something also thought about, can‚Äôt force proof vaccination ability also accept negative test result enter ballparks, arenas, concert halls etc? inconvenience getting test every time want attend something crowds would provoke least bunch people get vaccinated. also isn‚Äôt ‚Äúviolating rights‚Äù force vaccinations people gives ability show negative test result, sure make lives difficult avoided simply getting vaccinated.  Yes, right. looked numbers me, seems Delta variant causing breakthrough infections.

When LA County Public Health office posts daily numbers lot comments ""more 99% unvaccinated."" blame people commenting feel county purposely stating percentage breakthrough infections per week. course, kids vaccinated part can‚Äôt be

Really? step-children vaxed oldest turned 13. Someone better go tell they're allowed vaccine them. That's efficacy rate serious disease; catching/spreading it. Israel reporting 60% reduction symptomatic cases among vaccinated population. data asymptomatic cases yet. also Moderna two weeks ago got pretty sick. Sore throat, headache, body aches, exhausted, stuffed sinuses, decreased taste smell. got tested immediately, COVID. 

There nasty upper respiratory illnesses going around. work vaccinated ripping like wildfire.  hope assholes like Robert Kennedy Jr get mailed pictures dying people expressing this. anti-vax movement largely liberal movement (anti-corporate/medical mistrust) decades recently. Oh let tell know feeling fear March spent 30 days hospital eight ICU April spent 7 days late June early July spent 15 days. point I'm really glad I'm least halfway vaccinated (I'm halfway vaccinated they're concerned Guillain-Barre reaction since paraplegic really well understood causes) taking MD weekend who‚Äôs caring COVID patients hospital metro area really high (80%+ eligible population) vaccination rates. current COVID patients unvaccinated, transferred rural areas low vaccination rates. 

She said definitely tendency towards ‚Äúyou yourself‚Äù attitude among healthcare workers, keeps reminding people take care people could prevented disease ‚Äúbetter choices‚Äù time. 

Drug addicts, uncontrolled diabetics, alcoholics, morbidly obese, criminals experience trauma car accidents running police. (Note I‚Äôm making statement ‚Äúmoral equivalency‚Äù cases, they‚Äôre conditions brought kind choice action part afflicted). people deserve compassionate care healthcare setting, even work societal individual level address conditions brought disease. Yup, risking kids start school eclosion stupid get shot.

That decision, unless get actual exemption real doctor, gona let put family risk.  That's right.  Sad. country basic mentally. Florida really isn‚Äôt bad. concentrated pockets idiots you‚Äôll look for. Ok previous comment got deleted I'm glad lot Americans getting doses. really want dose go waste, especially since America produce vaccines giving away hurt America much (given current demand). Asking vaccination already infection says lot thinking process leading situation. biiiiiig difference unlike race, unvaccinated choice (except small number people medical reason vaccinated) - choice puts risk, everyone around well. She‚Äôs answering question‚Ä¶..how would answer it?  Open eyes see world works.

Especially big money involved.

Moderna Pfizer set make billions...... shame everyone wants can't get vaccinated (for various legit reasons), we're stuck dumb shits putting risk. would fine taking out, them, sadly. Stay safe there.  I've good experiences 3m (though ones vent hole) Honeywell.  know could easily fixed local trusted church political leaders started denouncing conspiracy theorists murderous fucks but‚Ä¶ would offend supporters, that‚Äôs scary‚Ä¶ wahwah. Go online get local number police department, call asked speak watch commander. Give name officer happened tell want file formal complaint. Nothing may happen officer now, you‚Äôre helping build paper trail shitty ways. Teacher Arizona k-3 school. mask mandate schools. classes last year quarantined kinder, happened several times. I‚Äôll wearing mask eating outside possible. be. 

Because majority crowd NEEDS read understand this, won't.

It's sad.

In state, we're 54% fully vaccinated seems we'll stop. watched video school board's open forum masking distancing 3 first 5 people got talk made reference ""Marxist agenda"" wearing mask school children... unvaccinated. watch anymore anymore that. think say teachable mean learn watching modeling parents caregivers do. 

For example, children know sleep eat way want it. teach parent.  born ability fumble it, parents intervene order set healthy habits.

I think mean teachable classroom. 


If im understand disconnect here.


Children learn watching parents do.

That teaching, formal teaching classroom.


Now, formal classroom teachers help nurturing empathy well, time kids get (usually age 6) difficult.

I think remember reading something kids go certified daycare young age (4 months on) score higher empathy teachers act caregiver impact age empathy high development.


I'm basically stating nature vs nurture thing psychology. 

We natural traits part human ingrained DNA, born environment nurturing get modify traits dependent environment nurturing. already South African variant (beta?) running around. Nice easy get, didnt even get car. However say numbers dropped much faster wanted, US still giving half million shots average every day looks like delta scared people getting since numbers staying pretty consistent. 

Again, Lower hoped/ wanted 65.8% eligible population least one dose number creeps every day....but also still losing population ever day :( Thanks! I'm Halifax wait two years get GP. Toronto different. Try again. true humans highly susceptible considering others. However, people sees daily.. ones need help... good percentage realize moment amazing caretakers really are. Covid not. Outside environment though.. Many people go back giving second thought.

Well, lot us remember. Heathcare workers saved life once... save lives everyday. promise buy donuts :) actually ""more variants"" - history terrible American approach variant sequencing. usual, story scientists money advocate federal level therefore great sequencing processes existed early days pandemic, actual sequencing still patchy insufficient. lot folks would think, ""hey, know \[do important scientific thing\], surely solve problem!"" actually, grant ""doesn't get reviewed"" ""administrative error"" \[!!!! - that's real outlying event, part work supporting proposal preparation I've never heard thing\] matter good idea is, able even cheapest science costs thousands thousands dollars \*if\* already fully equipped lab.  one article really focuses question additional variants, there's anyway.. people get f****** b******* stats? Half Canadians? remember anyone ever asking opinion. stats always small highly inaccurate. Hell may end true but, information worthless study size. less nothing /r/QAnonCasualties People touch masks time gives false sense security like guy. health experts agreed didn‚Äôt recommend it. places mandated masks, offer data shows policy actually worked. people never learned cope that‚Äôs sad. exactly, types abundant got feel them. do. people like shapiro/fox news making money people feeding lies. smart never prerequisite cop. thing make difference insurance company say give discount people vaccinated, cover treatment Covid unless vaccinated. People would wear seatbelts cars helmets motorcycles insurance company said would refuse coverage situations. would hike premiums roof caught wearing seatbelt. lot people complain government mandate venue requiring entry, completely understand endorse idea private company maximizing profits requirement

The key word: profits  even live Canada man? situation exactly metro Montreal, one Canada‚Äôs populated cities. Reddit moment Apologies silly question but‚Äîif you‚Äôre vaccinated get exposed covid, immune system fights asymptotically, way act booster? Yes too. come something new everyday, hard keep track of. Nobody knows. overwhelming evidence would far worse. effectiveness lockdowns public health restrictions proven time time countries around world. 

Nobody knows exactly bad would gotten nothing, know would worse. probably lot worse. share long long enough wait? 

How old kids? I‚Äôm really sorry hear lost husband. must really difficult. also sucks selfish assholes caused quit job. people terrible.  must always blame rich people problems described. shit us purpose. likely won‚Äôt new delta-targeted booster, third dose original formula boost antibody levels sky high. It‚Äôs unclear could happen, certain demographics (elderly, immunocompromised) everyone, would personally bet boosters likely point least people. I'm interested hearing happens again. why? Vaccination one things, society decrease Covid spread. like 60% vaccinated, lot covid recovered, keep distancing, reduce big events, fine. thing year ago, need flatten curve. people vant vaccine, weak immune system, higher probability getting sick, first group get covid, get antibodies protection least months. Second group wait till good cure covid. lol no, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying - I‚Äôm saying exactly typed, wait list family doctor years long (in Quebec live.) family doctor one see regularly relationship with, without one, see whatever random doctor need one. 

I still get appointment walk-in it‚Äôs kind shit show book one, god forbid give referral specialist, hopefully loads free time call find one actually see you. father cat scan falling bike, found lesion sinus told look immediately.

Fast forward 2 years find we‚Äôre gathered around waiting go brain surgery remove tumor started tiny fucking lesion could removed outpatient procedure.

Fast forward 10 months, I‚Äôm totally bankrupt caring recovery treatments, hand care brother could leave town start over.

He died 5 years later, never returned doctor. died feeding tube brain surgery still sticking belly. Nothing article actually says treat patient best ability, though. assuming based said. painful statistic hear, feel qualified with:

over 57% people live world's 10 populous countries.

So disproportionate, massive vaccine disparity, necessarily well substantiated single statistic.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like saying 90% vaccines distributed northern hemisphere (p.s. 90% people live northern hemisphere). even obvious example: 90% vaccines given people right handed.

Although 75% vs 57% actually show disparity, know even biased / 7,880,861,461 evidence help. she'd provide stuff would seem like obvious bullshit anyone else, she'd wholeheartedly believe it. 


antivaxxers fundamentally see things different. able convince otherwise. Correct closer 1.8 100. leanant estimate. 75+ makes 79% deaths. 45 75 makes 18%. 45 makes 3%. new delta. 


This new variant hitting younger people harder. know changing. think either disease non-human reservoirs though. uniquely adapted infect people.

Coronavirus infect lot mammals.

This rabies eliminated. Lol tried thoughts prayers? read correctly, people think means. people know seem assume 33% efficacy means 67% chance getting Covid symptoms. 

What believe actually means 33% efficacy rate, 33% *less likely* exhibit symptomatic Covid. That's efficacy rate means. Somebody correct I'm wrong, read journal somewhere got confused myself. grew small town two doctors, really easy primary care doctor. currently one doctor go whenever get strep throat something. that‚Äôs relatively recent development live city. Cant herd immunity theres new strain every year, like flu. doctor saying actually said thinking? That's true, Red team getting better better exploiting structural weaknesses things like gerrymandering voter suppression win fewer fewer votes. basically wash suspect it'll take 10+ years shenanigans stop working.  That's doing. broke seal early last night. Ended taking leak every hour. Thank I'm 100% board, like get people go along, way inevitable result generations growing boomer shit south park. People trained care others hating going take lot cultural work change that. Fortunately, cash incentive help them. also helps lot working folks living paycheck paycheck days recuperate vaccine. Plus stupid lump website one thing. Think average American. Half Americans dumber that. smart people stick around dying towns sustained hate bigotry... wind higher concentration dumbest people places, making echo chamber stupidity... results stories like these. Yes Halifax, remotest remote. mom hospital. doctor pulled mask chin speak me. Sigh. Yes, exactly! 

And funny thing is, cultural concept ‚Äúmorbid humor‚Äù came Bubonic Plague. People dropping dead often plague, medieval Europeans (specifically British) developed dark humor around it. sad also laughed cynical. Even children came games play sing Bubonic Plague death. It‚Äôs natural way deal things it‚Äôs around you, time. 

And British people today still known ‚Äúspecial sense humor.‚Äù Actually, there's kind 'vaccine shedding' that's true!

OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) cheaper form polio vaccination that's pretty prevalent, especially developing countries, contain small amounts live virus variant. variant replicates intestine very, unlikely enter central nervous system could cause problems. way get body's immune system recognize danger develop immune response extremely minimal risk getting noticeably sick.

Now, areas poor hygiene sanitation (like developing countries), viruses spread due that. cool thing, though, OPV ***also*** spread way. someone gets innoculated vaccine literally shed vaccine and, poor sanitation hygiene often prevalent, end passively innoculating others vaccine. one strengths form vaccine, fact -- cheapest version + able spread via poor sanitation = great developing countries. could majority population didn‚Äôt heads asses took vaccine. personal responsibility wasn‚Äôt met. I‚Äôm unsure difficult understand. stopped panicking moment thought it, able get 70%+ vaccinated spread would slowed dramatically, didn‚Äôt. Instead huge portion population basically walking virus making machines spreading everyone they‚Äôre contact doubt incubating next goddamn variant. Considering 95%+ hospital dying unvaccinated hell think vaccines failed ludicrous. failed virus endemic. opportunity it‚Äôs gone now. 

Frankly point believe you‚Äôre arguing erroneously based myopic eye overwhelming success vaccines. agenda/or unable research comprehend information. probably think part government agenda manipulate us someshit like Well allowed work throughout past year ""right work"" rules changed absolutely notice. I've burned savings, liquidate retirement accounts, sell almost assets stateside. immigration fees, plus living here, plus misc stuff cost approximately 30k USD. advanced degree I'm married British citizen. would imagine would significantly difficult neither things true. right, vaccines never approved kids herd immunity never reached.    talking judgmental nature article looks patients dismissal. vaccine treatment part. You‚Äôre nitpicking context saying. Imagine sinking ship someone tells get life boat save life tell believe ship sinking ship sinking affect you. That's thinking too. Carlin would aneurysm half ridiculous shit happened *after* 2008. 

I feel like that's Jon Stewart threw towel too. wonder much countries distrust science due fact many us can‚Äôt access medical professionals left trying cobble together diy healthcare information non medical sources.

The rich people designed way purpose. yea....it really feels like dumb people getting taken advantage of. almost fault? dumb susceptible host misinformation there. die that? definitely kinda sucks... pro masks pro vaccines general, happens three year old starting PK3 August wear mask 5,5h. 
A three year old. 
A three year old know handle mask. take off, touch others masks, lift down, keep touching it, fidgeting it. 

I see point. First grade up, sure, three year olds? Come- on! IL state entity employer waffling allowing us even hybrid work home schedules face god damn frustrating. thing unit forced work home. even option hybrid schedules director wants us full time office. coming lockdown easing back we're told new work home policies discussed, bullshit. feel like horizon wont happen soon should. continued work home least part time regardless. smiling doesn‚Äôt really vibe title well. Took maybe 5 minutes know better waste time arguing someone like you.  people list people would much like see plane existence. Beyond people minding celebrating death people there's insanely low amount people support death penalty. saying clearly moral views minority.

And unless using word psychopath flippantly, taking joy anothers death fall definition. I've problems work lately fatigue. went ER Friday told everything fine, wanted follow cardiologist. First appointment could get end September. Glad heart could problem. NS least

Ah, remote, low population Nova Scotia many doctors want live. I'm sure that's meaningful. rural, remote areas less doctors.  I'm kind surprised biotech milking cache cow.

I mean expensive do, lobbyists outfits make operate sequencing gear working overtime make happen? eating placenta

Don't this! Arkansas erasure. We‚Äôre garbage state too! effort look posts make comment actual response than, like comparison made. problem! read couple anecdotal accounts people said long Covid symptoms disappeared vaccinated. wonder would happen case, gave someone mRNA vaccination particular disease already started? can‚Äôt read said got vaccinated yet you‚Äôre programmed call anybody disagrees anti vaxx it‚Äôs sad honestly would say relationship Jenny McCarthy publicity got together vax skepticism views promote whole anti-vaxx movement anything else last 20 years. McCarthy's crusade vaccines causing autism son basically saddled country - God knows many others - skepticism never seen lifetime. Carrey went right along girlfriend's (at time) views. fame - much greater hers, B-List actress TV personality, best FFS - gave ideas enormous publicity.  They‚Äôre lying losing what‚Äôs left already minimal critical thinking skills due rapidly dropping SpO2 No, I'm calling idiots. quoted caring them. literally used quotation marks quote you. Same! sister always super hippie, started investigating Round-Up pesticides deadly neurotoxins avoid eating organic foods (not sure she‚Äôs wrong that) websites led chemtrail-type conspiracy theories knew watching RT (Russia Today) videos price gold. went far left ended right refuses get vaccine. One former Bernie voters thought iconoclast like Trump would better insider like HC. *Facepalm* Well matter thinks get choice gets treat. Sounds like walking borderline morality case court. Hope stops practicing soon information results already there, redundant. Everyday news channels bringing ""huge highlight""; repeat exact news. fellow Canadian I've found going thing father. We've numerous long discussions become clear neither us going convince other. Yet insists constantly starting arguments insulting family members getting vaccine. productive, mean sake mean. seems rebel media convinced Canadians alienating families right thing do. 

I feel same. I'm exhausted. can't communicate someone like anymore. comes point put sanity mental health first. US done much sequencing since beginning pandemic did. full quote article ‚ÄúOne last things they‚Äôre intubated beg vaccine. hold hand tell I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs late.‚Äù

It's late treatment, late *for vaccine*. really, really, really unrealistic view public policy ""political will"". Absolutely nothing could gotten every nation shutdown perpetually. Notice countries going zero-covid small, isolated island nations, getting hit covid right now. question political address pandemic lacking, think political leadership alone could completely eliminated threat covid million Nigerian bridges sell you.  Yeap. delta timeframe. became thing pretty early on. unvaccinated person dying, late also late good many others.

Why?

Once bodies overwhelmed virus, they're also breeding-grounds mutations, got Delta. Oh I'm vaccinated primary doctor. think I've single doctor always go since child, whoever clinic takes insurance.  USA? 
Isn't can't afford healthcare play instead? ""how"", would guess targeting source information sent via social media. sources, information coming ""friends"" least semi-known otherwise valued sources. targeting, propaganda/marketing/mis-disinformation often targeted people's specific likes dislikes. accepted sources potent messaging, think people fall victim uncritical acceptance.

Also, 90s, parents really critical easier see lack critical acceptance? easy tell people believe hear/read, takes work filter lies check facts.  'hoax' supposed 'prove' now?""

It's tool trick giving freedoms!

Not sure freedoms exactly, they're pretty unclear asked specifics, they're gon' take it! Damn could read saying, pity likely can't. many die keep views. important definitely factor individual decisions people make regarding risk. vast majority cases mild (equivalent common cold flu) asymptomatic, called evidence vaccines still incredibly effective preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, deaths.

And anyone freaks out, absolutely equating COVID common cold flu. I‚Äôm saying vaccines well understood effect reducing severity something resembling common cold flu post-vaccination. ample supply I‚Äôm it. cannot accept ultra wokes back January-April asking slow share doses unvaccinated ourselves.   realize though. dig die, blame doctors nurses giving proper care save dumbasses. one note mentions think white people would get sick.

A lot people mind vectors disease long white people dying, good riddance them. Fox News employees require full vaccinations, GOP politicians said covid hoax first line, even skipped highest risk people, get it. They‚Äôre still saying Covid issue. Absolute BS. 

Now Fox news saying viewers get vaccine deaths shutdowns hurting billionaire sponsors. bunch monkeys. Damn dark‚Ä¶. real need hear it. parent doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable sending kid school without masks it‚Äôs none business. it‚Äôs definitely psychopathic behavior. That‚Äôs *I* talking about. Didn‚Äôt say anything kids homeschooled forever. Lol. majorly overreacting.  200 countries? 45 dumbass. everything fault. India alone blew roof thing Delta variant. zero-covid countries struggling. absolutely way different president could ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù covid completely. said ""against getting COVID"", symptomatic cases. tried clarify, getting Covid, getting actually sick worse.  14 fully vaccinated people developed COVID ended hospital

I think important see metrics people are. immunocompromised/elderly, still extremely unlikely young healthy person terrible go fully vaxxed. science reach conclusion

This, unfortunately, usually involves reading fringe science sources, social media, youtube videos.

If often wondered anti-vax stuff took root among Gen-X mommy crowd first generation memory diseases vaccines eradicated/suppressed There's real lack context numbers, pretty step results literally everywhere else. Would helpful know whether symptomatic, asymptomatic, etc. Hopefully shit like wakes people nonsense they‚Äôve let take lives.  Yes. Absolutely saying. 

Look mutations Lambda variant ravaging Peru right now. spike proteins mutating enough walk past vaccines. People Covid positive weeks catching Lambda variant. Vaxxed folks getting en masse there. 

Delta come strong infect unvaxxed folks took masks vaxxed folks did. Lambda, next version mutates put everyone else back chopping block. video mostly covers Madrid, Spain working, low pay, dealing death everyday. mention abusive patents, although expect British/American problem.  Wear KN95 N95, otherwise wearing mask coworkers effective going much, much better last year. Cases going skyrocket, deaths going increase nearly much. vaccinated continue extremely well protected serious outcomes well protected symptomatic illness.

There might mask mandates places (unfortunately places needed), probably it. Bars, restaurants, businesses likely continue open full capacity restrictions. might even smaller number exceptions rule.

In likelihood, FDA approves vaccine, employers schools everywhere going mandate it.

You quote this. going bend unvaccinated, long hospitals completely overrun. bunch countries standard incoming travelers.  Two Greek letters.

In 2032 start using three variants sound like cool fraternities. lot people denial fact, early original variants seemed kids general ok.

What overlooked even asymptomatic individuals long term health effects pulmonary disease original billed vascular one, one significantly damage blood vessels flu. everyone perfectly ok thinking kids fine barely got sniffles, ok learning may kill millions kids future due damage caused hospital now, mean ""ok.""

They honestly want go pretending old unhealthy people disease everyone disease damaging everyone even people dont even outwardly get sick. Arizona? like here. mom starts soon (as teacher). crazy. even see stories, social media personalized nowadays they're trapped echo chamber making. work healthcare ,and I'm sick stomach thought may go back trainwreck last year. think there‚Äôs also fair amount ‚Äúnothing bad happen me‚Äù well. know several people managed avoid thus think it‚Äôs something happens others. never said CDC developer. they‚Äôre ones driving public messaging. 

Delta spreading like wildfire people think it‚Äôs ok go maskless won‚Äôt contract virus. live unvaxxed high risk populations, current guidance outdated incorrect based idea vaccines prevent getting spreading it. 

We know Israel data many older vaxxed people dying Delta. us live and/or work vaxxed high risk people, risk profile changed. shouldn‚Äôt assume safe assume end spreading Delta aforementioned risk populations

Many elder facilities Massachusetts loosened restrictions masking/social distancing. going prove mistake vaxxed employees visitors spread Delta easily.  many free speech absolutists make happen anytime soon, unfortunately. Saying certain proportion catch covid.... 
  
As wave takes proportions change, media field day foreseeable headlines, day vaccinated unvaccinated sick, spread panic vaccine hesitancy.  think (disingenuous) methodology divide number breakthrough cases total number covid cases date, including ones vaccine available and/or Delta variant entered scene. See? percentage really low!

Probably meaningful numbers derived data collected last weeks. created herd immunity deaths.

That's...not herd immunity works. think VA started updating covid dashboard show data grouped unvaccinated vaccinated. states likely show that. think that‚Äôs super helpful. feel like titles meant deceptive presented context many people vaccinated. example, 0 vaccinated people, 100% infections would unvaccinated people, would say nothing efficacy vaccines. Similarly, 100% vaccinated people, 100% infections would vaccinated would say nothing efficacy vaccines. Yep. I‚Äôm saint I‚Äôm it. local nurse literally unvaccinated patient survive needing ventilated left hospital cussing making sick covid hoax. Anything else want say get banned. remember reading short story school small rural town used select citizen random killed offered sacrifice bring strong crop yield. story takes place day draw unlucky citizens name learn much farming community loves respects tradition. Sure enough, wife one biggest advocates system drawn, instant changes tune starts screaming absurdity making many logical arguments sacrifice impact rain temperature... rest town dismisses mad ramblings carries execution. Even husband, obviously torn, permits execution take place. Deep shit grade 11.

People believe inconvenient truths impacts personally. usually late. we're starting next one likely much larger first.

Much larger how? suggesting we're going severe wave COVID pre-vaccine? appreciate kind words obviously agree whole heartedly. even putting politics aside, wish doctors tried process realize frustrating is.

First thing call, get deathly annoying recording ""If medical emergency dial 911..."". getting voicemail, telling someone return call. hoping life get way remembering someone doctor's office actually call back. told first available appointment 3 weeks good luck shift worker gets schedule weekly. list obstacles put wonder themselves, people default running doctor cause... science.

&amp;#x200B;

But care. you‚Äôre vaccinated gift doctor. Praying continue compassion regardless whether patients deserve not. isn‚Äôt case Delta. It‚Äôs much faster. true, imagine would 4:1 ratio Gamma:Beta. say key mutations similar; K417T, E484K, N501Y vs K417N, E484K, N501Y. Personally I'd tend believe SA study people refer perhaps that's optimist me. wonder if, gasping last breathes, desperately trying get air, stop think ‚ÄúMaybe gotten vaccine all‚Äù.  I‚Äôm sorry first wave wasn‚Äôt 12 months long. Waves seasonal. Whatever you‚Äôve saying months wrong. propaganda / MSM lies‚Äù

Yet they'll double 'it's flu' thing. CCP line jump.

I'm kidding, many people think canard origins FOX. Wrong! CCP's public stance was: ""Don't worry, flu. Nothing see here,"" welding people homes shutting Wuhan.

The denialists/hoaxers/anti-vaxxer crowd decry anything fit narrative CCP agitprop, yet they'll consistently repeat original CCP Propaganda. That's logical position take I'm sure lot harder maintain watching someone die. fundamentally emotional beings, something happening right front tends overwhelm logic used decide feel it. glad live Vermont problem is, course, two organizations listed provided conflicting guidance. Yeah best could information‚Ä¶ really hated Biden something. *CPAC cheers* Serious question. would anyone go bar LA mandating masks  That's pretty much understand it, too, really found conclusive guidance this.

In particular would important know reliable Antigen tests determine whether someone contagious time (which would validate use control access events, restaurants, etc.). numbers I've seen really say that.

So according evaluations antigen tests specificity sensitivity, according sources 40% false negative rate. extremes unclear (at least me) exact conditions numbers apply, relates actual infectiousness. reminds Maude Flanders said once: 


""Oh Neddy, terrifying! thought headed eternal bliss paradise!"" We're talking kids, school, COVID. simple ""let homeschool zero COVID"". That's irrational view. Decisions make based known risks ifs. escape? get town see real life actually is, fabricated world parents taught you. see certain people talking colleges ""indoctrinating"" students. colleges indoctrinating anyone; students experiencing life outside bubble change world view. offer thoughts prayers?? know do. traveling least anti-lockdown state

Which states locked down? Reopen wish. stupid shove vaxxed people together negative tested people building think _this work fine_! 

If want learn mistakes done Netherlands Israel, fine, go ahead. Keep pandemic alive spreading. Papa r/Nurgle pleased! 

For dummies: vaxxed, protect yourself, best! still carry virus without symptoms all, still spread everyone else, vaxxed not. people need show negative test event likely ones vaxxed, soon ones get sick new virus. 

Why would business suffer mask mandate anyways?? really goes back people could tried set things straight, maybe succeed maybe don‚Äôt, wishywashy want keep cult around instead.

Hence, vaccine ‚Äúpersonal choice.‚Äù didnt consult gp since year. got shot asap, waste time, get damn shot. German btw zero cost either way website literally stopthespread.org Massachusetts billboards say stop - slow 

We told vaccines would prevent spread. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre seeing Delta

I understand Delta new. messaging campaigns need updated

Pfizer appear stopping spread effectively. helping reduce - eliminate death severe case - campaign ‚Äústop spread‚Äù seeing massive spread among vaccinated communities, undercut public perception vaccine

Pfizer CDC need get change messaging ‚Äúit won‚Äôt stop getting COVID reduce Really? Every day read news people hospital dying unvaccinated. 

Yes, stories vaccine efficacy falling, reality no? Consuming good bad news make person anti-vax. 

Got vaxxed 3 months ago I'd happily take many boosters health experts say would helpful, also want know bad news regarding vaccine.    I‚Äôm Canada put foot 76 yo father. time wants talk refuse unless outside source isn‚Äôt Facebook Rebel Media. minute says ‚ÄúI read Facebook‚Äù sees face change knows what‚Äôs coming. won‚Äôt get vaccine refused around fully vaxxed. Even stay away much more. He‚Äôs alienated family. best friend seeing he‚Äôs become put wedge us I‚Äôm fighting anymore. I‚Äôm tired family members deserve time. US slipped 2nd G7 doses administered per capita 5th. Canada, UK, Germany Italy passed US.

So yes, vaccine hesitancy countries, vaccine hesitancy US higher average developed countries appears. Granted varies greatly state. Vermont administered nearly double doses per capita Mississippi example. live someone still high risk even vaccinated (like do), NEED know things. can't bury information we're afraid give fodder people never going get vaccinated first place. really appreciate article. father law sister law vaccinated worried them. easy write unvaccinated people entity, actually know individuals different. article tragic. Many people got sucked misinformation believed wrong sources. mistake results painful death like this. horrible. 19th century anymore. could choose try different TV channels, could choose go internet sites different opinions, could buy newspapers, magazines, books shows different way thinking. lot information easily available nowadays. Living completely one sided information bubble choice adults. cdc developer vaccine. incorrect regards Pfizer never made claim regarding efficacy infection.

All points stand. that‚Äôs rub. way could sympathy folks thought death appropriate punishment low critical thinking skills. Wow, (and doctors) feel sicknesses people bring (smoking, unhealthy eating, obesity, lack exercise, etc.)?

‚ÄúCobia said it‚Äôs different mentally emotionally care someone could prevented disease chose to.

‚ÄúYou kind go thinking, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôm going feel bad person, make choice,‚Äô‚Äù Cobia said. ‚ÄúBut actually see them, see face face, really changes whole perspective, they‚Äôre still person thinks made best decision could information have, misinformation that‚Äôs there.‚Äù

And yes, realize says doesn‚Äôt feel way actually sees patient I‚Äôm surprised hear admission initial thoughts people.  forget advertising spokeswoman vaping. Like, choose side. Supposedly is.

Governors DeSantis (FL), Lee (TN), Noem (SD); safely vaxxed still denouncing vaccination voter base. 

What stunned assholes trying accomplish? Okay, still sure point is. Infectious diseases different non-communicable lifestyle-related diseases due diligence vaccination kills others. They'll parrot 99% survival rate thing tune anything else say. working remotely, think 'standing' challenge health-care company's hiring practices. words, bit good. one approached (email only) selling stuff MLM marketing scam got into.

It‚Äôs way lax environment kids immunocompromised unable vaxxed, need part mask up

plus cases concentrated area likely introduce Los Angeles Variant #2  Good point! know could making healthier choices every day. think frustration getting vaccinated quick free one (or two) time thing. healthier lifestyle general requires making sacrifices time energy sometimes money every day without much show one bit effort. early months pandemic debate much people expected upend daily lives livelihoods help protect community. readily available effective vaccine, essentially easiest way avoid make actual sacrifices. people even save others harder understand. hard wear mask? genuinely feel bad (as individuals) also anti-vax mask people literally killing innocent people willful ignorance. super upsetting. long drink hand wear one They're foolish ignorant uneducated Australia still 15%, that's different reasons thumbnail image wrong context story! US citizen go get wanna 'that guy' start back fourth. 
But they're stage complete desperation, really cared TRY ivermectin? 
I'm medical professional, listened JRE podcast bret weinstein Dr pierre kory, well research drug cities tried it. 
It seems great results Nah NBA finals! guys got crushed, might see sad people around today :D That's hilarious. implying covid equally dangerous cold flu, okay buddy. That's cases cold flu going ham filling hospitals last January. Also someone who's calling else ""purely selfish"" wanting avoid additional harsh lockdowns unnecessary suffering others, okay bud. Keep telling good person. doctor's account goes show hospital, everything much raw black white. easy us pass judgment people behind keyboards, front lines treating patients around clock, clearer view reality.

This reminds NBC news reporter basically opposite doctor. reporter interviewing covid patient get vaccinated sacred. hospital hooked sorts machinery visibly miserable, reporter acting really smug hounding decision vaccinate, already said regretted.

We proponents vaccinations without going patients ""gotcha"" statements. enemy patients misinformation that's plaguing communities. That's extremely unlikely us die result covid. Maybe 30-50 years, now. fair, America afford primary care doctor? find little strange they‚Äôre discussing immunocompromised seniors. guess nothings stopping going there, seems two going hand-in-hand booster discussions. Yes, really simple question medication husband's accidentally took breastfeeding son found similar program insurance. helpful. ok     ‚ÄúSo feels like impending doom, basically.‚Äù

Because unvaccinated paramedics working county....like what!?! even wear masks anymore. NJ cases keep going spite us highest vaxx rates country. I'm fully vaxx'd everyone live vast majority people spend time with. I'm worried moment, I've going without masks except required since hit 2 weeks post-shot 2 (1st week June) man hard little concerned rising numbers. Yea mostly unvaxx'd people like said I'm worried people closest yet. others said, people sit around unvaxx'd allow spread, especially large portions people cannot get vaxx'd, likely variants vaccines less effective arise. gonna happen soon? IDK I'm gonna act like will. man getting hard actually excited things going relatively back normal case numbers keep going up. Obviously numbers nowhere near peak necessarily worth panic yet. feels like tease, part, getting vaccinated, staying distant, benefits seem right around corner, theres whole new potential mess.

Like said, I'm full freaking yet definitely occupying mind space would like. I'm sorry suffered. trying minimize went means. long covid Propaganda killing one Republican time. Theres ""lockdown"" - essentially longer enforceable restrictions place all, unvaccinated simply ignore signs target uniquely blend everyone else. definitely plays part responsible disastrous response, actors also contributed fair share. We're point can't even honest discussions around origins virus. months media told us racist considered lab leak hypothesis. Fauci admitted lying masks, repeatedly told us would vaccine April, moved goal posts herd immunity based thought nation ready hear playing games refusing answer questions NIH funding GOF research.

Can't say really surprising people turning Facebook conspiracy theories trust institutions continues drop. thought America best health care, expensive. cheaper hospital? full? referring storm? I'm Phoenix hit.  least 30% people contracted long-term issues greatly shorten lives decrease quality lives. Even asymptomatic people getting issues (which hard find, people like experiencing whole host long-covid issues last year despite never testing positive - pulmonologist says he's swamped people like me)

So basically really fucking stupid take. judge getting it?I judged selfish. I've *always* pro-vaccine. higher risk means got mine early glad. 

You see siding people cant empathise anyone directly connected makes ass?

You see sticking people refusing vaccine lot world havent got yet makes ass? Damn Phoenix must dead last night though üò≠ think much stress caused personally, angry made you, compassion gone again. I'm sure reading research says empathy teachable. gets harder teach older get.

Of course people born without empathy, fringe cases.


the way conceptualize think like dial analogy.

A person might born level 5. Parents nurture trait raise empathy level points. people might born higher lower levels, might start 0.


But say teachable true all.


And yes leaded gasoline definitely affected previous generation.


It multitude things, one. distrust there, it‚Äôs really hard get rid of, especially it‚Äôs reinforced every time go see doctor.

I joke bringing penis doctors take seriously woman. friend jokes bringing white person her, it‚Äôs warranted based experiences she‚Äôs had. One relatives worked nursing homes saw plenty outbreaks never got it. months vaccinated went go visit son daughter law family said vaccinated. 

They fucking lied shots couple weeks later everyone got sick including him. Three died. hospital weeks. said really fatigued close week fine. silver lining virus disproportionately affecting un-vaxxed. Literally half LA County protected, even infected never hospitalized. put aside unvaxxed perilous health outcomes covid, main quandary accelerating widespread infection (and mandatory 10-day quarantine) affect productivity &amp; job security going forward? everyone luxury working home, blue-collar workers especially may find jobs imperiled take time off, often unpaid. Unlike flu cold can't go back work couple days covid. checked state, system *entire state* would purple! kids pediatrician dismissing clients practice refuse vaccines general. Saying good fit care. Yes, course is. trained get past feeling provide best care everyone regardless. course feeling different treating chronic alcoholic die esophageal varices, opposed child hit car.  essentially cope prevent Westerners demanding anything effective done. 

Even last Pandemic, Spanish Flu, got SIGNIFICANTLY deadly finished. went SS never HMS Great Britain, whereas passenger steamship (SS). Either, really :) Sorry man, 0% risk society. must stay inside, wear mask, talk one 0% risk dying  would statement, I'm sure kind statement would one. wife cardiac ICU RN asked perspective before. still offer sympathy people choose put colleagues danger. basically said thing. end day, people ignore safety measures still people scared/afraid die. cannot find compassion beyond hope find different job. 

No man island, John Donne says. Welp! die, surely shift funds agencies.  Dude judge get vaccine, judge don‚Äôt get vaccine, see makes look like ass? yell hoax mis information. get Covid tell doctors nurses fix them. make out, thank god saving yell validations it‚Äôs bad. someone asked vaccination status says ""It's none business"", could say, ""If unvaccinated, threat society everyone's business."" America one vaccinated countries work loll. Maybe people get vaccinated people like didn‚Äôt hold arrogant belief smarter haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet  go emergency room abdominal pain around spring last year. coughed put covid section put confirmed suspected covid patients. risk group doubted actually covid put room covid section. Tests well stocked said doubt it, test put precaution. wheeled room covid section saw lot nurses wearing surgical masks seemingly PPE. were, others nothing. expressed concern put covid ward asked mask nurse said ""oh fine. See?! We're even wearing masks here."" 

On way night asked get home. thought might covid seemed unsafe catch taxi get bus possibly infect people. said chances covid slim I'm OK take bus. Unfortunately still made walk entire covid ward full beds sick people get exit though. like enough covid suspect take test precautions got hospital, much suspect allowed covid section. 

I scared walking ward get out. thinking covid yet sure heck might now! point wheeling people could barely breathe past ICU trying keep distance get exit. remember trying hold breath would help. 

Luckily end covid getting hospital end. Phoenix. Honestly, heat bad. meant ""try understand Canadian medical system, better USA, significant shortages difficulty accessing care, limited whatever backwater think NS is."" can't kids vaccinated?  wonder take people. I'm totally proof vaccination international travel force hold outs sure. Even day trip US land crossing, yes need fully vaxxed.

My supervisor says get vax, loves go golf trip every spring. Well, choice make, forgo annual trip forever get jab done it.

I think he's really anti-vax either, he's pretty far right politically, huge Trump fan (even though we're Canadian) basically covid denier camp overblown know anyone died it, nothing worse flu bug. 

At least road trips him, told manager I'm comfortable riding un-vaxxed .. well last trips bit annoying listen far right rants constantly :) That's rough felt read article badly side effects set athletes back training. cognitively understand you‚Äôve training something *years*/your whole life, quite literally, don‚Äôt want anything jeopardize feel like requirement vaccinated way athletes sport ‚Äúdisadvantage‚Äù set back side effects, makes sense. yeah, it‚Äôs madness. Several (5‚Äì10?) athletes already tested positive covid. asymptomatic, still. still idea long term side effects could be.  better? That's literally misinformation, google ""UK vaccine count"" numbers. Ahh, ‚Äúyou people‚Äù.. joy! Sorry pointing fact matter. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre scared. Fear not. You‚Äôre far likely die car accident covid. conversation someone travel sub this, can't seem find answer anywhere. 

After recovering Covid seems PCR tests detect virus three months recovery. common this? Also, case antigen test? assume antigen test much less sensitive, test positive recovery. wrong? would kindly tell tech go kick rocks.  No. people saw news like everyone else. dont care abiut deaths millions people come crying affects you, hold deepest contempt. pig ignorant.

It entirely people who've done maintain health people outside circle judge people dont. 

What suggest? let carry on?  No. willful ignorance, often aggressive willful ignorance. live world possible due efforts scientists engineers yet refuse look facts they've come scientists? people blame themselves. dark ages know told Church clergy literate people know. Where'd head to! recently move back south RIP Thank basically articulating thoughts people start freaking case numbers lockdowns ending much eloquent way could. goal beginning limit infections rates keep mortality rates low vaccines started roll out. vaccines out, new goal seems get rid covid entirely, matter much costs society. 

People continue die covid year, next year, ten years. flu killing thousands people every year yet see anyone calling immediate lockdowns flu season comes around. people still obsessed case numbers day day? alright go back normal without feeling like we're harming others? answer permanently socialize online always wear masks going like end times? that's case, thank you. life lockdown year half already people subreddit seem spreading misinformed message people still following strict lockdown procedures despite vaccines available. Maybe that's fine people like leaving homes, people desperately need society return normal like me, permanent solution I'll following. Get vaccines boosters live life people. Hmm, sure correct. quote, ""The stringent protection free speech would protect man falsely shouting fire theatre causing panic."" context quote court saying context speech important determining whether protected. example, shouting fire movie theatre dangerous therefore illegal. shouting fire empty park less dangerous probably legal. actual issue question whether someone could convicted distributing anti draft literature wartime. One points court made context(wartime) made offense criminal might peace time. 

Also, keep mind, case mostly overturned. guess still missing point? 

Nope, understand point pretty many people still vulnerable virus? forget natural infections..

Because immunity post-natural infection varies significantly individual individual. constantly told ""we already"" ""true infections 40x higher confirmed infections"" yet... there's still enough vulnerable hosts left drive ""surge?"" How?

There's confirmed numbers, even agreed upon estimates, actual infections vs reported infections. 40x reported cases a, frankly, silly number too. There's 34 million covid cases US. 40x times 1.36 billion cases...the US 328 million people. mean come dude, that's natural infection count vaccination right, correct? I'm also told lot too. 

No. Anyone who's told idea they're talking public health officials stated that. I'm confused, among even unvaccinated, still many people left antibodies?

Because natural infections wildly unpredictable provide consistency expected antibodies vaccine. think need take break sub dude. anxiety inducing getting sorts incorrect info. recommend checking science sub, /r/covid19. scientific journals papers allowed. helps sift noise lot.  Yes they're dumb, punishment stupidity death. be. punishment lie made possible stupidity lead death. Aka certain leader certain political tribe who's pushing misinformation around. parents vaccinated? way aren‚Äôt lot vaccinated people getting covid? CDC ACIP discussing boosters immunocompromised tomorrow's meeting.

Retargeting vaccines Delta independent question.  Changing mRNA vaccine's content straightforward happen necessary actually shipping modified vaccine involves bunch work rest vaccine testing, production, distribution pipeline they're going unnecessary. LOSES, looses. I‚Äôve seen mistake many times recently  That's dismissal. late vaccine help them. sorry, time sedated intubation. dismissing giving up, giving best treatment (a ventilator). Yes, agree racism health care - vaccines simple case merit concern case... especially since prescription black people white people get exact vaccine! plenty cause concern different areas, zero cause concern case vaccines conflate different situations anti vaxx madness. Also state governments barely outreach give paid sick days get people vaccinated. states instead pushed remove mask mandates opening everything. see cases rising lowest vaccinated states. Someone posted [this (along number others similar findings) found helpful

Hmm Interesting. Thank sharing data. know sure delta kids. don‚Äôt think data. Correct I‚Äôm wrong. Also psychopath!? Morally depraved maybe homeschooling kids? Don‚Äôt people time already? type mentality makes care helping poor vulnerable people, need it. even then. Frankly, one reasons US shithole unless well wealthy.

I read comment Norwegian regarding way prisoners treated prison . interviewer asked thought okay prisoners treated well. answered, one day prisoner could neighbour, yes, rather well treated.

It's attitude neighbours differentiate socialist countries USA exact position decided go. reality vaccine put risk levels line infectious diseases pre-covid. using many resources, burnout health care workers quitting en masse. article says 6 months. Yes, I‚Äôm sure data going back year. point, least based article provided, assertion right based evidence least 6 months. article assert year. 

I would assume that‚Äôs sample size 6 month period likely large enough statistically significant, sample size 12 months not. think pharma companies could assert, based evidence, 12 month immunity would it? would say least 6 months 12 months solid data? Maybe there‚Äôs enough statistically significant amount data yet make claim‚Ä¶ difficult point feel much empathy unvaccinated. amazing selfish are. make ridiculously informed decision, they're thinking themselves. children can't get vaccinated? immunocompromised? old people even vaccine risk mild symptoms?

They simply care....they care themselves...all time. exactly pandemic raging. they're walking around Covid, get hospitalized, think many people potentially harmed complete selfishness.

If choose self-select...whatever...its can't think beyond tragic. sympathy whatsoever. going die anyway, government policies designed promote life health?

People already reached life expectancy already got enjoy long life, worth making everyone else continue suffer try keep alive tiny bit longer. government needs take account everyone's health evidence shows lockdowns cause damage put family friends?

The ones reached life expectancy, sacrifice everyone going die winter save expense bother.

Nobody talking sacrificing anyone except you. People need able live lives enough people vaccinated. even read things reply to? seem like. procedure run Greek letters variants? Trying plan ahead 2025 agree. chances lower natural immunity general population takes 4 months 16? Seems antivaxxers going get covid. question timeframe. ‚ÄúWhat minimum amount pain medication give them?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah let‚Äôs that‚Äù  ton respiratory stuff going around. talked pediatrician said saw 31 patients presenting coughs fevers Monday, covid negative.  Latest real world data Canada showed AZ performing pretty well Vs Beta, 83% protection Vs hospitalisation death 1 see around me, people sure viruses, vaccines immune system work. Citations biology handbook help understand. suggest never aggressive them, share educational infographics references. definitely happened! 10 Republicans vote Senate mandate vaccination lmk. I'm doubtful even get half Democrats that. We're stuck dude. vaccine mandate vaccine passport coming overwhelming majority Americans (maybe 1 2 states passport I'm counting it). unfortunately good battle Covid 19 likely kids able get vaccinated early next year. dog driving example/analogy beautiful. Thank you! &lt;3 covid thing lockdowns stop. Children's mental health, normal healthcare, people going treatment illnesses, impacts lockdowns benign, every adult offered vaccine, else done? entirely preventable. Question, sort societal equalibrium point people refusing vaccine treatment, believe conspiracy theory, dying off? making country progressive? wish would inspire people get vaccinated. much hate mindset anti-vaxxers, desire see anyone suffer die faulty thinking. 

It learning opportunity, condemnation.  open idea changing minds, wouldn‚Äôt spot. I‚Äôve read people still refusing believe lay dying. It‚Äôs seems nothing save people take many them. mentality mass shooter. keep saying ""1% death rate"" thinking insignificant not. 1% means \*10 times\* deadly flu results \~70 million dead worldwide. concept number means. assure regardless else happens, U.S. military mandate vaccine members. optional. (There already ton vaccines mandatory military.)

They play comes force readiness. U.S. military stupid lot things, sort thing one them. jesus late.. would see one-off story, immediately say person got sick particular condition (e.g. sick person ___ area, fat, thin, old, pre-existence condition makes exception, etc.)  much now-useless knowledge get vaccine last spring, helping people super eager get vaccinated. positive feeling. It‚Äôs sad seeing momentum evaporate. certainly would it.  "" ‚ÄòWhy haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine?‚Äô I‚Äôll ask point blank, least judgmental way possible,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd them, they‚Äôre honest, give answers. ‚ÄòI talked person, **I saw thing Facebook**, got email, **saw news**,‚Äô ""

Why organisations held least partially culpable due misinformation midst lethal pandemic?

I'm sorry, people held account. fine means jack shit earn equivalent GDP average sized European country year. People really going prison. Need people vaccinated reach herd immunity variant. bad supposed close friend, Rock Hudson, dying AIDS mean damn thing Ronald &amp; Nancy came taking single action towards combating epidemic. despicable people were, yet many Republicans still consider saints. somewhat fascinating watch darwinism work real time. That‚Äôs OK anti-VAX or‚Äôs going get vaccinated they‚Äôre afraid happens 10 years I‚Äôm OK actually dying within 10 years understand, infected provide much immunity vaccine. they‚Äôre already suggesting elderly particular need booster shot due faster waning immunity.

I‚Äôd probably keep distance remain masked around child vaccinated. zero knowledge political affiliation, I‚Äôm going go limb say isn‚Äôt republican. massive part Republican Party starts push vaccination, nothing change. Cognitive dissonance man.. want see it. want admit it. people tied identity unvaccinated. team. They're tribal would rather die admit wrong. sad. Humanity needs good purge apparently. Singapore still masking good deal population vaccinated. reach higher numbers vaccination, probably revisit decision. quarantined carriers. I've actually known people resistant getting vaccine, come around recently. Mostly contact tracing guidelines. vaccinated exposed, qaurintine 2 weeks. Unvaccinated exposed do, least state. Friends mine 12-17 year old kids, saw bunch decide get School year starts exact reason. Tell horny teenager able see 2 weeks within feet someone caught it, surprised fast get doctor pharmacy. think everything disagree lie, nothing ever change mind. really can't understand downvoted.  


So many people seem want ignore that, chances low kids harmed covid, *is still risk kids* like ignore kids may fine *their families* may not.  

 
I, one, comfortable offering people's kids harmed die, comfortable offering kids lose parent, parents, family members, downplaying possible risks dangers. sympathy families too. obese sister law didn‚Äôt get vaccinated covid it‚Äôs painful family right amount ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs fault anyway‚Äù make fear go away (or grief heaven forbid dies). Sure it‚Äôs fault, doesn‚Äôt mean death would absolutely wreck family emotionally. five six children die Covid? Yes, tough luck them. correctly understood. America one place one person. hundreds millions people different cultures, religions, ethnicities. geography also diverse different parts country feel like different countries themselves.

I think Fauci dead said today's media existed previously America would still polio. impact media, social media, push people extremes whatever politics believe, distrust called ""other side"" ...it can't stated.

I've seen many people I've always considered intelligent, rational creatures get sucked 24 hour media cycle, always echo chamber whatever already want believe. problem. sad plenty dumb nurses too. think prematurely re-instating mask mandate would  We're thinking thing here. ignore individual tragedies, world getting two things here: reduced carbon footprint, greater likelihood party brain able take real power next couple elections. they're themselves. Things better (other above-mentioned children immunocompromised). Ehh flu shot ignored overall. 

I never got one offered free shift worked healthcare. work interact regularly small children elderly rarely got sick self, see point. 

I'm way lazy get shot otherwise. 

Now I'm bit active.  ding vaccine efficacy, accuracy sake article goes say positive residents also offered monoclonals. residents well combo vaccine + monoclonals.

Oh wait, thought said ""Don't treat me."" Israeli data Pfizer's effectiveness lower Delta variants.

That mean least effective Delta vaccines. vaccines could also less effective Delta. information yet. never said that. respiratory illnesses similar levels deadliness. share sentiment. Unvaxxed? I'm good. want protect myself. also want protect case I'm carrying asymptomatic due vaxxed. mostly? want spend time associate kind people. I'm embarrassed disgusted them, can't spend time someone like that. hugely blame people getting it, people spreading it, people ignoring long Yeah guess threat job loss due vaccine refusal result one 3 things.

1. Refuser gives gets vaccinated
2. Quits
3. Lawsuit.

Considering California plenty hungry lawyers, I'm leaning 3 Don‚Äôt lose hope, think progress past year half. Don‚Äôt play media‚Äôs narratives, they‚Äôre narratives reason. count one dosers vaccinated They've programmed believe anything see ""mainstream media."" come Fox News similar places, disregard propaganda. ironic everything actually believe literally propaganda. hope things improve here. Right now, governments keep taking vaccines vacced countries. even seen photos huge crates vaccines (not enough population still) shipped Covax cases keep going up, vaccinations.

It‚Äôs hard get clear information plan is. testing like crazy strict quarantines even exposed case. pretty hard lockdown doesn‚Äôt feel hopeful much good right delta. I‚Äôm convinced lockdowns help point government running time many people need able leave homes work feed families. even get vaccines, it‚Äôs big feat vaccinate millions people January. maybe. hope so. Yeah others mentioned, Lions Packers got vaccinated, insist won‚Äôt vaccinate Packers vaccinated, shows support Lions‚Ä¶ next powerful mutation definitely trouble maker.  Ronald Reagan Roger Ailes BJ? Wowsers! read story nurse. older man treating Covid asking vaccine. back head, thinking, unlikely make hospital.  Well clearly said dangerous deadlier. confusing 2 terms may ask dangerous? Look studies show efficacy vaccines less alpha variant. datapoints well still completely ignoring point many us little kids home unvaccinated.

already answer ""The reason alert cant get vaccine understandable take precautions rarely case reddit"" Yeah‚Ä¶

But definitely don‚Äôt say cases rising shrinking fairly low numbers ‚Äúsurge‚Äù

There tons non-covid related unnecessary illness death every day. point covid part everyday life? downplay it, seem making mountains mole hills past months. Which, put words mouth, seems u/this_place_stinks may getting at? Exactly. Extremely low immunisation levels Africa could lead strains appearing causing another wave. Vaccines aren‚Äôt perfect. vaccinated person swimming sea viral particles - it‚Äôs invincibility shield. keep mind ugliness people chose express past year half, dries sympathy right again. Well, news tend harp minorities disproportionately affected virus. they're idiots, least coming somewhere. reasoning skills completely absurd. honestly find left wonder they're actually serious make ridiculous arguments fun knowing side going respond factual statements.  Good ole natural selection think talk mask mandates broadly. People know vaccinated, example live someone can't be, someone vulnerable, mostly still wearing masks certain places even though too. 

If employer knows staff vaccinated, staff wear masks? Probably not. think given everything read, unvaccinated students wear Schools. know kids low risk, people act like means immune, not. also capable spreading it, even symptomatic. Florida passed law said businesses could ask people vaccination status, one representatives asked language added would protect vaccinated people discrimination (a private school firing vaccinated people). Florida legislature declined. 

The lady article moron, take moron whole new level Florida. Don‚Äôt feel bad, Victoria. Accurate ‚Äúthose people‚Äù area higher chances infected - even vaccinated. Breakthroughs thing mild/moderate clinical term - meaning less hospitalization. 2 life sentences non violent crime

Wow. sounds even harsh US. Biden Administration needs set kind free two week hotel quarantine athletes coming home Olympics, regardless test results. sad thing Red team's anti-Covid-vax stance largely result main media source downplaying need safety vaccine effort politicaly harm Team Blue's leader, people pushing vaccinated themselves. really Red team's pawns sacrificed order improve position Red Team's pieces chess board. Or.. good thing dangerously stupid people humbled change.  One many reasons sympathy expended, instead feeling sorry I'm laughing it. Good riddance  ever miracle time, vaccinations. can't understanding situation? heard reasoning, makes sense. actually read that's though? impression feeling pressure open up, especially they'd promising ages. 

Waiting another month seeing we're close vaccinating everyone seems like might've good compromise case well. Would get lot people vaccinated (and vaccines taking effect) time still fair way winter. need luck dragon. could benefited even percentage points fully vaccinated. believe adults eligible vaccine recently 8 week waiting period doses, meaning everyone fully vaccinated. need remove mask mandate? Indoor dining, gyms, etc. done safely point vaccine numbers what‚Äôs benefit removing mask mandate especially places like public transportation? vast majority new COVID-19 cases Spain past five weeks detected among non-vaccinated people, Health Minister Carolina Darias said Monday, new infections rose 27,286.

Just 5.5% new cases within period detected among people fully vaccinated, Darias said, adding 11.4% partially vaccinated 83.1% unvaccinated. also wanted weed, couldn‚Äôt give us? Happy hear this. breakthrough cases reported - one friend - I‚Äôve gotten bit nervous mom. she‚Äôs double vaxxed hearing people similar age catching OK extremely reassuring. Plus, think it‚Äôd affect mental state way stopped going much normalize lot pain suffering.

Also there's lot anti vaxxers probably led overestimating many doses need. Reminder talking state world, US, UK, even developed world general.

It's likely time 2024 we'll still seeing headlines like these. mean us still wearing masks encountering closed things 2024.

With said, wave even on? know around April-June 2020 lots talk ""second wave"", also discussion ""the second peak first wave"" ""reminder still first wave"", ""true"" second wave would entail development variant la 1918.

Which guess could easily describe current situation given Delta, but... opens whole new worms. Alpha-Gamma? waves? 5th wave? 2020 summer peak, unaffected variants, count wave, even though obviously severe current wave due vaccines back then?

To lot talk constitutes true ""wave"" ""peak"" seems like no-true-Scotsman fallacy. even think there's formal definition qualifies one. particular, ""we still first wave"" thing sounds less like actual scientific statement vehicle media motivate compliance. There's recent data israel suggesting natural works better vaccines alone Damn, feel privileged one anti-vaxxer √Æn office others fully vaxxed. kooks latch onto idea ""getting vaccinated protect Delta, anyway.

Also allow work home. I'm software engineer, I'm productive home people bug day. 

But guess they'd rather keep office outbreaks (up 3 since came back work June far). I'm wearing mask üòê Except availability enough.

People sit around half vaccinated country moaning freedoms infringed, no, remotely over.

omg. That's beautiful. Soooo subtle. I‚Äôm you..at least think business stores gonna seriously consider making mask required enter.

The entire point vaccines allow exposure virus without suffering infection... Yes, going see damn near every human planet test positive virus - vaccinated among us almost entirely unaffected. That's winning looks like. Curious. news (namely Fox, OANN &amp; Newsmax) held liable part spreading disinformation? Fox noticeably changed tune yesterday. makes wonder maybe can.

What makes Biden special? think he's specifically aware think he's pushing hard right came office. 

My thoughts let die. choice, consequences would actually purge stupidity society Darwinism. moment made choice take vaccine (the unvaccinated called choice well), controlled actions. favorite thing try genuinely debate said something like ‚Äúyour dad says kiss better even I‚Äôm wearing mask‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt breeding feel like somehow covidiots make conspiracy theory around 99 percent dying unvaccinated like somehow plot kill basic science literacy. ever heard survival fittest? science, people's personal risk assessment risk tolerance. go pharmacy ask basic questions  explained match, efficacy wanes time, Israel vaccinated 65+ population first. see happens 2-3 months US/CA. depends tested vaccine delta,and taken time second dose account.

Thanks captain obvious I‚Äôm still finding hard sympathy assholes also much larger source infections grocery store. feel unsafe vaccination wear mask store avoid social gatherings. Nobody stopping odds catching covid would essentially none. one focusing one thing. think that's you. think COVID clearly inserting narrative people discussing. 

LE figure general health nation, high LE sick population, also low LE health population. 

People hyperfocusing, LE indicator underlying issues. think people focusing think LE number means something, goal achieve life, goal everyone needs achieve.

That for. keep strange thing self insert people want live long(Missing point LE entirely) should, guess trying frame narrative people selfish wanting live long, life great age, or. giving excuses less come ""I care old/elderly please stop making change life things people care weave narrative selfish, life sucks age one else care either!"".

I know might intend, that's saying. Ask 90% old people, want die. Yes terminal illness things change, would using anecdote bolster narrative.

People good lives, people live good lives age. joke things going downhill 50, point LE end goal.

A higher LE means better older age statistically speaking. it, instead people going downhill 50, start going downhill 60 etc etc etc.

It nothing individual people, people 90, 78, 80. people consequences higher LE, people always live ages.

LE Specifically tells old people statistically living to, way get population statistically get higher average life expectancy making everyone healthier improving medical care.

Moreover one thing people seem skip past, say ""Oh dropped 50% people died 70"".

If die younger age, weight life expectancy dying older age, know what's even funny?

You thinking death matters. Old people high chance dying COVID, age 70+ 20% higher.

What think chance long COVID ongoing issues COVID population is? Even higher 20%.

We already know 2-5% people suffer long covid ongoing complications, covids overall death rate 0.6%. understand huge wave ongoing issues older people, younger people, middle age people coming long term?

Why ""Hyper focusing"" death, something claim others LE(Which aren't, indicater)  assumption I'm impervious vaccinated, far less likely get it. do, I'm far less likely case bad enough go hospital *probably* far less likely pass others. 
That ""probably"" there's hard data official claim vaccinated lowers transmission. They're specifically studied personal outcomes. knowing diseases work: less symptoms = lower viral load = lower viral shedding. US Govt could mandate vaccines like France. It‚Äôs human nature, it‚Äôs America. friends countries 
(S Korea, Germany, New Zeland) governments took precautions profit faired much better 650,000 dead urban family conservative refusing vaccine. Sure, COVID making people sick, killing people. fact, odds low! vaccine MIGHT make feel unwell hours!

No matter going around them, vehemently object idea taking classic public health measures outbreak spots closing problematic large venues bringing back kind mask mandate gets compliance: universal one.

Their convenience important others lives - including children, immunocompromised, breakthrough victims - antivaxers.

That's ""over"" means. measles example doesnt compare well. Measles, unlike covid doesnt mutate degree coronavirus does. single measles shot likely protect life, flu vaccine may last season. reach levels protections, would need constantly vaccinate globally rate dont think possible. Question COVID-19 testing Olympics:

What COVID-19 testing rules Olympic athletes? get tested exhibit symptoms? vaccinated athletes tested extra special circumstances? athletes get tested every week/day/some interval, testing frequency apply vaccinated athletes well unvaccinated athletes?

I'm curious this, we're certainly hearing plenty vaccinated athletes testing positive, makes wonder asymptomatic, merely found COVID-positive testing required despite lack symptoms. Every time hear another athlete testing positive despite vaccinated, casts doubt efficacy vaccine, raise questions whether vaccinated really protected well claimed infection transmission risk.

I got Pfizer regimen completed early April, like I'm skeptical efficacy myself, stories start raise questions. center, city‚Äôs centrists vitriolic us. Good luck enforcing point. Vaccinated people fight back hard that. compassion right way go. came saying ‚Äúthose dumb shits‚Äù unvaccinated would dig heels. Compassion understanding lead people changing minds getting vaccinated. understand people can't get head. point Darwinism. bad many people don‚Äôt believe science. last year schools kids eating unmasked classrooms outbreak would limited kids class.

This GOD AWFUL IDEA, space front classroom outside could eat instead idiotic schoolboard risked kids lives nothing.

Cheers homeschooling families US capable homeschooling. Yea lab got Pfizer around time 15 people, 1 symptoms last day second dose. Even fever aches. vast majority people feel little reaction. Good luck enforcing that... ...Vaccine ""shedding""? wtf even thing? hahahaha... Marlene real one  check see J&amp;J before?  Already lost friend really surprised anti-vax, largely liberal (given virus politicized Trump/Republicans largely across major party, left-right lines).

It also caused huge rift aunt anti-vax, thus 20 year-old (who's fairly liberal college, BTW), rest vaccinated family, point come grandma's recent birthday (which, good, they're vaccinated).  comment led believe read article?

I say again: hell would answer question asked AirBNB host? *none* business, there's many places stay put kind nonsense...  Absolutely, agree more. Zero covid nice like zero wars would nice, zero poverty. vax rate area 90% infections rising, need wear mask

90% never happen. I'm wearing masks rest life.

I stayed home 18 months. wore mask. got vaccine. I'm done protecting people want protect themselves. ‚ÄúCan‚Äù says nothing rate frequency something occurs - get hit car walking street - doesn‚Äôt make rational never walk street This... I'm probably getting third August.  think US mandated vaccines order go cafes museums, reaction would same. states would probably sue federal government overreach refuse enforce requirement. 

Even states went along it, individual cafe owners would probably actively undermine it. would pretend check vaccine cards they'd hand fake ones door pretense. 

Not everywhere, would happen. 

I think thing going play little little. I've two events asked vaccine proof far. Every place I've been, restaurants, stores, etc. made masks optional ask vaccinations. Individual employers may require vaccine employees. Schools, even know yet. 

I think simple blanket mandatory vaccine campaign whole country, we'd done already. 

I like idea incentives think eventually convert people, ones want miss fun they're unvaccinated. mean, capitalism first foremost tax stupidity... Spot brother going release true death toll 350k deaths?

Source:  lab leak imply conspiracy, suggests accident. 

The fact virus emerged within spitting distance China's largest lab investigating coronaviruses seems like awfully big coincidence. much ""simpler"" (hence Occam's razor) complex theories multi-animal transmission wet market. 

These labs sorts safety equipment, protocols, failsafes... clear present danger leak. 

I think we'll ever know sure, dismiss accident lab possibility conspiracy (as many media have) disingenuous.   ok guys , Maccas still open...
And kebab shops ...üñï chances money insurance. another medical bankruptcy. 100k hospitalizations week height mandatory masking. 

Also ‚Äúprevent‚Äù ‚Äúdelay‚Äù different concepts; people don‚Äôt accept solution period social distancing cases merely delayed prevented.  go well. much sentiment, call someone like - right. Everyone choice, group whole feel safe, collectively could cancel. Plus, 1 person group, knows many others would encounter trip also unvaccinated. plan another trip, different time, set friends feel comfortable with. Policy makers put resources trying un-stall American vaccination campaign. farm upstate say ? New Zealand well   Americans. Americans fully vaccinated single shot. It‚Äôs 23% population way they‚Äôre noisy seems like they‚Äôre larger number. It‚Äôs late many point. Call loan need be, excess doses exported. I'm sure many Caribbean, Central South American countries would appreciate them. Look dont want take deep dive politics ive got good hunch biden voters vaccinated trump voters.

And, predict right, delta variant demolish mostly unvaccinated category. Good point , saying goes. ‚Äúyour freedom ends Someone else‚Äôs freedom begins‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

This def applies pandemics. freedom believe moon made cheese doesn‚Äôt hurt neighbours. 

going around coughing delta v Covid does. people cannot convinced, let alone make sense, 100% approve feel well jab, get placebo. Unfortunately, host US. Exactly. uninformed know none works. people say ""masks work like still able smell farts underwear."" üò£ [Australia pun. flew right head.  fully vaxxed though :)

Nope. Two weeks go good buddy Covid expose positive rates going week nj we‚Äôll see happen next vaccine available before?

Plus pro, understand proper PPE selection use. young kind can't even stop constantly sticking fingers face holes. wish insurance companies would start this. really dont understand Americans. access effective vaccine entire world yet lot chose get it. sad time frustrating read articles like this. ‚ÄúFacts logic‚Äù - don‚Äôt here. already see mass protests coming. would think... Except: proves vaccines work Delta I've started get Facebook arguments people, convince *them* rather show ridiculous arguments people may stumble across bullshit. 

Through I've found people try dispute information provide links legitimate organizations (CDC, MSKCC, WHO, etc) completely contradict they're saying, showing misinformation also people ignorant idea process correct information. \*guitar riff No. Many athletes didn‚Äôt get vaccinated fear day two fatigue would mess training schedule. reasoning, mine.  studies J&amp;J frustratingly crap. Small sample sizes questionable lab methodologies. much stronger person coping that. Much respect gratitude. Trump screwed brains. Department Health reporting 2,326 cases COVID-19 3-day period.

It sound bad realize Mississippi 3 million residents. 

Los Angeles County 10 million residents recorded 1,000 cases day week. You‚Äôre right; I‚Äôve never thought morbid humor coping mechanism. Reminds comedians they‚Äôre often depressed inside humor cope. imagine would feel way given antivaxxer mentality. Pandemic 1917-1918 H1N1 still around. Lot people antibodies though.

Viruses really hard eliminate.

Think HCov OC43 - might responsible Russian Flu pandemic late 1800s. still around today, giving babies elderly pneumonia generally bad far lethal cold everyone else. Would trust sort medical ""cure"" advice created Trump cronys?

If experience misfortune contracting symptomatic Covid, injecting disinfectant trying get UV light inside body?

Trump never came vaccine. okayed bill authorized funding vaccine research. That's ""Operation Warp Speed"" about. 

Incidentally, first effective vaccine, technology involved, created Germany, women immigrated Turkey. Probably not; live Canada high number people getting vaccinated, especially province, personally I‚Äôve found healthcare far less accessible here. Yes free, wait list family doctor years long regularly don‚Äôt go doctor things would US. Overall would rather know neighbors friends access emergency healthcare won‚Äôt bankrupt well easy access whatever, trade offs ok me. 

Anyway think it‚Äôs reflection politics access healthcare. countries public healthcare also typically countries liberal leaning governments less politics around COVID. Running free. can't run, walking also free.

Eating less literally saves money. drinking less.

It's fallacy say options unhealthy shelling tons money gym membership, bicycle, rowing membership. Time make laws then. new phenomenon laws ill equipped deal it. medical student here, there's difference vaccine takes hour day two, tops, whereas changes risk obesity CVD requires long-term lifestyle shifts legitimately difficult many people living, especially, obesogenic environments.

It's less easy feel immediate sympathy individual chooses get vaccine vs. someone whose entire life works instances. harder judge result personal choice instances, well. I'm reading article linked, charged particles lower penetration charge-neutral particles, indicating improved filtration performance charged particles. (Fig 5)


According [this Furthermore, charged uncharged filters, phenomenon different. electret filters, filtration efficiency observed neutralized particles. It‚Äôs really easy anyone get healthy exercising watching diet. don‚Äôt need rich that. could done. political there.

I'm tired excuse. made poor choices deserve consequences. dying good thing means spread antivaxx nonsense. 

We harden suffering, enough die reshape electorate need BRUTALLY oppress them. They're cancer COVID America's chemo therapy. leaves quite bunch people delta ravage,

And going get worse world takes sweet time getting vaccines poorer countries virus continues mutate.  Damn guess wear masks social distance public case vaccinated person sheds vaccine onto them. point is, many vulnerable hosts among unvaccinated drive ""surge?"" Natural Infections count vaccination right, correct? So.. I'm guessing masking/distancing really protect people, since otherwise antibodies now? Tbh surprise me. There's lot containment + PPE resources allocated COVID wards vs general wards, least hospitals around me. get wrong, try stay top things, containment ability COVID/icu wards vs general floor/other floors (such obstetrics).  Ah yes, problem organized religions. Misinformation, bias, racism, plain hate violence anyone fitting mold delta actually concerning vaccine evasive?


Most studies indicating delta deadly alpha rest variants. 

Delta however transmissible.

Covid going mutate unless vaccinate 85% global population. may hit types numbers western countries it‚Äôs unlikely happen developing nations. makes future variants inevitable. kids can't get vaccinated. family member immunocompromised. idiots ""care"" about. Didn‚Äôt India ‚Äúbeat‚Äù COVID? keep seeing charts it‚Äôs pretty much gone bullshit false info? heard ivermectin played large part could also BS. hopefully pretty stupid shit. time SeaLion fuck them. talking person, doubt would even work. would turn person martyr mind. upcoming school year lead similar surge

With delta, transmissible last year. Yes, said, know that. never seen actual study well antigen tests work detecting actively contagious cases. Probably there's also little information exactly someone contagious (or degree). applaud compassion; tell true caregiver. Good you, comment talking people see that. mean impossible skin color something it? Maybe darker people typically less vitamin affects outcome? think believing virus racial bias necessarily racist believe. I'm saying believe.

I'm probably going get downvoted oblivion.  Yup.

Especially since nothing new.
I'd rather show bunch loose paper.

Because vaccine passport not, change requirement countries trying enter. getting downvoted sad. school science class

The scientific method taught high school science courses. think problem people pay attention school all. think really may something here. misinterpreted post explaining part people justify making decisions ultimately going damage health. know I'm one people one gives shit I'm destroying body who's going stop me?

Eventually, COVID become another illness, pandemic people still smoking tobacco, binge drinking, couch potatoes, ODing drugs we'll stop pretending like everyone's life important. start shutting Fox News, OAN new outlets. ...but tried.

Saying tried generous. 

1. waited long giving proper endorsement vaccine. 
2. emphasize importance vaccination. 
3. vaccination drive started falter, stepped ensure followers fully understood wants get vaccinated.

His energetic vaccination quote wanted make sure everyone gave credit fast-tracking vaccines. Fast-tracking vaccines least one thing well.  Unfortunately people selfish healthcare workers, teachers, frontline staff- expendable. I‚Äôm trying really hard argue people get vaccinated it‚Äôs disheartening. Depends think risks long covid kids outweigh risks continued lockdown. certain areas live avoid winter. city 15 miles me, large public library. homeless would winter. Avoided. Good friends sick? Avoided. kids, gamble lives health want. parents won't. Pro life Christian pro life groups generally largest adopters donate orphanages whatnot. sure sentiment comes afraid of. trust ""sources"" literally lives. Even sources warning say top page trust medical advise... poignant. one lucky ones get long covid. recall correctly could high 20% people recover. 

Maybe people need watch first-hand accounts long covid does. Better dying ... get it, sex friend stroke encephalitis something insane back end February 2021. spent 6 weeks hospital visitors another 6 weeks rehab visitors.

He said even became aware going on, even realizing bad enough visitors, understand scope situation driven home past deserted city.

(He's infinitely better now, hope well.) guess still missing point? many people still vulnerable virus? forget natural infections.. constantly told ""we already"" ""true infections 40x higher confirmed infections"" yet... there's still enough vulnerable hosts left drive ""surge?"" How? natural infection count vaccination right, correct? I'm also told lot too. I'm confused, among even unvaccinated, still many people left antibodies? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

School system started last year virtual, hybrid, 4 days week full person. switched 4 days week cases among person students went 72% 10 days.

Like you, I'm playing safe kids, thought sharing might provide reassurance. Can‚Äôt fix stupid vote out. 

This Republican Party it‚Äôs ignorant base. 

Worthless through. leave room, see person that‚Äôs really suffering, regretful choice made.

Which direct opposition informed consensus without practical grounding.

Sorry, sympathy. speaking truth friend ! since unvaccinated largely young people (and many Covid someone earlier mentioned), won‚Äôt cases severe? Isn‚Äôt backed hospitalization death data UK?
Can‚Äôt also seen good thing? Since youth ones getting infected, disease rather mild people getting immunity Covid? Yes, look proportions vaccinated people amongst general population, look estimated vaccines efficacy, calculate expect share hospitalised people be, compare actually observed.

Seems like numbers expected thus confirms estimated efficacy vaccines want feel way someone small town south *know* people. see horrible nasty stuff post social media. I've person hear see bigoted things say look self satisfaction face it.

I'm celebrating I'm done caring plight horrible people completely unnecessarily brought demise often basking misery others. France that. Anything non-essential require show proof vaccination. Can't see happen muh freedom America. travel re-halted? Yes - it‚Äôs excellent success story vulnerable nursing home population asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic. Keep mind, populations highest mortality rates - believe previous population studies much 100 times higher rates young healthy people. Many folks 80+ multiple preexisting conditions. Lmao course would say this. 
You sound like character Bran  *putin_thumbs_up.gif* addition original Carnet de vaccination I've since birth lists childhood vaccines, circa 2010 given ""vaccine passport"" travel clinic. conveniently passport sized comes protective case. ""vaccine passport"" copy every vaccine I've ever since birth, plus new travel vaccines I've received, including yellow fever vaccine certificate. super useful, great keeping track I've received time boosters, easy carry traveling... Crazy something like suddenly controversial people. talking different article highlighted people raging nurses doctors basically... insist ""it's flu"" get intubated death bed story needs shared far wide. People need wake up. putting risk. letting virus mutate faster get worse. solve problem vaccine misinformation? solve problem media political people talking sides mouths consequences? two sides this. One side right. One side actively getting people killed. Vaccines work end story. mother literally makes shit talking people (mainly siblings me). She‚Äôll say family doctor said X, really said didn‚Äôt like it. didn‚Äôt even talk wants people think did. She‚Äôll say friend family member experienced something ridiculous, press pull random name someone hasn‚Äôt spoken years tell don‚Äôt know them. she‚Äôll say ‚Äúthis happened friend,‚Äù really read random post group Facebook someone doesn‚Äôt know, random unsourced disinformation meme facebook. 

Meanwhile, little sister went mother get yearly checkup, doctor begged mother get vaccinated. two siblings are, I, parents not. still hasn‚Äôt gotten it, despite man essentially begging stop dumb.

It‚Äôs immensely frustrating. Education. Education. Education. Education. way mess think of. Invest education. Subsidise university places. papers references others? Well body saw threat went batshit crazy last 12 hours. side effects diminished. Slight headache slightly higher body temp. People scattered would bedding admitted waiting hospital beds. think needed ICU they'd somewhere hallway less serious cases might luck stuck hall oxygen feed.

Our hospital like precovid. I'm 2019 admitted acute pancreatitis spent six hours hanging hall waiting bed. lengthy wait seen. time got bed 12 hours got ER. shudder think like covid spiked.

Though also severe gallstones tone pain hanging hallway gurney morphine drip. chill it. retrospective blood sampling? likely. Secondary outbreak loss control coincident variant emergence well, case P.1 sweat it. Lots people get nervous. nurse already forgotten you. Mr fartbox, 

You mistaken I've wondered this. Many people know still working home, things delivered instead going stores, wear masks go around people, etc. vaccinated, trusting others around would rather suck longer risk family. vaccinated low possible exposure virus still counted ""didn't catch it"" group along people regularly crowded areas work, recreation, etc. thought window time person contagious. Maybe exposed outside window? literally said GG's Aww took time day check profile. I‚Äôm touched ü•∞ often zero critical thinking skills analyze ""research"". Basically, start idea seek confirm it. pat back ""being right"". brain confirmation bias... LoNg CoViD That's... exact opposite article says. They're overcome regret believing ""just flu"" ""vaccines dangerous"", etc.

Generally speaking, death bed, people remorseful life choices got point. maybe incubators, sacrafice children may die vaccine save older people, call? Yes! Real. here. Well people desire that, first all

And second all, people US poor education comes math/statistics

Lots people zero clue rate is, much less exponential growth latest surge seem bane unvaccinated. Darwinism work seems. usual exceptions children young get legit medical reasons. Hopefully mostly live areas high percentages vaccinated people I'm glad happening, hope signals change network. 

But even gets people vaccinated, frustrates people listened Hannity, instead many immunologists begging people get vaccine! Hannity relevant credentials justify listening opinion vaccines! done getting people vaccinated? vaccinated, everyone live? always variants. never going go away. Even U.S. gets 100% vaccinated, many still get always possible... goal reduce severity symptoms and, we're lucky, lessen rate transmission. literally billions unvaccinated people world continue long time. answer shut society? that's answer, mean vaccines work?

I feel like I'm crazy pills sub, swear... hope I‚Äôm wrong you‚Äôre right. guess we‚Äôll see happens winter. Good luck üòä ‚ÄúThere stringent rules vaccination regular testing‚Äù

Try saying Arizona.

From see, goes far beyond ""hesitancy"". Many people litterally terrified vaccine, based absolutely insane conspiracy theories. could bad worse winter wave would still refuse vax. Makes sense. Thank clarification. guess don‚Äôt care vaccinated people spreading delta thing. person processing virus (ie infected) they‚Äôre able spread. dude I'm worried dieing covid I'm worried getting sick ending hospital bill can't pay. Also I'm hella dumb brain fog sound fun. wife teaches 2 year olds daycare, 5 them, keep masks fine.

Uh, yes? Education badly broken country. [30% US adults Level 1 Level 1 requires ""simple processes involving counting, sorting, performing basic arithmetic operations, understanding simple percents 50%""

Think that. 1 3 adults USA cannot understand math much counting, simple arithmetic, understanding percent is.

Great - 2/3rds USA cannot much calculate percent fraction using whole numbers

Nobody, almost literally, gotten vaccinations doctor's office. Far less 1% gone doctor's office get vaccine. People getting vaccine free pharmacies cities/towns.

There 150 Walarts across Alabama, another 150 Walgreens, another hundred pharmacies give vaccine FREE. counting hundreds local municipalities/towns/cities etc. also give free. would cool true tho. would love vaccine super spreader.

""‚ÄúThey cry. tell didn‚Äôt know. thought hoax. thought political. thought certain blood type certain skin color wouldn‚Äôt get sick. thought ‚Äòjust flu‚Äô. wrong. wish could go back. can‚Äôt. thank go get vaccine. go back office, write death note, say small prayer loss save lives.‚Äù

I much guess skin color political party is. misinformation among group rampant indeed... Yall need downvote see report it. hospitalist? Never seen term used before. still sympathy end day they're people think they're what's best them. recently lost friend 35 years old Delta variant. vaccinated whatever reason. bad health anything, maybe little overweight people. even right leaning, think thought need he'd fine given age health. Exact reasons matter though cause he's gone family left scrambling. point pandemic misinformation, former U.S. president. Really created mess take decades even get base point Kids 12 (yet).

And even vaccinated, still propagate virus time catch time body fights off.

Non vaccinated people contagious longer, increase risk significantly. Nice comment, productive. Damn, that's crazy. Try again.

What think I'm ""trying""? *Sigh* tracks  Good idea. ignore cases among vaccinated (since don‚Äôt pose much threat) base dying

I think this, exactly--they know put thumbs scales elections.

The issue stock market. dropping Delta, scares people Fox/OANN/GOP. Buddy I'm Alabama say need get more. rich daddies working NASA Huntsville. Huge parts state practically third-world country. people nothing. whole school districts completely poverty line. Take drive west part state sometime... make like every country experiment, countries took risk vaccinating young, didn't, they're experiments, answers known, would differentiation.

Only difference see UK possibly struggling keep demand. may decide next order vaccines would better use old 12-17 death rate still low despite vaccines.

I believe likely decision made using risk reward giving vaccines younger people. Oh good, people arrived. 

Sorry making world safer place literally way could. know summation is? metaphors also confuse you? mask optional. Kids 7 5. I‚Äôm worried this.

I‚Äôll take chances antibodies, covid effect me, never stopped running year didn‚Äôt even stop that. following [blog seems right 50s, see 46% population unvaccinated make 87% admissions. Meanwhile, 21% population fully vaccinated make 4% admissions. tells us risk unvaccinated people 50 11 times higher* risk vaccinated aged 50 plus, see 5% population unvaccinated make 34% admissions. Meanwhile, 79% population fully vaccinated make 43% admissions. tells us risk unvaccinated people 50 12 times higher* risk vaccinated people. peak Delta well!  better 60%? Vaccines successfully trialed people age 12, accounts 90% population Japan. possible get 80% full population covered issues widespread anti-vax notions. Save political crap another thread Agreed! take vaccine yourself. others Duh? saying car crashes still happen even 60% people wear seatbelts. 

I mean, yeah. Infections still happen. least vaccine much higher chance mild symptoms, any.

In news, sky blue. read discussions seems booster people J&amp;J shot going doctor/pharmacy/vacc site getting single shot Pfizer Moderna add 'boost' protection already have.  friends dad 55 year old dad died COVID family says hospital lying ‚Ä¶. sad, sick twisted. hard part good people deceived. cut mother this.

I doubt vaccine- covid denier but, given time, says whatever comes head validate herself.

She'll say something deny week later - soon realises accused action recognises negative, she'll deny can't believe bad person.

It's infuriating. shitty memory, give fuck calls liar something I've seen eyes. Yeah unvaxxed 97.5% ""effective"" analysis.

At time, 2.5% unvaxxed testing positive 0.08% vaxxed testing positive ... imply **96.8%** (1 - (0.08 / 2.5)) efficacy? Though course assumes getting tested rate, behaviors, etc. Assumptions obviously true would require much analysis untangle (if even done). really pisses off, keeps feeling compassion anti-vaxxers healthy enough get vaccinated wanted to. They're ones risking well vulnerable members society - cannot get vaccine themselves. know woman got liver transplant 3 years ago doctors told get vaccine (yet, least). Thankfully live part country high vaccination rates. worth keeping mind study lumps Beta Gamma one category. given whole lot Beta Canada, vast majority numbers likely Gamma. despite similarities terms mutations, two variants' ability evade immunity necessarily same.  evidence blood types, there? makes assume Olympic village vaccinated anywhere else? Lots athletes countries vaccines readily available lots athletes countries proudly announced vaxxed. little late, man contributed mass death don‚Äôt see all. news organization Canada anti vax? political party anti vax? prominent Conservative Canada - Doug Ford vocal pro-vax leader.

The political thing federal conservatives complaining vaccination efforts slow. 

It‚Äôs public health issue Canada political issue. It‚Äôs crazy - also done past 16 months reading doctors it. work medium engineering office factory 150. 3 4 us regularly mask since restrictions lifted. Delta going major damage anyone gets it, late. you‚Äôre describing us healthcare system thought joke based conversation education, damn. Seated is. fair, stayed home borderline ruined global economy protect people almost 2 years now, need stay home longer, that's fair we've done enough far IMO. Sigh, anything tearing apart American family, it‚Äôs bootstrapping die. Grandparents can‚Äôt even watch grandkids there‚Äôs deadly disease going around. think people see good news optimism privilege better deny everyone allow wrong hands. goes climate. Thank sharing this! LOL. That's big IF. people south vaccinated. everyone dies long covid kid grow fewer resources support. (the south fewest medicaid expansions even kids)

But let burn you'all want.  content largely fear-mongering. least, early indications say vaccinated people largely protected long-term sequelae. Whoever person ignoring science. true, thats would unexpected general. works current vaccines target different variant right dominant strain, disadvantage. ""The fact they're still talking pandemic year later means really pandemic. psy-ops campaign!"" hard argue ""logic"" like that.  white people black people? You‚Äôre wrong

The CDC specifically states 80% protection asymptomatic infection specifically states 94% effectiveness asymptomatic cases I'd say selfish pride bigger factor Right?!? I‚Äôm nurse too. ONE covid patient apologized exposing virus. It‚Äôs just: 

‚Äú*Help me, can‚Äôt breathe, don‚Äôt think oxygen working, anyway turn oxygen up?? It‚Äôs working‚Äî please!! followed rules, knows got covid? It‚Äôs mystery! Turn oxygen up!!*‚Äù :::::gasps air, dies 2 days later:::::

(Sorry I‚Äôve become cynical) We‚Äôve critical thinking issue long time latest way it‚Äôs bitten us.  mess. yeah, originators misinformation nuts. time, there's also operation Infektion Russian agents posing US citizens intentionally spreading Covid misinformation weaken divide country. know how, wish US could find way address kind malicious propaganda source. point we'll stop caring variants there's going new ones years like flu. Spanish Flu still circulation mutates much need update vaccines every year, yet give names flu's variants. exactly what's going happen Covid we've reached point virus little deadly really need care transmissible is.

At moment, Delta variant causing deaths transmissible (more cases = deaths even smaller percentage), comparatively much less deadly previous variants, points towards virus gradually mutating adapt new human host (a living host better virus dead one). seems like we're going direction. Whether reach endemic stage soon several years yet determine, that's we're headed. Might something people wanting follow simple precautions. #45 wanting lose money tourism, hence international travel ban enacted. College GTA (in Florida). son 2. pediatrician recommended mask know large university cannot mandate masks vaccines. person summer teaching said none students wearing masks even come sick. So, follow son's pediatrician's recommendations.

They‚Äôve 71 cases tens thousands athletes staff, got Japan. Everything seems working fine. Jim Carey even say ""my bad"". left restarted acting career people love again. right side spreading rhetoric entire time. would great. momentary lapse judgment yesterday read comments news story mask mandate schools. Oh my, mindless rhetoric ridiculous almost funny. Confederate flags, mind-boggling ""logic"", embarrassing, sad, dangerous.  Let turn around you: getting misinformation?

I'll leave personal answer essentially Pitt said. support making mandatory USA never gonna happen. Lack trust ""the establishment"". Particularly federal government educated experts know. appreciate Dr Cobia's plea speak doctor know. also important medical professionals doctors nurses need fully informed advocating everyone best protect families. 

They may trust media experts tv nurse family doctor seeing years chance break misinformation broadcast news outlets/opinion piece/infotainment. Agreed. Considering source misinformation often elected government officials, pastors, friends. relatives‚Ä¶it‚Äôs tough escape bubble. really amazing see posts like this; I've stumbled parallel universe. hope come people young remember politics 2016.

The Western world, US particular, *far* left ever (at least cultural issues; economics different matter entirely). point R\*public\*ns left issues D\*m\*crats 20 years ago ([g\*y cannabis obvious quantifiable examples).

You've year people tearing statues Columbus Abe Lincoln broadly supported one two main p\*rties, serious discussion tearing Mt Rushmore. would considered completely insane 20 years ago. R\*public\*ns (God, hate word filter) nominated tr\*nsgender candidate governor California. Imagine going back Bush years time machine telling people that. brainwashed?

Because change opinion facts come out. jury vaccination COVID. campaign ""slow spread"" enough population could get vaccinated eventually get virus end hospital. 

You either misunderstood drew conclusions parts understand. elementary aged, think districts defer AAP, CDC, etc. mask social distancing policies.  ‚Äúyelling fire movie theater‚Äù example public safety vs freedom speech this. topics agreed public health risk misinformation tolerated. Agreed. educated people extended family also anti-vax, conspiracy theory types.

I blame complete wrapping identity religion, politics local community. Disagreeing one aspect them, putting risk ostracized them. live area 90% people go kind church vote kind republican, vocally opposed that, see lose 90% friends, colleagues status small town.

The tribalism binding them, even logical thoughts. also literally wrote scripts snap slots soon became available. 
Now also point doses become better available Germany got first shot May, friends still waiting first dose. 
I willing take AZ back then, reasons many not, seems second dose BionTech means might need get third dose get green EU vaccination card. live mid Michigan. Work general motors. get free msu lions tickets time. ""It's great Michigan wolverine"" except really. I'll pour one well. thinking part it. part lot folks believe believe circle believes it. believing maybe cause ostracized. 

When say ‚Äúit‚Äù don‚Äôt mean anti vaccine rhetoric. could mean anything. Intentions matter. matters shots arms. observed prior weeks, Black Hispanic people received smaller shares vaccinations compared shares cases compared shares total population states. share vaccinations received Black people also continues smaller share deaths states, although states similar share deaths. share vaccinations received Hispanic people similar higher share deaths reporting states, although states continues lower. example, California, 29% vaccinations gone Hispanic people, account 63% cases, 48% deaths, 40% total population state.

How California failing serve Hispanic population beyond me. Goes right obviously incorrect handwaving math drawer. Australia covid-hotels anyone coming in, believe mandatory 2-week quarantine said hotels. positive cases escape setup, cities usually go 5-10 day lockdown carrier found everyone tested/isolated.

I'm sure (and many countries) wish vaccine quantity got US  sure you‚Äôre getting downvoted; it‚Äôs legitimate question given quick delta transmits. 

What don‚Äôt know antibodies would work delta re-infections variants, become dominant.

It‚Äôs certainly optimistic perspective, variant much alarm regarding transmissibility.  vaccines even cleared use December January. yes, FDA allowed makers start production months ahead time millions available release date. That's hoarding. 

We already done vaccinating everybody USA cranking vaccines countries. can't... people part get vaccines. That's definitely looks like Spain. huge surge unvaccinated adolescents young adults (which past peak still insane levels) incidence rate still increasing among older (and close 100% vaccinated) population.

In instance unvaccinated due eligible yet vaccine, whereas partying like crazy despite unvaccinated due egoistic inconsiderate assholes. case clearly shows Covid go rampant unvaccinated parts population severely impacts even vaccinated. Look chart others noted, deaths following case count, means vaccines job. don‚Äôt see reason US wouldn‚Äôt follow trend, especially considering higher rate people vaccinated mRNA vaccines. 

The data coming Israel looked huge grain salt considering keep stating numbers offering absolutely data back up.  Teachers across US made sacrifices last year sake students, continue so, spite hateful rhetoric right educational system. Yeah misinformation thing huge deal. people say oh correct info go look it. Well ‚Äúthink‚Äù they‚Äôre reading truthful accurate like people know read think accurate.
Some nuts many really think they‚Äôre reading accurate, read believe accurate.
It‚Äôs mess really. won‚Äôt able reversed time, getting misinformation people.  Understood natural immunity still way helping reach herd immunity. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt get vaccinated, know subset population never that. 

So - reiterate - I‚Äôm pro vaccination. Get it. However among us don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll, may help us reach herd immunity difficult ( costly ) path. alone. think lot people seriously considering going back stringent social distancing much coverage variant blew past two weeks, health experts saying everything far ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù. People tend forget that. Yes.  Things won‚Äôt linear. drop ton go little it‚Äôs still progress. 

We need get ballpark winter numbers start concerned hospital system

I‚Äôd stunned hospitalizations even approach 50% peak levels send jail that‚Äôs assault battery, don‚Äôt know know it‚Äôs one them. science agree stating. testing vaccines versus delta highly effective slightly lower original strain. numbers coming Israel match studies done delta variant sad pandemic politicized, one party promoting disinformation constituency. beyond stupid. think point scenario ""requiring tests unvaccinated vaccinated"" still probably statistical blip. individual companies venues. Probably enough say ""unvaccinated tested higher rate"". 
In general things carry much like since well vaccines available. (Most) people go get tested they're symptomatic exposed known case. Asymptomatic cases missed vaxxed unvaxxed populations. know getting downvoted this. I'm starting think lockfown skeptic types invading sub antimask bull shit. prevelant last weeks, antivax/antimask parents started showing yup School Board meetings across country demanding unvaccinated kids wear masks School upcoming year even though CDC, American Academy Pediatrics think should. No, socialization education. one thing say though, don‚Äôt know ‚Äúwho talk to,‚Äù strikes culture operational issue workplace, able be, needs be, clear without ineffable chance factors like person social cues.

I getcha. actually pretty ok, ramp bit hard figure knows what. jobs easier chatted people work. start asking people want vaccine, like trying walk mud. sister also believe vaccines fact wants travel, gotten it. asked why, went long diatribe veterinarians wanting prescribe unnecessary vaccines make money. (she owned dogs life). Basically, think trying say trust pharmaceutical companies, lesser extent, things medical. brought Monsanto. arguments coherent. 

She one new-age types especially susceptible falling conspiracy hole.  get it. trust Big Pharma Medical industrial complex either, capable nuance. believe vaccine exception rule. demonstrates scientists world get together make world better. shows things could be, things be. Sure still profit motive behind lot decisions, quite lot selfishness greed rich countries, rainbows butterflies. Far it. come vaccine record time prove salvation.

Can imagine first virus (known wild type) Delta variant???? 
Dick cheese! changes anything? Delta already dominant strain worldwide. anything, Olympic village one safest place world right (with vaccinated, tested, checked etc). 

The issue Olympics right now, amount unvaccinated people first world countries. Delta hits , mother die, unfortunately. harsh reality. Exactly. fraction breakthroughs/(breakthroughs + unvaccinated positives) order protection goes:

Vaccinated covid

Vaccinated

Unvaccinated covid

Unvaccinated Hm, I‚Äôve never situation probably can‚Äôt imagine state mind. Maybe say, rational cry help, raw desperation. 

In bit good news, second last hold wife‚Äôs office getting vaccinated tomorrow. Three antivaxxers office gotten vaccinated since delta hit. They‚Äôre scared. 

So stories do, fact, help push people scrap sense them. I‚Äôm glad doctors still sharing. group, suspect greater risk? point here, know it. crazy thing mom certainly always like this. really didn‚Äôt start becoming anti-vax maybe decade ago first got Facebook. family pediatrician doctor since 3 years old. nearly 25 years total two younger siblings. youngest sibling year two away aging out. doctor watch firsthand mom gone deep end unable anything it.

She threw full-on fit 18 recommending Gardasil vaccine me.

Now I‚Äôm adult insurance shopping around primary care doc, refuse use anyone father recommend. front line worker either get vaccinated go find another line work. Full stop. Every country public healthcare see gastro doctor get endoscopy won‚Äôt able see one till April thats youll end time covid endemic. never going away, new varient every year end time. Forcing people wear masks rest *their* lives selfish best. may able immunized local public health office. assumed requirement participate Olympics would vaccinated, case?

No that's pretty widespread information coverage paying attention all.  Well public health authorities seem differ consequences do. least Canada everyone 12+ getting vaccinated.

We see happens UK, certainly interesting experiment. Oh man, even old. I'm sorry losing family member way. state COVID hotline, nurse advice hotline, call get advice vaccines, resources finding correct information medical professionals. Yeah died cytokine storm. covid. Drowning liquid. covid liquid. Big difference.

Obligatory /s apparently That's insane... words honest... ""they‚Äôre still person thinks made best decision could information have""

You mean information doctors, epidemiologist understand stuff? mean people clearly smarter rest us? Really feel like Facebook done policing sued misinformation spread, well right winged outlets anti vax. need legal ramifications Simpler still mandate vaccine places get ""tracked"" anyway, eg work school. understanding like high 80's low 90's efficeny rate could wrong much greater? many years? HGEN COVID treatment!
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ there's UK hit 90% adults, even final percent slow burn. refusal vaccinate children scuppers whole thing.  India, estimating death toll pandemic 10 times official number, potentially 4.7 million people. Indian people would loved able get vaccines nincompoops turning down. Thanks (small piece of) info. I've wondering got enrolled trials.

Do know kind risky wanted? Always wondered trial participants wore masks, distanced, etc - mostly bc, did, - certainly changes meaning statistics efficacy, transmission, etc. Oh makes much sense thank you! Must hard families see decisions causing needless pain.  People understand fact take 2 weeks show symptoms makes deadly, well imo. 

Like, get manage determine contact two weeks ago, think able remember many people contact last two weeks??? Hell barely remember everyone interacted yesterday! ware mask time got it, would huge amount people infected two weeks me. 

Note: deliver lumber building supply store, maybe interact higher number people, there's plenty people interact even more. gotten bad hospital social worker know says unvaccinated people die home. burden society give fuck about. number means nothing. 2 people died covid 1 fully vaccinated, that's 50% deaths fully vaccinated. still small number compared general population percent population that's fully vaccinated. anyone surprised? guy another corrupt UN politician public health leader. outcry removal? Maybe world leaders want useless figurehead? terrible. 

For comparison, biggest drop life expectancy since WWII. opioid epidemic caused overall drop 78.9 2014 78.6 2017. 1.5 years devastating. Status quo today‚Äôs society. Selfish without empathy.  It‚Äôs hard least help create database vaccination businesses entertainment want use vaccine passports use them, instead relying cards. Masks could optional places. countries much drastic measures, isn‚Äôt I‚Äôm asking for. like explain mindsets. never thought way. Thanks. Thanks advice. need get test anything else. don‚Äôt usually get cold anything illness-wise summer I‚Äôm bit concerned say least. sure downvoted. It‚Äôs accurate.   feel bad healthcare workers unvaccinated children medically fragile cannot get vaccinated. feel zero sympathy refuse get vaccinated so.
Man protect kids. like last year. Vaccinations help quite lot. Agree 100%.  Despite timing, way better getting vaxx. Lmao good day batbro don‚Äôt need vaccine already need vaccine. thought high antibodies back Jan (60% New Delhi). Couldn‚Äôt hold back costly second wave I‚Äôm going use prop. I‚Äôm going follow science myself. definitely i‚Äôm done arguing you. ...who fuck would tell AirBNB host whether received COVID vaccine? lmao... Fire department? Quite tragic.

Fair enough. Goodbye. correct. honestly know brain crossed wires. Morning brain fog. 

I think would lower 15,900 100% vaccinated population. amount virus circulating would drop. know number would be, though.  Im planning international travel Asia next year january. 
Im living europe.(I purchase ticket yet since Im afriad cancelled worst wave virus still plaguing world high levels.)

Wondering hopes travel getting ""normalize"" period? Honestly, might work. CMS allowed insurance companies deny coverage unvaccinated COVID positive people, would powerful incentive get vaccinated. true. asked doctor. said nobody knows. got Pfizer anyway. No, send prison committing assault.

On internet, makes look like toolbag. got second Pfizer yesterday top J&amp;J.

‚ÄúA days later call time death,‚Äù continued Cobia Facebook, ‚ÄúI hug family members tell best way honor loved one go get vaccinated encourage everyone know same.‚Äù

Then comes quote read ‚Äúthank go get vaccine.‚Äù would give GoFundMe unless specifically said vaccinated. dont know life expectancy calculated, ok? mean, covid killed 600,000 plus counting US. large portion elderly. naturally skew overall life expectancy downwards? another years, go back up? I'm sure majority people gotten vaccinated feel way do. Certain groups keep proclaiming want things ""go back normal"" ""no new normal"" they're ones making take damn long fix.

Looking jump alpha delta shows us virus got dangerous, dont think waiting option suddenly get Imagine primed immune system annual COVID boosters, undoubtedly better every single year.

There bigger problem people.  


Probably simple serious intelligence issue. lack thereof think good argument zombies caused cancer vaccine lol evidence zero covid countries plan approve vaccines 18s?

e.g. Pfizer approved 12-15 US months yet places otherwise approved Pfizer 16+. fact, countries like UK ruled stage due unclear benefit relative lose hope. solutions need work get buy-in them. hate Facebook. used keep friends far away nothing adds MLM. fair, American children receive education whether public private, failure understand value vaccines indictment public education system Damn straight. Visiting unvaccinated worth possible risk harming others.  


IMO, anyway. feel people. can‚Äôt imagine 20 years old living insular rural town parents listened Fox News entire life, small church teaches cosmic battle good versus evil vaccines side evil, never really good shot college leaving (and didn‚Äôt support Herculean effort would took). 

How break kind echo chamber? escape worldview views everything outside immediate experience suspicion fear?

I get angry unvaccinated sympathy. get much angry purveyors, snake oil salesman, grifters charlatans help shape worldview benefit. speak US, doubt canceling olympics would cause policy change US. Seems like vaccinated people hospital uk us , percentage wise. Who‚Äòs data believe? going on? worrisome. Please help clarify this. Thanks. Yep, mail, directly site.   can't refuse treatment now. See James Woods' brother.  mean winter '20? Yeah, 2 months ago sure thing behind us US. Delta low buy-in vaccinations community made stop reassess. 

All said hope blows able take trip. Maybe keep planning alternate plans ready well. Sending positive vibes. yep, odd it? mental. logic it. tool people use manipulate thinking others. actually even care potential life. tools, strings yank empty-headed puppets around with. Check numbers UK comparing first 50 days last wave one. Cases around deaths hospitalizations nowhere even close last wave. So... what's end game? Seriously asking. groups get vaccinated (lots kids probably become eligible fall, example). scenarios going away, example, immunocompromised individuals still going vulnerable even hit high levels vaccination. would stop masks distancing mind? Kind of. Technically anyone could go somewhere get 3rd shot recommended enough data collected 3 shots short succession. However, seen news personal accounts people immunocompromised able get 3rd shot recommended doctor antibodies shown low test. what's explanation people believe getting vaxxed dangerous getting vaxxed?  Honestly point, RT better news source, really pains say contagious variants sure. Much smaller population folks risk seriously ill though. 

Reasonable chance things flatten vs grow exponentially severe case side feel people. can‚Äôt imagine 20 years old living insular rural town parents listened Fox News entire life, small church teaches cosmic battle good versus evil vaccines side evil, never really good shot college leaving (and didn‚Äôt support Herculean effort would took). 

How break kind echo chamber? escape worldview views everything outside immediate experience?

I get angry unvaccinated sympathy. get much angry purveyors, snake oil salesman, grifters charlatans help shape worldview benefit. also surely people might tested positive symptoms therefore reason get tested. 

Which course good thing whole point.  really capitalize mRNA anything. ""messenger RNA"" - ribonucleic acid see masks vanish quickly, unfortunately.

We went 99% compliance maybe 5-10% usage month following mask mandate prematurely dropped. order tolerant society, tolerant must tolerate intolerant. realize received many vaccinations children?

Before modern medicine, close 1/2 children died reaching adulthood. Here's interesting article.  


There's good case law stuff too. God posts annoying. current cdc guidelines say fully vaccinated need wear mask situations. issue that, take them. Stop labeling people selfish stupid following cdc guidelines. Well, it‚Äôs twice contagious strain went around last year, even lots people fully vaccinated infected before, case numbers hospitalizations going back up, going down.

If healthy, fully vaccinated, live country healthcare complications long term won‚Äôt bankrupt repeatedly possibly ruin future plans marriage, kids, house maybe new car, it‚Äôs likely don‚Äôt scared much all.

If live country long term health problems ruin American Dream, would try get it, since many people gotten covid end neurological issues long term side effects.

Also, many 10% got many things shut down, indoor dining, half capacity, work home, etc. Many mitigation‚Äôs likely aren‚Äôt coming back, likely personal responsibility try avoid thing hope get it, doesn‚Äôt cause long term issues.

If family member high risk, might worth buying N95‚Äôs around case things get extra-fucked. Took long enough. Seems like everything said head gonna happen has. Everything happen, (such masking schools children) lagging taking long happen. humans always wait catastrophe taking action? I'm expert areas enough training basic K-12 science medical assisting nursing school know really what's up. common sense though me. I'm sure people struggling hard simple stuff. air, wear mask. HELPS control it, stop it. need help get. EVER children, (which happening debating hard it) attend public school. home school myself. work hard, mother MAKE WORK. enough internet resources this. can't kid exposed stupid people's kids. puts rest us danger household. Community longer word describes emotional state situation, merely geographical reference. community anymore. People look other. mask mandated people shooting wear it.....well, care, every man himself. keep family safe God bless. asshat backing Olympics. Could different story vaccinated multiple hospitalizations deaths. Yeah, didn‚Äôt make fuss said wasn‚Äôt going didn‚Äôt feel comfortable everyone vaccinated. point, don‚Äôt want go vacation someone mindset. It‚Äôs clear wouldn‚Äôt get along. didn‚Äôt get backup coworkers though, disappointing. read reasoning?

Although vaccines safe, risk children Covid low giving healthy child vaccine risky letting get Covid. Children pre-existing conditions make vulnerable vaccinated.

It's matter medical ethics.  starting second wave. lull last months defined end last, we're starting next one likely much larger first. ""Living giant island"" ""its island! (usually referring New Zealand""

As Canada USA *effectively* islands. ""the outsiders"" coming from??? Air travel, ""the islands"" stop people coming.

Like hell ANYONE maybe like 50 Americans crossing border illegally getting Canada, except air travel. We're island, almost every way. ""excuse"" ourselves, make seem ""so easy"" Australia New Zealand they're completely surrounded water. USA except 1 land border Canada one crosses illegally pretty much, 2 land borders USA, one one crosses illegally pretty much, pour billions billions billions dollars trying ""protect"" perhaps one heavily funded border protection spots world (even though, true, extremely pourous. issue worse Mexico USA. Mexico illegal border crossers brought COVID USA.

People dumb island talk. UK island. shit job handling COVID.

NZ/Aus good job, hardly benefit, ""they're islands"". someone grew weird limbo lower middle class America rarely ever got flu shot even old enough get recognize exponential spread? even faster previous variants. Without vaccines would much worse previous variants.  Slowing spread give 7 year old time turn get vaccine. &amp; others 12 suffered enough &amp; deserve get protection many Americans shun. July 1st. way, Florida! Sueing company would almost work out, company already cost benefit analysis determine people negatively impacted dangerous behavior would cost less court fees profit could make.

Safety regulations came events like Ford pinto exploding low speed accidents.

Financial regulations came events like Bernie Madoff pyramid schemes companies like Enron made financial data.

Contrary beliefs, government arbitrarily hand regulations funsies (usually), government hardly come agreement anything. fact regulations exist means shit went could gone would negatively impact potentially large amount constituents. become increasingly difficult pass regulations nowadays though government US become increasingly 'us vs them'. People yelling downvoting sub months taking position maybe - especially given reliance honor system - lifting indoor mask mandates questionable idea.

To hear people sub tell it, fool gloom monger.

Actually, no, J&amp;J vaccine available got it.

If listened sub tell it, would anything everything wanted mask possible repercussions. 

A 33% efficacy Delta may reward trouble. count two waves? Mind explain? don‚Äôt lock flu then? estimated reduction death 40x covid vaccine, puts range flu. point, you‚Äôre still concerned covid, wear mask yourself, especially N95. Don‚Äôt make others subsidize need feel comfortable. school staff. wearing mask, moment school requiring kids wear masks. really hope changes next month school starts. Thankfully office, plan stay office much possible. It‚Äôs infuriating. would tell deadline decide send vaccines people want them. India. interesting discussion legal ideas.

Let's hope vaccination rate slow down. long? July, FFS. Require Labor Day. think outcry remove accelerate people understand abetted early spread virus. Vaccinated people wearing mask endangering community. took steps needed protect community. I‚Äôm really curious folks got original virus back late 2020 / early 2021. cases infected Delta? Common not? I‚Äôm worried Pfizer vaccine fail I‚Äôm locked back keeping kids home virtual school. Speaking Megyn Kelly, hated movie Bombshell especially ending similar message: don‚Äôt care sexual assault harassment workplace don‚Äôt benefit it, fighting let advocate sexual assault harassment workplace.

I ashamed say screamed GTFO TV. fired pretty big threat. 90-year-old billionaire Murdoch need money either. even that. could done declared vaccine deniers public threats suspended drivers licenses put no-fly list can't spread around fast.

I feel like we‚Äôre days away interaction someone outside household declared super spreader again, really don‚Äôt want virtual learning, much prefer in-person. 

What y‚Äôall think do? Would really point? Delta variant upwards 80+% sequenced cases U.S. Quarantines pretty useless register 60,000 cases per day posted yesterday. thought asymptomatic cases didn‚Äôt spread infection? Love this. Thanks posting. sharing! live Earth, ever get it?! lack taste. lingering symptoms. exposed twice last week tested negative. Meanwhile, people exposed vaccinated covid, they‚Äôre even sick enough take day work (working home course). Vaccines work, guess well misinformation campaigns exist ensure people die. 

What world live in. deaths un-vaxxed/red areas though? think people quietly add quietly get shot. happening dream world least 70% people vaccinated (according recommendations herd immunity). gonna feel like good ol' 2019...  least canceling games ruled out. wonder people said canceling games impossible days ago. Fact 1: fully vaccinated people still get covid.
Fact 2: covid mutating rapidly.
Fact 3... covid give AF ""opinions"" - Andrew Wakefield first ""doctor"" peddle autism vaccine nonsense. time hear someone say many regulations, realize one place prevent company something could harm people.

Also remember regulations actually cause outcomes anything similar intent was! told 70% restrictions would fall away. I'm holding politicians word. can't promised, promise.  Opposition masks becoming pro-covid happened days announced people color getting hit hardest. Never forget that. I'm sure old may need go back school issue reading comprehension. Q- USA take home test, report results(+ -) public health reasons? curious results reported may effect things like school reopening.

It's year 2021. lot people super computer palm hands allows easily quickly access documented research vaccines. hear scores health experts subject click button. 

Unfortunately super computer also allows quick access things like ""Christians 4 Trump"" facebook groups TV FOX News. things making Fauci anti christ wants put microchips people control turn communist shit. Fox news watched cable channel country constantly reinforces stuff. 

This political now. Social media fox news ultimately GOP responsible spreading shit allowing spread nipping bud early. 

It's late many bought GOP cannot push people away need voting base. 

That's at. Vaccine hesitancy? Naah, DeSantis blame pushing policies counter vaccinations, masking safety measures. He's downplayed pandemic beginning. loser. care much people tell ? 

Can't look facts analyse ? type scenario tests belief ability survive species. really changed much last 250,000 years. technological ability far outstripped emotional maturity. unfortunate visit local ER 8 months back, unrelated Covid.

I masked, everyone helping working hospital masked. people beds hallways *everywhere.* bizarre see afraid regretted even going.

I asked nurse Covid said, ""This bad. work contracts city places really rough.""

When released looked local Covid numbers. hospital listed minus 2 ICU/Covid beds available.

That explained many people scattered place. quiet, much quiet time ever emergency visit. suppose be, people hardly breathe, unnerving.

Glad made without getting sick, became primary fear week after.

Florida. course. hate republican's disinformation lets honest, Oprah introduced modern anti vax mainstream. evil snake oil salesman entire career. greed lead many lies introduced culture. protection majority people around either already thus immunity people vaccine.

You're referring concept ""herd immunity"" reached yet.  oversimplification also assume experience representative general populations Minorities also likely work jobs retail restaurant industry gives exposure people, opposed WFH office job. since likely poor, they're likely live smaller, crowded housing. Article say large nursing home can't even guess efficacy.

And 95% effective general population, sub-populations like nursing home residents inherently less healthy. 

And 95% effective nursing home residents would probably require 99+% effective general popualtion.  [insert generic excuse freedom]! also limiting spread. 5 people 100 people (95% efficacy) vaxxed population gets it, slow spread. Unfortunately response many situation like double views. can't accept family member died nothing ignorance, choose instead believe they're targeted conspiracy causes [insert reason here]. Yup am, article US ? Good point. policy accountability actions. people die result misinformed accountable deaths way. Kids 2-13 get EUA fall, maybe that's thinking about. Israeli numbers based 143 people hospitalized put much value using 'percentages'.

143 way small sample size come conclusions patterns. could think many variables may swing results 10-20% either direction/group.

I'm following UK data seems thorough data sure. LA County July 7-13, 19% new COVID cases (1300 4122) fully vaccinated people. people keep voting politicians office believe living wage affordable healthcare all.  Mean city counsel meetings using term ‚Äúhouse n-word‚Äù public meeting. glad bigotry idiocy country exposed. One silver linings pandemic. Shows society need put work. Yep, makes sense. case, people loudly spreading vaccine misinformation would held responsible death every person decided vaccinated.

In words, held responsible arguably homicidal impact speech. children, relatives, etc. symptoms? anything lingering recovering? local hardware stores n95s back stock. interested. left soul discretion parents 

Does mean parents get decide souls? Prime example educated people Nebraska taken seriously won‚Äôt be. MYEP.   core group anti-vaxers, many people vaccine yet fence sitters get becomes urgent enough them.  sister one them. hard-core republican assumed virus going away soon bother take vaccine. also rural area works home, see urgency.  first time last week talked getting vaccine.  

So people convinced get it. Faculty fams get vaxxed not. Children‚Äôs families get vaxxed not. Kids fine. fucking stalemate never resolved without literally holding another human injecting them. gonna mask little ones rest school years til end time let things land fall? don‚Äôt get this.... wait long wants. guidelines recently loosened make official. Im northeast, know plenty hyper liberals want vaccine. couldn‚Äôt bring take care them, Nurses paid better especially assholes around ""In United States, COVID pandemic unvaccinated, according head U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention."" 


Let put bluntly... 


""In United States, COVID pandemic uneducated, gullible, willfully ignorant."" Yes  remember harassing rest us acting like jerks get back fully upright ‚ÄúWomp womp‚Äù position.  hope homie back media say things wanted hear. does. even bother trying save them. made minds.

Our society tends default freedom choice, good default opinion, also pragmatic working prevent freedom one person trampling freedom another. point people upset mandates usually ones blame necessary first place. People acting responsibly already convinced right course action, less likely oppose mandating it.

And even may wake up. Sad. really. basis science set tools allow break bias misconceptions discern reality using math. Trusting science therefore require raised trust it. could certainly people exist, requirement simply learning science would give tools break free bias see wrong right. I'm glad place nonchalant. third world countries like 1% vaccinations? People understand concept correlation equal causation. second Moderna dose made several friends sicker we‚Äôve years. It‚Äôs meme. 

That said, it‚Äôs way better getting Covid. fuck people afraid sick day choose sick two weeks? welcome know read charts, attempting mislead people. know intentionally since asked ""Bullshit"" posted i'll try summarize.

First 63,000 deaths involving Covid compared deaths involving pneumonia. there's column Covid shows read chart.

It states: 

Deaths involving Covid: 598,000

Deaths involving Pneumonia: 535,000

Death involving Pneumonia + Covid: 294,000

Deaths involving Covid, Pneumonia, Influenza: 847,000

The fact said 63,000 deaths involving Covid compared deaths involving pneumonia. there's column Covid pneumonia.

Shows can't read chart posting source.

The pneumonia deaths seperate, 535k people die pneumonia, stating 535k people died also pneumonia. 

It gives second figure ""COVID + PNEUMONIA"" deaths confirmed covid pneumonia. covid deaths will, included 535k figure ya dink.

Aka 535,000 - 294,000 = 241,000.

Which means according chart outlined(Don't worry we're getting back chart several times, there's way much unpack) 598,000 official COVID deaths 241,000 pneumonia deaths unattributed. means 340k people died covid pneumonia like claim.

Moving third term COVID OR(Not plus, OR) influenze pneumonia. combination, people 3.

However 240k figure also misleading. figure INDICATE DIED PNEUMONIA, indicates pneumonia died. says ""Deaths INVOLVING(Not caused) pneumonia"" yes matters. People comorbities.

This wrap around spreading misinformation. trying frame chart unintentionally (Or intentionally) misread spread ""100% undeniable fact"" hope others look much it.

However get's even tricky even that. assumes COVID death toll 598,000(Well higher per date CDC). simply case. Excess deaths account 600k, causes deaths increase(Traffic accidents leading death, overdose deaths increase, violence account 50-70k increase), still accounting... Another 300k people.(As per May 2021, official numbers 578k)

http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths

The suspected excess deaths 920k period March 2020 May 2021, factors death account 60-70k excess deaths(Traffic accidents, overdose increases etc), means states per May 1, 2021 860k deaths unaccounted for. Well technically 578k accounted COVID. leaves nearly 300k unaccounted for. 

....

You know going continue post think went far enough. could attack argument 10 angles, assumptions made absolute bunk narrative trying push try get across.

At end i'll leave one statement: Learn read article chart posting act confident data interpretation data lack thereof. pisses see anyone know posting RT shit. depends, bed ridden essentially. wasn‚Äôt exaggerated case 24 hours. 

The people probably saying covid flu whatever tough one day. 

You either get covid potentially feel bad one day. It‚Äôs hardly comparable, it‚Äôs laughable even worst reactions would scare people voluntarily choose covid.

I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt prioritized twitter cliques small numbers medical professionals disproportionately large voice - sides debate. Makes great clicks though, ""long covid kids"" new argument keeping us locked down! Exactly. 

If along COVID current levels think it‚Äôd viewed bad flu require dramatic measures. wait, thought anecdotal stories can‚Äôt draw conclusions breakthroughs - wouldn‚Äôt same? means, hope tactic works you, I'm happy look like we're here. I've dealt pandemic year half, deal another months. realize anecdotal Dr people thinking vaccine ‚Äúcure‚Äù use last ditch effort revealing right? kinda figured everyone knew vaccines worked maybe needs PSA well?

Also keep mind probably 95% regulations put place REACTION disaster occurred previously. truly pro-active, rather, enacted pro-active, reactive big issue went ""Oh shit, that's issue"". Conservatives want pretend regulations over-bearing ""we never issues things!!!""

Yeah, idiot, regulation...  describe flawed Australian quarantine system is, plenty articles NZ system highlight pretty alarming opportunities leaks. world Delta, matter when, if, COVID busts MIQ, confident current situation due luck.  Exactly dude. Like whole thing pisses off. see small town guy gets info Fox News talking rural buddies whatever store goes could think bullshit. BIG assumption places ever masked properly first place, LOL. It‚Äôs ok cynical. Hang !  That‚Äôs true. people going haven‚Äôt gotten don‚Äôt know anyone real life it‚Äôs abstract us know many who‚Äôve died got sick (and mild). see do. anti-vaxxers developed countries too? thought find third world countries like mine üòê that‚Äôs fucked honestly exactly plan, though? German politicians seem stopped caring.
Yes, many people possible need get vaccine. whatever ""final"" number is, happens then? enough people vaccinated, lockdowns again? What's endgame? live like forever? Covid death rate trivial 35s? Surely taking UK approach vaccinating risks groups first super important. vaccines incredibly effective preventing hospitalisations deaths. think underestimate living absolute ignorant cesspool Alabama average person's perspective. Also mother 9 year old, think need stop looking covid news awhile. Really freaking it‚Äôs helpless situation right read wrote? 

The Lambda variant concerning way spike proteins mutate make vaccines ineffective. Yeah, got J&amp;J trust real world data Beta, immune escape Delta, J&amp;J‚Äôs lab studies showed. Plus efficacy increase time. Like, problem getting booster, would get one tomorrow, I‚Äôd like see one non-peer-reviewed study. see new type specialist.

The first available appointment referral ER? 8/5/2022, that‚Äôs typo. Alabama Mississippi worst vaccination rates 50 states. It‚Äôs hovering around 30-35%.  It‚Äôs mix OP‚Äôs hope largely young vaccinated people getting sick context national lockdown. You‚Äôd rather ICU rescue fluid lungs slowly drowning them? 

You‚Äôre right though, feel hopeless either way :-/ really need stop reading things like son still ineligible vaccinated üò´ would look like acting role keeping ugliness people treating mind? would make us worse before? Wouldn‚Äôt be, worst, ‚Äújust bad‚Äù vaccine? shame too. PCP best ally health. took long time get someone say ""you try lose weight."" managed lose 30 lbs own, starving end day pure calorie restriction diet. told that. ""Oh, well, try appetite suppressant."" Five years later, I'm still 95 lbs heaviest weight.  Pretty sure gets bonus patients keeping weight off, too.

As soon got 2nd shot, scanned uploaded card, within 24 hours got confirmation medical record ""(thumsup"") tacked end. Yes do? Lmao common practice lot East Asia. may both, specifically remember egregious Kelly's spent whole show like 8mos pregnant  feel similar way people. Mostly sad, judgemental. biggest difference people dying COVID-19 even sadder stopping local pharmacy shot far easier quitting smoking losing 50 pounds. don‚Äôt buy 5G shit fact government trying microchip me. That‚Äôs reason I‚Äôm getting vaccine haha. comment proves ignorance, making assumptions known facts. I‚Äôm getting don‚Äôt think need get it, that‚Äôs okay. Based personal experience ignoring media spews, wouldn‚Äôt even know pandemic. What? replying said? I‚Äôm advocating tens thousands people die? I‚Äôm saying everyone unvaccinated knows they‚Äôve received misinformation believe true, even though know it‚Äôs not. They‚Äôre purposely choosing believe lies
I realize vast majority won‚Äôt change mind. find sad. Arkansas 40% healthcare workers UNvaccinated. 40%. I‚Äôm wondering states low vaccination rates also sizable chunk medical personnel unvaccinated. 

The 40% quote Dr. Romero, state health director. He‚Äôs pediatric infectious disease specialist. think pretty gross enter patient's room initial goal maintaining sympathy them. Even treating someone literally injured themself purpose, compassion sympathy come first, cause feel guilty seeing face-to-face. Welcome health care. exactly copping mechanism. Please get therapist. need mental health. part job.  Okay, helps. Definitely need /s see people say similar things sarcastically all. Thank mentioning this. It‚Äôs important. 

To point, using ‚Äúhospitalized‚Äù baseline ‚Äúsevere‚Äù covid indeed somewhat misnomer. 

Mild moderate covid absolutely miserable debilitating. sent home ER supplemental oxygen sick you‚Äôre essentially confined bed rest week picnic. 

Several family members endured ‚Äúnon-serious‚Äù covid still ended ER once. isn‚Äôt uncommon. 

Methinks perhaps it‚Äôs bit denialism disinformation covid minimizers/deniers, antimaskers, antivaxxers, antilockdown folks, etc. It‚Äôs essentially script 15+ months ago ‚Ä¶ kinda amazing little it‚Äôs changed, tbh. agree. It‚Äôs odd vaccines receiving skeptical treatment. different way masks rolled handled messaging-wise. Probably best choice photo though say. Lol delayed getting something checked several years... later turned cancer. able handled, sorta, left lasting-to-permanent side effects.

That's ""it's late"", completely fault (and employers kindly laid cancelling number checkups handle last minute 'emergencies'). Despite really fault, sympathy &amp; compassion showed varying medical professionals time day leaves awe, let alone hard work fixing situation despite insurance interference.

I cannot fathom like doctors, let alone specific professionals. we've already shown think call ""essential workers"" bad enough, still time leaves dumbstruck.  know possible even schadenfreude holy shit gasping air begging oxygen music ears. secondhand anecdotal evidence least *one* doctor telling people tan well need use sunscreen, so... yeah, tracks. doctors really be. going even soon unvaccinated adults white they're going dying droves Delta. hypocrisy bit rich. see people job boasting vaccine status incredibly obese (worse thanks lockdowns last year) many others drugs (especially cocaine - since hell normal thing now!?), binge drink smoke (also seems increased since last year).

You might fine time, come next pandemic, might live long enough vaccine current weight/lifestyle. would say that, office California, half people legit obese, another quarter overweight. It‚Äôs stunning see much food people eat - gigantic burritos, huge bottles coke- 3,4 pizza slices single sitting. It‚Äôs morbid‚Ä¶ Well aside factually wrong, US gov. reporting approx. 42000 die every year preventable deaths (115 people per day), means yesterdays new case count 3.8 times deadly preventable deaths day. still seem like asshole empathy, factually incorrect asshole regard actual stats.

Also, people scared, worried. Worried loved ones could die, worried might employment tomorrow, worried get sick go hospital, could encumbered debt even lingering side effects carry months. Disregarding legitimate issues really make monster.  Glad others taking precautions. I'm really talking work, I'm thinking restaurants/bars, concerts, cultural places, etc etc. Work bit different situation, even either vaccinated, wear mask subjected regular testing. Goodness. I'm living California bubble, know bad states. agree vaccine works well everyone, real reason one people even accounted early! vaccine marketing blitz aimed black communities try build trust vaccine, common knowledge black folks less trust medical industry \*real\* reasons.

I also agree specific example linked happen time. *does* happen time black folks treated well white folks healthcare found ‚Äúracial ethnic minorities receive lower-quality health care white people‚Äîeven insurance status, income, age, severity conditions comparable.‚Äù ‚Äúlower-quality health care,‚Äù NAM meant concrete, inferior care physicians give black patients. NAM reported minority persons less likely white persons given appropriate cardiac care, receive kidney dialysis transplants, receive best treatments stroke, cancer, AIDS. concluded describing ‚Äúuncomfortable reality‚Äù: ‚Äúsome people United States likely die cancer, heart disease, diabetes simply race ethnicity, lack access health care.‚Äù ""

Study study confirms this, present day. Known acted upon epidemiologists who've working covid since beginning.

This incredibly important **build** trust vaccine communities historically presently mistreated medical industry large.

(and white ppl mistrust vaccine bc trump, mccarthy, facebook different black ppl mistrust bc communities personally burned before) I‚Äôm sorry mate recently gave pursuit medicine healthcare workers treated pandemic. worth me. one question always ask is, make appointment primary care doctor ask opinion whether receive vaccine? far, nobody answered yes question.‚Äù

This fascinating me. I‚Äôm 30‚Äôs haven‚Äôt primary care Dr since child. I‚Äôve always used health clinics minor issues thankfully, never seriously ill. 

This also means never adult life routine care. screenings, blood work physicals - can‚Äôt access healthcare. Insurance expensive make little much get subsidies.

I wonder much countries distrust science due fact many us can‚Äôt access medical professionals left trying cobble together diy healthcare information non medical sources. does, though. Compare maternal infant mortality rate black white people, see pretty damn quickly there‚Äôs still racism medical community affecting black people today. US seems uniquely burdened political weaponization ignorance.  escape us? want bad   takes special breed human deal everyday maintain high sensitivity empathy case. Medical staff truly remarkable.  Yes, probably roll take it. imagine live without hope. exactly ""effective rates"" distribution age/health. headlines helpful anyone since complicated percentage. 

I mean honestly mean JJ come contact covid 33% chance getting number breakthrough antibodies much lower. even mean. agree you. know many people without primary care doctor, factors many cases I‚Äôm sure. job loss pandemic insurance tied jobs etc. know that‚Äôs 100% I‚Äôd say portion anyway. 
It‚Äôs sad preventable. Alabama folks trying setup lord flies scenario Yoooo escape? give tips? want fuck Getting covid shots took total two hours whole life; walking healthy distance take long every day.

This person old ‚Äúif you‚Äôre totally innocent, can‚Äôt judge anyone making clearly bad decisions‚Äù. dumb, bad argument.

I cocktail before; still recognize unhealthy unsafe flirt cocaine heroin addiction. false public places unsafe vaccinated people. [The mRNA vaccines holding well example, article cites study showing one dose Moderna 72% effective symptomatic illness delta, protection even better hospitalization/death."
