0,2020-12-14," don’t think thing long term research regarding vaccines they’re available public. phase three, that’s it. quite honestly, vaccine takes 5-10 years develop stop pandemic would almost useless. better worse, 2020 1950. ICU beds taken crisis actors! coworker showed video youtube told me! Wake sheeple!

/s Fresh? ""After all""...?

Didn't know along? Never go full simple jack. Apply loan? Nope.

Does inspire confidence. Physician, heal thyself. want stop living fear potentially fatal/debilitating virus Careful, sound like one antifa thugs I’ve read need least 75% population vaccinated. effective, yeah get noc, rest country needs too... year now? still stuck inside wearing masks? I’m really giving hope. rushed. mRNA vaccines development last 20 years, waiting opportunity like deployed, 5th Coronavirus encountered history. Stop baseless claims. want feel energy venue. Live music miss anything. leaders do. man good ,professional leader.  Dolly Parton get together camera sings. would watched vaccination ever. Yea, believe that. Not. high risk? not, could always continue mask wearing social distancing let someone else place line. would probably continue precautions longer people will. decide creates bigger risk yourself. reasons said, really think it'll happen, least homes. Add top points fact lights eventually go bad (yes, even LEDs) maintenance cost (""my AC/heater works fine without it! I'm fixing it!"") plus expensive system install means unless building code mandates 99.9% people say no.

I mean let's honest, really good filter help lot things general people still buy bargain bin filters almost stick pinky through. way people voluntarily.  Agreed. None contradicts point. OP saying long term health effects disease vs. vaccine completely known quantifiable, suggesting ignoramus disagree would like approach vaccine caution. V wants spend health care. SD wants spend less, think Sweden less brown people, everything work fine end. want play live music again, touring industry hit HARD. don’t smoke dope, either! I'll bet put as, ""Do want wear mask?"" either. sure follow you, think it’s clear don’t follow me, let’s leave here. necessarily determined yet Large groups people generally driven emotion. makes people feel better like skin game could say. It’s whole mentality “you first”. Idk man. live pretty conservative area even people thought fairly rational expressed doubt said taking it. crazy. honestly say closer 50/50 either us would care admit. Atleast area, minority saying absolutely get vaccine soon available. actual polarizing topic be. Plus getting enough volunteers phase one trials normally takes 3ish years. Getting enough phase 2 takes 1-3 years. Trials vaccine cut applications within days exceeded max # volunteers could handle week. literally skipped years ""hurry wait"" vaccine addition amount work faster. knows side effects better us? shit. 🤣 doctors tested week, idea staff tested. That’s apples oranges comparison. Flu deaths estimated, covid deaths based testing death certificates. Huge difference. See post info CDC arrives estimate. applied flu model covid, deaths would 2-4 times high. 300k? K. It’s good thing couldn’t care less ✌️ Good Lord pathetic drive load cars car carrier, deliver second home, fly in. considering millions infections CDC says actual numbers 4x - 8x higher confirmed cases... saying majority country likely long term health consequences this?? Seems unlikely, yes happens rarely, happening large scale we'd hearing millions people suffering health consequences non-stop news. we're so... Exactly. one death many shouldn’t aggressive shutdowns sheep haven’t found comment yet Oh look, actual leadership....I'd almost forgotten looked like. network means hospital network, patients insurance network. means beds hospitals network 13 people wait list care. Feel like either complete bullshit doesn’t trust vaccine either. hate mixing true anti-vaxx people people skeptical. I’m vaccinations, parents vaccinated I’ll vaccinate kids. one? I’ll wait years taking it. already covid well probably pretty far list eligible people  Exactly. astonishing people take single glance actual science produced, instead focus fucking CEO company. Like gives shit takes not... Eh still get it. convincing one person get vaccinated 30,000 people getting vaccinated show safety? clinical trials statistics reason.   *free* 2-day shipping sometimes one day sometimes 10 days. Conspiracy idiots would claim real vaccine ITT: speculation article says rather people reading it. Hello disgruntled Leafs fan :( anti vaxxers made pandemic worse? vaccine beginning anti about. Get vaccine protect you. That’s do. Don’t catch slippin’ absolutely line I’d getting mine week. I’m groups ahead line, I’m not. Sureeeeee CEO also decided announce news company's vaccine, so... interested hearing facts 

X doubt Yes, I’m pumped kick back chill. know kids say- COVID chill. 

Honestly, feel continuously tense, feels inevitable lose someone COVID-19. It’s feeling watching scary movie protagonist peering around corners dark house. know something bad gonna happen, suffering unknown terrible. 

So yeah, thank god relax now, dread, sorrow, despair really getting me! Damn! That's wack. Norway pretty strict quick quarantine close contacts last 3 days think. schools daycares partially fully closed one staff children found positive. don’t know know this, covid vaccine Definitely going retract one. 

Given credentials, would hope detail evidence claims. offers unsubstantiated claims conspiracy weak circumstantial evidence (some critiqued debunked claims made others). problems, combined organisation writing for, offer fertile grounds skepticism. awesome want volunteer! might start Red Cross. directly involved, likely could point right place always ton volunteers. mom used work retired. call local Red Cross. Even without herd immunity spread slow considerably start approaching number. deaths decrease vulnerable people get it, hospital capacity increases. start taking steps towards normal, completely normal, well herd immunity. Mina, Harvard epidemiologist, lack regular testing health care workers raises questions.

""There's clear problem we're saying greatest-risk people, people greatest risk patients health care workers,"" Mina said. ""And that's we're going give vaccines anyone else. vaccine, testing, say, 'Don't worry it, big deal, need tested.' ""

This makes wonder testing like countries. batting average GPA This, make year can. Everyone I've talked regretted semester, fly by. [Scouts Guide Zombie think people get much higher rates. available CVS everyone it, they'll too. fun easy contrarian right idea. Tuberculosis kills million annually don’t cry Imagine average fatality 28 year old instead 80 year old. I’m pretty sure guy already got vaccine privately something. Never trust profit motive guys tell Flu deaths estimated. Covid deaths based testing death certificates. flu deaths counted like Covid deaths, would 2-3 thousand year. doesn’t CDC base seasonal flu mortality estimates death certificates specifically list influenza?
Seasonal influenza may lead death causes, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. recognized many years influenza underreported death certificates patients aren’t always tested seasonal influenza infection, particularly elderly greatest risk seasonal influenza complications death. deaths – particularly among elderly – associated secondary complications influenza (including bacterial pneumonias). Influenza virus infection may identified many instances influenza virus detectable short period time and/or many people don’t seek medical care first days acute illness. reasons, statistical modeling strategies used estimate seasonal flu-related deaths many decades. counting deaths influenza included death certificate would gross underestimation seasonal influenza’s true impact. Toddlers famous meltdowns tiny things

yes, finished dealing one son decided that, washing hands, suddenly completely unacceptable hands wet, wet hands prevented using towel right next him...\*sigh* ""not really plus side"", virus control US helps speed Stage 3 trials candidates.  Exactly, I'm teacher remote since March district. teachers keep getting angry district said whether remote next semester keep asking announce it. said vaccinate teachers get numbers lower community could safe return halfway semester - like late March/early April. made feel like crazy even suggesting that. thank summing thinking things going play people getting immunity vaccine (and also getting immunity record levels positive COVID cases) 70% 'recovered' patients(well deemed clean bill health diagnosis) still suffer persistent side effects.

Source? agree. Nice, got gel manicures (dries UV lamp). feel better melanoma risk! US record covid hospitalizations 109k. spewing misinformation. Sure, isolated flu outbreaks overwhelm hospitals. never 109k rising type
Numbers flu. That. Is. Fact. Brilliant deduction, genius. Almost self-preservation exist.  Agreed! teacher know several teachers gotten COVID-19 certain got school place go. Yet health authorities always say ""no get school"". frustrating. interested hear facts this, turns you’re better. **Dec. 15, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Moon says gov't focus protecting 'vulnerable' people amid virus groups call mobilization private hospitals COVID-19 gov'ts shift higher gear block spread special forces personnel mobilized support virus interesting question look terms comparisons COVID Flu deaths. 

I grabbed data ""COVID-19 Deaths Age Group"" CDC 

Of course, deaths represent less year. 318 days since first COVID-19 deaths early Feburary, let's say numbers represent 87% year. 

The high-water mark flu-deaths year recently 2017-2018, [with multiply 87% year COVID data for, takes us 53k. 

So, reduce COVID-19 deaths ""acceptable"" flu-like levels, we're looking cutting factor 4.9x. Or, put another way, we'd reduce COVID-19 deaths 80%. 

Of course, pretty meaningless numbers COVID-19 deaths *with significant behavior modifications* place. hypothosize much deadly COVID-19 season we'd we'd behaving like normal year. models predicted many 15x cases, corresponding deaths, behavior modification.

If accurate, we'd looking close 4-million COVID-19 deaths year far, need reduce COVID-19 deaths factor 74x, 98.7% get ""flu-like"" territory zero behavior modifications.

I expect reality gradual relaxation measures time, increase ability prevent treat COVID-19 increases. Yes! often defend Tegnell reddit people making shit up. real isssue him/FHM he/they forseen catastrophe nursing homes. improved sick leave example little paid hour Swedish nursing homes. FHM get that? boggles mind. people stubborn. don’t change opinion one day next. always argument “the CEO didn’t even trust enough get begin with”. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nazi Zombies? Like, prioritize Jewish People? would go Jewish Zombies? man can’t win subject. However, science science, regardless confidence product. lean favor applauding cutting line.  like it, make right. Yes right thing Right there’s articles doesn’t make statistically relevant. Lmao not. Like instance true cynic already got said didnt fuck would know makes company look good therefor increasing profits line. What? it’s pretty obvious. Kinda sketchy. That’s nice way saying doesn’t wanna test first batch sees side effects haha mean, that’s normal you, okay. don’t think mask-wearing considered normal. can’t see others faces it’s reminder something wrong. wear mask right I’ll wear others protected definite end. Otherwise goalposts keep moving. CEOs much companoes day day. know anything all? That’s dumb part, fact found way delay asking Okay, know similar questions asked even made front page. safe vaccine kids?

First off, I'm vaccines. answer hospital asking wanted give newborn hep b vaccine - less week ago? Yup, give whatever needs.

But that's questions come covid vaccine. understanding, vaccine quick production line bc things like funding prioritized starting point previous vaccine work/research.

If mother - I'd subjecting vaccine. However, mother toddler breastfed newborn, I'd like info. 

How safe know vaccines young kids breastfeeding mothers? understand newborn gets antibodies one many reasons breastfeed. potential (if any) negative long-term effects new vaccine? long take effects show? Obviously there's data yet covid vaccine, what's outcome vaccines?

I ask bc would hate subject kids hasty decision regarding new vaccine. right now, I'm leaning ""when get chance get vaccine, we're it"" side. But, me, one things that... Well, kids young choose themselves, parents make best choice them?

So back question, safe vaccine little ones? They're afraid COVID, they're massively over-worked 9 months straight. make even worse stress, they're working fucking asses year whilst half population sits home watching Netflix living free money government. easy thing all, think even work people dying vs. others. *Someone* die point, unavoidable, recommendations based feel cut least amount harm, unfortunately still die, people simply die since society whole completely failed slowing spread. point people running arguments, hope you’re supporting man pilot programs/studies canine detection since start thing. nothing substantial ever seems come it. Saying want cut line line!  Man SMELL boomer coming comment. Management typically least efficient part company, manegement company less efficient. CEO like figurehead company &amp; really make big decisions, appease shareholders &amp; act figurehead. delegate actual managing lower level managers, never themselves. companies could function weeks, maybe months CEO dissapeared. 

But that's probably complicated tiny, smooth, brainwashed lead poisoned boomer brain. there's mechanism happen conducting ongoing studies study that? every drug market? done every vaccine past? 

I understand pandemic, science science. There's due process reason, course things expedited adoption high risk individuals bit quicker since improve outcomes...but mass adoption risk (especially zero evidence vaccine stops infecting others), makes absolutely sense. status. People aren’t antivax still scared vaccine fast made, fact virus politicized, big pharma companies sometimes considered corrupt. politicians getting vaccine inspire confidence, shouldn’t CEO company made vaccine same? Hey agree masks work. I'm stumped cases region dropping well. Bruh. take it. Anti-Vaxers find reason take it.   ""not markedly"" like 300K hot take like deaths reported? HEPA air purifiers help, lot.  HEPA air purifier basically HEPA filter blower fan, arranged move room air filter times per hour. chance virus gets room, good chance get caught filter anyone inhales it. 

If family member gets sick, put him/her single room, put HEPA air purifier near patients head.  air patient exhales, likely go filter anyone else breathe it. (This addition masks social distancing, lots extra cleaning, course.) Sorry feel way. country isn’t perfect enjoy it. Hope find right place you. think would good Pfizer's CEO get vaccine filmed in. want thank Dr. Katalin Kariko tireless decades work mRNA makes vaccines possible. put much line hold fast research knew would work. people praise mega corps, Dr. Kariko remembered. Wha? - Abbi would PR shit show cut line. simplest answer usually right one. good questions, not? Unfortunately far many. selfless man 🐑🐑 saw story NFL commissioner said won’t “jump line” vaccine. news? hell thought would? think players first group playing now?? Read room buddy. modern medicine would slowed it. I’m even anti-vax/conservative, still don’t trust new vaccine yet. it’s CEO got shot...Then, well, maybe that’ll different. I’m kinda done trusting news/media/our government/etc. this, nothing seems ‘true’ anymore. So, yeah...You first, buddy.  know noticed earlier video he's wearing bandana type scarf thing whereas later video he's wearing paper mask. 

Here's likely happened. boarded without mask wearing bandana thing promptly removed got seat. asked comply didn't. next scarves bandanas much airline offered paper mask begrudgingly put (incorrectly). 

too little late United mew would comply soon reach cruising altitude point would expensive turn around. 

the worst thing they're using child pawn make video go viral. stupid understand evidence non-compliance right video. board paper mask mask his. unfilmed portion struggle United even get wear paper mask. family March. cat ate people food got sick May. Vet checked out, gave meds said would fine. bounced back got really sick, vet surprised. ended ICU organs failing. vet said crazy, suddenly multiple cats thing. died. think Covid-19. Oh yeah, could forget 🤦🏽‍♂️ wonder many get vaccinated one crate  don’t think opinion common, definitely take vaccine April May general public take it, ie people thread vaccine skeptics choice. demographic health condition qualify take earlier, urge read FDA report many good summaries /r/COVID19 thougts exactly. sell guaranteed service fail follow through. flu shot. vaccine highly politicized lot misinformation surrounding it. 

Whether right wrong, many people think instilling public confidence better waiting line. 

I also agree corporate speak PT line. Whether reason true not, screams corporate PR created message, makes people uncomfortable. It’s bit weird back January February drastically overestimating virility lethality virus everyone began call us e r saying people needed actually stay home couple months. mean, wrong. Covid neither deadly kills often thought. always said 500k-1 million dead Americans end year worst case scenario. supposed extremely pessimistic prediction it’s far reality.

The thing didn’t understand thought everyone would try avoid virus. assumption killed x number people would stay home. stay home. never stay home. thought people would avoid plague.

It’s really fascinating I’ve studied human psychology behavior 20 years. lot assumptions going need rewritten now. didn’t know would happen. retrospect it’s thing happened 1918 people didn’t write much happened year. John Barry says doesn’t know didn’t write much all. There’s lot things nobody knows, real question always nobody knows, compared events.

Obviously, see it, really mad other. seems answer.

&lt;reposted sub auto deleted usage e got kid today... 58 given first time. 

Also plan vaccine pass heard
 want get plane? Vaccine pass please.

You want enter grocery store? Vaccine pass please 

You want kid school? Vaccine pass. Oh dont obstructing kid going school? CPS takes kid. ""I want this. want that."" comments thread fucking entitled. Stop acting like bunch spoiled brats. Boo-fucking-hoo movie theatre long. freshman year college online. Cry dead river near-sighted twats. 

 
Consider parents and/or grandparents sacrifices looked like. ***Fucking war.*** Drafted. Leaving country gun hand go get shot at. 

GOD. fucking pussies! Stay fuck home. Wear fucking mask. part. Stop acting like pandemic ruined life fucking ninnies. Ah we're screwed. hope Dumba bounces back. Kaprizov looks like real deal, too, well Kahkonen. make vaccine stinky inside?  Rebekah Jones * Yes can! studied vaccine! also check make sure create super zombies 500 years makes shit rainbows visit specific coordinate.

I know see ""see check it"" check things plausible. mechanism vaccine cause issues 8 years never happened vaccine ever. either use vaccine thousands die per day every day fear something never happened happen (the zombies 500 years) end shitty Covid lifestyle get safe vaccine. hero make sense, common long term effects? really know they're temporary? new virus all, done reading common long covid thing is. see news reports give anxiety. wrong, that's I'm saying. can't say someone incorrect happened yet. Stay cautious. metric? Total cases? California largest state one first hit. Looking daily cases per 100k people last week we're something like #15. Total cases per 100k we're something like #35. state government legislature pass orders real laws teeth? well, twice child. mom let play kid them, already bad figured couldn’t catch them. did. Yup, though conversation passing equipped time answer question time. wife's doctor went OB, usual doctor idk found them. 

I even asked doctor yet, plan do. wife pregnant focus lol think people missing point ;) 

Happy cake day btw! read wrong like...Paul Reubens, you? read NY Times Korea start getting covid vaccine March. delay? post /r/frugalmalefashion play card game, yeah dude definitely latte artist. callllll b/s pledge allergenic

For liberty justice all. missed point, time sensitive. yook first would delay 1 health worker getting it. Fuck even dullards Reddit defending him. weed hookers since January? da clerb everybody fam Since requiring consent become dumb? comment arrogant smug. put ‘news savvy’ insinuated motive challenging you. Yikes right, tone self righteousness. yet suffer result downvotes suggest Americans arent privy distrust black community. I'm going get vaccinated, I'm confused black Americans hesitant. American? think trying show CEOs wealthy general get go front line. He's one dose, I'm sure there's lot well-connected CEOs might able skip line. would probably look good public would kind assurance people able get money status. received $2B order vaccine even developed. Yes payment pending delivery business $2B what's essentially ""backlog"" incredibly easy justify lot extra cost fill order. know promised funds ready soon product ready. That's huge incentive fast turnaround huge relief balance sheet. Why? People stay inside cold. He’s also rich enough live without encountering hoi polloi several lifetimes let’s act like he’s hero. dont know thing subreddit. point w post? Impressive growing Jamaica, coming US going community college college become nurse work position responsibility. 

I’m impressed achievements. Also, wears multiple masks throughout video. boarded nothing put bandana thing finally point agreed wear paper mask offered airline. evidence deliberate noncompliance. then, then, use child pawn make stupid video. 

Too little late. knew he'd take soon reached cruising altitude, point would expensive turn plane around. best take. I’ll bar you! arent selling consumers selling countries government 

## Abstract

There growing evidence thrombotic inflammatory pathways contribute severity COVID-19. Common medications aspirin, mitigate pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. assessment designed quantify correlation aspirin mortality COVID-19 positive patients care. Data Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database utilized evaluation. Veterans across country first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result included evaluation comprised 28,350 patients March 2, 2020 September 13, 2020 14-day mortality cohort 26,346 patients March 2, 2020 August 28, 2020 30-day mortality cohort. Patients matched via propensity scores odds mortality compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription associated statistically clinically significant decrease overall mortality 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting odds mortality half. Findings demonstrated pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription strongly associated decreased mortality rates Veterans diagnosed COVID-19. Prospective evaluation required completely assess correlation implications patient care. Following logic I’m sure anybody’s even worrying pandemic all, since mainly affects elderly gonna die soon anyways. /s Oh hero. That's thing gets dicy, America least. Canada covered side effects, fear US, money one. first thought reading headline tru damned do, damned scenario. Either fueling nut jobs getting passing people cutting line...  cases start exploding November temperature dropped? people can't bring US article matter you?  Hey, everyone chill out. Regardless conspiracy theories, common-sense, lack thereof, question supply demand.

People shouting take instill faith, taking best option doesn’t need compared others. People saying it’s one person who’d missing vaccine.

But people missing big picture here. He’s young, doesn’t need work go outside, CEO home, easy. hire people fetch groceries. alone, ability almost completely avoid virus, doesn’t need vaccine right now. He’s also 60 yo, 1% fatality rate compared someone 80 yo, 15% fatality rate. numbers based people symptomatic enough get tests. statistic 80 yo accurate, statistic 60 yo higher true statistic, 60 yo less likely worse enough symptoms feel like COVID need tested.

So, saying, supply demand. Day-to-day, don’t experience issue much. want standard vaccine, you’ll never get turned away doctor. buying lot bread prevent single person also getting bread, supply large enough meet demand. case here. CEO taking vaccine right guarantees someone getting vaccine right now. Someone older works higher-risk environment, therefore higher need vaccine.

Him taking vaccine right could quite literally cause least one person die preventable death “next person line” would one behind be. statistically probable, idk. Could actually save lives taking vaccine now, skeptics could see faith vaccine, knows? point is, purely ethical standpoint, taking vaccine right preventing someone else needs vaccine getting vaccinated right now.

If you’re 40, 0.2% chance dying COVID, again, stats based people sick enough get tested. real percentage lower. you’re older 80, 15% chance dying COVID. means 80 year olds need vaccine 75 times anyone 40 needs them. yeah, saying younger people (Younger 60) low-risk get vaccine right selfish. Even it’s “Just one person”, vaccinating one person 80 yo older equivalent vaccinating 75 people age 40 terms raw number lives saved (discounting effects herd immunity, etc.). It’s simply efficient use limited resource.

People talking it’s one person mindset many Americans people around world made pandemic bad is, also made world dog eat dog needed be. kind other, care other. We’re shithole together, might well assholes work towards common goals, y’know? also believe aside mask mandates, eventually ppl heed public health advice doctors begging know hospitals full can’t get care whatever might need. guys sound like think crazy conspiracy going virus spreading like LOL. Masks work. That’s it. real possibility getting healthcare hospitals overrun. cannot speak going elsewhere, Iowa, decline cases directly correlated governor instituting mask mandate. don’t need ppl saying oh well wasn’t masks something else give ppl reason ass holes wear them. Masks work. million people take show longer term effects new technology Pfizer Trial also notice ratio advanced stages?

For example, 2 infections among vaccinated, every 40 infections among placebo? sorry. one likes pedant doubles pedantry pointed him. Skepticism good thing have. specifically trained knowledgeable medical field... could even pass school Plenty. VA hospitals, Pentagon, CDC, Smithsonian. Treasury, WH, Congress. Library Congress... could stop human contact, theoretically yes. can't, hospitals assisted living etc etc keep running, intra family contact unavoidable, idea short strict lockdown fantasy. Lockdowns work, get 0 cases, 3-4 months. I'm saying happen *at all* I'd like understand Trump can't use Emergency Powers Act order Pfizer produce however many vaccines wants disregard Pfizer's business arrangements countries US fill. want to, legal/technical reason Act can't used case?

(Once again, saying moral thing do, Trump moral compass anyway curious see option used...) He’s saying record know damn well high profile quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes Russell Wilson getting shot! ""excess deaths"" stats good for. would impossible track every single death indirectly caused covid. get high level estimate excess deaths stats. K. what? madness, still say distance wear masks there's still 0.2% chance shit catching it? bitches inbred they're sandwiches kind response expect? Well that's good. encouraging. reports bad reactions Pfizer vaccine still stands. Delete wifes co-worker tested positive covid-19 today (she asymptomatic, got tested husband showing symptoms). work wear masks use sanitizer frequently. try keep 6 feet distance that's always possible. work giving paid time I'm contract worker wouldnt either. process buying house filing unemployment question. feel like really tough spot continue work support family... going get tested tomorrow work. I'm scheduled work Wednesday. daughter small daycare. know question is, maybe... ideas do? I'm thinking n95 masks us work able young daughter. clear, none us tested positive. fuel anti vax culture. Lol thanks reminding I've seen awe science. 

Legit question: government’s big business track record deceit? There’s lot money stake. developed science, don’t think it’s unreasonable fear something funded corrupt government housed greedy businesses. I’m talking micro chips Illuminati. I’m talking corner cutting rug sweeping. 

No intentions annoy start fight. Genuine inquiry fearful optimist. webpage, large majority ICU beds taken Covid-19 patients. looks like Covid propaganda, trying make reader think lack ICU beds due Covid patients stating facts contemporaneously, fact 303 888 ICU beds use Covid patients state.

This ""Covid pripoganda"". lack ICU beds directly due COVID. That's 1/3 ICU capacity. Hospital ICUs usually operate 80-85% capacity normal times. additional strain due COVID patients stretching system limit. reason people think kids less susceptible virus schools don’t help spread virus—manipulation data, lack testing, plenty asymptomatic cases. part said jobs privileges? people praying everyone get vaccinated? Meh. worried taking actions aftet 900 cases, US nobody still cares 3000 deaths day I'm sure even dumb dumb like see difference Check edit. Different vaccine. There's media coverage there's nothing cover. don’t want it, fuck them. Let live (or not) consequences. expect stop wearing mask gets vaccinated. need wear immune disease. Lol comments. fucked. Suuuuure Five years says. choked drink.

You fun that, then!

You people meaning people sub. hard ons shit swear. ya conspiracy mumbo jumbo Edit: mistake neurological issue, different vaccine

So yeah conspiracy mumbo jumbo. delete comment maybe basic googling posting stupid shit future. mean, country two official languages, one historically oppressed, large indigenous population historically currently oppressed, like quarter foreign-born homogenous. population matter here.

The point state/provincial government national/federal government fundamentally different things. national government monetary policy, whole different scale fiscal policy, potential IMF international partnerships (financial trade), military quickly deployed, legal authority nationalize critical industry, country whole needs raise taxes recover obligation citizens much harder time moving feet different jurisdiction.

State/provincial/local governments would good administering stimulus since on-the-ground knowledge active personnel ready put work. **They wholly inadequate tool funding stimulus, that's national government exists for.** sucks person duty fails job, blaming lower levels inadequacy able pull productive. understand feel. understand science complicated difficult understand.

But whether prevents transmission irrelevant right now. healthcare provider personal health public health. getting? I've read long-term affects vaccines determined within first 2 months afterwards - since would first mRNA vaccine used humans, 2 month rule still apply?  spend time convincing anti-science antivaxxers?

Cool, cool. Look did, chubby jerk. Same. Yeah 30,000 person trial totally never happened. point skepticism, willful ignorance conspiracy nonsense. call bullshit. misleading, CEOs cannot sell stock whenever want to, coordinated 3rd party insure insider trading. Pfizer stock increased vaccine announcement reached previously set goal triggered sale. exactly. theory, hospitalizations deaths reduced dramatically long herd immunity everyone keeps talking really. They're rapidly shrinking. September, 50% Americans wanted get vaccine. went 58% Pfizer announced efficacy Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. week ago, pulled 61%. Like, day later, Gallup polled 63%. Today, collaborative study PBS, MPR, Morist College polled 68% wanted vaccine. Nazis Ice prequel to:

Springtime Hitler. Guess reserved seat bunker meteorite planet? Yeah... Um... you... no, insist. Or...he already gotten telling. anti-vaxxer would say received placebo. There's positive outcome taking early. Everyone's cruel utilitarians comes people passionate moralists comes themselves. Bet hot fucking dying lived nursing home. it’s horribly written. Oh hey! seemed like intellectual! Enlighten think, please. I'd like hear intelligent things say.  Fucking moron. necessarily. Sometimes 96 year old healthier 70 year old multiple medical co-morbidities history non compliant medical care. Age number. Meanwhile Trump White House:
""GIMME-""
""NO, GIMME-""
""BUT I'M DAD'S FAVORITE-""
""NO AM""
""BUT I'M LAWER"" *DONT KNOW* whether vaccine prevents transmission. Nurses required get flu shot know flu shot prevents transmission. agree that. know whether one affects public health personal health. know more, start require vaccine nurses Man that's really sad hear, I'm really sorry (and their) loss. think it’s two part effort. Pay people salary enforcement tied it. violate orders, lose two weeks financial assistance. essential workers, pay 50% salary call hazard pay. violate orders aspects lose bonus two weeks.

I’m sure people say shouldn’t pay people ethical thing, America. Money talks people themselves. Pay people save lives, debate people right thing let people die.

Also, I’m arguing you’re saying. I’m ranting anything. Probably happens country thumb imperial power centuries stripped bare walls.... people people fuck people Apparently new news thread. would make much sense. wait - 360 new cases today, far day. can’t couple weeks behind full ICUs seen elsewhere state... people need stay fuck home. Wow, woman!?? Usually WWII veterans men. awesome. ""Lincoln"" won’t be. governments know take money waste blowing middle eastern countries building million dollar bike railings, siphoning buddies, telling they’re going take pay mess they’ve made. like, top head? 6/20 something nurses within 6 hours getting vaccine came one trials researchers confirmed one possible side effects. honestly hope fluke get information id rather get covid Bells Palsy. Ah, well. bad. virus spreading like kind of... virus family name Professorburg. Oh community. read sticky/faq sub vaccine. answers questions few

Eh. There's always hopeless cases. mind ask that's southern northern California? He's already won. He's gonna reap lots money this. cynical marketing thing drum public favor. 42% U.S. adults saying would get vaccine 50% September, still indicative significant challenges ahead public health government officials achieving mass public compliance vaccine recommendations.

Gallup polling reputable. Trump getting vaccine anybody White House AFAIK atleast right now, may changed since last time checked. don’t like I’m immediately tied conspiracy theories point elephant room. semi agree subject fact people think it’s weird shouldn’t surprise anybody. Either side affects not..
I hoping force people get it.  Gonna wear mask knows long, issue doing.. truth I've probably saved colds wearing everywhere. seriously bring polio Yeah I’ve already vaccinated Priorities: prayers school totally need them.
A vaccine: wish What? That’s still relevant regarding article.

If actual read article, point masks don’t work. It’s masks make minimal difference setting that’s already socially distant area low infection rates. also extremely limited study, limitations attached said results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings home tests, blinding, assessment whether masks could decrease disease transmission mask wearers others.

The study also done dates April 3rd June 2nd. Transmission time 100-200 cases day April... less 50 day May. entire country Denmark. population almost 6 million people, already culturally distant Americans.

Of course spread low- less people infected virus means less chance spreading it. That’s people trying post study don’t get (and probably helps didn’t read it.)

The proof numbers today. implementing mask mandates, less infection occurred. see [Kansas, counties mandate versus data relevant situation, outdated study country different environment own. LA drier. Humidity actually matters. Wtf? illegal? Insider trading hesitant Pfeizer vaccine myself. side effects sure Bell's palsy...ehhh. Luckily mere food processing worker healthcare workers seniors getting time see happens think risk younger people giving older people killing them... say high risk infection either able take precautions... 9 months still free clear. I've said another thread: continuing restrictions could become something two -edged sword could potentially end discouraging people getting vaccinated. bother getting two shots sit house? vaccine dangled way get back normal (at least US). Keeping things could potentially turn probably greatest scientific achievement 21st century colossal failure. think anyone wants that. Sus also touted ""things never back normal, go back way things were"". sum credibility. Give liberty give death Public health experts doctors saying pregnant women get vaccine. did, upthread. scroll need repeat you. yup, dose would one hospital worker would protected. turn many  Nope haven’t heard single person getting again. I’ve graduated kids IC still go normal. I'm you, old fogies vaccinated life go on. still hug aged parents am, things looking good go back normal life.

And people saying ""What immunocompromised"", dozens vaccines still tested made exactly people. Aka Swaziland recognize name. one CEO company producing vaccine answer yes.

No, really prove anything. Conspiracy nutters would claim gave placebo, one else gives legitimately want take vaccine.

Right. knows safe- entire future tied performance CEO- he's willingly releasing unsafe vaccine ... exactly?

30k people gotten vaccine already. based research that's going 10 years. Presidents getting vaccine. Pfizer even create vaccine, CEO certainly anything development- matter? source one local doctor. way doctor identified H H genome announced tests. must able sniff COVID patients. really hope force take it, probably lie it, still seem likely death toll depressingly probably going worse spring.

Sweden's COVID-19 ICU cases 50% spring plateauing/dropping. maybe likely, knew bad statement soon said it.

The intention put kids minds ease, probably put mall Santas huge risk stupid people. live NYC wear mask. wear mask, usually wear mask throughout given 30 minute period. guy goes unmasked, home brewed setup cheap (even paper mask standards) paper mask, airlines probably ordered bulk give out. Oh well... it'll take longer anti-vax people, get immunity naturally rest us take stab Queen United Kingdom getting vaccine? know conspiracy theorists would say fake vaccine boost stock prices General population: 23 per 100,000 people 0.023% Vaccine: 4 per 20,000 people 0.020%

23 per 100,000 per year (according link) vs. 4 per 20,000 per significantly shorter time year. increase. age distribution might different comparison good anyway. test control group needs similar many parameters like age randomization. control group relevant.

Is 4 20,000 relevant you? depends covid risk factors like age comorbidities. seems low enough benefits probably vastly outweight risk people, perhaps all. single risk. Long term risks harder evaluate. Worst*

Too much. Skipped. 

Damn bro. goes whole blm movement then

You're funny mad news. bare minimum. I'm anti-vaxxer. got flu shot last week. Flu shots nothing new people make them. long history documented safety. Including lifetime experience dozens vaccinations seasonal flu. mention vaccinations vast array unwanted cooties. But, brand new stuff. good tens thousands people went trials testing, results look quite promising efficacy safety. But, still new. pardon folks I'm viewing Pfizer vaccine touch trepidation CEO Pfizer holding taking themselves. went remote June last, would usually go office twice month person meetings/parties/whatever. used hassle me. we’ve fully remote since March really miss meetings! next couple months definitely going fraught vaccine squabbling. get live. Already see bs conspiracy theorist IG's coming this. read heard virus travels lungs, travel rest body blood stream. may organs extremities affected. Brain issues, amputations, diabetes, heart attacks, list goes on.  


""Clots, Strokes Rashes. COVID-19 Disease Blood Vessels?  Probably, i'm expert. vaccine made market. already given tens thousands. guy key... opposed Americans using Sweden left right wing prop whenever suits them? Lol back 2015 right wing spouting going move Swedenistan go ""OMG see businesses stay open, let's like them!"" Wow. Someone woke rude side bed morning

Wow- lazy bothered read 8 whole lines text? honest- level laziness downright impressive :)

I guess much trouble ask understand something simple fast-tracking talking heads local station told scared thing know anything about. want anyone think wallow see not. lives matter grand scheme things. lives really important you?

Setting aside fact provided evidence PS5 deaths- YES hundreds thousands lives important PS5 lives. I'm truly astounded seriously trying compare waiting get PS5 waiting get Idk even trying argue. I'm rushing take vaccine. going waste time?

Why bothering respond?  lemme guess, take first first one accuse abusing position first line.

There way please everyone. envy respect. WE'VE ASSUMED CONTROL Damned do, damned don't. make sense. takes flu shot least two weeks provide protection flu. Pfizer vaccine gives unknown protection one shot anyway, takes two shots 3 (or 4 idr) weeks apart get 95% protection know about. states big trouble today actually derive benefit least month, that's bunch people vaccine simultaneously *right second.*

These states citizens need following restrictions *today* hospital situation burn ground time vaccine could give meaningful effect.    Oklahoma. People seem care. makes sad live state. Can't wait move soon enough expect even dedicated COVID zealots crack time March. Choosing one form propaganda another, telling truth? Rule 34 Well admire BiLs determination drink alcohol smoke. totally reconsider vaccine poison.
 
It's modified virus Yes far opt-outers limiting factor. trust isn’t built whim. It’s built time.

I mean, yeah, see relationship two back back sentences wrote?

It many months there's enough vaccine supply skeptical people impact rate, trust built time, words: people months seeing millions people get vaccine fine build trust.

In June next year 150 million people already gotten vaccine, ""the pfizer CEO get last November"" going big needle mover seem think is. Really sure people conversations get vaccine early solely boost confidence supply unlikely meet demand several months, time loads famous people going end getting they're elderly, loads people going get _in general_ time. that, stimulus demands ""employees can't sue workplace get COVID there"" law put in, fairest option possible would using compromise:

Employees can't sue workplaces COVID, workplaces declared workers essential required pay COVID vaccinations workers, WELL businesses required give every employee least 5 days paid vacation year event side effects vaccine causing unable work day vaccine's completion (since there's claims second dose knock day side effects.) claimed essential miss work, put money mouth is. idea americans obsessed flu shots.

In Europe widespread.

Out 65 years, 44% vaccinated.
And vulnerable group, stats much lower younger Gotta love mods put new thread every day 12 PST, west coast best coast baby  Please don’t breed wonder much fact people ben sedentary, eating less healthily, making less healthy choices would pandemic contributed extra deaths? personally, I've much sedentary, sleeping poorly, eating less, drinking alcohol, making unhealthy habits previous years. Shut stupid. Stick Trump forums keep bullshit sub. Future history books wild citations 2000s believable Amazon lobbying increasing minimum wage ""moral"" reasons.  Shit, CEO taking it, fuck look like trying take it???


I'll wait Moderna one. mean typically big pharma aren’t exactly known moral compass altruism EU. Donnot forget EU. I'd argue important time convince general public comes much nearer actually get it. go Santa plastic snow globe external air supply. may take another one, Pfizer vaccine looking shadier day. want hug mother wants hug baby. Wouldn’t researchers taking make sense. Pfizer financed it. didn’t develop vaccine. Florida CDC, neither trusted kind numbers days. Hey man lost arm Bear attack. 

YES... still 1 arm, trying spread baseless fear??? people fucking stupid smh... Seems kind like bragging many trees burning forest fire consumed them. There's already reports shutting London right new mutation believe “Anti Vax Russian conspiracy weaken US citizens health” conspiracy looking for. Especially US. allowed say drone targeting now? No, get into. Yes hard succeed getting degree pass licensing exam. Nurses drop like flies practical testing (demonstrating perform certain tasks) normal failing grades. Nursing school extremely difficult, clinicals work hospital school, physically emotionally grueling. licensing exam tough, know practicing LPN failed RN licensing exam. already nurse still pass it.

-11 year RN wasn’t arguing vaccine. saying argument stronger front honest known side effects, comment. person responded said side effects first comment responded to. **100 Punkte** für dich, du lagst richtig!😄 Oh, really really REALLY need things. seen news read comments absolutely must live lives? Nothing sacrificed, ever. Freedumb! Hahahahahahahaha

You scared. Trust me. suppose right, taken placebo lied job improve company profits. Freshman well I’m probs going back spring quarter campus experience here’s hoping it’s least hybrid :) already got PR knows really morality US? permanent solution known long. least currently, thus mask still needed worn. know people vaccine still spread it. least I've read.  flu vaccine people blink eye get one omg world ending get covid vaccine.. people mange wear mask properly avoid large crowds cause spread rapidly. They're ones need vaccine sure. hit reason many people say IQ currently used utter bullshit.  
The original inventor wanted way find people needed help education, could learn point caught up. 
And Nazis Racists got hold it. everyone careless places like US. Again, said, good try anyway. Far anti-vaxxer I'm RN covid ward, move along others happening lately many healthcare profession(at least hospital personally know outside it) bit hesitant.

Don't see not. lives matter grand scheme things. lives really important you? 

Idk even trying argue. I'm rushing take vaccine. going waste time? cares gets 2 million doses already manufactured? replies complete joke. big conspiracy, he‘d lie received shot. really simple. think combination covid killing people virus leaves system living less healthy lifestyle--being sedentary, eating poorly, drinking more, sleeping poorly, etc.  Translation: I'm going want, care hurts kills. 

You get extra points honest selfish vile. 

Legally, free that, morally level drunk driver taking road. God hope so! CEO, would know.

If don't, managing people. vaccines undesirables .. top 1% wouldn’t dare let inject would be, would prevent taking vaccine? little suspect.

If took would endorsing safety vaccine nobody would see jumping line.

Secondly there's clearly need protect maker's vaccines keep production running he's also key worker respect.

He really reason take fact taken raise questions answers... dies week later totally unrelated causes. would something! sucks. ain't gonna take apparently. chose get pregnant I’ve 5 miscarriages getting old wait longer try.

That's downvote buttons for

[Actually based responses certainly expect someone ignorant know Ya fair fair. Let ED pills first worey vaccine. 

Do troll amusement someone pay I'd trust local station fox cnn

I'm going skip part local station almost certainly owned one major media conglomerates.

I do, however, like skipped part pointed fast-tracking vaccine way unsafe- simply prioritizing reviews based relative importance. local station saying vaccine candidates fast tracked prove rushed way, shape, form- simply proves FDA stupid seem I'm sure people stabbed killed ps5 now. mean ya really like that.

You're obviously trolling point alternative think purely theoretical deaths ""just like"" hundreds thousands deaths doubt even stupid. love vague comments say stupid one ""sides"" upvote. Easiest way farm karma talking scale millions.

*He* would make absolutely 0 impact said ""Fuck this. I'm taking vaccine, going covered media""

The benefit would absolutely massive.

That's truly standing behind product.

Too many people taking ""waiting turn"" ""SEE CEO TAKE VACCIINE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" EMA slow. like everything else EU Stalking comments butthurt loser? want person force friend drop college?

Are ok 🤣 literal CEO company supplies vaccine, waiting ""in line"" ignorant fool Um? Mind explaining think go need fix issues asap. need distraction, need action Hello, Pfizer, get you? would feel tad bit comfortable took vaccine, please cut line. LMFAO knew production rushed, makes think need hold least months see long term effects. 

As recall, CEO's problem cutting line get covid tests bottleneck, getting exclusive stem cell treatments get sick. Ахахахаха а ведь американцы настолько дебилы, что они ему поверят ""Do believe world's actions year necessitates Olympics

What trying say here? Olympics climate change longer issue? 

😂😂🤣🤣🤣 matter they'd getting tens hundreds millions people even really trying, operate reason, convinced Facebook meme posted Russian bot account true tough? AFAIK Pfizer production plant Belgium. harder ship rest EU Pfizer US shipping US year, like, 2020? 2021?

s/ Ozzy's going infect Coronavirus kill off.  That's bit different middle raging pandemic though. Military conflicts would probably well boost babies born. stated fact white house pressure. denied reality. Really, eating dog food often stomach it. It’s lose lose him. takes it, skipped process, doesn’t take it, doesn’t trust it. I’d take say I’m waiting turn shoes. bet staff took earlier versions, trust work point. Thanks, fortunately large support system. exciting scary. I'm doctor, everyone hospital going take vaccine CEO said kind enough allow people need first. Oh goD deFInITE PRoOF WhoLE VACcINe SCam, PFIzeR InJEctiNg MicrOChipS. sTaY wOKe simp think politicians aren’t cutting. I’d much rather Fauci “cut” people tbh. don’t think it’ll forever? mean obviously he’s causing doubt? it’s whole reason you’re arguing case right actually are. least according Georgia vaccine distribution website. weren’t getting didn’t want guinea pigs. NorCal long takes directly dependent many people keep stupid assholes dont wear masks, keep social gatherings, think vaccines conspiracy bill gates control humanity. 

This could months, could take another year folks idiots. ""The vaccine stop transmission"".

That implies they've tested whether vaccine stops transmission. understand it, none vaccine trials tested that. wondered seen data know about. Hypothetical emissions really comparable actual emissions. kids reduce carbon footprint. I'm nurse myself, everyone hospital going take vaccine CEO kind enough allow people need first. 

Source: Trust bro. read Satan Likely. People weird things circumvent laws. example, suddenly students renting busses throwing high way parties. EU able use lot resources compared Canada UK

The EMA staff around 750. UK's regulatory body MHRA 1200. 

On top EU regulator moved UK EU 25% staff didnt want relocate much EMA staff new.

They seem little disorganised honest. That's good term, D-Day. V-E day. unit 731  I'm betting something like PACs Irresistible (2020). ""You're separate entity can't talk anymore, working building 10 feet PAC section"" honest discourse idiots. know answer. want shriek mistakes Democrat governors GOP governors like DeSantis hide COVID data send gestapo scientists family. hits wrong. wouldn’t top White House officials want get vaccinated? Wouldn’t go long way towards instilling trust people, mention protect power around them? know higher risk population needs go first watching someone promote product would never use little discerning. guess really depends whether actually ends taking it. Yes, Better angry people (that cut line two doses tens millions?) want people trust it. Second option causes harm first one. Well, folks like getting tens-to-hundreds millions others many vulnerable groups. Additionally, already administered 44,000 people trials Exactly. cause harm scepticism. would've taken it, yeah, maybe people would mad/annoyed/angry, cares, made people fear it, would've made people want it. Better angry people want people trust it, tell people on. two doses tens millions, really? Yeah, let get list every nurse said particular hospital. I’ll make sure include phone numbers call individually make sure it’s true. I’ll right back. really comment ”deadliest month” part. absolute numbers. Per 100k November 2020 top ten lowest november ever regarding mortality. 

I think plateu Stockholm partly correct since spread high steady. time, worsens, real ICU triage start (it probably already smaller scale). far disaster mode capital. never got disaster mode spring regions Sweden. ....he's CEO Pfizer mean, literally name (Sino), mention country make political. told someone connections NIH March phase 1 vaxxed. June phase 2. category mention would phase 4 (I also fall category) takes 3 months phases I’m guessing like December people like us... Yeah goal convince 100% them.  Sorry, sounds like Potemkin vaccine. 

They approved months ago, without proper data disclosure. marketing around world countries, barely began vaccinate population. I’m going send mates.....
Tin foil overload coming ...1

2.....
Lol Read WSJ article Pfizer rushed vaccine through. Chilling stuff.
The CEO vet got Pfizer job 2019. Jesus.  Officially, yes, quite government officials who’ve died pneumonia lot reports patients covid-like symptoms... would problem would doses. 10, 100, 1000 doses, people react like that. tens millions doses assume making more, two doses really reason complain cut line? Cuz knows it’s gonna kill people types vaccine _possibly_ shed virus injection live vaccines. incredibly rare cases, - live flu vaccines (the nasal spray type) pretty widely used.

However, NONE major vaccines far live vaccines means even probability. That's would thought he's CEO pfizer he's dealing corporate side things Hang friend. think joy you’ll feel over. well. trained vet. LoL. easily angered..you don’t come across level headed 33 year old. caused bitter &amp; angry towards strangers online? I'm favor, I'm stating fact.

Not sure confused Better parking garage Hahahahaha make sleep night. You’re pathetic. asked much longer think we’ll dealing restrictions... trust/ed vaccine almost entirely. Didn’t think getting vaccinated soon allowed to. 

This kinda sus. conspiracional way, „The CEO company producing vaccine doesnt trust enough take himself“. dont care secretly takes wants say appear altruistic - good sight.  isnt dependant political position, whose charge, thing controls many people getting sick covid. people wear masks, less folks spend time around people, people get vaccine, faster get back normal. 

Look places east asia, new zeland cant even tell pandemic going controlled behavior early stopped spread. Americans dumb shit “muh freedoms” “trump aint wearin amask aint either” element basic safety politicized folks quickly wrapped identity around contrarian show loyalty ideology without understanding two true sides fight, human side, virus side. 
Do everything power help thing kill people. Odds half fucking million innocent Americans dead time shit slows vast fucking majority could gave avoided people werent selfish ideologically possesed assholes. assholes sleep soundly rain drop feels responsible flood. Bold claims like pointless can't show evidence. might well claim one getting it. I'm sure exactly taking long. mean Canada, UK, Singapore, US etc. authorized Biontech vaccine doubt they're cutting corners dangerous way. Meanwhile EU able use lot resources compared Canada UK, thanks many member states (and tax payers), needs much longer work? Why? many months prepare process. vaccine ? can't give anybody covid vaccination, neither mRNA vaccines adenovirus vector vaccines actually cause body produce full covid virus, there's nothing pass on.

The trials measured often vaccinated person develops minor asymptomatic infection exposed covid19 community whether able transmit infection despite vaccinated. Note mean know vaccine nothing prevent transmission, measured effective preventing transmission yet, uncertainty, although reasonably likely least somewhat effective cutting transmission. right! hate religions equally. Muslims, Christians, Jews, religions suck equally bad. talking job? that.

We going get fired taking it, talking results actions whether counter productive goal helping people. someone going take vaccine despite multiple countries approving anf top doctors saying they'll take think taking would made much difference anyway. would easily dismiss lying something One vaccine going change game. Let's real really surprising EU slow approve vaccine. 4 months later USA UK order it, getting delivery year regardless approval not. Convalescent plasma, special plasma someone recovered antibodies covid-19 Half nurses mother’s hospital saying won’t taking vaccine. Genius move CEO PR team. mean also job get what's point? 

We talking job is, talking better choice overall. Exactly. hospitals become full, haven’t driven anywhere I’m bad car accident, take me? gives pause. Lately, I’ve groceries delivered. I’m lucky work home. Except walks around neighborhood, haven’t gone anywhere two weeks. much appreciate attempt, antivaxxers going take wayyyy differently. Idk better right word certainly effective. suppression information refusal investigations virus certainly world favors. don’t really understand viruses spread then. two three people removed trial groups still vulnerable. aside, he’s CEO huge company. He’s meeting people time...it’s CEOs do. matter say always spin it

e.g. takes it... really take it? given shot saline solution instead trust it?

he take - maybe got anyways, nobody know sure

he take - must unsafe, trust product

The reality several common-sense steps could taken compress process much month without sacrificing aspect safety. medical community take it. they're incompetent. reason told us make masks actually *increases* risks. original guy think we're agreeing I'm fully sure. comments definitely insinuating pregnant women receive vaccine. agree practical theoretical reason facts available data decision. fully intend receive vaccine. get LatinX offensive. I’m wondering offensive Latino/Latina ? gender pronoun assumed Latino primarily one used? exactly?

Oh, breaching covid regulations. 
Alright then, thats reasonable deserved.

I thought first got jailed simply riding Jetski far, damn title implies, doesnt make sense. I'm sure rich politicians got last week 50 million people die year like every fucking year. People die get cowards . UK used EU emergency procedure, reason EU using Facepalm hard. can’t believe they’re vaccine isn’t even available yet. around corner full immunization. Shut schools! hotbeds transmission. play game? Fingers crossed cut genes pool. I'm convinced rich people bad crowd poor people also mentally disabled, can't believe someone would make comment turn around say know critically think. Canada getting lot first batches too.  many people said wouldn’t. got vaccine would make lot people feel comfortable. taking kinda eye raising. sound like idea talking about. kids normal default state world hence make carbon footprint lower normal person. time explain economics you. Like reddit understand it. orders books extremely easy justify spending lot money front fill said orders. interesting see societal reaction hospitalizations, serious cases deaths, still positive cases.

In sub still filled doomsday posters positive cases. knows something dont...is like CEO's fast food places dont let kids eat make? fine taking vaccine like anything new going wait months get second wave... Idk guess person say new phone releases I'm guy rush buy wait months wait user reviews let em work bugs kinks. thing vaccine. is. seems inline people's attempts defend institutions matter cost. medical profession fucks regularly, yet people continue trust without considering fuck-ups, like fact longevity declining. society designed way people experts particular job help people busy things expert job, also helping people. like team effort. good team effort. happens one segment economy good job, like MDs. start thinking ourselves. zero reason company willingly lose revenue pandemic ends. increase unemployment unnecessarily. drive prices, furthering income gap.

So yes, pursuit profit, also RIGHT course action end capacity restrictions (beyond normal), ends. God good fucking guy government said Tuesday total 54,505 workers tested positive virus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests Sunday, additional 98,289 tested positive using serology tests. PCR tests diagnose current new infections serology tests indicate past infection. mentally disabled? ICU full Stockholm patients moved/admitted ICU another region. Unless source saying happened please share. Billions people going die covid. sort disagree. imagine noticeable decline deaths nursing homes long term care facilities next month half / two months. far hardest hit places that's top every vaccination list. super high risk folks immunized, see number deaths falling. Yes, hospitalizations still (but increased capacity hospital vaccinations complete). Case numbers touched while, see becoming less deadly. Also sv40 non hodgkin's lymphoma.

The cdc published documents website ""contaminated"" vaccine causing non hodgkin's lymphoma. shortly took (it archived though). mother almost died it. know populace basically shareholders country, right? supposed people's interests mind well? Many greatest scientists human history Christian you’re full shit. many deaths US projected moving end flu season? Right 300,000 even year. looking potentially half million people dead? Nobody knew healthcare complicated much fun worried. Can't help noticing thread **completely different attitude** L.A. thread it.

Why? claim nursing home patients driving 38% deaths. seem ignore model active cases expected go 25%. nearly 1,000,000.

Combine with:
- hospitals already capacity
- get sick don’t need go hospital you’re sick two weeks
- get sick go hospital typically month more

It’s easy see hospitals overloaded turn away lots patients.

If hospital turns away critical patient likely die.

Given that, shouldn’t hard extrapolate death rate may relatively untouched. means think Europeans want people die?

And one country Europe that's USA, although UK leading vaccinations, UK always closer attached USA many ways.  Amen. That's true.... Sad true said.

The EU = full approval.

The US = rushed emergency approval, ton nice clauses rolled (no liability anything companies).

Is good enough? statement skepticism verification. That’s things approached.

She didn’t murder anyone vaccine started given out. sure she’s responsible people taking vaccine wasn’t available. 

But know also helps keep people alive? people wore masks everywhere whenever went out. I'm fine attacking hospital lack PPE well. jump down, run, breath heavily, without adequate PPE. care are, droplets spread, we've nearly year figure out. Really!? you’re idiot, nice know one camera recorded going could get ton trouble. Australia

Yes, country bill rights either. problem mandatory school vaccination isn’t approved children 16. 

There many schoos people 16, plus people work schools. Last page, got math yourself:

1-(14/38)

CBS News putting confidence interval anything it, raw data number. hope Scott 1000, would punishment  horse, ass, pigs. probably , might gotten already anyways, doubt they'd risk PR shit show still gets COVID - real possibility even vaccine mind you. Pfizer stocks moving week is.  vaccine developed using mRNA vector. fact product using mRNA approved. Moderna working mRNA 10 years yet develop product now. can't compare adeno viruses around 60+ years one never used before. can't figure angle. One one hand jumping post post, saying everyone vaccinated immediately everything shut people vaccinated.

But also posting conspiracies claiming covid hoax  admitted induced risk.

I never claimed differently Learn ------- read.

Im arguing isnt case outrage fest trying paint ------.  unwilling get vaccine are. Iraq vet. want prepare one give shit years. that's ok. judgement nothing love. That’s way little way late. invoked DPA phase 3 trials started, prepare manufacture hundreds millions doses per month immediately upon approval. energy, regardless profession is, journal it. Make record future like right now, mere mortal anecdotal observations. 

Write it’s impacting everyone home. Everything. leave future generations you’re gone. It’s family lore important shouldn’t lost. Awwww....
Look guys, capitalism fixed goong rockstars millionaires now... Well I'm Europe no, like see people needlessly dying purposes paperwork, no. term ""Trust science"" mean? not....wear scarves winter.....lmaooooooooooooo what? Wear fuckin mask way around? saw songbird, looking forward covid23 Lol you’re woefully touch world works....  CEO developer scientist. extremely similar near identical efficacy long haul.

The reason I'm excited big drop asymptomatic Moderna there's likely drop Pfizer vaccine well (they collecting data means try get public faster). basis make claim?

On fact kids need return school virus type fought via vaccine. 

It may true can't make vaccine kids I'm wrong.  oh no, Nickelback😳I hate sm😅 never said funny merely making commenting depressing. every hospital I’ve last 4 months mostly empty mean could provide arguments claim, any, could attack credibility (a typical choice actual arguments). gig workers got approved pua unemployment kind agree. almost turned meme.. ""trust SCIENCE!""  Ha, I’m using geo tag, like 604. Tengell? whole FMH? yea ain't agreeing curfew, sure close non essentials, free country able roam freely ever want. initial limiting factor always *always* beds. *Always.* 

Nah, actually staff. regulations based ------- logic, details facts case common ------- sense. ""i told disputing broke rules induced risk

The rules based preventing risk. admitted induced risk. Case closed boys, we're done ------- funds spent sea rescue

Boy going surprised learn taxes work someday.

This hard. Coronavirus restrictions place Pandemic killing people. Attempting sneak around restrictions dangerous still infected even take tests try careful. Taking recreational watercraft miles ocean designed also dangerous could potentially require coast guard waste time effort rescuing stupid ass could obeyed law like normal person.

Idk excited defend people breaking law, also shoplift whenever feel like ""because rules losers?""  idiots clue corruption pharma. vaccine rushed. long term issues side effects. market stuff solution take money something happens cannot sue hold liable. possibility body rejecting it. People already suffering paralysis face. guys think shit perfect? support wearing masks I’m lucky 2 year old comply, comment points hypocrisy there. travel family emergency, state “if child young wear mask don’t fly”

What fly family emergency? everything black white everyone makes jeebus wanna go back public school :c Really? freelancer approved MA. Also housemate books nanny got approved. real...

“The CEO one major firms producing vaccines end pandemic essential.”

Giving second thought setbacks entire world would experience died Pfizer replace him. Continuity leadership important keeping things running smoothly, losing leader firm producing vaccine right rolls would awful turn events. 

Too bad Reddit bunch teenagers don’t understand real world works.... enough ""medical professional performs dance"" videos one lifetime. Literally one going give shit guy runs company made vaccine takes 2 hundreds millions doses. Shit, care entire company first line, work company makes get first seems fair. trust doctors infinitely trust you

Oh, clutching **pearls**!! distressing!! lol fucking muppet compared fucked you’d one caught COVID severe case? point convince conspiracy theorists way there. point convince people fence I've also seen GBS several times viral illness could prevented vaccine. double edge sword. 




For question is, much data going happy with. me, would 5-10 year follow vaccine safety data. going happen pandemic, question is, going get vaccine all? so, might well immediately difference month inconsequential vaccine data/information. feel risk life long exercise intolerance possible sequelae COVID outweighs risks vaccine. sustain high risk exposures COVID every single shift.

There exists data presently demonstrates COVID-19 vaccine operates within persons younger age 16.
 
On basis make claim? goes show **even people medical field subject irrational beliefs** lack critical thinking skills. later years, Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling became total medical crank obsessed vitamin C-that could prevent common cold even extend life. never gave belief-insisting late 1990 would add 25-35 years people's lifespan would 'free diseases.' 

It well-proven vitamin C neither prevents colds, shortens them, 60 years since started obsession 'boosts immune system' (whatever *that* means, rabbit hole idiocy) become common belief things spurred supplement industry trillions dollars last 50 years.

Likewise, Kary Mullis-inventor PCR test 1983 1993 Nobel prize winner also AIDS climate change denier, believes astrology, big LSD user back hippie days-and claimed encounter extraterrestrial raccoon cabin woods 1985. know studies vaccines extremely safe. save lot lives rushing vaccines humming hawing minuscule chance could adverse reaction so, feed flames anti vaxxers. concerned safety point say “look vaccines aren’t safe, they’re delaying.” Thank service. I’m sorry you’ve forced situation. clear, MS currently 110 open ICU beds, 88% used. want people think literally ICU beds, title would suggest. mean it’s natural concerned something produced fast. reality don’t know whether vaccine cause long-term side effects year more. it’s anti-science anti-vaxx, it’s valid concern. agree, understand people skeptic getting vaccine immediately follow conspiracy theories ""them"" trying control population microchips whatever die little inside. don’t think permanently banned. It’s shitty situation fault. made get refunded them. Wonder would better Pfizer *sigh*

I found articles still problem, tested vaccine relatively young healthy people never negative reaction vaccine nobody general public varying health received second dose yet. lowered second dose healthy individuals became less likely go ER, breaking teeth shaking hard, etc.? Great, still change much concern given concerned individuals healthy. 

I could pull articles topic feeling citations go unheeded I'm going waste time pulling citations someone dismiss bias. trust doctors infinitely trust you, especially given even aware factor. Oxford 2 shots, isn’t it? That’s got delayed - accidentally 1shot half dose 2nd shot full dose showed better numbers also wasn’t intentional shittiest year man fuck year sucked bad I'll frosty baked potato. ....under normal circumstances.

they stopped sending **ambulances** 2 weeks ago.

if dying stay home.

&amp;#x200B;

San Bernardino County **no longer sending ambulances every 911 call** virus hospitalizations change aims ""help reduce strain"" county's health care system 911 calls hospital visits increase amid flu season pandemic.** San Bernardino County saw increase 75 hospitalized COVID-19 patients Wednesday, raising total 856. Of those, 177 are in intensive care units –– six Tuesday.

""It happens daily basis,"" Sherwin said. ""We show emergency room available bed ER ICU patients transferred ICU overflowed. means sit patient ambulance paramedics care patient bed available. five minutes six hours. Yeah too, even make sometimes even celebrated new years really hard thinking gonna great lol Iran shot commercial airplane accident? miss seeing faces, mask symbol reminder situation forces us impersonal. Covid plummets mine going time capsule. complete nonsense. story even remotely true, COVID didn’t kill him, shitty hospital policies did. hospitals triaging procedures place ration care intelligent manner. hospital turned away young patient could potentially make full recovery order keep 90 year old COVID patient ICU that’s terrible hospital management borderline malpractice. sounding lot like anti-vaxxers.

I'm even criticizing you, pointing lot people saying anti-vax using exact arguments anti-vaxxers. They're loony conspiracy nuts. made claims hearing trials without seeing data yourself? Got it. Wow that’s gonna surreal experience. Like WallE fatties hop spaceship earth first time hundreds years  Well Santa definitely delivered everyone year! Oh trust me, annoying. I'm teacher many vocal teachers district like ""no return school there's vaccine."" there's vaccine new tune ""but know safe? teachers guinea pigs.""

I can't fucking stand ""it's 1%"" garbage spews peoples mouth dont half brain look foot front face, like 300,000 people dead nothing worry about. absolutely right, central government trash. Yet Newsom also approved gyms remaining open, people gather rooms get sweaty breath heavily around eachother. He's seen unmasked indoor dinners larger gatherings people.

Crap, gave sads. no, two science based data preceding carried fallible human beings. Thinking facts anything *current understanding something* people going keep calling cultist. 

Facts gonna responsibility humble act like youre part kind winning team unless one compiling analyzing data Fellow tarantula reptile owner here.
Starting dubia colony blessing. I've working home since March wife works ophthalmology office work CAREFUL seeing patients need critical eye care, one employees huge Thanksgiving whole office freaking out.
Stay safe friend, say hi critters me! everything always limited supply. making seem like abandoning testing aren't. yeah governor lee sucks many reasons, article mentioned net impact total number tests per day minimal. 

if health departments completely shut testing would impact 16%, assume 2 days per week remaining standard impact always subtract 6% that. literally zero tests happened MWF would impact 10% testing. that's absolute maximum impact, minus however many tests available. 

in week TN 400k tests, means maximum impact decision 40,000 divided 90 health departments get 440 lost tests per week per health department. divide 3 days get 150 lost tests per county per week talking about, MINUS however many figure give out. 8 hours per day times 3 days long health departments give six home test per hour impact all. ten minutes per test would double advertised speed standard tests per ""customer""

governor lee sucks much kemp, desantis others, decision bad many he's made year. extremely odd me, assumed meant would become regional/community thing, like city outbreak boom lockdown Whats hard getting vaccine. I’ve already covid won’t crying get vaccine. wish could one covid many years ago that? Well that’s good news change repeatedly get exposed virus? it’s constantly creating antibodies customers keep giving me, would blueprint antibodies stay date more?  2 options. 

- Collect evidence sue unsafe workplace. 

- General negative publicity social media anonymously. Good quote bro damn  How? would confirm doubts reasonable. conspi-nuts would call saline, ""skeptics"" would say ""n=1 prove anything"" ""trust"" debate would get headlines.

IMHO missed ""No comment"" option.

Realistically, whole ""I gonna wait see vaccine works out"" argument bullshit, since people gonna get yet anyway. people getting *now* *at serious risk suffer badly COVID*, whole different risk:benefit calculation. development fast, argument itself. Critical safety tests skipped. manufacturers lot line, fuck may end killing white guys' grandmas... messing like bad business. That's *the CEO's trust angle*.

We need public theater loud minority agitated narcissists vocal opposition. anything need address truth: Making decisions uncertainty uncomfortable. Lucky us, us make decision *now* soon. comfortably wait see many thousands, maybe millions frontline old people pioneered decision us.

So really what's debate? think need reflect unjust entitlement people's sacrifices attention, also address undertone ignorant envy vulnerable prioritized, denies us ""freedom"" choice (see risk:benefit...) moment. normal old people wait long, parent comment thread suggesting car crash victims receive timely treatment, untrue. event challenge danger bats — whole purpose essay Sunday, NY Times, use event opportunity engage many people deeper understanding appreciation magnificence bats crucial roles play ecosystems. Wasn’t Rahm Emmanuel said: “Never let crisis go waste.”? truly hope so, ideal world everyone goes get vaccinated soon possibly can. know lot people resist vaccine never get even year safe distribution. think normalcy may return like late summer earliest, that's still optimistic. Anyone else think we're damned do, damned black?

If give black person, people say, ""oh sure, experiment black community (again, fair).""

If give white person it's, ""Oh sure, give life saving vaccine white people first!""

I hate world made think. COVID killed Santa. fuck america, gofundme thing real? even fuckin director white house security provided health insurance decent enough pay bills? get shit togheter. Germany one worst countries handling second wave. half-ass lockdown 6 weeks failed bring cases. Meanwhile virus killing 500 people every day don’t even rapid test caretakers nursing homes every day. People can't even spell simple words, think they're gonna know that? way understood mutations tend less severe virus cannot survive kills hosts becomes less fatal time. deadly cos new time evolve find equilibrium. main concern whether vaccine equally affective self righteous garbage seen today. 🤣 good know. Ridership 70 York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, largest transit agency nation, carried 8 million riders daily subway, buses two commuter rail systems pandemic. operations focused New York City, bore brunt coronavirus spring tens thousands people died. Weekday subway ridership currently 70% compared pre-pandemic levels. Weekday commuter rail ridership 75% 80%. That’s whole thing know nothing lol. Thank much answering. likely pfizer vaccine, studied vaccine yet can't say certainty yet. probability behaves like vaccines thing. since studied see prevented person taking vaccine getting infected whether spread it, get they're cautious now. yep, took online, honestly nice experimental section gone lol. got high enough score combined GPA background, go law school want. Trouble I've since questioned largely decided going route lol, nice know there.  accounts mostly, Sweden narrative manufactured forced early reopening.

It's like swedes give shit US though. understand statistics poisson noise. One study showing 4-0 anything concerning, studies two similar vaccines showing bells vaccine group least raises eyebrow -hence FDA’s guidance here. normal according nurse. decade graduating college wonder cared much things college, rest life college much better, least posture right actually work towards career know whole point vaccine keep people getting infected right? Honestly Amazon good place shop couple years IMO. go search product. There's 1 product (made China), gets sold 15 different nonsensical ""brand names"" sound like AI generated something. listing crammed 15,000 word description (do really need 17 paragraphs 4 graphics describe toilet paper holder?) reviews suspiciously detailed almost certainly fake.

NY Times actually ran great story earlier year. 

Anyway searched Men's Sweatpants, apparently today's hottest brands: BALEAF, ZENGVEE, urbciety, TAIBID, CENFOR, PROGO (they spell caps me) do? 22 voting members FDA utilized independent panel people seizing PPE, calling democratic hoax, etc.

Yeah, exactly get correlation. Yes, tons people America England taking seriously, see FDA.

Also, Europe going get Pfizer vaccine rest us currently getting? getting custom ""European"" version, one. near-100% vaccination nursing homes, possible mid-January

Keep mind two dose regimens, mid-January first wave immunized residents getting second dose. Someone gets first dose today won’t except see full effects vaccination late January. still good amount time left people screw things badly careful. *You permanently banned r/Coronavirus.* Aww bless widdle heart crisis thing, normal thing. stable geriatric patient chest pains droopy face 30 year old steering wheel lung one getting priority.

People want follow guidelines, cases surging. would've thought. Right, say destroyed know certain ruined, say longer certain still good. Big difference. understanding change future. say higher, would say price tax takes bigger chunk paycheck, does. really like argument human empathy drives people stay inside. suffered depression throughout rings self righteousness. promptly throw ocean.. efficient =/= effective. bad journalism Similarly, one look far back time remember agrichemical industry pushed ""anti-GMO people morons"" narrative left helping anti-GMO, mostly right-leaning people spread dumbest sounding pseudosciency stuff, combination hiring massive amounts shills social media defend companies every time certain products chemicals mentioned, corporations' revolving door regulators.

Their internal papers reveal knew dangers suppressed testing data showed sum total product harmful human health.

And see lawsuits go ads tv ""if loved one used -certain branded glyphosate- cancer"" company's sale European company, reddit's main reason existence help US-based corporations.

Sometimes attempts comically transparent, example ""moms GMOs"" group tried make thing fully consisted people already industry payroll. even bother hiring people neutral backgrounds, know current landscape surrounding ""pro-science"" ""anti-science"" debate is, little room critiquing practices companies absolute pro-science corporate-skeptical standpoint coming like loon. Nice! take yet? Score? ""Scottish Independence Growing, Partly Due English"" destroying natural ecology entirely rebuilding solely beneficial (to humans) structure? would choice, knowing much better vaccine available market. I’d say person classes good go. theory, people supposed wait herd immunity dispensing masks distancing whatnot. practice, though, guess they’ve received doses, lot people gonna stop point. it’ll interesting.  Corrected, ty. Totally fine, itll make getting vaccine much easier. Go away science common sense!, scaring me!

/s peer-reviewed data actually released trials, regarding either methods efficacy? I've heard scientists ~~getting thrown~~ falling windows Russia saying ""naw guys, totally works!"" feel lot better now. Get plenty rest drink fluids. Get Vitamin C too. 👍 I’m sorry. hell think trials were? got game? already *is* huge control group it’s literally safe vaccine. honestly don’t know what’s going get business stated matter? company work gone ahead making company permanently WFH, works coworkers this. 

If company said would return post-pandemic, bought houses anyway, that's stupid. think temperature primarily. Florida benefit essentially maintaining summer levels spread. makes sense figure high case count relative others policy everything warm, places getting cold effect cold spread may greater effect policy. Ok valid points, really do, realistically even option say six months even consider receiving vaccine COVID. still give window observe immedietely horrible repercussions. plenty time research scientific studies behind vaccine.

I doubts. never came saying degree expertise even gut feeling. One day gleefully line whole family another vaccine could save lives. year tense waiting shoe drop. Hopefully pessimism nothing. Masks work reduce spread. know many others much difficult virus-related experiences, parents (mid-70s additional risk-factors beyond age) really missing grandkids. 

They've also (and appropriately) careful. 

During summer, came masked, outdoor visits, masked outdoor get-togethers friends.  winter they've basically self-isolating, limited in-person interactions kind. 

I know weighing them, particularly missing Thanksgiving Christmas family. 

We're lucky they're taking seriously, there's none ""why come visit"" guilt families deal with, definitely feel them. 

Normally roll eyes say, ""we seen grandkids long"" - pandemic definitely switched dynamic to, ""Yeah, pretty big deal you."" 

For us younger, even pandemic lasts couple years, we've got lots time make it. older generations risk, really taking precious ""golden years"" retirement, old actually enjoy retirement. 

We couple ""bucket list"" trips planned well, I'm hoping get checked sooner rather later well. movies? understand Netflix exists, right? exactly decide people? live democratic societies (where applicable), majority people agree you, lost.  FDA reported exactly today regarding Yeah right. world CA cases higher Texas helps see doctors rushing get it. look much higher baseline - thats important. many travelled, many ***more*** travelled thanksgiving. basically textbook definition white privilege.

""why can't we... like... people man?"" :smokes bong rip:

we'd like live society matter. does, powerful celebrate accomplishments represented groups. inspire future generations. bodies piling floor hospital?  know can't say word ""logic"" win argument right? post opinion anecdotal muppet objective ""logic"" speak of? swear god many people think pepper words ""facts"" ""logic"" argument means win regardless fact logic involved. cringe inducing embarrassing. Haha poor people dumb someone explain moderna pfizer vaccines different one needs cold space needs normal freezer? Sounds like we’ll year understand correctly, location history starts moment enable exposure notifications. possible turned prior outbreak would've alerted you, assuming one people positive test result also enrolled program. really think trend going continue time goes on- unless turns horrible side effect justifies aversion.

Slaoui planning vaccinating hundred million people end February. We're going reach point everyone knows someone got vaccinated. point vaccine skepticism going wane much more, even disappear completely- never will, would stupid think we'd ever reach point.

What I'd like see vaccine tracker kind. I'd love know many people getting every state daily basis. I'll bet quickly paces number new positive cases, already. yesterday one indian co said vaccine 3 phase testing remain stable room temp 3 months. india cold storage transport storage issues saw first briefing Corona comission Sweden. delivered harsh criticisms towards political leadership well agencies. Something shifting swedish internal debate. Even social democrat-loyalist paper Aftonbladet raised idea locking down. evening paper compared us Denmark less spread Sweden, still locking down. days leading Christmas interesting. museums, movies, concerts, many schools aren’t offering enrichment. This! Simply put, one knows vaccinated people spread virus yet. People keep wearing mask figured science, yes are. Otherwise would agree General public probably going abandon masks early summer. 

I give one month now. Vaccinations started, everythings easypeasy back normal! /s I'm opposite, wildly unfunny shit point. Reddit loves beating dead, rotting horses. Reddit meme cancer. Prove wrong. effectiveness Pfizer vaccines fewer side effects. You’re good. Saving hundreds thousands lives worth temporary restrictions 2020. Saving 12 lives next summer continuing restrictions would idiotic. Wearing mask definitely hinders socialising quite significantly, anyway. I. spent pretty miserable NYE, stay inside (so fireworks) swore year would go out, maybe even travel NYE. Well... that's happening.

2021 awesome comparison 2020. Everyone does, choose argue bullshit.

Everyone gets plane, car goes doctor sick.

They'll argue bullshit, everyone still trusts science. Depends state. mostly frontline healthcare workers residents nursing homes getting vaccinated phase 1a. preference ED ICU workers ahead residents nursing homes. makes sense. fucking murderer appreciate type rather meaningless....

But could read words-of-horror without sending Internet Hug

Maybe 3 months pretty close normal day one tell paralysis right side face. tell I’m looking photos faintly see right eye less squinty left like said one realizes unless point out. I'm one people that, least currently, told avoid vaccine. severe food allergies prescription epi-pen. feeling narrow data I'll allowed get it, may able to. 

Still, important thing vulnerable population gets vaccine. large portion elderly. majority get it, healthcare workers get it, nursing home providers, etc death rates drop precipitously.

Then may get 90% whatever rest population voluntarily get it, going get well 50% population get (I think polls showing 60%+). addition, jobs likely require employees get (e.g. nursing homes anything elderly). Pretty quickly 70% IMO. point R0 going drop low levels transmission spotty. 

Masks stay. vaccine going prevent every single death reasons listed, exaggerating big issues reasons are. Deaths people vaccinated minimal, harsh sounds, acceptable level return normalcy. China country continually blaming local outbreaks surface transmission imports. Either testing streets ahead everyone planet, they’re full horse shit. Anti-vaxxers exist fucked experiments government done us past. Tukegee Study damaged trust government trying cure us. Bro, that’s people literally repulsed Donald Trump. people find repulsive. Like every way. don’t find repulsive? Yes, point similar flu symptoms go away randomly reappear. swing miss. realize people got pfizer vaccine 5 months ago right? Cool. one recalled yet?  It’s funny people actually believe live normally rest lives pandemic future zoonotic diseases pipeline due globalization, overcrowding, human encroachment wildlife. want live normally doesn’t mean happen. earth teeming 7 billion people insatiable resources normal earth. want live normally too. deep abnormality normal pipe dream. human baby getting bunch vaccines adulthood normal. I’m even antivaxxer. got shots. last one tetanus shot. come accept normalize it, look are. None normal. masks, vaccines, ok human abuse animals. know masks vaccines may necessary, covid going last virus face. Great news, [all need Johnson &amp; maybe I'll able hug grandma June. Exactly. vaccine distributed, simply possible make decision impacts health safety. primary concern endangering others, yourself. ""before"" analogy like drunk driving. harm cause importantly harm might cause others. ""after"" analogy (after high risk vaccinated everyone else) like drunk driving completely empty roadways. still risk yourself, self-contained putting others harms way. see you’re saying. sentiment shifted “apocalyptic” “genuine optimism” Election Day (month?). I’m happy it

But 17,000 people died last week US COVID. Jobless claims jumped again. It’s awesome right now. That’s really smart, never thought — Surging coronavirus outbreaks number nations forcing governments close schools, despite initial promises keep open latest country change course Germany, schools move distance learning Wednesday part tougher new lockdown rules. Widening outbreaks also triggered closure schools Netherlands Asia, South Korean capital, Seoul, opted similar measures school closures Germany Netherlands mark notable turnaround Europe, governments said fall keeping schools open would priority, arguing aren’t significant drivers coronavirus outbreaks. Zero culture? think understand thay word means. need concerts sports culture. You’re significantly optimistic nature humans trust taking it, give precautions early, actually get second dose. Let alone possible manufacturing delays, etc. hope god he’s right happen, it’s truly best case scenario. worry I've enjoyed flu exactly 30 years. I'm worried it. Second vaccine? lol, winged first one? get second one corrected find whats wrong first one? Same. Idk one specifically it’s 2020 crazier things happened Ain't conservacuck democuck. 2 different vaccines? I'm sure WFH culture die completely many roles 5 years, kept permanently.

Yeah know this. know company altered plans regarding office move place expected time (we've WFH exception rule while) WFH mostly norm.

Everything 'hoteling' oriented. surrounded non-vaccinated people risk *they causing*. me.

I make comments intellectual research typical opinion opposed vaccinations thoroughly incapable anti-vax comment made burden proof prove brainwashed moron. use ""semblance"" choice here. We'll start getting back normal around March good number people it. STARTING. We'll able things again, etc. September-November 2021 things back COMPLETELY normal (sold concerts, 100k football stadium, etc). Assuming best guess. saw expected Moderna stock shoot morning. Nah, it’s actually dropping. Shit makes sense. people working Hell months, they’re allowed engage celebratory behavior there’s hope horizon? Good luck getting people that. Thank you. quite simple testing would done repeatedly period time. Testing stability mRNA nano lipid something happens full phase 1 study -- skipping studying independently, got market faster. 

A guess part, calculated risk seemed acknowledging logistical problems relying ultra cold storage knowing major cities throughout world would able handle would appreciate working vaccine X months sooner tested fully. Ah look super busy overwhelmed!!!!! haven’t done research, asking us? I'm glad wrong this, I'm still gonna wear mask shot, good know accidentally infecting people don't. guess legitimately dumb. death rate 1% thats THIRTY SIX MILLION DEAD AMERICANS without mitigation efforts. think anyone would notice that. Selfish garbage.  incredibly stupid. Maybe look death rate instead posting stupid comments. Enjoy taking vaccine studied couple months dummy Heck, regular medical insurance cover it?? He's DIRECTOR SECURITY WHITE HOUSE insurance taking care it??!?! How? News. You’ll actually forced get real life social distance done. must terrifying! long pandemic yet last? realistic timeframe moment? find old threads i'm really wondering long yet last. feeling vaccine end virus. He’s said got antibodies, no. take backsies, apparently. first paragraph correct, way home home period time likely tested. colleges consistent regular testing students means. 

midwest definitely, california lead country towards another overall peak especially large state a(nother) peak. seen information states listed RT live showing pretty bad increases country believed.

i can't tell misleading january haha, that's one many unfortunate things year...no one knows right late matter Yeah, really greatest generation. name suited character. worst pandemic ever it’s going get worse though. Vaccines won’t make dent Cool, bud. Let's see supposed, planned, yet actually constructed field hospitals ever actually get used. I'm thinking last spring many built yet (fortunately) ended needed.

And cut shit citations. know sub full ""my mom nurse entire ICU beeh full weeks, bodies stacked outside morgue full"" stories get thousand upvotes awards. Nobody ever asks citations crazy shit.

But someone expresses little bit skepticism hospitals truly overrun, even sources actual data like state's usage tracker: ""oh God cite sources!!!!"". Speaking arguing bad faith...

Tell Mr Citation, find single state there's actual data showing actual 100%+ utilization hospital resources. I've checked supposed hotspot states seen nothing sort. 

Or reply personal attacks norm sub, translates ""I've got nothing"". Either way I'm good. fuck brother, hell year (I saying jest... people truly think way. It’s scary...) hospital work giving away vaccine employees next 2-3 weeks. fun. lovely person... last group receive vaccine point irrelevant. like someone still hope. People like show modern miracles happen. guys actual miracles eyes. gets world back feet again. forever grateful men women worked tirelessly pump vaccines treatments. really hope medical field recognized federal holiday par veterans day. never excited receive shot life. hate getting shots.  love it! know lives Appalachia. need drive mountains.  let infections holiday burn out. things closed slow spread Christmas gatherings. Link Sweden cant lock is. implement pandemic law spring would take 4-5 days use again. yes, lock down. Sadly dont 50 double blind randomized placebo studies regarding lockdowns, won’t happen likely. least figure wait figure still spread 1st, get everyone still waiting vaccine sick.

And quickly after, either, going find much less effective right vaccination, well. Keep lid booster, least sense.

We go back normal spread slows point major burden, vaccinated. try go back normal soon without facts, take longer.

Seriously, y'all would never survived serious plague attitude. baby plague terms human history even year in. Back normal less 2 years amazing is. works people would start wearing begin with. Thank Well vaccinated before, continue get vaccinated future. agree development vaccines...

That makes anti-vax. new normal crew members going hope someone gets bad side effects Can't fix stupid. can’t get either those. They’re FDA approved. were, offered you, take it. would mean they’d gone rigorous approval process. that's fair. ten years younger might said that, part college friendships lasted longer friendship Losing ceo major disruption, that's highly paid employee Martha Blackburn wants give everyone TN gift. is. Humidity good virus, might keeping people outside though. Again, snow-flakey piece light fabric becomes much burden say “fuck it, I’d rather people lost family members wear thing anymore.” require lot experience industry knowledge...

Boy, sure glad aren’t advising medical personnel  Could be. plus side, microchip! agree man. wife work service industry Nashville shit, gun head. worst people world come town. Ah. first comment invisible '/S'. people saw that. too. still, weird, Trump tries rake credit operation warp speed (he added fantasy facts though, financed developed Pfizer/Biontech's vaccine); anti-vax reps now? tree bark, say. lol VULNERABLE PEOPLE TAKE VACCINE.

And feel bad people, genuinely do. limit much sacrifice people demand rest population, believe we're close limit already.

Frankly I'm surprised seen widespread disregard masking mandates now. vaccine widely available anybody get im done masks. entering building  word good test is? I'm worried false negatives causing people congregate. So, Dr. Doug says vaccine may safe clinics trials 5 years long. antivaxxer bullshit typical Evangelical Christian tilt. someone familiar “science” never welcome necessary mention God giving professional scientific opinion topic; exactly article does. reeks right wing antivax propaganda. Christmas? damage done. personally, matter. trust government EU 100%. Whatever vaccine say safe, take. Whenever offered group.  

But people skeptical towards vaccines, especially word ""emergency approval"" attached it. Classic. IMHE criticized lot people projections absolutely failing match reality much stock I'd put claims 

Especially experts claimed getting high risk groups protected could lower death toll much 99% since people 60 without outside risk factors contracting severe cases statistically rare amount people get vaccine. could done masks much sooner, large chunk people cooperate, prolonging rest us. understand people well. verge taking mask myself. give till February maybe March till fucking snap. reinfections, thus far, rare Surprisingly, see anything data suggest Thanksgiving effect current situation. Nothing.

You mention deaths, lagging indicator lets start cases. \[The current surge cases started Nov. 1 even Oct 18 depending interpret (Click seven day rolling average button use link.) leveling Thanksgiving holiday, would expect (as happens example weekends) upsurge cases Thanksgiving (again expect catch up), back regular weeks data collection. Problem extrapolate curve Thanksgiving, would actually higher level now. That's probably part due lockdowns, are, way saying Thanksgiving spiked case curve.

\[Next, let's look story. Pre-Tha'nksgiving curve extrapolates higher.

And finally deaths, also first link above. current rise deaths started Nov 18, leveled holidays, people dying people working. rise started holidays, expect lagging indicator. now, extrapolated, we're would thought Thanksgiving.

I've watching see effect Thanksgiving data data around country, really see it. Perhaps Massachusetts, even there, looks like went Thanksgiving break little early.

Nationally, I'd say small effect. Instead surge surge Fauci called it, turned rise flattening curve. \[Cases seem flattening 200K instead Nevertheless, hard see data becomes noisy around extended holiday. Uhh must realize many anti vax people rich. Bill gates children's doctor said vaccinated. Right scientists focusing energy designing, producing improving vaccines therapeutics COVID. debate want later historians get involved. get another check. politicians re-elected reason incentive give us another check. People fooled politician. That's good, kick cattle, poultry, pigs house. That's worth other? Nope. Bye bye dummy That's hikers still wear masks, least around do. already adopted trail etiquette. passing someone, expected cover mouth, already.

Luckily, lot trails much less packed winter hiking, anyway. mask also super helpful got cold. nose never warm. Anthrax vaccine Please enlighten Ya know virus live door handles phone screens, etc? Well also still live mouth/saliva even vaccine, like electric bug zapper comes contact part body. could potentially still spread others even vaccine Maybe, end needs declared official end pandemic gets plastered across news people start acting like there's reason concerned anymore. country plans ready, hundred thousands vaccines distribution centers, waiting EU approval. understanding, ""go date"" set January 7th This. wear mask vaccine, I’ll feel much safe living life. don’t give shit aren’t vaccinated, long brethren are. could simply administer saline solution you’d never know it. plot twist: got placebo Yeah mine just. open. yesterday went. printout sign door, small read drive thru blocked info. Ah ok. seen surveys willingness different groups take vaccine, lately. 'Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist devised no-lockdown approach, estimated 40 per cent people capital, Stockholm, would immune Covid-19 end May': Look total population age group. .01% number? 

Do think you’re going get older someday? China caused shit begin with, terrible wet markets hundreds exotic animals packed together causing virus jump species, made everything worse trying silence every medical proffesional tried warn people initial phase pandemic. thats even beginning describe theyre hong kong Xinjiang (which genocide). chinese “shining light” managed get virus control (because basically locked everyone houses without taking proper measures care first) lie numbers way might want ask definition “shining light” Boy dumb Get dinner rushes stuff runs short line cooks throw whatever plate doctors?  don’t get sick don’t turn virus factory. 

the quantity virus enters body dealt immune system, never turns cells replication engines. people weak immune systems keep wearing masks. I'm sick mentality ""normal people cater abnormal people."" difference emergency approval regular one makes trust regular one more?  Thank much! honestly didn’t know! think even 5.5 percent get coronavirus lower risk serious complications death lot. sure read that, source link probably buried subreddit somewhere. fun sitting basement next summer rest world living :) mean, I’m super optimistic future pandemics sure hell seems like learned nothing wedding end April. I’m hoping help help somewhat normal wedding. earth downvotes this? honestly (knock wood) don’t remember last time got cold. may wear mask time outside house.  Plus it’s warm winter  told Satan's microchips undetectable modern science? mean, Satan. prince darkness. ruler Hell. Pretty sure drop microchips every vial nerds even know it! American living Europe seems lot distrust amongst people whether vaccines safe quickly produced; going standard approval hopefully helpbsome people trust vaccination process more. 

I'm sure enough reason go emergency approval. Yes, get vaccine quicker may lose trust number people, general public able get vaccine months now. view (safely) get thing ASAP people trust wait trust it.

By way, directed you, since speaking behalf might distrust also issue bloc solidarity. beginning pandemic, allocation resources uneven throughout EU created lot problems, especially since stability EU major concern right pandemic serving stress test well bloc handle widespread crisis. making sure repeat mistakes spring seems key agenda politicians here

I definitely understand this, although definitely sticky situation.    you’re going round 175 million people don’t get vaccinated exactly? Unbelievable. Dont think couldve done right here. Take vaccine = selfish prick. take vaccine =OMG LETHAL FIRST U GET AUTISM N START WALKING BACKWARDS!!

Edit: even take vaccine antivaxxers could say ""oh thats real vaccine"". know what. ombre. sounds like joke it’s true. personally know 10 people vocal vaccines. America screwed. Particularly rural America information readily available me. Good luck.

Prof. Drosten pointed several studies concluding children driving pandemic done time schools closed. can't promise aamet, I'll get vaccine, too. :D reply needs upvotes mean start counting reason eventually hit 675,000

&amp;#x200B;

The issue death rate markedly higher projected death rate 2020. Yeah fuck America We’ve come alternative formulas populations flu vaccines. 

Covid-19 little bit newer haven’t got yet one.. Never, orders made health department orders. make charges stick, need provide direct link someone got injured died direct result someone behavior. basically impossible “Lower” doesn’t mean non-existent. mortality rate lower younger people last line vaccine, “low” rate still quite bit higher respiratory virus we’re used dealing with. 

Especially everyone already masks would braindead stop wearing news don’t sound scary anymore. Oh well Conspiracy much? reason suspect worry cutting line came testing covid One pictures empty beds. sayin. new information, though perhaps researchers. remember seeing paper six eight months ago.

Still, great idea fantastic technology. Note approach work current pandemic, future pandemics well. get kind stuff place, better be. know zero cases, fucking live here. Saying last line lying.

The entire world needs vaccines us safe. Trying decide country deserves priority get first what's selfish.

Pfizer delivering vaccines countries need RIGHT NOW. We're getting first vaccines March. far first line.

I understand scared acting like fucking child internet deal feelings. People seem feed terror chaos.  stop. sound ridiculous it’s embarrassing welcome! bummer world works way. Good luck Civil War part 2 stranger! password ""Oooorrrrggggyyyyy"" qualifications going hundreds doctors scientists worked vaccines? regurgitating Facebook? Yes did, sars fucked never got funded. work used build went Oxford one start scratch. Except timeline US🤔 Oh, feel you. recently battle just-turned-three year old mittens. Luckily, live a.mostly warm climate son would probably choose frostbite gloves. Haha no, even say anything go. meant completely tongue cheek.

But serious accountability part. Though seem like Sununu blaming guy dying much guy, others, actively contributing problem ""because they're told opposite"". Cause that's really what's going months now.

We control behavior this, behavior others. stay away them. No, company requires get vaccine find someone else work support parents many ways.

I support ""they young"" reason make exceptions rules put life jeopardy.

It's also students wear masks classroom. really don’t get happened, could explain tech development since 1989, science solid, works. Really? Like really want like seems bit good true. see like June so. (I'm like doctor anything, I've given normal first year high school) They're testing more, flu seasons, numbers based self reported numbers, wonder people many years think flu actually it, made inflated numbers. Also flu tests pretty inconclusive. also leads believe lot possible positive flu infections labeled negative they're getting negative tests.

Also looking numbers find, seem similar 2011-2012 season, low, charts low. I'm shocked, shocked tell you, administration missed details required roll out. masks going kill children?

Where say masks kill children? [latest data point still stands.

If relevant enough, know tell you. even end 2020 takes time compile info. Damn right divided, we’ve old civil war years. would look back Spain (he’s Spanish), Spain (the whole EU actually) still hasn’t approved vaccine still vaccinations. Long story short, can’t it. safe safe groups people? Fucking dumb asses People absolutely upset skipped line Anyone feels like makes less confidence vaccine looking excuse ignore science. Saying “I think others get it, *I’m* going wait” extremely hypocritical propagates baseless fear. reality need 75% vaccinated *minimum* go maskless based surveys half Americans don’t want get vaccine. Whether choose vaccinate impact you, impacts everyone. Frankly, unless you’re expert pharmaceutical research virology, don’t think get pretend like know better health experts pushing vaccine. think getting different random celebrity. stay safe run whole operation. reasons medical staff go first wondering trying put big mask her. wonder freaking would cover almost whole face. parents definitely fucked there. something screwy first data release? Congratulations. live state current hospitilzation load covid 248 per million, highs April 577 per million.  trending up, nobody accurately determine current wave crest.  Cost/benefit. good way forward, bad worse ways. choices significant pain involved. Currently calculus means choice social distancing, masks, partial lockdowns least painful - people's livelihoods suffering, education suffering, mental health suffering. risks covered balance changes. make sense level economic destruction save small handful lives. Life risk, prior 2020 accepted risk. 2021. though? vaccine stop transmission. never take granted ever again.

Give year Essential workers aren’t getting yet. He’s seeing patients he’s first that’s fine know it’s vaccine water?  public health prioritizing quality lifespan? not? sure. discriminate legal basis. science denying moron protected current legal framework. Well considering states strict lockdowns still blowing cases guess intelligent people would little skeptical. Sorry willfully ignorant. 2 year olds definitely wear mask ease. feel 2 year old capable that, bring plane. airline posted policy I'm sure parent young child probably interested said policy boarding ignored anyway. money virus going mutate vaccine worthless. half population gets vaccine, that's plenty people infect, mutate vaccine effective more. Honestly, feel like 50% really optimistic estimate vaccination, realistically probably lower. knew scientist woman title alone. Go figure. hope so. point willing accept level risk reward return normalcy. Hopefully next year get herd immunity (hopefully then, virus controlled enough basically health impact standard flu, risk willing assume). control, isn't, would suck, gotta gotta do. would kill like 40,000 year (like typical flu season), point we'd need return normalcy live risk. don’t enough common ground regards rights. Thanks time. look like announced provide statement response question it. Millions also heard rest statement.


Just saying. people year others whole life. 

Quality quantity Schools went person distance learning. done cut transmission anything. students buildings, parents going office anymore, kids home again. It’s reason Minnesota began falling cases prior latest shutdown, larger school districts transitioned distance learning sometime November. Let’s real weren’t getting ass 😂  Yes. would take vaccine. says get heard encourage people get it. Literally opposite headline ""just take extra year school"" terrible advice lol. upvoted much? take extra year hell it. Finish schedule get job start making money. save enough use money graduate program appeals want college time. take half schedule stretch lol. hospitals verge collapsing ""I say would trust Donald Trump would credible source information talks efficacy reliability whatever he's talking about,"" continued clip. meant bit hyperbole demonstrate agreement article. Obviously considered insensitive could come across fraught situations intention. Peace.  I'm sure spare one dose, mind cut line show us confident safety. stronger immune response likely die. immune system literally destroyed lungs trying kill cells hosted virus Thank you! appreciate reading actually said taking time point out

I've noticed comes child safety I've downvoted quite heavily past well commenting kids car seats safetest without layers, (the post cutest baby smiling snow suit loose carseat straps) strange reddit usually pro science

I take word it': Kamala Harris says would trust Trump alone coronavirus vaccine

Kamala said September Trump kept promising vaccine ""very"" close team reason world going get vaccine. number test subjects duration tests? Yup, I'll take potential covid ICU trip /r/LongHaulers symptoms day long.  Nice stereotyping bud Conspiracy much? know listen governments crisis like this. That's globally. faith know best public. backed several experts. lot people true.  ~~High risk~~ elites Read long comment, virus frustrating thing get extreme right wing family basis. hospitals verge collapsing many full. aren’t full covid patients, get point, it’ll disaster making.....beyond epic disaster already middle of.  9/11 day. enough you? everyone voice reason, /u/Big_Titty_Fart69 post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  think *you* understand. Fuck yea bro, looks like PC wont getting covid anytime soon, many LED's. isolate mask today save lives vulnerable. vulnerable protected vaccine, spread matter. scientists saying virus gonna mustate vaccine gonna stop working there's evidence show trend go way vaccine distributed thoroughly.

When happen [Pfizer said provide 25 million doses U.S. end sure bunch countries bidding vaccines, bet everyone vaccinated end 2021. That’s cause it’s already ripped thru NY. even anyone left could kill? [There enough data know still catch transmit Covid even 5% chance, anyone. makes chance severe illness longterm effects *for you* incredibly low. builds immune responses necessarily make completely immune.

That's masks distancing still important everyone opportunity get one, enough data confirm prevent transmission.

Unfortunately many people acting like stop things right barely anyone it, seeing explode. 

Best case somewhat normalcy late Summer, based under-ordering already everything else gone year may next Fall put behind us. 50% take it, probably longer. Lack national guidance honesty allowing bad actors want continued chaos control narrative. economy start recovering unless excess deaths closer normal ranges thousands day creating possible life long health issues. I'm already concerned longterm cost unless Healthcare access improved.

We talk anyone know afraid get it, thinks need to, misinformed continuing safety practices, best provide correct information encourage participate get hellhole faster. adjusted population America Spanish flu would kill far more. population much less back can't wait go back gym lift properly again.

At least gives something look forward to. hell hard hats? now. enough interested healthcare workers vaccine needs secured like controlled substance. thing dont justify anything, like cuomo closed schools cause passed 3% infection rate decided limit.
and vaccine widely available april-june doesnt mean people stop dying, cause starting vaccinating 18y-60 vaccinate half them, take 10-24 months.

the KEY be: magic number OKish daily deaths every governor, worse, since deaths go way vaccines, maybe care infections way longer.
its them, every state different tresshold might encourage people take so... I'm eyeing next hockey season. Maybe Devils break heart then. completely separate Pfizer one?

Edit: yeah clarified *finished*. start work it.  want hug stranger man cool, like really give flying fuck think Problem don’t good markers yet (why not????) unlucky are. Obviously likely older heart disease stuff, walk away without scratch. Meanwhile kills 23 year old explanation, gives 30 year old debilitating dysautonomias. we're stuck forever. Spanish flu ended way worse now. heavily slow pace COVID vaccines never get point Spanish flu. went couple years finally fizzled things went back normal back then. There's zero reason believe we'll wearing masks 10 years unless becomes culture world wide mask sick, point COVID. That’ll happen governor puts infected elderly homes. Pfizer Moderna vaccines completely different baby. Google “how MRNA vaccines work” prepare mind blown. Why? don’t option get phase 3/4 anyways Thanks. wish facility best luck stay healthy. feel like criminal shopping walmart trust vaccine yet...

Social media going take conspiracy theory. I've largely seen support individuals. seem actually view small doses loss.

Personally suggestions make uncomfortable athletes. would loss, think would, would cause many get vaccinated, it'd gard guarantee choice since many exploited. Never seen problem, found weird used @ (since inside could taken whichever)

but guess simplicity, 1 quick tap instead hold tap a, three taps a/o

also x stand variable, attributed anything works I'm going go bar sit like drunk.

I'm still lazy dance clerb. believe that! got sick frequently kid. Yeah, aren’t yet point care skeptics think. Give frontline healthcare workers EMTs option worry percent skeptics need win over.  think procedures schedule need ICU available case complications. consequences delaying procedures could theoretically long term. Yeah made go hmm Sounds like bar conduct expect citizens country sadly pretty low. Don’t give medical attention catch it. it’s “just flu.” precisely they're bad employees (and competitors, third party sellers site) good customers, probably entirely implying feel like bitching ah yes, mafia, heroic Another long term disability cost... restrictions? shots Pfizer Moderna vaccines. Russian Sputnik vaccine different shots. definitely Chinese Communist Party infiltrated Pfizer CEO knows what's actually it. take vaccine? clearly don’t care keeping fellow citizens alive, pretend do? It’s vaccine, racism. It’s false equivalency. don’t know unintended effects vaccine yet can’t prove it’s safe yet things banking really need person all... like ever. can't think anything can't drive thru Oh, thought didn’t know sure, fauci co bet help abate transmission, too. guess that’s still air. understand fair point. Never meant imply somehow entitled vaccine one first get it. I'ts feel quite lot disconfort management country (at least know of) made pandemic. Also, government refuse let know talks laboratories, rising concerns kind deals making. 

I live Colombia, country South America, sadly deal corruption violence nation wide; thats video one magisters saying wait least 2022 general public get vaccine, private jet mask properly placed seems touched sore nerve. 

What really wish for, get guarantee whenever get vaccine, that's best representatives could do, got sell corrupt party premium rest us watch homes pay taxes. 

Sorry rant broken english. good holiday :) want family's business recover loses year :( fine. get Regeneron’s antibody treatment good medical care general. sure people serving them. Lately, Fauci pretty much everything camera. think saw change socks CNN. Thank you. Given credentials I'd go even say ""low-tier"" speculation opinion. virus exquisitely suited human host (more known animal) case since beginning pandemic. something definite discovered unscientific ignore another plausible hypothesis.  Hi! think subreddit FAQ would useful help clear misconceptions!  Thanks! :D No, let's look science says.

You know well that's enough. people could relied upon trust science, global warming problem. wanna go play board games Vaccines often take 4 8 years develop measure long term side effects.

That take long. take long due lack funding lack volunteers form test groups. shifting all. 
My friend working big hospital, almost staff get vaccine. says try make get vaccine, sit rest pandemic. 
MANY people want take vaccine. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) floated negotiators leave state local aid provision liability shield,

This really feels like, ""hurt"" businesses (by giving blanket protection covid lawsuits), they'll make sure hurt state local government, hurt people without ability make money, state local governments invariably go cut services raises taxes meet budget shortfalls.  doubt it. think winter rough. went cross-eyed like Louis Black reading title. gentleman... LOL grandpa died covid nursing home. ""frail"" either - mild dementia mobility issues, easily would lived 5-10 years barring sort sudden issue (like aneurysm something.)

It relatively early things, especially rural area, taking precautions. took patient local hospital - patient tested negative, positive next day.

His roommate died first. favorite nursing assistant (really one liked) got sick day did, either (she thankfully completely recovered.) sick days, reported looking better. second day looking better started yelling people demanding RC Cola, encouraging, normal behavior.

The next morning called, saying Mom Grandma could go wanted, Mom decided much risk Grandma. died half hour later.

There two significant outbreaks home in. (there subreddits help that) free post links, course, bear mind overinterpreting data misinterpreting results, treated misinformation. Yeah, understand skeptics force take it, I’d rather one doctor, nurse, paramedic received it. I’m upset US officials denied gravity situation cutting line. pregnant animals? Yeah you’re right. biggie. Aren’t glad we’ve informed relax now?

Dude unfortunate enough shoes loved one I’d want choke anyone says anything like troll. way. makes difference imo. two year old throwing temper tantrum refusing something pretty normal even best parents. 

But clearly two year olds fault here. plays role, it’s role. Google saves office fees many employees slowly descend craziness home, chasing kids licked pets. different him, charge one companies made damn thing seen hesitant take vaccine. Yeah, no. can’t fix stupid. concerning feel like CEO take vaccine produce. head company, able ensure vaccine safe, better way CEO deal health concerns product creates. child definitely inherited attitude mother. accept $.30 day premium worth amount use it. Like guy said, cut cable years ago. I'm willing spend couple bucks that, get free ~~google play~~ yt music anyway, reason paying it, way around. different paying spotify perspective, also bonus get skip ads youtube. Plus you’re essential worker, you’re likelier poorer younger live people. think early days China’s bout, big issue got it, home multigenerational complexes. Ditto Italy. obvious China like, lock-and-key locked down. Seriously, know many people saying wouldn’t now, months issues would. It’s pretty likely number go it’s irrational “antivax” watch wait. Keep mind vaccine ISNT EVEN APPROVED yet. give time. Probably long that. March given incoming. said Americas wanted get vaccine 60% best case scenario, got downvoted. people wanted ""scientific data"" ""polls"". Then, linked poll mods deleted comments.

Guess optimistic. actually serious following news vaccine making funny? Early right close. 0 issues area included 1A vaccine groups Latino different Latin.

In US (where used most), basically means Hispanic How's nursing staff levels? Although Astrazeneca test weekly, reported efficacy numbers [don't include asymptomatic primary efficacy analysis included **symptomatic COVID-19** seronegative participants nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab 14 days second dose vaccine.

They include couple numbers efficacy asymptomatic infections, they're worthless (confidence intervals generally running negative 50% positive 50%) due extremely small sample sizes. report low-dose/standard-dose regimen asymptomatic efficacy high 50s, but, again, that's worthless 95% confidence interval 1% 82.9%. Odd cool... I'm it, hope contribute! respect integrity seen hesitant take vaccine.  normal though it... Santeria. I'll see hell. opposite happend daycare. None staff children contracted COVID since reopening April (Norway). soon opened students come work/practical studies, first case. student. Everyone near contact quarantined tested. None came back positive. Noone sick symptoms. Kids playing 2 whole days, even picture kid 1m indoors. masks used since reopening either. Europe: learned moving US. guess WWI took precedence. Two sides every story. one side - sympathize. 2 year old godson friends kids around 2. kid doesn’t wanna put mask, child put mask. 

My friends flying January (or supposed to) started conditioning 2YO. got mask baby doll frame positive. “Oh we’re running store! Let’s put fun masks on! Don’t forget baby’s mask!”

On hand, based dad talking, I’d bet story. dad used lot “anti mask” language wearing mask correctly. gave break since heat mask may slipped without realizing may taken second put back properly Damn Santa, where's Christmas miracle?? japanese living bolivia daughter almost 2 seen grandparents mom's side outside skype cancelled Dulles Narita flights would taken place July-August thst booked October before. unnecessary, yes. Sucks, especially dont need endanger elderly grandparents it. Lol it’s said [CNN interview Dr also said likely receiving vaccine publicly attempt reassure people safety efficacy. Nonsense.

Some least populated areas America experiencing highest infection rates. Melbourne less dense New York, still larger denser US city Chicago Los Angeles.

Stop making excuses poor leadership selfish people. America could virtually covid-free now. chose be. ideal youre talking about. Definitions exist. That's correct. Mine say that, buy act like it. ~~want cut line~~ among first. Even live video getting crazies would say fakr  True story. Sadly likely Trump never entirely gone Mooch needed time come.

Bleh. Agree. guess kinda venting. It’s long year peak frustration today last days working yes agree. healthy level skepticism normal. understand domes desire jump board everyone I’ve talked healthcare opposed first round. We’ve already thrown wolves don’t want guinea pigs now. Bill gates? Isn’t choice parents though? would never force family anyone. I’m going deprive parents grandchildren. sorry don’t think right intrude family decisions like this. consenting adults bonds parents kids. get make tons money sued CEO ""waiting"" take vaccine! sketchy me. trust vaccine yet...

They announced ""works"" day preplanned stock sale.

Take worth. I'll take mean I'm getting Moderna AstraZenica version turn comes. people positions power authority get vaccine (on video) improve public acceptance vaccine. care less bullshit attempts look fair (we know rich people get hands vaccine early) convincing many people possible vaccines safe. confirmed.

A ""confirmation"" academic pursuit. clinical. nearly impossible ""confirm"" reinfection people people saved samples first infection, previously stated. Additionally, homologous reinfection possible, even first sample saved, able confirmed sequencing come back significantly different. understanding far likely people continuing test positive prolonged period time vs. getting reinfected.

That studies early pandemic. serology testing started come indicating lack immunity around 7% known infected patients. confirmed reinfections discovered. surge cases comes greater chance reinfection due increased potential exposed virus second time. would fairly rare immunologically person that's recovered continue test positive 90 days. Yes far opt-outers limiting factor. trust isn’t built whim. It’s built time. Crap like (“oh, don’t want cut line”) erodes trust long-haul. don’t know doesn’t get vaccine. Perhaps PR folks told better look (look me, I’m forgoing vaccine now, others need more). Perhaps doesn’t trust safety “I won’t cut line” great pretext. Perhaps actually take vaccine it’s “good guy” PR. actually says scenario absolutely won’t believe in. simply doesn’t add up. Doesn’t make sense. provides reasons execs taking vaccine makes sense leaving doses others. truly wanted leave dose others building public trust / showing trust - he’d administer someone family qualify right (wo “cutting line”).

I’m old believe CEOs huge corps altruistic. I’m wearing tinfoil hat either - they’re only-greed-driven, fundamentally bad people either. 

Put simply - he’s saying reeks bullshit. Erodes trust. don’t believe him. make drug give millions billions people I’m sure people would ease guy made actually took it. He’s obviously waiting see real results vaccine are. Duh. Don’t know U downvoted comment. It’s honest people saying. Like said, there’s telling many people even available 6 months limited supply anyway. I’m saying I’m worried time know either safe take discovered consequences. Either way it’s realistic expect get anytime soon would Fauci want people get vaccine safe? going make money anything. vaccine dangerous life become much difficult. government set cannot sued issues arising taking Unfortunately optics make simple decision be. Yes, ideal world CEO get dose people need more, but... non-insignificant amount front line workers see decide hold taking vaccine. (I'm saying that's right, is). get early dose publicly save lives. Searching far wide? literally nothing letting millions people take unproven vaccine says confidence.

The vaccine ""unproven"". proven safe effective.

He knows things anyone else reads study Wow, that’s horrific. headlines front pages Reddit calling European idiocy? Seems like there’s massive bias shitty website.... Yea fuck buy shit wants see mass test first...his age group different environments...you can't become ceo want know whole story first... Thanks fetching data. interesting. much, seems indicate community spread. You’re wrong. kind adhere happiness = expectations - reality expected actively fucking COVID fact he’s “encouraging” masks passive stuff “this fine” dog. also always vote him, get people don’t hate him. Sure, months needing people vaccinate, current supply important people imo There’s literally nothing letting millions people take unproven vaccine says confidence.

People may look “selfish” took first, would know took first knows beyond shadow doubt works. screams skepticism.

COVID devastating, half Americans unsure vaccine, even believe money grab Pfizer, right wrong, that’s way is. taking would help disprove that.

That’s 2 cents. there’s literally nothing could tell would make thing “vote confidence”. RIP Probably popular comment I'll go anyway...

I absolutely *can not* understand anyone actively chose get pregnant summer. “lingering fatigue” conflating “Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” mentioned second article. Lingering Fatigue CFS.

This entirely argument semantics similar article first one basically says lingering fatigue symptom Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that's mean. fatigue. 

Like dunno think scientists would care covid patients feeling little sleepy recovering 80% returning work symptoms severe enough. 

But whatever. care anymore. Guess we'll find two years long term symptoms covid patients bad enough crash whatever social safety net fucking have. Can't wait. 

Anyways, wear mask. None things would impact anyone would they. Pretty much like someone want vaccine wear mask. wearing mask protected wearing one... get vaccination effective give rats ass everyone else world refuses vaccine since safe. 

The reality pushing control people reprehensible.  seat belts, wear wear motor cycle helmet - crash die what. Butter? fan taste thank much.... exercise, well ran numbers number years gained exercise less total amount time wasted exercising, driving gym bullshit goes it. can't math feel free piss away 7 years life gain 5. course.. became political. easily pleased PS5 George Gao, head China's CDC, say masks back March.
""The big mistake U.S. Europe, opinion, people aren’t wearing masks. virus transmitted droplets close contact. Droplets play important role—you’ve got wear mask, speak, always droplets coming mouth. Many people asymptomatic presymptomatic infections. wearing face masks, prevent droplets carry virus escaping infecting others."" Lots people first time anxiety. Pretty normal people feel confronted something new. number people willing take vaccine wil go coming months people wil gotten it. herd mentality wil help us there. got one? ok, let get one too. real question, people cancel Prime subscriptions stop shopping Amazon? Uh That’s insanely scary... I'm guessing never worked multinational. Thanks layers CYA happening way chain, CEO never know truth product. never win conspiracy theorists, hard stop.
For actually bit skeptical, I’d simply remember vaccine less effective promised, let alone dangerous, would big PR disaster Pfizer could possibly imagine.
I don’t need believe acting good faith; need believe value massive amount value tied Pfizer stock realize amount blood governments fail. director Pfizer taking way meaningful Dr saying take it. CEO taking makes wander enough wish take yet. CEO pharmaceutical company developed vaccine save literally millions upon millions people non-essential you? would appear lost time. Go bed. Truly human. I've genuinely never seen group people obviously care themselves.  family get it? people contact get it? Yeah articles good, comments looney. maybe isn’t data long term side effects?

No pharma ceo good person. Don’t fooled him. Like things covid, half country upset. 

If puts first, he’s asshole. 

If doesn’t take it, it’s becomes conspiracy doesn’t trust vaccine. 100% agree, people going get mad either way. governor state live getting vaccine yet. He’s waiting healthcare workers nursing home/long term care nurses get first. Someone Facebook commented leader get first he’s piece shit leader not. next comment people praising allowing first responders get first since they’re currently short supply. WTF, someone always going mad matter do. Take breath, you’re overreacting reported trial began. here’s Pfizer’s protocol search Google next time? Tired ""i know what's it"" bullshit. read exactly what's it.

""I'm stupid understand what's it"" like it. model test spreading scenarios, help.

Even herd immunity possible vaccine decreases chance bad case covid, hella better. Nope, bullshit. 1 year old wears mask choosing. difference need get used flight. Getting plane time teach them. messed up. would gotten used beforehand would nonissue. ""We've done literally nothing suffer incompetence get vaccine wait"" - right now. like require people work hospitals get flu shot every year, require get COVID vaccine. Hospitals layoffs due COVID hesitate fire people refuse vaccine. Well would draw complaints family getting special treatment nepotism they’re using position privilege benefit family everyone else. Either option losing prospect one way another. selfish. fence. Considering dominated world reason know vaccines safe ffs risk factors though - it’s well established infants sleeping blankets stomach significantly raises risk. feel like sub wants virus stick around badly, it’s going go full anti-Vaxxer. lot comments really fringe. said considered essential worker, insulting Right? even understand virus time. even test it.

""In addition, medical technology countermeasures time limited non-existent. diagnostic tests existed time could test influenza infection. fact, doctors didn’t know influenza viruses Showboating  that's crazy, sad... staff hospital feeling everything? obviously huge wave incoming already brink... must scary, know many people even stay work conditions? thank service Paging /r/conspiracy Well feel fine, much :) results coming out? I'm lose family member virus know process this. way young die. hate much. Tbf, general doctor asked again, probably ask second opinion. honestly think that, feels stupid retrospect. 

However, concern potentially giving wife covid vaccine side effects going on. Especially fever. really feel confident enough give another answer. Since (and do) fully quarantine, ""better safe sorry"" suggestion. actually Turkish scientists. Turkey saved us, Germany platform. wouldn’t affect anything long term. Considering comments made dad dick nose hanging neck gaiter guarantee masks normally. Adults fake till make young children? easy. 2 year old going spontaneously start. like they're supposed 2 year old used it, would complied.

We wear masks everywhere. wife, I, 5 year old son (4 time) since March.  also 1 year old daughter required 2. weeks ago picked one son's masks (we use temp ones) wanted put wears every time (actually associates leaving house, even car). Turns kids copy parents. Set good example. long term, kids learn that. keep trend.

When go places masks mandatory always tell plague rats kids even they're wearing correctly, kid(s) don't. could taken first claim building public faith showing it’s safe, instead. Classy move dude FlU!1 im nut seems shady CEO company refusing get vaccined, it. paper 222nm results, researchers estimate continuous exposure far-UVC light current regulatory limit would kill 90% airborne viruses 8 minutes, 95% 11 minutes, 99% 16 minutes, 99.9% 25 minutes. 

The current article researchers tested optimal wavelength killing coronavirus found length 285 nanometers (nm) almost efficient disinfecting virus wavelength 265 nm, requiring less half minute destroy 99.9% coronaviruses. result significant cost 285 nm LED bulbs much lower 265 nm bulbs, former also readily available.

Cheaper, faster, probably way skin eye hazard tho. Let's face it. got people would say believe him. live TV would say fake. thought way prove would ask kids wife top scientists get it. sitting saying trust reason searching reason believe every scientist doctor says safe. need vote statesmen, politicians. Statemen get right people place. Unfortunately, long time vaccine given kids. tested probably while. saw 60 another poll released recently (up 10 prior poll), 14 sure. Mhm. long testing it? many things testing for? Plain simple don’t enough it. same, often full no... let leave. improve average IQ US temporarily ultimately returns “things didn’t work overseas” dude get criticised takes first criticised first line haha people otherwise die die ambulances holding pattern outside hospital.

*Even if* think Covid ""just flu"", can't understand people worried slip fall broken bone *that* enough make rethink staying close home. I'd like interject moment. referring Linux, fact, GNU/Linux, I've recently taken calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux operating system unto itself, rather another free component fully functioning GNU system made useful GNU corelibs, shell utilities vital system components comprising full OS defined POSIX.

Many computer users run modified version GNU system every day, without realizing it. peculiar turn events, version GNU widely used today often called ""Linux"", many users aware basically GNU system, developed GNU Project.

There really Linux, people using it, part system use. Linux kernel: program system allocates machine's resources programs run. kernel essential part operating system, useless itself; function context complete operating system. Linux normally used combination GNU operating system: whole system basically GNU Linux added, GNU/Linux. so-called ""Linux"" distributions really distributions GNU/Linux. California? really want keep #1 spot huh? Look us Illinois better. guys start bringing cases down, fudge's sake! Restaurants absolutely run lower capacity. Flights too. private sector abolish policies pretty much immediately mandates end. ""In gesture pure altruism, want cut line.""  
\-Dr. Curtis Connors one point dude posted article Lancet making claims vaccinations reason autism rise children. time everything discredited late many people clung new belief vaccinations bad. grown worse years thanks explosion misinformation conspiracy theories internet. wanna waste time? bad flu. /s CEO shit, fuck him! Unbelievable media writes puff pieces rich assholes use taxpayer-funded R&amp;D develop drugs, jack price. Seriously, gives fuck guy. Yasss queen! Yass queen! exaggerating. wanted contrast everybody saying awful is. No, I'm impression novel virus medical community still learning three people know early 30s got it, outcomes:

1) Passed away

2) Former marathon runner lost 20 pounds getting July still cannot workout regain lost muscle mass

3) Debilitating migraines month contracting virus

These people would classified ""at risk"" vaccine prioritization timelines, none good outcomes. Obviously sample size I'm looking small, I'm going risk similar outcome vulnerable received vaccines wait mine resuming ""normalcy"".  Ofc I’m aware that’s head warp speed saying this. totally makes sense think that’s accurate time imo. mean I’m struggling think reasons otherwise all. trust science well..... trust companys government right right thing do. situation, would totally ok stepping front line running organization making vaccine. People PhDs tend morons anything outside field expertise, experience. reason becoming aggravated conversation? actually nothing post factually scientific article reputable news source. I'm pushing anything besides people getting recommendation doctor fully plan get third opinion situation light new information received. 

Yikes. want start working flies one likes pedant. Everyone two braincells rub together knows that's headline meant. “ Among explanations often put forward elderly population; social structure young often live old, exposing virus; underfunded health system; lack preparedness organisation.” It’s okay. saw here, I’m willing admit wrong proven otherwise, far saw, it’s wanted approve th vaccine 16 up, there’s information 18 up, voted no. Companies friends Yes everyone outside mostly close friends families. went back home started hanging restaurants bars etc came back vengeance. helped Tegnell co telling probably achieved level herd. immunity. wrong course tell everything want know.... wanna able go eat Mexican food love 💚 I'm anti vaxxer super concerning. guy made vaccine take want cut line bs excuse. dad wasn’t even wearing mask beginning. wearing neck gator. mask. Neck gators actually worse wearing mask you’re infected. actually accelerate transmission. Wait...the doctor worried would get fever immune response would give wife covid!? medical doctor? wonder vaccine would’ve come along without presence? Oh, right, probably Jeez life difficult sometimes big boiz spring, people stayed home government mandates. things continue get worse (they will), people going stay homes regardless government says.

The thing worse economic collapse economic collapse, countless deaths, long term covid symptoms. also tank economy. 

I absolutely agree need financial assistance everyone, without lockdowns catastrophic. officials state county level limited options that. They're can. Could hospitalizations going hospitals turning away COVID patients? remember reading states, criteria hospitalize COVID patients changed...meaning patients would hospitalized first wave, time around. sending people home oxygen tanks ride out. James harden? they've flying ""all summer""... *Fingers crossed* Interesting, would argue representative drug certification U.S. rather safety vaccine itself. Plus, FDA people reviewing vaccines. Many independent health boards, health boards countries strict drug approval methods(such Canada) already approved Pfizer vaccine.

Plus, articles harmful drugs stated tested small populations people, often less 1k. many covid vaccines already tested tens thousands people, providing better accurate information effects various groups. 

Plus, mRNA vaccines development years. technology would've used regardless, pandemic happened line used first time. 

Plus vaccine side effects show primarily first months testing, fairly rare side effects show many years later. quote Q: Circling back condensed timeline question, fair say adverse events seen Phase 3 trials—however shortened may be—we assume likely long-term negative A: Well, know adverse events happen tend cluster early on, usually within first couple months

And long term side effects also sorta get countered already take flu vaccine year. often quite quickly made new strain, long term effects known they're still given anyway low risk is. could argue they're making past flu vaccines already safe, updating slightly modifying them, argument applied covid vaccines data drawn Sars CoV 1.

Overall, they're general scientific consensus really risk. bottom life, risk getting covid far outweighs possible side effect vaccine it. Look, guy knows he's talking let's pretend he's always right take word gospel. could well wrong here. making sure aware this. Agree complacency kills. convinced complacency factor discussing world's best medicine. appreciate concerns. know guess. Sounds like Resident Evil setup lol least got something look forward lot people don’t rational viewpoint. 100% usual conspiracy theorists arms tomorrow. explain study long term side effects occur 4-8 years shorter time frame 4-8 years? I’m talking Iowa. never mask mandate. getting downvoted saying Iowa’s decline cases finally mask mandate? Wtf wrong people? anything....... least every country knows wipe USA now...... make preventable curable virus. Yeah vaccine coming summer time good clerb, fam give states incentive even slack controlling this. RE: edit. bet ass knows exactly public perception is. addition getting approved, he’s gotta sell doses. think marketing people aren’t beefing daily strategies sell doses?

Edit: inb4 “they’ve already sold hundreds millions doses”... every dose don’t sell money they’re making. know could major cash cow going want make every dollar it. fact ask /me/ anything. sorry questioning told... irrational trust vaccine point. question. People saying crazy clamour hastily developed, poorly tested vaccine employs technology abandoned dozen biotech companies safety reasons *off fucking rockers.*

...or possibly among 100k volunteer shills recruited World Economic Forum ""correct record"" COVID vaccine. think combination nicer weather summer vacation serving kind defacto lockdown. summer vacation Sweden means many people work, kids school. peak july, take vacation June August too. took work school resumed exponential growth get going again. are. Get well soon! care nobody proud that. are. JPow's printing press working overtime entire time, going straight pockets elites. What, thought they'd cause inflation actually allow benefit it?! Hi! would encourage check subreddit FAQ stickied post — may help alleviate concerns! I’m also happy answer questions vaccine :) counted covid deaths effectively happened due covid. CEO runs business side company. highly doubt putting lab time put vaccine. I'm guessing he'll wait convincing people take actually becomes priority. Right enough top priority workers happy take shot soon dose arrives. 

Taking vaccine boost people's confidence something once, makes sense keep fresh people's memories they'll actually receiving shot. UV lighting disenfecting treatment decades. tens thousands phase 3 participants vaccinated months already? enough you? issue vaccine would know now. Hi! would encourage check subreddit FAQ stickied post — may help alleviate concerns! I’m also happy answer questions vaccine :) think I'm simple minded. Assuming requirement 2 vaccine single dose strong separate it. 3 week waiting period COVID incubating period 2 weeks, possibility small still yea, could lying anyway.  believed probably already took it. Nope that's USA oligarchy controlled corporations, one percent, special interest groups decades, one bill ensured takeover Citizens United. Thanks bill, politicians receive endless amount money wealthy donors thus loyalty ends sold highest bidder. anything, COVID-19 pandemic exposed everyone real power USA. first line stimulus money wealthy corporations small businesses. Everyone else merely second thought government's mind. People may forgotten week March Wall St receiving trillion dollars day. long took government get $1200 citizens again? *Virtual hugs*  Thank nearly completely avoiding entire question asked you. lack response actually answer itself. Generally would put entrance ways disinfect people came out. said, seems like that's common way getting infected, might useful next pandemic. end banned flagrantly violating rules.

There story we've read about. think always something sane ones us acknowledged. huge difference people saying ""a 911 day worth deaths acceptable risk"" ""an annual death toll comparable flu acceptable risk."" Ahh, county police decided enforce COVID rules. Well done .... definitely line. Even USA buy enough everyone. think lower life expectancy due high infant mortality rates, though could mistaken. I.e. someone survived early childhood, decent chance making advanced age (though I'm sure decent) work done. Captain Hindsight away realize amount talking two doses hundreds millions produced. Size scale support argument anyone thinks put health line...he won’t. suurrrre Tired, worked final exam study guide, consists short answers essays. schedule stock dump first, time news release accordingly.

Moderna too. understand gesture, I’d rather got can’t used conspiracy fodder reddit hates seeing rich people make money Remember survival fittest.
It sad might lose half anti-vaccine people next year.  point willing accept level risk reward return normalcy.

Saying subreddit months ago would get downvoted accused wanting people die point. Yup, Thanksgiving infections getting sick enough checking hospital (on average) Christmas even happened, brutal newly infected people got Thanksgiving infections spreading there, checking hospital, 2 weeks later, people passed need hospital.... going good, all. January going absolutely brutal month. January, things start improve, less stupid holidays could easily skipped, folks vaccine especially risk death.  Wife traveling world

We plans head New York.. London followed trip Florence visit cousins Greece finally fly Tokyo game going Australia.

I’ve places already finally said it’s time her

Then time news.

Moderna Pfizer it. go look trades.

Totally legal, Trump's DoJ would bother prosecuting rich white people even weren't.  Seems like compared Australia? Melbourne's city 5 million people, many hundreds new cases day fixed locking hard. Dealers don’t test product let people test first lol  rich shielded diseased commoners. going criticize people facts correct, stands reason would provide source statistics use correct them. agenda? obviously conspiracy theorists, doctors scient... oh wait. put water use contrails. I'm done. country Australia 6 cases coronavirus yesterday. lmao nice joke Yea people made mistake turning martyr. There's clearly something wrong sad people continue eat lies. Yeah hit many vaccinations. Concerts sports absolutely fully online weeks after. end 21 22 funny CEO PR team probably two options:

1. say ""Look tried vaccine, safe."" doubt would cause anyone go ""Oh look CEO taking away chance healthcare workers get first!"" cuz single vaccine even state prove safe. 

2. now. claim didnt take wants others it. definitely feels like done purpose purpose could possibly solve. company worried people going worry single dose CEO takes? Surely benefit terms good PR vaccine head takes it. 

Sometimes feels like want us distrust science purpose shit like this. maybe that's point? everyone trusts science blindly, maybe something lose someone. science faults too. 2 year olds exempt wearing masks. lungs developed enough really able breath masks.

Be may, family travelling 2 year old midst pandemic raging uncontrolled. I'm saying I'm skeptical rules program. I'm skeptical good faith. are. words 43rd President ""Fool once, shame you. Fool can't get fooled again."" goalposts moving again. It’s moving covid eradication sadly guys sound paranoid Dick. easy PR guy rich fuck doesnt need go grocery shopping work resteraunt. risk basically zero will.be spending holiday family equally privliged. eait turn get month two. Oh okay makes sense thank you, still wait don’t feel need eventually get report things anonymously. fix necessarily cost job. think they'd use word ""sorry"" ever 'no shoes, shirt, vax, service' ""force""? Science hasn’t answered many cases symptoms emerging months recovery. genomic sequencing criteria accepted definition reinfection, doesn’t mean reinfection isn’t happening. It’s like saying black cats cats. Well we’ll see won’t we! Go look disturbing arrest history too. lunatic absolutely crying wolf gofundme pages. ignore basic science says children spread disease easily adults.

Scientific study: children spread half rate. 

Sure. I’m confused. Odd you’re seeking opportunities lie deflect ad hominems. Good guy CEO.....right? cases never discussion disease that’s largely asymptomatic minor. Hospitalizations deaths matters. news making stock dump collect himself? definitely testing, problem results widely available peer review, essential science. Thus, scientific community vigilant. 

Moreover, completely new vaccine technology reason decided used super important fast tracked vaccine, makes absolutely zero sense.

Vaccines super important humanity, safety process circumvented, definitely risk things going wrong. Guess test blood sure taking word.....probably okay though since big corp ceo's never lied public ever history planet. choose different job. 

I use drugs, refuse submit drug testing workplace believe violation medical privacy. take jobs demand pee. one force unless I'm direct violation law. 

There's law states must vaccinated. one proposed law. article also cites Iceland study / nat geo link. new source plenty things take issue comes numbers handling things Rebekah Jones ain't it. Yeah kids non-idiotic parents. know- Santa come house leave presents, let's go mall pandemic see him. vast majority deaths specific age groups immunocompromised, people get vaccine makes suffer severe symptoms, deaths clearly plummet flu levels below. don’t lockdown damn flu Covid 19 instead coal? website.  get point. vaccine harm anyone. shit...Alabama Louisiana aint got hospitals shit. Alabama seen 17 rural hospitals close past 12 years. know hell coming

From account, sounds like hell already here. It’s getting hotter.

I hope best please try stay healthy physically mentally. I’m expert kind please take huge grain salt understand, mRNA particular vaccine uses create immune response shouldn’t interfere fertility, general note, new mRNA vaccines appear safer regular vaccines overall. Again, expert, definitely consult doctor, know, shouldn’t issue. could like CEO believes product nope many comments people never flown 2 year old. Dude showing confidence product. Would drive ferrari owner company drove benz? How's difficult get? Also assuming people would belive would change many minds. UK, Canada, US Bahrain approved it. Dr Fauci one famous doctors pandemic said he'll take yet people going rely decision CEO never heard whether he's taken yet not? mention see people saying he's lying he'd anything sell product etc. genuinely see taking would convince others take still trust various countries approving top doctors etc saying they'll take man 80 years old. fired refusing falsify numbers. sub keep lying this?

Because reddit. literally ""whatever someone who's conservative might think okay, against"" Also amazing China shit load people better.  sorry, r/woooosh guess experience. guess used term “irrational” pretty loosely there. There’s “undecided” (which understandable) there’s “irrational”. guess could attempt convince undecided, would harder convince irrational. Endless meetings mostly. Really depends company &amp; country, Japanese CEOs involve far workers lives &amp; often live like instance. Small business owners roles like managers corporate CEOs. Here's bezos work days, video fluff tho. either/or. Ages 70+ high-risk groups 18-65 (I honestly understand 70) prioritized same. Besides, someone aged 70 might 5 years left someone 96 might well, works statistically make 90+. think point necessarily adding many years lower age groups they're already 70. Plus, 90+ higher risk, protect vulnerable society. federal government comes tries force vaccine vaccine people, won’t get good response.

Sure will. confirm. unemployed dba, getting big bucks paid crisis actor. *goes back learning lines* There's usually like 300 people plane, know keep killing 3-5 passengers... nurses still get vaccine, though. extra vaccine thrown out, going someone else instead vaccines provide tangible benefits. research, pfizer vaccine prove limit contribute limit spread carrier prospect. 

I argument vaccine provide stated read articles early neck gaiters detailed ones performed similar cloth mask. Bad PR. Every high profile figure making big deal public getting vaccine. Lmao, oh okay Ventilation mask wearing far important disinfecting objects. Keep masks windows open. Eat meals outside distanced can. inactivated virus vaccine. Uber dude DeSantis hired still charge data? Seems sus. way they'll let without vaccine. virus spreading like kind of... fire! long proteins stick around?

In cell? retty much immediately broken presented

Its processed bits MHC-I complex cell presents immune system? rest cell gets destroyed part immune chance long-term harmful effects proteins?

No, we've specifically chosen spike protein functions cell-invasion via binding ACE2-receptor. thing virus mimic part protein binds receptor cells. HIPAA nothing vaccinations. two 2 year olds here. One much larger  There's enough vaccine vaccinate 1% population. Antivaxxers would make 99% concern right now...

Not mention, CEO one would serve example trust vaccine. draw line? Yours. companies it? companies field starve death, right? cant go store etc.  

A difference without distinction. bud Pearl Mississippi sustained work injury waited 3 days went ER collapsed work (sepsis set SUPER FAST) ERs Jackson full took Meridian died ambulance right arrived. like many know back South never took Covid seriously. Three kids without dad. mainly talking countering anti-vax theories. agree said lol I'm starting think real santa. makes incredibly easy target antiVaxxers propaganda news sources feed uneducated people daily bunch friends hang party like it’s suggested people anyway. That’s kids want meet Santa usually long take tour Governor’s Mansion. MTE. expecting full normalcy least December 2021 might need masks summer. end near. They'll make new vaccine. take hours. know contact tracing? track close contacts known positives high risk situations? claim anecdotal. Stop lying dismiss evidence contrary bogus claims. 

Your Pascal’s wager perpetual flaw low-information news consumers assuming flip side zero consequences. know that’s completely wrong. Faucci, CDC, recognize lower risks contraction transmission kids recommend schools remain open. think know better? That's pretty important reason. prove grandfather American citizen, could vote early 20th century like white people too. every bit discrimination blatant ""whites only"" sign. Evolution evolution does.  Remember liberals hated big pharma?



Pepperidge farm remembers. read story earlier doctor said we’ll need 70% population vaccinated get herd immunity. also said would likely occur around late spring early summer. That’s one person’s opinion though, knows accurate is. also saw Fauci say vaccine available anyone wants April. think study deflected “claims”/ objective results found ones cited... really don’t know tell you. Probably best stop dialogue here. CEOs businessmen making business decisions. thought needed take vaccine get ppl take it, would, even 100% confident product.

Make mistake done reason, likely good PR encourage others wait line get hysterical. 

I think face problem enough vaccines ready want opposed needing convince take them. Sure nut jobs everyone else? Excellent point, friend. Thanks putting things perspective. everyone fighting vaccine right now, would chaos streets. guess anti-vaxers actually sort balancing supply demand. mean line?? sure hell is, least state. can't walk Walgreens get vaccine tomorrow.

Right mostly hospital staff getting vaccinated, since they're essential treating people get sick likely get sick themselves. Nursing homes also high list, well long list workers essential industries.

If turn get vaccinated, argument ""greater good"" failed miserably. would prefer see companies cash bonuses paid time reward employees get vaccinated. tough decision? One option could potentially save lives convinces people take vaccine otherwise wouldn't. option merely ""bad"" PR end people grumbling social media special treatment CEOs.  Please proceed. Seeing pretty fucking cold outside, beg differ. simple straightforward, can't even say apparently yup, although arguably tamest form compared federal / state employer coercion.

I think everyone get vaccinated, focusing wrath derision hesitant harden resistance. 2 tickets paradise elaborate, confirm this, believe people allergic reactions additives vaccine. think told people known, severe allergic reactions additives take vaccine. bad person. I'm depressed anxious tend catastrophize too. dunno I'd without therapist/psychiatrist. breakthrough negative mindset, even short time, becomes easier stay see world clearly rather focus negative things impair ability think critically leave horrible gut feelings clear reasons. said think legitimate concerns vaccine, know going prevent spreading people see much point... I'm lucky though work home isolate. Time tell... patient delayed coming hospital two weeks symptoms turned cancer. died hospital days later. didn’t covid, hospital system inundated help sooner. many times used brain think yourself. Stfu drunk? guy — keep bad news hidden, jump spotlight there’s good news NYC hit hard beginning, people know gotten Covid. It’s 6 months, hear that’s long enough become contagious again. Really sucks already giving people fucking Bells Palsy trials No, think important healthy individual take vaccine go immunocompromised risk person. work healthcare would give vaccine compromised person wait everyone else needed it, got it. 


He need take people getting transplants, chemo, medical condition. need first. seeing zebras horse. sound like someone believing election fraud wide spread level cause trump loose. Maybe gets worse enough week people get message we'll avoid Christmas surge. Hopefully friends hung get again? Yes. getting one, even antivax want one. one trying make people wear masks forever, absurd idea even get traction? Goal post “moving” bad way view flux situation changing.

You’ll start see thinks heading back normal summer. expect wear masks stores year. Americans won’t able get vaccine second half year don’t want go store doesn’t require masks idea really got vaccinated. Thank clarification! great information like open thread scientifically ignorant folks like myself. Hopefully help alleviate people's vague fears unknown. have, far along process Pfizer's. old news. worked federal government, required get certain vaccines allowed travel certain places government travel orders. Working hospital State Texas, expected avoid contact cancer patients recovering contagious illness. government job privilege responsibility. course required follow safety rules keep job. 

I'd certainly like see vaccination requirement in-person contract tracers, nurses doctors public hospitals, etc. Abott take it, there's issue there. THIS. Go vegan, people. Because, lot people, looks like trust safety new vaccine. grand scheme things, what's one dose compared probably tens hundreds thousands people get vaccinated? Yeah can’t see paying people full lost wages ensuring zero business’s suffer financial hardship result operating fully. Thats would take legit lockdown successful. Pay people salary promise business never suffer stay home. Groceries essential, they’d probably ban people didn’t need survive. groceries aren’t standing one place entire time. gym there’s higher chance people standing/lifting idle near someone else long period great man cronies keeps telling it’s fake pandemic. Cult behaviour usually leads lot death.  I'd rather see getting it. several dozen doses vaccinate top politicians scientists involved project boost people get vaccinated. point simple straightforward. one gets approved Jan would succeed also. J&amp;J single shot vaccine ordered 100M. Combine Pfizer Moderna that’s enough vaccines 250M Spring. Imagine 80M+ want vaccine already COVID. People bring lot. vaccines safe enough, even people, vaccines are. beta test this. LOL curve flat. coercion remains.

The comedy strong thread. We're almost Top 10. really sure due successes people's failures though. Connecticut #9 7k cases though...woof. Good luck Brexit covid. Hope least Brexit get way vaccine distribution variety reasons, can't think one. might be, can't. Shit, CIA handicap parking. I'm study, they're full dose first, initial parameters study. shit crazy college change it. conspiracy theory red bull behind ban college kids allowed get drunk energy alcohol cheap. Good point. half taking seriously might 20% infected. half taking virus seriously might 80% infected. Covid running careless people infect.  I’m pretty sure guess dad voted Yeah, lot US sites block access EU nations avoid dealing GDPR :/ Ah, great job here. Crushing this.

No vax, gummint job. Capisce? Yup. Plus theme parks.

I’m Miami live LA. Miami two weeks ago. It’s much better right government purposefully putting citizens living like California. read released today. Thank you. trust doctors scientists, don’t trust government big business. 

I’m talking micro chips Illuminati crap. I’m talking greed. can’t tell Pfizer BioNTech close vaccine hit catastrophic snag, found minute catastrophic side affect, wouldn’t put every dollar congressmen pocket toward tricking results get approved. money stake vaccine “winner”, there’s much money involved trust process. Money power power corrupts. 

Admittedly someone follows headlines occasional news science articles, I’m expert scientific approval process vaccines. I’ve read previous post still don’t fully understand it. fact I’m surprised aren’t articles main stream media discussing validity approved vaccines. would like hear multiple angles. found friends stepson died heart attack procedure indefinitely hold. Must nice option readily available decide take sure. who's say already got it? 

cant trust corpos Yeah good luck that, would never happen. Try convince place like Germany close everything thr lazy Italians ( that's states Nord look states south ) situation control. thing would countries call abandoning EU actually got super desensitized around many people time (restaurant located shopping mall). able change jobs I'm working home, go grocery store feel nervous large number people. interacting 100+ customers coworkers every day, felt normal. That's kind scary part me, also helps understand essential workers casual COVID personal lives. Don’t forget East Asia hit SARS outbreak back 2003 key lessons learnt, guess. 'no shoes, shirt, vax, service' ""coercion""? next three months trending deadlier prior. must biggest scandal since Watergate Gate Tons people already vaccine though, right? He's going first get he's trying week. That's I'm this, I'm ya. want many people need vaccine able get it, realistically can't save everyone point time. Catch 22 certain settings yes. Doctor’s office, subway, etc. - yes. fuck wearing walking around, mall, whatever. It’s comfortable miss breathing fresh air opposed breath. stares china thoughts grumpy one happily reading book enjoying liberty people nurses came forced join satan party everyone else. Depends wording contract. might argument failing immunize endangers patients poses medical ethics problem retaining employee. Time relight house Florida bars, nightclubs, restaurants, concerts open. Meanwhile, CA super high cases businesses closed since Spring. government could provide financial assistance could pull shit together enough actually enforce lockdown. cost money, won’t. could wrong, predict nothing change vaccination eventually everything go back normal even deaths forgotten.

I welcome government prove wrong. Catch 22 Yes? anti-science patriots still refuse everyone else vaccinated, going spend time needed every one them?

Of course will. reading mRNA vaccines. That’s condescending, genuinely encourage it. technology around. It’s matter programming develop antibodies target specific part virus, case spike protein. It’s faster process typical inactive virus technology, it’s trying trigger immune response entire virus, one part.

I understand hesitancy, can’t apply previous vaccine timelines it’s different technology that. Also we’ve literally never level technology available us right now, many scientists much money pointed one thing. Dorthy Mantooth saint! Darwin Awards. Unfortunately always innocent bear brunt :(. [\*Sovereign Immunity entered left-wing comment? Damn control feelings, bro.  Agreed 100%. People downvote doesn’t fit narrative need shutdown safe. Unfortunately us, mere mortals. That’s read comment well. Nurses right hospitals. care sick peole... GASP ... take certain common sense precautions! Nobody earth would complained head company producing first vaccine global pandemic took vaccine insure safety.

I fucking would. global elite already get everything else- think people like able get vaccinated first too?

30k people already gotten vaccine _one_ suddenly prove safe? many labs in, doctor? I'm willing guess salary never even seen lab TV. Stfu. Isn’t likelihood higher someone 96 hospital without vaccine? would think, open wrong given different perspective, give vaccines someone younger (40-60, maybe even 70). 96 year old still hospital, vaccine could stop someone younger joining them, thus reducing beds. know embarrassed, hope understand point. 

Jobs rights, privileges. ginny pig? Getting “vaccinated live” pointless opinion. could literally anything nothing “vaccine” “taking live”. Total publicity stunt definitely understand people want get health care experience. Whether people realize Covid going leave lasting impression anyone lived it, there's going unforseen consequences long 😔 ?????? I'm sorry no. Language hard. multiple options, context matters determining definition. guess what, comes setting context, speaker charge, you.


Here's another Cambridge: ""someone works company organization powerful position:""

""Not good look dude"" thing good look here. Bullshit.... got day 1 gaurenfuckenteed Fun fact, agriculture waaaaaaaaaay worse environment. Wanna save it, eat less meat could get shot live TV, taken random random batch people would still believe placebo obviously want get microchipped blah blah blah.

People trust process wait. really want sure long term effects wait least year. let rest us get vaccinated sooner I'm ok with. sound like getting flu shot side effects terrible. Hypochondria run family?  seems last minute hasty. hand, taking measures sooner lowers public acceptance - delicate balancing act. won’t even possibility like 8 months lol. dumb even bring Definitely, I’m using point. Like even excuse millions people die Yeah, right... quick look guy's comments history make understand REAL quick he's uneducated piece garbage. Move along, folks! It’s cool, though. don’t enough medical personnel staff hospitals, indoor dining, bars movie theaters still open. even come COVID suffer running ICU beds. people going die car crashes, heart attacks, everything kind emergency. facetious?
 
Incase not... absolutely no. 
 
You know airplanes, masks descend, tell secure mask *before* assisting others theirs? concept here. make sure protecting us (in case med frontline workers work backwards there) first. ensures people end day still alive. sure applies everything def applies Shady management normal. Lmao especially since comments reasonable upvoted excellent question. well fitting mask absolutely pleasant wear one tight loose. True adults children. Los Angeles million people run beds “anti-vaccine” person. BUT, guy saying doesn’t want “cut line” says, doesn’t want take it, sees results... heard pretty gnarly side effects. honest. opinion. would ultimate hubris vaccinate fans teams Super Bowl thousands still dying every day. Month long lockdowns slow spread enough make controllable. Australia's experience lock three months get point contact tracing effective. mass congregate places like church Walmart year round. Fake news. Sinterklaas, Kerstman! Blue = Dead first wasn’t case here. emergency would force two year old plane? NOBODY would angry took it

blanket statements like true, someone find way complain I'm taking CEO takes woman found dead.

Brilliant Brandy Vaughan former sales rep Merck explains vaccination vs profit son age (5 now, 4 earlier) complete meltdown store once, forgot mask (even though mandated time). Fortunately jimmied adult mask work him, yeah, kids really like copy parents. never issues wearing masks. 2 year old daughter (was 1 earlier) always wanted mask well, tell so. notice limit 15-20 minutes wearing take off. usually go places 

I go flight anyway, knowing daughter wear mask long I'd know couldn't.

So anytime see kid wearing mask absolutely assume that's lesson they've taught parents. Nope. wasn’t huge emergency get plane. flying fun weekend family friends. They’ve flying summer! 

If two year old won’t wear mask, stay fuck home. right flying country fun people dying behavior. It’s like half country consists toddlers adult clothes. go. fact, anybody awe regarding achievement ignorant entitled piece shit.

How people type upvote garbage like this? Get lol think misleading. leave America.

If someone serves armed forces enter country fought put life line, really consider veteran war. Imagine calling one's self veteran Iraq Vietnam never left America.... Good thank  believe that. IMA ICU staffed ICU. Almost 200 upvotes this, sad. trust 30,000 people thing weird argument skepticism. Presumably falsified / covered / minimized something maybe know facts trials drug outside CEO guy probably knows went on.

His taking shot proves trusts numbers meaning public trust face value.

I’ve seen corporations lot shady stuff, there’s reason tech companies make people use software. took it, people would say unfair rich getting higher priority first night back bar without rules going lit. idea talking Let preface i'm going get vaccine regardless does. labeling ""celebrity"" dishonest argument. He's celebrity. He's CEO company made vaccine telling country safe vaccine. 

Why think getting approved government means 100% fine anyway? faith government gone significantly last 4 years. sub anti vaxx now? Damn twist. source good, forgot add word ""some"" sentence source exaggerate point.

I'm saying agree person replied to. think everyone take vaccine. carrier infect others.

'COVID-19 symptoms sometimes persist months. virus damage lungs, heart brain, increases risk long-term health problems.

Most people coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within weeks. people — even mild versions disease — continue experience symptoms initial recovery.' need move manufacturing China. Well, mean, 40,000 test subjects - one done CEO? city Los Angeles 7000 today world think CEOs massive pharma companies easily replaced? It’s even conspiracy.... it’s common sense. I’m getting vaccinated happily turn comes 6 months so. 

I would absolutely first wave. Gonna see shakes Guinea pig peers first.￼ Plus 100x easier roll Lots relationship breakups divorces.a lot relationships built certain patterns routines, forcing together long without everything else little unfair, plus stress. 

Of course worst study fear one day going hearing shutdown impacted children. Abused children normally school, mandatory reporters, friends. affected gen post-zoomers social skills, academics, experience. might end family oriented, health conscience maybe comfortable isolation/solitude. 

Historians sociologists going hands full next 30 years. Stop shifting blame, time retarded misinformed people, don’t trust vaccine die care, people need want get asap took fucking vaccine tells everyone didn’t get it. seems likely. Get net, 12 days lazy bones. sorry uneducated easy literally throw links damn uninformed. 

Let ask this, government money paid, *to you*, socialism, is? I'll wait 12 days harness enough brain power write sentence. think might trust vaccine distributed hundreds millions (if billions) people. something wrong it, company business. reason make gamble, even profitable drug. risk assessment would low. People like going lead longer lasting lockdowns longer timeframe reach Herd immunity. chained railed vampire grave 5 mins house real. hospitals world run beds. COVID patients caused cancer treatments operations delayed. beds free make difference there. Pocket sand!

^sh ^sh ^shaa Irrational people like half thread? nether Orange County, Los Angeles run well fLu, hOax!!!! everyone chooses live. chose mississippi want move, guaranteed means move. Especially given amount unemployment financial hardship increased pandemic

I'm Mississippi, way  much enough data. many 55's big issue study biological processes determine generate immune response. Many vaccines limited 55 data approved anyway reasons. like, *totally* good this. 

Sure patriots could grifted...erm...convinced send even money ostensible legal challenges - trend right now. I'm extra cautious like you, parents family members myself. parents get vaccine, yeah I'll taking risks. 

You mentioned grocery stores maskless people. stores around offer curbside pickup? grocery store since March, hell count number times I've building house one hand. vulnerable people life vaccinated, I'm gonna stop caring seeing people without masks  man

He good *thing.* I'd hard time saying CEO Pfizer good man. Ofc try monkeys first.. action brought soft anti vaccine people out, bit scary. right, took it, people would complain rich jumping line. good look Show conflicting evidence. mayoclinic reliable source? use fox news sources? hope average person want wear mask. I'm still waiting average person neck woods start wearing damn thing. He's saying takes vaccine people accuse taking people truely need i.e: frontline healthcare workers risk. I'm sure already accounts parler donald.win idea point trying make talking right now. total. California nearly 60% cases assertion wrong laughable. 

Deaths indeed close, virus largely kills elderly, surprise given Florida’s elderly skewing population.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* funny thing seeing anti vaccine people sides spectrum. COVID hoax people. look around subreddit see people want lockdowns skeptical vaccine. Look trainwreck thread Pfizer CEO jumping line vaccine suddenly much Reddit skeptical. *they are* noble. Remind again, guy makes 90 million dollars per month compensation package bit ""modest"" that? worry, sophomore year extra crazy pent demand college parties. ""Welcome week""? Make welcome month welcome year!

I hope get college soon safely possible CEO takes rest executives also want take it. example wealthy skipping line.

If literally every *actual expert* telling safe every living President former President well world leaders taking convince nothing will.

One CEO going change mind.  Bullshit.

Why people naive?

There's reason want take it, he's healthy 59 year old want skip queue. Nursing isn’t hard field get CA earliest, widely accepted mask rules cases exploding.. said *some* places cases going evidently consider social security, Medicare, medicaid, food stamps, birth assistance programs, k-12 education, roads, fire fighters socialism. 

Of course don't, I'm idiot. stare headline trying come terms fact world gotten shitty corporation attorney general.....the truth large enough company ignore one even horrific.  That's good hear. trying follow rules. think worry people different households still gather socialize, without outdoor options due cold weather, gathering indoors.  ""previously set goal"" actually ""set"" CEO 8/19. stock ""reached"" said ""goal"" next day, 8/20, announced vaccine. drove playground (precovid) found taken shoes socks off. fought hard tried put back left without ever letting car. can't force wear masks, rarely go inside stores. said skipping it, dont put words mouth nearsighted gynecologist  Without form upper management scientist made come together kindness hearts.

It amazes people can't something simple like wear damn mask. inconvenience you? wear forever, terrible? He's see doctors send cops round up. today. suspect code driver's license official ID, code insurance card. separate card ____ interim ID issuance. said reason trust vaccine.

“GeT lOoK ANti VAXXeR!!!” tell people different vaccine tell I’m anti Vaxxer they’re literally changing dna 🧬 structure keep “safe” virus !??? take vaccine? rocket science. Ask stupid question get stupid answers, haha Maybe beta all, waiting stable release.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 95% immunity rate, either exposure virus, vaccination get us place effectively back normal virus longer hosts infect. 

60%ish immunity start bend curv infection pretty drastically. 

Some degree restrictions gonna us while. Stuff like Night clubs may thing till way wayyy late next year early 2022. quick get back normal depends many folks actually want get vaccinated. Last checked like 63% folks enough start pushing virus big time(we got lucky 95% effective). Itll inteeesting see fast vaccinate 150million+ people. Yeah people literally read 1000s articles explaining timeframe human trials changed, steps get there. reality vaccines amount testing humans other. probably risky trial participants. People really need dis-abused entitlement fly around world whim. unvaccinated medical workers just... potentially infect others? Yeah, know that, spike protein same, assume vaccine work 99% confidence, would guess. Also, lockdowns may contributing factor. People sedentary, sleeping poorly, eating healthily. personally, I've sedentary unhealthy overall since beginning pandemic. used go gym 3-4 days week, barely exercise. days I'll walk maybe 100 steps whole day. seriously thought going say someone showed parent/teacher conference sans pants... He's also risk management committee. Sure, educated assumption based many people power/wealth demonstrated throughout last year person made dies, who's gonna left fix faulty vaccine? kept mouth shut. add fuel hatred anti vaxxers. Except internal information available. *If* concern R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution, storage, supply chain, etc. Group knows it. (probably irrational) worry going reduce adoption rates even among front line.

It's probably, hopefully, fine. statement exact opposite inspire confidence people understand important keep hospital capacity open? many people get hospitalized covid. happen cold flu. remember single flu season famous people politicians hospitalized within weeks months other. Sunmer definitely helped brought spread faster decline, first wave peaked back mid April steady decline since then.   Elective mean optional. means emergency, get choose it. showing confident vaccine would far influential bullshit PR one believes

Please speak yourself. ozzy's already immune one bat Turkey really lax lockdown, least report true numbers now. CEO trust vaccine enough take expects others take it? Yea seem shady all. Thats reason. killing christmas, /s!&lt; Truuu  Ah, old attack someone’s comment history instead actual content post. think says ability effectively debate. you’re going assume that? adding point. don’t think wasteful right term considering someone influence, knowledge, experience I’m sure help keep people alive. life value even helping ensure lives potentially cost someone else probably prevent deaths overall long run. Also it’s important take people don’t even bullshit arguments “even Fauci won’t take vaccine”.

At end day everyone risk die this. Less you’re younger looking big picture, support younger Fauci getting vaccinated still holds up.

This strange hypothetical. sounds like interesting work! I've reading stuff biomeds others work area. timelines actually reasonable usually paperwork balloons figure, rounds testing.

Consider circumstances vaccine companies well. produce anything issues going get legally financially reamed considering many people countries going using product. think they'd want take risk. probably safer vaccines it, that's assumption. Indeed. great job revealing fail preventing arresting systemic problems. least UK, pharma companies employees considered essential, me, guy, yes CEO would considered essential worker No, clinical trial participants guinea pigs. woman early recipient speedily approved vaccine. Even drug developed 10 years, may still adverse events. Nothing perfect world. would completely trivial go TV segment inject placebo vitamins instead vaccine. believe second somehow proves vaccine safe- good lord idea even say that. looneys assume whatever shot gets placebo take lot people convinced good.

If one guy getting shot could easily faked PR purposes convinces you- multiple clinical trials tens thousands participants not- put end line get vaccine either unbelievably naive, unbelievably stupid. Ya probably. That's downvote buttons for

Great. Glad that's settled

Ya fair fair. Let ED pills first worey vaccine. 

I'd trust local station fox cnn

I'm sure people stabbed killed ps5 now. mean ya really like that. Cases dropped around 10k daily cases whole point studies verify well known chemicals safe effective. Seriously, [you look ingredients Pfizer that's takes feel safe it. people would blame privileged. China done drone strike foreign person, mistaking US. I've dream whole life still come true. Definitely meant human consumption lol Hey, random note say thank taking time read reply guy, exchange important read me, I’m sure many silent redditors. didn’t stick out, did, thanks. Let's see many kids get it. 5 mins less exposure, masks. Yea often it’s lose lose situation stuff like this. gets it’s “oh get granny joe” doesn’t “oh it’s unsafe doesn’t want it” 

Besides people would think it’s unsafe doesn’t “cut line” would say took fake vaccine anyways wouldn’t sway lol expect non essential staff stay fuck away manufacturing area. put chemicals body every day, everyone does. Many chemicals tested much vaccines have, thalidomide certainly tested much 60 years ago (the terrible birth defects caused thalidomide led development greater drug regulation monitoring many countries) used bad methods testing TGN1412 - MHRA approved two-hour protocol, drug administered participants within twenty minutes. friend nursing school said baffled many people ridiculously stupid there. standard getting nursing school (according her) high (she originally premed, couldn’t get in). Another friend mine doctor says nursing curriculum ridiculously easy. Hardened sceptics believe taking real thing anyway. also lost big toe left foot. nurse friend lying you. 

You can't let patients die they're room right next ICU. ""Welp, try ICU, sorry"" - works. *Straight* jail anybody tried pull shit. Natural selection baby Fck knows something don't..... need convince anyone though?

His job manage executive level decisions made pharmaceutical company.

Nothing job description includes convincing people take vaccine. first priority keep manufacturing ensure regulatory requirements met.  Yes, many people went trials, thinking whole time, ""Heroes"". behind-the-scenes people risking lives rest us. remember wishing could contribute society way doing. celebrate get vaccinated. bet I'll get comments ""they got paid."" WOULD GLADLY PAY get vaccine. AstraZeneca doses already produced too, said press release would 150m dosed end year. 40% nurses 10% doctors large hospital network friend works said wouldn’t take COVID vaccine if/when given choice going keep downvoting disagree let know stop Go it. might. We'll see. plan taking point, now. 

Good- wait long want. Like said- want sure long term effects wait least Probably fact every night local news keep talking fda whatever fast tracking get sooner.

You even fucking know fast tracking means you?

The FDA gets thousands studies, proposals, clinical trial data review time. Fast tracking mean ignore data. means look data vaccine candidates look data newest penis pills because, guess what! Covid bigger threat ED.

That's fucking means fast track drug. mean skipping safety steps otherwise ramming drug throat.

Or think FDA simply ignored data vaccine candidates processed months penis pill data submitted local news saying it, cnn fox whatever

Because local stations renowned large investigative journalism again, go it. really mind waiting, I'll wait long need to. 

And again- want sure long term effects wait least I'm also waiting awhile buying ps5 get day-one bugs get good supply chain going I'm stressing trying get one. vaccine too?

Because one dying PS5. Seriously- that's best fucking comparison could come with? 3k people dying every day US alone- hey- that's like waiting buy PS5! chef taste test new recipe create? None, vaccine passport US Yes start flying keep job! even you? Stfu. people able confirm taken vaccine. get vaccinated, assasins sent kill make look like died vaccine. Maybe 10% can't vaccinated 30% already got knows far more, he's getting reports carefully checked cleared public release. Internal documents almost always messier detailed release, highly doubt medical company exception I'm paramedic I'd say like 60% coworkers taking wait‐and‐see approach, 20% take immediately, 20% take all.

If scientists even execs BioNTech saying point.  reverse. Covid shut work made company remote permanently March. trying get gig campus around many people possible soon get magic juice injected veins. introvert. matter want lots human contact 2021. trust science, yes. trust men trying sell science. Sorry say wrote much still missed point:

The EMA approved yet. road block now, individual countries. hope shioments Belgian Pfizer plant go Europe great helped UK US well lol yeah right. Nobody kind integrity. Especially pharma CEO. 

He's either: A) busy shit/lazy swipe dose assembly line, B) already took dose straight lying optics, C) vaccine unsafe knows it. That's even remotely true. tiny isolated Island significantly larger seem realise. UK tiny island side planet me...And economy pretty fucking significant people live here. borders shut visitors trade still alive well , infact seems quite boom economy people staying home spending home.

The 4 million tourists tourists. NZ 20 + million arrivals airports normal years. would thought people travel various reasons locals also arrive depart well. 

But right hard lockdown, keeping borders shut allowed us continue normal lifes since April. right wrong reasons stated. Well different CEO company wanna take makes seems like secretly knows issues something. all, access information vaccine fauci presidents have. saying true, wanna get shot asap, looks like outsider. He’s CEO company producing vaccine. executive board also declined take vaccine. important people vaccination project. Surrrrreeeee
That's reason wanna take thinking same. Maybe left something out. Like 60% July something like So... I'm reading is... Eat whole bunch LEDs... read article, thanks, interested stopped testing highest dose vaccine trial number reports severe adverse reactions. 

To me, goes counter point second injection also supposed quite unpleasant many people.

I think ""was supposed be..."". Anyone who's critical virus think ceo lying. would say, ""trust conclusions made doctors given current body research evidence""

Because ""science"" magical God appears sky makes decrees. Fuck scares me. may covid cousin it.  I'm outside US, people skeptical vaccine point get it, walk public medical centre get it. Haha says 😂 trust Science 🧫 🧪 it’s ongoing thing. truth today could tomorrow’s lies. really wanna see COVID-19 burried done fast enough tests variables done much pressure expectations public prevent panic satisfy politicians investors public? trust science hasty one surprised given spreads chance mutation occur. Oh got confused. thought person arguing with. Eh honestly I'm tired mess someone else probably best bow ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ tiny saying CEO getting saline compared CEO confirming get vaccine world's difference. Maybe, insider trading everyone else market knowledge make trade. overly sensitive opposite vitrue impossible disprove viewpoint conspiracy theorists. They'll say injected something else rather COVID vaccine. could even 10 conspiracy theorists show get vaccinated give random vaccine, broadcast they'll say they're crisis actors deep state agents. many people around still aren’t wearing masks wearing correctly. Air ducts vents get real dusty short amount time. going need cleaned regularly otherwise LEDs lose effectiveness. dont care either way. Im getting thursday nowhere say get it. Well, dont work, there's always porn them. mean, fair wait see, no? That's outright refusal, healthy skepticism. key thing successful nations reason successful made plan execute well. governments even step 1. Repeated short term lockdowns screeching people ""wear mask granny killer"" plan. hiding table hoping gone away come out. also know long vaccines work. much likely: He’s lying doesn’t come elite person pandemic. Probably entire board families offered vaccine already. Finally class accept evidence vaccine safe effective""

And hence wait reliable evidence gathered. could finally make cure common cold. Haven’t heard anything since November 4 Aw missed word. meant say can. important understand much politics* goes determining considered ""expert"" academia various institutions. particular, people elevated public-facing positions (the people hear from) likely much skilled politics skilled field. understand know imagine before, true long time.

This expertise considered weighed, deified treated infallible. Someone necessarily right honest considered expert. Refusing acknowledge fact (""Just trust scientists; know better you!"") part dynamic fuels reactionary delusional thinking/behavior among noticeable swaths population.

*To clear, ""politics"" refers understanding interpersonal relationships, power dynamics, taking advantage structure institutions gain power prestige. Sad Give god-damn break mail bitches everybody already. job still important. steer company direction want go. CEO wanted develop Covid vaccine have. UK took first place us, give fought get back. we're opening Christmas, intend keep time. That's mistake IMHO, even risk group, little fact discourage another couple % people get one soon. vaccinated one first people, ot would solid argument doubters. I'm actually surprised employees Pfizer, companies making vaccine, required get vaccine. mean, especially researchers literally working samples virus daily, vaccinated everything possibly it’s issue favouritism cutting line, using position get vaccine others. can’t win situation. dweeb? Australia discontinue vaccine started giving people false positives HIV silly, that's standard protocol keep dear important leader functioning 140%! I'm confused- discussing vaccines developed whether might rushed arguing sake arguing? former, what's problem trying clarify meant previous post? latter, want someone argue with, I'll happily bow out. First headline sub reads like r/conspiracy fuck talk host shes sharon fking osbourne mate shouldve held election people vote! Fauci optimist. not. fear-mongering vaccine barely started. Early winter best. black people, also white people simply us. No, could say did. Like light inside body? want help too. take it, show safe doubters. Lmao WTF exactly started response persons post maybe escape enforced vaccine considering side effects efficacy really much claimed. Ahah, course want it, knows tested. late April May/June still estimate earliest vaccination date regular adults (non-essential worker, non-high risk condition)? 2.5-3.4 1  So...Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla taking vaccine order “cut line”? Sounds like bunch BS me...

I’m claiming vaccine faulty. However, believe show confidence WHATEVER product may be.

What seems beneficial? Saving one freaking dose needed get vaccinated (while company produces millions weekly), taking vaccine (maybe even camera) produce confidence people scared vaccine? 40% Americans vaccine (for whatever reasons), maybe instead trying big pharma “nice guy” CEO, show world you’re confident product &amp; administered yourself?! Victoria (Melbourne) learn contact tracing efficiently thats fairly recent. NSW (Sydney) long best contact tracers busting balls since March Ruby debacle, keeping us safe. never got control remainng states. 1 state make country. read would get would. company shown/seen taking would increase trust vaccine. sucks. worked school system speech general special ed years idea. Oh, finally noble pharmaceutical company. 🤨 another case  Lacks  cervical cancer medical community used cells (taken biopsy) medical research. done without consent family didn’t find 1975.

That 1951. asked even white. standards day, would asked biopsy could done, doctors/scientists would whatever wanted considered medical waste. main problem protect privacy, name associated cell line. advent genome sequencing, DNA sequence became public information affected privacy relatives. One what? Skeptical person? them. lot more. surprises there. Lmao getting information reddit comment retarded af. Honestly getting vaccine months, easy upset dumb bit

Night 😘 Im anti vaxxer. plan take soon Im able to... Wtf about? virus common cold, shit. ever vaccinated anyone common fucking cold? That's nonsensical assumption. he's willing lie safety, would honest taking it? could due relaxed measures south east London, there’s higher transmission rates new strain potentially infectious old one?

We don’t actually know. parent refused tike ffs I'm taking vaccine first months.

No- actually spreading misinformation making baseless claims like ""the vaccine rushed"". 0 evidence support claim refused provide evidence. also understand basic terminology like fast tracking means trying use convince people vaccine might safe. Like said- ignorant what's worse seem proud it.

Either way- stopped entertaining good night. It’s really well contained. don’t test people much countries. days surging number cases too. WOW kid got 😂😂👀

I'm sure fine. low incidences society normal, let alone social distancing. saw flu. reason mum got rubella coworker told did. horrified. right things little one lucky :) hope slaps anxiety bit! know going downvoted hell please provide hard data indicates 3-4/10 people take vaccine end get otherwise thing herd immunity.

However, things start become normal vaccinated covid still around affecting wont cant get vaccine mostly political organization. I'm reminded motto Royal Society (the founding fathers scientific method), ""Nullius verba"" - ""Take nobody's word it"".

Science works even trust - ""I trust science"" meaningless ""I trust gravity"". ""I trust scientists"" would much better.  That's baseless assumption. Wait...did go previous comme reignite argument? Pfizer didn’t create it, distributor. created Biontech 100% agree. ""Cough Cough... Um... Line?""

*"" 'Cough!' Idiot""*

""Oh yeah!"" Wow, that’s really progressive genius man time, yet alone monarch. Ya whatever wrobg words used.

Ok- specifically mentioned local news. I'm sure mention FDA fast tracking vaccine candidates are, evidence vaccines rushed? I'm aware evidence please post would love review it.

The Pfizer vaccine based research they've ten years that's hardly rushed. Pfizer Moderna vaccines undergone three stages clinical trials tens thousands participants rushed either. They've parallelized testing eliminate delays- that's rushing 100% effective

No vaccine ever 100% effective that's waiting waiting forever. Pfizer Moderna vaccines 94% effective actually incredibly high terms vaccine worth getting yet

The vaccines going get effective ask- waiting get you? vaccine candidates like Astra Zeneca vaccine actually less effective either Pfizer Moderna vaccines waiting get anything either. Taking story. taking is. Bad pr move. Take shot.  also want cut line comes wages makes sure everyone else company got bonus him? Nothing mRNA vaccines interacts DNA. mRNA surrounded lipid enclosure. lipid enclosure fuses cell membranes releases mRNA cytoplasm cell. ribosomes make proteins mRNA located cytoplasm. What?

Thousands people problem publicly laughing news story. America big trouble.  telling chose remain risk wants one average Joe get place. 

If taken vaccine, could play “I tested too. stand vaccine 100%” 

Instead, believe CEO amazing altruistic person, unlike anyone C-suite Fortune 500 company, turned protection pandemic virus. Yeah, okay. conceived pandemic chouce? are, time Tegnell FHM beeing completely unwilling recommend real sanctions breaching restrictions going legislative route locking hurtful right now. Region Gävleborg go disaster mode today. region Stockholm non acute operations children postponed. Yes infections go lockdown, health care system brink right now. data? I'm making claim. MOM! MEATLOAF! ...FUCK! americans lmao local police OC cities

There bunch cities contract law enforcement county sheriff, bit exaggeration. half cities count far half population PDs. Previously, rapid development new vaccine mumps, took four years; require decade. speed development testing Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine name project, Operation Warp Speed, created concern among worry whether really know vaccines safe effective quickly. Wow nurse trusting science? Who’d thought ?? get tested everyday players positive can’t play meet certain return criteria. Ah right, understand line reasoning. disagree though. Pharmaceutical industry quite different industries, much less reasons believe recent success Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also contribute future successes several reasons:

1. Pharmaceutical products high risk development high costs related bringing product market (think billions) completely result dead-end final stage due unforeseeable factors medical/biological originating differences people. Therefore successful pre-clinical tests often turn dud. extra money going prevent happening.
2. revolutionary product Pfizer/BioNTech bring vaccine field/market, ones. science behind difficult patent Moderna/NIH already near identical solution (i.e. mRNA). Making things complicated vaccine strategies Oxford/AstraZeneca Janssen (adenoviral based). major advantage: better scalability present infrastructure bioreactors, better stability (lower cooling temperatures needed), single injection. short, competition terrible.
3. recent stock prices largely inflated due people/investors really encompassing reasons 1 2, induced hyper-optimistic hopeful view vaccine symbolises (and first bring results major contributor this). end pandemic viewed one-off unrealistic 'bet' future pandemic. 

The CEO clearly knew this, definitely sort insider information. Anyone level-headed aware way Pharmaceutical industry work saw coming. end, breakthrough vaccines viewed sort temporary bonus thanks external factors, internal. line? Lmfao fuck talking about? get from? 100% line places, old people, healthcare workers, first responders, etc. 

No clue getting upvoted first fabrication. Oh god. read comment, occurred could negative way portray story.

Wow. course. Governor DeathSentence entered chat. may shed virus vaccination. would parents toddlers get vaccinated without infecting them? Ever tried raising two toddlers social distance possible!

My wife would first line, I'm worried sons getting it. I'd probably survive gave kids covid died. That’s good point too. Sorry included: countries exponential growth stopped, France Germany those. science clear 14 day isolation way go, countries covid managed 14 day system. obviously work incredibly hard towards goal taken away. Sorry people stuff worked cared about, live like would regardless pandemic. 59 years old well within at-risk groups developing serious symptoms (what vaccine designed significantly reduce).

He's 20 odd years young risk groups know he’s high risk job?

He pretty open front line worker. He's business company developing vaccine fights virus. could one two people removed trialling vaccine (all virus).

Business execs far away test subjects. likely emailed ppt someone manages team people managed part trials.

He leader BioTherapeutics Research &amp; Development Group would given info middle manager etc shouldn’t given choice. that, mean told “take vaccine find somewhere else work” Maybe knows something... anything? We've seen everyone Basketball players politicians getting *daily* testing deaths door get one earlier year. top food chain unless hopelessly naïve believe otherwise, takes full advantage fact. idea selflessly turning company's vaccine good humanity absurd. He's CEO huge Pharma company, godssake, people saints. true reason. He's CEO major multinational making bank second biggest crisis year. I'm sure he'll crying millions dollars luxury apartment sky. can't wait locked places vaccinated. good day care now? *""Suppose hit body tremendous, whether ultraviolet powerful light, think said hasn’t checked you’re going test — said suppose brought light inside body, either skin way. think said you’re going test that, too.

An elected upper management would actualy worker interests mind, instead shareholders‘. really good reason nowadays. Cool! That's reasonable (even though Italians ready means) Exactly. able watch another Hollywood movie America saves world end, without cringing out. one hand no-win people claim elites getting others will, like (and frankly, me) think drop water worth confidence.

But even beyond said another comment really irrelevant next months, supply's gonna take ages match demand be? believe world's actions year necessitates olympics? offense, get back workbench start next looming problems covid, namely climate change already here. spoke absolute fact.

It OK one person make thousands dollars day literally sit nothing rest world suffers. Period.

Did say people evil? No.

Did say dont deserve good pay recognition? No.

But advocating better world majority people suffering? EVERYONE roof head safe place, healthy food, clean water, free education, free health care, free better mental health care, ability travel world freely planet? Absolutely.

The time 99% us working next nothing over.

Get get left behind.

Again, wake fuck up.

I proved anything yours.

You bitched preteens idiots.

I'm showing close minded idiot needs realize adults line way thinking.

You're done. Germans desperate.

The UK US started race bottom. Trump even threatened fire head FDA approve vaccine immediately. competition among regulatory agency approve vaccine fastest undermine vaccine safety. oh dear hope vaccines good.

anti-vaccines also spreading China years, anything bad happened covid vaccine...it would impactful hit people's trust towards vaccine. matter US made vaccine China made vaccine, even vaccine covid...

please screw up, fucking boat now... people actually think coronavirus vaccine developed fuck specific demographic people? would work, would convince anyone believed true? I’m bit hard hearing. normal times get by, masks everything muffled, can’t look lips see what’s said. absolute hell surprising me, city there’s “Santa” home visits kids get see Santa. see groups Facebook, guy says tested negative COVID he’ll wear mask times. safe really be, especially kids don’t wear masks “Santa” goes homes same? pr stunt. people he's probably least likely get covid Availability limited means number people take going change. small percentage people receive soon regardless says.

As long he's taken vaccines easer get, issue all. America country recommending less 14 day quarantine

Wildly incorrect [this enough proof otherwise

If want go ahead argue Canada's recommendations best welcome going outright give false information then...don't surprised posts removed misinformation got kids house taken away too. No? joke, Italy literally happening (or least, that's heard). They're saying vaccine different want virus made state kill antivaxxers, they'll ""show smarter"" Actually money grafted outside public eye much effectively easier. Unless banana republic sorts becoming politician money sign stupidity. Self delusion much bigger motivator. lust power. interest attention. cut deal Trump license name.

He gets dollar every dose vaccine licensed name taken. Insane people get targeted vaccine, makes buck. Wow generous rich person doesn’t get vaccine buts still hoards wealth causing global suffering! think entire strategy hold tight hoping vaccines arrive. Ohhhh....this guy greek? definitely bullshitting ( greek too) many folks know information assume everyone get it. fact can. enough information seems like plowed ""VACCINE HERE"" without additional information. also means lot people less likely take it

Availability limited means number people going change all. did, don’t even know it. Makes perfect sense actually. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

After all, needed 10 days separate placebo vaccinated.  “It well attended public officials believe speak majority saying still stand decision Chamber move forward holiday traditions, bring sense normalcy trying times,” Parker wrote Facebook post, doesn’t mention whether attendees Claus characters wearing masks.

Let take wild fucking guess whether wearing masks not.  No...I really didn't.

I'm 33.

Idiot. Thank thoroughly proving point even more. know even find page report shit. would accuse using privilege getting front people need urgently. Nah, f that. think trust better placed sketchy politicians finding speaking points fit world view hopes cast ballot entitling whatever highest bidder wants 4 years. Ubereats grub hub? Repeat wrote 5 times 

If doesn’t sound absolutely pathetic, cowardly stupid might mental disability Looks like Santa going super spreader list course, 1% immunity reduce spread 1%, 15% 15% etc.

The threshold becomes less 1 person. Refusing vaccine means someone else chance it.

It also means lot people less likely take it, CEO company trust vaccine. work Fortune 100 company; I'm even remotely convinced turning vaccine someone else could get place. live world Patrick Batemans, moral people last long leadership positions companies. Don’t know you’re downvoted. small impact first, people get vaccinated impact expand. Seeing China got caught agents every major western company government think made shit list sure can’t go regular doctor like corner CVS get vaccine. people ahead getting first. 

there line. Probably related Europe close friend today doctor started medical career nursing school dropped claiming education got regarding medicine basic focus social questions, properly comfort sad relative, speak make someone worry mince words way patient would feel good possible.

His views classmates brightest either reminded much social care work anything related medicine. possible start transition medicine years really jaded Exactly! pointless (or even counterproductive) implement measures, wont backed population cause major civil unrest.

In germany needed shit go beginning fall, otherwise could implemented lockdowns currently have. Im saying best scenario (in fact shitty worked rules imo) without spike cases, ""trust"" pandemic would loosen loosen.

Its prevention paradox, way is. need wake fact fucking ridiculous one person makes thousands dollars day sitting work half day 99% world barely survive.

Pre-teen idiots?

Wake fuck up. people work 2-3 jobs keep roof head food table.

This. Is. Not. Ok.

Period.

And CEOs essential workers.

Essential workers health care / medical / social / mental health field.

Wake fuck get head asses literally give two shits you.

TeEnS bAD.

Fuck off.

Most adults understand world fucked ok shit needs change, like yesterday. We’ve anyway **reeeehehryayay** *720 spin* Ya, spreading realising it. Great job! That’s terrible, although sounds like someone waiting way long go ER, rather COVID-related.

I knew kitchen manager cut hand prep superglued minor wound shut without properly cleaning disinfecting it. got sepsis blood lost entire leg. 

Sepsis happens FAST hard get control sets it...always clean disinfect wounds, matter minor may seem! School wasted then. Make drop thought that, first still incentive finish think even one shot still 50% effective right? doctor recommending don’t get vaccine even it’s available since I’m low risk cohort (healthy young person). Basically said it’s better wait couple years make sure long-term side effects unless you’re risk. forced parents counted apparently. science drug deal  Colorado ordered 500 ventilators. trump administration intercepted them, gave 100 Colorado *after* one top senators (who facing uphill political race) asked them. Trump let thousands people colorado alone die try help politician get reelected.

Spoiler alert: lost anyway. There's going Ireland. Here, government planning first giving health staff (makes sense), vulnerable 65s second week January. voluntary basis, knows uptake small reduce deaths completely.

As person 18-25 age bracket, I'll probably getting last, long parents vaccinated stop worrying bringing home work.

The government hoping everyone wants vaccine gotten May/June, 6 months now. Can't wait see friends again. feeding anti vaxxers. Get shot fucking inbred looking douche bag. Thank you! We're well! Maybe March see improvement. 

The us needs overhaul, badly. 

The media need reigned told uphold positions responsibly. 

We absolutely need ubi uni healthcare 

We need actual workers right

And flatten rising right wing terrorist groups 

Plus covid! mod could address please:

I continue ask sub use AMERICAN suggestions isolation quarantine instead use country virus moderately control

America country recommending less 14 day quarantine isolations seeing results.

My posts recommending 14 day isolations backed Health Canada. link Canadian information posts removed “rumour misinformation”.

Why pee stored Im sorry undervalueing price freedom. Millions people died past amount freedom enjoy right now. easy forget undervalue it. still prefer larger number casualties compared whats happening china right think people keep displaying ignorance stupidity like this, fuck local culture. can't behave like grown act reasonably like week go full lockdown. Maybe least people remember next time start think act.

sounds mature. realize economy heavily reliant lot revenues? childich behaviour. Local culture much important. fault goverments inept getting people killed. lives worth less anyone elses last protect best throughout pandemic.

Stop calling people selfish displaying selfish, self-absorbed cuntish behaviour possible. still can't wrap head ppl seriously wanted ""arrest TikTok nurses""

I mean, nurses. still save life, whatever do. close contact children adults daily school, rec functions, church.

all things supposed limiting doing, y'know cause fucking pandemic Waiting day testing virus evolve sort 5 second testing strip lick something. excellent scientist mean institution 'good' zero science two weeks ago saying summer two weeks later he’s saying whole year. Stop defending guy point. Every time opens mouth want scream now. *really* need right away? would taking vaccine establish anymore trust literally thousands medical professionals decades experience education understand science better him? He's business dude really taking vs anyone else really change safety. 20k people taking long term side effects changes opinion safety. would literally PR stunt fucking nuts think need one *medicine* 

"" Call doctor today see covid-19 vaccine right you! "" told stick soon available Azar tool stop listening him.

Fauci’s estimate winter right (no one knows better) you’re concerned others. don’t yet know whether/how much vaccinated keeps infectious. OTOH - great news FDA authorized home rapid testing able hold safer controlled gatherings soon. Unfortunately recent Scandal showed really trustworthy, China continues blame everyone else especially Italy. see post stuff like often. Yes. Yes people saying things like that. Maybe see comments hear people. others do. usually get every year, I've become used staying isolated done it. crazy! city Australia ‘outbreak’ dozen people returning overseas got covid still community transmission. increased testing centre hours they’d open til midnight every day !   is! Havent ever heard flu-balls? Enjoy flu... get 100% normal within half year. believe what's new finding wavelength UV kills viruses pathogens harmful human eyes tissue. 62% leaves 38% vulnerable. leaves 125m people unprotected US even 100% vaccination rate. isn’t enough herd immunity (albeit natural infection help drive up) and, 0.65% IFR would allow 815k people potentially die (although natural immunity would fill gap point) 

Contrast 90% immunity vaccine enough reach herd immunity even modest vaccination rates you’ll deaths R0 drops. donate would even bother posting evidence challenges mainstream? boys would “debunk” it. Same. I’ll going back stimulants today “for ADD” it’s really binge eating disorder. ADD, I’m SAHM deal ADD, can’t deal eating disorder. Oxford one decided regulatory agency. I’m going glass half full. need normal again. miss family, miss library, want go knit old ladies. vaccine smells freeeeedooooom!!! Yes, 330 million people. points would true vaccine inactivated virus, mRNA vaccine, science fundamentally difference. mRNA disappears effect weeks, don’t actually ever get virus. EUA also authorized adults, prevents complications arising underdeveloped immune systems. I've dealing outbreaks work since whole thing started 🙃 Across entire world significant number doctors nurses gotten extremely sick cases died due insufficient ppe availability. bought Johnson's propaganda, you? appalling many people ignorant approval process works. parents took see Santa fault. Thanks explanation. sadder wiser. quote real Canadian say, I’m ashamed share continent. don’t want wall. Separate continental shelf create ocean us already Lmao lost, get  Okay. confrontational, I'm pointing dynamic:

1. Amazing, miraculous cause optimism (OP April-June timeline starting thread).
2. Extreme caution and/or disbelief optimism (reply setting timeline ""*semblance""* normalcy back NOVEMBER 2021.
3. Pushback me, reframing virus/vaccination dance actually work counteract reckless behavior keep \~normalcy\~ train full steam other, less dubious ways.
4. Hair-splitting whether optimistic slice posit could end *late* January instead *mid* January (your comment).

Many people seem conditioned grasp worst-case scenarios point, even presented unambiguously positive covid news objective analysis impact. Believe me, understand every individual day every individual life significant (my grandmother made several scares many tough precautions family living nursing home, I'm absolutely hawking hourly updates state/her facility). whole, there's rational way suggest screw-it-up-badly crowd's behavior going undo vaccine accomplishing vast majority (at minimum) vulnerable among us. first doses active (*pre*\-January), door shut partygoers whoever indirectly keeping #1 hotbed deaths (nursing homes) charting like pandemic. whole school thought. exposed maximum amount pathogens immune system becomes stronger. personal expertise weigh it.

One nice thing UV light solution turned off! Switched normally, turned pandemics? Well can’t see people staying home even you’re outside 27/28 people work said getting vaccine. Wtf. Yeet also wear life jackets constantly case spontaneous tsunami comes? want continue wearing masks, that's choice, dont force people wear masks. Like I'm college, want go bars, socialize friends. 3 years, new data Public Health England (PHE) first study published today show vaccine lowed group B meningococcal disease incidence 75% age-groups eligible vaccination. adjusted vaccine effectiveness meningococcal group B disease 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], −33.5 83.2) two-dose priming schedule infants 59.1% (95% CI, −31.1 87.2) two-dose priming schedule plus booster 1 booster dose 12 months lasted least 2 years, authors commentary, Harrison Stephens wrote, ""Although confidence intervals estimate vaccine effectiveness wide exclude 0% (−31.1 87.2), taken together, results suggest substantial effect 4CMenB capsular invasive meningococcal group B disease children United Kingdom. good news highlights real-world effectiveness 4CMenB.""

So vaccine sometimes worked sometimes sometimes made worse, say 50/50 chance effective.

Of course vaccine effective going stop transmission. Well Science LIAR sometimes. -Mac “comparatively small additional effect” stay-at-home orders still decent 15% (point estimate) additional decrease R, still decent sized impact we’re struggling keep R low we’re trying minimize time business school closures necessary! Brilliant news, especially seems reducing transmission well. Game changer start vaccinating younger generations. places getting cold effect cold spread may greater effect policy.


And look here, shocked government would lose WEATHER able help loved ones stay safe.............


We need hit sort reset button country.  new strain that's popped UK makes current vaccine worthless. one worst countries handling second wave. 

Quite opposite. Germany fared better European countries second wave - even number-wise Ireland, Netherlands Nordic countries done better.

It count 500 deaths per day, also largest country Europe one aged well. Almost worth considering twice number single doses... I'll defer experts I'm sure they've considered that. want wear mask every flu season, good you, don’t expect everyone else same. wrote semi-plateau. I.e. something starts looking like plateau phase. see something looking like it, early tell. come across anything yet tweets floating around one made. 

Hopefully one soon. would welcome change see numbers going every day. said May, I'm right you. probably won't, hope outgoing president gets vaccinated publicly assuage looney supporters. take rocket surgeon figure huh. Well I’m probably gonna take Pfizer one anyway that, moderna one proven effective. less side effects I'm folks getting vaccinated sooner.

Both terms building public trust believe people involved creation vaccine DESERVE get sooner.

But may weird way. keeping times. days ""from according ability, according needs"" mentality makes huge comeback. (imo) detriment societies world. might troll. Two good friends legitimately think i’m crazy willing take rushed vaccine. people like ya know Sorry, pulling support Pornhub.

It helps working adults kids little debt. idea honestly, Canada pretty cautious comes giving estimates. confirmed we’d starting vaccinating week days advance. Besides possibly triggering autoimmune response, could *potentially* caused ""bad"" vaccine? two things really matter here; people tolerate businesses forced do. Say water park. need stay shut second Summer? think owners government allow that. 

SHOULD Fauci advising? Hell yes can't even get COVID relief now, wont help people next year. 14, now. delay result tens hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths around world. time experiments, we've got 10k+ people dying COVID day! remember Jan 21 happened yet. Highly doubt first. what? couldn’t care less someone doesn’t want vaccine get it, gets covid.

That .5% make big dent! hear stories noteworthy, rare. Public health measures going driven happens anecdotally margins. gonna remain cautiously optimistic say early fall best, assuming vaccinated ppl continue follow covid mandates cases decrease many vaccines canada expecting get end oc year? US expecting enough vaccinate 20 million people, around 6% population. Pfizer, Oxford Moderna require two doses would isolating testing contact tracing someone like Target cashier even work? assume person contact sick people daily. still cautious without defeatist attitude earth before?!

There must stupid reason it... 

Good idea, next time clean I'm wearing mask. NC receiving 85,000 doses. population 10 million. need 5-6 million vaccinated achieve herd immunity. 

We need shut again, question timing. absolutely blows mind *recent* was. parents born ‘50s Black people *still* treated inhumanely time. never understand humans terrible things humans. Thanks laugh friend needed it. likely going get lot darker dawn :( men?? That’s bit sexist... guy victim domestic violence 8 years! wait long??? people like always think guy aggressor. much choice. available general public late spring early summer. Read article Whats torn about? Dumbass parents get banned. End long destroy 95 percent? r/ChaoticGood Source: chinabad.org EMA looking closer data. confirmed asked data considering side effects discovered GB first day, it’s legit. Doctors scientists still understand anesthesia, see would know safe - that's trials for, conveniently shortened vaccine. saying governments going unnecessary make mask mandates permanent, like airport security still today?

Also another pandemic lethal wouldn’t spread easily people would die it. hope realize that. ridiculous thing lot schools incredibly understaffed due teachers testing positive self-isolate. much learn PE teacher provding science lesson? Yes, takes years. never seen vaccine passes Phase 3 faster Covid-19 vaccines. drugs approved 2nd 3rd year limited conditions, clinical trials (usually Phase 2.5 3) still conducted along it. time durg fully approved, fairly certain long-term side effects minimum. 

I think postmarketing surveillance trials relelvant happens product fully approved use. 

Yes, concept mRNA vaccines around years (or decades), that's misleading statement. actually never done clinical trial scale vaccine backed years data. may say risk may take, risk still really lack administrative delays hurdles 

FDA reviews &amp; administrative hurdles designed ensure safety vaccines rather bureaucratic. Ozzy can’t killed.  Literally nobody saying “every” hospital know damn well that’s case. Secondly, even staff overrun hospitals find time make literally thirty second video. 

You need sort priorities what’s important you. Hope, now. Panic lockdowns introduced Christmas around Europe kinda suggest might, might, emergency situation. plan enough purchased odds one would approved. reason purchase enough vaccinate everyone. enough ensure extra approved.

Even buy vaccine Pfizer, expected unused US expect Moderna, J&amp;J... deliver well.

Of course guessing guess. vaccines trials fail... rumored?? haha everything makes obvious he's thinking 2022 election required sister's hospital now. trust scientist/experts field, trust issues large publicly traded companies. see fortune 100 company says sacrifice internally us sacrifice share holders boarder dangerous field cards propping shareholder returns fall point.

I've literally seen single neighbor, family, friend, etc since March 15th. afford wait take sacrifice wait. worked healthcare would probably get offered. make choice right though choose wait data understand questions healthcare workers have. It’s called due diligence. leave there? don’t know that. 

Yes do. studied passed inspections. arms broken, real-mom said specifically vaccine-related GBS federal failure. 100% states.  Yes PR move smart one. look really terrible pandemic taking millions millions taxpayer money make vaccine suddenly item developed turn around inject first. people getting together work, what’s point keeping apart work? fits martial arts teacher's wife nurse Christian. also reluctant take vaccine. Amazing little bit knowledge discussion do. wish people aren’t quick dismiss vaccine (and science general) without making effort learn it. fact issue become political travesty self. woefully lacking scientific literacy country. didn't. millyuns millyuns millyuns millyuns millyuns comment mention scared? trolling online really life want live? No. look up, done thoroughly. overcame lot business logistical obstacles would otherwise made vaccine trails take years do. determined SAFE effective. 

The part trusting science look information data explains not. Science making conclusions based fact something went quicker normal. two senior staff members Mercy spoke condition anonymity authorized publicly discuss phone call.  call Stitt said doctors didn’t stop “fearmongering” capacity issues could force impose ban elective surgeries, would financial hardship many hospitals.

In words ""We really like keep heads sand. public need know what's going on. stop informing public real scale disaster come smash hospital"". Could straight movie. Mostly, although infection rates might slow death rates, takes time people die. Anti-vaxxers completely irrelevant. respond evidence reason weeks difference zero impact them. data available review rolling basis, like UK done. excuse delay imo. mean, shouldn’t go back 100% normal though. definitely use lesson things need fix. I’m saying social distance forever, lot issues shed light not? waiting line get one like everyone else. Read damn article Yeah TRAGIC. 

Nothing. education campaign. never one regarding virus all. Someone really like talk virus, leadership basically believes Power Positive Thinking Secret. 

We went Operation Warp Speed that, PR education. let social media foreign actors take reinforce fear doubt. get information people want us harm. Great.  think he's reason anti-vaxxers exist?  still people die pools. Ban water guys “ Hehe, guise first 🥸”  Needy elderly people need get first like healthcare workers covid virus year time egregious immediate side effects already known (none), that's trials for. blows mind groups people aren’t will, like said 7 unwilling pretty young. wouldn’t expect age group anti vaccine, husband EMS, would expect 90% plus getting vaccinated. doesn’t make sense. wish 2 best. agree, one jump conclusions numbers alone, ER doc friend mine working nonstop since beginning pandemic witnessed multiple nurses, well May, denied existence COVID, wrote bad-flu, insisted government lying numbers. good chunk still believe pandemic blown proportion. It’s one thing dumbass patients deny COVID even they’re dying it, medical providers entrusted taking care vulnerable? Absolutely unbelievable unforgivable. 25% asymptomatic rate? sure one example could find... 770 people positive coronavirus test 58 symptoms... that's 90 ish percent asymptomatic... probably Lmao knows it’s mistake. can’t understand conversation respond? Last thing site needs shills spewing bullshit conversation can’t even understand. generally experience well Scientists cover data publish studies. Everything available report. exactly conspiracy they're hiding?  Two doses vaccine per every person. think OP shown extra step avoid confusion would hilarious Cleveland finally made Super Bowl canceled Covid. 300/2=150 Well articulated! Thank you! Goalposts go brrr Much better treating cases hospital *before* people need ventilators. Steroids, blood thinners, Vit D, zinc, supplemental oxygen (via face mask) ventilation. March weren’t discovered treatments yet. Come on, man. believe vaccines believe giant corporation honest. Two different things. announced vaccine fast first thing popped head. I’m EXTREMELY pro science vaccines require two doses per person. 300M/2 =150M vaccinated people 2 doses per person Damn that’s longest 2 weeks ever Yea, I’m sure that’s reason don’t want it. 🙄 Yup. personally caught virus got sore-ish throat bad smell specific things disappeared anyway.

## Smoking, Nicotine, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19

Do general conclusions Surgeon General’s reports apply SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19? Here, story becomes complex regard smoking, nicotine, ACE2 receptor. spike protein virus binds specifically ACE2 receptor, upregulated, ie, abundant, smokers.8 general changes lungs smokers may also relevant: impaired mucociliary clearance, increased permeability epithelial lining airways, airways inflammation. Together, smoking-related changes respiratory tract would expected increase risk infection severe COVID-19. likelihood “cytokine storm,” excessive release inflammatory cytokines chemokines considered result severe forms COVID-19, may also increased smoking-induced systemic inflammation.9

In contrast, pharmacological effects nicotine might decrease risk SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tindle et al. suggest nicotine may regulate ACE2 receptors effects renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, although receiving antihypertensive agent blocks ACE change risk COVID-19.10 Beneficial anti-inflammatory effects nicotine also proposed activation nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Eww... hardworking people celebrating something universally positive.

 Quick, let's zing festering misery. Santa Claus /covid/ town BioNTech vaccine approved USA UK. approved ""emergency use"". EU decided ""skip"" ""emergency approval"". approval expected 23. ""regular use"". number mean? Read article explain either. said ""index"".

## Abstract

Implications: commentary addresses state evidence tobacco products, nicotine, COVID-19. evidence effects smoking respiratory infections immune system general examined current understanding tobacco products risk SARS-CoV-2 infection course COVID-19 addressed. platform that's clinical testing 2 years Moderna viruses, cancer vaccines longer companies. Many family members physicians, pharmacists, researchers, scientists medical personnel. involved research process reviewed data thoroughly confident safety vaccine. I’m curious know extensive education levels qualifications legitimate reason worry “science can’t possibly happen fast!” I’m sure it’s easy people little scientific knowledge doubt work hundreds/thousands researchers physicians it’s easy point fingers idea going can’t bothered read single scientific paper. Nurses far likely doubt vaccine education focus virology physiology way medical education does. doctors understand vaccines made understand safe important take. mRNA vaccines researched past several years vaccines take long usually develop due red tape lack funding, two issues severe pandemic. ALWAYS risks vaccine, person common sense realizes benefits far outweigh risks. hey, doctors scientists know, right? even give us much credit. governor massive fucking *Christmas party* mansion. strolling around shit smeared corduroys... What's timetable distribution tho? hence ""The Great"" title. also one created Russia's Navy. point people arrived say this. don’t think offensive much bad grammar, Latinos mean group Latinos Latinas Well said, Swamp Ass 3. can't, actual studies peer review boards have. 10%, $150,000 according article, CARES act funds city owned golf course? absolutely disgusting someone needs stocks center town. hate golf courses general, land used something better, whole thing. talk already over. still plenty time get worse. absolutely infantile argument. “The US bad China fine”. 12 brain dead? 

Also, educate they’re Uighurs making asinine comments admitting don’t know you’re talking about. world would much better place people like would stay quiet instead opening knowledge mouth Please don’t vote Right doesn’t ease work load Santa cant deliver everyone time year anyway. quarantine going US Canada many border impose similar laws (My research showed 92 Countries cross border restrictions place 49 countries closed)

So calm wait... lucky see real santa July. know ones malls fake since Santa cant go back North pole overnight avoid travel restrictions. Let alone deliver whole world one night wait canadian/US border 10 days (And even counting times needs restock sleigh... no, that's misinformation. None top 4 vaccine uses dead live vaccine. Anything's better nothing, could mean death.

It's die Pfizer. collective scientific community necessarily correct, especially scientific revolution. Thanks Internet, midst scientific revolution comes health, diet, lifestyle forth. seen long term effects corona virus? 

The vaccine safe effective save millions lift tons poverty lockdowns lifted.

I'm ""bullying"" people lying capitulate anti-vaxxers. 

Now arguing call anti-vaxxers fuckface losers, agree. Thats mean unhelpful bullying.

But calling vaccine safe effective not. - Netherlands: assumably giving aid closed businesses perhaps even citizens work

- California: told go fuck itself, like 49 states, federal government, forcing states choose money saving lives. think virus mutate rendering current vaccines (or clinic trials) ineffective? I’m happy! mental. Yup, I've noticed correlation, too. antibody class/isotype believe - mucosal surfaces like respiratory tract “patrolled” IgA antibodies, vaccines induce IgG, lives serum, get systemic infection going first IgG job. IgA-based vaccines developed, they’re much difficult produce variety reasons surrounding way IgA response induced body.  DEFINITELY. believe want. downvote all
You want. Reminds movie A-Team: ""That's partial paralysis!"" small universe know three people gotten it, anecdotal evidence match statistical evidence. reason 2019 thought 2020 would awesome year. normally feelings upcoming year goddamn dead wrong. Ah, okay, troll. I’m sure I’d characterize February impacts “big”. It’s less 10% difference death rates beginning February death *rate* end significantly different, pales comparison could done good control.

I think thing keep mind even though elderly deaths significant portion total, death rate, hospitalization rate, time lost illness, chance ongoing health problems younger folks (&lt;65 even &lt;50) high enough months uncontrolled epidemic would *still* terrible even without elderly deaths. vaccinating high-risk groups going almost nothing prevalence general population. Canadians already approved handled thing quite well.

Also, 22 voting members FDA utilized independent panel people seizing PPE, calling democratic hoax, etc. don’t rust rushed vaccine well, least she’s brave enough it. We’ll see goes soon, least normal ppl won’t get take first couple months anyway. Long Island it’s northwell health hospitals it’ll interesting California twice cases Germany half population. full lockdown recently? serious claims. provide statistically significant data back up? Go get flu shot meantime. mean, get you’re saying, control food choose put body. heart attacks (and cases common preventable diseases) stem diet. it’s good time stop eating artery clogging crap start eating vegetables. point innocent ""questioning"" then? possible purpose serve except scare others taking vaccine? someone allegedly taking vaccine available sure parrot lot anti-vax talking points. probably not, clinical trial inject sick day. Also severely limited supply vaccine. better give someone risk who's already hospitalized hail mary try. read article, thanks, interested part;

Moderna stopped testing highest dose vaccine trial number reports severe adverse reactions.

To me, goes counter point ~

The second injection also supposed quite unpleasant many people.

I think ""was supposed be..."". Yeah i’m sure debate was: want take away already limited doses frontline exposed workers appease people probably wont take also dont opportunity take months anyway? Yes hard understand someone whine people ignore advice public health experts soon get vaccine ignore advice public health experts. point people care now. Unlike Netherlands, California cannot print money give unemployed - that's Federal governments job. full lockdown, many people starve run money feed families hunger known 100% fatality rate. idea kind supply available distribute? Pfizer hardly distribute next year. Either way road end, wondering long road is(when enough everyone) Excuse me, I'm antisymptomatic. Thank much. symptomatic extra steps. Lol wut? 

Property taxes way lower Ca. one family members gets vaccine rest don't.....could person contagious spread covid-19 rest family? shower thought since sometimes hear people getting sick flu shot, etc. Thanks! health secretary self-serving government announced basically details day put London lockdown. looks much like attempt shift blame--""It's fault virus got worse!"" fact liar? literally lying said hour ago. screenshot? dont want prolapsed symptomatic DEFINITELY man made

DEFINITELY? could mistaken, reddit tells me, US ""normal"" along? anyone lend hand? omg what?! happy could bridge gap ""covid bullshit hoax"" ""hard imagine responsibly open night clubs movie theaters 2025"" crowds seem royally pissed 30 second tiktok video. already are. Shelby County TN (Memphis) 15 free ICU Yeah, that's like... opinion, man... AZN, J&amp;J name vaccines come market. they’ll find new “strain” covid doesn’t get killed vaccine we’ll right back now. reality countries afford 2 shot process really need forgo countries can't get priority shots... pandemic going continue much longer third world countries.

Or massive reparations payments making countries wait back line speed things lately. People need stop getting way science

The irony calling politicians jump way science force approval.

The scientists different countries different approval processes different speeds. call bureaucrats, like, ""sitting hands,"" (AKA following established processes) politicians. Yeah point is. want wear mask public fine. I’ll wear get vaccinated it’s required enter certain buildings. Fine. 

Canada also approved it. 

Should Canada considered trustworthy source?  knew 10 people almost right away.  Elderly, CPAs, someone died going hospital something unrelated, outbreak daycare, etc.  I've lost count point probably 30 people 2 dead. else would trust, conspiracist religion? Lmao long term effects arrise? mechanism proposing? they? 4loko used shitload caffeine it, addition fuckload alcohol. young ever tried it, vaguely remember stories people dying drinking it. Like said, administered members public. yet released general public large. quite people want wait first wave public vaccination intend get nothing major comes first wave.

One reason want make sure issues discovered previous stages testing. Clinical/laboratory testing occasional miss something hard account situations limited testing group size. give example, 1998 FDA approved RotaShield vaccine, later found cause intussusception infants 12 months. Due discovery, ACIP withdrew recommendation vaccinating infants RotaShield. doubtful (hopefully) organization responsible testing vaccine prior gaining FDA approval aware potential complication decided doctor documents submitted FDA otherwise cover up. likely simply complication never came testing.

Additionally, testing discover issues present within duration test. If, example, particular medication side effect present 8 months, testing took place period 6 months would never see (or may see cases suspect correlation). This, along previous point, two reason additional testing new medication approved released public. round testing called ""Phase 4"".

Finally, even conceptual vaccine major side effects, still issue manufacturing it. multiple cases companies recalling vaccines due potential/discovered contamination production. Rushing production increase potential manufacturing errors occur. However, allowing time pass allow manufacturing issues discovered &amp; corrected potentially contaminated vaccines recalled. Give people ""Flair"" come pretentious. ""I'll none it!"" sorts. Look begin Read actual clinical data trials.

Can tell long term studies done vaccine?

That's problem. long term studies. 

Some people started developing narcolepsy two years taking H1N1 vaccine.

The reality know cause long term problems. estimate risk (probably low) unknown. Phase 1 tests safety main primary goal. phases look safety data get clinicial hold something crops up.

I see plausible mechanism mRNA vaccines give cancer. would need sort freak event also injected/infected reverse transcriptase convert mRNA back DNA. need second freak event one cells integrate DNA genome. need another freak event integration site oncogenic. need another freak event cell survives immune surveillance (you have, right now, probably 1-5 cancerous cells body. immune system constantly cleaning house).


So short... No... Thinking could cause cancer beyond reason. part? part familiar with? thought knew covid? clear roadmap gets vaccinated refer too?

I want able provide guidance elderly parents non-English speaking elderly relatives. 

I also want know get low risk person can’t find source trust. family lives country. chairman said families children may exposed disease follow guidelines Centers Disease Control Prevention

I kinda' feel like can't go telling people follow CDC guidelines CHOSE FIRST PLACE! absolutely agree. fact „trust“ „believe“ thrown around regards vaccines proves everyone thinks logically knows getting incalculable risk. 50% people could vaccinated could go back full normalcy given vulnerable getting first. *sigh* proved nothing beyond help. See ya. Stop projecting, person zero medical experience saying physicians wrong. Merry Covids everyone! love people like suddenly think big pharma greatest thing ever best interests mind. paying you? Lol didn’t die saline injection. 92 page booklet data explains death. explanations linked article. 

Also article old. 

This extremely misleading. selfish people wear masks now. think lot people's true colors going come think personally safe, we'll see many people actually care others. People joking would really look bad Queen got vaccine died week later 94. 

It may joke, would absolutely devastating global health actually happened. New Flu shots get done yearly, method used different regular method. person close scientists everyday would much trusting viewpoint would think  know anything yellow^3 old, new given treatment. Ok. testing patients returning homes, determining nursing homes performing adequate quarantine procedure virus determined require “droplet precautions” only? understand long took everyone come around realization airborne virus? wasn’t March. Droplet precautions mean ordinary mask clean gloves, washing hands patients. Airborne precautions require N95 must fit tested for, gloving, gowning changing patients. So: MADE SURE PPE THAT? one. Literally one. even COVID wards necessary ppe jobs. shut right fuck behind little desk little room blaming people actually perform jobs knowledge virus , goddamned equipment, zero barely functioning bumbling support required assist federal crisis. heard vaccine make sick, Luciferon Oh, see mods removed comments unnecessarily hostile. still see hx really want look, assuming delete like sketchy liar are.

You clearly argue bad faith going lie clearly said Citation needed think thinking prosymptomatic Awesome Way, way harder qualify nurse states AFAIK.  boredom eating killing me. lost 70 pounds past years I've gained least 20 back since beginning pandemic. I'm things, think food. I'm stuck house, food one pleasures left life, lose that, what's left? tough finding hobbies disabled, poor, live small space. Yeah including cousin. wears mask guess outside it’s infringing rights.  Maybe I’m thinking Pfizer then. One handful bells vaccine group (still apparently within normal background range), none placebo. Unless moderna later revised. mostly open, pretty surprising.  think shutdowns clearly working anymore. hurts people's wallets. approved emergency vaccine horrible side effects would far, far lose whatever respect I'm pretty sure never first place. agent this? point sources? That’s....that’s kinda suspicious bruh. I'm actually terrified spike points coming Wisconsin. gun hunting season spike likely started two days ago progress next weeks. Christmas, Badgers playing ax means packed bars. political infighting São Paulo Bolsonaro, like got Butantan-run phase 3 trials delayed. ones lose Brazilians. Various US states mandate vaccines schools too, bulletproof without doctor's note.

In short term matter, vaccine 16+ right even started trials young kids yet. Honestly seems concerning. Yes appear, excess mortality shows damage virus, people died it. proof problems covid social class issue. read comments forst question got asked dozen times thought riding jetski far sea terrifying Revive me, ray gun!

\*Frenzied firing ray gun directions\* probably wont seeing impact probably Feburary/March. Lmao want front fire whatever happens them. Corporations constantly mastering spinning shit. claim already? This. Thank this. many ignorant comments saying “forced” take vaccine...when reality zero idea little research happened regarding vaccine grand scheme things. really came hospital told would “forced” take emergency-approved vaccine right now...I’d taking extended leave work something else mean time. Good. confíscate jet ski doesn’t know follow simple protocol. statement completely right. Old people create fatalities, case numbers cross infections boosted mobile younger people mild disease symptoms. go ahead stadium’s won’t empty. Unless IOC force Japan comply rule. still go baseball games, pack iszakaia’s stand lines shoulder shoulder! RONA running streak right Japan! What’s GBS? patient. Immunity can’t happen overnight, takes time. think allocate proposed relief money vaccine rollout know nothing Eisenhower danger then, no, think veteran, support personnel.

A classic example, someone controlling drones US, missions several different countries. Nobody would say ""they served x"" veteran ""Y"". hospital work gave first 50 doses vaccine high risk staff yesterday. Today start vaccinating ER Covid floor staff. 50% hospital’s patients Covid patients know rough couple months left, I’m tearing end sight. That's fair that's also fully intend receive vaccine I've stated multiple times throughout chain. vaccine tested others classification trust it. Plot line Utopia intensifies. Doesn’t trust product(s)

🤔 definitely following :) They’re making us stick around ~15 minutes administration shot safe Like said, choose selfisolate, Btw, someone sick symptoms, stay home, lets say 60-70%, gets vaccine, get it, selfisolate symptoms, 5% immuncompromised conditions minimal chanses get infected. 

Who paying small business' shut right now? I’m relaying communicated me. need shoot messenger vaccine doesnt stop spread though effects. company says anyway.

Another question genuinely know answer, healthcare professional required vaccines given child protect much deadly things? Typhoid, mmr, whooping cough, polio, type thing. always thought wasnt mandatory Paper: 14 really stupid? idea science trusting science becoming religious like cult It’s really sad actually people refuse take vaccine literally billions people going die don’t access life-saving medicine zerohedge.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

People: fucking idiot

Dont trust anything blindly even science Yes, best knowledge, two possible (not proven) side effects associated modern vaccines, manifest within two months maximum.

COVID linked male infertility. worried children, definitely get vaccinated. reports either COVID vaccine affecting female fertility (and theoretical reason would.....there theoretical reasons COVID could affect male fertility.) simplest answer is, generally, correct one. would inclinded believe, speculatively, NATO origin, engineered.

Nope! part studies. could unknown contraindications there. prudent wait out. mean, even seen commercials TV vaccines yet. need see deciding one take. giving educated guesses. change time passes situation changes. Don’t take words gospel.  problem subjective experiences can't shared others without agreed upon language express them. metaphysics tries gap. 

Ironic, someone read ancient books human wisdom false sense spiritual superiority, calling imprisoned one. Could be. 

Or could different people feel differently things. Maybe people rely non verbal communication others. Maybe people sensitive touch tight fitting clothing others. maybe people find masks depressing. 

I’m wearing mask want help prevent mass deaths, hate every second it. possibility mass deaths table, I’m done. research shows predictability whether district person classes driven prevalence covid, presence absence teachers union.

These science driven decisions.

WHO, Fauci, American Academy Pediatrics, basically everyone said default position schools (at least elementary schools) person classes. public health crisis that.

Spread driven schools open dismaying watch teachers unions say ""we care children."" That's great! Moderna vaccines used starting Monday? thought meeting December 17.. maybe made day up.  pointless get first batch, enough. politicize make spectacle vaccination like US does. ""Look, plane vaccines arrived Chicago airport"", ""Look, trucks carrying vaccine leaving"", etc. Plus, lockdown, unlike US. survived long, wait bit longer get good SAFE vaccine review. Unless one people working knee deep Covid since March, it’s place tell people feel right now. 

Even *have* shoes whole time, don’t get dictate others feel. Vaccine rifles mounted humvees % everyone age group? prepared part % you’re afraid needle? Medical ethics require consent operation treatment. want require vaccination public activities like work school, fine, blanket vaccine mandate going fly. people smarter bubbles would getting bigger. disappointing vaccines efficacy around 94-95%. anyone else find fishy? know it’s controversial agree. wear mine little flexibly summer that’s it. lips expensive. I’m getting money’s worth. Also Celiac similar nightmares. struggle real. Covid dreams too. Ill probably ulcer time over. RemindMe! 6 months ""SparkyBoy414 get 100% normal within half year"" don’t, that’s reality business right now. cannot shut public transit. way fewer riders, folks still need service.

And rider reported us positive case. It’s place believe them, that’s facts.

We best. Many riders work Amazon distribution centers, UPS, hospitals etc. live here. fucked. I'm guy, amigo! seem confusing social end pandemic versus actual scientific end pandemic. It’s important understand somebody means say vaccines won’t end pandemic. Obviously, hope end actual pandemic. Socially, think almost guaranteed restrictions fall away behavior revert back pre-pandemic-ish deaths cases drastically fall. actually put conditions, live, get work thus kind employment get, interact heavily depend availability transit.

If option force vaccinations order allow participation society, option B massive, complicated, costly program check people vaccinated inconvenient follow option A, sure ain't going option B.

Your liberty without conditions. Nature, case COVID-19, simply care free are, accommodate reverse impossible. also American living Germany honest, US's approach really much better Germany's fall? thick noggin? Aerosols reach distance without masks. Viral load less vaccinated person. reduce even masks. argument states pointless even data. fuck people trying throw caution wind immediate gratification? dumb idiotic logic. Ugh... health insurance White House Security? Ok.... gotta stick foam ear plugs nose good go anywhere Knowing already know, often wonder finding later went behind scenes, office. imagine come becomes less able threaten. Given know, I'm sure there's worse. countries would trust first agency approves something, would likely need one country approve things. 

The thing really know something rushed others process slow. certain process followed always same.

I know someone working multinational radio telescope project race american european teams build exactly anntenna put peak mountain. american team got onto mountain first showed press. However later fixes oxygen supply, european team could finish valley move done. REALLY grasping straws arnt we. Thanks reply. really hope treatment works her! already back shut welcome! Yes, is. Masks uncomfortable depressing. I’ll wear one help prevent mass deaths, risk mass deaths goes away, I’m taking never putting back again. I’ll give February possibly even March, that’s all. vulnerable people get vaccine becomes available normal people, I’m done kind restriction. lies .when u close beds u always full capacity No, statistical fact remains Covid's mortality rate .01% young adults. vulnerable vaccinated, need injection there's risk me. seems pretty irresponsible, yes. God woke nap went ""oh shit, gotta fix fast gets worse"" Thanks projection bud. self importance makes blockhead. anti-science like wearing sign around neck says “I’m retarded”. It’s clear we’ll disagree don’t understand anything scientific meant work Probably since first word HAIs “hospital” outpatient facilities hospitals. know lot guys really like wearing masks welcome keep wearing them. Hell I'll probably use neck gaiters cold winter. summer though? people done wearing getting vaccines. can't keep moving goalposts. go fun things like concerts sports events want to, totally you. I'm sure guys like staying home I, also like going time time. think everyone really nice anything fun save grandma whatever, year vaccines promised would end public time come back reality. American living Europe seems lot distrust amongst people whether vaccines safe quickly produced; going standard approval hopefully helpbsome people trust vaccination process more. also issue bloc solidarity. beginning pandemic, allocation resources uneven throughout EU created lot problems, especially since stability EU major concern right pandemic serving stress test well bloc handle widespread crisis. making sure repeat mistakes spring seems key agenda politicians  thread tends better rest subreddit. tend even bother commenting anywhere else sub. someone else said, huge huge portion reddit seems ""in"" covid. Heard one lady went deaf. Lost hearing left ear. Anecdotal course. shit, Sherlock! lockdown approach total disaster. I'm buddy, guy! seems kinda snow-flakey do, I’m fine reposting. Didn’t think much wrote it, really venting end long shift long string shifts.

The replies support helps emotionally. feel isolated days there’s lot solace knowing still reach way feel heard supported. know it’s text worthless orange arrows somehow help.

Stay safe. 1 case residing dormitory today. Case 58562 asymptomatic, detected took COVID-19 pre-departure test preparation return China. previous tests Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) negative. serological test result come back positive, indicates likely past infection. precautionary measure, close contacts dormitory workplace placed quarantine. Virus always gonna virus matter still hugs friends, despite risks. hurt. 

wtf?! hospitals aren’t forcing anyone anything. hospital staff ones forced deal consequences peoples’ refusal something basic wearing mask. 


They’re allowed celebrate vaccine. literally not. clearly paying attention. Found new normal crew member could also you’ve it, body fighting now, it’s cut dry. It’s Doctor’s job act side caution. mean Russia long history scientific achievements, Russians much willing trust science American European counterparts. name vaccine Sputnik it’s reference Russian scientists first world put satellite space, followed first man first woman space. Don’t underestimate scientific capabilities, they’re backwards third world country like they’re often portrayed.   Speak yourself.             

It philosophical concept breathing exercises well feels like heaven landed chest filled joy. INTERPRETING saying philosophical concept, then, like said, like living, sweaty, breathing sex compared text book sex. sorry imprisonment head. LET'S GO GET VACCINE Yeah it’s 3 weeks flatten curve bro Great job guys! get back Flu working last 200 years! - Wait figure one again? anyone say placebo? understanding: false statement say vaccine developed past several months science behind vaccine work decades. moment novel coronavirus. Canada much lower population density. US states low population densities actually quite well. instance, alaska much better numbers Canada right lists assumptions pretty clearly bottom, seem pretty reasonable vaccine medicine headache fatigue side effect?  there's huge dif thinking we're gonna constant quarantine thinking we're gonna bunch best practice changes. Things changed forever, mean quarantine forever. No, technology vaccine used easily produce vaccines different types coronavirus. flu shots every year, may also coronavirus shots there’s new outbreak.  btw reason American f**ked hard right now. accept ""I trust science"" actually sentence said. Like means window ""I trust science"", allow side say ""Well dont trust science, fair fair"". HUGE problem. Reddit find lots people replying common sense sentences ""I agree"", common sense like candy store, say agree things agree common sense. allowing side exist LITERALLY making side exist. Americans really play themselves, even realize it. Tasmania, February, thing exploded. wife Betsy asked: right lay emergency supplies? Yes, said, bad idea. bought five-pound block cheese, big bag rice, bottles Clorox, $900 worth dog food. Showing priorities. Currently absolutely - since haven’t chance vaccinate at-risk groups yet. 

Once get vaccinated, truly case cares? Yes! surviving existing replaced living thriving. 95 year old people people? totally okay deny care?

Note: POINT poster say woman stroke 95 years old. could 40 know. Bought LSAT prep course- money well spent considering result Teachers too!! Get kids back school, need keep teachers safe!! course are. getting daily tests first deployed.   mean conspiracy? That's part normal political even scientific process. Waying one risk messaging other. certainly also connected fact ICU-admissions 101% capacity Stockholm likely also several hospitals around country. 

They say capacity 680 ICU beds. needed patients well. none urgent hospital treatments cancelled Stockholm elsewhere. Personnel transferred children’s hospital treat covid patients. 

This tragedy. mean probably Canada functioning central government US doesn’t. Newsom doesn’t power purse extent Congress does. Congress doesn’t anything, like direct California treasury pay hundreds billions. Quote abstract: enter nervous system crossing neural–mucosal interface olfactory mucosa, exploiting close vicinity olfactory mucosal, endothelial nervous tissue, including delicate olfactory sensory nerve endings. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 appears follow neuroanatomical structures, penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas including primary respiratory cardiovascular control center medulla oblongata.

So turns reason people lose sense smell virus trying enter brain stem via olfactory bulb. Terrifying. 15 year old yet threatened fornicate mother!? crazy time alive. Cuba.... almost exact amount time studying vaccine COVID. So, think know there's long term effects COVID vaccine? 

I get someone would assume likely vaccine long term effects virus. breath said restrictions repealed ""several months"" second half 2021. idea metric question purely hypothetical. least 356,000 people United States died usual since coronavirus pandemic took hold country Still sources deaths. hard answer question, want keep flipping ignoring it, that's cool, too. true? Jesus. can’t even keep many people dying stay pretty top it. lockdown's goal minimize risk reducing interactions people minimum. 

I understand can't reduce zero, reduce significantly. means virus's R0 go well 1.0, means virus eventually ""burn out"". stricter lockdown, faster burn out. 

NZ eradicated virus, feasible.

In places, temporary and/or limited lockdowns (by area) could keep virus manageable numbers, manageable mean numbers contact tracing quarantine feasible.

The economic ""misery"" happen regardless, part population avoid crowded places, restaurants, bars, movie theaters even they're open, traveling holidays reduce expenses even income affected. cause businesses go under, people fired, consume less, trigger businesses close people fired.

We know economy suffer saw countries lock down, like Sweden.

And hard decide businesses help, affected crisis would gone business regardless.

On hand, lockdown, help everyone measures, instead taking arbitrary decisions afterwards.

Your argument seems be, least partially, lockdowns perfect, even use them. a, frankly, absolutely stupid take. Yes, lockdowns gonna save 100% people getting virus. that'd ideal, decides lockdown worked not. lockdown works virus spread slows significantly, meaning fewer deaths, fewer cases, far less pressure health services etc. I've cruise scheduled October 2021 since fall 2019; hoping shit get back normal pay-in-full date June/July thread keeping sane this.

I can't believe might actually get go! too. Where’s vaccine pick back normal life? Wtf places still mall Santa's?

How stupid places. Missed bunch birthday parties year. want hug people again. prevent spillovers becoming epidemics pandemics—with science, strong public health measures, good national leadership, community cooperation

Ahhh good hear US continued screwed going forward fun imagine normal even look like... really like working home.. crowds everywhere.. less traffic. miss going eat, sorta. certainly shitty places ill never return too, trying imagine ""normal"" like tough. know 1/3 population wont get vaccine. kill rest us go concerts again? might still wear one airports grocery stores. Can't hurt. nice take work restaurants, though. nice go sit-down restaurants again, period. constitution explicitly state Swedes right roam lol... though it’d still better people took care other. see media Thank you. Everyone even people subreddit acting like everything over. People saying continue wear masks avoid contracting spreading illnesses *besides* Covid. Yeah won’t enough vaccines people won’t even chance getting summer. people surprised this? imagine majority say listen science give damn vaccinated. two faced thing going right now. Yes, ambulances sick 95 year olds them.

Triage something emergency rooms every day, first come first serve system. Rumour secret test initially conducted hundred “volunteers” given experimental vaccine purposefully exposed COVID. didn’t find side effects vaccine worked decided speed things approve phase 3 trials. Russia vaccine research done governmental level company level like west, Putin took gamble odds side.  spot ""normalcy"" I'm mostly looking forward point things stop getting worse start getting better. turning point feel good even still ways ""life used know it."" Polls mean nothing. Look 2020 2016 election. Polls horrifically wrong. Yes, pandemic highly contagious deadly virus. find interesting neighbors North 1/4 infection rate US, yet citizens subject perpetuating spread virus dangerous workplace environments sake ""keeping people employed""? Pfizer, 4 vaccine arm 0 placebo. 1 4 confirmed associated vaccine since person history Bell’s Palsy.

For Moderna, 3 vaccine arm 1 placebo. 2 3 resolved resolving, cases likely mild.

Keep mind infections cause Bell’s Palsy (including Covid). One person Moderna 3 reported sort upper respiratory infection weeks prior. it’s case case, really hard draw conclusions. Something watch, nothing would lose sleep over.

Bell’s Palsy somewhat common, pregnancy also causes Bell’s Palsy rates higher reported trials. I'm sure say that. Climate change getting worse, anything happen joke, literally 3-4 friends thing, except 200 miles away city killer deals homes near mountains actual acreage. 

And I'm like... know, year two everything back normal... going extremely miss able casually go beer garden go eat restaurant town? Yes, know companies promised long term work home... they're management. There's way going need office least day week. I'm sure WFH culture die completely many roles 5 years, kept permanently.

It'd one thing bought vacation/summer house something, big giant primary residences filled way expect someone fill planned actually living there. kinds houses exist land dirt cheap therefore build big. Thank you. good boy, great family cat. 18 perfect check up. wear glasses due sensitivity hard time wearing contacts, so... soon safe, I'm ditching mask actually always thought said “normal” different everyone. It’s universal term I'm going flip script expect apocalypse 2021 things go Fuck that. I’m 70 pre existing conditions. get vaccine teachers. There's severe shortage nurses right now. doubt would literally fire nurse telling truth. dunno. mom works VA, made several posts past couple months bad getting. Real question: one take? Aye, kind get feeling lot people thread have:

A: Never worked really hard toward something cannot understand must like folks.

B. friends can't relate people taking time together celebrate good news.

C. variety reasons going hate people video regardless doing. gets approved next week like Pfizer get shipped frontliners? don’t enough vaccinate outside ED/ICU staff us hospitalists full lists covid. covidtards go clapping ""Omg guy, he'll let us get first"", meanwhile go test rushed vaccine, horrible side effects appear ok 0.001% users die, ok 0.001% population die covid, kill global economy that. one shot right? Tell kids:

 [Single mother raising 12 kids sister dies COVID - New York Daily News really hope Sweden national conversation funding elderly care things calm COVID. Even pandemic, it’s rounds cuts cost saving rounds, it’s really quite harsh.  Another east vanner! 1. I’d rather wrong.
2. surprise new pandemic grew spillover coronavirus wild animal, likely bat. predictable, reported Spillover, 2012, knowledgeable scientists predicting that. surprise woefully unprepared world was—and especially US—to cope it.
3. Ed Yong piece? Ed terrific read whenever can. Yes Moderna vaccine holds water. People get vaccinated vectors spread. main driver herd immunity time lag. assuming that's he's coming from. It’s couple weeks 2021.  still think would restrictions like masks stuff

I think masks completely eradicated august 2020 supposed big year wife I.

A trip Bahamas wife cousin's bachelorette trip.

A couple trips NYC broadway shows.

A summer weekend Vancouver, BC.

Potentially week trip Belgium groezrock music festival.

A week Vegas punk rock bowling music festival.

An anniversary trip Cancun.

We saving ton money ton fun things.

Instead that, got laid off. bazillion cloth masks. It'd shame stop wearing them. Right now, much. lots distinct geographic variants D614G strain, travel closure. 

This one spike protein mutation, analyzed, reason assume different resistant antibodies. Correct. happened flu vaccine. Even flu vaccine season effective, still prevented complications/hospitalizations part. 

We heard still get sick taking flu, overwhelming majority get severe cases. fact bats insectivorous make likely source virus spillovers? Don’t get started Amazon Prime video commercials.... way world works. Oh, thought meant actual invisible ink, like secret messages stuff. It’s much easier “close” borders entirely surrounded ocean you’re major hub world economy. New Zealand, Taiwan Iceland done well, extent serve models US Italy Germany next pandemic threat?—limited. lessons learned, perfect model. Hardly ""shocking news"". continuing absolutely cretinous dialogue? pathetic. Exactly. don’t know sub tends downvote anyone looks data closely cases high rising. not. Read top vast majority people recover COVID less 10 months. Vaccine side effects take longer 10 months manifest. That's averages thank data point, that's even higher. 62% much much worse Pfizer Sputnik etc. leaves 3-7x many people vulnerable 90-95% vaccine. 95% vaccine could theoretically get us Covid elimination high compliance, 62% like flu vaccine - better nothing still allows widespread community transmission millions cases. 

Why would waste resources manufacturing distributing vaccine allows 4x cases? buddy pharmacist works large state hospital Florida Health Informatics said things would normal late spring early summer. think pretty spot I'm going expertise. nothing certain gives hope pharmacist works hospital educated kinds things thinks so. don’t know accurate numbers are. way knowing, point. Many Americans don’t trust Chinese government—and many people China don’t trust current US government. blame them? bought guitars used rest bills. Trusting science one thing, trusting scientists... fallible... another. I'd like cautious optimism. 

Mentioning kind specific time-frame 'normalcy' create potentially unrealistic expectations some. want undersell amazing work vaccines - check CRISPR. me, that's like manned mars mission compared this. might find interesting get inspired learn more! sorry loss. biggest fear, cat would get die. I've heard happening people well. Depends city county. California state law says combined property taxes cannot 1% assessed property value, poster still correct: lower tax rates, higher out-of-pocket total. “I trust science” like saying “I believe science”. scientist would say this? I'm Canada Macy's always hear awesome stuff it!! go shopping, winter, cold winds, nose running, wipe nose like five times reach store, grab mask, grab cart, look fancy things, uh popcorn \*grabs it\* nah flavor \*puts back\*. like popcorn too, right? So, want nasty nose stuff (invisible ink cart handle packages) hands, mask, cloth, door knob, kitchen counter? no? disinfect hands touching public surfaces. dont touch face.

edit: yes, scientists dont believe formites main route. Still, virus. active hours days surfaces. collect higher chance actually manage get inside you. wife used biologist studied fruit bats Costa Rica. loves bats public’s perception overwhelmingly negative. feel bats viewed general public post-COVID? think government-sanctioned extermination certain countries? would ecosystem? no. kids school since March. I’ve dined inside restaurant, seen friends movie since then. life disrupted severely honestly it’s really really fucking hard.  mean keeping people employed right? *she want hug mother. long lasting effects? Sure probably survive kind problems someone stuck rest lives said, 20th 50 states deaths per 100k. way first I'd agree even close.

Id also agree hospitals overrun not. one would know took it. think everyone would assume would take first faith it.

I answered that. point? YVR airport worker username confused minute. would considered good enough immunize someone flu despite one dose. Very, impressive stuff. biggest question remaining mind whether sterilizing immunity, frankly would miracle. US coronavirus deaths per capita country world. I'd say pretty apparent purpose rules is. Technically 1905 Supreme Court decision (in case smallpox). HOWEVER, think mandating vaccine especially Roe v. Wade decision would challenged Supreme Court ultimately overturned. believe another redditor mentioned putting link SMS intentional government policy avoid teaching people click links makes less diligent source information. would expected outline big changes advice least. deserves damned, he’s ceo pharmaceutical company similar data Pfizer vaccine, mechanism action. 2 basically analogs. Great news. Prob sitting cure sorts diseases, hordes profits distributes extremely addicting damaging substances, yet ""good guy"" bc ""wait"" get vaccine. crock shite. old article, rehash old one? think already reached humanitarian crisis level. also resources flexibility continue social distance.

They continue pay loads testing players coaches means keep isolated.

Workers meat packing plant live compact environments, oftentimes multi-generational homes, who's kids heading school, etc. etc. going far higher risk bringing virus in.

We're also 3 weeks two thirds teams done season. lot value cutting line negative PR would insane. rich. believe freedom without responsibility, kind freedom teenager comprehends. could governor told say, knowing would good enough some, check. unable check. know check. Got love everything somewhat sketchy ""conspiracy theory"". Propaganda finest. Amen! Anyone rushes vaccines due diligence causes adverse effects, injuries death also blood hands

If believe scientific method, believe rushing process risking harm good. you’re Instagram @dr.martaperez @mamadoctorjones OBGYNs discuss vaccines pregnancy you’re interested! reason global shortage, tell people there’s global shortage. Don’t spread misinformation “there’s evidence works” it’s ""There SPECIFIC EVIDENCE suggest wearing masks mass population POTENTIAL BENEFIT"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, said media briefing Geneva, Switzerland, I'm sure I'm reading right, regards covid, smoke currently keep smoking? former smokers worse results? missing something? anti vaxx feel way tolerance anti science superstition think surprised (regarding people waiting know safe effective taking it). people really signing questions asked pandemic stopped virus back May. making people Submit. Stories like case point: ""we know there's good reason rules proven risk, must Submit anyway say so"". 

This lockdowns going like fart church USA - positively despise hypocrisy pointless restriction. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Wishing harm death result 14 day ban. LOL, Tennessee, Arky, Bama done better. don’t know quickly it’ll work, it’s responsive data setting target date normalcy. I’ve worked pharmaceutical companies. science making new drug vaccine usually takes years. That’s long science usually takes show safety effectiveness. already rushing process worldwide crises. You’re rushing process even because, what? science. want there. wearing masks?

From article: ""All three legislators who've publicly disclosed positive diagnoses say wore masks face-covering around others trip Pierre.""

No word whether others around wearing masks. idiotic. Thousands people dying every day. people charge approving need working around clock every day make decision. Saturday stepson fever 101.6, lethargy, congestion. decided get tested day. got positive results morning.

I asymptomatic weekend. today, exhaustion started hit morning I'm starting get dry cough. 

My work put 30th. then, time quarantine take care family. I'm rebelling muh HiVeMiNd!!! I'm special! Look way: got past hazing next class plebes. That’s rational way thinking. 

However, reality relatively significant subset people doesn’t trust vaccine. belief convincing people fence (real anti-vaxxers beyond help) important saving two shots millions. forgor /s lol. think may come like defending parents. everyone able wear mask dont belong flying, even family still wore masks still garbage people going cross country pandemic sehr falsch

aber ich gebe zu, deutschland würde ich den alltag erleben. deshalb bin ich ja raus Can't hide ICU capacity though neckbeard version pollen

M'Lady, let get s'pores Available general public means reserved prioritized delivery case. still mercy amount vaccine able produced distributed. Going Hawaii summer!!!!! Let’s go!!!! M'Lady, S'Pore Yeah, I'm stressed since non-optional plumbing work done weekend. COVID, measles, flu, you. got flu year TDAP booster already lest covered.

I'm grateful live California wont freeze airing house afterwards, can't help stress bit it.

Thanks positive thoughts, need ones get! (Anxiety's trip!!) Oh good. don’t enough crap yet. say death rate .25% US population 300+ million people 300k people died Us alone.

That near 1% exceed next week. US citizen think US getting larger share vaccine. wish didn’t need vaccine desperately idiotic government let Covid run rampant. COVID contact tracer almost done masters public health saying lightly. others mechanisms protect temporarily actually job right. Although hate reward incompetence really don’t know else do. majority Covid deaths world wide(again done LITERALLY anything pandemic playbook would totally different course ignored everything) go somewhere else. sure 

And every day give thanks share country led moderately competent polticans people who, part, selfish dickheads.

This peculiar characteristic unique Australia. countries managed feat. Good luck yours.  find out? they'd give vaccine way without follow-up testing. regularly exposed measles?  Dude, fucking embarrassing Florida 19k deaths given kinds warnings months. Embarrassing criminal.

It's like bunch New Yorkers walked road ended walking cliff, stopped walking road. first warned Florida road told dangerous. instead avoiding road, Floridians kept using 60% many people walked fucking cliff.

And Floridians say ""see! less people walk cliff! win!""

No, really didn't. killed way people have. That's bunk. takes camera, give credit taking it. WH staff wait like rest us, including children.

He's definition evil stupid. dangerous authoritarian. People need get idea extreme hatred. people actually hate him. wish could real President. That's all. doc advise I’m sure. reactions usually mild vaccines- one gave weird bruise hot touch day - left small spot lasted 5 months. Mind reaction black fly bites. allergies bad seafood shellfish react someone cooks - smell. old allergist pretty shocked. Luckily it’s fairly easy avoid. 

I still want get vaccine ASAP, would rather take chance Covid. sure coming correctly, facebook since highschool. trying make argument anything, pointing people may know children small recommended wear masks, staying home safer best bet. first article go children five, children 2 age group singling out. sure hysteria made comments. throwing parents may know Exactly. Sometimes she’s curious wear little I’ll see it’s come off. 

The hard thing try make wear look defeat eyes. them, whatever reason, affects self esteem. She’s little girl. People sub think children mini adults it’s ridiculous.

And sure got lol. UV Mask. Double passive filtration UV active protection Enjoy freedom nice day China also shipping vaccines Middle East Indonesia weeks now. India manufacturing vaccines also.  That's Australian vaccine withdrawn, got nothing BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. concern deciding vaccinate people elder care homes early group - wasn’t tested people age / situation. Like, knows Alzheimer’s patients going react? older, residents weaker stronger side effects? TBD forget it. get disappointing worth stressing over. TV documentaries largely dead good content went streaming YouTube.

There people making great historical series YouTube, especially WWII. certainly agree reason change human society forever Covid, people stupid things get scared. vaccine manditory order attend college work?  get whole dynamic measures system, jump-in sooner one. 
It's btw weird walk around feel nothing going on. plays behind hospital doors. shame everybody gets that. don’t understand uninformed would skeptical. seen plenty shit raise eyebrow.

The trust big pharma government’s role keeping profit motive taking back seat public health totally fucked moment due completely manufactured opioid epidemic, taken life Americans Covid wide margin.

Add cronyism corruption regime American history.

Add guy appointed said corrupt government known handing favors business connections, appointed man 10m stock options Moderna head operation warp speed. announce Moderna front runner.

Then this: mean things matter? hope not, way personally knowing without trust groups poor track record keeping public health number one priority.

I take it, plenty red flags. Correct - size population US. lower trust use vaccine. Huh... that's crazy. address? way americans now. per capita basis absolute negative take humanly possible haha. one points, highly likely vaccines slow transmission, proven yet. vaccines does. terms long terms effects asymptomatic/mild cases, evidence strong long term effcts. evidence back claim think might time spend screens without real social interaction due virus. Really, save lives? There's literature unethical test vaccine pregnant women first trials (and none vaccines have, Pfizer's). CDC says get vaccine pregnant planning pregnancy months passed.  Wow... I'm speechless. 1 1000 dying preventable cause benefit productive majority support. literally Nazis started genocide eliminating sick infirm among Germans. People like hearing completely false. spreading lies cause people die. ICU beds =/= nurses, 5 weeks ago zombie minks Denmark according headlines articles.

My point is, hard really grasp ""worrying"" numbers really are, even show numbers compare previous years. learn history doomed repeat it. USA repeating mistakes anti-mask anti-vaccine bullshit. tell long-term effects taking vaccine: getting coronavirus. Pick toxin. want introduce immune system hardcore version, caught guard time choosing... want take tamed vaccine version, day pick eat right, party much rest well immune system shot fight?

I vaccine minimalist. never flu shot life, optional vaccines turned well. vaccine turning down. live covid epicenter. dodging virus since late January, even called crazy back spring measures taking back then.

But let tell you, novel global pandemic seen kill hospitalize locals 30s, one playing around with! Young people hospitalized, think would make alive. F that. 

1. novel human immune system
2. global
3. kills, kills quickly old news, restrictions already place. update getting anyways Well fair, group people getting new vaccine don’t really need convincing. They’re healthcare workers doctors, they’re necessarily fence whether get not. 

It’s gets general public need convincing. afford wait days year, 1918 pandemic extremely minor footnote global history. far many lessons history *truly learn* gravity without less giving students PTSD. hope mind asking, know long-term issues occur, severity without long-term trial periods? probably ever, spreads way less like asymptomatic rookie numbers, gotta pump up! Nu je het zegt, die schuddebuikjes waren wel lekker hungarian politician time huh? Real-life example Darwinism... *shhhh* quiet, you’ll hurt new normal crew’s self-righteous egos feelings! Yes don’t worry much another study develop antibodies clinical symptoms last 2-3 days, quickly recover, study 130 cats article clearly indicates problem child left unattended. says case required, parent guardian simply nearby supervise.

Your argument would valid throwing bunch masked 2 year-olds plane without supervision, parents right there, instead argument comes baseless hysteria. Stay Facebook. 🏅 wonder someone downvoted asking question. Anyway, ask wrote detailed comment viruses vaccines. writing like experience. know use commas doomed keep using incorrectly. Maybe? pan-pandemicy season 
With hospitalizations cancelled vacations 
When death come call

It's pan-pandemicy season 
There'll lockdown restrictions posting 
Marshmallows toasting 
And ambulences snow 
There'll scary ghost stories 
And tales plagues 
Christmases long, long ago look death statistics, numbers people 50 insignificant comparison. /r/ExplainTheJoke  understand this, ""turned off"" development timeline, least. long term data human subjects simply (and can't be) yet. funding resources can't solve issue. time can. probably lives world isnt reason doubt vaccine therefore ‘cutting line’ isnt sketchy. reason want take trust works absolutely confident product wouldnt feel need put people ease doubt people keep wearing masks partying summer 2021 term coined researchers demographers use. public using it. take time, nobody saying doesn’t. knowingly withholding information. 

I provide examples day.

What fact China sat genome week 3 different labs information.

It lab mistakenly released January 11 website acknowledged it.

Theres blatant corruption China, clearly holding back information start, providing misleading information WHO. Nah. 2022 fully normal. probably mean spring summer. HMIC: Head Moron Charge got sent school bronchitis laryngitis time, talk school required stay home that. Huh? Obviously know someone suffer longterm not. That's point. novel virus repeatedly surprised medical community. I'd assume, minimum, young people getting lung transplants going live normal life. 95% effective vaccine. someone say ""stopping spread - - goal"" ridiculous. goal absolutely herd immunity prevent suffering risk levels Herd immunity magical threshold hit, suddenly there's outbreaks. There's still risk spread. There's ton unknown challenges we're going face even vaccine widely available.. vaccine hesitancy, different strains disease, vaccine effectiveness time, etc.

There still outbreaks challenges even vaccine available everyone. Things normalize, it'll take time. Hopefully practical impacts lives (like masks, social distancing, gathering limitations) targeted point based community needs. NY 150k - 200k tests per day. Well ahead fucking Florida. Florida hits 100k tests big day. That's good idea. People getting passes wearing masks public - okay, show vaccinated.  Social media reason people divided.

and guns kill people, people kill people...

No, unregulated social forums manipulative algorithms capitalistic data-harvesting driven companies backed corrupt obsolete politicians reason people divided. side red vs. blue team politics, centuries misogynistic ideologies, racial segregation, intergenerational emotion abuse. I’d love see running vaccination count news networks caption “path herd immunity.” unless actually like mother-in-law case

[OMG ADMIT    Yea, really think going lot people get first shot. 

We already know good amount people fence. anti-vaxxers, regular people often see make comments trusting ""fast tracked"" vaccine. believe people fence get vaccine. many them, already hesitant, experience expected side effects decide get second shot? whole cancer argument done. Unless smoker deliberately trying get cancer, talking infectious disease currently deployed vaccine masses. argument hospitals get overrun flu bit exaggeration. see large scale hospital overruns like seeing covid. also flu terms impact people. much worse extent average hospital stay long covid.  I’m arguing extended lockdowns. I’m arguing data determine restrictions lifted. acknowledge seriousness situation vaccine rushed I'm hesitant get it.  quote needing restrictions second half 2021 article. disagree Fauci said article? 18% ""will get it"" responses region, good intentions vs. actually it... headline Nothing more. that.

Millions people saw heard Kamala Harris. Especially black community.

People die statement. probably take said baby aircraft, closed recirculated air shared hundred strangers traveling country. shorthand gender neutral term Jfc reddit It’s based arguments deal regularly fam die hard Right. first thought virus joke dems leverage win. didn’t mask regularly, servers family members hospital virus. It’s year pure frustration; mom legit hospital right went dinner party large group people. smoked life denied issue. I’m sitting dad verge death cancer mom ventilator ICU. Also Covid cause grandpa stroke, hard anti masker well. tried warn them. recently rewatched movie, best ending ever really. bad made shitty show, much potential mean Australian public yes. clear that, bad He's already done something better. Announce ethical committee decide get first, execs candidates skip line.  name movie scouts zombie strip club? kind want watch Yeah, fact anti-vaxx gained actual traction past months really scares vaccine rollout. 

Antivaxxers always here, even back 1918 Spanish Flu. problem talk organize easily via Social Media. really wish sites would start policing zero-tollerance.

We see immunity years, hope right peter out. Here's hoping!! Stay safe! Already it. risk group. people gobble vaccine hesitation. luxury serve test subject ""Insert pedophile joke here"" sad wedding, also can't stop thinking high school college students missing big milestones. can't imagine frustrating would be. get go, amazing, good thing take granted! That’s real poor analysis threat covid. it’s deadly young people doesn’t mean it’s deadly. frankly, death one outcomes many here.  35% people exhibit form symptoms going long covid regardless age. don’t get really know cases resolve long term. It’s really amazing people think governments imposing restrictions reason control people. fact arrived point pretty pathetic. healthcare workers exhausted message basically gigantic “fuck you, job”. hoping even good news, developments occur speed even timeline. production capacity essentially. seems like question could answered question have. Thoughts. 2.9 mil getting next delivery 2.9M pfizer vaccine expected 3 weeks - that'd January. would still people, getting second dose. Moderna able make difference vaccinate 20mil. So, I'm *guessing* shipments 3 weeks, can't find *any* news talking that. 

I find estimate pfizer moderna together could producing total 5-10M doses/week starting Jan. sure total production capacity amount allocated USA. Vietcong day? Boy print even begin respond. take would unhappy government matter did. propose? Stand watch millions die? think government done nothing? Industries would died anyway. Sweden better approach. 

Personally, feel like surrendering rights, believe views rights backwards. born rights, rights given us whoever charge. job, government insurgents controlling neighborhood, decides rights have. I'll also add going concert covered freedom assembly. 

Additionally, lot lockdowns worse need decisions people make. idea Americans trusted make good decisions flat wrong. People denying masks, taking zero precaution straight denying science dangerous time like this. Sure, question everything, maybe open idea government scientists whoever might correct one. 

I'll continue brow beat much want, right all. efforts us sacrificing decimated people screaming rights coughing people's faces. Someday pandemic history books, want side gave fuck fellow man woman. think would surprised much disinformation existed Spanish Flu. Sure able mainline disinformation now, one thing find common thread idiocy. initial assumption types events would tests checked carefully everyone somehow think that's case.

Only orgy join one STD tests visible. get coming twin toddlers total opposites. One wants like Dad voluntarily wears mask about, voluntarily worn Mom going store. turned three. There's way could force wear mask. That's rarely take stores. mean? course first take it. Ye fr, bad, really post good faith promise Yeah. even would take it, fuck them. Protect people want protected. Let kill other.  Would surprised hit number again. Ok, 2 years old, even shows drastic change 2015-2018. Show 2020 one. think grand scheme things CEO taking really matter. Usually CEO's involved day day operations projects company. people actually made vaccine, independent organizations vetting vaccine, hundreds thousands people clinical trails past year already took enough me. 

The people worry PR huge corporation matter more. Cause announces takes bad press either way. lose/lose situation put much thought it. times rich CEO letting world know took vaccine pretty much nobody get right good look too.  self delusion blatant disregard moral values

politician Everyone getting fuck out. Already lost least 4% population. pretty terrible right now. I'm honestly little put talk restrictions without talk assistance. we're expected ""do part"" government needs theirs. lose job again, want hear anything another lockdown hear something another stimulus check (and yes, know state government thing, realistic.) Baker care working class really bother me. Right, let's give privilege getting first doses Native Americans. I’ll gladly get vaccine protect others, I’m little concerned Fauci saying here. 

He said fall approach “some form normality”. mean still need wear mask times? so, that’s true normality. 

Experts said “until vaccine” “until herd immunity reached”. there’s another goalpost change. I’m starting think new normal don’t want happen. weird take, mind. 

On one hand, virus, shown ability show acute respiratory harm healthy, young people. Sure, young, healthy people die, get scarred lungs. And, like vaccine, studying virus 10 months. hand, vaccine test nearly long we've studying virus, shows long term effects. 

Why would afraid vaccine virus? We'll waiting US trial vaccine finish US approval. definitely behaving poorly, complied immediately left plane asked. Talking back arguing continuing put others risk prolonging time child unmasked, well father allowing mask slip nose.

Also, although could mistaken, impression HEPA air filters lauded making flying safe begin go effect plane starts moving. means imperative passengers prepared take-off soon possible. point flight, maximizing risk risky time so. 94 year old grandma getting vaccinated next week. She’s isolation since March looking forward seeing family again. We’ll see reacts vaccine. dad delivering vitamins probiotics past 9 months hopefully ok.  antibodies vacs :) also heard that, currently 50% US population plans get vaccine first availability, 25% sure, 25% say won’t. frontline healthcare job long enough period time, pandemic not, eventually detach patient lose sense emotional attachment them. live, that’s awesome. die, sucks. Either way, forget within week.

I guess say applies good 90+% us. rest develop PTSD sort substance abuse issue. know want vaccinate 100 million people end February approximately 20-25 million people per month USA Yes, recommended vaccines. Well 3 kinda people here.

The normal pro vaccine people.

The nut job never vaccinate sorta people 

And rest, would gladly get vaccine want one due quickly came fear negative effects. I’m guessing sports concerts come back next year despite risk. agree. would certainly good longer-term solution state solvency.  conservative media pumping misinformation straight veins cult 24x7, even exist back then. lmao Get doctor prescribe double build medication backups!

One meds $1200/month, lose health insurance I'll enough saved waiting generic released (it's patent month finally!)  break fast?? hospitals verge collapsing. even near full..Things could change weeks speculation right now.  Aw man. know wanted go convention too. personally think really hasty decision part. \-5 Riverside county ICU 0% . Hospitalizations right nearly double summer surge. 

The 7 day average cases triple summer surge, hit number recently. case growth still exponential (nearly vertical line since weeks ago). signs plateau. hospitalizations continue pick weeks come something drastic happen. 

Overall, compliance county abysmal. stay home order place, virtually businesses open (old navy, bed bath beyond, tons stores put badge ""essential business""). Mask compliance relatively high businesses, that's case since June. 

Not areas CA bad, January death numbers grim. Yup, us, enjoy ICU Honestly probably dudes (not there's anything wrong that). think taking would change minds people believe vaccines. also think many people believe need see taking enforce beliefs. might make small sub set people sway think majority people set ways make huge impact. “Adequate caution” - mean you? 

Are immunologist? studied produced vaccines and/or novel viruses career, decades medical education belt? 

The Spanish Flu took 675,000 American lives. America track 500,000 deaths March 2021. significant you, even ratios different? It’s 100 years, medicine different beast 1918, yet people dropping like flies regardless. Sure, death rate isn’t high *yet*, pandemic far over, especially USA - factoring advanced medical care 2020, bet left testicle/tittie Spanish Flu isn’t “much higher”. “Higher”, maybe, we’ll see - “much higher”. 

There literally isn’t caution could possibly take listening exactly experts, combined centuries man-hours work topic belt, say do. Literally none. paywalls rightfully (but uninformed) skeptical. take road it’s available. 

I kinda resent attitude given vaccine question. Yes 5g Bill Gates type nutjobs far anti-vax, even got flu shot weeks ago, taking iteration covid vaccine doctors allow to. cdc semi-reversed guidelines vaccine allergies multiple cases anaphylaxis individuals history allergies vaccines causing say vaccine given individuals. they're saying talk doctor allergies decide worth risk monitored time receiving dose case anaphylaxis. attitude benadryl, epinephrine, solumedrol fix anaphylaxis among public simply true, although work cases. 

That's also neglecting things like concern rapidly ascending paralysis susceptible autoimmune conditions potentially adverse response. Yes, understand history transverse myelitis rare, they've already case vaccine reasonably dont want paralyzed again. Yes, paralysis always rare risk vaccines (like 1 3 million something like that), appears current covid vaccine likely particularly prone given shown induce immune responses, covid related myelinopathies, someone already TM attack trial. want become paralyzed again.

I've hospitalized severe allergic reaction/mild anaphylaxis (I consider true anaphylaxis require severe hypotension bare minimum, bp got like 96 systolic), chronic autoimmune problems notable, history autoimmune related paralysis. ain't putting vaccine me, I'll happy enough healthy individuals take help create herd immunity. 

**tldr:** plenty reasons non-whackadoos would avoid vaccine. I'm anti-vax cant get vaccine, people legitimate concerns may minority, still exist abundant may realize. vaccine ain't walk park. wife works long-term care setting that's 75% converted positive COVID patients they're finding ""many healthcare folks want already"". They've got issues across facilities(100+) nurses/CNAs wanting vaccine think CEO taking make much worse. 

Is husband really seeing people clamoring vaccine? think showed humanity horrible? true. Strep throat, want reliable results go nose right back end. pretty uncomfortable.

Also, kid goes rampage cant understand tolerate something ""happen body"" appears dangerous, receptive logical arguments.

i guess dont kids own? Ohh lookie lookie here, boys. got Mr. Know-it-all here. guy room knows better everyone else. believe Eisenhower said thing chance. Wow, sometimes Reddit extremely daft. 
What say completely true line CDC says. 
(Side note: long ago stopped paying attention masking since March practicing isolation.) 
What crazy though go say “unable wear mask doesn’t mean everyone else gets put risk.” 

So, state something a) true (children aged two recommended wear mask) b) empathetic (under two year old shouldn’t situation potentially infect others) get lit it. Conspiracy much? can't seriously true. like kind mentality ensure person charge makes sure product works expected :D

Thank you! hope day improved :) vaccine going destributed globaly? Seasonality plays role. Ugh New Zealand sees 4 million tourists one year. Heathrow, one airport UK, sees one week.

Heathrow sees far less traffic that. 4 million/wk, would getting close double busiest (by passengers) airport world. Auckland airport course lower numbers, quarter Heathrow's. half dose section really confusing.

So thought Italian produced vaccine double strength, halved that, later realise italian produced one actually double strength, ended half dose? insist error made? Borders closed. tried Saran Wrap? people know able get vaccine? free dom? that. New Zealand Australia also MUCH lower population density U.K. brought Twitter someone tried debunk “well populations aren’t spread evenly” 1) densities countries’ biggest cities like Auckland Sydney smaller London 2) cities NZ Australia isolated whereas England’s biggest cities aren’t London Birmingham close together North. north south divide covid data U.K. even NZ AUS locally locked densest cities countries (Auckland Melbourne).

That shows population density much factor island status, much kind anti vaxxer would convinced CEO Pfizer getting vaccine? real question be: politicians do, mask mandates/social distancing/limited # people 1k daily deaths? 500?, 250? 100? Fair enough. 

I hastily mistook comment one different type spread kinds people (here US) also advocate civil war believe planet flat. Obviously we’re going compare statistics need agreed-upon metrics. premise vaccinating ""vectors"" briefly entertained thought unethical vaccinate young healthy irresponsible people 'at risk' even though paper vaccinating likely spread may actually end pandemic faster.

Source: Straight ass. ethics vaccinating young “irresponsible” people nothing it. Pfizer trial didn’t track whether vaccinated person could still spread virus. tracked whether vaccinated person ended severe covid (in hospital dead).

So vaccinating goal cutting transmission vector might completely worthless. don’t data yet. time it’s available everyone would given 10s millions people around world. yall's lives finally able get back normal. Grats. Plus, that's overall rate. elderly disabled, survival rate 99% all. Yeah possibly, drill whether discrepancies staffing levels actively note major resistance. terms propensity trust vaccine, reality put stock doctors think front-line RNAs PSWs. Though again, may Canadian thing... know U.S. there's weird kind anti-intellectualism lot people put *less* faith source expert are. hope right ""reasonable disagreement"". thought politics polarizing thing world comes monkey driven rocket car. think lot people said lot things can't taken back. would upset. already lot discussion wanting rich people cutting line this. Half many FAR.

I wish countries would pursue elimination strategy like NZ Aus Count ""let's see drop dead"" camp since called ""variant"" mean notable means tracing spread significantly affect sensitivity recently approved vaccine? need least 70% population vaccinated create herd immunity people can't vaccinated whatever medical reason straight die. 

Not mention that, people get infected, higher chance mutating making current vaccine utterly useless. could also potentially make lethal younger people. 

Oh coronavirus made 4 million previously healthy Americans permanently disabled. That's 1 50 Americans rely Social Security disability income. struggling support retiring boomers Social Security. gonna able support people without completely collapsing? 

Vaccinating people super important different factors play. tip iceberg. ""We knew fool world long, needed get shut government less people cared whole coronavirus thing. supposed do? profit? capitalize expense life stupid grandma? ancient. good run. economy must go on.""

- Disney, assume Yes That’s fair. keep mind poll mentioned asked 600 people. number could different time comes Yes. bad, said 100% sure. 3 weeks came looked way remembered phrased ""at least x amount time second dose"" meaning second dose definite past due date

Also thie person responded say they're from, mention US I'm sure referring one specific country comment others mention US particular cannot keep world shutdown forever due possibility injury death. lived risk 2020. again. individuals decide they’re willing risk right people already powder keg. cannot keep kind non-living going. Eventually death preferable living bubble wrapped, socializing fun outlet allowed. It’s getting much. cannot continue vaccines widely available. Great news. Operation Warp Speed showing success. Conspiracy much? trust govt experts. globally. know best public, trust best get us thru crisis. start doubting one part plan, whole plan might well mistrusted, want that. need people believe know best. Without gotten vaccine ffs. herd inmunity switch covid gone, gradual thing lasts months Sputnik 5 (Russian vaccine), Sinovac Sinopharm vaccines approved EUA home countries, approved countries January.

Not US EU, then, world pretty big place need vaccine. Anti-vaxxers new normal crew form alliance. axis dense. Something something fake something saline something water can’t wait get Bill Gates’ microchip. *I mean vaccine* arresting lead death.

Yeah, kill bunch old people, know disposable anyways agree mind controlled microchips.  I'm talking people 40's, 50's, 60's. people 40. saying don’t trust since he’s getting tons us happy get instead. asthma. can’t go safely, can’t work public, can’t volenteer hospital wearing mask make breathless...I likely covid, recent. sprint soon get vaccine, don’t want one awful machines read science trust it

this guy right, frontline workers need  remember correctly, Johnson-Johnson vaccine also one-shot? save rest Ironically, think Bill Cosby. besides hopefully acceptance WFH, nothing ""new normal"" call even remotely appealing.

I can't wait able fully socialize friends family know people world can't wait either. explains vaccine made. rushed. ton people already studying corona viruses mRNA vaccines. multiple steps time like overlapping phase one phase two trials started manufacturing early on. thing rushed paperwork scientists working nights weekends this. works company created it, would expect come benefit first. feel like taking care people help make possible i'm mad that. Good what? 59 belongs risk group. knows really get vaccine. But, CEO actual company made it? one person. random celebrity...  looks like trust it, know. Upvoted noticed too, dicknose annoying. thought English language thing also, expressed dislike Spanish-speaker, feel work spoken language. (I usually get called transphobe immediately saying this).

However, past week read Spanish publication used words ""frustradx incomodx."" 🤔 ¿cómo pronunció eso??

Anyway, asked someone told pronounced ""frustrade.""

So write ""frustrado(a/e)?"" that's interesting username got there. vaccinating people 90's really good use resources? 

They're likely need ICU bed get virus. 

Most heathy 23 year olds stay home get it. statement true. Politicians would done lot people country live in. Dont forget customer service too. late deliveries blatant disregard prime commitments norm struggle even contact issues. companies reduced annual fees best maintain continue raise prices without adding value. It’s days ago depends lessons learn history. Take example Thalidomide marketed specifically pregnant women cure morning sickness released without thorough testing. don’t want make comparison vaccine, see people use logic make comparison. easy say learn history everything specific complications makes difficult apply completely different situation current one. taking Vaccine advise everyone stay skeptical make informed decision matters blindly apply historic events current situation. show annoying stop watching it. course take vaccine. People, look this! Eh? read 3 weeks, 8. Fauci seems think it'll widely available end March. Considering amount people already ignoring social distancing recommendations evidenced explosion cases deaths, imagine sentiment nothing rationalization most. many countries better USA fight Covid. countries deserved vaccine them. here... like.. maybe wait month two see..  this, think I'll wait Oxford instead. Sigh...let preface I'm say letting know I'm vet well, said...

Is vaccinating people 90's really good use resources? I'm really trying insensitive people many decades ahead vs someone well...not long world, discussion needs happen. video edited first trying put surgical type mask child, suddenly father wearing surgical mask daughter gaiter around father holding way big her. addition father nose dick showing surgical mask argued virus 99.9% survivable couple doesn’t take restriction seriously.

I’m parent normally would sympathize parents except taking virus seriously obviously didn’t prepare daughter flight. fact flown summer demonstrates opportunities prepare her. One question have: child banned life parents? can’t see child banned life something parents responsible for. brother law said doesn’t believe vaccine never get it. also doesn’t get flu shot. said putting poison body. told I’m 71 years old vaccinated types illnesses. it’s turn vaccine definitely get it. Lol meant sounds difficult 3 year olds give shit rules. think effort mask good idea. virus nasty nasty. I've read discussed business circles December. expats China heard November. Sharlot, director communications health department, said order go effect Tuesday last Dec. 23. Procedures knee replacements colonoscopies among delayed, things cancer treatments trauma surgery data health department, least 300 patients confirmed ICU beds across state Wednesday. Jackson metro area, Dobbs stated bed availability intensive care patients several weeks. Yes, provided medical exceptions cannot get due medical reasons. think would better risk getting virus side effects risk potential vaccine side effects shown clinical trials tens thousands patients. Hmmm. Air Canada teaming Manulife provide free covid travel insurance capped 21 days 200k coverage, useful snowbirds Yeah unfortunately lose lose verge collapse. links. May post please. collages least require influenza? hope schools require unless medical reason. Still don’t enjoy it. still wear one. get useful data asymptomatic infections. [The efficacy numbers published include asymptomatic primary efficacy analysis included **symptomatic COVID-19** seronegative participants nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab 14 days second dose vaccine.

They include couple numbers efficacy asymptomatic infections, they're worthless (confidence intervals generally running negative 50% positive 50%) due extremely small sample sizes. report low-dose/standard-dose regimen asymptomatic efficacy high 50s, but, again, that's worthless 95% confidence interval 1% 82.9%.

So, agree would nice measure. ultimately impact know right now, numbers vaccines based symptomatic infections, thus comparable least regard. (The difference Astrazeneca count someone symptomatic reported symptoms *after* positive test result--those folks went asymptomatic pile.) don’t think it’s learning it, it’s living it. 

This wonderful way putting it, thank perspective. Horribly stupid take. Didn’t know widespread beginning. information came in. Opinions changed. That’s proper science. Anti-maskers refusing wear masks point myriad stupid reasons come adjusting guidelines based new data. sold countries. He's still effectively cashier simplify things. here! also work kitchen. I'm sorry losses. hard lose resident -- really like family. thats get socialist health care, lawl Dude same!! someone would upset I'd apologize, someone else tells ignore first person bad, say: important!! nightmares replaced work nightmares. Exactly. Charges manslaughter warranted. Right saying considered social pariah choices completely disagree. choose racist choose sexist choose murderer choose put people risk choosing get vaccine absolutely social pariah. Hospice social worker here, also rural Missouri. patients son tell vaccine government control contains 12 week Caucasian male babies changes persons DNA. said tried baby afterwards, it'll likely come different race. fuck doctors understand - cannot get herd immunity something constantly evolving! can't get rid common flu exactly reason, seasonal virus mutates spreads. Fuck sake! logic wear masks forever then? unlikely virus eradicated good, least long time. What’s wrong stupid? vaccine Santa Claus, ""reward"" good entire year. supposed end pandemic, yes, means stopping spread. 

If scientific standpoint, come conclusion vaccinating super spreaders best step ending pandemic, that's route choose. Yeah dentist one places I’ve felt comfortable going since March.  Note, new it’s also “outside body” folks understand accurately. 'Cut line'? Give break 2018 - - - really paid attention news year. see large scale hospital issues almost every single year due flu. Saying Covid presenting new problem hospitals capacity issues exaggeration. fact, hospitals lower capacity time year historically been. used hospital capacity metric shutting annual basis, communities would shut every year. 

You absolutely arguing extended shut downs. subreddit it. audacity claim relying data. using hospital capacity metric original justification this, lockdowns ending soon. Instead you, others want go ever using ever changing definition data important. he’s disgusting? Ok cool. Thanks Russia Problem would timing. It’s like get money bank account week give unemployed. 13 people waiting ICU bed network.

Wait.

""What, Spanish Flu?"" know 30 years point absolutely know short term effects Corona virus choices something protects something know short-term whereas getting virus getting vaccine unknown long terms (though given contents vaccine guess long-term effects mild nothing).

Basically take educated guess scientists educated guests non-scientists like same. Well, point view topic officially changed towards Canada. Santeria. I'll see hell. Gmail down, sorry get message would say much know health care lacking. 

I think pandemic change alot though. Lowering taxes bigger focus politicians. surge COVID-19 cases Mississippi left intensive care unit beds available across state prompted need restrictions 

Nothing like waiting already shit pants start looking bathroom. Yupp!! literally prime agreement. anymore. complete bullshit prioritizing essential items back march? Nope, used excuse items took week guaranteed 2 day. 

I asked multiple times term guaranteed means. give answer. Yep, hospitals verge collapsing. Exactly. vaccine already there. bloody don’t get it. I’m South America isolated fuck there’s hope vaccine. 

I’m pretty much one taking seriously among friends. good test run secession. family going take vaccine apparently Bill Gates(?). reality pandemic ever reason created huge amount people fall victim conspiratorial thinking. recent polling I've seen shows 42% Americans willing take vaccine. title real I'm happy it. One mods removed post indicated hospitals trouble. Wtf? happening. Okay, right, get it. safe assume can’t things like see family/friends go big events eat restaurant till 2022? That’s it’s starting look like. haven’t felt hopeless since March. forgot 3. Corporations governments reasons lie you, histories prove qualms so. Oh no! Yes, definitely happening US.

Hogwash! like Listers work never happened!!  Pretty sure important select people get publicly show support. goes leader trying show population commitment benefits. giving bunch super rich people overcharging different story There's probably high chance people going first people list vaccine. Thus, time people offered vaccine ones risk hospitalisation (75 overs) already vaccine. everyone stay living fear chance indirectly killing someone virus low? Life continue point, year misery time vaccines widely available all. Dear goodness. Latin ethnicity. Latins cultures/areas derived Roman Empire.

Perfection. know graph 9/11 shows age groups pretty well. get elderly taken care things get normal pretty quick. Depends variant. Sequences viral proteins critical function don’t tend change, spike protein vaccines targeting. think variances used track regional outbreaks, tool contact tracing simply mutation rate isn’t high enough.

Ask 10-30 years. also top 5 population sizes. risk group literally 100 million, population countries. didn’t say new. said don’t data back Pfizer vaccine, we’re vaccinating at-risk groups. Again, ethics irresponsibility nothing it. definitely everyone's experience though. Staying school extra year going fix either (assuming happen). increase amount financial aid (likely) take due college 5 years instead 4. Fortunately Pfizer indemnity, nothing worry about. cannabis plants, lol. country? 

No one really full lockdown. lot travel, lot markets enforcing mask wearing, half assed. least cali. Living near Memphis, would go live music lot, stopped I’ve sober two years.. can’t wait go back let wife drink listen music. I’ll enjoy hell club soda. Either way expect tell truth bother Heard immunity basically tipping point virus longer spread wacky rates. hit like 60% immunity virus half amount people infect, less half infections means growth rate starts shrink zero. 

To get true heard immunity virus cant jump sick person healthy person, virus dies host, gotta like 95% immunity...we aint gonna get while. 

Ive got clue level thing “normal” im sure stuff roll back summer. stuff come back masks, stuff wont back till 2022 im sure. Trump literally threatened fire head FDA get vaccine approved Friday instead day two later. Now, every state borders Mississippi going pressure take overflow ICU patients. Mississippi get act together. variant virus slightly different RNA sequence, behaves exactly same. Imagine clone person, except eyes brown instead blue. Slightly different nothing would affect behavior.

A strain virus behaves differently. example clone 3 arms two heads. question us is, new strain different vaccine work it? far, seem like has, know future. Currently, vaccine targets spike protein coronavirus attack. spike protein changes, vaccine probably work. However, good thing targeting spike protein spike protein changes drastically, could affect ability infect cells means die off. Hopefully. It’s fault. Toxic people here. full heartedly believe government protect them. I’m cool assholes getting treatment dumb assholes. How’s saying go winning stupid prizes again? There's way hell kid would worn mask 2. Like, 0% chance, unless sleeping. said, would known better take plane ffs Lol “when time comes” isn’t vote confidence. Hey, want millions people take front I’ll take while. really, I’m confident.

If confident would’ve first line take show it’s safe. want go strip club. worked stuff, good technology long living tissue exposed it. bad eyes especially. get hes trying seem fair man take vaccine protect yourself. CEO neither essential worker. Nazi zombie alien vampire bounty hunters imperfect solution written part many perceive problem Spanish language. opinion, creates problem soon try pronounce written. Reading 'x' 'e' something I'm willing do. want read 'Latine', better write 'Latine'. I'll glad adopt gender neutral ending, e, write something cannot pronounced. rushed. still considered experimental. Furthermore, U.S. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program cover Covid-19 vaccine emergency period Oct-1-2024; date may extended. details found U.S. PREP Act. inspire much confidence...

Why U.S. government fully cover injury liability like vaccines. That's critical question ask, should.

The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program cover vaccines. However, provides relatively little compensation, difficult pursue case, various attorney fees legal costs covered.

Personally, I'd like get vaccinated sooner later, lack full injury compensation protection concerning. heard peak NJ testing staff even showing symptoms staff work thought many people sick. J&amp;J cut enrollment requirements 60k 40k results end Dec/Jan. faster get approved vaccines faster return normalcy. Clear willing follow guidelines. ones lobbying creating reasons perform surgeries treatments. opinion incredibly neglegent. 

On another note, kind person would refuse save child could? say people? demand societies highest degrees respect, what? harm include anything watching harm play out? Doctors able perform duties field hospitals 25lbs Kevlar docs hospitals scared flu common symptoms symptoms? too. try shop places treat customers employees better. like Aldi local shops. Since don’t options delivery using Amazon year due quarantine. don’t like treat employees though. Good-faith question: ICU capacity peak flu season normal year? (i honestly idea) ""Nah fam, go first."" Stuck inside probably not. Masks might continue prevent resurgence. get sarcasm. world, everyone deserves saved, matter big asshole someone is. :) What’s Fauci’s agenda? Isn’t still effectively CEO —So cashing either way. people 51-64? considered general population Two weeks nothing all. countries implemented full lockdowns big wave go much longer two weeks, like two months.

Also, one proper lockdown enough everything goes back normal afterwards. country lockdown spring crushed wave, praised one best covid success stories world. Today we're one worst. Wtf sounds much like baseless claim.
Frist time hearing im reading news daily Looks like lord Fauci finally getting tired safety theatre. multi-level comedic. imagine billionaire ceo caring much common folk gives away 1 (one) extra vaccine millions he’s virtuous. assure biggest laugh life rich friends drinking expensive scotch fucking hookers (no one wearing mask) made statement 
Your 42% number fake. better said, provide source. think there’s meets eye. Large Fortune 500 companies, especially company like Pfizer, contingency plans senior level executives. 

The CEO getting vaccine yet means company elevated risk event contracts covid dies.

The fact Pfizer CEO willing take risk instead getting vaccinated speaks volumes vaccine.

I’ll happily stand back line wait everyone else get vaccine role sleeve I'd say reason hypothesis dead end data information needed verify claims currently obtainable. would different story international transparency matter. fact impossible test hypothesis without international pressure seems. we've seen undue blame pandemic tossed nation dare question narrative history deception. 

So far U.S., Italy, Spain India (thus far) implicated originating point pandemic forced abrupt closure city 11 million people (and much country time). whole pandemic wishful thinking hoping best many, *many* aspects SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic whole. hypothesis hard test necessarily mean abandoned. made appointment vaccine! Okay but...

This pandemic living. reasonable ‘means end’ (realistically) vaccine. vaccine here. Regardless timeline best news EVER going get regarding Covid. What’s alternative?  vote confidence bigger statement 

He given vote confidence take time comes. I'm taking vaccine Trump administration filth offices leading country.... Biden's team goes ensures everything actually fucking safe, take it. 

This first time Trump said something pandemic actually ""true"" - vaccine end year. deeply unsettling, tells truth part bigger lie. needed study this?


That's limiting non essential things important. Bars, gyms, restaurants, etc...


People need roof heads, ability work, aquire groceries, etc.. need go sit nonessential bar, restaurant, gym, presence complete strangers pick Covid bring back essential places lives spread everyone else. places get free testing done?  works company created it, would expect come benefit first. 

Wtf think cronyism nepotism determine gets vaccine rather need? Holy shit. comments? describing natural selection runs one largest philanthropic organizations world, donated billion dollars help stop virus. obviously advisers know they’re talking keep informed, y’know, he’s pretty smart guy himself. Yeah bad PR move. thinking? doctors politicians agendas feel unwilling use product red flag?

I hear you. hope one know affected don’t experience that. It’s like constant state unease anxiety doesn’t end. parents COPD mother heart failure, feel like I’m literally warding deaths don’t let guard down. 

I’ll glad actually chill. honestly don’t know I’ll - feel like I’ll still stuck constant edge-of-my-seat feeling know let go.

Hence cashier remark...implying without ""cashier"" line wait in. incredibly disrespectful 1%. everyone america got it, 1% fatal, that's 3.2 million people. wild see numbers stay (relatively) low. see plenty mask use stores Broward, bars front house take zero precautions. wonder total resident numbers skewed snowbirds actually state year? idea research that.

Now, rant ""freedumbs"" Need Canadian border open move start new job!! CEO could theoretically risk health meant boosting company securing position. It’d reliable groundhog’s day.  I’m wishing death them. I’m confident able fight naturally unlike us weak folks rely vaccine Tbfh im promote covid real wear masks social distancing, pro vaccines entire life, ceo taking made feel much weary im even sure id take anymore Oh yea maybe! like viewpoint, clever insane many soft anti vaccine people thread. He's making right decision here, mind. vaccine gone thousands volunteers, need proof concept rich person prioritizing safety general public.  Yes, I'm aware anti-vaxxers dumb.

That's pointing conclusions wrong explaining hes hesitant take it. Using approximation (7000 subscribers)/(16 million US cases) gives 0.05%.

That said, bad way looking plural anecdote data, sub collection anecdotes. Agree 100%. one would asked hadn’t announced it.  like bulletproof glass CEO literally stood behind product Children would make better headline, opinion. Sends nurturing tone. 

Vaccinates older parents could live experiment. get eventually, think enough people tested seen effects it. 

How many people that?

Clinical trials tons volunteers, way drugs. Expecting someone work CEO. refused wear shoes, would happen? think you’d eventually figure way get wear them, wearing shoes common expectation. NAZI ALIENS DROVE ICE ROADS SECRET LAYER OAK ISLAND


COULD BEEEE Dude needs [eat dog wear mask ya big baby hate tell yall this, really good thing. isnt front line. isnt nursing home. doesnt get vaccine matter is. 

Soon elderly risk would due. turn It’s proven Florida’s numbers suppressed government political gain. So....I certainly wouldn’t use numbers probably already caught it. I'm still holding reported ""penis enlargement"" side effect... get eventually, think enough people tested seen effects it. I’m risk, don’t job requires come contact lot people. I’m generally pretty safe. Let people world risk greatest reward risk I'll take ""Shit Total Fucking Lie"" $600, Alex. ... fuck dude.

They’re overworked. Doctors moved many states help covid overflow.

You don’t want doctor who’s potentially infected someone else operating child compromised immune system.

Blame politicians anti maskers who’ve forced us control spiral, people dealing exhausted fallout. Thanks rational here. think absolutely fair suspicious CEO big pharma company, Pfizer nonetheless, getting vaccine available. doesnt mean youre crazy antivaxxer. also skeptical vaccine much interested gene therapy, biotech, etc totally support development technologies well support vaccine stop pandemic eventually allow us return normal life. certainly lot unknowns brand new type vaccine developed short time scale. hate people lump people like us obvious crazy nutters. 100% pro vaccine pro-science, time tell one shall see happens. also wish people would wear masks properly social distance properly vaccine isnt mass amounts yet, meanwhile cases spiking, hospitals completely overwhelmed, still people walking around saying virus completely fake. human race never ceases amaze me, completely wrong ways. *sigh* doesn’t matter does. Idiots going believe whatever theory want. They’ll claim shot saline something. No, it’s completely safe. you’re spreading misinformation. actually seen one people change minds? I’m trying hard family seems totally hopeless. refusal take 

He refused take all. plans taking time everyone else. 

Spreading misinformation like dangerous irresponsible. Thats good know. worried unethical people say vaccine gone bad sell side Didn’t already ditch there? Oxford/Sputnik mix trials confirm West. thought Operation Warp Speed officials via dashboard created. 60 Minutes. Dr. Fauci (literally PERSON world trust this) ""I'll get it""

People ""do trust""

CEO company ""I'll get I'll wait appropriate risk group take dose away someone whose life save""

People ""(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"" may reading wrong since english first language wife one pregnant OB doctor saying also wait get vaccinated? BS Yup, I’d say would better cut line avoid whole conspiracy. Two doses would well worth it. That's selfish super spreader talk. I’m sick tired left-wing horseshit plaguing fucking website.

I’m straight ticket Republican lost vote. English bulldog would better job office much love he’s dumber box rocks Yeah, you’re going take vaccine regardless guy does. people skeptical ones needs convince take it. Work busy emergency department, first test I’m symptomatic (loss taste/smell). temperature screening/self monitor symptoms otherwise. 100% get vaccine soon can?

What mean due diligence? experts declared vaccine safe possibly know point. think due diligence? words, first bat viruses jumped humans variant, one made human human jump became strain.

Is basic idea? you’re nut. Truly. people lived Spanish Flu don’t remember it. little children. amount people remember anything Spanish Flu first hand could probably count one hand.  sounds like you’re throwing links wall see sticks. trying use first article, mentions “lingering fatigue” conflating “Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” mentioned second article. Lingering Fatigue CFS. first article clearly states fatigue numbers indicate people CFS, second article saying worried about. 

So, anything suggesting 30% cases leading severe disability? reading articles carefully reveals aren’t supporting claim. missing? Doctor gates you!!!

Banning temporarily working escalated improve profit. Why? develop vaccine contact lot people. He's even 

Because people care public perception reality. they'll trust pharma executive?



Who trust more? pharma executive taking company's product vs one doesn't? article affirm all, fact goes way opposite.



You know well read articles, headlines. Actually believe 50% 100% effectiveness need stop virus. lower effectiveness vaccinations need. effectiveness drops 50% gonna stop itself.

But yeah there's already mutations going on, there's reason flu virus returns every year fully expect COVID stay.

I doubt well 50% vaccinations going reached without making mandatory. mean first ones get health care workers there's backlash workers wanting vaccin untested.

Once vaccine readily available everyone eager get either. keep distance, work home, direct contact one person I'm gonna wait see everything plays out. (I'm anti vax btw, I'm fully vaccinated everything recommended) Maybe he's waiting see vaccine turns us zombie not. hope people orgy dungeon parties temp checked first Wrong. Chinese scientists submitted data January think irrational want display confidence new vaccine process. 

He knows exactly information anyone else read study results. He's epidemiologist 300\~ test subjects total?

Isn't number *way* small kind confidence this, though?

Like, fully possible 8 people among pool happened exposed COVID? something rudimentary I'm understanding, I'm sure follow confidence all. It’s conspiracy. Lay partisan nonsense think goddamn second. USA remains country divided COVID-19 vaccine.

Probably idiotic headline I’ve ever read sub 🤣 US **not** divided comes vaccinated. think title would likely belong shithole France. Redditors say Americans become vaccinated? I'm sure gonna waiver signed everyone receiving vaccine. would cripple company even big Pfizer something went wrong. Also, want cover asses. chief executive officer Pfizer corporation, responsible mobilizing resources Pfizer corporation proper effective creation distribution one sole means seeing globe current crisis.... going one first vaccinated... **why??** essential worker job qualified vaccination target, please tell me. still 1/3 every drug passed fda turns previously unknown harmful effects

I hope you’re troll it’s sad think real person fucking clueless. he'd accused jumping line, he's immediate danger. wait towards end next week, decent number in-danger healthcare workers received vaccine, combine shot PR visit either lab (talk developers steps safety checks went through) factory (talk workers safe processing shipping is), feel-good montage workers saying much means help bring end pandemic, they're looking forward everyone getting get lives, Fauci gets shot. reason bullshit senses tingling. officials Long Island Jewish Medical Center asked staff volunteers among first take coronavirus vaccine, Sandra Lindsay raised lingering skepticism vaccine, even among staff, Ms. Lindsay, director critical care nursing, said wanted lead example — particularly Black woman understands legacy unequal racist medical treatment experimentation people goal today,” said phone interview Monday. “Not first one take vaccine, inspire people look like me, skeptical general taking 9:20 a.m. Monday, Ms. Lindsay, 52, became one famous nurses United States state officials said first person country vaccinated feels surreal,” said. “It huge sense relief me, hope.”

November 9: announced results Holy math... 21st feb 😭 Nutters won’t swayed one way another. Regardless whether takes not.

A lot folks “on fence” positively affected taking it.

If takes - downside “oh look! all-important rich folks get sooner us!”.

If doesn’t take - fuckin suspicious. mean cmon. It’s either PR stunt (and already took it, wants “good guy” pr) he’s fence himself. explanation doesn’t fuckin hold water. Healthcare workers laid off? That's poorly managed states CEOs power consequences actions.
But even then, that'd early stages pandemic everything shut down. Right now, total opposite. They're expanding running staff. (In Mr.krabbs voice) fools go first. Money! Money!Money! cut crap, take damn vaccine, show godamn world you’re afraid company’s creation. 

Conspiracy over...... it’s also bad look CEO said I’m going get one instead frontline worker.

Politicians opposite (trying get early) people mad confident vaccine works numbers age group able spread though?

They fucked up, got complacent well, they're at. thing happened many parts US. CA, example, got daily deaths 50s (40 million population!) restrictions. decided Thanksgiving 3 weeks later we're 200s again.

The REAL lesson: restrictions work get complacent decide ignore en masse, pay price. realized stock thing really bad PR he's try balance out. like even needs it. Someone position chill mansion virtual meetings lol. literally sacrifice making big deal PR move make look like man people profiteer. may severe allergy That's fair. legit medical issue, see problem getting wear it. Good point. 

At point flight reconsidered though, like caught guard. Ahhhh, right right. Got it. can't really compare two fairly. would interesting know many deaths there'd modern testing medicine. I'm guessing it'd comparable bad flu seasons. Seems many cities states can't lockdown they're missing taxes forced cut budgets. California expected $5 billion surplus year, back [June announced expect $54 billion one getting little tired word “science” mean anything want mean? “I trust people
Who dedicated lives delivering safe effective vaccines.” “science” slogan makes mean nothing buzzword. 

But props nurse. Every ten years repeat storyline. It’s almost time summer Punk again. definitely see factor, talking deaths. We've talking flu positivity.

So, sure: people would tested positive flu season dead, we're talking huge decrease positivity rate. Like 98% reduction one year now. Agreed. New York’s death rate per capita higher Florida’s, wonder. anyone actually looked see lockdowns WORK? Without bringing New Zealand Australia? Bc ship sailed March. 

At one point second order effects worse .06% fewer COVID cases gyms outdoor dining closing? math doesn’t add up. I've tried multiple times 71 year old diabetic mother. Every time talk it, seems convinced, short later sends horsecrap article vaccine going cause infertility mutate DNA whatever. 71, infertility least worries FFS. would valuable global community take vaccine. 

There lot people antivaxxers legitimately skeptical vaccine. better way show common folk vaccine safe trusted leading example. 

Not conspiracy theorist seeing CEO take seems like obvious logical widely beneficial decision would encourage others take vaccine. 

Trying ""cut line"" sounds like lip service. Username checks Shut up, Paul. Okay guy CEO company created it. That's little different random rich guy. think taken vaccine show confidence it. Half America says they'll refuse take it. looked entitled news. glad got banned. Social distancing masking caused influenza cases collapse. continue forever save millions lives. One vaccine dose isn’t going save lives, let’s realistic. 

The amount people hold vaccine CEO company made doesn’t want take yet? probably cause harm. Alright, get it.

Makes lot sense now.

I still think looks possible vaccine infections could thin gap if, like, tested 43,000 *further* test subjects, also assume general trend that's seen across favourable vaccines, reads even better. buddies SF might see way, commute involves biking scootering bus. torture like from-the-burb’s commute, still fun.

But take point - far better live away. 43k people trial total 8 infected vaccine 162 placebo basic science says children spread disease much much less adults. Stop lying. kids autism sensory issues. 

However, know kid one ones can’t deal, don’t fly. Flying optional activity. I’ll still blame parents refusing mask kid. Yes aware.

The likelihood incredibly miniscule. I'd rather risk long term respiratory side effects beta tester vaccine even CEO taken yet. 

Please make bold statements considering even know potential long term side effects vaccine are. (There unrelated medications still prescribed today cause blood clots, cancer, hallucinations, ect ...) 

Of course suppositions, time tell! defo first find experience though Perhaps disability thought mention preventing comprehending comments Devil. changed socks recently? Latin anyone whose heritage derives Latin culture. Latin Americans share many cultural traits Southwest Europeans (Portugal/Spain/Italy/Southern France) exact reason. widespread ignorance world history US many use term incorrectly, doesn’t mean different meaning. 

It quite telling thread, Latin communities mentioned example cultural patterns Italians, proving exactly point (obviously, culture emphasizes physical closeness strong family ties problematic COVID times) people really understanding comparison coming from. Fines based market cap public companies, net worth owners private companies. Fuck one size fits obviously needs low enough tiny businesses pay fuck / skirt rules, meanwhile means absolutely NOTHING Amazon. Make % market cap, watch Amazon comply immediately.

I hope families escape unscathed. commented remaining life, got angry topics “country” thought. mean Greek bet houses one country. think trying make point vaccination distributed fairly general. thoughts exactly. I’m pretty terrified quickly vaccine whipped due global pressure working vaccine. small island 70 cases (out million something people) I’m gonna conservative vaccine known Trust me, lot people anti-vaxxers like idea getting brand new vaccine. anti-vaxxerr issue.

This, people take another summer butt sitting. know better map? seems like data changes fast. Thank service. Congrats you! great time next year celebrating! Agree 100%. Someone's going upset either way, better remembered jerk cut line guy told everyone else take vaccine take himself. Yeah probably prostate bone lung 1 percent 350 million 3.5 million. Plus significant number long lasting effects. People dumb. odds scenario person misses vaccine one, catches COVID another chance get vaccine, (probably extra day two) dying astronomically small. would bet everything I’ve ever owned ever wouldn’t happen. 

The upside CEO taking vaccine convincing skeptics safety getting people vaccinated.

The downside 1 trillion scenario.  Thanks! think vacancy sign would probably get message across slow folks don’t understand term capacity means. Trusting rule rather exception science. Trusting tested hypotheses hold scrutiny science. Refusing trust things skepticism proven otherwise, qualifications prove doubt accurate, science.

There's chance meteor smacks home kills finish typing comment, trust won't. Science shown likelihood infinitesimal worry. since reading right now, suppose right so, I? Yes, pretended real eight months.

(Is post fffffkin p*litica1 pretend thrilled people getting medical limosine service killing us?) call “politician” fair probably busy counting money credible.

What private would want buy privatelay doses, matter price? somebody tried? Also free certain age recall correctly. None parents used opportunity yet. hell mean ? Kind wish said something insanely provocative like ""if dumb get vaccine deserve covid"" since going ruffle feathers regardless Science huge field like medicine they're expertise probably something entirely different vaccines somewhat related note, noticed Pfizer vaccine trials involved two mRNA variants, BNT162b1 BNT162b2. b2 version one approved distribution, heard anything efficacy b1 version? You’re getting downvoted mean haven’t said anything wrong Science (from Latin word scientia, meaning ""knowledge"") systematic enterprise builds organizes knowledge form testable explanations predictions universe.  
  
Science methodology, approach acquire knowledge, verify(and potentially disprove) hypothesis. there’s “scientific invention” so-called man-made science. Science method use learn natural world, apply learnt practice. Resident here, stoked get vaccine tomorrow. Feels like Christmas Eve :) Appropriate season, suppose People nursing homes already dying. 

That’s they’re nursing homes. Anyone find site tracking many vaccines administered far? saw NY estimated 10,000 yesterday alone. “They’re can”

Are really licking boots politicians haven’t passed stimulus corporate interests greed? rest modern world stepped citizens type system place support them, us. 

Americans send kids back school go back work. employer brazenly flaunts health standards gives fuck job dedicate life profit. That’s American way /s course true. vaccines normally take years establish safety. people keep antibodies many years.

We much certain data months, Covid young, far people post-covid kept antibody levels months that.

""However, study published journal Immunity Tuesday, found people recover even mild cases COVID-19 produce antibodies believed protect infection least 5 7 months, could last much recent research suggests years, decades keeping   tragedy enough evidence confidently say risk long-term side effects near minimum.

The reason pharmaceutical companies seek liability waiver long-term side effects vaccines - proof. let kid near pedo even claims he's son god. Wtf Lmao ok, note replied story haunted room 😆 probably that's one group never really gets tested drug trials - pregnant women - there's always uncertainty around potential birth defects/complications new drug.

The horror Thalidomide made lot people cautious comes birth defects. boggles mind lying immunization deadly disease willingly spreading would make liable manslaughter charge. is... hoping obvious enough wouldn’t need put /s tag guess fact people could said unironically tragedy itself. Russian Chinese intelligence services working past 15 years destabilize NATO countries. Truth=Fiction everyone questions everything. It’s Soviet propaganda tactic many years. way trust science, reject blind nationalism look common goals. internet propaganda pushed always characterized one dimensional hatred group. problem come self sustaining era Trump Boris.  Considering passed clinical trials fastest way return life back normal. I'm it. goes show society really poor coping skills enough help good enough mental health care providers. Thats important fund mental health programs. guys need quit acting like irrational nervous brand new vaccine. Implicitly trusting almost stupid antivax. hahaha. Hell yah United Airlines. Ya womp womp, even know person replying too. Womp womp guess right. Exactly! There's significant difference dying *now* dying former due completely preventable condition.

It's one thing take risk, another take needless risk, entirely different thing force risk upon unwilling. thing mRNA treatment know much long term effects, since relatively new technology. fundamentally different traditional vaccine.

The way gov approval works need balance potential risk new class vaccines risk everyone dying Covid/crumbling economy and/or social unrest; right wrong. Heck, remember, beginning pandemic Dr Fauci persistent mask denier. done good cause, bullshit nonetheless.

From macro perspective, would insane approve vaccine, given negligible short-term side effects unknown long-term effects. issue micro perspective, would prefer risk dying Covid vs risk long-term side effects mRNA treatment? would rather take jab traditional, low-risk Vaccine?

Mr CEO already given answer: undergo novel treatment immediate Covid risk? Obsessed weird word use.

They get easy convenient, either prevents getting flu makes far less bad still catch it. also lowers risk giving someone else might get worse you.

To save folks Googling: vaccination rate 65+ US 73% Pfizer boss given first. look sheeps taking kind goodwill thing Get hands busy find ways cope stuck house going on. busy wont thinking food. think hungry water ate. (Was complusive eater). People know doctors, nurses health professionals know know immune conspiracies. Hello, Covid antibody test IgG , got results 3.8 AU/ml supposed negative, 3.8 signify antibodies blood small? Damn hypocrite d-bags White House (as well every political douche) never followed restrictions same. Lol trust it. Wants see happens others first understanding intended local usage, export.

The main obstacle stage III trial set start around April, much Israeli population already vaccinated. undoubtedly need conduct stage III trial abroad. son registered nurse, thank service hope fare well global crisis. living fear (although sometimes hell cares?), living obligation help keep others alive. hostess pagers pretty brilliant. love creativity spawned this, too. 

And yeah, resulting photos could professional Christmas card. Almost makes wish kid could tow picture well. affects 1 100k definitely way less bad COVID-19 - even side effect death. Realize numbers don’t tell everything.

A couple docs work GOT covid recovered aren’t getting straight away they’d rather defer vaccine someone could better use it. trust science that's skeptical Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines. Medical society set bar high vaccines could confidently say vaccines safe years data scientific analysis. process developing vaccine extremely thorough. usually takes 4+ years properly develop vaccine. especially need data long-term side effects. 

Are confident say Covid-19 vaccines standards vaccines? can't. Would love know compensation payout requirements payout don’t know long anybody gets vaccine live.    
She could outlive you. masks social distancing since early June.

Borders open compassionate leave granted key workers. 14 day isolation return, Inc members house. freely leave must granted permission return.

Anyone adhering law gets 2-4 week stay ""Jurby Hilton"" (prison) government's expense + criminal record trouble.

[Man jailed Scotland Isle Man jet ski weeks jail welders broke isolation driver jailed breaking isolation seems strict we're small place (85k close communities) one hospital large scale outbreak would destroy us hence rules, everyone knows rules. Facebook warriors saying everyone laughing us jailing people nipping shop sandwich rather going residence world seen since Feb, takes one law quite clear.

I'm thankful government backbone mrs coming home tears everyday March May (she's nurse). friends nurses, same. 9-16 hr shifts full ppe on. Really feel everyone everywhere else, really good people still bs all, infuriates much I've started standing keyboard warriors I've never done before. Unless sarcasm, doubly fantasy non-thinking paranoid crap. instance definitively, objectively, said absolutely not. upvotes comment downvotes tells maybe view possibly common think I'd like start looking vaccinations effect overall infection rates. anyone know emerging vaccination dataset UK? - anywhere else world?   Let HaTrEd flow 🤣🤣 vaccine safe. know this. 

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  100% agree. individuals last line given every opportunity beforehand experience COVID19 first hand. personally know two ICU nurses NY, confidently believe virus created lab. bought speak vaccine part population control conspiracy. TIL people like make fun conspiracy theorists stop post title conspire truth behind it. Marvelous! load crap unworthy even response. Sanctions laws *regering* *riksdag* define, new law actually sanction listed: fines. FHM administrative agency. work within existing legal framework. expect force anything, don’t mandate. general population deserve it? reason believe vaccine wouldn’t cause complications?

It’s fear unknown without proof either side table it’s rational fear. People want tear others apart it’s vaccine COVID. situation considered logical thinking.

Say got vaccine cause us kids, sacrifice we’re supposed okay making? Rather continuing practice safety standards since beginning? proves lockdowns pointless keep coming them. People losing livelihoods temporary relief  Hello, nurse. ghosts here. One time bunk due snow, volunteered sleep ""haunted"" patient room everyone like oooooohhh nooooo. slept great.  never thought would see words ""trust"" ""belief"" associated ""science"". foundations scientific method skepticism, experimentation, hypothesis testing, reasoning things - trust belief.

i guess nurse means trusts scientific authority establishment. unfortunately, conflation scientific authority science common also dangerous. enough staff. know hospital situation, right? 44,000 That’s really clever sounds like makes lovely photo!

I saw friend’s photos kids Santa year. outdoors think Christmas tree farm. Santa inside big inflatable snow globe kids posed globe. photos came really cute feel like nice nod weird social distancing year without looking depressing.

I asked lines said borrowed hostess pagers local restaurant that’s indoor dining. signed photos wandered around outdoors waited family called. 

There’s much awful stuff pandemic I’ve really inspired ingenuity people Using logic, world also needs something US Given believe official count infections several times lower actual amount, 20 percent US already tested positive.

Plus fact cross-immunity coronaviruses yet-unexplained innate resistance virus.

Then might need many jabs reach 70 percent experts predict result herd takes it, pro-vaccine folks upset cut line, anti-vax folks think got saline injection. There's winning play, least way doctor nurse somewhere stop worrying much hurting killing family members. I'm nurse master's consider pretty intelligent, could never hack pharmacy school. majority thought earth 6000 years old back then. line go, less PR cutting line.

I personally would say stop CEO gray area century crisis. There's exactly precedent build public trust avoid destructive selfishness, perhaps appearance enough common sense. sad reality majority us waiting months choice offered today would take work lot ignorant people. co-worker tonight, like person say going live fear pointed mask, everyone supposed wearing.

I told live fear mask precaution. wear seatbelt fire extinguisher home. shruged shoulders nothing say.

I'm hoping offered us sooner though essential time tell. extort federal government money. Simple that. source back chance? something making believe vaccine risk causing infertility? well fun part science doesn’t need trust. based proof. Agreed. It’s also poisoned waters, children, society whole. DuPont &amp; Ely Lily come mind... Damn, actually wanted hop Grenada Christmas. Hope tracing works.

What surprise happens 1000+$ night resort. may side effects long term? evidence would effect fertility? occurred vaccine before? Random guy street, “life beautiful” buck stops somewhere yonder? Same-o. Fucking Pfizer taking credit tell, they're mass-manufacturer/distributor. 

An important role, actual developers (BioNTech) investors (EU, Germany, Fosun) get least credit, imo. reason believe vaccine would prevent kids? so? Ahh classic im anti vaxxer line. Never get tired seeing around Nailed 100% agreed. Reddit hates Richie people much they’re broke That's sad. 

Let's hope one car accident heart issue... wonder anything Bolsonaro's comments? Yeah got “let’s see plays first take it” vibe  persuasive Dr Fauci said take it. Pfizer release data stages, released met pre-established number infections, actually proper way it. (Until number reached, neither volunteers researchers knew many infections group. prevent data manipulation.) Russian team got criticism releasing data early, scientifically solid (their fist release happened day Pfizer release, looks like political reasons, trying keep up.) History repeat, rhyme.  sad reality PA, NJ, NY governors made humongous mistake beginning pandemic one saying word it. believe earlier year (around July/August) 43,000 deaths (at time 80,000 total) nursing homes per NYTimes Absolutely points. r/ithinkyoushouldleave would anyone want prolong make worse?
I know nothing happened America lot world put form lockdown, comment seem paranoid presume anti-vaxx? original post all. Perspective mean, It’s 1 vaccine 💉💀  That’s fuel fire conspiracy people. South dakota almost 40% testing positivity, ND 10 numbers might close legit didn’t know sub existed. I’m confused people could get lost Reddit forget sun in.  There's also mental health consequences everyone around them. going expensive many ways. got company email outlining events spreading covid, none listed parties. can't forward email I'll get fired.  vaccines 6 year old issues test. ""It uncomfortable, it. see ice cream place there? We're drive right test"" - goes smooth. all, lot less unpleasant blood test. drive symptoms, test done comply travel orders pretty sure everyone healthy. THIS! FFS know components, extensive external testing things. sneak stuff injectables, least US. did, really says something outbreak here. prolly get regeneron catches whether getting vaccine take away someone else? Oh no, could predicted tragedy, won’t kind soul extend helping hand? could seen coming, oh nooooos “In interview, CBS’s Margaret Brennan said CVS said workers would give nursing home vaccinations Dec. 21, “because Trump administration told wait date. Trump administration asking nursing homes wait?”

“We're actually asking nursing homes wait,” Azar replied. “And able really good discussion CVS leadership misunderstanding president's vaccine distribution summit. think we've gotten straightened them. we'll getting CVS Walgreens vaccinating nursing home people. hundred -- almost 100% nursing homes signed program turnkey vaccination operation.”

Azar said nursing home vaccinations could start “any day,” nursing home residents could vaccinated Christmas.

But two sources confirmed delay.

Sounds like classic said said supporting evidence either way everyone's thoughts Cansino vaccine? 

Usually Sinovac Chinese vaccine gets attention, never heard one. doesn’t mean isn’t relevant either.

We’re middle pandemic still. Many places aren’t even keeping testing needs doctors overworked.

They’re focusing distinction infection reinfection right now.

The fact cases found means it’s happening. even bother first shot you’re going get second? treatment 2 shots two weeks immunity (hypothetically), it. also allow relaxing removing protocols individuals, imo. yet read article society trust government makes big difference. US public trust government, value privacy personal freedom good society ”I personally known ‘Santa’ ‘Mrs. Claus’ entire life assure everyone would never knowingly done anything place children danger,”

Guess guys, vaccine isn’t safe, serious negative repercussions would never survive CEO. either believe it’s safe, willing tank company bet...

I trust CEO protect bottom line something silly like health. Riiiiiiiiiiiiight wealthy rich people dont take vaxx. eat healthy. 
lot upper class californians done take vaxx either. point though. hard justify govt mandated shutdown risk hospitals gone. feel like it’s safer wait go ahead honestly don’t see optics bad?

Read here: Funny one talks dr Fauci's extensive study peer reviewed paper masks killed people flu did, bacterial infections bacterial pneumonia. You’re probably right happened. 
Why fucking hard wear mask. people act like 2 year olds. Literally. It’s aggravating. forget even mine time. YES PLEASE. YESSSS PLEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAASEEEEEE!!!! That's thoughtful him. need this. Imma call bullshit one I've gotten traction. truly difficult thing. original proposal Operation Warp Speed develop several vaccines, work, one two work would enough.  plan work, *the government would need purchase enough doses vaccine cover entire population.*  Basically 400 million units product, cover US.

The plan was, several vaccines worked, extra doses could given poor countries, even wasted.  wastage planned expected, sure enough.

But, buy doses.  So, seems, enough doses go around, unless vaccines work. plane wearing mask underneath nose throughout video wearing gaiter 1:20 mark. Way give anti vax crowd ammo Lmao said thing. diplomatic way saying 100% trust side effects wonky. asked weeks ago would fine taking first alotment state. I'm sure safe rather wait month two see there's weird side effects pop millions starting take PR created message

people would say got live TV Again, dumbass point? let free see grandma ? know city LA County (Manhattan Beach, CA) loophole county’s ban outdoor dining city making outdoor dining, wondering work impact number cases city. know Pasadena still outdoor dining.    100%. first impression hearing surprise. already assumed Pfizer team would taken vaccine rolling public. vaccine going administered hundreds millions - billions - people, Pfizer team actually important frontline worker, period. Imagine key people Pfizer team becoming incapacitated virus...any delay production/decision making affect millions people negatively line. Imagine CEO actually getting virus negative affect would transitioning new CEO in. make sense 59 year old (old enough at-risk group death Covid) would take vaccine. reason gives comes across nonsensical platitude worries reassures me. I'm ""anti-vaxxer"", makes sense all. He's arguably important person vaccination project, along team. hero deserve   data trials? human beings. such, judge person, race. always stand fellow humans longer. Lol - can’t win matter does. get vaccine, people criticize using privilege cut line. doesn’t, people criticize standing safety company’s products. idiots saying thing parts America super high death rates. South Dakota example  Herd immunity vaccine always considered eventual strategy He’s CEO company valued $16B.

The median pay pharma CEO upwards $5M annually. paid develop, market, sell drugs.

And you’re impression he’s busy golf club luncheons bother? conspiracy till people start licking elbows. Fauci's crystal ball far incredibly poor. he’s waiting work kinks loll

He’s danger several million guinea pigs go 

Sorry know I’m cuntrarian Maybe there’s reason time see it, word used incorrectly, trendy way thinking right now. Something happens, get afraid conspiracy theorists might see something. conspiracy theory theory others may conspiring, definition making secret plans jointly commit unlawful harmful act. designing releasing vaccine profit/ status definitely fits. Maybe news England regarding deaths vaccine bit worried.  makes ally. I'm canadian indigenous. appreciate still. 1/3 COVID deaths nursing homes 5 states, coincidentally, states Governors sent COVID patients nursing homes.

Cuomo Murphy highest death rate world New York New Jersey thanks policy sending COVID patients nursing homes.

They screamed Trump would never get USNS Comfort NY Harbor time, did. Cuomo use sent away. Trump built $21million Covid Facility Red Hook, Brooklyn. Cuomo closed without seeing single patient. Cuomo closed Javits Center Billy Jean King ($58mm) Covid triage center built Trump.

They murdered people get rid Trump... but, hey, worked.

The 5 Nursing Home Killers sent COVID patients nursing homes responsible nearly 100,000 deaths respective states.

* Cuomo NY: 35,200 dead
* Murphy NJ: 17,750 dead
* Wolf NJ: 12,600 dead
* Whitmer MI: 11,200 dead
* Newsom CA: 21,000 dead

Just 5 states alone killed nearly 100,000 people.

If remove numbers 5 Democrats generated US totals, would see overall US response quite remarkable compared countries.

Cuomo ringleader knew doing.

Highlighting fact fact Pennsylania, Health Secretary, Rahcel Levine - trans-man, removed mother nursing home sent COVID patients.

They knew doing. knew going happen. Antigens vaccine, RNA codes proteins cells tricked producing (in case, coronavirus spike protein). cells become little factories spike protein, theory mRNA could code anything (good bad) hence speed market... Ok. there’s correlation: gets cold people go inside. There’s causation says doesn’t spread certain weather types like you’re suggesting. Yeah! Let mix cocain alcohol weed holiday season! Wooo!



Noo dont give medication take life builds immunity specific virus. kill even tho 0 evidence ): r/coronavirus: baddies? I’m Anti-Vaxx definitely raised eyebrow .. obviously? Yes! tf attitude unpopular right now. feels completely reasonable. Same. want travel again. love flying much! year That's communists. aremt even allowed machine guns starbucks. No, doesn’t trust product feel bad good people state federal government shit pants them. mRNA vax passed trials humans?

I’m surprised didn’t get upvoted sub Plot twist...to determined later date indefinite ban much worse loved one dying alone ventilator hospital. poor people /s someone whose father assisted living facility, thank hard work. means realize. side country &amp; killing able him, grateful workers best. Really glad see mods removed comment pathetic upvoted comment thread. Says lot sub. Right, theres ‘definitely’ going take group, ‘maybe’ ‘never’. cant worry nevers create big circus show ‘convince’ people risk scaring away maybe group mandatory mean without condition. guess kids naughty list

(just trying funny... hold kids accountable idiotic parents) Wisconsin mask mandate since July. good CEO would take give confidence people. 

If aircraft mechanic won’t fly plane working on, would want fly it. 30,000 people study. Given random chance still confidence interval. look enough conditions one look little strange.

And hell, even way confidence interval, rate I'd take it. Yeah appear stats. Oh poor Johnny car crash died. happens. tell poor Johnny would alive go five er finding ICU bed still free cause Covid people taking resources available. working government privilege? know lot people anti vaxx, oppose COVID vaccine feel rushed. get yearly flu shot. think lot people pro vaccines may wait take it. One top comments someone literally mad he'd take vaccine &amp; thousand upvotes.

So, no, flat 100% unquestionably wrong every sense word. fact even think things concerning anything brought up. Wow ""Scientism religion"" 

Common sense? conspiracy actually listen science educated people say anything concerning vaccine. Personally think shouldn’t reward people choose spread it. I’ve bunkered mentally suffered whole time don’t get rewarded?

Give risk essential make longer priority. guy needs airplane mask drop mentality. really important needs take damned vaccine. Since mods like comment, here's politically correct rephrase:

40,000 people studies indicative real life vaccination outcome test subjects trials ones found actual societies. Long trials establish safety among people diseases various risk profiles.

That said, whole discussions entirely beyond actual point original response. responding point :

""Do actually think randomly causes total organ failure something? Real life isn’t Plague Incorporated dude""

By providing case exact thing happened, get obviously irrelevant response vaccine type.

Red herring galore. Yeah. I’ll take does. wondering day. super handy. Y'all need peep /r/COVID19 check post. Please educate spread word. Roughly one year pandemic novel virus, scientists able isolate virus, sequence genome, create test safe effective vaccine using fairly new technology (mRNA).

I too, trust science. Literally hundreds thousands lives saved; huge chunk economic damage prevented scientists. fact, anybody awe regarding achievement ignorant entitled piece shit. Remember obama got flu helicopter flew hospital experimental drugs? Wow seals deal flying kids next years. think get 2 year old wear mask nuts. stop flights together. [I miss crying I’m pretty sure China’s lockdown pretty militaristic. can’t prove would almost say you’d jailed shot violating quarantine.

Locking doesn’t mean anything consequences violating it. state locked down. yeah, businesses closed meant couldn’t really go places much. guess happened violated every single mandate? damn thing. Gee, wonder numbers up...... Let's honest he's ceo, mean knows everything it. information knows comes scientists made it. could secret documents passed onto him, saying knows medicine cuz he's boss like saying I'm surgeon, GPA says otherwise. 

Either way gonna get shat on.
1. takes it, gets accused jumping line cuz he's rich.
2. take it, gets accused knowing vaccine work... Yep. much money stake. Yup, lot fear mongering reality it’s normal capacity No, thank you. never stops blowing mind people constantly screech loving America carry guns heros save lives irredemably full shit. even accept minor inconveniences save lives neighbors, selfish chuds. Damned do, damned don’t 🤷🏼‍♂️ came see thought already written Yea traveling NYC (or anywhere) right isn’t ideal. Someone tell vaccine... take virus takes Everyone else either already take marketing department like census year

Edit: add that, limited doses, itll need worry point knows, CEO may take then. never used think lowly America, everything I've heard country lately completely dumb. lost cause. Source this? believe true, I've never seen evidence. leader told pussies sheep wear masks are. So, entire nursing home naughty list? Or...he doesn’t want guinea pig? Thank you. believe celebrities scientists? contrary person. talking OG Santa Secretly Abstract

It’s state governors jobs adjust. don’t bailout money? don’t put people second shutdown fuck state decades decades Oh? “I don’t want become zombie”-this guy probably Great point. want wait arent going get anyway, cater make big show Red = Dead Yes, allergic reactions things severe need epi pen sits throne lies ""mandate"", enforcement punishment. 

That's strong suggestion. get that, first question's context also related I'm asking about. Probably month, vaccines new restrictions expect curve flatten bit. MN back 10% positivity rate. Gives hope. really expect person believe vaccines believe that? People think moon landing staged, people believe that's injecting saline solution front camera instead vaccine microchip going chilling effect. aunt Facebook going post, “Pfizer’s CEO won’t take vaccine. telling us?” Bunch know-it-all self righteous people Reddit, that’s why... every state/city different. think city child 6 years old exempt. didn’t liar sounds like full blown lose/lose. evidence privileges going restricted? morons “wait see” whatever, means I’ll get sooner one larger studies. I'm totally board normalizing people wearing masks they're sick public. Go work cold flu sick days duties perform? Wear mask. Coughing commuter bus train, wear mask. Picking soup, decongestants tissues drug store, wear mask. reasonable would lessen spread flu contagions future. Generally public opinion polling count people say would wait yes. almost 70% country indicating confident vaccine poll taken. Would disagree black Americans' skepticism US government well founded? Oh sure Mr. random Redditor, Pfizer completely ethical company would never rush product money, trust they’re client yours!!! know might tangential actual virus saw article thought maybe would help people.

Sorry doesn’t belong here. gonna happen. Who’s gonna keep accountable? 😂 going track water? None people would believe really took vaccine. can't beat stupid. talked doctor it; said women certain age (35+) it’s better try soon possible covid didn’t pose great risk mother fetus. It’s also possible home birthing center birth plan you’re good health. Lmao Don’t go dragging mother this, woman saint. Ever heard word “especially”? 

He works. He’s worker hesitations too. think taking vaccine publicly makes circus feeds anti-vaxxers theories. “Why need show us safe safe?” arent anti hesitant, theres millions doses need go made quickly possible. worry ‘definitely’ worry ‘maybe’ ‘never’ groups. 

Just opinion, equally valid Ehh that’s debatable. 2 year old special needs autistic? really expect able keep mask dont want to? They’re fucking toddlers adults... many politicians 200 million? also know fact whether vaccine even prevents reduces transmission yet. Vaccination right focusing protecting people vaccinate. Nurses right make decision vaccinate later, want

Once data indicating A) vaccine effective reducing transmission B) safe long term, change thinking messaging [archive link anyone trouble accessing article concerning someone saying ""20 days matter"" getting many upvotes. kind support group? got positive test evening. I'm going continue wearing mask indefinitely. would prefer cold scrambling mask go out.

Once COVID endemic longer pandemic - mask gets thrown bonfire. bribe people get it? Covid lotto, payments vaccinations, etc... everyday Fauci flip flops drastically, many blindly worshipping man admit it.  knows it’s info people talking wearing masks people stopped, thought ‘protected others’ wearer....or another lie?! 12 months better 6 would say April -june would reasonable window give everyone access vaccine. However, lot people take it, normal probably much later. take vaccine still spread patients. moment it’s said help prevent person vaccinated suffering serious illness nothing saying vaccinated person can’t still transmit disease someone else. I’m saying vaccine person transmit it, still get Covid receiving vaccine since symptoms less severe apparent, still spread unknowingly. Plus weeks 2nd dose tested efficacy Wow, great job powering that. Glad arms, always brings replies Reddit. son, we've talked this.  would. True. many, serious conservative critics summer's unrest becoming worried Trump loss/rigging conspiracy going animate violent corollary right, since saw election victory light end tunnel. We'll also studying dishonest dangerous language used political leaders turned long time, think. see patients would need rooms sitting like busy ER, it'd great. 


FWIW urgent care frequent requirement years-they hand mask walk wear till room. Never seen anyone challenge it. may good doctor give four, sure. agree! Yes, set suburbs Boreal forest, arctic circle 

:)

Where people actually live look at, especially land habitable.

There Canadian shield arctic circle stopping development dakotas, empty.

The good land Canada loads people it, come visit! None bring important moment. Plenty others agendas do. think too. Sporadic outbreaks, rare fatal outbreaks care homes  100% value much entire population. I’m saying x group take risk people want let smart cautious. many people suffered injuries death name science ? Many. don’t want dictate anyone else myself, think I’m dictating take ? quick assume know say assuming. We've Moderna vaccine people since March. know LOT now. 👍👊 result international backlash would harm good.

So glad Trump office Well said! mean, bad frequent colds flus everyone keeps going about...maybe people boost immune system?! I’m 42 flu can’t remember last time cold... I'm vaccinated, fuck peace mind. mask off. Balloux like Bollocks. stance BS ultimately proven wrong presents hypothetical happen. LOT go pandemic next summer absent vaccine. start grad school @ BU end January, kind nervous - mind remote learning really lasts spring, y'all really toeing line puns Please don’t give agenda thing. Don’t think immunologists epidemiologists acknowledge role immunity?!? Yeah, quit restaurant job reason. owner doesn’t care employees. Two coworkers got Covid-19, didn’t tell anyone got exposed get tested quarantined. Luckily quit immediately. week later, coworkers got COVID symptoms. restaurant shut finally. Drove secluded st park - count? Thats literally nothing lmao Florida reported highest single day new cases day Thanksgiving. state also 123,000 out-of-state travelers Thanksgiving, data sample shows -- state, likely representing 1 million scaled full population.

Okay. Part disingenuous. Specifically, this: reported highest single day new cases day Thanksgiving.

Florida record cases Thanksgiving reported cases Thanksgiving cases following day. imagine worried announcement decade later causes cancer something else.

I would guess stems lack understanding long parts vaccine really last inside human body. Jesus no. It’s fact people simply going sacrifice two years lives. us selfless almost year I’m willing another couple months I’ve sacrificed job, savings, sanity. reasonably sacrifice much. think 90% people feel way. socially summer, don’t blame people wanting lives back. “small” sacrifice “inconvenience”. life ruining. seems arbitrary point. makes think it’s safer wearing one bar? Yes...take care family. circumstances like family dementia severe health problems require it. getting stuck homes they’re old family doesn’t time them. That’s dirty. wonky immune system always internalize vaccination immunities, also men stopped asking smile great. wouldn’t donate convalescent piss heads fire. guess OP get wish since he'll look like weirdo wearing mask office spread completely stopped. sounds like Facebook level conspiracy Good you. broke legs 2 months senior prom car crash. Fought way ICU 2 months rehab able walk crutches go prom - sure relates beyond prom, Keep mind nobody gets sick keep distancing, medical industry crisis.

Money stop flowing in.

Hospitals laying people left right year masks distancing meant getting patients.

No patients means money means layoffs galore!

I would prefer getting sick twice year mask public forever.

If personal choice, fine me.

But mandate? **Hell no!** mean focus office pfizer sure that's like small slice overall picture. Good Germany throwing money ring. call blood bank get convalescent plasma tell completely don’t know again.

Is thing us relatively safe (WFH, kids, strong isolation others) donating right now? way help? Honestly due respect Dr.Fauci, it’s language like harm good. Someone reading say “see take vaccine going ya wear masks indefinitely, winter comes going move 2022, 2023, etc”.

There needs clear timeline, understand that’s easier said done. really seem correlation still flying old flags concerned might kill someone

Huh. Weird. Damn Lmao fuck that, soon virus contaminated I'm throwing bitches out. No, defined wearing mask specifically “when you’re sick future, even “just sniffles” Note self. Log every human interaction.... making fun common trope porn two actors supposed step siblings. scene, one step siblings want engage intercourse, either stuck reason physically resist. Instead usually say something like, ""What doing, step bro?""

It pretty ridiculous premise, reddit community likes make fun it, applying situations something might stuck inside someone else, like needle vaccine. Well back fuck employees.

Wait, guys able leave first place? don’t understand we’re allowed dislike wear masks. It’s like desire get rid Covid+masks indicative kind moral failing people Americans even sick leave. last job current one 3+ weeks per year accrued people bragging hundreds hours banked who'd still come sick. Lack paid sick leave problem, culture ""work unless literally dying"" needs addressed to. enough spread either relevant. bring generally another agenda  Best bub works Hopkins he’s telling set hopes closer time next year. fingers crossed manufacturing goes quicker anticipated vaccination rate good could semi normal portion summer! Seems like good idea, I'm worried antivaxxers troll purpose. tell come US business booming! might come liability insurance issue. Doctor/nurse wearing mask? Liability Insurance wont cover lawsuit. husband stage 4 cancer, history pulmonary embolism, 60, along signs probable severe COVID infection catch it. like him. would wear mask permanently full-time got another minute him. Masks mandatory everywhere. I'll happily cede bragging rights global pissing contest rejoicing hundreds thousands saved lives. Take W.  Director security doesn’t good enough health coverage... salary benefits? O.o

Is wants people pay... really afford it? dont think would actively enforced time. figure we'll adopt general culture ""if feeling sick, wear mask public areas"", similar see HK Korean cities. courtesy opt in. Define killing people.you seriously want permanent masks? I'm office worker hope keep flu-season masks. least wearing one close contact coworkers. Sucks every year whole office gets sick week. want science fit neatly political ideology fit neatly political ideology, I'd argue opposite ""trusting science"". sub downplayed/shat drastic decline covid death rate instead celebrating it. money pay rest pocket get whenever want. God suck ac rancid conspiracy theorist.  sick, might well work (half joking). I'm still confused. answer question seem be? Wish best well! people telling Fauci say? He’s Director National Institute Allergy Infectious Disease - tells others say. Famous last words. 5 weeks, turned 6 months

Now basically shows people shouldnt allow even 5 weeks all. easy make longer longer. genie bottle going back then... choice. gave power letting go. matter logistics. IDGAF feel. recovery time patient takes longer one die actually addressing spread disease, reduce mortality point rise rest us catch it.

I feel risk category cut deaths reduce hospital crowding. Vaccinate super spreader demographic see case rates plummet.

I can't fit 3 people 2 beds. ethically, medically advisable. fewer beds available vaccine strategy vaccinate risk remove restrictions, made problem WORSE. keep dreaming cartoon head colonel sanders laughing I’m melting. always wake vomiting dream. Actually Canada South Dakota nearly population density around 11 people per square km. Canada basically North North Dakota. good you. one do. There’s way say normal 6 months now. Maybe you’ll outlier, maybe will. knows? What? told believe Sweden among worst world. agreeing. 60 Countries 300 deaths/100k (reported) reality definitely many more. numbers seen bad even back spring, 60 imo lot countries. major way failed contain fight virus. disagree, that's fine me.

And earth find inaccurate list. Sweden 25th confirmed deaths/100k, 29th confirmed cases/100k.

There tons countries worse several countries listed.

And even trying say? third world can't drive car? sub something else No, read right republican channels Telegram shits giggles, thing. Arrest Tiktok nurses, - everyone dances protective costumes, group dances masks

They enemy #1 short while, mindboggling  son says resting murder face, combine broad shoulders shy 6ft, masks make look like assassin. dig it. ignore science reality long, eventually catches you. That’s pretty much exact side effects seasonal flu shot. Honestly would expect baseline virus vaccine seems like good news. cements me. vaccine Exactly. There’s finally light end tunnel. hunker another 6-9 months easy peasy know vaccines here. mean USA vaccinate double people first 100 days? lot vaccines Moderna. bigot trust McScience

These buzzwords, man. people talk ""Science"" like one big entity, (scientific) PROCESS? guess antivax making rushed decision.

Also, apparently ""new technique"" something scary fuck; never mind took less year make vaccine. people talk ""oh used new never tried technique"" like something fucking terrifying risky.

Also [archive link anyone trouble accessing article arm still bit sore last weekend's tetanus shot. mean worth it, especially since work around sharp metal things lot. Christ fucking cross joyless fucking cesspit sub is. Can't agree vaccine good thing? celebrating harmless fun way bring negativity ? pandemic fucking ruined us, already were. Yeah agree. Masks fine, hard see friends long. eh long turn blind eye youll never know supidity like people her. really dont understand people vaccines. get wanting first group. Waiting 2 - 3 months. REALLY dont get outright no.  


It doesnt make sense Yup, give away tons cancer meds programs even cover liquid nutrition unhealthy eat normally. conservatives cool markets? expect private employers require it. ""big guvment"" intervention necessary. First mRNA vaccine virus. using mRNA vaccines cancer now. bit different tailored made individual. entirely new.  Get 5 violence met violence think win? Certainly society. 85% vaccinations unrealistic expectation. Less half Americans got regular influenza shot last year. CDC’s goal flu shots 70%.

With anti-vaccine rhetoric won’t even get close rate. People already bogus ""medical exemption"" cards mask wearing. I'm sure people already printing ""vaccine"" cards. New York Times reporting morning early data suggests Moderna’s vaccine least reduce transmission. Hopefully holds true data comes Good, need people advocating perennial distancing masks female wearing mask makes using Lipstick pretty damn trivial..... lol “ heard friend” wants act like they’re relaying first hand information. said upthread: make sure masks stay protect many illnesses. hard.

Now ""no one forcing you"". it? Literally what? got it. like odds taking vaccine risking Bells Palsy way taking playing 'spin symptoms wheel' covid.  really rushed don’t think anyone crazy taking vaccine. don’t like idea forcing people take (if comes that) know lot it, data published publicly online already. April june 2022? Yeah. dont see/imagine enough vaccination happening prior.. seems like supply distribution major logistical undertaking Yeah might lose head. takes year vaccinate everybody?

How going work? mental health children depends going see Santa. plenty families Christmas Santa, parents explain Santa visiting person easily enough. Zoom meeting, kids year long understand plenty well.

There's complete lack mental flexibility creative problem solving.

You know would really depriving kids childhood? serious illness. close family member die time. something preventable.

I 2 4 year old. yeah, parenting year worst. actually *they* care deviating traditions explain health safety issue. us adults care passing traditions, expense potentially exposing children close family members dying. herd immunity.

But cases drop restrictions. Masks public probably last thing go. Aw, poor baby. I'm frontline health worker. I'm getting vaccine. 

I trust vaccines. vaccinated required health risks prior COVID. think COVID vaccine cause people die short term. 

My issue long term effects. I'm healthy, young adult. Realistically, get covid, I'd likely little long term complications it. long term effects vaccine completely unknown. seen previous new drugs ""safe"", leading health complications worse drug initially given for. vaccine could lead aggressive cancer 5-10 years time, knows. 

I believe covid dangerous best SAFELY prevent spread. 

I hope choose vaccinate met best outcomes. I, unfortunately, trust vaccine get it. 

This view vaccine, argument it. I'm sure people find way feel repressed. They're good it. we’d switch forcing it. minimum convince employers force it. 


Once companies realize cheaper force employees get vaccinated firing ones don’t providing Covid related PTO, PPE, Testing, etc good luck anti vaxxers. propose get enforced? City's hard time enforcing something like parking ticket think enforce mandatory vaccination? giving soon huge horizon. suddenly hear effective, suddenly everyone taking kind long term side effects worried about? Anyone know aren’t using DPA scale manufacturing vaccines? Lol know operation warp speed is. wrong thing do, 170 countries thing. bare minimum POTUS would do. even done Trump anyway - money came Congress. countries actually worked together get vaccine approved. Trump refused work countries, slowing development. also tried use office way buy vaccine could one profiting it. 

You guys give Trump credit anything. denied science throughout entire pandemic throughout presidency. Could saved hundreds thousands lives taking seriously beginning instead chose lie American people encourage people wear masks social distance secretly telling friends short stock market COVID serious threat. 

Trump hindrance progress, cause it. He's main reason America worst COVID outbreak nation. Pro-vaccine propaganda fine book. 

Glad they're using psyop capabilities good time. lol... good Lord... heard one. Independent (a source poor reliability) good source sub? part one.. continued  still wear masks socially distance taking vaccine? so, long? Another vaccine?! Yep, think people miss speaks lens downgrading pandemic status.

I think point, officially downgrade pandemic status, semblances normalcy manifest (more liberal dining, wedding gatherings, economies begin recovering). actual pandemic won’t definition summer, would irresponsible provide guidance otherwise. article restarting phase 3 combined vaccine Russian company. reason change fair logical approach try appease morons Yeah wearing mask come March. Qatar study interesting, thank sharing. looks like good sample size. would love see study replicated. told conspiracy loving uncle back august trying tell it’ll election 🙄. like politics aside, work hospital told probably wearing masks forever. couldn’t even comprehend possibility probably still thinks Trump gonna pull win deep state. Low effort sealioning. Go back r/conspiracy.  used one procedure trials manufacturing used extreme cold temperatures, abundance caution.

Nothing else approved nothing else tested.

It well *could* fine room temperature (albeit unlikely), tested nobody knows can't said. Darn. can’t woodland critter Christmas sourced stop calling misinformation. Google ingredients infer crunch numbers familiar statistics that’s draw comfort? oh okay. Im afraid antimasker types gonna lie vaccine Costco now. hope that's meant well. said event cancellations, make sense (prolly want annual free love convention cases spiking regardless vaccination lol), say distancing, makes hopeful. whatever case, friends vaccinated i'm going made feel guilty want privately see go outdoor bar. redditors say whatever want, i'm jabbed whatever's legal legal. add post:
1) GBS rare
2) 2/3 GBS patients respiratory illness diarrhea onset GBS, rarely vaccination 
3) Almost GBS patients fully recover

I hope educated people would use fear GBS keep getting vaccination. I’m sure do.

 [GBS Yeah that’s brought aforementioned groups bc vaccinate people antivax come way return normal today husband skewed meaning chanukah told american people nice one another fight jequal rights. 

Um chanukah celebrates jews gaining freedom opresssed killed isnt jolyfull holiday. ya covid related another example irresponsbile comment IMO. public right front line workers.

There always going people taking it, it’s called antivaxx.

Now said wait verification. verified safe, take it. That’s all.

It seems desperate one you. keep claiming words something, can’t actually verify that.

This fun, don’t things cry about? 

I can’t wait see goal posts moved name intellectual honesty. Go say ""20 days matter"" relatives thousands Europeans dying every day Covid-19. figured. ;) exactly think youll find long term side effects waiting 6 months? Doubt true family members getting housekeeping. Could tell rushing slow? mean Russia approved vacine time ago, would trust one much. expecting year planning travel. Sucks families come visit though.  Let’s fucking go woot!
Here’s hoping username going irrelevant soon. SARS virus, even similar influenza virus way symptoms. read 90 Days/ 3 month. dozens us! also think collared shirts idiotic must tools oppression. quick spit test? \*draws chalk line 14ft away you\* please spit line. can't can't ride train, sir.  Can't remove comments know exist -- get reported, go mod queue review! sure get 50% agree color sky, seeing US every getting 85% vaccination covid vaccine 2020 way better 2019 me.

I’m bragging. would spend night box full murder hornets I’d ever want experience anything like 2019 again. selfish lizard brain like, ""cool, means get line sooner people stepping aside"" I’m saying get vaccinated Even so, non-contact thermal thermometer best thing since sliced bread since early march, ""safe enough"". nobody forced shutdown without adequate financial assistance.

and virtually point pandemic government support, financial otherwise, adequate. I’m glad Fauci setting expectations said would gone April said he'd win election landslide? hit 21 mil recovered (or died) mid January.

And that's confirmed cases. real cases least double.   Ain't happening. 

I would prefer professional opinion best practices actually dealing reality, wishful thinking. thing game want remember (9ers fan, sat front row). There's reason assume problems two years now. essentially flu virus.  


As H1N1, reffering cases UK Ireland £60m paid compensation. get eventually... enough people die off. Mask compliance bit worse south county beach communities. correlates political affiliation. Oh bad. thought another like celebrity died. saying she’s famous yknow, comparison. I'm you. Collage much fun. still school I'd pick extra major something major part examining vaccine safety conducting large scale studies examine potential long term effects. Although inherit risk new vaccines general, standard process new vaccines. example, 2014 HPV vaccine undergoing post-release trials Pfizer vaccine go through.

 stands right now, Pfizer vaccine passed levels vigorous clinical trials necessary release U.S.. Internationally, passed European trials required release European countries. basically means immediately safe vaccine currently market. demographic risk certain auto immune disorders, immunodeficienceies, allergies. worried ability take vaccine, primary care doctor able tell weather safe condition(s). 

People skeptical fast vaccine released, important understand millions scientist globally vaccine. Many companies/ research organizations signed agreements share data one organization's research team made break through, they'd required share information research teams. absolute latest. mRNA vax passed trials humans?

Moderna first, back May, there's ongoing research since 90s. 

When lot younger, friends would take sorts substances created labs legal oversight ever. bit older concerned taking massively tested vaccine seems daft. like thousands doctors already line. He's simply saying important people need right next months rich motherfucker. trust scientist doctors getting much random millionaire mean that's 1/6 population People don’t social distance flu season. prove point even football players richies get healthcare workers jump line due wealth. Good dude. Yes. dunno hitting 3k dead day pretty often now. Seems surgey get right away fuel conspiracy dipshits waits. get noble/looking good get publicly now. wouldn't.. ceo company made first vaccine. one would care took it. Thata even real point here. point trust product prove back it....by getting vaccine Can't wait see imaginary people would pissed single CEO trying fitst vaccine show confidence it. Nobody pissed idea one man holds big public role trying first. Remember Elvis getting vaccines TV caused tons fans trust them? There's lot people there. Best get cracking. make valid points, thanks sharing input. Immune Santa also charge taking photos. Lol good crotchfruit get special privileges fuck dumb ass baby Current estimates 15-20% US already COVID. 19k 500k Amazon employees US COVID far, they're actually lot better average American. expect Amazon magically shield employees outside infection too? No, really doesn't. implore work federal government decide wax poetic.

The fucking military needs handicap access buildings. Think that.

And think say ""Nah, get vaccinated, can't come in""? Got documentation that? crazy balcony full LEDs keep doors open saving life get keep Christmas!? face wife! gonna suck I'm glad vaccine look forward even midst worst numbers ever. believe us decide that. decide highest risk, high age groups decide lives worth taking resource not. may certainly decide forgo wait feel lived full life current quality life poor anyway. others probably feel much desperation staying alive younger person. 

Second, age argument slippery slope. logic, extreme view children first inoculated, even Healthcare workers.

Also many age group nursing homes suffering horrific quality life due quarantine, visits loved ones, low human contact. especially tough dementia understand one visits (this dad).  vaccination means loving human contact even months definitely worth it. We’ve flying summer. Lost sympathy assholes. We're even Christmas yet. We're seeing Thanksgiving Covid spike. way, would probably better society cut line possible death toll high enough. state could certainly pass law. Fuck, forgot one.

Believe science Holy smokes. That’s horrible. live head sand. Nope want see shit live.  Football. game mere citizens act like players Gods games religious event.? doubt jump, it'll taken laid feet like offerings left Gods! nine months loneliness, rather add two weeks ventilator? vaccines take long time trying eliminate diseases around decades never previously vaccinated against.

If every vaccine's first trial effective (as here) took decades develop.

The reason AIDS vaccine keep unsafe developments - nothing works. knows dirty little secrets pay silence  Hey there, Tony, go getting hopes music festival season like that! There's way majority people follow restrictions long, especially vulnerable vaccinated. good chunk ignoring mask mandates already without vaccine federal government power impose mandate chooses, via several methods. Huh. lockdown country [2018 due Someone work (I work/live small area) “the top three countries world approved vaccine TIME, means virus MAN MADE profit!” 

Yes referred UK, CA US “three biggest countries”. took LOT self control tell ways wrong. Didn’t want think “liberal snowflake” 🙃  Ok. Thanks. I'll keep eye learn more. everyone 60 vaccine, basically eliminate vast majority deaths hospitalizations? Naah, science told us 1987 totally cool open heart surgery new borns ***without anesthesia*** reasons.  Famous last words weird people like ""yeah keep wearing mask forever, totes cool normal"" act like we're crazy ones wanting wear mask post-vaccine lol Nice Producers reference. Got chuckle me! rare case wish cut line got video.

To increase public trust vaccine. imagine would happen America people stopped reproducing every major crisis. US would gigantic fertility drop 4+ years due WWII example. 

If choose helping pregnant mother's saving nursing home residents, redirect resources pregnant mother's - attack choosing procreate.  must toddlers. It’s even close comparison. said 9 months since masks required. Masks required outside like shoes amount time kids actually wear MUCH less shoes. really think is. many millions vaccines. biggest problem logistics. Everyone expects ceo already gotten shot. would feel comfortable took except previous reply said one hospital batch nurses given vaccine approximately 40% developed Bells less 6 hours. turns react emotionally dont read sound like idiot record: i'm antivax. think modern science incredible answer it:

I think worth reading vaccine taking it. really good article examples trials TGN1412 terrible reactions thalidomide vaccines, really unrelated. Yea especially said gonna take camera. he's switching kinda sus. isnt time gathering w Santa. 2021 still Santa Well, doctors nurses people got highest chance COVID touched, first vaccine. People like post demonstrate vastly touch people working class better human assholes cutting line Trump administration. Don’t worry. don’t know businesses work. Huh? He’s charge company developed it. *should* first line receive it. Besides, rich powerful people get first. That’s way world works. 

In world huge amount vaccine skepticism it’s nuts isn’t first guy taking it. can't wait go see friends stay inside another year. look comments controversial find ... sounds (not native English speaker). suppose position people believe science... people exactly ? get flat earthers maybe, even anti vaxx people claim science behind them, since using medical studies (usually wrong false). Even people deny global warming usually finding studies scientists cherry pick evidences phenomenon..

It's interesting way words weaponized sides. Reminds pro life pro choice. terrible choice words, one wants killer zero choice, seriously ask nuances ?

I guess wanted say trust process pharmaceutical companies develop validate vaccine, trust FDA check boxes giving green light ? maybe believe right scientific protocol used ? I'm ok that. 

I also remember long ago FDA approved quickly (in record time!) Purdue Pharma put market strong opiod (oxycodone) became responsible opiod crisis. different topic shows pharma companies driven profit (and wellness end customers) FDA perfect ...

That said believe everything done properly vaccine, since spotlight everyone needs win (strong pressure wall street, politics,.small business owners, artists, parents, ravers !), cautious... Wait seriously? dentist like one last places I'd want go right now. I'm curious they're makes comfortable? Besides mandate it, becomes political means “live life normally mask you’re out” that’s normal enough me.

I mean...no. Masks suck. I'm sorry hear that. horrible government bother shield overload patients. setup military triage hospitals ensure never forced go capacity. first night put full face makeup go eat Mexican food without masks/distancing friends make eyes hot line cook know pandemic truly lol could also show world taking shot vaccine another conspiracy erupt took placibo. Sure would small sample size effective vaccine is, billions data points side effects delivery mechanism. trust science, billions people world, could weird mutations DNA new delivery system ineffective.

I'm saying get vaccine. I'm saying ok weary new delivery mechanism, edge cases discovered yet historical data. still get vaccine alternative worse. wrong. conduct trial document everything happens. look compare control group. similar numbers people developed bells vaccine placebo group. Turns following 30k + people develop diseases. second injection also supposed quite unpleasant many people.

Most vaccine side effects - include anything sore arm, feeling warm muscle aches - signs immune response - got mild form disease. Honestly, write script unnervingly climactic this. Vaccines finally rolling simultaneously US's significant revered holiday right around corner cases ever part world. kids would love that, too. wonder Canada stands timeline. wanna get back normal vaccine quantities say we’ll reach way guys bet does. waits forever see possible effects releasing drug.

Of course not. also release drugs year they're developed. release absolutely rubber stamped there's worldwide crisis going that's killing millions. ordinary circumstances studies would lasted years. 

Saying that's *not* something concerned ridiculous. policies place *for reason* they're waived crisis. random thought. know lot doctors nurses participated trial. It’s usually information regarding trial close proximity it. I’m sure would conflict interest precluding CEO participating drug trial, don’t know certain I’m lazy look right now. would imagine governments big businesses wouldn’t want vaccine issues since it’s going injected everyone world also themselves. People groups like walking bags money, wouldn’t want make vaccine flammable. like said, they’re going get vaccine themselves. big evil business man would still want vaccine safe people give money instead dying virus vaccine.

(Note: I’m man average intelligence second coming Einstein. thoughts it) right, using exact wrong term. worry. It'll go away April, like magic. already know Seahawks ain’t gonna win shit year. disrespect Russ He's probably risk age group. He's line ""He said took sell doses""....

It's lose/lose idiots either way. twice effective Flu vaccine! farfetched. Big pharma shady. 85% engaged illegal activities, including Pfizer. 1. that's works. 95% effective, 100%

2. know vaccine prevents symptoms, necessarily transmission. wear mask, may get virus healthy pass others

3. vaccine takes week start effective, fully effective 2nd dose 3 weeks later Elites don’t take vaccines especially lethal vaccine. Welcome depopulation get line cattle. I'll also choose guy's dead mom. exactly. think climate doubt, would best took show trusted it. article stats although haven’t looked it. “An Associated Press-NORC Center Public Affairs Research poll illustrated stark vaccine schism. According poll, roughly one four Americans say get vaccinated. another one four say remain unsure won’t get inoculated vaccine made available via largest vaccination program U.S. history.”
It broke 50% republicans say won’t 25% democrats say won’t. 
No idea validity poll though Good that’s exception norm vaccine isn’t safe, like never see Bill Gates wearing mask. wow lets suck fucking billion dollar dick... health bad need ICU bed, probably never fully recover anyway. Love Yeah unfortunately, rare thing. One colleagues masks vaccines.. understand her. Also requires multiple people involved conspiracy. Otherwise, he’s asshole, don’t believe, way; something said impact taking vaccine seen vote confidence. Basically, he’s fucked either way. might well take vaccine, seen line jumper, able live see outcome. also believe will. soon Pfizer press room empty, won’t take long, he’ll get first dose quietly back room. Ordered deaths? still haven’t answered question. would sent patients? Yes is. let happen. chose live there. accepted system. rules. inadequate medical system. people reject reason. 

When die, due inaction. 

Do something it. Alternatively, don't.... die. want old job back :( Bro you’re retarded straight I've morbid curiosity restrictions going look coming now. think people prefer lift mask mandates first, others would rather bring things closer normal first keep masks. drop restrictions quickly, gradually it? level people passing triggers things? questions things I'm even sure opinion (okay true. I'd way sooner keep masks open things first) Exactly make product always eat dog food can. claim see made time. think made mistake, understandable given little knew virus time best ways respond it. NYC one first cities outbreak US, makes sense would especially bad Trump literally said exact thing... would exceedingly, mean exceedingly rare vaccine diminish viral infection diminish ability transmit. reality, probably won’t carrier you’re vaccinated. Secondly, die anything time. Including viruses lived thousands years. 

It’s indefinitely, article even puts cap late 2021 absolute worst case scenario reality acceptable amount death (just modern things) longer justify restrictions destroying peoples lives further. that’s reality. 45 care get nasty side effects vaccine. Gonna sit front TV miserable physically 24 hrs happy mentally immune cries dojo laugh battlefield.

4% get diarrhea? Sign up. Nausea? Ginger tea come. Fever chills? Fucking blankets comfy chair. Gonna get Hygge fuck.  nothing, continue live life way want to, wearing mask, social distancing etc. willing take chances EMT hold wall hours (been there, done that) ultimately die. population:
23 per 100,000 people 0.023% 
Vaccine:

But ya maybe skipping vaccine keep getting Bells. Considering ICU capacity grew meet demand, quadrupled 500 2000, numbers shows many beds *needed* normal times. ever challenged court?

Ahhh reddit! Definitely. want take something rushed. person charge rushing first take show 100% faith Man making 8 dollars hour new york minimum wage 15 got problems covid. PETA Healthcare. That's good way put CA population nearly 40 million FL half population nearly amount cases deaths. always get worked defending somebody ordered deaths 50000 people? don’t understand couldn’t required sort advanced contact tracing trial participants, worked conjunction health authorities try determine R effective actual versus placebo trial participants based chains transmission involved study. 

While might extremely precise, likely would enough provide estimate. I'm curious this. ever going enforced? systems place give people who've vaccine sort ""passport"" verifiable document? Sure could. Maybe could driver major systemic change fix it! Either wait Die, know, whatever. “Pfizer’s CEO vaccinated frontline healthcare workers elderly citizens.”

Y’all crazy don’t think could headline. buy he’s saying, let’s real here. love eat rich. I’d still like know patients supposed go. Long term care nurses constantly working. field hospitals going find long term care nurses care COVID patients? heck patients supposed go, guaranteed families volunteering take home. Never get high supply. 100% children tested post infection showed blood biomarkers vessel damage. means future know. could temporary could represent increased cardiovascular risk. know.

I've heard children early mild symptoms referred neurologists fighting infection. Somewhat rare. difference contagiousness covid (including trained hospital staff) elongated length stays fraction those. It’s winter illness accidents plus covid quickly push things top. It’s county’s medical director said there’s multi-hospital crisis, EMS failing, 70% hospitals operating surge procedures. happen every winter doesn’t happen every hospital nearby. Earlier pandemic places overflow to... younger BIL works covid unit. one hand, supposedly takes covid seriously lost 100+ patients. hand, thinks government’s response repress us keep us fear. 

It’s quite depressing, knowing husband take seriously does. trust experts, wear masks, careful (outdoor, masked) social gatherings, counting days til get vaccinated help keep asthmatic son safer - vs BIL, thinks living lives pre-covid 2019.

It really sucks seeing know better better. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Look one famous examples vaccines uncaught side effects, swine flu one 70s. One case GB per 100k, even given, *you'd still 100x likely die covid* (at conservative estimate him) die bc GB. purely human irrationality, devil know better one don't, even worst case realistic scenario far less dangerous danger hand. still people die infected. know vaccines prevent spread infection. That's continue wear masks social distance indefinitely.

Those people much right life want turn zombies like rest us mutagen vaccine activated first harvest moon... taking story. taking is. Bad pr move. Take shot. irrational people end line anyway. months even make decision. Convincing moment time moot. Americans go virtual Christmas. get together regardless CDC health provider advice. mean dead people's governor ? I'm NYC want able go Met (without worrying near people.) Even that, want go Mets game! Yep! want people thinking took dead grandma's dose. bastards  Republican Senators 100% cut line, though. Yes, reason didn’t use map would better choice.  Rather get long-covid, you. Yes, federal government bar access building someone refuses vaccine. Since 1944 power enact regulations ""to prevent introduction, transmission, spread communicable diseases foreign countries States possessions, one State possession State possession.”

So totes, like, insane!

Ah, Reddit. produced Belgium ain't getting year either Bless you! oh thought pfizer made Man you’re harsh hahaha. It’s little late get seniors exercise regimens. Trust - completely agree exercise plus healthy eating would solve huge amount world’s mental physical problems. building habits takes time vaccine showing great promise efficacy. likely option prevent spread vaccines us then. agree leaders need model good behavior, people complaining county spreading conspiracies virus breaking rules since April. never cared anything bars full service dining. conspiracy theorists gonna field day one China suppressed information first weeks pandemic still commit huge lockdown handled seriously. can't say US European countries though. higher would expected general population

Rather important point, that. lol Actually vaccine causes extreme allergic reactions many people history VARIOUS allergic reactions. necessarily safe everyone. care field hospital?

Personally, I'd care first market big win now. Current exec board would mostly long gone set life either way. legal repercussions. 

But part I'm joking, odds vaccine fine... hope best. understood responding first time thank Thanks sharing thanks hard work.

Continue share story continue urge voters educated vote for. It’s avoid future. enough. even close. received Emmy....come on. upsets people see around go work careful. Even couple three months get us winter. anything, sloppier, warned, less. vaccine blessing that's going come late many. *some. bad anti vaxxers. try make people afraid exaggerated claims. celebrities took changing opinion stupid

You’re right, stupid. many people stupid. Jesus Christ. idea going through. stories speaking people say goodbye spouses children...damn much...

You're amazing work, even though know lot go through. friend mine mentioned heard ICU LA area lost oxygen few, know possible.

Not sure else say stay strong. We're rooting you, stay safe Luckily trust not. Long term consequences. million person trial won’t tell anything whether long term effects. I’ll probably take vaccine, accepting risk intelligent decision acknowledge risk there. many people see lightning fast development time midst pandemic induced economic disaster don’t question it. 

Do need remind long history short term benefits long term costs. Especially comes medical effects? Lead paint. Leaded gasoline. Thalidomide? 

I’m autistic. I’ve got reason hate anti vaxxers you. anti vaxxer mean “accept everything you’re told people history motive bend truth”. 

This rushed out, it’s better alternative, don’t pretend isn’t calculated risk. Wondering Bill Covid yet. Fauci spending holiday family. Bill 

Trump tweet -- nice meeting Attorney General Bill Barr White House...... per letter, Bill leaving Christmas spend holidays family,"" Vaccine's take years trials developing anything like that. almost due funding. funding issue vaccine entire world pumping money it. human trials also factors larger vaccines it. “We totally control.” Careful now, ""birds"" watching us *sorts controversial* 

👀 Poor guy rely tens millions dollars worlds best healthcare. brave. Yeah, think key expectation management. exciting news sure, many us want get going keep part another months least. I'm hopeful month two, start seeing noticeable impact terms cases deaths. everyone saying he’s getting doesn’t fully trust - case wouldn’t make lot sense take saline shot pr? insurance world that's gonna cover massive American hospital bills. need concerts man. sounds ridiculous, seeing bands saved life killed me. rough :/ mental state never low. people course. make sure hold accountable dumb things definitely vote people continue fuck us /S think gotten vaccine generate trust, would probably positive impact company's stock market price well.

But underlying health issues, correct would ""cutting line"". die tomorrow, company would still function. 

I think people decision affected this, distrustful vaccine already distrustful. want defeat virus roll dice vaccine; already taking big risk vaccine running rampant. risk want assume? People get sick miss school parents vaccinated tend better education wise yet go never got sick real. I'm shocked almost like smart still fucking idiot. I’m sure aren’t alone article suggests happening widely. hope maybe find ideas getting help. Take care yourself. Super misleading. really feel family MRI wasn’t going save him. line thing true even settings. I'm covid nurse folks skeptical it. said, even covid unit there's line. gotta wait ED staff wear ppe constantly dealing new folks icu staff aerosolizing procedures critical covid patients. cough wear ppe risk lower. late adoptors I'll get mine sooner. Tried post ELI5 - really sure ask tbh:

This could quite understanding mRNA vaccines work, got far:

1. Pfizer Moderna vaccines contain mRNA encapsulated structure allows mRNA penetrate human cells.
2. mRNA uses cells protein synthesis mechanism induce cell create protein close enough match spike protein naturally encapsulates Sars-cov-2 virus, immune reaction vaccine created spike proteins ensure rapid immune reaction SC2 virus spike protein
3. mRNA vaccines need maintained low temperatures throughout existence maintain integrity encapsulating structure.

Why go trouble instead steps 1 2 lab delivered vaccine exclusively spike protein? missing? Haha expect government actually take accountability. Oh silly duck. take next 60 years apologizing COVID response that's maybe. He’s CEO Pfizer. He’s *THE* scumbag millionaire pharmaceutical CEO psychiatrist worked vaccinated four times show immunity. said horrible anomaly terrified many people line work (autism DD) refused MMR vaccine increased risk exposure much more. me. Give shot asap two doses,
There millions shy away taking won't.

Shortsighted best. Science checks out. LED lights everywhere Korea resisted CoVid pretty well recently. children forced... riiiggghhttt. That’s like celebrity Pepsi sponsor saying don’t drink Pepsi want everyone else chance drink some. say ""HIPAA""? Eh, there's like 26% chance we'd know. nothing. doesnt work Trump mentions  Honestly, probably would've smarter cut line get right away, make post it. Maybe he's viewed little bit dick, least there's also ""I 100% faith this"" look put vaccine doubters rest Maybe hurry get reason, hmmm. prove virus apply compensation vaccine fund like white people harmed expect much pays 5c dollar im told. OOoooookay there. even want product... definitely fishy all.   Many Redditors social distancing years now, excuse needed! I’ll wait get vaccine gets it. 'Force' gives away. boy Georgia calls grandfather Belgian nursing home.

""Grandpa, Santa give Covid too?""

""Totally"" like sentiment language off. trust science, believe science, religion; ""accept evidence"" maybe better way put it.

""I accept evidence vaccine safe effective"" [interactive map MSDH shows beds many occupied covid patients.  There’s proving random kids picking infections from. doesn’t make sense say airborne virus won’t spread ... anything breathes (in range infectivity). claim anecdotal study cited small sample size sampled locations taking measures stop spread. 

I see Pascal’s wager sorts. treat things spread infection even not. involves similar protocols see everywhere else. Unfortunately potential side effects could take many years appear.  want that's problem tbh, get covid then.  willing travel Florida Texas see concert, I'm pretty sure could next summer. Florida barely restrictions right - doubt they'll bother anything herd immunity reached. seem like expert this, enlighten me, CEO normally do? never said gave flu, said makes sick get it. family actual history adverse reactions vaccines. Mostly allergies different components. 

However, find absurd people like tell happens inside body foreign substances introduced. I've done plenty substances universe offer us free chains people call sanity reality, pretty good understanding different substances affect different people differently. also understand side effects, contraindications, adverse reactions, actual flu symptoms. understand, apparently, proper reading comprehension. Assuming makes ass u. 

Let's see top Google blurb cdc says ""Common side effects flu shot include soreness, redness, and/or swelling shot given, headache (low grade), fever, nausea, muscle aches, fatigue. flu shot, like injections, occasionally cause fainting."" Oh hey look that. Fever, nausea, muscle aches, fatigue. things ***commonly feel getting fucking flu shot***. know wash hands. know vampire sneeze cough. think you/us fucking disgusting covid, always kept sanitizer deck shaking haters' hands. also issues wearing masks feel ill, even pandemic. must awful.

People like jump throats people legitimate reasoning behind getting trivial vaccinations part antivaxx issue. become emotionally connected issue can't even remove look things objectively single comment internet. 

You soap box back, now. Laughs Floridian. air need stationary, need enough LEDs illuminate much duct air move 30 seconds. disagree, I’m anti-vaxxer (not calling one either). works scientists can’t concerned conspiracy theories let dictate does. didnt say he’d never take it, isn’t front line worked get it. Theres time still for
Marketing best fight anti-vax theories Finally good news guy. I’d like visit CoVid free America next fall  CanSino based viral vector method. similar AstraZeneca vaccine. want go Disney. I’m AP lives less hour away haven’t since February. see concerning. One UK, US, Canada Bahrain approved vaccine. That's 4 different countries. Dr Fauci one famous doctors whole pandemic said take vaccine. 

Secondly he's old he's generally lower priority list. He's essential worker reason take everyone else. Also he's CEO realistically major role actual making vaccine. role corporate side things like zoom meetings various people, meetings company directors general managing company whole. scientists ground pfizer ones actually worked vaccine. Even took see people making big deal lut say he's lying anything sell product. Worse PR shit care appearance insider trading make millions others losses company elites back they're product setting aside 20 shots hundreds millions sake handful first responders? 

Sorry pass muster me. could vaccine 100 percent. Thats thing deal with. Science great, perfect. safest bet everyone that's able take it, take it. Also mother pointed me, even asymptomatic first time, next time catch might bad reaction. also may damaged heart lungs even without symptoms. could make second infection worse. Maybe get right away. may even last group get it. think should. There's one CEO, CEO takes execs? Dr. Fauci cut line? President, White House staff, congresspeople, governors, football players, celebrities... many people serve examples want reassurance vaccine safe. makes sense save PR vaccines highest risk people get opportunity fires require fuel. Or... he's lying it. We'll never know. Lol would even know did? mean come on, would anyone blindly believe this? mean, disagree there. We're fucking hazard everyone shot arm way get incompetent country control, it. I'm terrified badly handled dangerous go even slightly immuno-compromised. I'm vitamin deficient sleep apnea almost 40. avoid people like (haha... *sob*) plague. MET open actually. bunch friends went. need buy tickets advance wear mask.  Bro, vaccines don’t limit reaction pathogen. make immune *do* encounter wild, you’ll fight quickly even gets chance infect you. can’t infect you, can’t transmit it. That’s whole point vaccines, reduce spread disease.

So course you’re protecting around get vaccine 1) there’s 95% chance won’t get virus (in case) 2) don’t get infected, can’t pass others. conspiracy nuts lost cause. want target people fence. I’ve heard lot people aren’t anti-vax express want “wait see happens” getting it. people convinceable. One make educated guess, right? that?  fact is, nothing FHM ever recommended designed stop spread infection. fact specifically chosen allow infection keep spreading, ""slow, controlled"" 

Well, that's true atleast. virus wont stopped there's vaccine leadership, advise world governments, said governments seek advice. limit, they're charge anything co-ordinating disseminating information funding research. government wants rid kick whenever. can't dictate policy, can't forcefully put x practice. speak, long allowed to. 

As anti-science bit, tjis sub science-naive. Wear mask that's magic cure-all. scientific statement masks reduce chances infection, go stand room infected person couple hours. Black white thinking, ignoring world million shades grey. Interspersed doom porn fetishism usual jaded, viscous misanthropy get redditors. See Brazil, easy way hard way. Seems like growing number Brazilians want hard way. guess they'll get immunity one way another attitude! Hope cost many loved ones... exactly said intervuew yesterday. taken based stance ethics department standing line, changing position based importance setting example establishimg trust, *will* getting it. full answer kind got cut end bit really acknowledged interviewer. Suuuuure difference make government boss?  forced forced Yes that’s good! keep shoes outside live apartment maybe bin door. think guys careful outings ok. make sure people live same. surprise expect *Ooooh* tell people waiting hours line Xbox's employees bought stock first. think Walmart. That's okay. everyone concerned vaccine ""crazy"" thinks got microchips floating it. merely concerned speed developed potential long term effects. CEO Pfizer taking vaccine would go long way convincing *those* people. Gotta love easily Redditors fall basic PR campaigns.

Cyberpunk'd again, Reddit. saying husband last night! learned much channel! assume source that? People talk ass raw numbers here. USA isn’t top ten per capita deaths even (still bad remotly worst) even quarentine I'm sure trusts vaccine..so much willing sell lot shares moment news released. wanted let others chance owning Pfizer stocks. nice him. wish. many people pushing this, backwards government could never fathom actually something help people. Gotta bail airlines corporations starving families still buy plane tickets something? There's logic it. Oh ok people bully others make fun people hesitant vaccine, people refuse take join dark anti vaxxer movement. 

A lot people taking wait see approach bullying news change that. People scared, anti vaxxers, people simply nervous take yet.

The issue force scared people taking something likely start blaming lot things vaccine. want see emergency orders stop vaccinating people pending investigation, start forcing people taking vaccine. mean stock would tumble. would much like avoid that. mRNA vaccine. stands messenger. encoding specific information body create immune response covid, traditional vaccine comes risks contracting covid. enter nucleus modify DNA way.

These mRNA vaccines future modified bunch different diseases use underlying mechanism known studied years. worried slightest scientists multiple rounds review messed one up, covid spike version vaccine type passed many clinical trials. TIL skip meetings. company those. BRB submitting anonymous feedback... Vaccinations proven stop spread reduce symptoms afraid ;-). (joking anti-vaxer) know happy suspicious putting first think called integrity human decency. Something like that. Since guidelines written yet, impossible tell time. Knows them, yes. skepticism worth taking dose frontline worker, no. didnt say he’d never take People keep comparing Spanish flu attacked young people high death rates argueably infectious disease human history super low death rates almost always asymptomatic.

I’m sure Spanish flu asymptomatic people would spread similar wildfire globalized world to. rolling week local hospitals offering hospital workers families. agree wearing masks Oof, conspiranuts aren’t going take this. Stone fucking cold *He* didn’t create anything. CEOs facilitate, don’t actually work. mention partnership BioNTech Vaccines almost never dangerous. skeptical literally means stupid. Imagine grammar nazi 2020. instead delayed thousands health workers trust vaccine enough take it, CEO trust it. Fixed, thanks. saying yea....this ain't safe yet. Imma sit watch may waiting version 2 vaccine Laudable, no. people questioning safety vaccine, last thing want deal people saying can't safe even people developed use it. Please, cut line save idiot's lives sanity. governments distribution network. People still need get vaccinated. Governments need keep ordering everyone’s vaccinated run people want get vaccinated. people scared mRNA vaccines decide eat J&amp;J, that’s less units sold Pfizer. actually exact opposite. absolutely confident product, next step inspire confidence trust and/or reason trust you. someone works clinical trials. They're extremely confident vaccine made market. incredibly regulated industry. Anyone doubts, please look process testing Investigational Product human subjects regulations inspections take place. He's also vitally important vaccination project. Makes sense puts health risk given importance (and executives Pfizer taking it). city? thing realistically probably much role vaccine corporate side things like calling meetings directors, zoom meetings general managing company overseeing operations. actual scientists pfizer bigger role vaccine said jest times thing bring us hyper-polarized times would common enemy. thinking legitimate extraterrestrial invasion, pandemic sort fit bill impacted politics exact opposite way hoped.

Logically, means ever invaded aliens, conservatives will

A) Start invasion denying aliens even exist,

B) Claim invasion Soros-funded recognizing it’s real, 

C) Eventually lick alien boots attempt save expense, dooming us  less people one State. It’s easy country relatively rich homogenous Yeah US vast able implement serious level. Also work would jobs eliminated due economic downturn would taken care financially health care still intact. 100% covered wages, job/position level held place, stimulus injected economy, health care. It’s difficult government say people can’t work job spent 15 years building working might potentially eliminated forever prospect finding another job responsibility. Gotta extend serious financial assistance things going lock down.  maybe took vaccine telling anyone yet. hate thought, do. Vaccines limited. don’t know someone 80s 90s really given them. hate saying that. know one. possible job force take get fired?  know people voted Trump still take Covid seriously would get vaccine first opportunity. make sense? Nope. people whole make sense more? Also nope. states, like CO, require majority vote people raise taxes. literally can’t give people money cause nothing give. need call names actual arguments. response topic again, that's responded to.

I specialized doctor clearly either. Like us first clue ingredients copy pasted, lol. could copy pasted ingredients toothpaste even understand difference.

In reality know safe fast tracked vaccines are, time human guinea pigs give answer years.

Arguments like ""It's saline, lipids, mRNA, sugar RIGHT NOW"" ridiculous would insult human intelligence even attempted respond, pass. Kind like announced sold millions dollars stock mere HOURS released statement saying 95% effective vaccine mid November? Hilarious, got rofl, thanks!  Depends much people taking seriously. shut businesses let people gather freely places get worst worlds damage economy stop surge. country asked make sacrifices, every time close restaurants shut schools, masks enforced everywhere, can't leave town people asked meet home numbers gone times.

The good option films (and willing executives) getting vaccine. Release YouTube (comments turned off, JFC) include single statement saying:

He's saying he's fine killing someone plane wear mask Nah. me. general public look at.they hear nameless scientists confirming efficacy vaccine, unconvinced. see celebrities taking it, also sponsoring scientist, guarantee people board it.

Is right we're state people trust celebs scientists? No. there's denying influence country. 

If want general public willing take vaccines, use nameless figures emotional tie them. use famous figure people adore degree trust. 

Someone like obama. Ellen. Oprah. Beyonce. rappers. Etc etc. agree this, see damn near everybody else board (taking hardcore antivaxers aside).

You cannot deny fact despite importance scientists, make little less chump change compared celebs. Celeb rich people listen them. least influence.

Do guys remember campaign dozens dozens celebs encouraged us wear masks? helped lot establishing mask policy. course anti maskers , ridiculed it.

Same thing happen anti vaxxers celebs get board this. spitting cold facts convince americans, which
1, trust government 
2, mostly ignorant people general. believe mostly politicians ideas whole take vaccine publicly display, also think circus like. know influence morons better anyone.

That mean whoever takes vaccine moron course. speaks fact people make health decisions based whether favorite politician takes vaccine. Marketing works everywhere guess.

I'm letting people trust vaccine wait us trust process gotten ours. trust it- really wait year long term effects think irrational want display confidence new vaccine process.

Why? vaccine go required clinical trials?

This easily closely watched vaccine history. Everyone brother analyzing press releases studying whatever available scientific data History seen negative examples

Could provide examples? Pandemrix vaccines shown significant number serious side effects? (And that's assuming Pandemrix blame Narcolepsy one really able determine especially since narcolepsy increases also seen China flu season vaccines However, people seen effects Thalidomide life time, irrational want see person selling vaccine they're confident it.

First off- Thalidomide drug vaccine. understand lot vaccines interact body drug candidates.

Second- Thalidomide reason many current drug vaccine safety efficacy standards today. Absolutely does. pre-cancer appointment scheduled LA hospital check status early February, probably cancelled soon, second shutdown July. Stockpile cheap food offer advance chance place ""everything shutting cupboards empty I'll buy what's available  Question. post implies human cells start express virus spike protein, correct?

It's saline, lipids, mRNA, sugar RIGHT NOW. ask scary sounding lipids, fats INGREDIENTS PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE?

Healthcare workers first line right now. Like trust issue, honestly we're gonna near enough vaccines everyone actually wants one get yet.  Come think it, that's probably Bolsonaro anti-vax. way save face actually vaccines. belief statement negative safety Covid-19 vaccine - seen tens millions people (maybe hundreds millions) including skeptics looking reason take vaccine - resulted precisely zero people deciding take vaccine. Especially considering, like reddit, people barely glanced headline?

That's honest belief? rushing dragging? probably fine, nonetheless 9 months *extremely* fast. way knowing if, couple months line, there's going longer term issues. enough time test that, animal testing goes far. absolute *best*, maybe 7-9 months forewarning animal test subjects couple months human test subjects. saw episode! know favorite singer starting tour March, kind doubt even willing postpone several months.

You want healthy alive good country considering role across multiple administrations. Also don’t want people saying making bullshit arguments didn’t get it. would-be adjacent states. particular doctor got medical license suspended. Sorry sorry. think everyone position power “ wait turn” it’s safest move politically. resources available stay safer others really don’t need vaccine right away. looks like “heroes” brave thinking others. can't frickin wait normal mundane drudgery.

You’re definitely alone. can't wrap head around anyone wanting end. much death suffering. feel like always goal, vaccine. know many people seriously expected would go away ""if everyone wore masks"". scared long term side effects dont know yet paranoia, count supposed civil subreddit seems totally unfair many completely uncivilized actions.

There's simply nice way act towards selfish, narcissistic, sociopathic individuals. Good news, that's 3 days away birthday.  Sand people relevant vaccine won’t available public quite time, time would likely take along millions vaccines companies available too. still don’t trust vaccine millions already took CEO taking vaccine dumb excuse find another one take later on. That’s works unfortunately. also curious ability still transmit virus disappointed don’t enough data draw conclusion. enough people get vaccine clear, less. Plus it’s like would mandate masks people hadn’t received vaccine, wouldn’t go well. It’d really hard even determine public. legit told us ""stopping spread"" impossible otherwise would have. absolutely ZERO focus personal accountability family, ""wear masks, cases keep rising people blame them.""

I sometimes hear say ""slowing spread"", feel like even THAT'S dumb goal point measures vaccine. yeah 1/6 good start, drop bucket. point not... unless doctors 80 years old. well expensive though, afford fight hotel Guernsey week 2 air bridge, outbreak happened done. can’t began explain easy get money purchase agreement already place

Our community government cleared shit May kept borders predominantly closed nobody around us could bar Guernsey got outbreak recently. Yeah think it'd better publicly took instead. doubtful outside major developed countries there'll high vaccination rates. kid 2.

I willing bet kids.

People like love flying kids business class.. times. sure hope right.

Last time California locked 6 months even opened gyms...and shut 2 months. keep thinking nurse advised couple herbs ""essential"" oils would cure sons meningitis, course get cured kid died.

Trust science come profession Cut line? scarcity supply not? 3 friends pregnant 1 baby (3 days ago). others due March/April. 3/4 babies 100% planned. You’re cunt know right? meets eye SinoVac CEO took vaccine, along team worked it? stories going hear winter. vacancy needless deaths, COVID stuff easily treatable ER. probably trust child 2.

You're ignorant. one little confused CEO taking it? mean yeah cutting line, two doses millions rolled out. anyone else see red flag here? Yeah fuck increasing effectiveness herd immunity cost one dosage amirite? Lmao Ozzy gets it, might fucked. 2020, sense decency? chick never get vaccine allowed hospital. word looking ""elections"". Anyone downvoting parent. understand problem.

You can't explain kid talking yet. 

People ignorant jerks internet.  Yeah, I’m currently junior year. Please tell political. Surprised moronic slob didn’t take Well, I’m cubano start with. Can’t speak anyone else looks like several others complaining said they’re Latino well. Oh yeah. Med tech real there’s whole cadre people support doctors technology requires engineering skills. mental gymnastics thread hilarious believe took even said did. think last several months trials for?  wants wait see side effects. carrie ann got too! flyest fly girl sound pretty ignorant think me. properly conducted lockdown, guaranteed income massive mandatory vaccination saves everyone - entire civilization.

What people, thinking yourselves, assuming everyone else thinks selfishly do? don't. think everyone besides ourselves, really see us nightmare together. ligislation place this. Mandatory life sentences anyone found queue jumping vaccine Even without vaccine hospitals, covid 19 kill enough people wipe us  Pfizer CEO needed vaccine development distribution. key worker. don’t think anyone force another take vaccine, every reason terminate person’s employment, would surely seen danger patients care. Anyone believes idiot terrible short term memory. test vaccine take group people region decent chance catching virus. split group, giving placebo one hald actual vaccine other.

After certain ammount time count number people caught groups. vaccine-group significantly less infected, vaccine works.

In process, checking got strain. mean yeah, young would wasteful give someone important risk  Nope Uh suddenly dont want cut line either. Let know guy takes it. Memphis taking blow Desoto know many PhD's various disciplines Science

That sounds convincing. family works prison may exposed inadvertently babysitting. Fuck awe science one thing, people skeptical little afraid entirely different type vaccination development another. know physicians studied MCB UG, development something take heart. impacts impacts normal person, yet they're still approaching caution learned school genetic cellular tech.

Are entitled wanting propagate risk tolerance onto others? vax/anti-vax debate ignorance. new everyone, anything observant skeptical appreciative knowledgeable science. meant say want controlled Bill gates Think antivaxxers different explanation this. 40,000 people got vaccine phase 3 trial. people drop like flies. think we're good Cuomo Folded accepting $18m/yr employees making minimum wage, problem that! worries me, saying 95% vaccinated stop restrictions? we’re never going get there. guy could easily go TV get shot containing placebo vitamins one would know difference. would easy fake- especially PR stunt.

You know people faking? Multiple clinical trials tens thousands participants.

Seriously- person believes CEO getting shot proves anything dumber sack rocks.  like Dorothy Mantooth!   *cries American* thought perhaps might substance article, looks unmitigated brown-nosing. anyone really surprised?  60%? want herd immunity don’t need 90+ I'm getting vaccine whether takes not. read studies trust science. Strategic direction company. Usually involves organising working c-suite employees final say ins tray directions. They’re also typically responsible answering BoD investors regarding decisions. Day day means meetings meetings meetings. smaller companies also review decisions provide final approval certain things experience. genius generates gravity. that's 730k+ dead already.

There already 1.6 million dead. many excess deaths directly counted. rich privileged people's guv! Correct. vaccine could approved month ago.

But FDA gonna FDA. Thankfully Trump finally kicked ass told stop playing games would start firing one-by-one jobs. Saved **thousands** lives move.

It take decades FDA CDC regain respect they've lost - ever happens all. Firstly, always happens second injection. Secondly, that's thought ever say hard crack tooth sign immune response, one might little hoped for, individuals like immune system overreact good day perhaps something best avoided healthy individuals get ill. trust doctors regard. think overdid botox face lifts.  Go it. might. We'll see. plan taking point, now. 

Probably fact every night local news keep talking fda whatever fast tracking get sooner. local news saying it, cnn fox whatever

The pfizer names it. put company name vaccine. 

And again, go it. really mind waiting, I'll wait long need to. 

I'm also waiting awhile buying ps5 get day-one bugs get good supply chain going I'm stressing trying get one. vaccine too? praising big PHARMA got it. completely agree. understand Japan/Olympics subs, people downvote comments state Olympics possibility. possibility--they sure going happen. question is, many spectators let in. But, state---if vaccinate pop March-June let vaccinated guests, honestly fine. here. already struggling 3 year old son 9month girl daycare. relief week working home stuff like that. Emotions wife already going roof (most certainly aided 9 months sleep deprivation)

Can anyone tell daycare closed? feels like punishment parents think fool.

If tens thousands people clinical trial convince you- one CEO would- believe science- believe conspiracy theories.

Seriously- CEO could easily get placebo vitamin shot instead vaccine- would convince you. Meanwhile one going successfully fake multiple clinical trials tens thousands participants- refuse believe. Dude, vaccine type RELEVANT dumb fuck! doesn’t inactivated virus. 🤦🏻‍♂️ History repeats regardless. Women played significant roles ww2. 

Approximately 400,000 U.S. women served armed forces. 800,000 women served Soviet Union. 

Most US women allowed serve combat unit due public opinion. Soviet women, contrast, served fighter pilots, tank drivers, antiaircraft gunners etc. He's CEO though, important time show everyone important taking vaccine  absolutely 99.97% chance vaccine effective without side effects. represents 3 10,000 people long term side effects. likely would shown existing trials (40,000 people total Pfizer Moderna, expected 12 people long term side effects, actual number ZERO). Certainly young healthy dude, turn line millions people, chances potential side effects discovered approximately zero time vaccine available you. Furthermore, 99.97% survival rate cite leaves possibility hospitalization long term consequences disease. Again, single person affected vaccine trials way even comes close debilitating consequences covid survivors age suffered.

Now may point vaccine 95% effective, prevented deaths long term effects coronavirus, taking 99.97% survival rate (with fraction permanently disabled survivors) turning possible brain?

Is possible polite discussion things? know ask lot I’m really worried implying we’ll deal restrictions forever Thanksgiving Covid spike may happen weeks. takes time get sick exposure, sometimes 10 days 14 days. time somebody critical often takes another week two. Many people sick right got sick around Halloween. dreamed tonight that... socially distancing flip side incentives really bad behaviour, stupid theoretical argument. Plenty states refusing impose restrictions last minute hospitals well past point collapse, they're intentionally largely Republican partisan politics. vaccine fluke medical staff dropping dead like flies vaccinated...we're fucked😱 really feel athletes shot others. really really sucks train hard get chance compete.

It would best athletes coaches everyone else watches television. much global superspeader potential.

But, I'm totally honest, point real struggle force care Olympics there's many burning problems. doesn’t mean follow restrictions forever, it? Exactly. really think people going freak headline ""In show confidence, Pfizer CEO first take recently approved COVID vaccine."" No. That's would expect. let get fucked, itll come back around fuck innocent people go mingle without caring can't taste.

It's like saying fuck antivaxxers, cause problem. not, everyone's problem. Guinea* personally really hope aren’t year now, imagine won’t nearly strict now. mRNA vaccines alter part genome. use existing cell machinery producing proteins produce spike protein virus. cell machinery located outside nucleus, genome located. mRNA interact genome. Every single protein produced body mRNA one point proteins naturally produced mRNA template. Nice burn 😂 haven’t read science, way development done widely available. Please stop pushing horseshit like this. think still restrictions year won’t strict Rewarding incompetent, whether leaders people, America's motto. sad getting downvoted majority reddit's user base American sign trial? Wonder why.... *""But condom tight, like feeling use it. Look, even know condoms work, think literally tyranny women want make pregnant ask wear one. buy ultra-thin material make condoms actually work - people even say thing see put one on; safety, compliance. Fucking sheeple.""*

They get vaccine last.  havent seen outrage preferential treatment. you?

I'm genuinely curious, trying confrontational think happen. need two doses spaced takes time build immunity. Except live world, people doubt vaccine. take it. Hopefully temporary media goes back reporting spikes. [If considering vaccine, watch video see shouldn't. already decided want vaccine, watch back objections nebraska, well. today less 500 new cases first time since october 12th. screen shot linked, see fall Meanwhile White House... Wow interesting!  They're already managing fine. North Dakota news lately, guess what? cases plummeted, mask wearing social distancing. system bent, break. vaccine then. generalizing. Depending path vary consequently pay vary. Getting BSN programs challenging. Getting BSN challenging. making 6 figures hcol cities common. Many top ranked hospitals gonna hire people without BSNs nurses. would take something like smallpox probably get everyone page .. one's gonna take look say ""it's like chickenpox guys"" Fauci says America get herd immunity late Spring see not. Considering virus relatively well contained Japan much smaller number need ask incoming tourists/athletes vaccinated.  Dr sounds like moron Reddit, last 6 years spent awful fucking website, OBSESSED shutting anti-vaxxers ragging corporate leaders getting preferential treatment. now, talking important vaccine long time deciding baseless skepticism vaccines good thing? rich executive get incredibly valuable medical stuff anyone else? Burn site fucking ground. That's stupid ass argument given millions upon millions infected now. 

No, vaccinating 5 999 999 people instead 6 000 000 make difference point. me. people dealt lockdown alcoholism, right I’ve eaten way 20lb gain feel like garbage im worried myself. Covid doesn’t get heart disease will. Honestly, real champion Australia, like China, brought major outbreak zero. One thing China Australia one else extremely strict sanitary cordons internally. really seems secret ingredient, though think people uncomfortable pointing out. see lots 'We locked HARDER LONGER' nobody says 'we sealed northern italy/the NYC metro.' 

Europe pretty much everything people complain US response wanted US do, really looks like counted nothing. okay people using argument waiting got shot. need convincing. taking story. would better story taking vaccine attempt stupid counter effective pr move. It’s odd receiving vaccine right away.

You guys really believe wants “good guy”? Give break...

You ALWAYS stand product. receiving vaccine shows confident product. It’s 1 dosage!!! producing millions doses weekly!!!

Some people eat anything smh care Smart enough invent vaccine, also smart enough let less important people try first. Seems like he's got brains counts. strategy wait vaccines though What? No. didn’t make it. That’s like chef walking crowded dining room saying “I know guys hungry, boss says can’t feed eats first.” Imagine would happen Vaccine actually nad sodę effects rushed. Imagine Havoc target 100 Million Vaccinated 100 days (from Biden's swearing in)

So April might actually turn around point time. think much reason people trusting helps (not individuel droplet reduction level om societal level). 

Firstly, barely large studies that's shows helps societal level, means FHM want recommend (if recommendations starts based ""guesses"" people stop listening).

Secondly, think People look much neighboruing country Denmark people wear restaurants standing example. People wear sometimes soon remove remove it. I've also seen Danes coming Öresund Bridge removing soon enter Sweden. think Swedes sceptic gullible idiots like lmfao I’m sure calculating based two things:

1) amount people getting vaccinated exponentially 

2) amount people getting COVID-19 exponentially 

We get herd immunity one way other. It’s conspiracy theory well-defined plausible incentives behind something happening. No, forever. take months reaching herd immunity (via combination vaccination people catching it) Covid becomes rare disease. stop wearing masks (although would nice people continue weather), visit friends family, maybe huge events would still discouraged. another months ok pool parties Wuhan August. cases peaked Feb, local transmission mid-May, huge parties August. Assuming requirement 2 vaccine single dose strong separate it.

No expert, I'm sure case. think much complicated but, put simply, second dose produces much stronger immune response first dose. one yet that's case. **ONE** department hospitals full (the ICU.)

If nurse denying care someone simply person ICU, nurse go prison homicide. Period. It’s conspiracy well-defined plausible incentives something. ""That means scared vaccines"" think news fantastic ""success"" Sweden earlier news disaster Sweden probably exaggerated editorialized make political point. 
It amazes Sweden's left wing pandemic response (tons govt spending large social safety nets actually enable people avoiding eachother) somehow model right wing thinkers abroad. could pick non-lockdown part simultaneously pay business close voluntarily assisting financially do, pay people stay home unlimited state paid sick days on. Unbelievable. Well since economy fucked up, Erdogan cant pay people stay home long times, work weekdays stay home holiday work. Social distancing likely mandated fashion another later spring, least places already norm. like going like light switch getting flipped Proving everyone definitely take opposed couple whackos saying think world difference.  Thank you. People politicising much. Sweden stand much look rest Europe. People actually done social distancing here, effective measure. course far success, people fixated Sweden keep leaving information. example look Finland fight virus, *as* different people make be. different, extremely different. vaccine really dangerous, would CEO come say anything getting vaccine? guys fucking retarded think lose lose situation. someone else pointed take vaccine live say prove safe done getting caught coming bullshit excuse. it. officially race innoculatuon vs infection.

Never. Had. To. Be. This. Way. 

Americans, one you, hate sincerely fully reason ICU cases plateauing? That's quite grim, find this? It’s obvious. vaccine distributed worldwide, global optics need considered, local optics. perceived altruism taking vaccine versus taking vaccine different depending talk to. players game (in competing vaccine manufacturing companies) always compared well. Christian born-again dad said didn’t want sheep asked wouldn’t wear mask. pointed Jesus’ followers called sheep Bible asked wouldn’t part protected flock. rolled eyes left room. ""people urged remain indoors much possible."" anything like US, ignored Stop rational reasonable! internet! Lol. wasn’t starting scratch though. Chris Cuomo put well tv tonight: “science builds upon itself”. They’ve working coronavirus vaccine number years SARS MERS. adapted years worth previous, lower priority less funded work target specific coronavirus. well coping large majority upset can't eat restaurant get drunk bar..sad times living through, stay strong.  great thing vaccine allow us get R value one. course that's lot easier restrictions still place. 
Depending whether possible vaccinate enough people long takes, things go back normal. Way list like ex president US, know elbow way front line. Exactly. Hence, deciding gets vaccine first,you find way get ""vaccinate people would risky spread it"" also making giving vaccination first seem like reward people work public health issues. 

From that, obvious things: people job declare essential workers gets go front line. Healthcare professionals obvious first priority, essential workers go: Factory workers get it, cashiers retail workers get it, etc. etc. (Heck, I'd go force business's owners pay employees' vaccines, well giving employees five days guaranteed paid vacation: two days shot, day side effects come play, one day reward service.) agree. Optics important.

We vaccinate upper class first Ya whatever wrobg words used. Still fast 100% effective worth getting yet surprised...... yet like disorganized crime, case mom.  4 days? help? German regulator could approve instead. Found one fast tracking vaccine rushed? Fast tracking means giving review priority drugs vaccines important. mean vaccine rushed; went clinical trials every approved drug vaccine. Hopeless trapped words hear most. Followed either inappropriate joke tears one really knows cope all. I’ve spending lot time talking former coworkers. home health COVID stressors aren’t particularly intense. understand appreciate they’re telling me, since I’m out, I’m burned traumatized hear it. think it’s helpful vent I’m starting dread getting calls makes feel guilty picking travel assignments. literally said he’s also 59 relatively good health, it’s entirely appropriate receive vaccine people need more. vaccinated camera, said might help increase public’s willingness receive it, citing Pfizer’s internal research. emphasized “none executives board members cut line.” Herd immunity single value reached over. superspreader events like concerts bigger number population vaccinated. Test others wait year retail store, really. said he’s also 59 relatively good health, it’s entirely appropriate receive vaccine people need more. vaccinated camera, said might help increase public’s willingness receive it, citing Pfizer’s internal research. emphasized “none executives board members cut line.” religion Normal life won’t ever happen..a new virus permanently introduced humanity..it’s going anywhere..
I also covid nothing (in case)..6 days “beginning flu like symptoms”, that’s it, fever, barely coughin, nothing really..it easier flu far (for me) getting data? Yikes. these. rude. I'm taking vaccine first months. see big deal wait. guess could rush take leave one less people need want believe WHO, 700 million people infected now. 'Tis season giving! /s much longer think mask mandates? Reminds SouthPark episode 'Gluten free ebola'. ""Then eat it!""  Bullshit, shit fucked knows it, he’ll one family put crap bodys likely vaccinated already, publicity.  He's also far removed development it.

BioNTech developed it, like Uğur Şahin making statement.

This guy mainly responsible logistics, financing, manufacturing, etc. "" Well, uh, stop sending money then?""

As opposed what, hoping government care them? Fat chance that. I'm screwed them, know need money badly (one health issues ayuda never came) circumstance pandemic, I'd rather people self-sufficient. could probably turn blind eye let fend personally feels morally wrong despite annoyance corrupt everything there. I'm pretty well here, moral responsibility care especially less well place? health care workers elderly vaccinated 2021, expect death rate decrease right? would say it’s far likely isn’t 100% confident product. wrong??? effective would got one. would unfair? whole point locking last spring prevent hospitals overwhelmed. vaccinate risk folks, front line workers, risk gone. 

At point, still worried, maybe order curb side pick up, ask friend go shopping you. majority population would rather resume normal activity threat collapse healthcare system passed. numbers reported it’s probably around 100 million+ now. 1 crore = 10 million. 
10 crore = 100 million knowingly wasted time?

It's wasted nothing better entertained you- unbelievably entertaining much reading

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sure, way state government mandate it. expect plenty employers will, though. I'm curious whether businesses able refuse service non-vaccinated customers.  happened mom. lives MS caught Covid.  Mom dad never go anniversary went restaurant. started trouble breathing several days later dad took hospital. able get spending 6-8 hours ER told (several times) space. eventually found room helped get bit better discharging (stayed 3 nights improving). Mom went back day later issue beds. Sent home oxygen machine spending day ER. offered transfer county hospital dad refused. Took 2 weeks (and lot luck) mostly recovered. 

My mom 73 yrs old. dodged huge bullet.

Here something ordinary, dad 78 diabetes know infected swab'd him. Said sniffles bit weaker usual issues. 

Crazy. high priority, imagine Elon Musk refusing drive Tesla car, would trust product ? slowly cracking sub ever since September It’s going fun figuring late effects millions people... mean, vents use, there's enough staff, patient critical poor prognosis, etc hospital disaster triaging. Turning away ambulances beginning. crisis plans exactly scenario, plans indeed include letting certain patients die enough resources go around. Yes Enough FDA bootlicking. Science great. Bureaucracy not. 

One simple change (looking data *at time* company, instead safety testing one other) would beat holiday surge impact safety.

But would mean little extra effort. medical community apparently that. So, yall think safe plan regular wedding (aka big ass party) next October? Think measles.

Assuming live high vaxx area, there’s probably still odd case area.  hits family two, stops. handful families you’re unlucky.

Without herd immunity get large unending outbreaks (like NYC one hit Jewish population pretty hard last year.)

Assuming you’re vaccinated measles, would good idea go hang people know infected? No, vaccine isn’t 100% fool-proof protection, especially large/continued exposure.  You’d pushing luck.

So may short (few month) period we’ve technically got herd immunity, (everyone) still careful still LOT cases there.  

After months herd immunity, case rates plummet becomes safe assume people aren’t infected.  There’d still odd case (like measles), zero risk. would much safer. What? realise Uğur Şahin. hypothetical, even mandatory things like ""vaccination mandatory school attendance"", see people anti-vaxxers willing pull kids school homeschool vaccinate them.

It's likely nothing short outright ""It officially law, either must get vaccine go jail- go jail, give vaccine strap table give force."" half hospital workers reluctant take vaccine. took it, would interested take vaccine thus saving life. Stop bullshit one dose millions nothing. safe thank 🙏 maybe people stand government welding doors shut? They're going convinced anyway. They're going make sure least extra hundred thousand people die control. Germans desperate.Just months ago country hailed example handling Covid-19 clue do.There reason USA European countries banking hopes vaccine - strategy. understand. again, US seems land extremes. Especially regarding political situation. either Rep Dem, like nuance. black vs. white grays. Covid situation. say media plays part igniting situation even well, reason read watch lot say.

In Europe watching US amazement. important stay open minded nuanced times like these, trouble afoot. seems like everything set spark conflict sorts, losers case.

I wish guys US lot wisdom. Random question, maybe, but: Turkmenistan still claiming zero cases? didn’t trust recommended wearing masks. fun standing outside then. owed nothing PR posturing. He's billionaire. He's side. issue people waiting short sensible - it’s people say they’ll wait months years clearly intention changing lifestyles, time spreading “concerns” clearly based antivax rhetoric.

Just makes feel like they’re looking middle-ground sake middle-ground, decades climate change smoking almost damaging nothing. US even held responsible toppling Iran Iraq mucking oil. link health Canada information trust vaccines undergone long term trial studies. fucking insane best Identify political there. Bad bot  Thanks! highly doubt knowledge damn ceo... Pfizer claiming make money vaccine. good look.

Vaccines limited availability, opinion matter all. Refusing vaccine means someone else chance it.

Wake up. Umm... 2008 Banks stole everyone's money. Nothing happened

2004 invaded country ""WMDs"". Nothing happened

Accountability? Joke Oh yes, tax bracket horribly risk We've spent entire pandemic watching ""important"" people cut line tests, treatment, special priveleges everyone else locked down, everything. suddenly CEO Pfizer want cut line goodness heart?

Yeah, that's load shit.

He first line get vaccine company developed camera inspire confidence it. People already skeptical this, whether ulterior motives not, definitely makes look like trust vaccine. ""Товари**щ**""

Am correctly? comment history really good sign mentally incapable logic reason. Oh agree vaccine helpful. even added footnote encouraging risk get one. human animal transmission related regards immunity mutation. vaccines diseases anti vax community slowly starting make irrelevant reviving nearly extinct virus like measles, mumps, polio. vaccines strains.

I'm saying shouldn't. I'm reasonable possibility pandemic beginning year fight get control. People would say vaccine saline water getting live PR move. vaccine wont change anything handled, rush it? American public covid, I've left extremes. said true. I'm fucking sick arrogance morons displaying keeping responsibility another's hands safe Canada it’s recommended child two wear mask. he's willing lie safety, would honest taking it?

There plausible deniability actual lie. Statements safety vaccine almost certainly *technically* true, minimum. CEO pharmaceutical company suddenly becoming altruistic $50(?) vaccine hard pill swallow. get PR department likely wanted use opportunity good publicity, good look. hospital let us know patient portal would contacting people individually vaccinations starting 2021, pretty excited! lupus self isolating since last January. holidays soo hard, especially seeing many people wont holidays 😭 plus game numbers. cycle air several times hour, also HEPA filter expose UV too, etc, etc..

I know UV leds create ozone? It’s really odd. hadn’t considered would reflect insecurity coming comment section. doesn’t get although turn (and he’s recommended otherwise doctor) country’s vaccination program, it’s odd. Yeah, exec team (actually whole company) get vaccine first. important people part vaccine logistics.

Pzifer deliver 2.9 millions doses one shipment.

Taking 10,000 doses (or even 100,000l fucking employees important part vaccine logistics fucking reasonable. I’m glad parents OK, must’ve pretty scary. Well, lot topics lying. Headlines like ""Sweden backs away strategy, this."" they've changed nothing. unnecessary Sweden bashing forum. Meh, honestly elite citizens go there. point point regardless whether agree not. 

If don’t think refute point views instead attacking comment history? Yeah non ops, ams, wear mask properly, ignore safety one way rules, talk face within 2 feet pulling makes down. Induct, rebin never sanitized sanitation wipes available stations either. FDA loyal anyone else aside safety American people. Read Jungle want learn more. lead long-term decrease cases current level, might easily stop spike therefore reduce values feed future increase virus levels. Lowering amount cycli opposite said lol. said, lower it, increased find weak positives. Weak positives re-tested assume get counted immediately Uh, relevant she’s *female*’governor? She’s governor. stupid one, yes, plenty men stupid governors “Don’t worry guys, sped long term effects trials put fast track cut thru red tape!” bottom line this, unless truly incapable taking vaccine covid, taking one. die, really simple

That sounds bit extreme, think? would one die? 

It always choice without compromises imho. People vaxxed endangered people chose (if vaccine effective). People chose also accept risk might get covid.

The advantage however, load hospitals goes people vaccinated. Overloaded hospitals allegedly biggest issue virus (at least what's constantly reiterated). see relief vaccine. ICU cases dropping, people would likely required ICU dying considering much virus spreading Sweden. Recovery takes weeks people ICU COVID-19 started spread quickly late summer early fall beginning die freeing beds. 

If check cases deaths graphs, deaths following increase cases people virus Summer early Fall are, late November now, dying people recently getting admitted free ICUs. plateauing ICU cases possibly decreasing death rate increasing. It’s much bigger one doesn’t take it. I'm surprisingly concerned, long companies make requirement, will. believe antivax like going favorite football team's games? favorite restaurant? plane? can't think many antivax folks would favor antivax normal life mao getting information reddit comment retarded af.

Even retarded spreading misinformation reddit comments Honestly getting vaccine months

This never convincing get vaccine- proud ignorance. reason I've responded posts (besides entertainment value) people end misinformed obviously easy upset dumb bit

Based responses people pretty obvious dumbing anything up- Night 😘

Night baby- sleep well- sweet dreams. Ya absolutely way Americans pull public health campaign, bet 35% + even get vaccinated. Americas better days long behind her. 21st C going rough. It’d great show confidence, interesting won’t though. Hmmm bet rent cheaper, though. economic power beside little human rights actually let starve.

Here italy every lockdown brings us closer disaster Lol flu vaccines year hit miss half time don’t even work. What? Sure insane people. also reasonable people concerned CEO makes lame excuse taking vaccine.

They deliver vaccine millions people per month week something. take one give CEO? Give break.  Inb4 2020 claims another celebrity's life. Work Amazon confirm still true. 2 minute. Work rat brain understand Lmao suuuuuure  people did. mean probably minority ruin everyone. He’s 59 years old well within at-risk groups developing serious symptoms (what vaccine designed significantly reduce). know he’s high risk job? company developing vaccine fights virus. could one two people removed trialling vaccine (all virus). Never mind bad publicity taking product you’ve designed manufactured... Almost like it’s gone *viral* something someone worked long-term care almost 30 years, staff nursing homes barely qualified anything. 

Due shit wages utterly horrifying working conditions, good, caring staff members jump ship, they're left dregs humanity feed, bathe throw pills extremely vulnerable population. places bad. Really, really bad. Where’s long term effects study particular vaccine? none. Clearly know enough know vaccine developed 9 months resources regular vaccines get. I'm planning staying home month getting vaccinated everything less kosher. Can't tell there's anything wrong that. Even accept Australia New Zealand basically moon regards able infected, explain Victoria's recovery significantly worse second wave? 700 new cases day one point (the UK point March) rather letting numbers explode like rest world point pulled back point single case community transmission nearly 50 days. internal border closures lifted Australians encouraged holiday within Australia Christmas.

All successful nations thing nothing lockdowns, masks, contract tracing border closures. governments acted decisively competently plan works importantly kept confidence people followed rules work out. appear two explanations this:

1 - Treatment better, people hospitalised shorter time fewer need go ICU. extent effect unknown. 

2 - ICUs full large parts Sweden. [Stockholms ICU expanded ICU capacity nearly much fall spring. 

When ICU full get plateau. Nobody gets somebody gets out. appear two explanations this:

1 - Treatment better, people hospitalised shorter time fewer need go ICU. extent effect unknown. 

2 - ICUs full large parts Sweden. [Stockholms ICU expanded ICU capacity nearly much fall spring. 

When ICU full get plateau. Nobody gets somebody gets out. pressuring EU authorities speed approval coronavirus vaccine battles surge infections Britain US begin mass inoculations, reports said Angela Merkel’s office Germany’s health ministry want European Medicines Agency (EMA) bring forward approval date Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine December 23 December 29, German newspaper Bild said, citing unnamed delay approval raising questions “the European Union’s ability act”, Bild quoted source irritation acute BioNTech German firm country preparing go partial lockdown Wednesday, non-essential shops schools close. Lying would worse happens catch Covid, would either come lied taking make people lose faith successfulness vaccine either case. Oh mean, CEO dead, would distribution company delivering vaccine all? doesnt sound likely. company would hit major disruption CEO suddenly passes away.

CEO using product exactly express confidence public.

This important confidence vaccine well setups EU countries. 

That countries emergency use authorization ""have"" vaccine inventors pathetic cases go far claiming credit sad, unavoidable. artifact things right. No, smaller proportion people hospitalized put respirator better treatment methods now. true second wave, long ICUs started getting strained.

Mortality among hospitalized gone well, places. Good news still state governors. say local culture good thing. _there_, framework people base decisions on. try go local's expectations much, get civil unrest riots. debatable, aim hate stating things plainly.

In Romania lockdown March 15 May 15 (approximatively). needed declare valid reasonable purpose getting house, like buying food, getting medicine etc. Guess what, beginning May people _really_ chafing rules, already seeing small-time unrest throughout country, people getting aggressive policemen, policemen giving checking purpose (out fear), small riots less savory communities. lockdown continued another month, debatable motherfucking army would needed keep peace.

Also, consider state government cannot good citizen's will. refuse accept certain decisions, point let chips fall may. do, bring army streets, stop people forbidden things? Shoot citizens? point, violence needed enforce rules gets bad things rules supposed prevent. cultural expectation never let state get _that_ aggressive citizens, pushback would quite bloody.

COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities 27 cell populations relative healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, inflammatory components elevated COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression genes neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, ICOS-ICOSL pathways COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed prominent role neutrophil activation, high abundance CD177, specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 highly differentially-expressed gene contributing clustering severe patients abundance correlated CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels higher COVID-19 patients French confirmatory Swiss cohort (n = 203) HDs (P&lt; 0.01) ICU non-ICU patients (P&lt; 0.001), correlating time symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels serum CD177 discriminate patients worst prognosis, leading death, recovered (P = 0.01). results highlight neutrophil activation hallmark severe disease CD177 assessment reliable prognostic marker routine care.   It’s people don’t trust science. still believe science also acknowledge scientists human make mistakes.

No, I'm sick hearing ""they stop transmission"" definitive statement increases ""well care"" mindset clearly flies face know vaccine interacts virus.  anything love!! don’t know you’ve noticed living pandemic every hospital (so I’ve told) unprecedented levels patients that’s need shut again. time dancing that’s case. drive ferrari owner company drove benz? How's difficult get?

If tens thousands already driving ferraris nothing bad report.. yes course? account 66% deaths state, death numbers significantly go folks vaccinated (which believe important metric) Maybe slight shred optimism. kind feeling absolutely targeted medical workers trying brighten days. Ffs don’t go volunteer hospital if

That said, go look yourself, want give wrong information. find link: make mind. Lots people gotten already seem died I'm willing get actually might able severe allergies, I'm waiting see vaccines show market. still get one vaccination, vs many people see statement say ""fuck that, even CEO wont get it."" produced fast people think. first mrna vaccine ever made B even first COVID vaccine ever made.

This truly sub-zero take. clutching bit there. one statement vaccine definite. cant QUITE TIME passed. lots people taking 'the certain parts' suit refuting ones dont. work ways doesnt it? Certainly, there's bureaucratic red tape cut observing adverse effects 1, 2, 3 years out. would take hours achieve that? think found problem assume everyone runs level competency. Fortunately humanity large us capable. Disagree. There’s reason give healthcare workers vaccine first, people developing vaccine take priority similar reasons. logic adult putting mask first airplane helping kid- it’s better everyone people fighting thing protected first.

Some random citizen isn’t going create another vaccine thing mutates, company might. specify modern vaccines. recall correctly polio problems occured 1950's reason use live-attenuated polio vaccines anymore. live-attenuated Covid vaccine candidates risky.  would anything love, done that. *desire That’s husband dealing job. EMS. 17% said would get week. said “never” said want “wait see happens. “. Covid think “good”. It’s disheartening. said talking departments it’s consensus. small % agree take it. course. you’re billionaire, much live for. Also gives opportunity test million people takes plunge suppose. Well afford fun norcal anyone would prefer think Pfizer linked can't guarantee Q2 delivery, may wrong reports true literally every hospital America fire overwhelmed patients yet find time make elaborate choreographed tiktok looks like took hours work on? Yeah doubts. /s gonna say exact thing!! Public health measures punishment. funding everyone work related mayor's salary, also he's working whole time well.
It would publicity stunt. Nothing science certain, that's way scientists theorise call things Theories X. 

That said, COVID19 vaccines advantage global priority support. usual bureaucracy slowing approvals, delays gaining project funding, lack suitable scientists conduct research, lack facilities resources, especially lack volunteers clinical trials last bit often takes YEARS organise. 

As analogy instead one librarian try find book library size city, entire city worth trained librarians working library find book. lot faster yet conducted people trained job correctly. cheek EU suggest UK rushed approval process well

You either accuse party rushing admit side slow it. options many people instinctively choose option puts blame someone else.

While know lost fight.. pfizer develop it, biontech did. Pfizer production though that's true. No, actually left yet. Despite Tumpets want believe, international dealings things take time. formal date leaving would July 6th 2021. time, expect President Biden withdrawn notification intent leave WHO.  Exact, bring issue unless wants create one?

 Let anti vax people know hes side 

Or create division like mask anti masks, never mind deaths damage precious Econmy banning cities counted mask mandates. many would lived mask mandate? many would suffering long covid? 

How many waiting, loosing ground illnesses injuries awaiting treatment overwhelmed ics worn staff? shipped hundred miles another hopital hoping get time?  mean cause said mean true.

That ""it it"" definitive statement. means fully tested that. None vaccines have. well, time come heavy artillery then. get masks self-protection. n95/99, ffp2/3, kn94/95. makeshift surgical masks meant protect others wearer's nasty stuff. masks meant protect wearer. also like ten rotate recently used one sitting paper bag ten days straight untouched. use disinfectant alot, donning mask, doffing mask, doffing mask. invisible ink everywhere, want ink hands, clothes, mask, face, inside home. social distanceing, stay home whenever possible. goes out. academic source this? curious.

You make excuses everything. Unfortunately Sweden, small differences brought different results. much people love compare Sweden neighbor countries, almost one mentions exactly countries differently. always boiled Sweden lockdown neighbors did, lockdown that's needed ward COVID. Same, it’s freshman year Consider shocked 100k deaths old folks homes. 

I wonder many could avoided Como Gretchen made people quarantine inside old folks homes.  erectile disfunction damage boys. can't help smile think neighbor never wears mask. right thing do, stuff like posted conspiracy capitol world people see wrong way. Oh do, got last magic beans sale u interested let know. No. vaccine relies spike protein. would mutate crazily vaccine ineffective.

The health ministry said there’s absolutely evidence variant resistant vaccine.

It’s similar variants found world. new variant coronavirus nothing new all, reason media seems really focusing this. It’s really *that* big deal first one produced, epidemiologists virologists researching laying groundwork/infrastructure years. fact this, biontech team behind pfizer's vaccine finished ""recipe"" one day. really think 44% going see people get week month go, okay, think safe now. already enough information know there's horrible short term side effects that's going cause immediate problems let know safe. people exactly waiting on? longer term effects, might well answer here. encouraging thing true asymptomatic people spread virus less pre-symptomatic people, vaccine greatly increases chance someone asymptomatic, cut transmission, even completely protect someone infection.

This make sense though. majority people asymptomatic according almost every news article yet huge amounts people still getting infected every day Ghosts blood? Ran essential oils? better call Dr.Doug!  000-472-482-NASA-389\*

\*national anti-vax science association go away ? What's going new strain? vaccines going ineffective it? going need social distance mask another year?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right? Everyone seems think vaccine going 100% cure-all..I'm little pessimistic. long ways go see vaccine even 100% effective (especially virus seems mutating like seasonal flu) long-term side effects.  Actually wrong. AZ swabbed UK trial volunteers consistently. 

More comments turns western vaccine candidate we’ve seen data testing asymptomatic cases. Usually catch cold. year. know it’s fine warm prior injections following specific procedure tested trials. don’t know stored say -50 degrees c instead -70, would affect efficacy vaccine.

It’s know would cause go bad, it’s tested know outcome. knew -70 would work 100% keep stable, chose route knew would quickest get trials. could chosen higher temp would added risk issue caused restart one phases, team decided eliminate risks go known good.

In likelihood somewhat warmer temp, need re-run part clinical trials get process approved. It’s hard believe two weeks ago Trudeau telling Canadians we’d likely behind Germany. Today, we’re day 2 vaccination campaign Germans least week away. Given German vaccine, that’s pretty stunning. That's fine. I'll take 62% vaccine right now. Yeah work cancelled today COVID 19, second time week. moved cross country September much chance discover new city. never sort shutdown/lockdown present. like 6 times flu 

on average. little kids young people rarely effected. covid really screws older people also awesome username. dig it. Unfortunately, never use term last line defense anything close it. Even accurate term, hard-core republican politicians, especially media, make seem though he's belittling, demeaning ""Frontline workers"".

Also, term last line defense makes seem though they've lost control situation. appearance control, even dont control, absolute important thing politician businessman. trump denial since heard covid around December. 

Our societal goalies literally standing us even worse pandemic outbreak. passes politicians verbally praise every chance get, actions belittle demean completely. 

Its like politicians ""support"" military, verbal praise wazoo, however soldiers given equipment thats Vietnam even older. standard living Frontline fairly atrocious beginning. least 75% military budget actually go military, goes contractors companies make experimental equipment never sees light day mass production cost effective.  Rules don’t mean anything without consequences. 5 lucky people vaccinated? nasty also drunk lol Pfizer Sputnik available unlimited quantities right now? not, government blocking receiving Oxford vaccine? want right 62% good enough me. Agreed! need least 70% population get vaccinated order herd immunity. That’s tall order country ridiculously divided  would one go trying volunteer pregnancy clinical trials? US secured 200 million doses (so 100 million people) Moderna believe half coming Q1 2021 half coming Q2, July. that’s vaccine potentially approved. think important months line. Theres reason push celebrities wealthy people front line reach point theres enough front line/essential workers older people willing take it. We're far right now. Travel Thanksgiving, morgue time Christmas.

Just like doctors scientists warning. Every disaster film begins people ignoring scientists looks like reality different. COVID given basement dwelling shut-ins sense purpose superiority enjoy leaving house interacting socially. end horizon, people realizing looked losers society like it. group also overrepresented Reddit. problem lots people refuse get vaccine find easily able blend people feel stop vaccinated, groups would wrong. stubborn refusal keep drama going longer. Better go arcade bar then! J&amp;J better track record. well, recently cut enrollment 60k 40k (they nearly complete) might indicate they're optimistic early data.

American agree message guy mischaracterized difference. US states mostly allowed deficit spend. means money coming in, cannot borrow cover difference (there ways, it’s limited cases).

While NL cannot print money, run deficit, unlike US states.

People confuse fact US Federal government run deficit controls money supply (sort of, since Federal Reserve pseudo independent, that’s different discussion)  sleepy year since 1993. got downvoted last time asking, vaccine revert effects covid? know stupid question, getting virus *twice* now, still feel like haven’t recovered. scares I’ve reading long term effects end worse. still plan wearing mask getting vaccinated, I’m beyond anxious afraid. vaccine fix mend issues virus caused? Moderna? Well there's nothing worry about. Ok no. Yeah. I've come look askance many people last months say, ""I'm anti-vax.... [proceeds offer anti-vax-lite view].""

Makes think science believability much spread spectrum believed. Yup. 1: Healthcare workers, 2: Risk groups, 3: Everyone else. Oh.. that’s #5, that’s extra timeline tack on.

Plus little bit vaccines actually take effect :/ definitely nursing home residents. anybody going get vaccines, get choose one would like get? Nice article, I'll sure read work, especially as, Western expert, appear built-in anti-China bias quite refreshing see even among scientists.

What answer avoid disease jumping bats humans, try stay well clear bat colonies? happens decide expand territories towards humans living? create sort DMZ keep us separated? Somewhere people cannot go bats also repelled from?

Thank you. depressingly reminds people died WWi morning armistice signed came effect 11 am. keep heads little bit longer. hell wouldn’t it? wasting money distributing vaccine higher efficacy average flu vaccine? It’s also produced much cheaper (non-profit duration pandemic always cost developing countries) easier move around doesn’t kept -70c. 

Your comment wasting resources factories makes sense. need choice vaccines, irrespective less 90% efficacy not. Hey fuck CNN. Let us enjoy glimmer spare us clickbait doom mean, haven’t really much way restrictions speak of. eventually enough people exposed, they’ll either get recover get die. point case count drop many already it. Obviously there’s lot deaths way though. stay home much possible. Hopefully employers get damn message sick people working aren’t going good. Hate tell you, economic damage done. I'm happy getting vaccine (somewhat) another year now, help lot people, thousands businesses millions people US alone lost means support. Economically, putting bandaid gaping wound. take many years come back this.  surprise one, really. Unless ignoring things make sense.  least 30%, sure, far know natural immunity closer 99%+ effective, least short term (which much know vaccines too). fill big gap. Also pretty likely naturally immune concentrate high contact jobs like service transit HC, effective slowing spread immunizing low-contact folks. started 2019, anyways. saw mention recently re-watching show double-take.

I thinking way 2019, felt longer-ago that. Nope. 2020 given weird sense time. can't reuse 62% vaccine facilities manufacture Moderna's stuff, use different technologies. could reduce US death rates 62%, would huuuuuuuge achievement own. inject veins right stop bullshitting.  likely line jab elderlies vaccinated.

I'm 66 issues, probably get jabbed early well. still mask out, still flu season, risk spreading anything. day covid restrictions went place here, clinic sick RSV, especially nasty respiratory virus. felt guilty, even though masked up. reason even mask supply covid I'd already bought flu season.  STICK It’s time anything permanent. go right ahead. absolutely hate won’t wearing one second longer necessary. don’t go I’m sick. sure it’s you’re they’re drive thru flu shots wearing full PPE. wondering people asking too. vaccine works making body make antibodies, can't think reason prevent spreading. Honestly? Itl peak Christmas/New Years. “It’s 2021, don’t need worry 2019 shit anymore” - everyone celebrates New Years house parties gathering Christmas claiming “see Im sick (yet)” here! That's question, time tell.

They many reasons fail test, many slip ups make people weary, i'm pretty confident things mostly go well ...still, large-scale test  different naivete? That’s awesome! Good passed 500million Pfizer. yes proving point costs. nickel dimed vaccines instead trying excess. US pretty big chunk money trying save money expense citizens. typo, meant carry virus. put dumb freedom. I’m in, big deal. I’d consider wearing future flu seasons honestly. It’s good thing they’re socially acceptable (even though sucks they’re 100% necessary still). I'm honestly leaning towards moderna. Pfizer need 2 shots effective? I'm really done research tho. Yeah, vaccine rushed hasn’t studied long term. It’s gonna go proven safe long term. Ah misread that. bad Jimmy doesn’t like get challenged people political side. Jimmy getting upset. time masks needed medical professionals due shortages Also, found virus spreads. That's reason change position: information.

Science set stone. Things change learn more. Everyone afraid okay take peoples' homes build freeway ""for public good"" okay take patent actually public good. upvoted lol noteworthy campaigning keep Marijuana illegal keeping 10s thousands locked nonviolent crime, causing gigantic epidemic addiction ensure profits, keeping drug prices high possible Americans can't afford them... Frankly, ~70% effective 90+% effective alternatives I'd hope FDA declines authorize US.   

It might sold third world countries cheap ... Sputnik V really 90% effective (same adenovirus type vaccine) Oxford/AZ abandon dog. data? think percentage whose much though. Someone quoting around 10-15mil antibodies virus. nearly high enough impact true herd immunity didn’t mention children...? company owns rights produce 62% vaccine doesn’t also rights produce 90% vaccine can’t drop vaccine start producing another one. would form sort deal partnership companies takes time. Also, hundreds millions doses 62% vaccine already ordered paid various countries fulfill orders first. Fingers crossed May, 30th birthday! Natural immunity probably somewhere like 20% already 30% spring. 2021 worse, numbers. gap wealthiest poorest Americans gets larger everyday. 

As long that's happening, conditions worsen United States. 

If food supply breaks down/is interrupted due catastrophic climate change event, see absolute madness.  No. ""Can vaccinated people still transmit virus?""

That never valid question. every vaccine ever had, answer always ""No"". fact people keep bringing valid question proof even anecdotal evidence absurd. personally would crawl 40% population get sooner. says don't? Oh yeah live Oregon now, lol. think people may underestimating expensive houses TX gotten, especially year. 

My point CA doesn’t exactly come first property tax. Actually, NY NJ probably fairer comparisons; they’re high. anything prop 13 CA needs revised taxes renting inherited houses like $1k/mo taxes. It’s destroying schools. Slaves make money guy. Aw, thought gonna ""Islands Stream"" websites tracking number vaccines administered country/state? would much rather see number count infection death numbers. Ok edgelord we’re done since seem actively trying misunderstand me. said they’re trustworthy Chinese dictatorship, pretty fucking low bar. PEOPLE SUB:

“How honorable Obama, Bush, Clinton, Fauci getting vaccine camera encourage Americans vaccine safe!”

“How honorable CEO Pfizer cutting line, saving single dose someone else first!”

🤣🤣🤣 weirdos happened Asia sars 2003 places. Super common people masks. insurance. jokes them, died there, got $5000.

Many sicker folks without insurance -- kind strain going create system have, forget individuals. cool really want go movies bars concerts live comedy shows depressing year Scheduled get first round Moderna Dec 22! moms calling someone claiming anyway :/ live nyc. vax keep wearing mask. psycho it. least inside subway think wear one forever. see get colds much. Thank you!

The scientific method process us gain understanding from.

Scientists error prone human beings.

Your comment beautiful!  I’ve seen joke retold many different scenarios still makes laugh. one especially got though lol  can't transmit I'm vaccinated far I'm concerned I'll nearly back normal get second injection. Lol happening Sorry guys, I’m taking vaccine EUA (emergency use authorization). We’re sure vaccine safe long term. short term effects ending pandemic, definitely worth it. Something keep mind scientists good jobs carefully study every possible reaction ingredient vaccine human body. pumping ""brand new ingredients"" body. Generally technology vaccination unchanged already ingredients injected previous vaccines. 20% US already infected. would imagine closer 25% April. vaccinate 45% population next 4 months going great summer. Hospitals getting overwhelmed right now. need flatten curve again.  see light end tunnel now. Hunker winter. 
 got this! Exactly, it’s good idea Humans survived changing climates infectious diseases many thousands years without scientific institutions. Science steadily making progress moving people away witchcraft folklore. Nothing happens overnight. Everything takes time.

We adapt. love wearing mask cleaning. Especially vacuuming raking sweeping. earth before?! remember things. saying walk softly carry big stick children That’ll me. Arizona too. ask us wear face coverings, nobody enforces it. I'm Moderna study confident got vaccine rather placebo. First shot symptoms, soreness. day second shot (which Saturday) fatigue, low grade fever. Sunday fever fatigue. Monday back work feeling fine. wish added ‘cheek’ statement. concern needle going ass real. Nobody saying that! could test more, end uo backlogs don’t enough capacity process tests. We’re past testing capacity able keep infections. provincial govt. sat money given federal govt. improve testing tracing. Consequently can’t process tests trace people back Spring, virus spread way, way back first wave.

This failure provincial govt. thought spread could controlled enough half-baked measures, would still able test trace properly. Unfortunately that’s viruses work we’re overrun. Good you. Bless heart. New president, new testing policy. math. 99% survival rate saying anyone's specfic risk 1% - 99% people get covid survive. 

To find actual risk death, would need calculate number people died similarities individual; factoring various health variables (age, weight, BMI, blood pressure, etc etc)

For example, someone 80+ much higher chance dying relative someone ~20 - seen disproportionate amount deaths skewing elderly.

This game Russian roulette. suck! follow example Jonas Salk! Pfizer CEO opting ""not jump line"" really add up. Yup 100%. They're embarrassed countries apparently handling COVID well (namely America Britain) already started vaccinating people aforementioned countries ordered vaccines summer. 

Brexit also playing part Britain specifically effect demonstrates advantage Brexit: UK able move quicker EU. sequences virus found market January shared Chinese researchers indicate pathogen found environment came sick people, animals, supporting theory may spilled humans elsewhere, report joint WHO-China mission February said investigations – including tracing back animals sold market – undertaken. China since said subsequent investigations yielded almost year asking ourselves, ‘does Covid-19 reservoir intermediary host?’. worked hard … haven’t found anything,” Chinese CDC director Gao said scientific panel last July, Wuhan Institute Virology researcher Shi Zhengli told Science Magazine part official team researchers collected samples farmed animals livestock Hubei province, Wuhan located, found positive tests virus.

So looked wild animals sold market haven’t found anything. Maybe it’s time look next logical pathway virus might come Wuhan.

The similar virus found Yunnan, 900 km away Wuhan. far know one instance virus Yunnan brought Wuhan: researchers WIV!

Why wont look obvious possibility? God caused COVID? Thank you, looked. Looks like they're full. said was? NY Times said rumors vaccine causing infertility completely unsubstantiated. Normalcy gonna resume soon people can. risk overwhelming hospitals goes away time Q1 Q2 2020, restrictions end. Experts recommend return normal 2022, they're gonna get ignored. one ever said that, ever. misunderstood that’s you.

This fluid situation start, vaccine changes everything. Agreed. Normal life happen till sometime post 2021. lot disappointed people next year. Yes, praviy sector azov battalions hundreds thousands displaced people eastern Ukraine went Russia prove admirable country is. Ukraine literally burn people alive trade union building westerners like praise it. better situation [eat dog lose lose him. Look comments. see people saying take he's dealing covid patients. also see people doubting since get company's vaccine. 

Reddit hate matter West Palm Beach. However, normalcy bias making complacent. neighbors say “Well...nobody know Covid...what’s fuss?” retirement community, mind you. - don’t know. don’t trust it. one bit. Sadly, 99% people never know result actions. 

That frustrating part whole ordeal- people empathy personally know. might wear mask around 90yo grandma, wear mask public (even though they're sneezing distance someone way see 90yo grandma). 

I wish way running counter- actions infected XX people killed YY people, counter hovers head like video game stat. maybe people would bit careful. tf days deaths man, it’s wild Especially China. allowed say drone targeting now? really need police sheriffs rule iron fist comply local state mandates restrictions. published yesterday. definitely view take something everyone consider. However, clear issues recommendations go beyond cherry picking specific statutes. Simply fact really data, makes sense doctors may think twice going type recommendation. Personally, want seek third opinion case. tens thousands people got vaccine months ago, without serious complications, good enough you? probably don’t associate anti-vaccine people dont run jnto often living rich bubble.

I thought common knowledge rich, educated people vaccinate less poor people:

[Parents vaccinate kids tend affluent, better educated, experts Different perspectives. see skepticism method eradicate complacency. Complacency patrolling complacency day day office- kills. Ignorance naivety forms complacency, passiveness creeps in, form intellectual laziness. 

This vaccine already proven cause severe side effects. Pregnant women instructed take it. &amp; data whether causes infertility. got joke still could give serious explanation words, took it. Lol smart play wait demand vaccine actually becomes limiting factor, make statement bigger impact. 

Right now, initial shipments even enough vaccinate top priority people want vaccine right away. wait they've actually vaccinated enough people convincing Grandpa Facebook Reader nurses think know better close becoming constraint number vaccinations. make statement take vaccine fresh minds. wanna play beer pong old fashioned way.

You’re also shit research it’s already posted, twice. narrative ‘I favor’, odd insinuation new information definitely conspiracy - shit, it’s well documented. Further, source covid related information comments section Reddit post, that’s significant problem. Ummm. sucks, wish better situation. 😢 combined fact [Sweden's frontline health care workers quitting worrying makes seem likely death toll depressingly probably going worse spring. November already [the deadliest November matter who's vaccine get, still get covid. that's reasoning.

 Life going back normal anytime soon. Even problem people think they'll invincible.  tbh hope masking forever. hygienic. Sorry lame attempt joke. “Muslin” kind cotton fabric. Yes, right limiting factor vaccinations ""people want it"" ""not enough vaccine"". come point many vaccines enough people take it, makes sense publicity stunt. Literally hear shit day...

Alright guys...help out.

I pro vaccine pro COVID vaccine. husband plan start trying baby soon I’ve gone 28 days vaccine. I’m almost 30, done waiting. teacher, fairly early get vaccine. I’ve done reading it, mental block “what if” causing kind infertility me.  Obviously don’t know long term effects, anyone know ingredients anything vaccine could potentially cause infertility? 

That’s literally cause hesitation. concerns itssafety efficacy otherwise, I’m sure wouldn’t pass vaccine could, but, I’ve got mental block, said. 6 months vaccine hope Sometimes history repeats itself. Sometimes, grabs lapel, smacks rolled newspaper yells ""Don't ever fucking learn?!?"" disagree, one would bat eye got Fucking BET Nobody could predicted corona virus would spread!!! He's 79, much way ""long term"" he's gotta worry tell difference perfectly right. Nice forecast, today 308089 deaths (ref anti-science morons criminally charged. question is: vaccine doesn’t reduce transmission limits symptomatic reaction have, matter gets it. 

Choose protect yourself, choose protect YOURSELF, aren’t protecting at-risk brother, aunt, grandma, friend, etc still pass virus Omg hilarious. He's trying wind everybody up, get conspiracy flames burning way high, Tomorrow show getting vaccine camera, suddenly flames doused ;) got attention everyone really wants preach to. Brilliant course meant derogatory— note phrasing: “essential *or* worker, implying doesn’t work. proove it? outdoors, obviously ventilation

There’s thing still air even outdoors. Plus wind could also blow virus towards face, masks still important even outdoors. thoughts pretty simple. I'm young, outside ""riskiest"" group. Even wanted get vaccine tomorrow, doubt could. 

I know long till available me. lets say month now. long significant sample people gotten vaccine (I assume hundreds thousands then) significant risk associated among getting vaccine, going get it.

I'm anti-vaccination person means. every vaccine had, thoroughly tested used years prior getting it. believe incredible amount political/economic pressure get vaccine developed release ASAP. time see reason trust Alex Jones/conspiracy ""media"" scientists actually developed tested vaccine. 

I'm sure statistically speaking million people get vaccine do, one person experience sort health complication post-vaccine. vaccine responsible? knows, sure bet old fat guy heart attack post COVID vaccine, someone gonna start blaming vaccine first.

As long multiple, credible horrific side affects getting vaccine, I'm board. would initial hoarding. But, continued fallout lied outweighs damage people hoarding. make decisions. Even bad decisions. choice have? Pandemic similar combat regard. perceive skepticism paralysis moments survival. Maybe I'm totally wrong big boogie man plotting us. doubt it. Nature give fuck virus hitting us full force speak. lIkElY StOrY  people front queue seen disease close. followed trials closely. know exactly vaccine alternative is. doubt. lining up, desperate.

I get laymen doubts. aren’t even offered vaccine. doubts, don’t care. don’t waste vaccine low-risk people make feel better something won’t offered six months. pointing something already know. That's responded difference two terms.

It different meaning, different word.

If believe look definition Latino o. ""In western states, cities adopted mask ordinances,""

A major cities adopted ordinances. Masking, source confirms, happening way lower levels now.  county supervisors spending energy trying recall governor Gavin Newsom unfriendly small business, sheriff (no local police OC cities) refuses enforce anything covid related. word lost meaning point. Anytime two people agree break law (and tell anyone) conspiracy. Technically park loading zone mom car that's conspiracy. covering ever cover infant's face. 

How work Northern 2/3 USA? genuinely fear infant fight muslin swaddle, flail arms thin piece muslin cover face. 

So, unattended? Like, see simply convinced face masks concern infants? Assuming, like things, give let die.

It's also concerned letting child climb playground might alone supervise. comes bit...disingenuous? Like, arguing argument's sake?  Seems sketch. made making us try see goes. Imagine one get adverse reaction. hope keep writing thoughts experience matters captivating writing style. Would scary find someone position Right 1 12 Iowans corona. I’m thinking people didn’t take serious getting it. sitting 95 100 customers wearing masks Verizon wireless store huge turn around mandate. Probably 60-70 range before. I’d rather hear promote confidence it.  GUY. ReAl!!1!1!! Healthcare worker, see patients person daily, one test since beginning got line like everyone else exposure. routine testing, part major health system. Source? Since 2010 NY state's population grown 100K people. year may changed things, doubt 4%. lot people left city, moved elsewhere state lot cases. really throws red flags. Even want change it. took them? correct leave compromised health care workers. mother works nursing homes. late 50's, risk. Even elderly willing die COVID rather loneliness, mother sign die. sister lives her. people either working homes exposed are. reason? trying find didn’t much luck Yes ? That's highly optimistic he's pretty cautious making predictive statements. 

Unless herd immunity comes primarily infections rather vaccination he's incredibly pessimistic. realize probably wouldn’t matter anyway people. Anti-vax community would say lying. 

They already real research safe, anecdotal marketing/PR stunt, anti vax community throws garbage believes whatever see propaganda meme accused knowing secret harmful vaccine conspiracy.

But harmful, PFE would fall faster oil tanker stratosphere. person single strongest personal interest happening CEO. secret knowledge harmful vaccine would never see light day. company makes billions year, would gain failed vaccine vaccine. There's ""you tried"" award capitalism. said, I'm going put blame UK again, EMA used located pack move continental Europe Brexit. considerable part staff willing move (which understandable), they've short staffed trying settle new location. Hardly ideal situation pandemic.

If case ought alluded rather cast doubt MHRA's approval process time faith vaccine safety all-time low. unconscionable circumstances global vaccine effort. comes another battle.

Idiots couple Google searches, fall false info Facebook social media suddenly deciding know vaccines MD/DOs, Nurses, PhDs fields etc.

I trust people endured years extra decade schooling training post bachelors opposed idiots HS diploma (which barely even got). people wouldn’t understand basic idea cell, let alone mRNA, virology, yet expect believe professionals? Honestly reworked Santa’s blood make vaccine. Probably much easier Lucky sharks left alone. girl's name Maria? treat anyone - difference is, unlike countless young people system leaves streets, bodies broken can't take it.

This society fucking sick. name that's holy someone medical field trust science? grand scheme things small, people politicians took seriously beginning, would gotten far widespread.
It amazes normal people rationalize inconvenience all. basically saying people worth much others. RGB keeps Covid-free anti vaxx? Really? Personally, don’t think there’s issue, grammatical gender isn’t concept actual gender anyway. Spanish speakers understand that. German speakers Hindi speakers many others understand that. Monolingual English speakers generally DON’T understand that, they’re ones see trying make Latinx thing could also report state’s Department Health. wingnuts think there’s microchips estrogen vaccine.

Most people fence uneasy fast came market, worry possible side effects. know execs don’t know works, feel way.

It’s normal human behavior mess complicated things like this, faking vaccination could tricky chain custody product like risks getting caught trying replace purified water whatever.

If show confidence it, would show people believes it’s safe. people think mastermind going fake vaccination trick us. Front line workers: vaccine becomes available facility, employer require get it? Science one definition. Yes methodology acquiring knowledge. also collective sum knowledge acquired using scientific method. pick one specific definition merely play grammar police someone else's comment... Wow.

Additionally given one definition science collective knowledge; original comment man made science stands sentence accurately conveys meaning. Likewise tons scientific inventions. 

If want grammar police; ought make sure right first. Otherwise sound like idiot. surprise fantastic news regardless.

200M Moderna doses + 100M Pfizer doses = 150M vaccinated Americans, great start, especially highly effective vaccines.

Here's hoping production logistics ramps successfully planned. causes drama around didn’t choose take early. could counterproductive actually give people less confidence Don’t remind would care? ICU beach chair. matter exactly someone needs bed. beds, thats shocking news, mostly covid. don’t know means much, thank know you’re appreciated many, even ungrateful bastards there. think need go full ""there poetry Auschwitz"" levels morose. things bad? Yes. things bad? Yes. things continue bad least time? Yes. said think important every day defeat. celebrate good news try retain hope. think important. Still, tried. observed safety procedures would clear. Point didnt behave like complete asshat.  Didn’t say Santa immune covid? RNA DNA different building blocks; thing mRNA get uptake protein built it.

I understand meant humor, mRNA platform going predominant delivery mechanism future vaccines temp controls solved. [tabular indeed created English speakers Yeah get vulnerable vaccinated essential workers see steep decline people interacting general population most. lot us staying bubbles hopefully see steep decrease. still think January going rough month. mRNA technology isn’t new, thing rushed bureaucratic. 

Normally vaccine development things take long time: funding, approval, recruiting, manufacturing. done higher speeds emergency approval government funding massive amount people willing sign trials. live here. Everything open. Bars, restaurants, stores etc. small business owners losing life's work. Everyone wears masks public besides live life prior.

Further know people (or friends friends) caught covid. one serious case. multiple friends work different hospitals er nurses they've said covid patients there, even close capacity. ITT bunch sneaky anti vax BS disguised thoughtful conversation.

This disinformation looks like, folks. dumb enough write blatant anti vax info. ""just asking questions"" thinking loud, planting watering seeds doubt.


It's campaign, let get you. public health awareness campaign vaccine it’s created/how works?Air news channels. end show Diane Sawyer, Obama, Bush Taylor Swift getting vaccines we’ve changed ton minds. Get god damn vaccine want hug friends! Saint Clamburger Helper Gaga dropped first dance album years played club 😓 Yeah, understand many us concerned skeptics going prolong this, declaring “doctors nurses must get else” may missing least 3 key variables.

I would imagine within 6 months, almost health care workers required get vaccine. Here’s makes sense wait 6 months instead now:

1 . vaccines start submitted full authorization months, said. Forcing someone take emergency authorization vaccine bad precedent. 

2. We’re supply constrained vaccines right now. don’t gain anything forcing issue today. 

3. We’re supply constrained health care workers right now. leverage. 6 months, less able say “you need me, I’m taking it”

4. certain group people refusing masks saying “if don’t refuse masks, they’ll make us take vaccines.” Getting many vaccinated possible headlines start reading “FORCED TAKE VACCINE” may infuriating, it’s we’re going win 

The critical point take away following strategy prolong pandemic, shortens it, despite decision individual health care worker makes.

It’s going okay. We’re going okay. It’s revisionist history many. Two personal friends got covid like 90% likely dining indoors (not together).... immediately said “but always wore mask!!!” 

😑 That’s minority. think would’ve worth speed process anti-vaxxers make point? Absolutely correct. supposed dermatology appointment march got cancelled (and feel safe rescheduling) working home shitty desk, shoulder developing sort repetitive strain injury feel safe going doctor it. also noted different healthcare systems different levels training. Province part RN education nurses get Bachelor's Degree Science. You’re absolutely right. don’t know you’re getting downvoted. There’s way long term effects vaccine worse actual virus people say there’s huge amount people say opposite, didn’t come nowhere Germany wants take European road act together EU countries. think show germany doesn’t want act bit cooperation rest. emergency use authorization.

That means risk vaccine outweighs risk getting Covid everyone except 16s.

That's thing required taking it.

If someone gives 1/100 chance death 1/50,000+ chance maimed choice clear.

Probabilities difficult people understand helping average person understand reason EUA. give someone 1/100 chance death, technically even alternative gives 1/101 chance death, still choose latter.

But human beings perceive taking action way omitting action. perceive *choosing nothing* safer means blameless. That's absolutely true way feel inside. one many incorrect perceptions world. “barely deadly virus” taken three family members two friends life’s. doesn’t directly affect can’t comprehend huh? One flight = eat meat year.
That rough estimation. think distancing requirements types workplaces large economic social impact. People get together friends outside work. No. winning move.

For know, already got COVID point got protection naturally, maybe got vaccine already early development, maybe knows he's allergic it, maybe got irrational fears about, ...

Sorry, - he's human like - fucking entitled demand anything like him. rights make decisions you. private. national leaders demanding get vaccinated. CEOs, manufacturers. nations run certifications trust building. Check. Yourself.

He said ""No comment"" whatever private. anything put position bowl, couple personal success vaccine's. guess that's implied anyway. LMAO, wants sure safe. ""Doesn't want cut line"" ya O.k. 😋 Europe complaining I'm going take counter stance.

Without rich countries pledging buy every vaccine sun, resources produce many vaccines. Especially many different ones different logistical requirements.

As long excess make way countries timely manner problem. able start sending next coronavirus season. end decaying warehouse somewhere, heads roll.

The reason even little faith happening Biden charge (for us least) Yeah Republicans generally tend hate Jesus stood for.  January seeing less doctors/nurses hospitals, rest probably unmeasurable. 

## Abstract

Among 3926 healthcare personnel (HCP) multisite healthcare system, minimal population prevalence COVID-19 4.4% (bootstrap 95% CI 3.7%;5.0%), infection fatality rate 0.6% (bootstrap 95% CI 0.0%;1.7%). Rates reflected local community prevalence hospital exposures specifically exposure COVID-19 units. Pharmacodynamics years? propose half life hours/days? Ah yes, I'm sure county council passed stimulus they're pocket Big Oil, Wall Street, etc. 

Like said before, Congress done jack shit that's problem. state county levels, restrictions come from, access trillions stimulus. They're jobs, enacting restrictions keep people alive. Congress needs job now. LMAO one brainwashed, know it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean would one dose change everything? people would trust guy owns vaccine takes themself. Never claimed trials fraudulent. They're obviously not. think sounds reasonable unprecedented vaccination effort global scale breakneck pace might corners cut along way. I'd like wait bit, get egregious immediate side effects way. enough people willing take risk me. course, whatever longterm complications might arise willing risk, fellow man. problemo. worry, I'll get vaccine I'm trying convince anybody get it. didn’t say deliberate, said “waiting see” implies could nondeliberate side effects trials missed. genuine curiosity: expand this? There's tons illnesses injuries get far worse without prompt treatment. Report CDC ""But took every precaution!"" /s Paywall. someone please post article? Buut common among drug manufacturers? Perhaps big manufacturer history comes drugs? mean idea guessing.

Also curious, personally gonna take vaccine? Mask wearing Taiwan went 50% autumn 95+% right government proclamation despite total lack COVID. think take much get 90% vaccine compliance here. Old news. Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody. [EUA granted November Weeks. Hah surprise many also sell essential oils diet shakes side. Moderna/Pfizer vaccine first (amplified) mRNA vaccine deployed. Messenger RNA sequence genes translated DNA turn translated protein, process one foundations life.

The vaccine mRNA, gets injected muscle, find way (white blood) cells, replicates part amplification mechanism RNA strands instruct cell translate particular sequence genes SARS-COV-2 antigens.

So, instead injecting antigens directly normal vaccine, extra antigen manufacturing step cells. Similar regular vaccine immunesystem trained react antigens, building immunity potential real COV-2 invaders.

The COV-2 vaccine safer traditional vaccines, synthethic. traditional vaccine inject weakened inactivated pathogens. really small chance traditional vaccines actual full disease occur that. COV-2 part COV-2 vaccine carries, however, antigen genes. means risk getting actual COVID-19 vaccine.

Also, COV-2 vaccine mRNA viral structural genes required infecting cells, infectious. turn viral disease own. infectious, white blood cells somehow unable get rid it, would shown first trials.

Conventional vector vaccines COV-2 also close deployed. make use different harmless virus carry COV-2 antigen genes. replicate body immunesystem reacts clears out, building immunity. still trust Moderna/Pfizer vaccine, could take risk wait months AstraZeneca/Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

Knowing this, Pfizer CEO must understand vaccine he's waiting studies long term effects.  Masks don’t anything stupid like 20 protestors. error. calculated decision ensure safety participants. looked closer data, complaints Europe. Please shut fuck you’re scared barely deadly virus stay home don’t drive entire world dystopian nightmare you’re irrational fears inability think read lies fucking dork  sure hope can. data really inaccessible anyone high school degree. can't understand it, sure hope actually patient interacting... she'll messing lot up! guarantee social distancing measures Netherlands many European countries utterly ineffectual time Spring comes. Yea, real answer. first surprised, almost Dr/Nurse/EMT friends said wondering going get vaccine not. actually clarified matter getting testing potential long-term effects rushed vaccine. It’s work wizard poison/government mind control chips, it’s “is adequately tested” sentiment definitely agree with. explained type vaccine, likelihood side-effects already low, impossible, testing processes usually many years, months.

Inpatient hydroxychloroquine use declined 80%, corticosteroids tocilizumab initiated two days earlier May *versus* March 2020. Two-thirds ventilated COVID-19 patients already receiving corticosteroids March-May, resembling pre-COVID use mechanically ventilated influenza patients. participated vaccine trial. one person based observations experience take. Pfizer vaccine trial whole thing isn’t run Pfizer. It’s run clinical research sites country. fact it’s decentralized way gives bit confidence massive side effect issue Pfizer tried bury lot people involved want believe would least one whistle blower would speak out. Save rest world, sheesh. We’re getting 85% available Moderna vaccines, vaccines country first 2 quarters. That's fair valid point. incorrect. Yep, fit right Klamath County.   Right dude. appears walk outside chance mauled bear. allowed tell there's proof mauled bear, prevent ability people successfully avoid bear attacks. get you? I'm going interject, partly believe u/Kurat responded thoroughly owes nothing further, partly believe arguing bad faith. ...no efforts made revitalize this...

u/Kurat's previous comment actioned spiked 810,000, pretty serious, right? Except **only 61,000 deaths** flu season

Also, asking redditor opine media coverage arguing bad faith. field hospitals constructed

Citation please. Burden proof accuser. 
That said, are. [cursory result [and [and acting bad faith. Jerk. must Olympic athlete good *jumping* conclusions No, even people virus still need take vaccine. immunity stronger, covid-19 mean catch again. Honestly, I'm going wait anyway, I'd rather 94% effective vaccine. end I'll take whatever available turn comes, I'm definitely going fly overseas may much less effective vaccine Jesus. Sorry. say mask compliance due mandate. Like said, can’t speak elsewhere, mask mandate doesn’t anything people don’t comply. mask mandate Iowa maybe 40% ppl wore public. Now, Iowa it’s 99% mask compliance. mask mandate doesn’t automatically make covid spread. People actually wear correctly, Iowa now. least mouths! 1 2 infection holes covered ain't bad compared here. . . shortage gullible people country. years even close anything semi normal trust masks arent going away anytime soon. safest thing would (and anyone vaccinated) keep masking reach herd immunity. I'm necessarily going force anyone vaccinated wear mask, think Fauci needs forcing. probably continue wear mask abundance caution Take you. fault born can't escape! One reason: encourage people gotten vaccinated continue wearing masks. would like direct attention 1997 anthrax vax rollout. even highlighted Evolution, silly dumb movie love. 

Just check military subs see people talking informed consent covid vax. series newspaper opinion pieces citation anything PR firms bluster. There's someone blame that. **Get it**. last thing want double whammy flu *and* Covid.

Also, recommended take vitimin supplements (specifically C) developed world.

Where else would care? Also “what’s point taking doesn’t”?! Singapore approving make feel better? Japanese Americans US don’t report issues? mean, obligated get tested, hate say it, think pretty sure is. Best luck. expect see lower health/life insurance rates. Kind like non smoker discounts I'll never understand rural people who, covid rate initially low due isolation, think covid going skip county forever. live county, new deaths reported almost daily now, still people walk around mask nose. Idk it’ll normal then, normal-ish. Like idk we’ll packing stadiums capacity concert tours. super large mass gatherings like last things come back. hope I’m wrong though. damage saying this. belief makes okay justify lack preventative measures. get you? people think virus hoax keep catching it? study compromised, continue collect data. Yeah cover nose mouth? Source? gotta friend who's terribly afraid that's what's going happen... 70million people voted trump dont wear masks probably sure shit dumbasses get vaxxed. getting one help makes sense. Im getting can. Life eont normal evenclose years. That’s awesome! Thanks recommendation! believe technical term ""Virus-like Particle"", VLP. vaccine taken proper care supply chain injected someone. Would ineffective? would person know? admitted INTENTIONALLY choosing black person receive first vaccine order politically virtue signal blacks?

Why would anybody trust people politicize ""medicine""? I'm waiting countries approve it. I'll happily fly UK get vaccine to, giving zero fucks FDA's opinion subject.  people ALWAYS risk matter what. Stay fuck home let 96 percent live lives normally. know trying make complicated saying. I'm taking sort stance. ""It appears still get infected COVID spread vaccination."" evidence this. That's I'm saying. indefinite. basically one fucking year. dying next year get it. 20s-40s, reasonably decades left life. limited year.  vaccines wearing fucking mask almost zero impact life asked wear probably one year. Good grief. 1. Nothing really official, stuff I've read Reddit articles saying many nurses doctors skeptical rushing get vaccine. Maybe would time? saying surprise many waited. 
2. Yeah, I'll probably calling one relatives. 
3. hope - I've disappointed instead smartest clearest thinking charge stuff like this, politicians playing Game Thrones control gets what. Japan needs wait time see fine use Japanese people, we've burnt vaccinations need test properly time. Oof. Knew year gonna blow spent midnight New Year’s hospital room boyfriend’s dad. 99% Covid known tested for. hallmark symptoms including drop oxygen loss taste/smell. said aspiration pneumonia. I’m SLP thought bull dx even then. fellas lucky, fellas aint Everyone happy see TikTok videos. I've spent like $10 total masks, feel like need get money's worth continuing wear necessary. Hospitalizations peaked Midwest November. Hospitalizations Gulf Coast states peaked summer. may 1 two hitting new highs. 

NJ NY hit highs back spring. Except gotten new information apart effective vaccines are...

They've always operated assumption vaccines reduce symptoms transmissability.

Also, saying spring herd immunity likely. yesterday!

The new news since Moderna's 95 percent efficacy. half dose issue US slowing it, well apparent lack transparency overseas data. FDA still strict data requirements; we'll waiting US trials reach certain number cases There's much PR gained taking destroying credibility anyone saying vaccine safe.
If takes it, anti-vaccine argument disregarded completely. Dude confident product, took himself. get this? Im pro vaccine find, stop short requiring people receive vaccine law.

There carrots sticks.

Give people businesses tax credits deductions getting vaccinated. Much better. you... god damn good.  [I second one start Season 1 battlepass. huge discussions, people following rules. sure many want throw away masks attacked multiple times.

Now vaccine, know yet truly work long term. months research field studies hundreds thousands people.

It would important get hospital, take shot throw away masks believe job longer need care.
That behavior equal Covid deniers people care others.

At moment throw away masks, stop social distancing pandemic believe safe now, moment become one attacked months.

We would need 65-75% world's population immune, threshold reached normal life won’t there.

It requires one person virus non vaccinated area thousands could die. also need keep mind virus even becomes less deadly due vaccine, still mutate become deadly enough hosts.

A doctor spoke said Virus reaches end ""life"" change significantly often Virus real threat.

The vaccine could threat far nobody knows impact have. scientist, flu virus changes lot well since vaccines. year somehow different, need new shot. could similar Covid produce new vaccine every year highly doubt due nature vaccine requiring cold storage people preconditions able take it, big difference flu shot almost everyone take local doctor.

Yes, social life degree back, similar last summer, could pretty much everything again, smaller scale mask equipped.

But assume throw away masks get stadiums 100k people, traveling everywhere around world illusion. Please let thing. find depressing point.  Americans likely social distancing wearing least next fall, according Dr [Anthony 

The first sentence article contradicts headline. seems Office Micheal calls Wendy's Ya that's point. ZERO clue there's long term effects any. research even make claims on. That's people scared of, especially African Americans due America's history health disparities committed minority communities. Knock week .... care. take it. chance unfortunately. much Santa's immunity. I've able wear contacts, wear safety glasses lot work lifesaver. meant applied inside diving mask stop fogging up, works regular glasses too. Could worth try? Thank pointing data, much appreciated understand one stance cause damage(pretend happen abandon preventative measures) stance right(mask)?  Seriously, side effects reported flu pneumonia vaccines. got yesterday, feel fine. That's good point kind seems ignore 5% U.S. population diagnosed case point. actual number infections would significantly even higher (and continues grow.) Assuming vast majority infections lead immunity, would think number people needing vaccine would good bit less he's stating. know that? hope that’s mean that! that’s case, wish would elaborate exactly mean “semblance”, don’t think I’m one thinks phrasing odd  idea. Cansino launched phase 3 November. efficacy data yet. 

They plan offer 1 dose average people, 2-dose people weaker immune systems. guess eventually conduct 2-shot trails like Johnson &amp; johnson. Bro, keep fighting. know internet comment could meaningless mean sincerity. Oh neat! Good know. estimates data late January makes sense. Although late February FDA application seems..late Yeah, always get flu vaccine always gives side effects day two. year gave killer muscle aches, fatigue, headache. Still better actual flu, wipes two weeks makes wanna die time I’ve it. talking two doses. Like two hundreds millions... translate assuming want go upper class statement? There's PR gained taking destroying credibility anyone saying vaccine safe. many doorknobs lick... you’re completely okay spreading can’t get it? Yeah sorry no. new here? It’s calmed bit recently due positive vaccine news, since March it’s mostly goal post moving oomers arguing strict end sight lockdowns. comment sway people away getting vaccine. person saying nurse getting religious reasons. case people work with. different reasons like gotten COVID already, feel like safety part handled, plain worried vaccine fast.

It example personally concerns taking it, especially first take developed rate never done before. course, believe vaccination. say getting it, right?

And know GBS extremely rare, worked specialized Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTACH) someone respiratory needs GBS would likely go. still mean think caring person cannot move muscle themselves, breathe own, line every possible orifice. disagree president authority issue lockdown mandates onto citizens. constitution grant president authority so. states. It’s really severity that’s downplayed. Never heard someone laid 48 hours flu shot. everyone, better know front case could get really sick, you’re poisoned (more expected.) Even orthodox top leaders recommend vaccines! can't believe indoctrinated people become Facebook etc that's nut-picking - lots people say lots things. mainstream articles top comments (or even highly voted comments) type claim. point think hospitals requiring vaccination since none getting enough staffs anyway, presumably nursing homes get kind consent (someone help right term) legal guardians residents vaccinate many possible. suppose nursing homes may mandate vaccine residents condition moving other's wont. moot there's vaccines available people willing take them.   Psychologically, NYC health care workers also benefited people holing houses city shut down.

It must devastating right people getting work hospital get see people giving damn commute home. don’t disagree part that, it’s still profit safety it’s option government given. It’s absurd option, forced lot people take unnecessary risk make sure profits aren’t interrupted. islands far fewer people US vaccines trials fail...

That problem -- planning program, plan bad cases. much vaccine costs money. enough vaccine, costs lives. 

A soldiers worst fear running bullets.  Bullets cheap. Soldiers not. reason don’t get flu vaccine. I’m low risk group, don’t feel need vaccine vs. risk virus. Depends country. Yes USA saved rather soon, sadly true worldwide care birth plans also disrupted positive test result. “Women expressing much fear infected, also going hospital, delivering separated child,” said Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, epidemiologist primary investigator HOPE COVID-19, new study focuses well-being women pregnant study launched July follow 200 women around world, pregnancy 18 months postpartum, understand Covid-19 pandemic response impacts pregnancy infant health Jelliffe-Pawlowski team analyzed data first group women, finding “absolutely incredible” levels stress anxiety. “Sixty percent women experiencing nervousness anxiety levels impede everyday functioning,” said, citing preliminary data. “There number women, particularly lower-income women, expressing hard choose stay job puts risk versus quitting job enough food 70 percent participants reported feeling worried decreasing family income 22 percent worried food insecurity (though none experienced time survey).

Either getting sick, dying, losing job, closing business, terrible mental health etc. I'm thinking mean? sideline everyone's grief struggles. worried all. actually overcame binge eating disorder pandemic. Social gatherings always trigger me. feel like lot times would well go visit family social gatherings would throw track. Social distancing helped lot. Yes, can't wait get back gym either. need community accountability keep exercising. Right I'm laying miserable back spasm caused sitting Zoom meetings fucking day long getting enough movement. Hate this. heart breaks. appreciate putting front. Thank you. Go home. You’re drunk. It’s perfect excuse get new cases down, spin saying it’s vaccinations. Clinical testing cover widespread long term studies. vaccines past shown caused adverse reactions rare cases already widespread use. E.g. oral polio vaccine caused polio 3 per million.

Public need told covid19 vaccines may long term adverse effects, gone long term testing. Science trusted evidence open, honest subject scrutiny. profit involved, well...draw conclusions. really not. ok. Pretty sure changed reporting times. usually reported daily cases morning changed 1pm believe. 

Ontario averaging around 1700-1800 cases past week so, spike probably due extra 3 hours reporting. Yes, that's tested different storage temps. Pfizer knew it'd stable -94F therefore bother trying test -- speed market thing. 

I would surprised ultra cold storage requirement dropped point next year conduct followup studies determine mRNA stability. Riiiiggggghhhttt That's awesome good you! Yeah, except that’s what’s happening. Instead, going seeing younger people hospital get vaccinated. people hospital, generally reason “a cough couple days”. question whether enough young people sick fill hospitals still drives restrictions number. People say aren’t going follow restrictions doesn’t really work businesses actually closed constrained way. certainly wearing mask make even worse.

One favorite coffee shops right next hospital that’s taking bulk COVID patients get admitted region, drive past time. looks quiet peaceful outside, aunt who’s nurse described differently.

I’ve signed Pfizer’s pediatric trial, hopefully it’ll approved soon bright side, I’m sure won’t miss listen drivel. “This totally safe it’s tested 40 year”. 

Ok examples?

“The two trying get take ceo won’t take”



Lol ok. think comment section extremely hypocritical. People criticising vaccine think might long term side effects (despite scientists medical professionals stating otherwise) saying refuse get available. Meanwhile, choosing stay exposed virus far dangerous confirmed long-term side effects patients. logic?

Some people reddit starting sound like crazy anti-vax moms made fun back... lot dreams like well. feel like insane friend group still getting together caring. Meanwhile, don’t go anywhere unless it’s work grocery store always mask much Santa’s natural immunity. point multiple reports substance current vaccine rumors ignored. think covid going significantly affect fertility, vaccine likely going to, know moment. Maybe so, put important info actual sms. felt like thing say thing. Let conspiracy theories begin definitely mentioned GA multiple grades. learned killed lot people penicillin ended it. 

Yep, that’s it. 

They don’t talk process actions taken get point. 

History classes also focus understanding actions PEOPLE, rather memorizing general facts like dates country origin. learn mistakes PEOPLE, memorizing names dates 

- reason behind actions? 
- solutions come effective were? 
- alternative actions could done prevent mistakes given technology knowledge available time period? Plague santa seems like twisted horror movie trope honest explosion cases thanksgiving, trend it. Wary: worried, concerned 

Weary: tired Wow, man made viruses sure mutate alarming rate. get saying argument, although simply CANNOT get board idea ""it really matter"". could vaccinate thousands tens thousands people 20 days, efficacy 52% one dose alone, lot lives potentially saved. Literally makes sense it. money J&amp;J, due confusion Oxford Loss smell/taste highly reliable symptom Covid. also associated milder course disease, see TLDR: people loss smell/taste generally recovered home, people needed hospitalized generally intact smell taste.

You notify contacts past couple weeks self-monitor symptoms take additional precautions, even test result come back negative.

Fever longer considered common symptom, aircraft carrier study, 0nly 5.3% cases presented fever. 15th birthday March. hope safe least grandmother maybe eat restaurant. Saying vaccine safe bullying. 

Lying people consequences actions order coddle helpful.

The vaccine absolutely safe claims otherwise irresponsible. I'm going spread damaging lies appease antivaxxers. vaccine safe. That's ""bullying"". 

Read actual clinical data trials. Source?  Alright, Florida doesn’t hold anymore (for long) volunteered guinea pig family. vaccine skeptical, worried rushed process. told report side effects. I'm worried. Dumbass China Source? disagree, frontline healthcare workers need vaccinated ASAP don’t keep personnel shortages due nurses, docs, EMS getting sick. hopefully talking holding vaccinating vulnerable individuals couple months worst. Well people color two choices take small chance major side effects new vaccine. 

Or taking small chance needing emergency care Covid getting proper care rate white people. 

Plenty actual evidence people color dying higher rates whites. It’s lose lose regardless. Trump right twice over. Sad media called liar. Lol yes, fucking stupid. selfish point evil. used think people fundamentally good, helpful people. year proven case. problem 70+ year olds, dead means 100% back normal, heard? Long-term effects also super duper mega rare, bother looking them. emotions front line workers.

I don’t think that’s correct term. You’re frontline worker. You’re last line defense. Everyone else frontline, masks, social distancing, testing key. Completely agree. medical center also received first bunch vaccines area. every medical stuff would like take that. one hand understand concerns vaccine itself; hand, worrying trust science study incredibly small amount men dealing MFI currently high. Regardless Covid. really seem proof reason numbers low poor truly due Covid. 

Also, thanks... two :) ICU nurse friend keeps claiming there's one hospital hoax.

Its weird time USA. HIPAA helping case. like masks/social distancing, honestly think people motivated idea getting ""back normal"" anything else. people know first realized vaccine goal, even feasible.  feel alone comes vaccine. first, like most, thought vaccine produced way quickly didn’t see getting it. Upon research, thanks sources cited Reddit subreddit, look things differently. There’s much misinformation many gullible people choose believe someone social media vs actual science. Whenever try talk someone subject, work (i work hospital), come across people 100% getting people want dump conspiracy theories me. Sucks. vaccine ready administer job could use fair opinions help decision making. I’m 80% leaning towards getting moment. seem ignore model active cases expected go 25%

But 25% people get sick die it. Saying they're 38% deaths 25% people get it, making implication numbers basically even implies elderly keep getting rate. that's doubtful. true, I'm sure providing argument wait. Getting vaccine usually reward risk. wanna go experience WAP club would rather cause would mean taking public transport want that. bloc solidarity guess. first batch vaccines hardly make difference anyways, wait produced. Basically, time enough people vaccinated make difference, really matter approved vaccine use 20 days earlier Hilarious! you...erm...""know""? immediate openings? White papers various research doctors scientists say vaccines problematic advice taking it. Hey now, Texans proud property taxes. Usually procedure includes phase independent experts publicly react data guys medical department university said example step skipped. also said propably political would say public might damage vaccination effort. propably Fauci 'clarified' initial reaction. government pressured expert rush cannot complain would damage process. like, 2 months. Yall thr beta testers, I'm good. 1. Yeah sorry geography important kind matters. 2.what samples goat papaya testing positive (link bottom article) California mess right now. many new daily cases death rate lags cases greatly increase.  “Prepare change” doesn’t seem reliable source. Wow! great news, makes hopeful return normalcy! Great news week. important thing getting people believe

Facts don’t matter, get times agree first, absolutely. 

Nurses hospitals part risk group - they're hospital, part risk group? 

Genuinely question only, know all. end justify means, comply!  really hope doesnt get sick works good things Actual anti-vaxers, sure. never going take begin with. I'm talking regular people blindly trust pharmaceutical CEOs. I'm means anti-vax wondering ""What's real reason want take it?"". I'd say big time $$$$ Well businesses still remain closed hospitalization numbers improve. Well, duh. Don’t think needed point out.  ""garbage garbage out"" would suffice explanation also. about...test things?

The White House tried that. They've multiple outbreaks point.

Testing replacement protective measures. Lmao you’re idiot, requiring driver’s license drive also infringe rights? Also actual evidence suggest new vaccines especially dangerous harmful skeptical afraid things don’t understand  Dont listen morons. You’re posting things people appreciate joy optimism. sad little trolls Yep! That’s due design lipid membrane containing mRNA strands actual strands themselves. It’s also virus since mRNA sequence complete cannot infect body.

There drugs took many years get approved find ended causing major issues people (if watch TV see ads class action lawsuits).

The bullying wrong needs stop. You’re misunderstanding messaging. Wear mask. get sent hospital severe case. group likely severe cases. many severe cases, send hospitals get overwhelmed

Any questions? it?

""I tested myself.""

""You data showing safe. used position jump queue."" job prove anything us? can't even get doctors give blessing eat fucking ham sandwich pregnant, think women run front line vaccine that's *never tested pregnant women* around long enough know affects vaccinated women get pregnant shortly thereafter?

Stop think second attacking people. neck gators accelerate transmission? doesnt seem logical me, provide source would like know Im wrong. Please dont take hostile, Ive seen claim around Yeah lol it’s going come getting vaccine bullet head wtf said results expected 2-3 months.

So we've come full circle. Believing blindly anything naïve irrational Religion, superstition). Questioning everything, including science rational.

Applied scenario: Believing blindly vaccine naïve; Questioning rational. Well first cases started showing december go two weeks earlier + minus week would make november Yes doubters took *fake* vaccine would compared many doubters vaccine isn’t safe he’d taken already.. Oh, I'm arguing many nurses superstitious. Definitely true. title paper seeing ""representing 19 diverse SARS-COVID-2 variants"" anywhere abstract.

COVID-21 come. also kill lot relatively benign germs, hindering normal immune system training? approved day duh  300 isnt nearly 500 even begin imagine pain grief go through, let alone families victims. rage inducing ppl take virus seriously. Sounds pretty suspicious me. except raw numbers make sense. agree 1/1000 much death illogical use raw numbers

raw deathload people still think usa top ten death impact top ten per capita.

And far proof, **DO** proof works. Please children. world already enough idiots. need adding willfully ignorant genes. r/Coronavirus threads Germany need Momma around slap stupid outta done testing every kind person.

I’ve witnessed meds advertised years later taken market. happens people suffer reactions weren’t known that’s science finds out. aren’t exempt possibilities. body could one rejects something reacts terribly. trying scare anyone stay aware informed. overall agree other. think difference reasonable doubts unfounded conspiracy? feel personally attacked lmaoooo Hold up, Faulk said natural immunity it. think Santa imposter. Vaccines eradicated polio vs trump republicans that... uh make shit go... yea, give vaccine.  using Facebook account? Lool seriously sounds like comments I've seen recent days Facebook people know clue? Hardly. Difficulties timely translation science policy late? Certainly. weeks wasted clinging ineffectual limited lockdown reduced impact economy. Since became abundantly clear work planned, lockdown significantly tightened starting tomorrow. likely Southern. Bay Area, still ICU capacity, running like places. 


LA, family lives, swamped. worry them. .. maybe ... know something don’t? lol ? Vaccine isn’t even FDA approved approved emergency use research. CEO Pfizer vaccine hasn’t even taken yet made lame ass excuse I'm glad Frontline workers health care plus assisted living residents getting it. general public hand, different selling point. faith nowhere found. guess much conspiracy nuts lost cause hut fence may say he's lying says  1 23,400 people developed narcolepsy, 0.004%. That’s much better around 1% dying coronavirus. fact, it’s *lot* better.

When we’re middle pandemic choice stopping deaths allowing continue - it’s longer hypothetical. Yeah us can’t exactly afford waste entire year life bro proof point kind dark something think about: need people trust vaccines. need work hard make sure start rollout stories ""My grandma got vaccine died"". start nursing homes first naturally coincidental deaths vaccine. start healthcare workers get folks covered also super important less likely trigger stories undermine trust vaccine. .... mrna vaccines humans, sars vaccine caused long term autoimmune problems animals, covid appears autoimmune condition, vaccine recommended individuals particularly harsh vaccine, talking ass multiple places condescending insulting? that? 

I think pretty clear. time Covid-21 strain start making rounds... seems spend time reddit echo-chambers, either seek out, cant recognize echo-chamber hits face. suppose person otherwise unhealthy and/or eating junk food high carbs, lots bad things could happen. deliberately eat lot saturated fats eat lot fat, saves lot inflammation. Something similar already happened week earlier Britain... single piece evidence support claim. better states.

You're defending position, trying deflect pointing others. path race bottom, objective measure, low go without worst. 40% country still refuses take vaccine. Cant achieve herd immunity folks refuse take vaccine first place.

Well point issue. long I'm vaccinated friends family, really care people refuse vaccinate aren't. I'll still wear mask I'm socially distancing 2 years might've said 40 years ago, 
""You trust science? must idiot."" vaccine candidate pipeline single shot, like J&amp;J Oxford. help speed immunizations. tested positive 1st month, fever 2 days, symptoms, tested positive yesterday. 
Am still **contagious**? played cousins church matter sit stranger's lap 85 strangers sat today? nothing like airplane masks.

Imagine virus onboard airplane .001% lethal everyone age 65. Would still give limited antidote people age 65 might ""protect us?"" No, would obviously try give every person age 65 first That's true. There's different calling people mean names advocating vaccines safe. 

I'm explaining anti-vaxxers consequences actions hurt people, mean names help anyone. Carson trusts god science cutting people. want comment mean books. Song dodo classic.

How risk pandemics originating bushmeat habitat encroachment compare posed industrial raising livestock? Great idea. everyone's position conclusively proven vaccinated people cannot transmit virus vast majority population vaccinated. think doctor? Ok, ha ha. vaccine doses divided state population I’ve read. ... quoted you.  sure, ya go: 1.
Political Context matter!

2.
You swap nose! prepare swap chemicals, neutralizes PH-Value pure Cola Papaya it! Phx AZ here. deliver hospitals. semis outside every hospital morgue overflow. point hear almost always running again. go hoping hear know. Good question. Yeah suspicious laws based information public knowledge. as, 1) knowing company made vaccine middle pandemic 2) information would released public next day. put order sale news released 8/20 still would made money, would appeared law abiding face possible investigation. 

If think way, might make sense you. Say news coming major problem company would cause stock drop value sells news released public. lose money owners stock know company poorly lost money. either scenario, sells cards stacked favor, ""insider info"", violation ""insider trading"" law. I'm happy positive news, yet sad someone like receive vaccine :( Paperwork clearly important human lives people. really can't imagine conscience people involved, say themselves: thousands people dying every day, better make sure papers right! i’m trying make people feel safe it, i’m going nationally ‘look see didnt die’ like see confidence CEO doesnt feel needs prove it, plenty people willing take limited supply already. basically says kid great, screw troublemakers need extra help There's confusion Oxford - data shoes they're least 62% effective, original 50% threshold. vaccine works - good Moderna works. Speed acceleration two different things. take calculus high school? ""fuck them"" reaction ""skeptics"" understandable explicitly counter interests public health. want change behavior, get many people vaccinated possible now, also develop trust vaccinations moving forward. ins't last pandemic we're going encounter, opinions related public health take long time change (like public opinion smoking diet/exercise) continue educate people help us next time. [We're actually 109x also, 4M tracking 30M devices, Americans. literally quoted bringing doctors mocked it.

Prove it. What? never called physician. go nursing school, paramedic school, later started going biochem goal becoming PA, decided go different path instead getting masters something else saying personal physicians say - saying. 

Is accusation doctors fine taking vaccine I'm lying? think doctors going let take vaccine already appears prone causing TM I've attack TM before? LOL feel like also tagged good news Legit question, anyone know getting vaccine means can't pass virus others? Like, get vaccine travel, pick give someone else? Long term effects vaccines exceedingly rare lot times precipitated things happen relatively quickly, like brain damage seizures caused vaccine. evidence anything like trial. Things could pop later like Guillam Barre exceedingly rare general, pretty rare anything adverse effect several months suddenly effect. yes, everyone concerned long term effects evidence thus far concern balanced known long term effects covid. known, bad, without vaccine high percentage chance personally get covid contend long term effects. perfect treatments, look potential side effects tylenol sometime get really horrified. comes balancing risk reward right vaccine would demonstrate awful lot harm outweigh risks associated covid. Dude you’re sheep believing that. I’m worried dying covid put I’m pretty sure it’s 1%death rate considering 300,000 people died America alone. Im worried infecting people family could actually die too. Also don’t want get fired job. Kudos taking big risks tho. ignore beginning quote? Great hear, thanks. think Walmart going hire people $12/hr check vaccine paperwork? Thank you, corporate overlords. I’ve commented specific subreddit maybe 5 times. Lol cling though. It’s easy. difference r/donaldtrump r/coronavirus one bi-partisan, flooded like-minded people attacking opposing views. somewhat expect r/donaldtrump echo-chamber, subreddit. acknowledged CDC recommending immunocompromised people, yet repeatedly said posts vaccinated. See issue here? People following guidelines, random person Reddit. SHOVE YESTERDAY LETS GO know downvoted. Everyone different experience isolation positives negatives everyone. It’s extremely brave publicly. Unfortunately, today’s political climate you’re basically choosing receive death threats wackos, become part ridiculous Q Trump fan fiction so. Protecting health around evil thing people’s eyes. 

I salute her. Might uses two different vectors two doses Oxford use Ever heard Robert Koch? lot knowledge bacteria comes him. lot equipment developed him. 

He created cure tuberculosis called tuberculin. Tuberculosis really bad thing back literally piles bodies. one could check well tuberculin works, since manufactured used behind closed doors. 

And turned out, cure tuberculosis - test see somebody infected. 

He believed cure. got famous lot advantages long body checked results.

And that's point, purpose rather know. That's point need check accepting something. Many people would absolutely hate see quarantine end. example coworkers bought new house 50 miles away work they'd screwed WFH ends. Oh yeah, know, that’s used quotation marks.  still going wear mask getting vaccinated. spouse long term health issues. likely line jab elderlies vaccinated.


Anything help normalize wearing masks little more, people want vaccine finally vaccinated. extremely harsh statement....Old sick people expendable. Healthcare workers not. one wants say that, truth. 1 person got bells moderna trial receive vaccine Jacobson decision upheld legality Massachusetts imposing fine refusing vaccination. make decision whether state actually compel vaccination. large difference. Lol vaccines arent That’s lot all. Idk usually I’d imagine it’s *at least* 5-10 times usually travel. That’s massive reduction. Imo healthy question drug developed, tested, approved year.

No, isn't.

You know anything vaccines. know long different stages development vaccines normally take, take long. know enough opinion whether vaccine safe not.

All either believe experts saying, believe it. vague intuition topic use.

None criticism, way things are. problem average person thinks complete ignorance combined reading news stories adding intuition somehow puts level vaccine researchers experts.

Most people know enough topics opinion. Wisdom realizing case. far understand (and might wrong), antibodies things actually fight virus. first time get infected, body first needs figure build antibodies **then** build them. virus gone, antibodies longer needed go away.

The second time encounter virus, body saved antibody blueprints last time, still takes bit time crank production, produce way faster time knows supposed build.

So, words, antibodies around body actively fighting virus right afterwards. already it, could still immune even without antibodies actively system, body still blueprints make short notice.

To take further, also vaccines work. give body dead version virus something looks lot like body figures antibody blueprint that. Later, encounter virus real world, body already knows fight it. doubt. That's reason isolate though. need find strategies make isolation bearable promote mental well being. model, see impact starting mid-January big impacts shown February.

I'm also INCREDIBLY interested default view rapid rollout instead seemingly risk-neutral rapid rollout know happen. point got questioning whole model people building it.

Is ""Current projection"" also risk-neutral rollout vaccine target high risk people early phases? 1. social events happening 2. finally time get tested ADHD, since ADHD meds also used help binge eating disorders + unmanaged ADHD make addressing harder point? odds getting GBS flu significantly higher odds getting vaccine. wanna perform Bass-to-Mouth local fishery. want take vaccination asap visit places becoming slave paycheck again. Austria Australia - political Context matter!

- poured Cola test didn’t use test directed - example chemicals prepare probe, neutralize PH-Value!

- swap nose! must forget return normal gradual process, instant switch. incremental steps (i.e. outdoor dining reopening, indoor dining bars reopening, nightclubs entertainment venues etcetera) make vaccination process lot bearable. Science require trust. beauty it. think comments threads failing strategies countries try deflect saying many countries also succeed?  saved work replying. Yes, that's absolutely correct obvious anyone common sense, hardly needing authority point out. I'd call saying ""a word wise"". **Of course** *any* emergency situation try safeguard vulnerable first. **of course** less vulnerable continue danger **until** ""loaded lifeboats"". 

About 19 times 20 (or more) totally accurate concluding 'anger-bot' never read spitting at. rare occasion 'have' done manner usually implied word ""read"" ie thought reading.

If person eternal quest 'gottcha moment' emotional reward pronounced. subject 'gottcha' happens part something fashionable hate circles 'gottcha' reward even greater. personal satisfaction also feeling 'belonging' group. Hating definitely checklist requirements belonging certain internet fashion. Strangely, perhaps strangely, reasons usually mentioned almost always miss mark wrong real real world. Forgetting swine flu vaccines europe? children got narcolepsy? 

I take vaccine nonetheless, government still making vaccinationplan lol Small businesses already hurting. customer small business expect know outbreaks cases, would expect anyone working negative test said outbreak. Anyone medical field take vaccine lose license. sympathy uninformed grandmas buy Facebook memes, anyone treats people know better. speaks itself. . . Get it?! :)  Authorize what? second vaccine widespread enough I’m never wearing another mask long live already single dose safety data. even know long double dose immunity lasts elderly comorbidities. best way protect quickly achieve herd immunity done best single dose. point is, level actions taking producing result worse states taking drastic actions. case, point taking drastic actions?

We could locked homes eaten canned food 6 months covid cases would gone way see people advocating that. finding correct balance believe Florida achieved much better states. think doctor? Ok, ha ha. three locations business CA. close 1,000 employees total Southern California.

We’ve gone 1-2 cases per week 7-9 cases per location per day. 135 new cases state past 17 days.

Our Nevada locations 22 past 7 days 800 employees.

Our North Carolina location 6 week 200 employees

Our Florida location 4 week 350 employees.

All in, company 6,500 employees, around 700 cases since March 400 past 30 days. lost first employee two weeks ago looks like two week. thought 4 vaccine group 0 placebo group? said comment, vaccinate tens thousands people 2 weeks. 52% efficacy one dose alone, lot lives potentially saved. ""populism"" literally save hundreds thousands lives, moral imperative opinion. cannot ""just isolate distance"" FFS, everyone privilege plus many fatalities we've far exactly measures? good enough sir. Explain mean process playing normally? Normally, patients discharged place residence, nursing home. “normal” place discharge to? people decide live lives fear everything. lad gets bit jail time, happy, need calling names right? seem think so. Non-asymptomatic

This sounds like roundabout way saying symptomatic. Already, mask Nazis busy spinning another web lies control people. ""Oh, even though vaccinated basically immune, dare take mask tell okay take off.""

I assume takes second dose, good take mask right?  Oh like one. Work top tier hospital. confirm. “denier” per se, many RN among first get vaccine anybody awe regarding achievement ignorant entitled piece shit

The thing grotesque statement number upvotes received. Badlands. don’t feel comfortable taking right now. 
My ego preggo, I’ll nursing baby likely, went anaphylactic shock receiving iron infusion therapy 😂 People anyways. millions people vaccinated flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, measles. idea looking them. Guess barricade in.  Seriously, say ONE bad thing US watch quickly get banned. People defensive America it’s pathetic. Bourla joined Pfizer 1993, first serving doctor veterinary medicine technical director company's animal health division Greece.

He's vet, ha ha, although also led Pfizer's work cancer heart drugs held role global vaccines chief (Wiki). agree he's management scientific side, bet taken saying personal PR. Lol wow, take somewhat reasonable response previous comment ruin one.

Problem statement clinical trials prove negatives. There's nothing antivax here.. wife strong proponents vaccines facts pregnant women studied clinical trials. 10% doctors idiots Well duh. 1M doses go 500K people really impact 350M people quickly? Takes 1+ month person get shots work. first testing Americans British. ""it is""

"" mom nurse 25 years resigning position want take vaccine. Facebook hell drug going headline hate science talked like religion though something trust believe in.

It makes religious choice instead methodology process. “Put objectively less tested vaccine body selfish moron”

I guess don’t support body autonomy lmao pretty messed Lockdowns far stopped health services overwhelmed. happens we'd fucked. Yeah could get secretly one would know Wow live? Everyone Florida able things mentioned whole semester like mass body pit See, man part problem. original comment comment asking information learn from. it’s pointed information doesn’t actually provide hard facts scientific information response turns “fuck um that’s issue.” Lol wElL ShEePlE fair, think Pfizer believe took lead testing. Honestly, right.

Given bad anti-maskers anti-vaxxers are, many anti-maskers ALSO anti-vaxxers? shock there's large portion Americans far gone come ""get vaccine get bullet head"", they'd say ""go ahead shoot me, I'd rather die get autism get chip put me!"" alot like majority trust science aswell. However, trust currupt human beings massive corporations pay billions dollars malpractice lawsuits. 

Each own. 

Chow. Yeah, everyone forget Federal involvement distribution PPE? *Republican voters* forgot that? There's point making effort, nice assumptions though. obviously resigned knowledge kill someone out, odds knowing meeting grieving family nil. 

You're one failed human guy. Yeah would great. Especially EU Germany. could ensure doses vaccines would need. Ever since announced vaccine people care anymore. I've dealt people DHHS literally told keep masks public areas like literal fuck. can’t speak NY NJ don’t enough information would assuming. However, PA filled hospitals. PA one least hit pandemic sense. PA began struggling since 17-30,000 person rallies every week/multiple times week late October/early November. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Used /r/CanadaCoronavirus, links US states' COVID subs, regional areas, etc. Moreover, people talk lot improbable vaccine side-effect, potential long-term COVID side effects. lose smell COVID ACE2 receptors binds around olfactory support cells damages them. damage happening wherever ACE2 receptors i.e. organs, brain spinal cord. notice smell cause deprives one sense. mean yes, wasn’t justifying care happiness small abstract chance I’ll “kill” stranger. 

My point it’s stupidity. 
I would wager intellectually challenged one rather asserting claims simply said “whatever”   wasn’t arguing you, I’m letting know you’re bit cunt. CEO gets vaccine first: ""Yet another rich person taking advantage capitalism.""

CEO get vaccine first: ""The vaccine must unreliable"" Plenty info neck gaitors perfectly fine. makes sense. It’s piece cloth, droplets aren’t going get easily open air. Ugh... 0 doubt vaccines relative safety this. CEO Pfizer? people literally increase drug prices costing people lives order get bigger Christmas bonus won’t take vaccine “cut line.” FML believing earnest hard do... scientists developed vaccines make order treat people certain race cause harm people races. controversial statement??? Interesting. knew common potatoes nowadays.

What pandemic brought light people pretty stubborn set ways. Contrary tell ourselves, humans need guidance direction. 

The proof pudding, countries strictly locked stuck it, virus control totally eradicated it. 

Whereas, tell *Meh rights* place, 300,000 officially dead exact period. 

Granted, another human trait shove head sand double whenever they're wrong. Especially country culture brainwashed folks birth they're #1. Right, entire global medical research community focusing single goal 10 months first reliable solution worth billions dollars enough reason? fact SARS research already existed/been works decades COVID-19 merely accelerated extreme speeds?

Vaccines build herd immunity. refusing actively willingly put people risk medically able take it. Herd immunity defense requires rest population vaccinate.

It's stop selfish moron help rest world there's availability so. that's people japan get hit hard Uh yeah increased viral load caused largely inadequate ppe thought primary reason many young medical professionals dying. whole thing like textbook example create anti-vaxxers.

Step one: call “operation warp speed”

Step two: appoint former director many millions stock options Moderna lead said operation

Step three: announce Moderna leading vaccine despite never developing vaccine before, leader.

Step four: you, likely safe effective. isn’t enough safe effective. needs safe, effected, also trusted order work.

Doing shit like fucks critical trust part. Sure maybe way leader OWS could influenced this. simply way lay person know enough inner workings system totally sure.

And isn’t like, wake opioid epidemic, reason trust big pharma won’t taint medical system profits expense health. isn’t like last 4 years government given us reason believe corruption, profiteering, political self interest won’t get way public well-being. sub people claiming ""know"" tests negative ones know clinical trial requires? 

**Time**

to observe report effects drugs patients. seen 30,000 people affected vaccine yet. 

It bit odd Pharmaceutical CEO stand behind product. That's I'm saying.   understand first paragraph good information. second one much. Rough, husband ED doc one ICUs city 2 intensivists 12 hr shifts 7 days week months. asked ED docs take shifts help. got vaccinated yesterday take shifts since works 12 shifts month. Yesterday caught aortic dissection 29 year old patient resident mentioned pt abdominal pain-while seeing 58 12 hrs. Pt would've discharged. One friends suffering severe neurological/cognitive effects CV hospitalization July encephalitis/seizures/severe hypertension, mess. PICU/NICU RN we've kids MISC Covid. vaccine next week. dad died 2 months ago home hospice lung CA bone mets-only diagnosed March year. family robbed able chemo/radiation appts hospitalizations, besides hub checking since hospital worked at. dad came home completely dying, full care, 86 lbs much pain going feeding tube new chemo-still alert/oriented ambulatory. idea he'd speak us got brought home via ambulance hospice took sharp left turn died 2 week period, able spend time talking/preparing/etc. funeral yet either. going PTSD forever past year. living nightmare. mom's best friend husband covid husband died EMTs could get wife watching, husband's group lost amazing Nurse Practitioner quarantined home died 12th day getting bit better days 9-11. could go forever....I listen podcast doc Dr Peter Hotez Dr Paul Offit lot smart point everything they've discussed past 11 months. recommend friends fam listen educational (It's Dr Zubin Damania's) misappropriation word ""force"" understanding implemented.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* can't prove negative. Take antivax bullshit back anti science subreddits welcome it. absolutely agree depends level seriousness. One mistakes made top comment assuming baseline same. haven’t seen level seriousness stage week four pandemic occurring. watched many many many people go wearing mask door step location go 50 person parties. Ohio said releasing vaccination dashboard later week. Probably next couple weeks states also one, sites start creating aggregate data. going pay stay home? can't prove negative. Pregnant women usually recommended ever get vaccines even counter medicine body chemistry gets fucky that's group rarely ever tested. sources claim ""they've got infected now""? Fauci said get vaccinated camera. Past presidents said they’ll same. many people need vaccinated camera convince 40%? Hey sparky that's works. job prove negative, *your* job prove cause complications. 

You're correct saying job prove it. however job companies producing vaccines governments certify them. Pregnant women **always** left clinical trials ethical concerns. point available data pregnant Unknown? Without proof either side? WTF talking about? really fucking stupid think they're pushing vaccine us without testing first? 

Absolutely not. understand trial data results people classification personally would like receive vaccine. however zero data available, UK stated pregnant women receive it, US CDC FDA stated opt-in moment, experts concur lack far proof, **DO** proof works. Please children. world already enough idiots. need adding willfully ignorant genes. 

You're correct saying proof vaccine working interested receiving vaccine. concern lack data pregnant/soon pregnant women. women became pregnant trial removed.

Nothing I've stated illogical fear COVID causes warped perception everything. understand pregnancy involved things ALWAYS complicated. releases vaccine data widely produced. one would give af gets it. What? thats true. building coal plants doesnt help reduce emissions all. Disassemble old ones switch parts power grid renewables would.

You see Im going? low level antibody tests means cold virus antibodies detected (certain Cold virus antibodies cause false positives COVID antibody test.) whole thing like textbook example create anti-vaxxers.

Step one: call “operation warp speed”

Step two: appoint former director many millions stock options Moderna lead said operation

Step three: announce Moderna leading vaccine despite never developing vaccine before, leader.

Step four: you, likely safe effective. isn’t enough safe effective. needs safe, effected, also trusted order work.

Doing shit like fucks critical trust part. Sure maybe way leader OWS could influenced this. simply way lay person know enough inner workings system totally sure.

And isn’t like, wake opioid epidemic, reason trust big pharma won’t taint medical system profits expense health. isn’t like last 4 years government given us reason believe corruption, profiteering, political self interest won’t get way public well-being. worries, plenty idiots profession like others. conspiracy wary rapidly produced vaccine human history? One produced group people (Pharma) shown time time prioritize profit margins people. Additionally, given time frame development, can’t possibly know long-term effects literally enough time type longitudinal study.

Doesn’t sound like conspiracy me. Sounds like basic logic. r/madlads Bad Santa Reddit moment. Ok? like somehow disprove said? Jab butt. No, kids icreases carbon footprint. kids something decreases it. Thats same.

You cant ""balance out"" going flight example kids. NP wanted flu shot paper could show job, questioning said “I don’t want fake stuff”.

She ended getting flu shot taking away paperwork, imagine type healthcare provides can’t even back flu shot. publicly scrutinized vaccine trial human history yeah decent amount reason expect low rate complications. absolutely disgusting used innocent kid. understand, proposed system scientists would come together arrange builders create lab, everyone would work harmony free without kind management all. I’m nurse dedicated COVID hospital. nurses work don’t want don’t trust vaccine fast. get but, actually cared GBS patients less 3x life due flu vaccine. it’s like they’re safe. “Trusting tested hypotheses...”

Well that’s thing right brand new technology tried first time rushing usual period time takes fully test, vet, get approved. don’t disagree gist comment feel like you’re ignoring pretty significant factors play here. 

As healthy 26 year old make sense get vaccinated risk corona negligible. continue err side caution. vaccine conspiracy theorism. agree others comments took dose, ""skeptics"" would saying took saline shot. see form communication downvoted? Instead articulating feelings facts decided stupid began shitting key fact “I’m pretty sure...” hey, live anti-vax family refusing vaccine bc ""unknown side effects."" let get one thing straight - THOUGHT ""side effects"" vaccine could show within matter months, could show matter years... correct? 

(because would see side effects people took vaccine early haven't) assuming phases take 3 months vaccinate? Phases aren’t divided equal number people. timeline December vaccinated way beyond experts timeline estimates? Why? ""people"" issue it, that's fine too. fucking problem. Public schools require it. majority issues anti vax nutters come private schools. think right thing .. hes wealthy man morals. bet alot super wealthy ppl going try skip line Redditors probably never stepped foot managers office perhaps even corporate building general sharing opinions think others lmao. Victoria (state Australia) intent 5 weeks, turned 6 months thanks people following rules. effectively infection free (until people flew last week, locked quarantine 2 weeks hotels). Cmon now, stop making shit  countries' leaders getting long well. independent review leading experts, course.

You've got healthcare workers vulnerable populations taking now. board likely public display taking vaccine wrap vaccinating two groups—at least US. Say 60% adults absolutely get vaccine, that's million people. Even guys wait month open public, they'll still getting vaccinated people ghost concern it. literally take certain vaccines medical professional practice many possibility significant side effects. Requirements vary per state somehow think one might maybe list. can't force someone get absolutely show door refuse. isn’t entirely correct.  Couldn’t care less think people mad fact society literally shutdown hospitals claim overwhelmed. Like they’re tiktok dances. Oh I'm stuck (place get it) place gonna do? Make discount permanent. problem vaccine helps fight virus keep getting spreading it. asymptomatic infectious ~3 days vaccinated person, eschew masks social distancing, going spread population even quicker without vaccine. 

Higher infection rates, lower mortality rates happen. Got it. Well thanks spreading word. Without vaccines. 

WITH vaccines it’s even pointless. genuinely making arguments me. 

And would insanely mean INSANELY rare vaccine reduce symptomatic infection reduce chances transmitting. talking like 1% chance case. HAIs really big concern outpatients, i.e. vast majority people seeing doctors given time? don’t think bugs me: ""shutdowns complex two sides blah blah blah"". Yeah get that. economic hardships shutting down. There's masks. Masks one easiest things combat virus. cost anyone much, I'm sure could provide surgical masks need wanted to. prevent shopping store going sporting events (although think things), mask mandates, contrarian, enlightened person knows unwashed fearful masses. friend group also got type stomach bug club NYE. week plus, really bad shape. known then. week mentioned packed sports stadiums Summer 2021, flip flopping makes sense trump idiot. unfortunately, good portion base believes anything guy says.  


you can't change stupid, sort thing continue happen places taking seriously. still christmas new year's eve contend with, i'm sure cause another spike people entitled privileged ""inconvenienced"". me, /u/Undaine I'm sure appreciate wishes. Federal government effectively also print money taking loans don’t plan paying back going debt without issues. would like know Denmark able control well, compared Germany example. Considering we're 2,500 deaths day rising, 200,000 deaths seems optimistic. Hopefully he's right I'm wrong. It’s getting brigaded today. People sub completely detaching reality 😂 too, beatiful number like simetry, happens century...

Also begining new decade etc...

I never special feelings year numbers expected 2020 good year. Living woods alone must pretty chill given current situation. Yes quite comparable. I'm afraid case much longer. So, let's hope there's doubling down. Fine me, us! called silly think you’re directly injecting covid, 😂 isnt vaccination works, silly goose. 

Waiting see long term effects going take several years, couple weeks. hope stay inside then. Sky blue agree can’t trust data. Jhonson&amp;jhonson said thing pounder years later result ovarian cancers people became sterile something deemed safe. believe data don’t always lie private means private can’t trust science religiously. Probably it’s safe good intention there’s always potential government corporate control know two far trustworthy. drugs hurts people today approved FDA ( government safe) adversed safe prouvent data science know addiction crises have. Remember scientific data encouraging smoking early days? century dead people 🫁 cancer something started getting done ultimately data questioned. believe science mot religiously. Sometimes go drive get fresh air. Along road take there’s steakhouse parking lot **always** full groups people entering exiting restaurant. People don’t give damn virus, it’s sad. also think state governments giving OK business reopen given folks false impression it’s safe eat joints. matter says. country fully normal drop restrictions end spring. Put reminder bot come recheck comment 6 months. could build mask protect others, wouldn’t you? That’s conversation need start having. hard people understand ? neighbouring countries still far less restrictive measures many hard-hit places Europe, though.

While agree Sweden handled much worse neighbours, issues much complex merely matter pro vs anti lockdown. like corona strategy much strictness restrictions. Maximum amount *relatively benign* pathogens. COVID-19 relatively benign. Yes, even though 0.1% chance killing whatever - that's actually really high chance considering effect has. Give apostrophe symbol! quite ring it. Obviously different experiences, I'd say freshman year college year made lasting friendships one year. sure you’re looking per capita data? per capita Netherlands done quite poorly. Well sarcastic extent, would argue masks ""0.0000"" they're mouth. might true breathing thing happened mouths, but, know, throw things like coughing talking yelling Trump election, mask mouth catch fair bit contaminate.

But yes, holes preferred. Well ever good feelings upcoming year future, sure give heads prepare supplies. GNU/Linux Stallman quote? lmao Seriously, flu shots take it, you’re good activities. shot, may pipe day two. needs said garner trust. right. big deal can't see glasses they're fogged up. everyone wear contact lenses. countries believed seasonal effect, Sweden believed herd immunity. I'd recommend listening one recent episodes podcast talk issue Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer trying convince administration months order 200 million doses vaccine first batch. deal set place put financial Pfizer; US govt made larger order vaccines' clinical trial data turned shit, Pfizer would absorbed financial loss United States government penny vaccines failed. still unclear government place larger order means additional 90 days next 100 million Americans able get vaccinated Pfizer since EU bought vaccines meantime. United States tried seize vaccines EU, would create geopolitical crisis likes unseen modern times would imagine like Pizer CEO, said willing soon it’s available them. don’t want take somebody’s spot needs first. LOL, sorry, bad. Either way, hell ride, right? thank caring others. Excellent! good news, I'm happy them. must feel pretty good no? it. vaccines without? know effective masks impact viral load vaccinated, Mr. Scientist?  That's important time distinction me...I cross-country train trip August I'd like dining sightseeing cars open. helps - mother genetic disease. Scientists major break year, first kind specific genetic mutation. goes well healthy volunteers getting treatment now, receive 2021. Grab hope hold on! hey agree sub sometimes looked around right? Half people wear masks I'm fine getting booster every fall along flu shot. one died Moderna vaccine. date, California 538 deaths per million Netherlands 593 deaths per million. We'll see changes coming weeks far California hit almost hard Netherlands. sarcastic. point game, people taking seriously, well, deserve get.  


as say, ignorance bliss. wondering blissful they're feeling right now. nephew year old grown world adult faces he's seen besides parents covered up. harm done young children? remember reading theory allergies auto-immune disorders caused immune system enough real germs fight, could pseudoscience. I’ll take cold twice year wear mask this. shouldn’t wane faster immunity natural infection, certainly. reinfection rates quite low, promise t-cell immunity providing protection quite time. 

If vaccine immunity wane, does, infection rates (assuming people vaccinated) already low. won’t giant tsunami infections once, start revaccinating population gets control.

Researchers follow participants clinical studies got vaccinated early continue measuring antibodies, give indication long shots effective well. 

By time, stockpiled vaccine distribution won’t massive issue now. Ticketmaster uses vaccine credentialing service IBM Yeah, many vaccines right now, tens thousands need encouragement yet. can't encourage people take vaccine there's vaccine give them. get turn. Idk I'm even arguing clearly understand. He's even household name, people going change mind this. confirmed BBC Radio Ulster case hospitals across North 7pm evening. Terrifying. I’m sorry you’ve go this. Thank everything you’ve done. hope get break soon. Simple require proof vaccination everything like jobs, social assistance, healthcare, etc. card, help. Go die corner parking lot. space relatively fine. space nothing consequence done prepare second wave. killed heated RNA could fall apart, yes. assume temperature failsafes alarm desired range however happen long period time person injected nothing “bad” would happen...the RNA would destabilized little oil goes tissue. However, vaccine failed.

Since temp big hurdle, it’ll handled extreme care — vaccine brought liquid injection isn’t like -94F whole time. think COVID flu huh? annual flu vaccine side effects?

I always feel like shit day two get flu vaccine. beats feeling like dying whole week.  Lmao quote trying say? anthrax vaccine 90s given US soldiers caused disability well. 2020 hope everyone learned Sweden, USA, Uk shining lights world instead Japan, China South Korea. don’t look like idiots do. world remember. imagine isolating, followed rules, managed make safe vaccine day, get shot go back normal life discover among 5.5% wich vaccine effective. Lmao arguing philosophical concepts already named people smarter I've rabies vaccine before, felt sick 5-7 days afterwards! similar argument could made every year flu vaccine. Everyone get 1% immunocompromised. 

But that's works. feel need vaccine risks presented. simple. Happy early birthday fellow March dude! disease different, that’s ok believe. 2022 herd immunity come summer? makes sense many doses get this? 100 million Pfizer doses, there's 100 million these, we'll still need 400 million vaccinate everyone. Delayed gratification. bit bitter bullet put work could nice things like NZ Aus. us North Americans selfish stupid soooo wait vaccines get control. Trump boasted developing vaccine. take Trump-vac(tm) defend hoax virus (he called china virus again, twice, boasting video)?  grew rural county two counties away Klamath. Even we, mostly conservatives, jokes everyone Klamath inbred, fucked sheep, belonged KKK.

Well, since lockdown lockdown would happened without vaccine since vaccine cannot stop lockdown 2 weeks matter individual protection population immunity matter short term individual protection( difference regular emergency approval) emergency approval vaccine compared short term individual level protective meassures effects relevantly better distancing. acceptance vaccine suffers procedure changed faster approval damaged main point population immunity.

Bushamalinton gonna get live Tv 😂 say. wonder much shares big pharma. yeah, mean, gonna nation-or-worldwide announcement ""resume normal life"". personally decide life feels 'normal' means, remembering always see others still wearing masks.

Anyway, IDK 'resuming normal life' means more. Human empathy displayed COVID displayed COVID, maybe. son asked one masks friends lipreaders starts get beard show off.

Man, tell lies easily breathe. hook lost worm Thank you! frustrated reading thread, people bad ""COVID hoax"" anti vaxxers spreading misinformation distrust. worry they're going reason Herd immunity sooner rather later.

I'm know planning it: Long term care facilities, rest homes assisted living facilities 2nd highest priority first Phase.

 [COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions | Sucks can't vaccines huh. good question I’ve answered already, above. Absolutely. think it’s also important point lack actual scientific coursework nursing requires. take physiology, anatomy, micro, pharmacology—and use little education day-to-day work, it’s easily forgotten. Even rigorous nursing degrees often filled fluff “nursing theory” courses rather learning (more in-depth medical science). could rant forever NP schools education absolutely dismal (at expense practitioner patient), digress. 

Important point nursing incredibly important, I’m thankful amazing ones there. However recognize society nursing education lend credentials ID physicians, epidemiologists, virologists speak public health matters like vaccines. That's article says  nonsense Ah well known vaccine company Modern understand it, suggesting there's cancer risk? 

That would like saying: 

I, lay person re: astronomy, fully understand rocket launches. also randomly postulate spacex rockets crash gps satalites?

By putting scaremonger, impact read it. want ask question - phrase such. reading misled thinking speaking knowledge. someone taking care patients families left behind insulting. 

You going site politically guided justice department source. Trump AGs weaponized pass blame Trump democractic governors. 

Politifact goes well. lot nuance blowing over. blame Cuomo, yes. CDC cited two ""key factors"" consider deciding whether discharge patient COVID-19 long-term care facility, said Kristen Nordlund, CDC spokesperson. First, patient medically ready discharge long-term care facility? second, selected long-term care facility able safely care patient recovering virus implementing recommended infection control procedures? directives place March 23, two days state issued advisory. nursing homes felt pressure accept COVID-positive patients, actually forced so. State regulations require nursing homes accept patients care them, could refused grounds.

In addition, it’s unclear extent governor’s policy responsible nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control longstanding problem nursing homes predates pandemic report showed peak numbers nursing home deaths came prior peak influx patients result Cuomo’s advisory. mandate testing time Cuomo's order. order. Testing mentioned all. Unless aware order.

Do remember testing mandate this? enough testing kits CDC bungled testing roll lost month two lead virus. 


The prohibition testing tests people reasonable amount time clear hospitals sick people. probably cost people lives. one ever comes alternative. alternative people stayed hospital, potentially filled covid till take anyone. Oh go business CMS pay care.


But complete republican hit job shift blame Trump democratic governors. federal disaster continued lack federal response. Convenient Trumps people focus first 6-40 thousand deaths gloss hundreds thousands since then. wish got half attention right wing media first victims did. knew got shit got really bad. someone teen, sucked life altering. slight difference smile one side face thirty years later, unless know look never know.
 
It's going stop taking vaccine first day can. may well want optics ""Fuck rich guy getting vaccine me!"" ""Fuck, rich guy get *he* made it, I'm getting thing either"". Registering vaccine completing phase 3 trials &amp; releasing data without much transparency normal. sufficient evidence people question Russia regarding vaccine. reddit. curiosity deaths, general, year year would less space morgue? comment \^ think that’s idea, yeah. clear space people need care get unlucky otherwise leave everyone decide risk management. think starts happening around spring. Bro, earned it. fine Right, new delivery method. think there's anything wrong suspicious.

It's like pharmaceutical industry EVER pushed dangerous drugs us before. I'll bet bowl warm coleslaw brain. See? we're saying shit without single piece data back up. Post source comments move on. Thank You! Basically, yeah I'm saying inadequate. asking stage thought inadequate. I'm saying trials faster history. ok people weeks cautious someone else. saying experts governments approving one another, yet thread talking experts authorities quite yet. I'm saying anyone wrong, patient understanding everyone going exactly page this. kinds risk significant. Capturing wild animals shipping live markets certainly poses risks. Habitat encroachment likewise. Industrial-scale raising domestic animals play role too—as outbreak Nipah virus among pig farmers pork dealers Malaysia 1998. Beautiful read. Hope make sanity learned father weekly call Sunday promptly passed fuck out. Never happened before. Gave wife kids quite scare. original commenter acting method delivery thoroughly tested “40 years”. true. Everything total derailed stream nonsense really related original comment. different ceo pharma company taking vax. completely oblivious message. 

This dude sold 60% stock day Pfizer came positive 90% effective press release. corrected 96 percent moderna came said 95%. smells like bullshit 80 percent Americans saying “wtf”. Spoken like one never put hard days work entire life. would know even grueling 12 hour shifts harsh conditions folks often find way enjoy little things, find something celebrate enjoy coworkers friends.

I concede seem modicum self awareness here. know going flat out, busting ass 10 months straight would whimpering pile human jello would shake like shitting dog stiff breeze. Fortunately folks day day bit fortitude do.

These folks almost certainly working hard, think people would concede shitty time healthcare care. Let celebrate universally good news 30 seconds dancing Christs sake. Thanks. Yeah first infection scary quickly went totally fine spreading veins arm. Pretty sure I’d goner situation hospitals overwhelmed. 

Sorry hear Grandma. many hidden non-Covid victims plague. 

I live Wales came lockdown several weeks ago. Cases rising rapidly we’re back 400 per 100,000. 

It’s astonishing people resisting masks. It’s bare minimum needed control pandemic. Unfortunately it’s silver bullet either. excellent mask compliance, don’t see anyone public place indoors wearing one now. it’s stopping surges. 

For schools big one. Several work team got diagnosed (along whole family) week got kids, got school. 

That people socialising other’s houses. case coronavirus, CFR would inaccurate majority cases slip radar. probably accurate go estimated IFR instead calculating simply detected cases. clear suspicions. Yes, mRNA vaccines seen risky people strong reactions certain substances. never rejected that. strong allergic reactions anything, notify doctor. fairly strong reaction smoking cessation drugs (I came hives) tell doctor get vaccination. Let's begin remarking hardly believe 'effectiveness numbers', released one other, various competing manufacturers anywhere near firm. Truly knowing efficacy preventing disease something known **can't** known now. Summing results done *historically*, least *months* problem often *years* after. 

The various vaccine makers relying indirect measures reasoning there. One antibody response. presuming stronger antibody response less chance recipients catching disease, severe, mild asymptomatic. conclusion fewer people disease less transmission occur. 

A second line evidence presented **limited** data released say people placebo groups catch disease vaccinated groups. numbers quite small, depend real picture.

 seen statements manufacturers trying break small number cases mild severe cases arguing vaccine 'may' lessen severity disease. So, yes, 'tried' address problem, problem essence mention. 'Their' problem numbers trials caught disease small even give truly accurate picture total effectiveness let alone breaking 'failures' spectrum severity. 

So..... claims effectiveness understood terms statistical reliability. 95%, instance, could well turn 85% said done, hopefully 2022 perhaps even later. concern actually well merited, far we, public, know much unknown. Maybe evidence *pooled* data various Chinese vaccines. apparently vaccinated close million people far, countries combined. will, however, waiting long, long time honest answer quarters. wanna walk house random store without thinking it. mean? 1,600 enough achieve statistical significance long sample representative population (which fair big ""if"" surveys like these, fixed bigger *n*)  course, makes difference. government indeed support business affected pandemic financially. Still that's part businesses miss money wise. Hopefully enough businesses survive, will.

People work get financial support also, always case. think many, including myself, “normal” means feeling safe hang friends, see older family members, book flight. actually don’t see going back massless things like planes far I’m concerned, go live life please without stopping first ask reconsider plans, I’ll accept normal! mostly, although we'll also get initial ""VACCINES RESUME NORMAL LIVES""...and tonso f people go out, assuming 'other vaccinated people' somehow protect them.

so quite reversed coronavirus constantly mutating replicates different individuals. mutations spread throughout population—either chance, marginally adaptive value. Natural selection. mutation known D614G spread broadly around world, though scientists still divided whether gives virus adaptive advantage. I’m sure “new strain” UK you’re talking about. small mutations unlikely provide strain virus escape good vaccine. accumulation significant mutations might eventually that, there’s evidence far. Probably can’t “prove” got work. Like subjected multiple mass super spreading events people wearing masks maybe got grocery store? thing suspect science Yeah, think that's lot governments doing. That's whole meaning behind 'flattening curve'.

So get point hospitalization rates dropped high-risk population vaccinated, feel like time start going back normal even cases still high.  15, partying grandma top list. Good cause unknown, thought inflammation. getting multiple times common, could screen way - common.

It's surprise vaccine may carry risk - right background population number cases still. definitive there's risk not, hence recommendation monitor. turned risk, would tiny - since we're what's expected population still, there's hardly increased odds ratio.

Oh also - infection virus also thought cause bell's... Sooooooo *shrug* Highly? Ah see. Usually mortality rates measured CFR since IFR hard measure (as many asymptomatic patients). morons wrote article never say UVC light breads RNA &amp; DNA chain virus..... technology around years, LED lights That's sorta thought... like little bit both... fact going lot harder get people compliant problem ostensibly ""solved"" effect due logistical issues. immune still carrier. Wow, thank you. 

Things polarized right honestly read times looking sarcasm punchline. 

I think really important. everyday, pro-science, follow evidence, Redditors showing apprehension towards something, people think average person feels like reads headlines? 

Thankfully I'm healthy I'll get benefit waiting without making decision, lot at-risk people facing issue *right now*. 

It's everyone's best interest society convinced safe, callous ""who cares"" responses part mindset got us here. well, know seventy four million people willfully ignorant afraid education, actively tune state propaganda 'news' channels actively disinform covid Also extremely high reduction rate severe covid. downloaded one area, don’t see contact tracing makes sense pandemic strategy US anymore. around 2.5 million cases last 2 weeks person generated around 10 contacts would around 25 million Americans quarantine right now. that’s detected infections, scientists estimate still catching around 1 3 1 4 infections.

At point assume anyone doesn’t live household everyone works home doesn’t go potentially infected. makes much sense contact tracing would either quarantine everyone lockdown implement enforce mask mandates targeted restrictions affect everyone. course consider economic mental health effects measures too, days contact tracing seemed like feasible solution gone. really, I’ve said local government came straight said almost primarily eyeball hospitalizations discussing/implementing restrictions. id imagine case counts alone really enough justify much disruption. specific number mind. think goal entire time make sure hospitals overrun, get enough high-risk population vaccinated way hospitals overrun, need start resuming normal life. We’ve studied effects vaccine less year. It’s first kind licensed US. isn’t vaccine that’s tried tested decades. It’s fear causing autism, implanting chips brain. isn’t typical anti-vax argument. 

Using cover calling someone anti-vax pressure take rushed vaccine wrong. 

In end day, people aren’t getting first. privilege watch healthcare workers take first. able use period data research, paint full picture. Hopefully, picture continue depict vaccine truly effective safe. read test positive weeks, fever 14 days since initial symptoms think would considered contagious. go wild anyway still masking, etc. Upon first inspection, Wolfgang shunned medical community number things including calling pandemic regular flu.Yeadon called COVID vaccines, lockdowns October claimed pandemic over. So, keep mind clear untrue. paper, two major points make release vaccine somewhere line major issues occur people trust vaccines. major medical claim make cause infertility women. evidence suggest that. protein vaccine they're referencing apart makeup COVID, neither vaccine COVID shown evidence causing infertility. So, want believe causes infertility women woman take it, better shut want catch COVID either. asleep dude, late work, wake up! Oh, like Trump. I'm guessing he's donated, right? Well ain't true slightest. We're pragmatic. /s Gentle gentry gentlemen know part- vaccination able resume everything normal right away? get ready in-person school next fall? Remember trump...It's Hoax...🖕🖕💩 Gravity absolutely theory. fact think theory Theory Gravity equivalent theory used describe scientific hypothesis says lot. communist animals. Bald eagles only. Nobody needs medical dictionary *not* use offensive, inaccurate language. 

**The woman competent enough create care directive.** first went down, immediately searched followed twitter wondering you’d saying this. One lighter updates gone quarantine, wife purchased lot cheese, brought smile face. (I purchased coffee toothpaste things.) items buy lot knowing we’d likely shut while? thoughts safety efficacy leading vaccines? surprised rich powerful already getting shots behind closed doors. Money always important life see changing vaccine. Looool issue kids specifically, issue community spread. /u/FreeChickenDinner mentioned, kids may parent co-morbidity. rise cases college towns spread far beyond students hurt elderly nursing homes. flu vaccine, next December we'll Covid vaccine. one Christmas.

Edit: hyperlinking That's take well, degrees this. Full normalcy day day great that's 90%+ I'm looking forward to. quite normalcy overall plans whole year, could involve things like international travel, remind I'm greedy I'm happy day day, lol  great sympathy students teachers I’m doubtful high schools return normal early next year. teachers wearing masks January 2021? certainly hope so. read somewhere drop LA cases yesterday issue one largest labs today backlogged cases look great :( seen changes people's attitudes time gone by? I've read stories people changing minds someone social circle gotten COVID. seems slow way affect change, imagine people want grieve private without ""making political."" I'm sorry deal this. lmao username.

Go back spitting synagogues ""cause Joos killed Jeesuhz"" stupid fucking Trump-humping boomer. even mask? Santa face time instead? many ways celebrate Christmas. Mind numbing stupidity. say, getting truly representative sample size harder sounds. I’d love see similar survey like repeated. that’s question hope answer here. Moderna phizer 95% effective vaccines short supply. stop gap get 50% effective. get know it’s funny, (if say that), job exposure almost nothing. 700 cases less handful job.

The community exposure killer us. weekend we’ve cut service 50% one locations don’t employees. feeling it’s like fall since probably June people get vaccinated. frontline workers definitely get first prevents deaths. Interesting! really can't say efficiency vaccine drops lot warmed injected arm? effect around 90-95% -94F only? feel better knowing making people less likely take vaccine due obviously full nonsense lie teeth regularly visible way? Well, different things proud of. Well no, don’t know correct medical term someone mind 6 month old child edit throw mask trash mask use general sickness. Exactly. saying there's chance..... anyone kind annoyed certain public health officials keep saying reach “some semblance normal” 2021? Like, get it’s going on/off switch. wish they’d actually say something like “true normal” point, even happens “some semblance normal”. long term, “some semblance normal” like, isn’t good enough.  Japan #2 product suppressing cases rather reality. Seeing 70% people willing vaccinated, vaccine 90% effective, 63% people immunity (plus chunk naturally acquired immunity). That’s lot people sustain higher R0 1, lots people run region/social circle/professions. we’ll probably need natural immunity fill chunk people see cases really fall R0 drop Talking general terms one thing, posting video could potentially violation HIPAA law designed protect patients' privacy. video showed identifying information, example, patient's name whiteboard worse, image, poster potentially healthcare facility looking fines jail time. That’s silly. 

Did “socially distance” past thirty years too, case somebody catches chicken pox doesn’t immunity? No? Good. 

Once vaccines rolling death stats collapse move on. Distancing, masks etc won’t last. Yes, unaffected. extremely busy expect delays several days. space actually runs they're probably going tell 95 year olds die home, trauma patients. amazing. Great news sure. thankful people working night day months get vaccine there. future looks great, fellas! wear masks months! I’ve hide tears prepare wives husbands lose spouses they’ve married 40,50 years. I’ve heard people’s school-aged children begging live, screaming grief realization never see parent again.

And believe next major crisis mental health one.

We families hundreds thousands people (in US, much bigger number look whole world) proper chance say goodbye. chance see loved one(s) again. explain death children, changes household stability, resulting behavioral changes children extension effects learning, development, future mental health.

We healthcare workers deal watching things extra work (I presume) lot business side hospital supportive.

And can't forget people currently sick whose loved ones *currently* sick. People actively living fear losing loved one knowing can't see person. Dreading phone ringing knowing worst news might side. Sick people also knowing may never see loved ones again.

And even **begin** address monumental often deliberate failures government address issues. federal government intercepting PPE. distributing PPE. paying healthcare workers enough. Denying existence virus. listening experts. People general deliberately defying recommendations government instructions.

There *so many* factors many emotions many people time and/or means deal process them. going difficult. want ""Hah!"" insane stupid last mile finish line littered deaths. arresting accelerating pandemic due complete lack federal leadership.

It's beyond frustrating see countries like Australia eliminated COVID-19 thanks good policy. he's pressure keep capitalist machine churning. Remember, america profits people, even progressive states. I’m saying shouldn’t lump everyone group. 

Well, huge ""understand Trump voter"" reporting past 4 years, reading watching behaviors past 4 years, understand Trump voters well enough know lot respect them. people jerks don’t want believe care virus.

Completely true, significantly larger percentage jerks areas Trump 70%+ vote. indication conditions virus first made jump humans, human behavior see inordinate risk zoonotic disease? diseases, depends method one vaccinated.

There countries (including Afghanistan Pakistan) use older oral vaccine polio. become problem vaccine prevents disease, preventing transmission; people get vaccinated still shedding virus particles [unvaccinated people getting (The injectable polio vaccines used North America Europe problem.)

When keeping eye news, one phrase might want look ""sterilizing immunity"". recently heard (I think mountain questions one Vincent Racaniello's [Q&amp;A common cold coronaviruses create sterilizing immunity natural infections. People sub legitimately told things wouldn’t go back normal 2025.  Fuck , 80 plus year olds die , say get vaccines ASAP Ambulances LA queuing four hours drop patients going read article comments guess... yes says vaccine decreases symptomatic non-symptomatic spread.  That’s great want to. makes sense. public facing, much higher exposure us techies. Thanks keeping things running! Prime example dates absurd. wouldn’t surprised see another spike infections around time vaccine made widely available. hah got downvoted comparing countries. dont that. america cant shamed.

instead use numbers. x10 cali pop new cases, voila, 400k new cases 390mil pop. total US 200k new cases 330mil pop. suspicion media amplifying particular mutation cover government’s absolutely abysmal handling Covid. someone explain vaccinated still get infected, likely severe case? vaccine built *some* immune response, enough infected first place? I'm convinced part reason we're mess due lack math/stats education. People idea what's going on. numbers mean nothing them. wrong, state average. probably live somewhere ~1% tax plus 0.25% special local tax. bad want take particular vaccine Pfizer? know petty, states, totted Trump vaccine made him. kinda distrust anything fingerprint it, aptly, anything smeared shit on. That's initial spread. follow epi curve spread prevalent 

If going cite study Kansas, assure thoroughly undressed agree this. Pfizer said 3 weeks earliest second dose, there’s maximum time. 

Id open vaccinating twice people front, everyone getting booster later 2021 available. Well yeah, comparing US state rest developed world bit silly. We're whole level complacency here. wasn’t “a vegetable.” didn’t read story shame you. yes cali good everywhere else bad  think could also warm weather. Essentially, Florida going hold summer rates spread longer (or maybe even perpetually). makes logical sense perspective one worst summer due policies, everyone experiencing warm weather. cold weather hit lot country though, may affect policies causing even places good policy colder weather spike. would imagine governments big businesses wouldn’t want Challenger shuttle issues since it’s going send people space everyone world watching. Space flight groups like flying bags money, wouldn’t want make shuttle flammable. like said, ship blows affects jobs too. big businessman wouldn’t sweep rug known risks shuttle’s design brought attention engineer working shuttle still let take don’t lose money delaying flight.

I’m trying mock you, want point silly kind thinking is. Everyone spouting “i trust science” “the scientific method works!”. think working field science exists vacuum completely naive. I’m saying anything vaccine, people’s blind trust anything long it’s backed “science” weird. People unethical, even ethical people make mistakes. * 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), vaccine manufacturers healthcare providers cannot held liable vaccine injuries federally recommended vaccines. act allows companies escape scrutiny document discovery associated litigation.
* 2005 Public Readiness Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, manufacturers, healthcare providers, government officials immune liability potential COVID-19 vaccine injuries deaths. Compensation Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program likely nope. Nothing skeptical here. /s want block you, stupid makes feel better Yeah unfortunate, donation centers area jam packed. take month get appointment - - asked what's said they've close lot centers :(  Fauci argued U.K. “kind ran around corner marathon joined last mile.” added: “They really rushed approval.” Lockdown fatigue happening roughly half country's population. Isolation fatigue happening everywhere, even people care COVID know people hang them. 

There's also certain stress level surrounding COVID general. Wear mask, easily-identifiable target anti-maskers. Refuse mask, easily-identifiable target pro-maskers. Workers suffer whatever policy employers have, there's much room personal expression there. Students parents school district says, else.

There's economic impact too, schools businesses quarantining even ""freer"" states outbreaks. Lots industries jobs hang thread, lots employed under-employed people know outlook improve herd immunity gets here. 

COVID fatigue might better, broader term use. America definitely it. first time I'd heard name. sound apt, though also disappointing pointed out. I'm boat... Kinda lost ""Avoided"" Fauci said could hit herd immunity end spring. 

- encouraging statement he’s made yet? Bells palsy Yeah year started bad day 1. colleagues enduring entirety death toll war

Not ""a"" war.

WWI Korea Vietnam Afghanistan Iraq Iraq II, Electric Boogaloo whole year World War 2 thrown sure not? - **combined**. Wat? Went straight mortgage, rest family same. gone day got it. European countries, exception Germany, haven’t handled better. Europe definitely US level regarding handling COVID. said foot bill. Start union, organize take action stand yourself

I'm expert, think timelines say normalcy return late 2021-early 2022 know guy really angsting traveling eventually felt bad it. Like, ""I want to, resist temptation!"" crying everything.

Is really hard people? Yes, Vietnam Taiwan also, agree. It’s going take longer anyone wants admit right conquer infection... least learn coexist Masks mostly protect others you, cloth masks don’t much protect others. Make N95 concerns yourself, vaccination becomes widely available people aren’t going wear No. One worker treats many many patients days. stop trolling. head hurt calculations talking about. What? I'm social outside. make small talk cashiers strangers. friends work outside work. like getting sick hate people tell smile there's nothing wrong I'm going walk around smiling like jackass simply please someone. I’ll outright say it. 
If she’s vegetable aware quality life have, like honesty much point hospital pulling stops save someone doesn’t even know exist? would treating people like rational adults make informed decisions presented consistent information. Can’t now. /s Wow year already saying stupid shit like tRump. learn fast. I'm shocked there's much outrage this. really want guy getting vaccine health care workers? guy zoom meetings stay home? state posted order people vaccinated, according states guidelines due April June. People crazy, say he's getting Imagine takes tony stark minimum 4 years make test one iron man suit. then, suits get blown needs another one quickly. creates new suit less year. Isn’t basic human instinct place lower value suit less time taken craft it? thankfully chose overt approach let us know vaccine safe amount math needed Bible school enough count platter dad hates them😂hes religious tho hes part “metal music satanic” type people Still. Even linked confirms majority people asymptomatic.

And mentioned transmission earlier surely cant correct? Yeah polls seem indicate number Americans take vaccine increasing. think lot people want ""guinea pigs"" take see others have.

If anti vaxxers want rest us. ham-handedly spamming thread. Got it. It’s pretty fuckin sad. can’t even logical discussion here. even get ostracized trying see someone else’s side understanding, definitely can’t show perspective NEVER wrong. One problem mandatory school vaccination isn’t approved children 16. 

Private businesses absolutely require employees, though. Every day don’t take vaccine another day could infecting literally thousands people. know chance getting covid high chance getting adverse reaction almost non-existent. Plus adverse reaction isn’t contagious may bad you, least you’re putting others risk deadly virus. Come man responsible 9 people I’ve know covid.

Granted family older anywhere 40s-70s. personally witnessed died furthest thing flu. hope one person changes look take little seriously. required/mandatory. Thank man. think people automatically put looney category anti-vaxers willing take new vaccination produced relatively quick. flat-earther, denial climate change, date countless well tested (sample size probably billions decades polio, measles, etc...) vaccinations. I'm nervous short term, even long-term effects any, may able identify years/decades. I'll probably end getting it, needless say I'm nervous it. everyone saying ""he wait line).... making hundreds millions billions doses vaccine, CEO producer company helps build trust product completely denial nervous. Well never, think also lie back you’ll eventually reach shore maybe right location but… Right. meetings approve approval. So, week later...! Lmfao, nice. free award today I'd fucking shoe lol destruction linear exponential? it’s linear it’s promising lights see lot people scrubs likely back office workers. hospitals putting IT, HR, Accounting, etc personnel work Covid units? Dude Im jamming slipknot right lol. Shits amazing can’t play around people sadly :( Well yeah... That's usually rush study effects years... Statistically likely die virus vaccine. obvious choice. wants people try first Bodies piling streets past 9 months. rushed. Sure didn't. Nope guys right. would put position it. say would immediately public Pham getting one first does.

An immunologists believes talking snake... top Reddit... Ahh, see Pfizer's media director dropped nice chunk change push propaganda piece. leave Dunning-Kruger afflicted redditors launch front page cheers applause.

Frankly, **last** person receive vaccine, still forced wait extra year everyone else gets theirs. Then, he's receiving injection, told: ""*Really sucks wait long essential dose medicine, huh? know company's prescription drug price-fixing schemes make tens millions Americans feel.*"" PR wise, he's screwed whether takes not. takes now, Reddit cry privilege, must nice rich, etc. take it, antivaxxers SeEitOldYoU! isnt big deal, really. Im doubling anything. telling things really - including fact go far all. understanding words? Relax follow distancing rules.

The vaccines need taken large percentage noticeable effect.

We Easter (just like Trump said, ironically)

We mask distance longer.

EU plans approval Biontech vaccine 11:53 a.m.: European Medicines Agency (EMA) wants approve corona vaccine pharmaceutical companies Biontech Pfizer earlier previously known December. ""The European Medicines Agency apparently brought forward date final approval meeting 29th 22nd,"" said CDU health expert Peter Liese. means formal approval European Commission takes place hours instead usual 67 days. “We thus accelerating process again, convinced also possible without compromising safety. also convinced EMA process better careful, ”said Liese.

Why emergency approval regular approval debate depends EMA semantics media reporting. need shoot messenger. Ex chethera*, actually 😂😂 ""nothing vaccine 10 months""


We repurposed vaccines viruses cancers clinicial trial years prior. confused about? worry, I'm listening her. 

And article say Pfizer like 164 test subjects? articles said 44k There's reason think pregnant women can't get vaccine. American college OB asking CDC/FDA offer clear guidelines recommend pregnant women option bc risk vaccine likely minimal non-existent far outweighs risks getting Covid.

I'm pregnant woman. doctor agrees, I'm getting asap. swam high school ‘chance’ would able swim 12 miles nonstop. 95+% people would die trying swim 12 miles. criticism he's getting exactly said would happen U.S senators/gov get shots early.

I got downvoted.

Damn hope recovers fully. Ozzie videos away finally believing paranormal… Yeah alright dude. I’ve working front line past 9 months. see 50-70 people per day diagnosed 80% COVID positive weekend. watched patients die. watched children kill parents. It’s horrendous. Don’t lecture better contribute pandemic. doc happened adverse reaction novel vaccine, entire clinic would fucked one us even days, yeah, it’s something absolutely think about. side effects

That's Colorado ordered them. Let's forget half second make fuck difference equipment still taken. Let's completely ignore glossing order ridiculously make much smaller point.

Let's focus fact federal government, trump himself, told states own. ordered equipment protect people, federal government went took equipment away, forcing states play politics get fraction back.

You think cost people lives? political world delusional fuck, man.  Even take it, people want believe still say fake get injected it. trust science too, that’s I’m getting it. don’t trust man. vaccine me.

The way we'll know sure antibodies produced sterilizing (*in vitro* tests suggest are) population monitoring vaccinations tracking endemic virus vaccination after. nice little shot saline cameras 1% 747 airplane 3 people flight. impossible know, especially point time, whether ""perfectly safe."" Maybe strong conjecture. There's reason whole process usually takes longer. double check believe so. reason effects vaccines appear quickly due side effects (mostly) caused immune system over-reacting vaccine. people immune system responds produces antibodies post vaccine turns back off. small fraction people immune system doesn’t shut properly produces antibodies towards body. That’s side effects show up. It’s important note effect also seen infections well.

The minute stop asking speculating , time stop learning become nothing blind believer. know there’s good chunk idiots dismissing vaccine cause, raise genuine concerns getting obliterated it. 

I said day Reddit KNOW stages testing run tandem there’s huge effort globally get vaccine going, doesn’t change last stage vaccine testing usually lasts 5 years *long term effects seen*. don’t care tests random order, once, carried standard procedure, 5 years work looking *long term* effects done year. one talks though. say that, you’re denying science don’t understand. vaccine could perfect hope god is, vaccines take. might be, acknowledged everyone. 

More time spent acknowledging people’s concerns rather calling idiots shit. Ok. again. Got human mRNA vax passed trials? Oh that’s right don’t dog rabies vax ever approved.  Agreed 100%. Man I'm cool getting probably means phrasing coached use press, vast majority people little understanding scientific method rational skepticism, difference conspiracy theory “skepticism”. pretty much everyone holds sort strong belief trust group authority, it’s easier relate people using words.

(at time, wear mask getting touch people physical distancing become habit. agree there's issue needs addressed) I've looked lot data. average adult, risks COVID vaccine already far lower getting COVID based basic statistical analysis. They've thoroughly vetted unless protected group. lot easier find tens thousands volunteers trial volunteers healthy adults. protected groups like pregnant women children inherently difficult take time, trend data supports vaccine pretty widely safe efficacious.

At end day, data quite clear: protected group, vaccine safe. can't project potential outcomes completely different hypothetical trial onto real data. real data point indication safety efficacy issues group they've tested (which covers people). p-value significant enough say without doubt found rejection null hypothesis. I've never worked office small talk happened breaks. feel way anyone who'd get vaccine publicly. see sides argument subreddit nearly every thread issue here.

If big name politician, businessman, athlete, actor, whoever else says want get vaccine camera, people get outraged preferential treatment say vaccine go saving lives instead publicity stunt. say want cut line, get accused creating skepticism wanting get vaccine, accused knowing secret harmful vaccine conspiracy.

Basically torpedo children’s normal social development see loved ones, largely sake people older average life expectancy. I’m saying shouldn’t try help people, every death (no matter cause) awful. minimize tangible harms caused favorite methods mitigation also absurd. can't imagine amount people actually facing decision trust vaccine frontlines split 50/50. huge problem wife's facility nurses, CNAs, etc wanting get vaccine quick market. general consensus wait see safe. CEO seemingly trusting vaccine enough take going cement this. 

With info I'm still leaning towards wife getting week, preliminary window, article sure hell gives doubt. 50% generous. pandemic shown incredibly stupid, ignorant, selfish people here. Read question. enables Bill Gates independently come statement such? What’s basing predictions on? ones going upset took vaccine, would show confidence work. Surpassing deaths hundred year old pandemic shocking. Absolute numbers mean nothing population USA 3 times higher people live closer together well.

Now we're talking percentage population yeah. That'd surprise since that's like 1.8 million deaths close mortality rate covid include undetected infections. point almost everyone virus mutated round 2 :( think would great thing US adopted mask-wearing person sick, like see Japan instance. I'd problem wearing mask I've got minor cold something need about. idea - post-pandemic - wearing masks time outside homes matter *is absurd*. never, ever going happen. Illegal basketball event? tv legal right? Lmfao fuck that. people seeing this? Wakeee uuuupppp state governments raise taxes wealthy. Lots multimillionaires NY FL. piece shit article. Nowhere—other headline made clicks—did say vaccine would prevent spread. None quoted scientists said article says otherwise: 

“Data vaccine phase 3 clinical trials date show vaccines lessen prevent vaccinated person developing disease, whether stop vaccinated person transmitting virus others. Whether vaccines also stop transmission unlikely known rolled general population.”

It’s unknown. baited. sleazy move guardian sure, read article. interesting times becomes less less overtly selfish go stuff there's room reasonable disagreement. 

When high risk people vaccinated hospitalization/death rates plummet, tons people feel safe party asses off. time start believing that's NY testing 2-3 times much Florida. Yes, transmission achieved airbourne droplets contact contaminated surfaces. Minks countries Greece put infected infected staff members hideous factories report infection covid 19. cats, furry friends get infected saliva, droplet transmission ie someone sneezes cat, came contact contaminated surfaces, also recommended cats let outdoors high covid 19 prevalence areas, may get infected kitties. starts fom us giving them. Yes, good skeptical extent. Science skeptical reaction must seek facts reputable sources reputable people. case trust recognized independent experts several countries also try learn.

What learned Pfizer vaccine consists lipids (fats) encapsulating mRNA simply blueprints getting cell ribosomes make inert spike proteins. immune system see intruders naturally generate antibodies eliminate thus virus - faking viral infection teaching system looks like. That's vaccinations gives us mild headaches/fevers - body thinks fighting virus.

Like vaccines, mRNA strands break disappear completely body short while. vaccines generally safe long term issues. mRNA strands simply break usage learned immune response remain weeks. 6 months trial effect long term trial.

The ingredients vial salts balance PH, water bit sucrose stabilize frozen. I'm NY I'm favor strict lockdowns. think indoor dining opened NYC way did. think people NY mostly fantastic need keeping things open possible. 

That said, there's nothing Florida's results applauded celebrated. Florida never extended period control like NY did. Throughout summer, many people die per day NY 20-30 days. There's nothing good that. clear, ""we,"" mean ""the general public,"" correct? “Cases” problem. Deaths potential overwhelm hospitals problem. problem young person problem. 

While vaccine short supply directed elderly health care workers first age groups. Different century, old stupids.  Hope vaccine beat next surge punch Wisconsin worst it.

I hope too. think, regardless government edicts mandates, seems things start getting really bad there's group people instinctively start limiting movement. 

The google movement data seems support too. download latest movement data CSV format see November December saw significant drops retail movement, transit movement, increases residential especially parks. seems like Wisconsinites spent time walking parks less time stores case loads began increase. curious there's self-regulating mechanism going might significant implications overall spread periodic limits exponential growth. Perhaps point people intuitively say ""it's dangerous congregate"" ""it's safe enough congregate"" regardless specific instructions. I'm guessing here. wrong said group. 2700+ people, group. stated still hopeful AstraZeneca actually tested people virus rather Moderna/Pfizer tested people showing symptoms apples apples.

Except among folks WANTED tentacles...  Ok easy. CEO get it. CTO get it. CMO gets shot head. dunno man. change fact get vaccine. argument he's ""cutting line"" compare amount people benefit seeing CEO stand product.

The reasoning wanting cut line complete bullshit me. matter fact, I'd rather people complain he's cutting line, complaining something fishy going on.

I'd rather people desperate get vaccinated people cautious towards it. 

I know I'm going tangent, think would general U.S population's best interest celebrities get priority vaccines condition show proof took it.

Yes, people complain celebs get priority, point we've effectively changed argument ""should get vaccine"" ""when get vaccine myself"".

In way celebs would essential workers convince general public vaccine safe get rid covid shit asap clear, although Astrazeneca *did* swab weekly, numbers included reported efficacy analyses. [Only people reported symptoms positive swab considered primary efficacy analysis included **symptomatic COVID-19** seronegative participants nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab 14 days second dose vaccine. everyone left unvaccinated 1 1000 shot dying maybe 1 50 chance serious illness, room reasonable disagreement constitutes unnecessary risk. 

Hopefully period long lived people get shots. Air stay air conditioning half minute many cycles kill enough virus make difference? 

HOw many hvac systems ramped run air extra cycles per hour, kicking raise lower temp needed, kill enough virus make worth while?

would installing rows LED lights throughout hvac expose virus air long enough kill enough viruses make worthwhile?

I read celiing light fixtures UVC &amp; fans draw air try circulate air around light slong enough kill airborne germs.

I'll still staying home making I'm out, huge step right direction. Well suggest single parents essential workers do? sub isn’t anti-science. don’t know think that. done horrendous job leadership. Remember early pandemic reports speculating actual infection rates far higher reported rates tune 8-10 times? still accurate, number people certain areas virus might approaching herd levels. Residents start with? I'm trying disrespect way tha tone kinda gets set here.woowoo..some one hotshitt Conversely, I've getting sick time ever since wife started working school. Hi! Okay there's lot unpack there, there's lot common misconceptions here.

In general, vaccine-related events essentially never appear 6-8 weeks administration; that's FDA mandated two-month follow minimum median patient. narcolepsy cases still showed within weeks months case Pandemrix; exceptionally rare took long time identify extremely rare occurence.

In addition, though mRNA vaccines previously licensed, mRNA extensively studied know lot biology. subreddit FAQ lot information point. goes point long-term issues; that's really something concerned about; FAQ goes great detail point.

Your point reinfection misleading point essentially incorrect; that's incredibly rare. also frankly know mean human-to-animal transmission that's related vaccine.

I really think would helpful read materials we've written subreddit -- may help clear incorrect information seem also help better understanding existing vaccine testing regime useful. mean stupid people holding big house parties? Hilarious think CEOs dump stock they’re news. people chose believe would never get away it, impact *entire globe* doubt mind would solved least next summer. 

It important note though current results *even better* absolute “best case scenario.” 

We threw dozens darts board hoping one would hit bullseye relatively soon. 

To *first* group vaccines prove safe also achieve efficacy far expectations (we hoping 60-80%, 90+%) honestly remarkable. 

Most experts stuck conservative estimate likely success (next summer) didn’t want set unrealistic expectations based best possible scenario, totally fair. pregnant child time got time stressor. feel pregnant moms families newborns. always already worried kids ""normal"" environment. can't imagine worrying someone, mom, dad, baby also getting COVID. fully trust vaccine we’ve seen, take first early. appreciate cutting line sentiment, I’d wager people die see Pfizer folks taking push back taking themselves. Yup pretty much answer, odds favor, 90s all.

Used mean missed, got free month prime. means... nothing. special guest star, WALT DISNEY!  Good luck getting two year old anything really. Especially don’t want to. Probably best time taking little kid traveling. even doesnt stop transmission lowering symptoms lowers R0 cause less people coughing etc.

then transmission talking internet provided forum allows people explore dumb dangerous feelings shout thoughts ether. get rewarded likes. It’s unfortunate.  that

Why talking reading? reply specifically reference hearing Mrs. Harris said. 

So thought question referencing said, televised. you’re intent ask headline, said looks like moving goalposts, I’m sure isn’t intent.  Agreed. Also 1% families. suffer they're selfish. Duh. That's really stupid. Again: we're trying save grandma, mandate calisthenics healthy diet? Removing obesity related illnesses would save people forcing COVID vaccine.

If see jogging 6:00, exercise gulags agrees follow protocol! never happen. Like created it, still wants country distribute fairly rather using position get shot immediately

Or trust vaccine yet... That’s okay sample size. little small national poll (generally they’re around thousand, think) it’s probably extremely far off. Yep. sub nuts. smart everyone believes here, lot dumbasses. “I’m anti-vax but...” oft-repeated line around here.

My positive means maybe rest us get sooner thought. someone tell “shutdown” would even mean? nyc can’t eat indoors like people south can. can’t go sports game like people south can. california they’re already “shutdown” schools retail staying open. yeah exactly would nyc “shutdown” even change?  know headline report little directly, proper journalism thing know ez, vaccines infections less deaths.

less deaths gov stop caring=lift restrictions know terrible way prevent horrific exponential spread like happened spring/summer. right asymptomatic spread. 

Every single study since reinforced science-driven conclusion. 

It’s anti-science subs like one asymptomatic spread worry because, well, people anti-science. 

Hell, today got another study backing fact asymptotic spread low. 

From: total 54 relevant studies 77 758 participants reporting household secondary transmission identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher secondary attack rates SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates increased symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%)”

So yes, trusted probably trusted whatever source you’re using come wrong conclusion asymptomatic spread. 

It’s react evidence change position. I'm kind implementation, let's look reality it, shall we?

First off, 30 seconds seem like long time, long time air stay duct. like put one two lights system good. homes businesses reach 30 seconds light saturation even every inch ductwork wired UV LEDs, would add significant complexity expense system.

That said, every little bit helps, I'm UV systems ventilation, kind wonder really going become standard, even pandemic. anywhere near bad president politicized it. doubt we'd anywhere near much denialism traditional republican like GWB office, bad president was. one situations president could created bipartisan support fight unified message fully blame Trump that. Frankly, world easily sailed reelection done that. vaccines give better inmunity vs getting sick Oh that’s good news you, from? never going reach point everyone vaccinated everyone wants vaccine. like flu regard. reason Moderna's existence originally develop vaccines cancer. saw mRNA technology way quickly make vaccines antibodies individual patients. gather progress this, mRNA technology covid existed. rude. idea vaccinating ""vectors"" new one.

Sure, long term consequences ICU treatment primarily needed keep alive. old information, repost materials last week. SIDS known cause. It’s made term means “we clue baby died”. Nothing masks, blankets, etc. 

Just like “your baby can’t stop crying don’t know why” became colic Well either nobody forces vaccine population bunch old people die result, start riding slippery slope government becomes totalitarian regime reincarnated space Hitler president people don’t vaccinate get arrested old people die result.

So don’t see negative. “Bailey’s family asked White House publicize condition,”

Uh... officials dont know vaccinated, unless go full china receive QR code validates vaccinated official fine let are, non-tech solution treat every people non vaccinated cause officials cant tell. trust CEO does, I'll give that.

I never said passing dose anyway, thanks overreaction pointing hinky CEO passing vaccine. Absolutely wrong think that's another issue gripes entire skepticism movement. 

Top scientists world actually made vaccine possible willing take questions asked record pretty much unison - enough 

Clincial trials 100 thousands people since March taken vaccine - enough

Independent organizations world - enough, still skeptical 

but CEO Obama taking it? That's deciding factor confidence vaccine?

Doesn't make rational sense. Cool CEO/Obama takes matter science and/or least people physically made vaccine possible.

**Press conference Corona Commission's first interim report**

Minister Social Affairs Lena Hallengren (S) began press conference together chairman Corona Commission, Mats Melin, telling government preparing new elderly care law.

\- regulations elderly care weak quality care uneven. robust care elderly requires robust legislation, says Hallengren.

The Minister Social Affairs believes remedy shortcomings pointed Commission.

The Commission states part Swedish strategy protect elderly failed.

Commission President Mats Melin says care elderly major structural shortcomings proved unprepared ill-equipped meet pandemic.

The Commission also considers several measures taken spring late insufficient.

\- easily said responsibility structural shortcomings shared several, still want say government governs country ultimate responsibility therefore rests government previous governments, says.

Melin also believes general spread infection society probably led large number deaths Sweden's nursing homes.

He goes measures Corona Commission wants see.

\- believe level ambition must raised elderly care. needs made clear sufficient staffing is. number hourly jobs must reduced medical competence strengthened, says Mats Melin.

They also want municipalities able hire doctors.

\- special accommodation access medical equipment oxygen nutrient solution drip good basic care provided site. reason, medical expertise must also place. Sooner later. Right what? thought troll maybe one people likes argue things know nothing about. Regardless, patience continue conversation. Good luck you. 

To health care colleagues might frustrated reading thread, take care best can. One day end, we'll face moral injury caused forced make impossible choices day day. responsible failings government institutions work for. explain spreading aerosols?They’re wearing masks, shields PPE, distanced. guess said anti-vaxxers dumb enough think taking makes unsafe opt taking it. functioning brains get first naive regulation vaccine requires.
Military thing. made vaccine optional serious immune take don’t take seriously not. Republicans killing families. They’re responsible this. totally valid suspicious new technology like that, say suspicious before, say event particular makes suspicious, probably closeted antivaxxer. guy reads like someone afraid admit they're actually vaccines, needs excuse get it. ""Big CEO bad"" type overplayed idiocy. True sure side effects would probably get back line too. would 🙃 miss hydroxychloroquine went extensive testing showed efficacy? remember anecdotal evidence might helpful spurred testing quickly showed effective. I'm remembering right, that's awful comparison use. mom also grew age polio well-vaccinated kids. believe least states one reasons local state governments want federal funding next relief package run education campaigns. Contact representative senator US tell want funding local governments educate public vaccines. hate hearing impaired? hilarious!!! wish I’d thought that. Call stubborn website's model convincing me. Nursing home patients driving death numbers, 38% deaths linked nursing homes. Unless majority want get vaccine, see reason believe death numbers decrease by, absolute latest, February.

I looked around site saw lot graphs repeated initial point deaths drop long time, actually find reasoning why. point reasoning I'd happy read it, seems like absolute worst case scenario vaccine comes nobody wants it, reliable Pew reports indicate [very older people averse what? love propaganda US. pay monthly fees lied homes. go propaganda services every Sunday families even put kids propaganda schools. 

This way. Yeah, sms bad joke. point it, useful info. Really understand point it. tell follow rekommendation found online without even putting link. think I'm starting see people think way do. fair, it’s like reinstall catheter yourself. 

However, person need ambulance get someone can? Absolutely not. That's took response mean. worked ICU 4 years non-covid days terrible. consistent death alone rough. can't imagine like working amounts hardest shift ever worked...every shift. Science bless you. It’s BS them. say unmasked? Singapore airlines still needs juicy business class money. hospitals US require bachelors science nursing, relatively difficult degree get. lot schools fail program anything B average. love getting upvoted, yet anytime someone says children, get crushed “why won’t think CHILDREN” type responses. looking forward promotion understand. probably shouldn’t going get peppermint mocha Frappuccino current surge anyway! I'm big fan China little 4k deaths. We, hand 300k. How? Simple, come house physically force quarantine. shits given rights. know can't happen rights important. Therefore determined people died Covid deaths labeled freedom fighters. Could direct documents? scanned didn’t see it, I’m sure missed it. Thanks! No. doctors give damn certain classes patients epidemic. think changed minds now?

I'd see nothing wrong teams playoffs getting vaccine healthcare/nursing home people. would talking maybe 1000 doses early Jan another 1k early Feb. Thats drop bucket.

It could also boost confidence vaccine, especially African American community given many players black. trust pharmaceutical companies make sure vaccine safe. Vaccines backed science smartest successful people world like Bill Gates. don’t trust science smart people, trust? Alex Jones? Kaaren YouTube? Come man. chastising you. Let someone else test subject unproveable logical negative. (""There harmful side effects."" unproveable.) think depends many people get vaccinated, things I've read seem indicate things open available (maybe still mask spacing restrictions) May/June, maybe we're close normal end summer.  

But gradual thing different states taking different approaches back, course. Yeah, wrong. get four weeks jail that. 

But case another screeching online outrage fest. much wish could this, seriously asking risk jobs. HIPAA joke. Even personal recording could get serious trouble due privacy laws, which, honesty, applauding upholding. 

Having said that, I'm people taking moment alone simply record thoughts feelings describing reality words share keep future. Correction: Case fatality rate USA currently 1.8%.

Correct, affect vaccination since cross-immunity coronaviruses common demonstration.   Asking people who’s news cycle dissolves reforms every 24 hours consider common sense due major event 100 years ago seems like fruitless endeavor. worked LTACH. kind people go. needed trach/venting ICU go there. Recovery long. first person US get vaccine treating condescension? sane Mississippian, year left likely permanently traumatized.

My nightmares become variations ""I'm somewhere crowded public, realize can't find mask people around wearing theirs. Someone coughing nearby."" What’s solution? Force people take sick grandparents? 

America Western Europe don’t culture taking care sick elderly. It’s different Asia extent places like Italy. worth booty call Society dictated every citizen serve military. Failure meet obligation result incarceration.

Assuming one countries actually this, OK society dictating life? Canada regular approval (though, really still going similar distribution phases US UK) words, fake news. quite clear. confirmed cases still increasing weeks semi-plateau. possible ICU admissions following still lagging behind curve week two. know 94% immunization effectiveness see advertised vaccine? lifetime failure rate. exposed virus opportunities catch it. vaccine limits opportunity virus develops. Kind like seat belt. crash car willy nilly believe seat belt make invincible. Maybe old news. guarantee mass deployment vaccines degrade handling transport?

A similar thing happened 1999 became 2000, China made airline executives board in-progress flight clock struck midnight... bet damnedest ensure systems Y2K compliant. seriously dumb I’d side comrade ! That's decision free make Hey, someone represent businesses 

/s Cool dude lemme know science eradicates disease. would personally wait years get it, means telling anyone get it. COVID 1 500 side effect - death. better taking 1 50k even one. It’s 21st century excuse clue anymore ignorance going shorten life span quite looks like. Right !? exactly complex costume  Ho! Ho! Cough...weezer ho.... likely media saturation actually playing part making people bit responsible. Less shopping trips, less guests over. comments terrible. That's Derek Lowe's blog post. paper clear. Wooosh Educated virtues wage slavery disagree you, many people follow science reason. However live, semi rural Ohio, large number people take things seriously. caused major issues school closings hospitals starting full up.

I guess nit picky language choice. simply said ""most teachers"" said word, absolutes stick like sore thumbs me.

We side friend. Exactly. should’ve ordered boatload candidates.

That exactly happened  Things open: indoor dining, bars, indoor classes almost kind, offices, movie theaters, broadway shows, fans pro sports, conventions, etc.

And impact businesses directly - sister's company works restaurants supply chain - place almost business. Anything related parties weddings can't happen. things related gyms training hanging thread. on.

Not saying things open, saying ""everything literally open"" lie. gotten many things right regarding virus next.  Ok, found it: efficacy lower (58·9% [1·0 82·9]) asymptomatic infection LD/SD cohort (and unfortunately 3·8% [−72·4 46·3] SD/SD group), results nonetheless provide hope COVID-19 vaccines might able interrupt asymptomatic transmission, although fewer data (69 cases among 6638 participants) available outcome data needed confirm.

From Lancet paper embarrassing. People still getting covid practicing social distancing. sucked.... stop projecting problems anti-maskers cause croc shit

anyone says 'never going forgive country acting like this' melodramatic sheep. Pelosi, Biden Fauci we're telling everyone wear masks start, fucking religion. people suffered 50 plus years effects Covid 19? time travelers? That's am. covid? day since March? work stress? general 2020 stress everyone else dealing with? depression? something else entirely? Oh, Belgium.... happen 10pm Belgians go bed. Back normal not? sure fact small children wearing masks delt airline

It's not, be. dealt parents traveling small children cannot wear masks reason including noncompliance. serious, probably tracker number 1000 people. then, tracking tricky accurate. alcohol* Bro, spended 21st birthday year May. Still fun, though. :D asking minimum amount deaths need restrictions lifted. worst flu year example 150 deaths day (probably much higher peak) restrictions required. correct answer somewhere 150 500 since still restrictions low point summer. knowledge not

I read reports transmission incubation, like scientist have/are working vaccines,dont access data trials measuring transmission disputes reports link, know reason cancel ""the new normal""

more importantly, anti vaccine folk might numerous enough still risk overloading icu capacity long genuine access vaccines americans nation man babies. “The health safety employees customers highest priority, multi-layered set policies, including mandating everyone onboard two older wears mask. procedures backed guidance CDC partners Cleveland Clinic, they’re also consistent across every major airline. somebody going get charged reckless endangerment, something along lines? Wear sensor, bigot USA, explicit list ""rights"", violations 1st, 4th, 5th amendments challenged, minimum. inverting concept rights giving liberty government. question whether government violating _its_ rights. Incrementalism precedence eroding threatening existing rights. Crisis rights risk. rhetoric trite. gave exhaustive answer 

You seem aggressive miserable. calm change approach want heard people don’t agree you. People haven’t changed behaviors. relaxation fear. large portion population hasn’t changed behavior all. chunk may hit high percentage infections. Don’t forget pockets population density. state basically lower threshold herd immunity. may true immunity enough really slow spread down. I've got two year old. wears mask. fight it. piece clothing put go outside. transcribed video link nothing better way Christian’s Catholics, Muslims follow regional directives main directive either. many sects Islam, yeah, regional ones differ greater influence. 

Catholics follow mostly Vatican directive Christian’s follow Vatican “If don’t study mistakes future, we’re doomed repeat first time” -Ken  interesting question totally unqualified answer. However, understanding first shot unlikely become COVID-19+ hopefully moot question. temptation forbidden fruit! wanted save lives, I’d wait. It’s like limiting factor antivaxxers right now. becomes factor, I’d publicize getting vaccine. say ""The Narrator:""! initial amount getting 100m?  Good. 
""We've flown summer."" bunch dicks. Full Jack King party. Remember, posters subreddit kept yapping ""we may never vaccine"" ""infection confer herd immunity"" humanity fucked rest eternity, might well kill ourselves, etc. etc.
A huge FUCK YOU! doomsayers. remember baboon Trump saying get it. assessment behaviour causing risk others actually discrimination? 
Is person behaviour concern? work live events worker here. Everything literally open. entire industry everything related still completely shut down. Career 10+ years burnt ground.

As opposed punishing citizens super rich? weekend trip get-together. Dying spider bite--do links back claim? I'd believe stranger Reddit ya know? Facts. 

Also resultant issues spider bite great. Ask know. 

A parent toddler accept risks shark attack put child water. mitigate. swim flags, keep eye kids. avoid dangers wherever possible. That’s one little boy. Flawed logic. difficult depending child. 8500 people day die US. Every day whatever reason. covid. covid. logic population Indianapolis dies every 100 days. think know history don’t 

Potato long? 2022 mean *rim job*? internet put world’s information fingertips. made knowledge completely equitable.

But never taught people tell difference truth lie. dumber 100 years ago. AZ published peer reviews, Pfizer Moderna yet. say transparent think media one causing noise.

The fact tested everyone trial weekly helped, gave probably realistic efficacy rate. promising thing one got seriously ill point hospitalised. Huge!

Do know Pfizer/Moderna definitely test weekly? weird especially know asymptotic cases know spread on. Where'd see quotes? never claimed baby wear mask.

I said kill them. condition stock market indication well economy going things vast majority people. indicates much money already rich people continuing make. frankly many problems list here, kind time. say mask kill them? top shot caller business producing vaccine 'admits' could get everybody else?

*Surprised pikachu mean least travel time get covid test. ridiculous 😂 Thank this. mother 5 year old, totally agree (but unpopular opinion among parents). Great News..

Thank much sir updates 

Atleast hope vaccine coming .

Also I'm sure hard toddlers like mom would put fear god us even pretended like going take mask giving us 'the Look'. Honestly, unless asthmatic underlying health issues might put risk, understand would take vaccine. thing. mom cancer. get treatments die. course gets COVID would probably die.

Before COVID, dad went clinic moral support. goes alone.

Before COVID, would visit every then. talk phone.

COVID-19 helping her. It’s hard get informed actually. Somewhat misleading title. Article talks homes someone already covid positive, home general. understatement millenia Hypothetically visit baby’s grandparents? unnecessary you? lines blur me. trivial me. I’m saying I’d - people different ideas need sustain well being. several friends took quarantine seriously traveled visit loved ones several months it. couldn’t anymore. I’m done judging. Vaccines don’t kill virus. teach cells identify basically neutralize virus. conceivably, could get infected, get sick, still able spread virus someone hasn’t vaccinated. Uh get facts correct spewing bullshit. 45-50% healthcare workers want take it. 🤡 Unmmm those? justify want reelected.

You vaccinate everyone deaths hospitalizations fall cliff. 65+ croud vaccinated cases mild. [IMHE](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/briefing_South-Dakota_20201210.pdf) estimates South Dakota's infection rate 29% December 7th. Approaching vaccine caution would mean getting many people vaccine soon possible.

A better phrase describing vaccine recklessness. Sure, society choosing prioritize populations workforce (nursing homes, elderly, prison congregate setting populations, etc.) means economic impact last regular people start getting vaccinated feel safe engage economy wanna go convention, almost costume contest win. K Ah, right, mixed up. still, considered medical worker since he's charge company making vaccines. Thatta boy! real curve starts. way take comment, capital /S Dude! need survive! get mine sick? It’s tribalism, nothing more.

Covid brought judgmental person everyone. Probably side effect less socialization. surprising since nurses large HMO worked get regular flu vaccine. worked non p.t facing clerical role. STILL thevsamebtestscand shots did. Every year, flu shot nurses came building. got yourvfreevsho5band lit5le pinkmsticker put badge. pink sticker meant wore mask October March.

I'm used 'in network' meaning insurance network terrifying, hospital network makes sense. thing Trump famously misinterpreted going injecting UV rays bloodstream something, much embarrassment scientific advisor? shows they've known potential half dozen months  ? didn’t? 

Wiiiiiiiiink family kids, study home, becomes hard.  Maybe I’m missing something isn’t new, it’s well documented female study patients within specific age range pregnancy test. Russia accused spreading anti-vax propaganda US. It’s nice vaccine, world needs start something Russia. That's fantastic news! remember said that? you’re looking forward it’s dumb wasteful. enjoy crap that.  Two things 
1) asthma proven AAAAI effect terms Covid risks.
2) really think guy generous? Jesus need learn think critically, Pfizer one disgraceful histories part it. kindness, isn’t taking it. Yup! Frosted flake. Keep going...I'm close... hospital workers? like see ya later chump close boarder **Social media use increases belief COVID-19 misinformation** 

 **Social media use increases belief misinformation** 

If one good thing comes misinformation everywhere everything COVID finally made understand that. Watch Social Dilemma Netflix great easy imagine. think cemetary. Lmao, k. Fruit loop. Isn’t newsom also hypocrite telling everyone stay home meanwhile going parties fancy restaurants? Kinda screws credibility shit like that. Japan South Korea seeing record spikes told everybody handled like champ except America. reason getting new update posts sub cases/deaths? system finally collapsed Lol wut? I’m sure think you’re making excellent points lolll  Uh yeah get faster production increases, slow months. Good luck, take good care yourself. used think too. many trials already showing okay, approvals got globally, damage seen COVID, I’ve changed mind wanting vaccine ASAP. risk get COVID get vaccine, I’m heathy young. feel gross vaccine couple days effect - well sucks won’t potentially kill someone, whereas getting COVID unknowingly spreading can.

Also, depending situation, may much public vaccine already belt even becomes available you. use comes extra investigation decide you’re confident taking soon can. Nah I’m fun. 

Cheerio! sound pretty selfish wanting lockdown millions people safety. One dose nothing compared millions doses sold worldwide. 

Idk feel this. Like us, want over, vaccine would help us get CEO stand product, think I'd able recommend close ones.. Cool story bro. Schadenfreude knowing idiots like live life hard mode delicious. VaCcInE DoNt CaRe oThErS 

🤣 want get tracked government!

/s Neither really. I'm medical professional, effectiveness like rate symptomatic vaccinated people compared symptomatic unvaccinated people. 

Vaccine effectiveness calculated using formula (U - V)/U x 100. U number symptomatic unvaccinated (placebo) people V number symptomatic vaccinated people. give half tests placebo half vaccine, certain amount (let's say 300 people simplicity) come back show positive covid test symptoms, figure 200 people symptoms unvaccinated, 100 people symptoms vaccinated. get (200-100)/200 = 100/200 = 0.5, multiplied 100 making 50% effective.

There's lot less 1 2 chance become symptomatic without vaccine, relative reduction symptomatic people comparing vaccinated unvaccinated what's expressed effectiveness figure. Thankfully. Imagine *wanting* kill people they’re informed are. people wonder Germans able convinced become nazis... (access denied

(My nana calls Grandma's famous sauce, added yeet sounds cooler) also several different long term effects, ranging likening mild cold something actually crippling. otherwise healthy citizens cannot access vaccine healthcare workers medically fragile folks do, would considered cutting line someone get vaccine sooner simply status and/or wealth? Article presents clear case ""well shit Sherlock."" still 1/3 every drug passed fda turns previously unknown harmful effects, mention first mrna vaccine dont know long term effects. elderly vulnerable means get it, point fit 20 year old getting know 0 chance dying covid...its jut unnecessary risk statistical impossibility ill pass, wont want find 10 years im unfertile missed window two weeks ain't gonna cut it. Univerdal mask wearing still beneficial, though. would picked apart matter decision, personally think right move. celebrities past presidents publicly receive vaccine ease fears. Let logistics work stay lane. really doubt we’ll socially distanced 2022, guess certain small features pandemic life stay many years forever. mask mandate wouldn’t surprised lot people kept wearing like East Asia. Flights restaurants run lower capacities normal, Zoom calls work home convenient, etc. there’s way people stay put another year month. Even disciplined countries relaxing lot rules last summer. can't make people happy. ones think save convinced otherwise. jesus came wrote new psalm ""take fucking vaccine morons""

The thing science is: believe single person. 30.000 people enough gouvernemts approving one another nothing can.

He would take people would cry rich getting first. save take CEO decent thing, risk, fucking moron already took it, he’s saying show. want stop avoiding family might get sick like 'em. Wishing death upon stupid makes even worse. People way forgiving empathic! Cause Covid didn’t make sick got it. trust immune system. said plenty vaccines take, don’t need one done online poll whether get vaccine, submit people. say took side either way.

The fact matter though, he's afraid take vaccine otherwise CEO pharmaceutical company. Even motivated purely money, make sense public vaccine risk would get company sued, would probably ruin company. True. I’m npc :) Went right over, didn’t it? HCD! \- Georgia  want able party son’s first birthday. born 3 days state’s lockdown late March, family met twice. milestones missed first Christmas especially hard. want able celebrate family. people wary vaccine. Like honestly, see that? Take blinders lady r/rimjob_steve Sure, already see people thread doubting vaccine due announcement. People give shit thinks, read headline draw own, flawed conclusions. I've asked ""two-day shipping"" means past, never is.

They've told means package shipped within two days, arrives within two days. Ha. I'll bet J&amp;j/Jansen gets faster results massive spike cases globally. Plus reduced trial capacity 20K. get solid signal them, we'll bring virus knees easily summer. dunno we're divided. There's people sense all. there's morons. X doubt seems like intentions behind action lost modern social justice. Seriously wish could throw overly emotional driven people damn volcano.

Yes, yes, I'm aware that's likely people somebody aspergers fucking baffle me.

What's hard looking data? would even trust emotions types things? article covers 30% figure, severe disability figure you’re mentioning? article highlights prevalence fatigue. link wrong one? Well valid argument made. they're confident long term safety vaccine (which main controversy taking vaccine), take it. Nothing lost takes much gained. didn't, uncertainty.

The long term safety vaccine looked all. argument FDA CDC approved it, research basis make absolutely certain claims indeed zero long term effects. Hell, leave income shutdown ends.  Vaccine isn’t FDA Approved , FDA issued EUA (Emergency use authorization companies responsible adverse reactions shit die. People need stop acting like FDA approved course people skeptical. make point multiple ways. npc programming sophisticated.  immunity eventually disappear

Same vaccine curiosity considered thought home private dining experiences? Date night cooking demo class? charge 100+ head, easily, pick choose environments you’re willing go :) ask I’ve thought several times husband haven’t found He's hesitant take though. He's eager take time comes telling CEO company able switch syringes himself? incapable bribing one two people who'd know? defenestrate them?  Well US dosage Pfizer Moderna 100 million each. 

Not enough, far better was. Yah, imagine CEO flu vaccine company came announced get vaccinated unknown later date wanted dose go someone else. really bad look massively harm good. directly expose test subjects COVID, let go days?

The latter's I've heard, that's case, why're assuming 8 would get infected, 162 avoided it?

Also, still assume *did* contract heightened resistance? ones going upset took vaccine

Better read numbers instead listening BS politicians say. Haha 

I think Window viruses work twitch livestreams always free watch, hell, *I* pay *them* watch shit rather risk taking vaccine even CEO scared taking 

The CEO ""afraid"" take it. waiting line like every sane person. [Why asking commenter bother vaccinate care 🤣🤣🤣 Damn, good luck guys, hope everything works out. took vaccine 2 days ago so, everything fine far nothing happened regards side effects hope people go even bit hesitant Really? live that's say local news.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* can't even imagine long term health consequences people able get proper ICU treatment due crowding. average, 900,000 million. Positivity rate around 3%. People ARGUED kids clothed riding car seat? 
“Think dumb average person is. think half population even dumber” something like that. 

I’ve started looking peoples’ post history replying them. 
It hard times, sometimes fail, adhere rule (and regret later). 

Keep following science engaging critical thinking! know already said risk group. writing posts blind? would assume yes (I'm getting wednesday guidelines said get positive covid diagnosis last 4 weeks only, longer think able get it), one nursing home patients Covid back may, survived caught last month died, reinfection definitely thing! Meanwhile I'm home health field nurse whose entire office staff infected one person came work asymptomatic, ask director would provided vaccine know. corporate clearly even talked directors yet.  Singapore top 10%, US bottom 10% accurate (at least deaths per capita). think people downvoted dont want see truth So, care anyone yourself? said fall approach “some form normality”. mean still need wear mask times? so, that’s true normality.

If means “live life normally mask you’re out” that’s normal enough me. Eventually Singaporeans get line knowing vaccine. He's probably busy selling stock #HailTheMoon mentioned elsewhere well: though likely true based past experience vaccinations, data yet definitively showing humans. SG one best, along Taiwan, Vietnam Thailand.

For reason region world. got text NYU today. says please schedule they'll let us know general public possible, seem scientific community saying. virus new may find time right. I'm certainly taking unnecessary risks, hope others covid think they're invincible. Like said, expert.

I believe second first. believe surplus second. vaccine stored extremely low temperature. neighborhood pharmacy probably suitable freezer. probably used dry ice distribute pharmacy. someone misses shot would want collect back. Would want vaccine shot waited day pharmacy, recollected, redistributed? would assume shot would wasted. double shot seems guarantee shameful amount waste.

From heard, people get vaccine unpleasant day (but worth immunized). Many people would decline second shot think one shot immunity good enough.

It going level 1 clusterfuck, nonetheless improvement current situation. work Philips Samsung? Also worth keeping mind people answer survey doesn’t always mirror actually do. But, suppose could go either way. That's insane. Thankfully health officials recommending masks children age 12. Skeptical residents workers balking getting shots.

I would consider kicking people removing positions that's case.  I'm another parent reddit reading news, yeah, vaccine standpoint, looks way.

They *are* experimenting several states dc covid testing schools. So, proves effective reducing outbreaks, schools may reopen vaccine available. mean, Russia literally defenestrated doctors telling truths like coronavirus country, think bit skepticism appropriate sure relevant? without vaccination likely still spread virus. live cannot force anyone vaccinate going made mandatory.

Here's one experience wife's company, run hundred SNFs across multiple states seeing large number people unwilling vaccinate. think we'll still ultimately choose vaccinate I'd lying say guy refusing vaccinate gives pause. Kind of? probably company long without CEO. hand though, he's actual *work*. Pfizer exist, maybe different company would re-hire workers, buy ex-company's stuff, continue work doing. live Wisconsin we’re boat. anything, people gotten even lax everything. restrictions mask wearing anywhere stores. Bars restaurants packed full weekends. shown could 3-24x likely reported numbers. even 3x reported numbers (400k), that’s well 1mil people. That’s lot fucking people considering pop around 5 mil. I’m using low end 3 too, knows actual number studies swayed Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca. good scientific practices, showed willingness pause trials investigate potential complications (thankfully none vaccine related), results speak themselves. Like said, average adult, statistical analysis Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca trials point significantly lower risk taking vaccine getting COVID.

Since protected group, understandable reasonable apprehensive without data. would wait data comes sure situation. average healthy adult though feel concern getting vaccine. low-risk protects others able get vaccine whatever reason, protects themselves. like many claim know much long term implications vaccine (we actually pretty good idea, based know mechanics vaccine, digress), *still* know long term implications getting COVID. Even healthy adults known hit hard it, still know exactly pattern risk aside old people immunocompromised. recent studies point genetics factor, need keep studying collecting data understand risk level actually is. potential long-term effects COVID much worse risky potential long term effects vaccine. way could possibly think that?  Plus ton healthy young people got killed war many others disabled damaged. call idiot herd immunity. friend who's ER doctor Toronto, another surgeon Phoenix. asking respective hospitals think vaccine said everyone satisfied safety profile vaccines front line get them. 

On margin, guy Toronto seemed think even greater enthusiasm it, surprise me. whole ""the government lying get us!"" conspiratorial strand significantly less pronounced Canadian culture U.S. think point know even less long term issues result getting Covid That’s going happen everyone vaccinated. fewer deaths per day doesn’t mean virus become less dangerous. unvaccinated person catches virus summer still going much higher risk dying caught flu. depends state. 20 states pledged vaccinate high risk/health care workers/essential workers first. 

However, quick google search pull state's vaccination plan. Lord knows days ago. 

You also take look figure place line. pretty damn dumb tbh. I'm still getting vaccine months, see move like completely flipping loads people there.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Yeah, sure that's reason Yes are. trust governments experts best public, conspire doubt decision. conspiracy shits year insane tbh.

In kids kindergarten tested 24 kids 12 adults student (20yrs) tested positive working 2days. None tests came back positive, course none wore masks. political leaders, though. medical experts. KNEW.

I'm used politicians liars. whole new kind fucked never imaged. remarkable place, 3 times past years.

The downside extremely hot humid climate. Yeah 2 year olds vary much. 24 month old different 35 month old, they're 2. can't reason young 2 year old way almost 3 year old. kid able wear mask short outings 2.5, doubt would keep whole flight, especially bored agitated like plane passengers are. Lmfao I’m still gonna get vaccine gotta admit little concerning lol long going keep listening public health experts? people never listened, people gave now, others give get shot. Doesnt change saying, right saying masks distancing probably still recommended second half 2021. quote article...no one happy it. guess maybe apparent everyone, SIDS stands ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"". thing increases risk SIDS, means increases risk death. Bet idea. not... must make so. Yet vaccinations nursing homes delayed, start earlier December 21, [misunderstanding CVS, Pfizer, Department Health Human gaining consent. point see level PETA Well, no. get aircraft right now. actually leave house like week get necessities. think ready see this.

Reports UK tens thousands vaccinated last week.

Being optimistic would put 190k max, rate would take 105 weeks 2 years give 20million people one dose.

Let's hope gets faster, numbers published. MCO, theme parks, beaches, everything open.

Aren’t worried missing chance vaccine though? [look many denialist alt right subs post mention fact deleted huge swathes posts summer subreddit, almost like going back covering tracks. 52 people.... amateurs.... long term effects COVID would meaningless person.

The long term effects covid pandemic include poverty whole host social emotional issues extend beyond disease symptoms. 

Getting vaccine important many reasons. words toxin already picked you. might important detail mention. rest case. Repeat customers? Show proof please. clear: likely based past experience vaccines, know definitively true humans. buffet That's country do/will do.

If approved FDA EMA (EU version FDA), approved countries. Statistical anomaly?? There’s foundation argument? Yes, let’s open flood gates, it’s unlikely anyone “important” die. fewwww 27 year olds leaving behind families. 

You know what? Shame people developing depression things caused due “isolation”. least they’re 6 feet under. least children don’t grow without dad. grandma. grandpa. uncle. aunt. 

I’m sorry “anomalies” aren’t sufficient doesn’t fit bias. statistics literally say we’re experiencing deadliest days United States ever experienced.. CONSISTENTLY. awful days back-to-back. top that, that’s isolation implemented. That’s social distancing. That’s mask mandates. people taking precautions nation never before. imagine weren’t taking precautions. Imagine numbers. 

To top off, people studied field entire lives they’re saying would devastating didn’t take precautions. could imagine thinking OPINION matters experts. That’s another level self-centeredness.  right, 40%~ Americans get vaccinated wear masks are. reasons we're still skyrocketing numbers past most, countries months straight. exact reasons eviction problem infinitely bigger be. 

I ain't conflating shit already connected. Well, guess closing schools quite high price pay society. scientist generally searching truth aware search involves uncertainty, politicians generally searching support large parts population general quite limited understanding scientific process. I'm Texas informed this. 800 pound gorilla sit?

Anywhere fucking wants. Thank commenting! flu shot legally required? healthy young adult mean. taking chance either way. Taking vaccine much, much better gamble. home state Wisconsin, people age 80 make less 2% population account less 5% cases.

They account almost 25% hospitalizations 50% deaths state.

Expand age 70 around 8.5% population (roughly 490K). age 70 persons account less 10% cases.This cohort, 70+, accounts roughly 45% hospitalizations, almost 80% deaths.

End Q1 2021 look much much better. Right well never able prove 100% safe forever. Unless willing wait 30 years results. Every vaccine ever approved FDA far safe disease vaccinating against.

So best. far best experts think safe short-term long-term. think know better experts?

We know virus safe either short-term long-term. going choose vaccine virus? importantly choose get vaccine choosing dangerous everyone else gotten vaccine yet. anti-science also asshole. First, say post title says (but yet mods still allowed it)

Second, listen Gates say, merits earlier things mentioned rather ""smart guy"". Recall fellow ""smart guy"" Bill Nye said would two years would vaccine. /r/gatekeeping essentially bad cold point.

No, it’s still hell lot deadlier even flu age groups besides young children. mindset you’re promoting going get people killed reason. home 0% Covid rate isnt ceo company made it.
Biontech made (only) ceo company distributes it.

But either way , chooses „skip line“ not, people would blame him. reasons See skipping line would blamed one.

And since people refusing take isnt Problem right now(atm producing enought/more distributing is)he probably made right Choice. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ABC poll released today 80%. average people really give much care CEO Pfizer does? feel like stronger celebrities former presidents take it. know certainly care I'm n one. tad weird get high priority anyway.

It makes difference healthcare worker he's taking hundreds people interact with. He's putting people risk casting doubt anything ask me

He's casting doubt. He's follow guidelines exactly should. He's ""afraid"" irresponsible wrong say so. can't deny point, take look thread people doubts (which find entirely reasonable).

I find doubts even remotely reasonable. vaccine safe effective. don’t think it’s weird want justice fairness. It’s going save lives whoever gets it, elderly risk taken care of, don’t care logical choice is. Deaths 40 rare I’d rather people haven’t selfish assholes get rather forcing people killing others actions even save us. won’t take anyway doesn’t matter. don’t give crap more. don’t want die. someone die them, us. good - victory lap.

Frankly, I'm surprised rolled everywhere effective is. made pretty clear. personally disagree, that's all. ;) I'm sure could get private care home, even people find out, like said vaccine 100% effective, he's old, so.. can't wait industry come back.. able find new job.

Yeah animal turds shouldn’t equal us animals! missing - haven’t around 9,000-11,000 cases day? I’m considering control. elementary school 3 reported cases one week. 

We aren’t better. It’s states bad now. mRNA vaccine took two days develop, even new variant problem (it’s not) wouldn’t one long. It’s almost like _want_ make vaccine useless. certainly time evaluate long term consequences including long term effectivity. risk/reward standpoint, we're seeing lot long term effects actual virus already, I'm electing bet vaccine. However, respect right chose differently. too, get months.

Also, like last person earth get smart phone.  Anyone expresses skepticism gets downvotes around here. It’s pity naive masses are. germany get vaccine january all. Although got invented country. I'm quite surprised. upset surprised.

As far know get rolled january masses, elite. takes time. approximately 20 million doses get january... population 83 millions sad.

Beat saw post man complaining vaccine untrustworthy said side effects temporary manufactured less year. said won’t take doesn’t know what’s it. 

Well think “I’d rather issues go away dead.”

My response think get better soon.  literally day one vaccine. six months ago, respectable news sources saying would minimum 18 months vaccine, optimistic case. recently \*Friday\* widespread stories president putting political pressure FDA drugmakers approve vaccine faster.  between, people closely following news Pfizer's data post-election circus still dominating news.

In next sixty days, 20-50 million people get vaccine, depending Moderna approvals logistics. people know someone got it. people's doctor get it.

At time, next forty five days worst entire pandemic terms deaths per day, potentially April-in-NYC level meltdowns cities across country.

Those two things together push lot people edge. even going 53 60% acceptance may get us close enough \~70% herd immunity threshold many locales adding infection-acquired immunity Orange County worst could well true, one vaccine basically needle haystack; going change much global scale. He's putting people risk casting doubt anything ask me, long term would beneficial actually took it.

And can't deny point, take look thread people doubts (which find entirely reasonable). Approval FDA isn’t enough trust you? current death rate half July's death rate, even gets halved again, go ""1 single death much"" He's neither elderly frontline worker. easy! 

All fire woman keeping numbers honest. deleted reply below, already wrote out, is:

It absolutely needs said. Sometimes make sacrifices life avoid massive catastrophes. Children seeing family members live outside home damaging worth potentially sacrificing lives others. months matter virus pandemic. 

It's extremely entitled selfish take. sacrificing. I've lost three family members able mourn properly, see living family, funerals them. really wanting children see grandparents poor reason break guidelines, also might lead deaths beloved grandparents.  sounds Pfizhy...  traced back France. wife already locked Valentine's day That's I'm saying.

ademas, creo que se entiende que la intencion es para solo escritura, ya el que lo hace por hablarlo es ir la extra mile fall asleep time. nap frequently. put baby plane even stroller outside put mask baby, baby falls asleep, strolling around park, baby absolutely could die SIDS.

I Here!! studies. There's data now. People like team developing models gauge reinfection determine booster vaccines may need given pandemic come end. 

You see data ""reported"" probable reinfections here: vs ""confirmed"" Funny many stupid redditors think anyone who’s skeptical vaccine dumb conspiracy theorist. guys bunch inbreds Rock. Updated numbers in.... and....still zero! anti-vaxxers think way do? Brah he’s literally ceo company created revolutionary vaccine record braking time amid pandemic— nah he’s rich doesn’t get use vaccine. fishy Sadly, agree this. end day, everything $$$ agree, seem like Florida bad politics would believe. I'm pretty sure US way worse Canada. family none want come even know snow birds thinking. We're wishing could escape Canada, know anyone would want come here! still operating. operating normal. big issue receiving treatment. right much preventative work skipped. cases missed. pop ugly heads up. Yup, apolitical coworkers hesitant get developed fast. I’m like give me, I’ll guinea pig you! it? June late spring/early summer They're important us. Everything reflects truth.  OC relatives still think it’s hoax Say good bye plastic item room too. he’s afraid drink kool-aid. new administration everyone seems think vaccines previous administration fine. moron Yeah, elective mean lot things. Anything important preventative screenings finally mole removed. see commercials years now....""Did get Covid 19 Vaccine? entitled settlement....."" millions millions dollars probably helps giving shit since afford hide sex dungeon rich-people orgies (ala eyes wide shut) rest population sorts tho...  Yes dad went place Florida. numbers county Toronto far off. given fact he's going stay hell away people whether he's Canada Florida, see deal shit weather next five months. million sources dirty history, however lot stuff unfortunately covered never see light day. downvotes propaganda shills however, confirm I'm saying 100% true. say ""did see coming"" I'm refering january. Covid takes time spread society. probably spreads younger populations first, elderly/risk groups get infected. takes 3-4 weeks people die. countries realised people dying spread already really bad.

Of course many lives could saved people took covid seriously early february. seem handle good example. point though covid slow virus. started see covid spread february, virus already spreading. We´re always multiple steps behind covid. yet, taking single vaccine cause lot people take vaccine becomes available. 

Why? develop vaccine contact lot people. He's even epidemiologist. 

People would less likely trust vaccine pharma executives care others violate ethics guidelines. Like said, see people throwing doubt vaccine *in thread* 

They're people absolutely every thread. people doubting vaccines give single shit data. 

But they'll trust pharma executive? Articles like affirm belief vaccine unsafe.

The article affirm all, fact goes way opposite. didn’t apply unemployment even though could fit six months. Job seasonal farm hand. **scientist** friends (many PhDs and/or GRADUATED PhDs) believe vavcine tested all, find insane.

Some saying done research whatsoever what's going vaccine developments and/or simply interested developments. However, that's pretty intense gutsy conclusion come about. article’s theory would seem align one: linked article also addresses issue adaptation humans, also contains link thesis.

I obviously can’t vouch article’s veracity. It’s interesting however. Thanks post. take vaccine another rich person getting unequal treatment. don’t rich person using poor Petri dish. so? Virus-growth-wise, yes, they're terribly also. people countries universal healthcare avoiding doctors expenses associated crappy private insurance? future? Americans going deal long-term organ damage vascular damage current US healthcare system? US economy get last nail coffin people stop buying consumer goods afford $12/hour income barely pay dialysis treatments, new medications, oxygen tanks. Yeah wasn’t would something else, crazy stupid people don’t think, animal reactions - people present investigate whatever hypothesis like good luck them. reasonable suspicion set events course someone investigate. 

However, publishing analysis step duties rigour obligations transparency attached - especially coming established scientist. linked article meet these, owing lack detail platform published. 

The fact established scientist authoring makes unreliable would capability, training access information able produce much in-depth work (which already conducted exact topic).

In case 'data dead end', hypothesis abandoned. published ongoing work topic (of higher standard linked article). far notion SARS-CoV-2 man made get real support evidence, notion arose anywhere else China doesn't. Thank making people trust vaccine, sir. DNA. doctors engineers family don’t practice. want wedding already got postponed. got legally married 3 people. able celebrate family friends:(  Nah, people working front line creating distributing vaccine essential. 

The guy sits behind desk home Zoom call telling people essential, he's higher chain. wasn’t asympomatic. number looking 4% Meh. think people hopeful vaccine work. hopeful too. I’ve also front lines government hospitals literally changing sometimes multiple times daily ‘safe’ us truly... it’s based have. N-95’s use good one time use think 3 hours?.... used one weeks. Cant tell sure long good bc 3-M main manufacturer removed guidelines pandemic hit. major majority seen flipping blatant disrespect safety guidelines front lines... yet affects everyone. 

I worked Dallas Ebola sh*t told us ridiculous. CDC literally makes shit up. 

Suuuuuure let’s open another ICU... awesome critical care! NOT! aren’t getting trained nurses that. Yes learn good luck you’re first patients bc short staffed training... isn’t happening. We’ve always short staffed y’all truly seeing yet truly seeing it. haven’t used stethoscope WHOLE career. 

Also hear Covid. Man... wish Covid. city surpassed murder rate last year July, car accidents, crimes, oh wait regular sick people. literally shaking trauma bay trying cry weekend. 

I took care sickest non Covid patient ever weekend opened prepared ready run, expecting die. wasn’t even stressful day. I’ve sat many families year mourn loved ones body. Covid. 

The thank you’s gone. ‘perks’ gone (the original discounts essential). anger quarantined high. Yet countries literally living regular MONTHSSSSSSSSSS.

So don’t mind me, tireless thankless butt working 48-72 hours night waiting people come in. work exhausted coworkers try save you. Ahhhhh what’s hazard pay get shit everyday? 

Yes I’m bitter. rightfully so.

Mask up. Stay home. Stop listening doctors last 50 years tried get couch... stay it! lots concerns go away vaccine phase 3 clinical trials date show vaccines lessen prevent vaccinated person developing disease, **but whether stop vaccinated person transmitting virus others. Whether vaccines also stop transmission unlikely known rolled general tell, there's chance vaccinated people going keep spreading disease asymptomatically. respond vaccination bad raw-dogging life exposed everyone else's covid. refuse vaccination could still go full covid. long term repercussions virus outside initial phase maybe vaccination help that. world CEO company DESIGNED FIRST VACCINE CORONAVIRUS NEEDS DISTRIBUTE LEADERSHIP high priority? Bad wrongthink guess Sounds terrible. /s

Most google peeps families kids. wants guinea pigs first? There’s plenty articles long term affects though.

And damage isn’t obvious- enlarged hearts organ damage among them, things might realize problem specifically look it. 9000 cases considered great? rest country outside Hawaii Vermont must horrible. Remember cry: ""we're testing much."" mean let's stop labeling everything conspiracy think critically moment. CEO taken vaccine, (and sure couldve spared Injections staff), certainly beg question.... true selfless hero trying times (which somewhat doubtful big pharma CEO, especially Pfizer....) truly want wait longer see vaccine issues larger sample sizes? think latter much likely doesnt mean vaccine fact going give anyone issues since may undesired side effects, worse, whatever timescale arbitrarily pick... maybe CEO waiting out. Honestly CEO shouldve lied, said took it. one would've known it'll add fuel fire. he's needy exposed ton people way healthcare workers are. Every healthcare worker gets vaccinated dozens cases 

And yet, taking single vaccine cause lot people take vaccine becomes available. Like said, see people throwing doubt vaccine *in thread* cause announcement. imagine many people reality take it. data demonstrates confidence product.

The people doubting vaccines give single shit data. 


The populace large scientists. care data-sets peer reviewed reports. care perception product. plenty people wary vaccine due ""short time took approve vaccine,"" plenty psuedo-scientific claims rushing vaccine vaccine ""normally take 4-8 years develop."" Articles like affirm belief vaccine unsafe. Absolutely said nothing like that. I'm saying parts country might periodic restrictions control spread needed vaccine itself. Glad could help change mind :)

If get updates let know. good god. people lockdowns, it’s true love. I’m glad found ❤️

In seriousness though, adults moment understand although lockdowns slow spread, factors besides Covid leaders consider? (dare say swear word... economy). impression money nothing businesses rebuilt we’re healthy frankly.. you’re dead wrong that. 

Obviously people cowards downvote without response. Explain think it’s responsible keep shutting without financial support. say ‘bUt aMeRicA NeVer ShUtDown’ stop.. stop. People hurting, people lost everything. can’t shut fully couldn’t ship product around world one would make food order home every night. shut down, may ‘wuhan style’ that’s gets dicks hard.. enough fuck us years. America now. Full idiots. Won’t True, decision delay shot “wait turn” own? CEO important company important moment, pretty influential figure. Therefore, makes sense would used PR. it’s odd PR team decided would best target politically correct people (who’ll naturally inclined take vaccine) vs targetting skepticals conspiracy theorists using show confidence. Anyone believes CEO isn’t benefitting MASSIVELY COVID sorely mistaken. viewpoint INCREDIBLY different average Joe’s. Creating safe, perfect vaccine message, peel back layers we’re talking things like:

Share price performance, Executive compensation , First movers trillion dollar market COVID created. Notoriety 

Business profits true reason vaccine created swiftly. Anyone thinks otherwise simply naive. Willful naivety cousin ignorance. 	
I see repeated lot don’t think it’s correct. countries well right island countries limited severely restricted travel countries mask wearing already norm. European countries extreme lockdown right back are. Italy recorded largest daily death toll (10 days ago) one stricter longer lock downs. Yea, I'm sure *that's* reason.../s bit wrong.

It's likely people vaccinated ""get"" virus reaches bloodstream, especially first 3-6 months, antibodies generated vaccine still wandering body, grabbing virons marking death. symptoms (the thing that's easy measure) likely minimally infectious, shorter time vaccinated.

If get 3-6 months (for influenza anyway, know long mRNA vaccine continues producing proteins trigger antibody production), generally antibodies left, ""get"" much longer -- body ramp production antibodies again. still, body responds much faster memory B cells.

The biggest issue honestly sudden reduction social pressure. Epidemiologists learned lie us pretend need keep distancing we're still super infectious even we're vaccinated. real reason vaccinated people stop taking care they're exposed (certainly people caring COVID-positive patients can't stop taking droplet precautions), people around stop acting like big deal, even they're vaccinated, change behavior cause infection rate skyrocket.

If vaccinated people stopped wearing masks, it'd fine-ish. would get need to. would spread could prevented spread. we'd screwed we're social creatures, we've seen, can't evaluate relative risk worth beans, without constant social pressure, even smallest measures like wearing mask gets broadly dropped. Natural immunity vaccine immunity two different things. odds vaccine gives immunity far longer one I’m willing bet on. think going happen weren’t vector coronavirus? 

Shit like pandemic wouldn’t happen end animal exploitation period. 500k period months. 109k *current* hospitalizations. agenda there. facts. doesnt believe it. hmmmmmmm  Far people NYC properly gauge that. would say big cities, they're closest. ...former Sergeant Marines, disabled combat veteran, engineer Google, currently involved ongoing construction Salesforce Tower Chase Center. Children getting smarter days. struggle understand different corona similar outbreaks happened since beginning humanity ong vaccines invented. would extinct now. said cut line? literally get line...

Such bullshit. Let ask this: we’re playing monopoly say “look i’m cheating, ill count money front you” unprovoked, doesnt make think twice.

Why create doubt 1 drunk person table whos talking nonsense day anyway yells “hes cheating!” That’s real conspiracy! Biden take Natural immunity could potentially last years. Especially knowing pharma CEOs single altruistic bone body. anti-vaxxers anti-maskers continue play fiddles. 100% bullshit right Yeah, bc Covid quality?!?! I’ll get I’m gonna wait month 2 see others react people families homes.

The majority tech workers live apartments live close by. Big tech companies also shuttle systems made commute non issue part (unless lived extremely far out, basically people homes farther suburbs.)

This beneficial established, older workers homes families. doesn’t pan well 20-30 crowd live cramped city apartments. Quarantined mega yacht. questionname make mistake said ""8 vaccinated"" infected? mean say ""*non*\-vaccinated""? 

Because I'm following reasoning, I'd figure 8 infected placebo group whereas given vaccine case among them. certainly seem confused whole concept viruses spread. I'd suggest looking it, literal reams easily-digestible guidelines informational packets written help people understand frequently interacting immediate household extremely dangerous community. Healthy people long term respiratory side effects much worse vaccine side effects may permanent.



Everyone get vaccine young/healthy not.  everything completely back normal? Nothing remained? mandates measures take before? Everything back complete normal? Yeah needs take it.

However, let's moment imagine people criticizing virus whole, saying bill gates made vaccine etc. Imagine saw TV guy took vaccine; already imagine shouting actor real CEO hidden Panama, vaccine tube filled sugar water. affect trust.

then again, educated people, ones think earth round 5g internet only, still trust vaccine right? guy vaccinated would say trusts employees. likely knows ceo part Pfizer little knowledge actual safety. still take even doesn't. trust comes better known figures president, scientific reports.

sorry story isnt coherent, go sleep believe neutrinos scientist told someone peepee necessarily boy Yeah found really good series Rome recently.

I appreciate guys pointing stuff like out. I've trying remind kid growing world grew in. I'm trying best stay current lol. Pfizer order backlog 520 million vaccines. One vaccines makes difference. 

You might doubts big chunk thread does. 

I think unreasonable doubts. History proven us big pharma trusted blindly.

I feel like defending pfizer ceo afraid cast conspiracy theorist, there's difference blind believing conspiracy. 

Id love take word it, CEO big pharma company isnt taking vaccine neither I'll sleep good decision. Hey fuck Jeff! heart-breaking. Pooo hoooo Similar nyc? no, difference people would die faster. saving grace maybe trump would've died instead recovering Think little concerning lol Turn three gallons loose coins. Yeah obvious. wants altruistic he’d take vaccine instill better confidence growing anti-vax community. work healthcare probably close half people work hesitant take vaccine.

Why would amazed?

Pfizer told Trump administration cannot provide substantial additional doses coronavirus vaccine late June July countries rushed buy supply, according multiple individuals familiar situation.

That means U.S. government may able ramp rapidly expected 100 million doses Pfizer vaccine purchased earlier year, raising questions whether keep aggressive schedule vaccinate Americans late spring early summer.

Trump administration officials denied would availability issues second quarter, citing vaccines pipeline -- immediately, Moderna’s, also expected approved coming weeks. vaccines two-dose regimens, 100 million doses purchased would cover 50 million people each.

“I’m concerned ability buy vaccines offer American public,” Gen. Paul Ostrowski, oversees logistics Operation Warp Speed, government’s initiative expedite vaccine development, said interview Monday. “It’s clear Pfizer made plans countries. Many announced. understand pieces.”

But several officials knowledgeable contracts said supplies companies may insufficient fill gap.

Covid new IQ test. Uhhh... probably get prove efficacy. Looks suspicious tin foil hats lighting everywhere. setting great example many people. 

I personally plan get vaccinated eventually go back bars hoe again. 

 getting vaccine reason good reason. Yay vaccines.  True hero far notion SARS-CoV-2 man made get real support evidence...

Key words: ""So far"" 

I still think underestimating likely would virus studied (whether record off), given unique characteristics purely academic reasons. context accidental release type facility easily capable high level experiments, research study much stretch imagination. current global situation likely level evidence require never found. look forward day find *strong* evidence natural source origins pandemic. would terrible hypothesis presented cited paper proved even partially true. saying it’s going false vaccine? surprised people don’t buy conspiracy? Easily, privy HIPAA-protexted information. last word makes feel important response self important. Oh hesitate. new surge governor refusing shut mayor wants shut down, first time im agreeing De Blasio. definitely knows public cities, seems New York would better prepared. Could going Rightly so. It’s weird. He’s CEO. didn’t get nice Yup, 

I hate weirdly prevailing view science people have: shit backed years scientific research complete mystery read specifics. turn around justify mistrust doctors saying vaccine safe CEO trying seem humble. 

This also completely ignoring thousands people point taken vaccine fine ugh. Hi everyone, 88 year old grandmother Mexico City planning coming dad's house California week. obligation due residency card, dad worried keep safe. dad mechanic dealership, work fast food restaurant. uncle also lives apartment, currently unemployed due virus. 

TL;DR, anyone tips keep elderly grandmother safe working household? I'm offended least. Never really met anyone is. I'm sure could find people are.  Weather plays benefit. already know past year. There’s single bit falsehood wrote. Stop using “fake news!” like trump, shouting everyone speaks anything don’t agree with.

The vaccine probably safe.

The fact CEO company made refuses take concerning stupid. There’s option. It’s either moronic, irresponsible PR stunt (intended make look like goddamn selfless hero; perhaps it’s show already fuckin took it, wouldn’t surprise one bit) doesn’t trust himself.

Literally scenario don’t believe second one officially gives. That’s long way 70%, thank sharing admitting mistake. Lol got special snowflake Stay safe, stay sane, read books, eat cookies. real world, yes, sub hospitals run 25% capacity everyone starts clutching pearls really tight. close way it. doubt even this. think example he's setting great. Elderly needy go first newspaper that? one ones belongs Garrett? I’m sure recognize username then. Cute attempted flex though, POG. Also, fact you’re insecure felt like needed justify adulthood Reddit stranger embarrassing. Ha! Well shoot guess dont think worth dont disagree  Vote democrats. think think one party absolutely agree. constituents broke struggling follow rules, going one outrageously expensive dinner erases credibility.

He gone food bank testing center could safely. made basis agreed upon metrics, e.g. number ICU beds available, positivity rates, etc.. top n states worse stats get vaccine bottom n states best stats. insane much anti-vaxx things I've read sub. think decision noble set example. people wondering this.

Then inventing conspiracy theories pharmaceutical ceo?

The mRNA vaccine disappears body days, yet people believe read Facebook could cause cancers parkingson's 20-30 years.

It way major companies caused distrust climate science. looking good humanity. makes sense, glad hear lol dont need listening facebook experts lol real asshole. Leave alone. someone go infect ER nurse here, I’ve sadly spoken couple people willing get vaccine. People skeptical simply length time development, even haven’t researched anything else process. sad frustrating. try explain points make comfortable I’m met defensive ignorance. well, tried got shot down. US UK, Canada, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia Mexico. It'll also going officials ASAP.

It'll given tens millions people next couple weeks. Hundreds millions time ordinary folks get - that's enough convince people, never going take it. Glad vaccines starting roll out, Biden‘s win official. Nearing end shitty 2020. Also it’s weird can’t access post main sub anymore, posts work daily discussions, go automod profile Open app. think missed part (or wasn’t article, I’ll admit, saw news earlier didnt reread), CEO guy said basically actively planning take vaccine, specifically raise trust. less said “I don’t want cut line, recognize would raise trust, making plans take it”. think want it? OK hear out, microchips don’t turn zombie instantly people take vaccine get activated pass 5G tower???!!!111 Health Minister Jens Spahn counting early start vaccinations coronavirus.

So yeah. Nothing absolutely perfect, including man-made science. Saying otherwise shortsighted.

Then thought, no, people dumb enough pose mask less children strangers Pandemic.

Hah. change it, though. point myopic it. actually someone work remark covid spreading like virus. thought joking.....they not. Oh boy, r/conspiracy hears this... “LED lights” redundant. 

Like ATM machine. fully expected comment end “cotton-eyed Joe” new era citizen travking mass censorship would think people know considering vaccine there's usually people can't get whatever reason Dude prolly lives house moat medical team. risks aren’t like risks. laughed this, I'm sorry... 


(But still, thinking? answer always: weren't...)  Anyone doubts, also consider even really really wanted everything power get ASAP, getting hundreds millions people—many vulnerable populations. It'll administered tens millions end year. really know anything vaccine except ""trust science"". wonder America's Frontline Doctors now? wife decision based us trying kids fear vaccine potentially ruining that. 

I’m sure people say getting vaccine could stop plans family that’s exactly it, it’s double edged sword. Damn dude really one Bull crap doesnt trust yet  think that's necessarily true. Currently 60% United States says going get vaccine. good portion want get vaccine worried either rushed vaccine, trust pharmaceutical companies general. could see fair amount people lending credibility vaccine CEO company created we're one first take it.  title like FB post would say incredibly pretentious big brains saying trust science completely acceptable. 

I say trust science, instead would say trust -insert butchered definition science here- lol ever repercussions fuckups? Like, serious long lasting repercussions would make politicians afraid something shady ever again? Nah. make laws exempting accountability. really last part 🤢 still change tune first 10 million people vaccinated. happen next couple weeks. Hell, US alone 3 million doses next week. one intentionally. taking precautions covid bragging tiktok, assume that’s reference reason move makers vaccine priorty list.

They sophisticated enough contain outbreak spread within organisations.

We small company. Netherlands, rules change like anyway, but...friends mine bring grandparents regardless, strict 14-day quarantine everyone would risk someone family infected. I'd call ""good"" idea, find way grandparents Christmas less safely. 

We also caregiver exemption clause--maybe something similar? Post-birth I'd think solid reason need caregiver short term. getting voted right. People bit pretentious ""I trust verified evidence science"" like okay thats pretentious way saying trust science. yeah could probably understand evidence, scientific papers written layman general population, yeah, they're going trust science. Even understand subject matter, going placing faith accuracy legitimacy. must mistake I’m sorry you’re facing situation. 

This issue worked lots countries. 

Pre-emptive limits elective surgery, upskilling staff, separating campuses units COVID non-COVID teams, urgent testing needing emergency surgery, Telehealth wherever possible, banking prioritising PPE, re-employing retirees casual health care employees preemptively health service, segregating staff avoid cross-infection meal times meetings asking staff stick one hospital / clinic / aged care facility limit transmission sites. 

Along public health measures - masks, working home, remote learning, closing non-essential activities like sports theatres, financial support unable work, “lockdown” areas high community transmission. 

It’s easy cheap, works. 

Hopefully get next months OK, public health measures vaccinations start make difference next year.  Pllease stay home stay safe. people pro-vaccine would call selfish using position take away healthcare worker may prevent people getting it. people anti-vax would say took saline solution. I'm higher risk average mind waiting. many people NEED me. wear multilayered mask use hand sanitizer going store well shopping cart. That's pretty much extent exposure outside world.

It;s paranoia. tactics play larger strategy work. militant types bent someone want share foxhole with. They'd sacrifice heartbeat aided retreat. Unfortunately, Covid-19 Deadlier black people. Supposedly. vaccine sterilizing agent. idea perpetrated deadly black people, would encourage get vaccine, turn sterilizing black people. Shes wrong, racist medical treatment finest. Source stat? think clue. tried experiment implementing fairly light restrictions start November cases started rise again. point, experiment success - stopped exponential growth ""flattened curve"" - linear growth continued. So, know result, they're increasing restrictions try reduce, flatten, spread. honest, pretty sensible. Nice,hoping campaign big sucess. trust vaccines undergone long term trial studies.

Wait 10 years :) true. also make sure kids get it. 

My first thought this'd easy anti-vaxxer. disconnected society, CEOs tend be, anti-vaxxer shit runs deep. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

That's assuming people like supply vaccine, case. There'll tens millions doses administered next couple weeks. It'll administered hundreds millions healthcare workers vulnerable populations ordinary folks get hands it. that's enough sell it, never going take anyways. Except photo, shows many maskless faces. Yeah harm good think month long enough tell long term effects vaccine are? People still saying ""We know long term effects Covid-19, that's need vaccine."" people getting Covid-19 what? 10 months, 12 months ? double standard honestly baffling.. Poor seniors start selling place line rich pay medicine, food heat. think public need prepare side-effects yet known. Moderna's mRNA completely novel technology, seeing first use Covid19 vaccine. 

Astrazena-Oxford Russia’s Sputnik based traditional technologies, slightly longer safety profile data available. 

""I trust science"" leap faith Science telling us know point. evaluated risks benefits taken call world needs think risks now, benefits outweigh them. Obama, Bill Gates took every world leader took vaccine CNN, think people would say gosh, took vaccine people could gotten. think people would say gosh, took it, little confidence vaccine.

You critical thinking skills, kinda sheep people power love. I'm 40 I'm going take vaccine give covid someone else. fairness, I'm freelance tech means I'm constantly risk I'm touching peoples computer equipment. I've always grossed peoples keyboards, moreso. Makes sense vaccinate. important reason... anyone 18. Anyone older, FDA approved 100%.
If remember correctly, abstainer member administration. Also I’m transracial. born white turned black. Kinda like Michel Jackson decided become white 44,000, nearly 50 million next 2 weeks. mean, that’s foregone conclusion it. need look positive cases vs potential cases put together. 
Here Australia positive case isolate least 10 days. However close contact someone tested positive isolate 14 days. coming back country quarantine 14 days. still wearing masks day day completely gone back normal closed borders? must nice able actually go lunch can't even imagine right now. Lol really year people valuing headlines science. vaccine safe. know this. news changes nothing, let’s stop misinformation. care. Thats point, point want decide body without stigmatized. slogan goes ""My body choise""? Maybe know better? work hotel swear twitch every time hear one idiot guests want congregate lobby socialize middle pandemic throw line out. takes every ounce hospitality willpower comment damn stupid arguement is. calling heavy flu, 

chinese scientists nick-named ""mild case nCoV-19"" back january already. Unfortunately tested several possible (partial) escape mutants like E484K, Y453F S477N name able least evade plasma ABs several convalescents. exactly going hurt demand.

And sales done anyways. know 50 had. Two symptoms twice test positive second time (maybe testing issue?); symptoms twice second time much milder. reinfections seem extremely rare anecdotally. think people believe conspiracies even able read Especially mRNA new platform enough data exist evaluate long-term side effects. 

It's lead faith account Science sure. Give break don’t know what’s good supposed outside PR campaigns like one 🤷‍♂️ already tell aren’t economically destroyed depressed time. course doesn’t matter anyone problems smaller drafted BABIES. /s “It’s shifting give time”

“NO RIGHT DAY ONE VACCINATIONS FOREVER”

That’s you, that’s sound like. I've kind kicked around moral dilemma bit. condition could probably spin making extra susceptible virus manage get moved vaccination line. really, know I'm low risk. I'm going play card. wait, even though kind sucks wait. Like doctors, set expectations low people exceed feel good lol Good point. I'm hoping thing ends. I'm getting vaccine university Thursday, alot colleagues getting scared side effects. feeling lot people going get everything political. sad Well fair, rather risk adverse significant reservations first. dove literature inform final decision. sways even one mind, would consider effort success. one tried asprin?  right now, priority convince irrational people trust vaccine.

Why? Let rational people get first. wait line behind moron believes covid hoax vaccine effort implant microchips us? actions cause harm death themselves, they're also cause harm death onto others. care reckless people... endangering lives, others? parents anti maskers... flown ton risk times... 2 year old wears mask problem There’s scientific data support neck gaiters worse wearing mask. sure misinformation coming from. theory based one medical providers research proof that. provide sources? Ive read neck gaiters actually better masks synthetic material made. Nuvaring like estrogen based birth control increases risk types cancer. guess mistake labeling misleading public. link ethinyl estradiol slight increase cancer minimal. likelihood continues increase mutation arises

Perhaps like variant recently observed going huge spike anti vaxers next year won’t take product, you’ll sell billions profit, something amiss. guy doesn’t anything goodness heart. Old technique new virus still means it’s new vaccine. would still dealing tens thousands sample size. want people leave TX, refuse make mandatory. Also, people took lightly probably gonna first catch still get bed took seriously probably gonna catch anyway cause widespread last, beds available what's sad I'd also like point big pharma zero liability vaccine long term damage associated it. We're still consuming animal products several zoonotic diseases spread humans. Yes, could. post comment removed 

Don’t condescending 

We want encourage respectful discussion. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Clearly argument sucks You’re speculating theres proof that. Based video footage clearly tried mask daughter simply refused. else could done? fault we’ve saying need strict regulations day 1, people neglectful kept without care? reprimanded general public didn’t listen initially? want bailout stimulus? Gtfo Yes will. ... Dude, gave vague anecdotal response... random journal article regarding Danish hospitals mask usage?? 

All ignoring remaining ICU capacity single digits almost every single state. 

You’re using facts all. You’re coming conclusion based emotion nothing more.

Doctors **not** canceling surgeries children cancer want to. It’s safety everyone, unfortunately including children. hospital might open bed mean ability safely care recovery. Cancer patients need very, specific care recovery hospitals, that’s option. doctor available doesn’t mean staff available operation itself, let alone recovery either.

It’s horribly complex issue, it’s going tragic fallout, it’s doctors. It’s let virus wreck havoc country, done absolutely nothing curb it. aren’t mass hospitalizations every state, reality said doctor literally wanted prevent occurring. ppl dont know science works. mom thinks bible knows science change story still true despite scientific evidence think many people upset fact - trying whatever spin “wrong” - flies face grossly restrictive damaging dangerous shut downs places like California, Illinois New York, amongst worst handling virus, mandating citizens.

Shutdowns don’t work. two year old son's daycare 12 kids wear masks day everyday. think would hard? wear shoes socks, think uncomfortable them, honestly. Full disclosure: ID specialist. wrote practicing physician colleagues mind focused 18-55 demographic. interpretations data personal opinion constitute formal medical advice expert opinion. Yes. sane thought.  never first model year car, too.  Let early adopters, test out. always easy identify users kids Internet. Usually making uninformed comments control behaviour children. course, always someone niece, nephew cousin crap says something along lines whatever x, surely fault child said behavior. Suddenly exposure near children feel understand pressures parent. remember outlook children, thinking total bullshit ""couldn't understand like parent became parent"". I'm parent realize right.. every day know identify like parent still clue wtf I'm doing. least now, however, identify reality vs fiction raising child...

Something read back one mom forums seems ring true days roll ""When younger thought wow parents control kids. parent realize, wow control kids"". world difference two statements. specifically addressed already saying talks going whether vaccinate ahead demographic’s schedule put people ease regards whether CEO trusts vaccine one, mortality rate closer .6%. Secondly, even people don’t come second dose vaccine, first dose still grants limited immunity. Dooming glooming completely useless, especially genuinely good news first time 9 months. Let’s forget people make politics possible. It’s domino effect. It’s one granny getting shot early, it’s first X getting shots much sooner. 

And millions people, could difference one people. 

And say argument sake shut conspiracy theorists, end line, solves nothing versus later. 

So it’s either minor improvement millions converting crazies earlier treat anyway. really think there's concern point play people think dangerous.

 


Those people way list get anyway think that's correct cause effect here. People already hesitant get vaccine. Partially misinformation conspiracy theory pandering, partly well founded concern.

I’m also expert gives faith every year create new flu shot. Given scope this, much bigger morning sickness major oversights corporate greed eventually destroy company would lot lose. 

The purpose previous comment though really countering need CEO take vaccine show faith conspiracy theorists, point also always conspiracies ‘the drunk guy’ analogy past failures. point though mainly say decisions made different viewpoint level can’t let affect decisions especially optics arent much improved did. Actually yes. UN vaccinating wing ensures access inoculations preventable diseases. would gladly taken it. hope Fauci realises said done, nobody remember bloated pig that, effort promote personal agenda, tried tarnish his(Fauci) good name. one termer worth speck dirt Fauci 's shoe Got pregnant spring... tbh thought would now. Seriously. People irrational fear clouded judgement. It’s really complicated. Take vaccine=gain public trust. probably get vaccine months anyway

It would worse PR got it. one deserves cut line get lifesaving treatment anyone needs Private businesses, governments mean?  Untestd technology never used humans before?  Rushed warp speed? Show 5 year safety data ill get shot. Never tested except 40,000 people tested on. Never get high supply, eh? Many places make mandatory. Nurses aren’t immune stupid ideas. Hell friend nursing school right asked get proof vaccinated black market read miracle morning sickness drug gave pregnant women 50's 60's called Thalidomide. might wrong pfizer one charged like hundred bucks meds high school students could make? anti-vaxxer someone blindly rejects vaccines. don't. vast majority would needed. think extremely important.

A skeptic everyone be, someone questions doubts demands reasonable doubt. vaccine demand reasonable doubt whether people agree not.

Doesn't mean turn safe end. That's point. scientifically safe requires lot peer review external studying. one company vouching product. got pregnant 100% accident good time.

It's like bible thing keeps true forever despite new evidence. disagree entirely, feel that's blanket generalization. There'd percentage would take based that... yes, conspiratards would derp. Link provided:
“Now, emerging research confirms schools aren’t primary drivers outbreaks, cases seep contribute disease’s spread whenever country loses control containing pandemic.”

“ children poor catchers slight spreaders, schools simply mirror what’s happening wider community.”

I’m glad argument semantics. I’m happy say wrong using words “as easily” said “can still spread.” changes nothing situation thread originally anything schools. Cases still happen, kids still transmit human beings, contributes bigger picture large.  need lot careful get news remember reading that, yes it’s population based. makes 100% sense political practical point view. point beneficial image vaccine take since one's expecting CEO's take first lol. dont think even Reddit idealistic expect happen. third uplifting possibility wants people follow suit allow front line take vaccine first ahead may need far protection concerned. tendency (though guarantee) virus mutations less deadly.

However, given almost 20 percent US pop already confirmed case, experts revealed September study actual case numbers 3-20 times higher confirmed cases. assume low end, 60 percent Americans far. Add people cross-immunity coronaviruses innate resistance getting disease, add vaccinations, isn’t many virus able infect reach 70 percent immunity levels experts predict result herd explanation work would long-term disaster vaccine linked serious injuries deaths.

If hurt kill people without harming company, caught lie trivial. Good! annoying forcing us stay home, citing emergency situation, EMA takes leisurely approach approving vaccine though emergency. I'm glad considered unacceptable government level too! ""improve profit""?  so?  Airlines march around yelling ""Fly us!

While 2022 overly pessimistic, plausible, people allow be. Many assume large-scale vaccination, occur upcoming Spring, end point. However, many government authorities may page; seeking extend. Time tell plays out.  Bars probably safest place Iowa Countered conspiraceptibles course Fuck you, Gov. Abbott. Within hours whack jobs social media claiming forced take vaccine. Why? people color tricked taking vaccine. Oh, shit. I’m pretty sure writers study statement (about neck gaiters) based said tested ONE gaiter worse nothing it’s structure, way knowing gaiters, point study show effectiveness varies among masks.

They specifically said results didn’t mean gaiters worse, choosing good one matters research done gilded guild guild yet report conclusive conclusion conclusion material matters r/unexpectedcommuntiy think too.... Probably 50+ percent people 20s had. huge spikes Iowa guess Arkansas, we’re filling fast maskless idiots running around.

Enough young people got spread would also disaster vaccine linked serious injuries deaths, logic hold up. nurse, tell many women become nurses fundamentalist Christians. saying Christians anti-vax/anti-science, it’s something noticed. I’m betting second thing Friend mine 30's diabetes hospital COVID. released, stroke days later. 

This especially true ICU bed staffing shortages - hospitals release sooner typically would need beds. Because, healthcare worker, may elevated risk contracting do, spread patients coworkers. nurse, required get annual influenza vaccine reason. sorry ? bringing another human world comparable ? hypothetical decide actually kids consume resources polute planet. kids reduce carbon fooprint, opinion fact. makes zombies Oklahoma trouble. believe people realised much yet. past two weeks I've seen people die rest year combined. 

But fuck move enough money stable comfortable barely meets minimum wage standards better states... state sucks let go. ""He's side"" I'd say he's little sife considering company made vaccine could save millions lives. I’m sorry
 really should’ve read last reply. 
You really wanted know made personal insults previous comments. (despite snarky criticism texting abilities)
but fact it’s poor reading comprehension issues. right personal insult me. I’m claiming don’t see insult even though you’re you’ve dehumanized demonize okAnd since I’m human anymore you’re really insulting kind get it?


You condition 
I would call disease.
A lot people right now. 
It condition someone involuntarily automatically dehumanize demonize single certain person identity irrationally intense hate opposition group Trump. 
My daughter cannot rational conversation anyone except effected people. . coronavirus, black people injected syphilis informed consent research many died disease. convincing people happening disguised vaccine, I'd say nurse good start. it’s killing hospitalizing anyone, gives shit ist daran falsch leute darauf hinzuweisen dass der mund-nase-schutz über mund und nase getragen werden soll ? solang du dir die socken nich um die knie knotest um die füsse warm zu halten, würde ich da keine verständnishürde sehen. wenn derjenige natürlich aus prinzip gegen alles ist, dann ist der hinweis dass die maske unter der nase absolut garnichts bringt selbstredend vergebens. first wave reported also heavy smokers. could framed whole thing protecting manhood could gotten trucknuts crowd board basic social responsibility last year. fucking stole N95 masks spring like bunch fucking pirates. sad see many suffering US they've done themselves. elect cheetos, actually follow advice medical professionals. much distrust medical profession used fleeced insurance companies can't understand doctors want healthy. crazy. There’ll plenty countries though want travel outside country though, get shots go certain parts world unless want get sick die, different. matter even though likely work. late change anything stan king Tuskegee experiments one sad subreddit fact, current vaccines might make ""cases"" mild asymptomatic. 

Remember, practically trials followed participants based symptoms. Oxford/AstraZeneca British arm followed PCR, hence possibly lower reported efficacy. Well, say *I'm* kinda laughing it, we've really left house since Thanksgiving... so, think *we're* fine (and continue so, foreseeable future, now). would disaster false claim level found out. happens, world literally kiss vaccine goodbye. President United States America, ladies gentlemen. Wow thank amazing contributuon, definitely helps know 25% 80% Covid positive people aware symptoms. wonder 301,000 Americans died Covid aware whether Covid symptoms not. Hey virus *only* kills 1% people Covid anyway, might well dive herd immunity come thing 3,200,000 dead Americans. selfish doctors medical workers could handle little unprecendented massive surge ICU patients, right? mean ""iSnT sIgNeD fOr?"" 

Why dumbasses use three four arguments taken context completely meaningless situation? bad math/statistics something? self centered? Please tell education failed *A C U L L Y*

Holy shit, must fun parties.  Oregonian I’ll apologize anti-science dipshits state. We’re one places US bipartisan science denial! sneer “dumb” states like Mississippi yet MMR vaccination rate pales comparison. we’ve several large measles outbreaks recently. always stop answer getting question....

Big difference between: 
1. Herd immunity - get many infected possible fastest possible way build natural herd immunity 
2. Flatten curve - Also herd immunity strategy, keep hospitals going lower spread manageable level get vaccine day future (what Sweden world do)  
3. Eliminate virus (NZ, Australia, Asian countries)

Since never answer, can't sure talking number one two, always thought talking number one. ""Tegnell herd bla bla"" number two, fully agree them, like world doing. talk number one, restrictions actions them. problem I'd say risk semi-low... though I'd add, time distribution around turn positive. near end, around minutes Santa coughed hand, similar? sits throne LIES! mean "" injected saline solution live"" rest us covertly injected 19inch 600 lbs server rack. wAkE shEEpLe! happen, probably attend vaccinated athletes need vaccinated Meanwhile Pfizer CEO taken vaccine yet shouldnt make suspicious unless actual antivaxx smoothbrainer, lol.  data efficacy vaccine preventing transmission?

None. 

It reasonable expect reduce transmission certain level, stop it. Also, would probably take fake vaccine. Staged stunt mocking poor. Praise science!
Ooh science, praise it. seen many maskless nurses lately admitting, camera, nurses “...the priority convince irrational people trust vaccine.”

And how, precisely, one convince irrational people make rational choice?

Psychologists equal rights advocates wanna know. would good way publicize there's little risk. 

Plus, opinion, deserves it. move forward instead wasting time pointing finger? many people feel need assign blame everything? want see side effects peoples. combine statement call death people get vaccinated, well...

Are trolling? curious something like could built also whether would demand it. wonder types business meetings would worth flying multiple hours sit across airtight plexiglass divider also accomplished via zoom? There's place near right. normally ""historic town"" type walk actors, 1800s classic Victorian Christmas card. set Santa big red chair Christmas tree surrounded lots toys INSIDE house, kids pose OUTSIDE house peaking window Santa. cute, Santa can't play super spreader. 

I know well lines handled, though--I've seen photos set up. It’s crazy needs said... dumb wasteful

Nah. brings joy neither dumb wasteful! also find funny ""mall center Santa training organization"" (or whatever hell is) made rather big deal ""training mall Santas use video conferencing"" year. local news actually featured story week two ago, now. company “works” created it. Woooow hero 🤣🤣🤣 Oh, we’re celebrating CEO pharmaceutical company humanitarian efforts, eh?

Lol point can't tell comments like satire people actually believing shit like this. would automatically die dont get vaccine? Great idea... inject everyone mutate virus much possible... could go wrong... Dutch word used speech Prime Minister 'thuisblijven', translates stay home. order. Orders like politically tricky 75 years ago.

He states exercising alone outside (example cycling/running) disallowed even recommended. also also makes remark rented house vacation-park somewhere else Netherlands Christmas still go there. usually located middle wooded areas. IDK, people omitting contacts, testing available, contacts negative tracing delays... started 12 yesterday evening, leaked news 12 morning, many, many people went shopping, superbusy. Long rows normal shops, gifts stuff.

There even rows shops stay open...

They interviewed people, shopping clothing stuff. ""We let get taken us""

I know lot people Netherlands *are* right thing, country also full brainless people tbh, I'm pretty disappointed us all.

My family relaxed it. ""We want live!"" corona. turns out, joke. still *really* acknowledge it. Still calling heavy flu, smell taste good they're supposedly better, super, super tired time now. that's normal, twitter says that's normal.  I'd say bet. Especially since reminds much ""vaccine"" Dauntless Yeah, admit, empathy parents essentially zero... courts maybe cite child abuse child endangerment, though?!? winter

More like next 5 years.

Within 5 years we'll likely pretty high-profile documentary nothing videos people telling stories. know, restrictions lifted filmmakers actually go start interviewing them.

I feel like that's big part reason heard much human toll exacted yet. Previously quarter million 300k killed single event, like American deaths WWII (291k), deaths Confederate side Civil War (290k+), ongoing stories affected shared. Hell, even Vietnam conflict, ""only"" 58k American deaths, changed way US wages reports war due constant display human suffering nightly news. Sure, mostly Vietnamese side, ""high"" death toll US servicemembers one reasons unpopular war. deaths took *decade* accumulate.

And are, 4 Vietnams later, less entire WWII casualty rate later and...lots apathy. Malls bug retail still open. great. Apparently wrong save humanity paid thing.

I hate become people. ok help world *and get paid*. One vaccine change situation Uh.......huh. think bigger issues here. sanity safety, probably take break social media. Go walk woods turn reddit.  drive thru banking discriminate working class? Can't spread vaccinated people.  He's never going get vaccine 😂😂 r/ShitLibSafari Apologies ambiguous, specifically meant claim injecting COVID-19 body. That's vaccine works. sister idiot. don’t know got downvoted. upvote Maybe you’re, like, ICU, requiring everyone always every situation forever totally unreasonable. would definitely negative effects therapeutic relationship thinking heard new strain making way across London.

Can anyone knowledge subject shed light whether current vaccines work potential new strains??

I'm looking scaremonger pessimistic want know heard radio yesterday new strain, saying Chief Medical Officer England saying worry vaccine still work intended however growing skeptical ""official"" sources head telling ofcourse even not, reporting surely want cause hysteria even won't.

Ofcourse asking ranomers Internet never reliable source information say certainly smart cookies reddit definitely know talking about. Dunno are, it’s law life jacket available boats, law wear smaller boats riskier waters.
 
So yeah? Wear mask shops hospital. That’s principle life jackets compulsory riskier situations. (No sarcasm.)

Not wearing one eating (even though it’s risky) even follows logic wear life jacket diving.  Don’t wear mask alone wear life jacket beach. Messenger RNA vaccines use entirely different manufacturing process vaccines. Using DPA force vaccine manufacturer create vaccine doesn’t use equipment manufacturing doesn’t much good. likely could swap, never see test run, therefore one say 100%.

The point second dose reexpose immune system antigen, helps create stronger response. antigens same, face compatibility there. I’d rather catch spread flu like past life enjoyable wear uncomfortable mask 8 hours day grocery store job rest life flu season. stop pandemic/saving lives COVID start becoming “new normal” make people past risk gone? wonder people don’t comply now. It’s taking away thing fight for/ light end tunnel normality. 60% time, works *every time*... * taps forehead * Totally true. general problem liberal political philosophies centuries. kind aggressors end destroying result. arguing Reality Non-Duality, God people call Him/Her/It. split objective subjective beginning illusion call world. love put makeup, may wear one forever! Commercial UV systems safeties turn lights time access door opened. Portable air cleaners UV already exist, although use UV sanitize filter low airborne kill rate. UV widespread rare either existing commercial HVAC systems. 

Double light, half time true. UV absorbed dose relevant quantity, amount UV energy virus absorbed. information false? experimental vaccine long term effects known. You’re right. jumping jacks sudden realization cut ear vaccine? Belief doesn’t require backing/proof, like religion

It’s trusting scientific process ask why? *eyes roll* Depends. likely think it’s going 240-250 million people (~75% US population) vaccinated 3-4 months (500 million vaccines)? don’t mean Debbie downer...but want people understand next big milestone we’ve got get aren’t surprises. 

I personally think April stretch, would happy proven wrong. I’m thinking closer early/ mid Q4 2021. Thanksgiving.

Look death stats. CA's restrictions steadily brought 50 day (40 million population!) two straight weeks November ...from 140s August. took 3 months this.

In three weeks, gone 150s.

We celebrate Thanksgiving pay price.

(All stats 7-day moving average.) Combining 64,700 excess deaths (though really we'd want deaths several weeks now, month ago) 4.7 million infections implies IFR still 1.2%, number given study late spring. Using 48,400 tested deaths (but again, we'd want tested deaths like 4 weeks serology week) gives number still 1%. 

This actually seem possible, something different must going on. 10% prevalence general population, much higher elderly care homes? Yeah, normal march happening. seems likely, though, end ongoing state emergency hospitals end March majority vulnerable populations get vaccinated. *absolutely* huge. Fauci suggests it'll 'open season' vaccines April, kind doubt, he's right we're probably looking beginning return normalcy late May early June. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* answer question, live reality evidence-based. checked comment history first coming conclusion spreading disinformation either 1) ignorance, 2) intentional maliciousness.

You posted article hospitals overflowing tents 2017-2018 flu, context, false attempt portray current crisis COVID-19 similar equal. would this? let comment another thread answer motives: say ""there available ICU nurses"" throw hands up, nurses hired, trained, field hospitals built, military medics deployed hard hit areas, etc. none happening? real crisis. 

If someone posts earth flat, message presents information misleading manner order deceive others, person ""presenting another viewpoint"".  manipulating facts order deceive, one vile, reprehensible acts human commit. aiding abetting uneccessary deaths hundreds thousands people, believe say, charitable calling stupid. really producing vaccines distributed US within US. Pfizer producing EU vaccines facilities within EU, one Belgium one Germany. temperature requirements vaccine, would make much sense Pfizer produce vaccine US ship EU. probably allocating raw materials production center based amount orders country. Theoretically, raw materials created US, maybe US gov could seize redirect MI production facility, highly doubt case. Thank you. silly sounds it’s nice know I’m alone! getting general sense Reddit really doesn’t like kids think needs matter all. It’s pretty sad. see us still problem even vaccine. people skeptical still going filling hospitals dying, there's lot too. fifteen states estimated Rt factor 1, compared one state month ago

so much ""post-thanksgiving surge"" don’t wear 24/7 school every social situation countries. Stop trying suggest mandate prevent tiny colds past pandemic.
Do whatever want, pandemic feel. It’s new normal thing. worst thing feel need keep watch that's good. Bell's palsy mostly minor temporary annoyance. Looks like virus agenda. you’re saying Pfizer ceo getting vaccinated somehow instill confidence people get vaccinated, aren’t you? don’t believe don’t want vaccinated Pfizer ceo, fauci, past presidents getting vaccinated camera make difference. 

Pfizer ceo get vaccinated never. don’t really care. agree limited number high ranking government officials important enough vaccinated early. Fauci one them. I'm going honest, hope mask usage sick continue far future. mandatory anything, something courteous like Japan. Maybe Newsom issue double secret ban outdoor dining, since it’s strong impact case count said certain places. one trying party get drunk doctors office. worst people turned ""real news"" getting information homemade articles facebook. agree you, wearing masks pandemic making kids wear fine it’s dire. new normal people disgust me. Exactly. sad part majority give fuck anymore. ""all me"" mentality now. anyone, Doctor Fauci included, thinks people going wear masks limit social activity we've reached point, they're completely insane.

Where say that? Stop making stuff up.

He ""It's going gradual, think know see level infection country dramatically lower level right start gradually tiptoeing toward normality,"" said. 

Just saying use caution ease slowly monitor along way. Americans can't they? gotta go full throttle recklessly, hell everyone else. coronavirus's terribly high death rate, right. No, vaccine already produced waiting approval Germany funded development BioNTech vaccine therefore EU got better deal, getting vaccine shots faster cheaper. Sucks one pre production Actually 9 months late. Lol. love you’re pretending knew people already vaccine 5 months ago. 

In first comment, 6 months starting today enough time eyes see long term consequences. 

Why sudden change heart needing whole year? Different lipid coatings described What’s from? odd one commenting fact video article nothing headline. video he's talking restaurants airports contributing spread. even mention masks. fact, click source listed article, links back article. can't find anything Independent features Fauci actually saying this.


Welcome journalistic COVID articles 2020! point articles gain cheap clicks sell story costs (even one must resort lies) order scare population! First time? Yeah Bass Pro Shop company. right washing hands masks help, would attribute getting cold social distancing mask wearing hand washing.

I got full blown cold 6 times year pre-COVID worked open plan office. think realistic ask average Joe wear mask 8 hours day office unless we're pandemic. saw poll 40% definitely getting 45% may get soon. denier thought media sensationalizing it. survives, may double down.

 [Tenn. State Rep. David Byrd Battling COVID-19 Carter June voted support House resolution stating ""mainstream media sensationalized reporting COVID-19 service political agendas."" get two shots spring I’ll feel much better hanging friends safe manner possibly able eventually dine indoors long afterwards. Stuff like that.



You absolutely plonker. Wait 2023 early 2024 earliest safe. Stay home, stay safe. need least 5-25 years really tell deaths go zero. Even one unacceptable. STAY HOMMEEEEEE FOREVERRR cause grow 4 butts sign up! I’ve worked 10-15 hours 6 days week months , honestly wanted leave work, sleep brace tomorrow. There’s point goal survival. social activities, dance routine, dating.

At going bars one day friends getting plastered.

I’m sharing experience, people know. Liposomes deliver mRNA.

The aav vector using 2 doses. That's astrazenica thinks lower first dose higher efficacy though - immune response aav real question be, start opening up? many people need vaccinated OK? I'm getting vaccine, many others need well. What's #? next: scientists seek determine whether water flows downhill. Well hate wearing work 8 hours day job physical. uncomfortable OCD high sensitivity sensation. also sit yell old fat people wear masks pull nose, never comply to. I’m wearing pandemic!!! it’s small sacrifice. all. I’m wearing forever Grammy doesn’t catch cold. Yes I’m sick transit maybe. acting like there’s nothing lost cover face, can’t really make expressions, work physically hours it’s uncomfortable, can’t theatre concerts on, can’t really perform well sports. absolute shining genius intelligence forum right time chief. places vaccinating elderly first. Make sure install CA Notify app. Well fine, arguing metaphysical duality, think lot people, especially western religions, would agree with.

If want go rabbit hole, check panpsychism Processing disorder? ellaborate🤔 lives saved since March mean nothing? crock shit. Keep mind millions can't take there's enough studies prove vaccines safe. doctors recommending folks wait studies completed. Pregnant people, kids 16, immuno compromised people illnesses. Georgia back normal since last May. found stock guy.... govt paid almost double less half doses Pfizer. don’t understand point. 

If paid Pfizer upfront didn’t succeed would even worse position. reiterate: March AZ sure bet could get shitty situation. Every western country ordered doses AZ relative others. mistake end buying table. hindsight 20/20. govt put 10b Pfizer none AZ, we’d riding wave herd immunity May one vaccine. didn’t. going criticize too? HAIs always big concern. would postulate pandemic creating enough research data spread airborne diseases fill small canyon. So, it’s hunch hospitals would implement cheap easy preventative good harm. speculation though. me, normal able sit inside bar restaurant frigid Chicago winter afternoon evening, able go game, able buy liquor 9pm again, able go Vegas worry what's even open city, etc. 2020 still great year lots people business. didn’t wear mask made stupid comments media Tulips out, Bars fully open. No, UV light one. seems like that's possible. 200 common cold viruses, I'm sure would work. Fair real Onion? Greetings Europe, universal health care question RE: testing scientists there. saturday, got rapid PCR test. rapid came back positive day. Today, PCR came back negative. assumed PCR would trump rapid, Dr. said likely rapid actually accurate, PCR might picking virus yet developed symptoms. advised still quarantine 14 days, I'm fine with.

I also mentioned tested positive antibodies May, sick April. I'm confused test trust? general consensus seems PCR accurate, still dont fully understand could show negative result, rapid positive. mean??? TY! Yes, situation constantly changing. someone like me, who's hard hearing? get normally, everything muffled can't read lips. year absolute nightmare front. wear glasses, masks make hard see anything. Get facts! anecdotal information friend another friend posted something Facebook someone cousin knew trumps evidence-based information. Brazil we're forever march's aftermath It’s security theater. Every time go OB take temp one thermometers, usually measure 93-96 F. Like clearly 93 I’d dead. someone gets normal temp? assume they’re actually feverish? makes sense know thermometers aren’t accurate all. people judge assholes. like people judge others starting socialize/gather get de minimis level deaths/hospitalizations critical mass vaccinations also assholes.

Wish could agree shit others personal ways dealing this. people getting sick worse isolation, others isolation worse getting sick, long point elderly/high risk longer substantial danger, respect others' decisions regarding personally feel comfortable resuming normal life.

/soapbox That's weird religious cult verbiage right there. hope ok. Pfizer 👹 I've known bad year, seeing close devastating. 
Stay safe friend.  tell ""good you""? work required anything like that, would quit. People different preferences. Oh shit, I'm sorry loss. expecting return normalcy sooner 2022, bridges sell you. old article tho? People go restaurants way often go concerts, yeah restaurants would contribute transmission community. didn’t see anyone celebrating. person thought virus media hoax, undoubtedly led others conclusion, he’s ventilator. That’s tragic it’s avoidable, choose listen. wanting pray someone hardly celebrating. comment first true LOL months. I’m young healthy . turn I’m going refuse dumb reason. guess $10 virtually free.

Here Melbourne want many people possible tested day. symptoms whatsoever... However mild, asked get tested, free.

If around anyone symptoms, get tested. want test like sticks nose, get tested.
My son sniffle went got test. really .... giant PPP slush fund big corporations, nothing people (unless qualify unemployment). damn, exactly six corona virus? fair number vaccines first works month stops working... want add election didnt help either US bad EU good sentiment. P3 human trial complete yet? Merck giving DMV run money. know lots people refuse get vaccine. None give shit covid none cares people around take precautions either. doesn’t help thanks. yeah, that's thinking. also dad high risk group would like take too. id feel lot better risk vector him. Good thing J&amp;J looking promising. Fore don’t wanna explain it’s illegal talk bye anybody look forward resisting resistance, vaccinated. buy this? 

20 minutes game changer. could take outside parent’s house wait results going in. 

I’m aware it’s probably 100% certain, would massive increase safety, combined masks distancing every day life. I'm sorry got downvoted this, /u/steelerfaninperu, absolutely right publicly posting videos could dangerous nurse doctor's job prospects. 

Not even necessarily now, pandemic, perhaps next year year demand drops opportunity layoffs comes around. 

I want anyone risking career. want emotions experiences lost forever. don’t care do. care high amount commenters Reddit attack saying don’t want wear mask future unless sick call killer. don’t like sub constantly says accept new life long normal. distressing told wear mask every flu season rest life people sub daily. talk individually get sense point them, personally, consider 'safe enough' define 'back life normal'. interested enough.

There officially mandated 'need' keep wearing masks, choose keep wearing them. reasons. I’ve heard Dr. Fauci said ideally 85% population needed vaccinated beat this(herd immunity diseases 90-95%) survey saying 70% willing, covid stick around longer needed. depends responsible public acts covid numbers go down, stays people don’t get vaccinated, don’t blame public health officials that. may keep wearing mask every winter.
My face never warm cold months. also financed 350 million € german tax money want vaccine, that's prerogative. I'm young healthy enough really need it. Might well save old sick. Yeah, unfortunately likely true.

Pandemics come century, usually time we've forgotten lessons last one.

Still, lot society's defenses came lessons we've learned previous diseases, hope apply lessons we've learned one going forward. example, think ever get plane without wearing mask, I'm getting one vaccine COVID fully rolled out. optimistic hopes. truly hope turns way. Please let know willful ignorance ended working end. know sucks recourse world leaders have, even enough vaccine countries, like cure 4 family members asking give help someone else, people make sure family taken care first love him. develop 15 months? waiting year help. 

That’s question. coming conclusion period time appropriate wait? 1. Officially president elect. Cannot change now. 

2. aware vaccines work. concerned timing comically ironic. doubt every country kept complete visiting ban since start pandemic now. see relevant said?

If want make highlight that, recommend bury deep almost one see it. completely misreading said reacting blindly without actually reading it, seems. YES AFFECTS YOUNG ALSO. much. YES EVERYONE WEAR MASK, PERIOD. protect risk. ffs. one point outside Antrim Area Hospital, 17 ambulances containing patients lined outside emergency department. Doctors treating patients car park. Nah. I’m enjoying deconstructing guys’ retarded logic. 

At least consistent beliefs. can’t seriously believe transmission would lower massive concert halls restaurants loud music everyone “wearing mask*TM”  either magic bullshit. decide want eat. PR campaigns news outlets smorgasbord both. know yet. Stage 2 trials safety (it's safe). Stage 3 tells effectiveness be. I'd imagine going right line others 60%. far above, knows. Keep mind even 60%, 40% likely still mild symptoms prevents bad symptoms almost everyone. I’m hassling people morons endangering public refusing vaccine good reason. 

What data gather next 6 months relevant? question.  Hard eye-roll “this sub”. It’s majority people speak way every day life. I’m saying I’ll probably wear mask public cold flu season, since it’s publicly acceptable, really big deal wear one. 

Why disagree? World mock so? fact that, human race, ""going back normal"". us always act heightened sense awareness things...if reason make sure happen again. Weird Lol k. I’m essential worker risky environment (I wear mask 8 hours day) lost housing March Covid restrictions think I’m sick Covid killing people myself. never said sick wouldn’t wear mask! read comments, people advocating wearing whole flu season. I’m pretty sure wearing months every year different sick only. It’s life long sacrifice. I’ve seen people say protect immunocompromised need wear public 24/7 could asymptotically flu. getting ridiculous point.  I've heard drug side, looked vaccine side, hazards could present anything ingested/injected. fair skeptical people saying self interest trying best - definition cynicism. president background epidemiology WH reports believed, rarely attends daily briefings. want believe, qualified individuals TV show various networks (republican democrat leaning) individual history misleading, 0 background medical field? 

Trump said would vaccine 2020. is, isn’t widely available won’t mid possibly late 2021. right would one relatively soon time wasn’t window way off. (Also I’m saying remotely hateful?) Fair. someone spends 12 hour shifts wearing mask, really don’t see much inconvenience, especially much avoid situations would require one. agree Marijuana, rest political. think main focus reforming justice system repairing infrastructure. chronic cough scarring lungs bad year altogether. Bye! asian countries wear masks due pollution infectious disease spread Yes strange, like 'poor' country producing rich...
In usa 200 million people vaccinated end February got vaccinations 3,5 million people end March... biontech financed 350 mio € german tax money get anything time rely astrazeneca junk. sure gigabrain politicians tell use disadvantage give biontech stuff countries blablabla... Symptomatic positive feel this. Difficult trust someone who's done/said horrible things past. much population? Survey showing 70%(best number) willing get vaccine someone like Dr. Fauci saying 85% what’s needed. care 6 months now? said wanted wait 1 year trials started. 

In evaluation risks, public vaccinations starting completely irrelevant.

And don’t quite understand came conclusion 12 months somehow appropriate time wait rather 6 months. eyyyyyyyy information known approval so, disclosed public media government manufacturer. feel without transparency difficult keep publics trust. keep watching interviews asking long term effects response same.

Paraphrasing ""This definitely safe, science there. also developed quickly know long term effects be"". double speak like politicians feels deceptive. It’s approach, it’s merely happen without special action taken.

We debate next decade proper research done it. warehoused elderly... really? Give head shake. talking people’s loved ones. people matter. unbelievable. truth. person define ""we got vaccinated safe"". maybe ten million vaccines. maybe one million vaccines. maybe ""we"" means best friend. sniffles. Donald Trump says walk off. Bonus points: Every one line gets covid wind blows. Yes 🙌🏼 
Although never entirely comfortable eating Mexican Indian. food rona? Lol Good luck that. needs selection process weed useless companies. Currently use profit method reward companies produce useful output remove don’t. 

There nothing legally speaking prevents creating company puts workers power. problem workers act interests little work possible making impossible remove lazy toxic employees company eventually drag company unable produce anything.

The government meant act balancing force ensures baseline welfare everyone without preventing companies functioning properly. aware paper. Good know.  USA almost certainly could this, since many states refusing pass PII federal government concerns using database illegal aliens. So, go different state, and/or make name. 

Of course, ethical reasons shouldn’t it’s still short supply... widely available... Ahhh yes olestra chips!! still laugh everytime see joke futurama! manageable. wear glasses hardly problem. close contact confirmed case symptoms, I'm doctor, that's case Covid matter gets tested not. happen people get vaccinated masks stay till hospitals longer overrun. happens reality masks start come general pop gets vaccinated, people gather even sick, keep seeing cases longer necessary. Vaccine silver bullet, it’s one tool beat covid Sure thing Big Mud Concerts much larger gatherings restaurants. go concert also wear mask.

Take shit back r/CoronavirusCirclejerk. Feel free cross post too. people develop side effect 9 months in? We’re sick COVID killing people you’re sick getting wear lipgloss. point wear mask you’re sick future, even “just sniffles.” point subjecting everyone else sickness stop 99% mask. fucking hate straw man much want beat shit bat. 

If older teenager still say shit like this, absolutely concept world works mommy daddy still pay everything don’t pretend know anything works. hide behind ""wealthy countries"". Name shame. countries blocking waivers countries supporting waivers? Holy shit lmao read it. says asymptomatic spread sharply reduced - words, vaccinated people much less likely spread disease. Exactly. crunch time war room, last thing wanted hang around socialize coworkers. Get outta home! $600 complete joke especially considering much money already got funneled companies need it. seen people say permanent.

Those people mentally ill. baffling sane person would advocate that, see too. 

You're bad selfish person wanting wear mask perpetuity. That's normal. normal. asking lol 

And yeah bet CDC would. somebody currently middle nursing school, taught comes pharmaceutical drugs, trial periods take literal years patient ever ask drug safe document document years research proof back it. alone that’s teaching getting right now, kind understand coming vaccine works less year, skipped many important animal trials given out. I’d personally weary least didn’t enough knowledge vaccine. Holy fuck leave subreddit think hospitals get *worse* vaccinate people responsible 97% deaths. hassling people?

Who said they’re safe 12 months? People want data rushed vaccine. Yeah can't make heads tails this. people really follow guidelines? Probably not.

Though surge tests Thanksgiving, maybe people positive participate much?

In bats, spring fall phenomenon I'm aware of? Like, spreading times year adaptation bat behavior?

Really confusing. lose it, it'll get shifted next year selfish all. strain healthcare workers much tragedy effects patients. would also argue we're situation little control big picture, caring community best chance making difference. hope friends family ok. highly doubtful actually 7x many unfounded cases. Look happening throughout country hospitalizations. Use hospitalizations key looking number unfound cases. currently people hospitalized ever before. myth many unfound cases spring hold water simply looking hospitalizations. virus widespread spring sure major hotspots New England instance I’m sure large amount unfound cases area spring translate equally regions country many seeing extreme outbreak Denial what? waste.. that's you. don’t think it’s weird hold webinars - think it’s another part substantial body evidence (alongside numerous interviews articles) promoted approach handling pandemic outside Sweden’s borders. likely won't, know, countries US/EU/Canada hard time getting access vaccines.

We also still clinical trials children vaccinations. know they're asymptomatic vectors need vaccinated.

There also several people wait-and-see approach vaccine. yeah, mass immunization likely take years.

Does saying basic scientific knowledge stuff makes prophet? make prophet-pointer obtuse? Pfizer said would distribute 25 million doses US end year, 100 million already bought March. know got numbers, NY Times said. Lmao people aren’t wearing masks years dude. also cannot take vaccines even want due allergies issues wrong thinking public actually follow directions wear mask. Come April /May stop wearing mask regardless recommendation /CDC /local health department etc I’ve met few. scary. old colleague involved literally every MlM could get hands on. Yes, unlike Pfizer vaccine Moderna one require ultra cold storage. also stored regular refrigerator week, make much easier distribute still effective. actual inventor PCR test said Dr. Fauci? Interesting. US, maybe. world, I'm sure.

if someone militantly wearing mask, really think they're going rush readily get vaccine? millions, tens millions, viciously reject vaccine cultural grounds Science sentient methodology. Stop viewing science like view scripture maybe start seeing moving parts constantly meshing changing around you. Honestly hope I’ll able least one person class end next semester, don’t care learning period. want celebrate things going back normal Somebody left /s tag? Man sucks hope thing get better.

I expect 2021 improvement. low bar based 2020. Hang there! get feeling “just shut everything down” crowd privileged class never provide themselves. check privilege. Trump right said virus would go away April! 
/s case get slammed Wow I'm sorry. biggest impact faced bullying middle school gym class. nothing compared went through.
 
Do know something person once? immune risk? Keeps face warm find pretty ones go outfit.  Yeah, would ethical would result international backlash would harm good. we'll nearly halved actual potential deaths/hospitalizations

Then deaths 50% higher per capita countries effect cold spread may greater effect policy

That would make sense Sweden looking fatalities. Toward middle summer, looked like hit type seasonal herd immunity threshold deaths impressively low suddenly mid October crept quickly. scariest ad Covid I’ve seen came [The Lincoln Project. 

It spooked me. Still does. know members congress seems like bad idea, think relatively small number them, one place, required country congregate rooms together travel. makes sense get vax asap think understand level leniency lot places going get nurses right now. know traveling nurses turning ridiculous offers go North South Dakota. 
 
I know nursing student said offered job still nursing school local hospital working state / nursing school secure licensing start working NOW. 
 
A lot nurses caught COVID either died still fully recovered it. lot nurses quit seeing co-workers get sick die hospitalized. lot medical professionals experiencing SEVERE burnout. 
 
Hospitals everywhere else hires nurses DESPERATE. Luckily wild animals significantly easier avoid close modern life humans. called person selfish (and weak childish) wanting wear mask rest life, preferring risk catching occasional flu. 

That totally rational decision.

You free scream average people every flu season leaving homes bare faced, certainly position calling anyone childish. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I work stable hand teen, get bunch Elon Musk got tested 4 times one day, 2 positive, 2 negative doses already sold countries.

The answer yes, send troops confiscate vaccine, probably worth international shitstorm. yes even dumb fat americans anti vax take shot cheetos available due lock downs.  Also, mRNA vaccines also manufactured quicker traditional still free will, freedom choice human rights, recall correctly, ain't taking vaccine anyway. start Trumping else name calling, I'm Hebrew follow Torah really need know ""political position"". is.

Um, mean might article may also reduce spread appears prevent spread virus also evidence one dose Moderna's may stop virus's spread

Obviously hope does, article say that's proven anywhere.

Maybe referencing different article? mean would wonderful news. Even dating someone living city feels like long distance relationship pandemic Mass immunization likely come 2022

He prophet. obviously shot NBA Covid testing. Yes it’s standard hospitals require people vaccinated work. I’ve worked multiple hospitals. None requiring anyone get covid vaccine. 

Maybe it’ll required years now, it’s happening data long term. here, man. wrong; 2020 extremely fucked up. Idk *New York Post* reporting wild animals enough vaccines *ALL* mammals! can't mutate species, it? Hey hometown made sub! gonna knockout comeback story bro, gotta keep best, try get good people around you.

I know *nothing* life, can't pretend give advice really understand gone through. However, say is: on, get better, long keep trying.

Truly wish best, one battered soul another. Whaaaaaaaaaatt!!? swear fealty lord saviour baphomet without wearing mark? Guess won’t able start death cult anytime soon either?/s Thank answering. yes need heal world song artist. something ties everything together heal world. unfortunately music bit lackluster well W.A.P. number 1 apparently. I'll take vaccine, gladly, I'll still doubt two. trust science, slow moving emergent kind build decades centuries. mean trust every innovation study conceived scientific means. Honestly ""don't believe science bro"" argument kind dumb. Sounds like virus moving around, crossing state borders, ruining reputation good governors? Insidious virus... vaccine redundant lol. amount people still going die, causes Smooth brained take. Yea, that's heartbreaking like noted: treatable!

I'd like see US rich countries commit buying J&amp;J vaccine extenuating circumstances within borders donation third world countries.

It seems insane think pandemic could continue substantially longer countries like India many villages undeveloped infrastructure California could save dollars. California could afford get refrigerators. Indian villiage even reliable enough electrical power it.

But that's could come to. shots reserved people can't get others. don’t go I’m sick.

I wish could get coworkers call sick. Instead cycles ""office plague"" rip couple times per year. 

Granted, think matters I'm remote worker. say move another state. said fucking state. Cool, except didn’t write news article comment. Esti de calisse de bordel de merde! want work home forever. ;_; find hard believe big corporation would spend millions upon millions dollars ultra cold freezers simple test would show whether vaccine stable somewhat higher temperature Yeah, one going stick patient Sepsis COVID ward.

What heck talking about? resort covering face insecure others request? That’s pretty extreme step might want talk somebody about. Thank staying home sick. autoimmune disease I'm pretty much stuck home cold/flu season many people don't. Last time caught cold sick 3 months. Oh god. Thank fuck orange heading soon.  Please publish video publicly (obviously respect patients privacy). People need see happening. many, COVID myth. deaths happen private. people see happening, may change minds something least want discuss manager. even fine it, spouse? Also get another job, allow it. I've debated same, much uncertainty go it. ultimately hope companies allow least 2 maybe even 3 days remote work. greatly help work/life balance.  think number you’re referencing, may repeated articles, amount individuals need immunity reach heard immunity.

This different number. many need vaccine. 85% population vaccinated ~90% efficacy rate, get “heard immunity percentages” you’re referencing: ~70-80% totally population. No, saying we'll state hardcore lockdown-esque restrictions early winter. said begin gradually returning normal beginning distribution COVID-19 vaccine. return normal complete December 2021/January 2022 latest. Besides, Fauci gives pessimistic estimates case. Back November estimated vaccine January 2021, wrong. could well wrong here, again, giving pessimistic estimate possible. website works simply cleanly every order. Can't say lot sites. Don’t come work military... mission first, people second literal world war going Europe ravaging countries directly attacked one axis powers simply providing supplies allies, hardly think apt comparison. 

I’m masks, social distancing, following clear cut science COVID stupid comparison. Context: Meridian 87 miles away Pearl. amount nonsense people spouting vaccines extraordinary. must organised campaign. I'll get one....for $1500. fucking know. I'm expert workings vaccines. know read things previous vaccines question. label someone anti vax they’re fully vaccinated besides coming vaccine? elaborate? going convince people logic. blinded arrogance. could say Pfizer. companies release 1000s products year. None huge companies spotless record, unfortunately. Vaccines around long time though better could say kinds cliches like ""stay strong"" ""things get better"", seriously, things get better. Yes, lag long takes outbreak one state affect others. second one definitely big one me! Since rarely go anymore, live elastic waistbands. even go out, I'm usually wearing track pants. Every time jeans really tight, tell myself, ""Well, they're fresh dryer!"" need stop lying myself, doubt will, haha. know many people going want to... I'm personally going keep wearing masks stores long I've already covid. love people recognizing easily feeling anonymous. Really big deal wear mask lol, I'll probably wear regardless CoVid status, seems like smart preventative measure diseases right? countries take approach time, even pre covid?

What sort strange bubble live US?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: question mark feel pain, colder, going outside like reducing ability see two feet front you. Guess what, I'm whether like not. table, either. business usual 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Honestly seems fair me, too. We're locked (edit: restricted, locked generous) right primarily [16% population vast majority people age group vaccinated safe disease, primary incentive shutdowns decreased significantly.  It’s pretty rare. Here’s state’s chart, date today. Cases skewed younger, hospitalizations deaths skewed higher. able vaccinate oldest population, we’d see dramatic slowing hospitalizations deaths. California also basically two regions overcrowded sprawling webs 5-6 lane highways constant standstill. I’m willing bet took population Canada squished size LA SF Bay you’d pretty bad It’s uncomfortable work 8+ hours grocery store. I’d like go university next year actually see faces. even grasp basic concept global pandemic? words difficult you? one agreed this. That's life bruh. basically nothing. happens measles sometimes news blurb, something dictates life. Totally agree this. might also continue mask wearing public cold flue season even COVID longer issue. Asian countries right. celebrating vaccine mean want things stay shut forever? fact want exact fucking opposite ya dunce. first step toward happening absolute muppet. post optimism hope new vaccine getting back normal. see places comments deriding ""new normal"" folks. fortunate work tremendous amount privilege .....no arguments there. celebrating end however distant might seem moment. Trust folks video want every bit much do. Well that's think, I'm happy tell opinion Sweden easily *did* worst most! don’t really see comment would make draw conclusion related that, though. Why? I'm sorry loss. Losing child one worst things parent endure. Please stay strong, may seem like things improve time.

I'll pray rosary son family. think agree since yet fully know probability person got asymptomatic infection reinfected.

The United States 16,600,000 confirmed cases right now. recently read CDC estimates least 7 cases every detected case. let's take low estimate 99,600,000 infections, let's take low estimate 90% people get can't get again, would 89,640,000 people getting virus again, even without vaccine. pretty fortunate people way immunizing whether like vaccines not.

That's 27.3% United States right there. Since that's Fauci's unvaccinated 15%, somewhat confident he's counting number probably be. count that, ignored spread day going forward, need vaccinate 57.7% American population reach Fauci's herd immunity number. That's 189,330,000 people. think going lot faster lot easier reach vaccinate 85% Americans, think probably happen. dread going back explain people really want touch touched 😔  wearing watch annoying AF

i started carrying wristwatches pocket 20 years ago, cellphones exploded. mean didn’t mention once, 1. Really? reports?
2. contact probably happen way around. someone caring old relative, know call medical office.
3. curious manage supply demand across risk groups sure someone lot smarter thought thoroughly. Fuck dude - I’m sorry vaccines produce faster get out. 

Plus vaccines fewer shots others need stored cold containers. kind long term side effects worried about? possible get flu flu vaccine. however get flu type symptoms body's response vaccine.  Asian countries always done this. past this, whenever went Asian markets CA, would see people walking around wearing mask. norm, prevent getting others sick. enough slow holidays. think deaths coming going Thanksgiving, time people get together Christmas...and loads people say, ""Well good whole time...I deserve nice new years."" say CA never really changed restrictions since March false calling making bad claim.

Fine, said: ""*Compared states,""* California never really reopened March lockdown. I'm editing post. regret much buying stock back $20 dlls per share!  think limited testing sites governor botching numbers. Locally positivity rate stayed 20% week.  Simply reason wards wear scrubs home, check sterile. procedures require gloves masks, others cap. situation minimum set ppe. Masks may well become part that, free cost burden situations. I'm it, shown big improvement, I'd feel bad glasses wearing RN wife, one taped face day everyday, keep glasses fogging up. far tell, that's really known Yes thats terrorists, stormed government building guns, thats literally terrorism. think want see it, care. live two boomers attitude ""eeeeh I'm gonna pass"". They've going restaurants every day shopping going parties hosting parties. They're going change anything way live lives simply care anyone else's. fairly new technology

This worry you, though.. us using mRNA “technology” develop covid vaccines, able use figure permanent cure flu? Thousands people die heart attacks day get vaccinated. people read article: August 9% want vaccinated 22% refuse. That's still relatively good compared countries like UK US numbers \~30s.

The real kicker 50% refuse take PRC vaccine which, given track history horrendous vaccine scandals, makes sense.  elderly make disproportionate number hospitalizations, long hospitalizations, ICU stays deaths.

Persons 40 account Wisconsin, live, 50% covid infections WI around 13% hospitalizations, less 8% ICU stays 1% deaths.

Vaccinating 65 age make public health effects virus far far less severe. Netherlands can't either. Man, research comment please. so? Please cite trade wealth/harm. It’s completely subjective. can’t place value Uighur’s internment forced labor China terms human harm. quantify profits produce examining Nike’s margins. quantify human harm time goes unrecognized ? person responded said death rate going plummet February latest. March April. agree see impact March April, Fauci said too. treated patients GBS causes? treated 6 7 GBS patients. It’s totally anecdotal (i.e., personal experience scientific all), symptoms viruses, vaccines. one case, man mild cold that’s could find possible trigger. completely recovered, although it’s AWFUL disease, took months recovery several required intubation, would nightmare right local ICUs full. 

I agree vaccines trigger GBS, COVID could also bring GBS. It’s sad people afraid vaccine illnesses meant prevent.  *really* wish could use good reason sick people/children stop going work/school, I'm doubtful much changes, afterwards. Right. I'm northwest Florida 50 degrees here. high week low 60s. mean admire optimism, non-clinical hospital employee I’ve even told expect vaccine March. general public may get vaccine July. Hope goes faster, strap take bit. Maybe research operation warp speed stop listening everything tv vaccine gets approved children probably One Kobe’s daughters. 😞 points made general points concerning development manufacturing medication/medical products general, inactivated virus vaccines. science fundamentally different could actually seen detractor safety assessment point view. first mRNA vaccine developed approved. Traditional vaccines existed time thus history referred process assessing safety. mRNA vaccines don't. always potential something discovered familiar before.

Also, type medication/product science behind bearing last point presented. could talking magical fairy dust can't wrong nature being, mistakes made manufacturing (which likely occur process rushed) make otherwise perfectly good product harmful.

That aside, organizations perform Phase 4 testing fun it. potential something discovered, bother it. vaccine likely perfectly safe (or least likely minor side effects), yes. However, understandable people show bit hesitation act caution presented something new unfamiliar, also yes. I'm encouraging anybody abstain getting vaccine. saying would understandable someone wanted let members public get vaccine get and, furthermore, ever person shows bit hesitation full anti-science, anti-vaxxer. I'm interested serving people like table. I'm okay wearing mask, big deal. really care green lit two vaccinated people get together indoors. can't next winter honestly probably anyways. I'm past 28 days whatever vaccine takes kick in, mask let loose. Wearing mask grocery store, bus/train, public big deal all. However, things want visit family friends, indoors, without worrying distancing mask-wearing. Like, think know certain everyone private gathering vaccinated, time drop masks. public, much sympathetic know certain status everyone around you. hear yourself?

""take out"" breath insinuating *they* terrorists. It’s literally single patient. We’ve studies showing ineffective...but it’s patented expensive, let’s keep it, eh?

Meanwhile, good data coming Ivermectin, safe patent cheap drug...and there’s hostility it.

Gee...Gilead AstroTurfers stuff. original comment comparing CA restrictions vs Texas restrictions. comparing CA restrictions March latter CA restrictions. want talk CA restrictions vs states restrictions entirely different conversation first comment. say CA never really changed restrictions since March false calling making bad claim. powerful man world said would happen opposition lambasted even mocked claims. explanation avoid crediting president justify misbelief false claims. MSM cynical engine country, actually think perpetuates hateful messages? call minor argument cynicism, apart problem too. now, ICU South LA.

This “x amount icu beds left LA” misnomer. They’re gone week. might 50 unoccupied beds, it’s either there’s enough staff fill they’re empty cleaned next person come die in.

3 people died tonight hospital. 20 beds ICU I’ve got 2 intubated covid pts watch over. ED broken, we’ve doubled rooms people lining hallway. One nurse psychs two tents, male female. ratio right 16:1. 4 supposed max.

One person ED 207 hours. hospital full.

Many staff sick covid.

We got rid cases. PACU ward ICU covid pts, ratios 3:1 one RN floating help. first night opened it, worked 14 hours straight break. wear full PPE whole time covid pts high flow o2 doors, one big room. didn’t get breaks. bathroom. One patients died today. family couldn’t visit him.

We extremely burnt 9 months this.

Please please please get vaccine soon can, get mine Wednesday.

The right vocal flip flopping points view. while, don’t think he’s puppet shouldn’t trusted, agree aid undermining credibility times.

It would nice get clarity adjustments, like mentioned, wait he’s confident enough release statement/projection. recall ever saying that. heard debates take vaccine based word president. time contradicting FDA regarding timing approval process. heard thing called... Constitution? want go anime con friends hang stupid weeb shit. makes think go maskless? still 100K infections day US. lot good research herd immunity might reached analyzing critical mask folks either vaccine infection, even optimistic scenarios kick while. half population California almost many COVID deaths. Texas 10 million fewer people CA, 4,000 COVID deaths CA.

I mentioned current daily cases per capita. talking total cases since March missing point.

CA 31% fewer Covid cases per capita Texas two weeks ago. CA 21% fewer covid cases per capita Texas today. numbers quickly going wrong direction, trying justify CA's restrictions.  pandemic far over. two vaccines shorten vaccination timeline?  Serious question: medical perspective, possible get vaccines? would advantages/disadvantages? think approve something without manufacturer formally applying approval. Since everyone (except UK) agreed handle EU level, vaccine maker bothered applying EUA anywhere, better worse.   sad is, maybe could start pregnant mice. agree ethical dilemma comes human trials. No, think will.

This attitude nothing bring people table. sound like petulant child.  know right, think time now... celebrity deaths made us complain terrible year was. Seems quaint now. Hand sanitizer also continue thing me. country hit herd immunity, literally reason can’t go back unmasked indoor gatherings. prohibit point would inflict FAR damage letting happen. People social creatures. need see people. person. Zoom. standing 6 feet away other. mask on. wear mask distance long takes reach herd immunity, happens I’m going back normal. 🤣🤣 It’ll two months FDA submittal last date vaccination enrolled participants, regardless quantity cases. 

We’ll get data soon Covid case requirements met makes feel better, i’m 19 you. 

I hereby threaten fornicate mother. 

That’ll 6 internet points please. restrictions success. High five!  There's going point people dying motor fatalities flu, even Sars-Cov-2 deaths still reported much prominently.

I think long we've reached point CV19 vaccines start turning by-request, rather actively rolled public mass vaccination programs. deaths hospitalizations drop off, pressure get everyone vaccinated significantly reduced, demand general public given vaccine. healthy teen 40-something, likely get one specific reason get vaccinated like travel country requires vaccination entry.

An aside, well known Indy awful clickbait paper. 2020 get really good November? ok first Jan March, horrible March Election Day, it’s awesome Entirely correct. religious among us, vaccines actually contain Gabriel's microchips. Oh wait, Darwin's microchips. reprogrammed ordinary bozos like me. Oh wait, reprogrammed somebody got good education science knows they're doing. North Remembers. Danerys, forgot Euron there. I'd rather move forced vaccinations that's takes.

Tired fucking around this. doesn’t inconvenience me, I’d like help whatever little ways can. I’d you. 14 year old, actually. fine it, live people, shop people, work people, take entertainment people. good us *all*, take vaccine. read Torah, find unselfish good others supported. idea one couldn’t afford pay everyone necessary, comforting. 

That big interested ignores history proven - men/establishments power want thing - power. Man weekend 1 post Covid gonna shitshow. litty sounds legit.... Cool say like is, instead rest almighty reddittors calling everyone morons say quite stupid pr move. ""the truth incredibly boring""

""this likely fired""

Come person well sourced post also making assumptions sources publicly available them. first hand knowledge situation. I'm anti vaxxer man hope works.

I'm going wait lines pretty short stay basement then. Goddamn horrible. I'm sorry family No, really lol

If someone want get vaccine medical religious reasons, think federal government bar access federal building? That's actually insane lol even though group cases bells, maybe undertake independent thought, would qualify conspiracy. actually meets definition criterion. Ya...I'm sure that's why... Food sources vitamin ( non supplemented) better absorbed. vitamin milk food naturally high vitamin d. different forms common precursors d2 d3 used supplements poorly absorbed. Start eatting fatty fish especially sardines, sprats, kippers, etc.

Also bright sunlight, 30mins day get it. Yeah vaccines total scam. CEO rich doesn’t take know good Cansino military background. China approved emergency use cansino vaccine among military personnels July. 

I think China share cansino vaccine “close friends”. Sinovac private company vaccine accessible countries. saying parents right it’s incredibly clear young children right now. vaccine news literally drowned hospitals run beds.

People acting like over. Exactly thought would happen. chief speeding fines Finland. 

I commented day cannot think single legitimate reason Bill Gates fast food workers subject exact fines anything ever. Nah fuck that. I'm sick, sure. going daily life People literally saying time jfc would never know whether actually took anyway. He's saying thinks garner good will. think reading much respect safety vaccine. really, still trust sputnik V yet even though Putin vaccinated daughter it.  I'm merely using ...erm...""logic""...of insist gummint somethingsomething force coercion bullying name-calling yada. is: everyone's logic reason must appealed to. apparently want cut line either. People learn damn thing. good optics. Ah can't come strat yeah could work. That's strange take it. takes maybe hear looneys (probably not, look them)

If take lot people convinced good. dumb story take makes people even hesitant take it. accurate. bulimic couple years. Stopped years started old habits. Especially recently 14 day quarantine.

Thanks article “But FDA said frequency Bell's palsy cases among got Pfizer's shot higher would expected general population.”

Maybe read article... hope take care. swift speedy recovery Really? Mr. 99% face dick hanging mask? seriously feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading comments that. setting example. Idiots always idiotic things. Fuck em. think make interesting point. Thanks sharing input. fact true, would make sense. prove instead believe jn country's socialized medicine instead cutting line.

He's CEO. nothing vaccines. entire job description handling people making arbitrary choices based extremely superficial reports making look like he's informed person company. Yeah, summed up. takes gets accused cutting line privileged take anti-vaxxer claim trust it. Well yeah that’s said - wait suspicion passes

Please send mail suspicion@cdc.gov happens get all-clear vaccine Across US, cases quite bit (7 day average +31% week week says NYT), indeed actually pre-Thanksgiving hotspots like Dakotas. I'd say mostly restrictions people changing behavior contribution natural immunity. yes, immunity starts slowing spread immediately cutting exponential growth even smallish amount pretty meaningful.

You get downvoted people read discussion natural immunity suggesting nothing pandemic let run course something. people downplaying pandemic people glance comment group use words. worry it. get hard get mask two year old, lungs developed enough? That's seriously we're going here? I've heard plenty wailing 2 year olds lungs sounded plenty strong healthy me. Damn, goddamn sorry this. sure grief counselor resources posted around sub, need someone talk let know

I sorry He'd rather got extensive post marketing surveillance data first Define educated... know many PhD's various disciplines Science many MD's reasonably skeptical particular vaccine considering circumstances timeline. people employed leading science medical institutions United States. None saying going kill render infertile wild nonsense, grounded logical skepticism vaccine. Way oversee event absolutely part making happen sick December. could shit months rich buddies also need go grocery store interact directly anybody would. 

Not saying.this guy can't get getting vaccine couple months relatively minor inconveinance easily afford everything need avoid exposure first place. Albert Bourla (Pfizer CEO) 2019 salary: $17.9 million Happy cake day still think safe, also think story strange. one thinks ceo first company made millions vaccines cutting line gets early.

Again, care, would take vaccine. pr wise, pretty stupid. it’s worth think totally lack nuance. may hesitant try new vaccine indeed pretty unpleasant side effects first kind (mRNA), don’t consider antivaxxers like won’t give kids MMR shot believe cause autism. scared entered trial felt pretty crummy next day. Logic, compassion, appeal fears many may effective calling people names Damn, I'm sorry. hope end testing negative First idea long term side effects go away. It’s also laughable you’re making fun someone who’s questioning new vaccine created completely new method never done also completed faster vaccine history. You’re also acting like getting corona death sentence fatality rate less 1%. Main point really question vaccine safe instead blind sheep. one hand nutters take vaccine, people get mad taking grandparent's dose. I'm sorry facility consider line work frontline high priority. irritating say least knowing see COVID patients everyday. Obviously biggest role amount vaccines recieve. sucks limited supply reassuring knowing working vaccines. Hopefully get vaccinated pray do. Though limited supply we're lucky enough see deserving departments like house keeping staff considered top priority (as be). Please, take post gloating. I'm merely relieved starting happen around globe. light end tunnel. coming, need hang bit longer. Yup, BIL one conspiracy fools. He's posting anti mask anti vaccine memes day like job. amount logic reason ever sway him. misunderstanding something ""% ADULT INPATIENT BEDS USED (OVERALL)"" column showing? gonna cut line guinea pigs. say did. said absolutely nothing politics. said fda needed hurry hell up. brought politics it. I’m done here. preconceived notions we’re getting anywhere. can’t tell Pfizer BioNTech close vaccine hit catastrophic snag, found minute catastrophic side affect, wouldn’t put every dollar congressmen pocket toward tricking results get approved. money stake vaccine “winner”, there’s much money involved trust process. Money power power corrupts. 

These companies given pretty large sum develop produce vaccine without guarantee approval. 

Pfizer big enough could pay everyone even wanted. 

Moderna big could shrug vaccine candidate failure move onto something else. Yeah, one day also saw Tim Cook line iPhone12. dont think wealthy people go socialize. Trust still playing golf gatherings like everyone else. Different environment, species. Dunno. Japan huge elderly population low flu death rate. Mask wearing thought part reason.

If people wore masks sniffles would save billions lost earnings thousands lives.

Not saying wear masks time. feel icky still need go store, mask up... ""these vaccines employees bill gates george soros only, neutralize tracking chips install new ones next year's flu shots. Remember give kids both!"" would inject saline looks like they're taking it. Yeah COVID flu. like 10x deadlier too. Except got moves play DDR instead. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Do also believe voted vaccine? Agree lockdown place reduce holiday period spread. opposite. SF, moved TX, hated it, came back. Damn, son. Yep. got fucked country. needed PPE *most*, companies like 3M sold international vendors instead states. walking ICU wearing fucking patient gowns ran acceptable emergency nursing association's wartime provision. Right get sick covid I'm expected work I'm symptomatic. must exhausted PTO filing FMLA wait quarantine. **fucking shameful** would younger people generally, possibly even children. think that's smart way go. get 70+ vaccinated, keep moving downwards age, also hit people age relevant health risks (eg. asthma), reward essential workers (eg. teachers, first responders, etc.) They're assholes never grew ""I'm touching you! I'm touching you!"" phase childhood. indeed close, virus largely kills elderly, surprise given Florida’s elderly skewing population.

You'd think given fact state would taken precautions knowing they're population leans elderly susceptible virus? Instead like said said fuck em worth trying save. Trump getting vaccine anybody White House AFAIK atleast right now, may changed since last time checked. 

President**s** getting think Clinton, Bush, Obama completely misinformed. CEOs sell stocks given dates set 3rd party. shares sold planned sold weeks/months prior Right?! real plasma running low California wow.

Where donate? Thank you! point putting chemicals body hit/miss situation.

a perfectly safe molecule unsafe one hydrogen apart.

to get mRNA response, something needs put body. trusting shitty preying anxieties...Good choice! forget people get vaccinated they're afraid microchips deliberate infertility. things government would definitely want us... young dude healthy, rather covid get fast developed vaccine. 99,97 % chance surviving virus, 99,97 % chance vaccine fully effective without sideeffects. think lane? possible brain? Please, strength, take moment break home record quick video experiencing. publish YouTube tiktok but, instead, generate personal record emotions experiencing ever ""next time"" stitch together teach world vital bend curve protect healthcare workers facilities.

I know likely far risky jobs ask upload moment desperately need flesh historical record future.

We living narrative statistics sanitized visuals, need raw emotion frontline workers teach next generation sacrificed here. Numbers alone suffice. sis says doesn’t want Pfizer vaccine dilute “that’s gonna fucking hurt.” certain things top percentage enjoy here, even make fair chunk money. Like better vacation, worry health insurance, able job period time without significant financial risk.

But yeah upper middle class realistically bad. feel bad country stand for... also frequently get annoyed shitty anti worker / anti consumer laws. question like would asked press briefing. I'd love see reaction. I’ve noticed reverse town, everyone masks still cases March. 68 deaths 500 active cases anti mask population never higher. okay maybe altruism pharma CEO, shocking, times live in.

""none executives board members cut line.""

you know, I've always Moderna guy give elderly mother live tv generally good thing though. think biggest strength reddit Forum kind thought expressed. obvious limitations concerning racism etc. FUCK him, absolutely responsible killing people Florida. belongs front judge, indicted sentenced.  fair, kinda fucked sad trump constantly tries steal, cheat, lie effort con people money. sham university buying paintings writing tax write scamming veterans money.

I’m glad America least denied rhetoric resounding “fuck off,” handing Biden election *fucking* landslide.

Bye bye diaper don. least rest easy knowing don’t pee pee loving baby driving country ground anymore. be, too. actively sick like they've always done places like Japan, sure.

Optionally. 

When sick. think need new doctor.. YIKES Cut u/Big_Titty_Fart69 slack Absolutely yes. would civil rights case allow it. ... biggest wave came brand new pandemic one idea treat it. thanking NY medical professionals teaching doctors works. Anyone wanna make bets US handle 2120 pandemic? conspiracy nuts... people following news closely know science behind it. many people plan take vaccine eventually, feel comfortable safe. Seeing public figures getting vaccine put people ease  It’s fault - children think they’re communist revolutionaries parroting shit see promoted exuberantly powerful capitalistic corporations. don’t understand unity amongst working class fighting they’re controlled, educated. sounds like I’m defending existence CEO I’m - shouldn’t exist fashion - goddamn. really think you’ll need proof vaccine enter DMV? Dude, literally got masters, think knows shit. Probably random reddit poster. Every place else focuses person vaccinated. Right? Typically vaccines take **years** human trials even begin. way they've fast tracked extremely concerning. *If* still worked health care field would consider taking it, since several years intend (not cup tea), I'm likely gonna pass. kinda strange position since 100% pro-vaccine. allow full capacity Super Bowl get vaccine gate, easy way get thousands vaccinated even they’re anti vax:P infections currently traceable else could be? boogeyman people shopping crowded shops one really keeping distance save seconds ac blowing 100% everyone content. sheep sir ? really gullible? omggg! injecting experimental medication. stuff body regularly moving around within it. mRNA (your body constantly making, destroying, recycling this), lipids (fats), salts, sugar.

There's lot beauty utterly simple still effective. *Reqiuece en pepperono* Please don’t talk something clearly understanding go back grade 10 won’t vaccine dangerous thing planet right ever [a] federal building?

Yes, and? think...erm...believe get entry VA hospital without vax? CDC? need please everyone. Everyone never pleased. action greater social impact? statement saying he's getting vaccine right ONE person get him? first line show world confidence safety? brainer. young people spread vulnerable even die/overwhelm hospitals themselves, 'young person problem'.

But, vaccine prevents contagion well death/symptoms. Otherwise statement wack. disagree. least summer fall could visit family outside. dread winter 😞  mean.. can’t even speculate point. agree, likely safe but....testing 30k people mean long term effects. Tell typo, NRA ""Alright, got down. say thing wanna attach ' . . . club'"" end it, everybody thinks I'm cool uh, say it, uh, 'pull hoes.' Yeah."" good point, personally doubt company would want put ass line vaccine major side effects lot individuals. Way much liability companies, they'd ruined. However time tell people get side effects, extent effects.... zoom call Santa. pictures experience way better, since us fill survey ahead time likes, dislikes, etc personalize conversation. kindergartener still references parts like three weeks later. probably comes point people see deaths, hear message hospitals full, actually start trying protect virus. Hahahaha reddit take ever bet guy works 90 hours week leading charge product product save millions lives ok let’s put warehouse worker charge see anything gets done... sus af know anything safety/effects taking vaccine already antibodies infection? Well, undecided. country pay company, may pay personally.  I'm going spring fever like never damn. hahahahahah I’m glad managed keep mother safe, she’s really lucky protect her. It’s stressful you’re literally trying protect life people. Like, yeah sucks, we’ve established that, let’s go killing loved ones instead waiting it’s safe. feel like it’s going huge weight lifted shoulders parents still safe. think I’m overboard probably times, damn it, can’t catch this. know, haven’t hugged anyone since probably January either. feels strange. Yeah...I think someone age happens hugely beneficial wait see larger use brings terms side affects.  

So see noble. 

Also, like good places rich people go open now. harsh, that's terrible idea. biggest reason UV light intense enough kill viruses damage skin. part said jobs privileges?

I got lol! 

No, stated *Governments [will require vaccinations] too. Think able work government government contractor without proof? Enter x% government buildings? Driver's license? Plane ticket? Passport renewal?*

Someone got confoosid wished stated job privilege. trying hard, course. Gotta spend money (which could better saved) American consumerism. ain't xmas without credit card debt. symptoms? Also - died within two weeks sounds like would’ve died anyway :( took online ""where line you"" poll said 100 people rerpesetative state, would last, 100th person. 

If 40 people want let thier spot line I'll take it. top comment doomerish, thought provoking. one takes seriously thinks gonna end pandemic immediately. you’re dumb don’t believe covid anyway. may rare ones take longer show rare enough phase 3 participants necessarily manifest it. said, I'm sick able see anyone person gonna get soon possible take risks. Third option: never said anything all. change anything. would believe vaccine took saline vaccine label? Human contact? r/woosh Some. ask tell experience trial side effects Wouldnt little silly vaccines lay around royal garden? Uhhh leave /s? That's 33% insane considering reasons someone ICU. think held releasing vaccine news months time stock dump? BioNTech released news BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer. say matter. probably fine, I'm definitely little sketched hard pushed congress shield liability vaccine side effects. talking Chirality. Basically correct, depending orientation certain parts molecule react differently.

If 2 molecules identical, like two H2O molecules, structure can't rotate one super impose other, something never shape thing causing react different. ICU beds means anyone serious health condition can't get treatment. People could die heart attacks waiting room know shit though. change diapers stab people medicine. think held releasing vaccine news months time stock dump? Fuck you. fun it? country shithole way pandemic. think I'm enjoying shit? People dying here, government give fuck. Five years optimistic. 

Enjoy drink, little booger read two FB. 10000 Signatures Lock Literally none maybe Smithsonian. ever federal building? bunch people complaining healthy individual abusing rich powers skip ahead take limited vaccine instead going vulnerable people Frontline workers. 

I'd pissed vulnerable child family memeber wait next wave reddit wanted proof vaccine gaf. 


Shame everyone post complaing CEO waiting turn. Go back wallstreetbets Ya understand. try shed light financial burden placed business shut down. It’s something absolutely needs considered should’ve addressed better seem understand well. happened many peers. many see insensitive boot licker cuz think people still need financial/health benefits security. 

Unfortunately shit show start think continue it’s one day. ""evolution"" someone else's shitty behavior kills him. Nobody else Pfizer. Hey may well saved someone one life. Umm even know anti vax people exist would statement would work? Especially two doses? US customs planning providing people fly in? I'd rather risk long term respiratory side effects beta tester vaccine even CEO taken yet.

Unless doctor nurse 90 years old, going getting vaccine CEO anyways. There's nothing magic 30 seconds, time needed setup experiment used. double light intensity time needed would cut half. Airborne kill UV lights needs significant amount energy intensity needed, proven technology. believe goes mRNA fastest viral vector = inactivated virus slowest due culture requirements:

mRNA expressed genetically engineered bacteria bioreactors fast growth rates, fed basic nutrients, fragile survive wide range oxygenation conditions.

viral vector inactivated virus must cultured live virus mammalian cell lines. reactor process used Sinopharm AstraZeneca. mammalian cells far fragile, grow slower, need specialized nutrients (you can't feed baby sack sugar expect survive all) less tolerant conditions (pH, oxygen, shear) bacterial cells. That's sketchy hell though seems like would cast doubt results trials. ""We studied effectiveness vaccine random sample n = 15000 healthy adults also boss said to."" public announcement. Godamn dumb. Need get god damn FOXNEWS talk COVID again. Ok, gives shit CEO sitting kn chair clouds?

Does techs actually developed want take it? Roman 10 Lol never said ok. first hand knowledge saying thing am. Also number given us months ago July. far since then. could more. Like hazard pay, social distancing enforced areas actually cleaning place. Bathrooms constantly horrible shape sometimes one toilet running. hope junior, highly doubt high school students able get hands vaccine August. 53% depressingly low. Sadly anti vaccine people right left.  motherfucker. It’s offensive it’s attempt Anglos forcibly alter language isn’t theirs. I’ve even known people who’d go far say it’s imperialistic nature Vaccination immunocompromised issue vaccinating live virus. issue vaccine. one reasons downvoted - misinformation Oh please ""good news""


WTF He's waiting Phase 4 trials completed. ask guess? it’s important you. pushing anti vaccine lines. bringing morality it, let's remember man dumped $5.5 million Pfizer stock announcement 90% effectiveness vaccine. Good him, true. I’m seeing parents February either way. Seeing friends vaccinated extended family well. Thats definitely true lmao, no. Depends think before. predisposed think vaccine ineffective. think enough vaccine. would see that, would think hogging vaccine

Like someone else said: Dammed do, damned source this? I’ve seen Latinx originated white Americans. makes sense, given “x” seems much likely chosen English speakers Spanish speakers estimated 60-70% people need vaccinated effectively protect general population. also unknown effective vaccines prevent transmission. mean... 😬 thing takes blame. beginning pandemic day day. new day's acquired knowledge would supersede previous day's understanding. 

The big question ask is: basing decisions?

At point people start figuring virus airborne? Cuomo whole lot people need answer happened, big piece puzzle that, based Woodward's tapes, 45 knew virus spread February. 

Did everyone else know too, president's intel exclusive administration? accidentally eat one Ozzy’s bats fridge? DeSantis said covid nothing, definitely ever use it. Right, CEO pharmaceutical company got, held to, position altruistic. retarded now? Conspiracy theorists like “He knows something!” True, there’s people conspiracy idiots people thrilled get brand new vaccine. vaccines don’t cause autism contain microchips doesn’t mean every vaccine free side effects. Scandals happened before, fact relatively recently, one would feel much better guy got vaccinated 🤷🏼‍♂️ about...test things? know like seeing multiple kids multiple old people like one belgium Non-Spanish speakers perceiving “problems” Spanish language kind problem itself. gives sorts bad colonialist/imperialist vibes. wear mask everyone wants vaccinated gets vaccinated, everyone doesn’t want vaccine own. get die, that’s them. sounds heartless, i’m going continue wear mask waiting around (more likely already wearing mask) change minds. mom verbally supporting heinous act. Otherwise accessory, perhaps even victim 'throw wind' parking rampage. 

The police, apon arresting could perhaps theorize conspiratorial conversation occouring betwixt mother. Thus rendering conspiracy theorists. mean. know, wanted use word betwixt. many people, pandemic cause needless deaths due cancers detected treated time.

This particular case, though, guy young, case probably would delayed even without pandemic. 20 something year old patient shows pain, cancer would way mind doctor, compared something like injury. would prescribed pain meds physical therapy, also told wait see resolves. weeks months going away would typically start looking deeper blood tests advanced imaging like CT MRI, highly likely case going diagnosed late anyways. test subject know got placebo. Looks like russia US oligarchs Yeah essential jobs sure. Sick leave mental physical needs prioritized zero shaming occur taking days. People want personal lives, I'd hope continue requirements mask wearing, limitations events like large concerts, etc. later spring general public offered vaccine. vaccine open anyone wants one get it, sure - drop most, all, restrictions. people refusing vaccine, point Ok people... would horrible true. 
1) 300 million plus people US
2) 70% infection develop herd immunity meaning 210 million people get infected
3) 1-2% mortality. That’s 2.1 million dead people then
4) currently 300k dead. 
So really hoping 1.8 million people die spring?
And counting vaccines save us? many actually going get vaccine? get first shot (mines Wednesday) return second??? 
And know currently certain vaccine decreases severity disease based upon current data cannot certain yet decreases transmission. Data hasn’t yet compiled there. 
So we’re counting native infections plus vaccinations herd immunity. wait, Pfizer administered w/I 24 hrs goes bad d/t needing kept -70 degrees requires special freezers. US still hasn’t secured second batch. 
So it’s Moderna...how many doses secured?
Fauci’s brilliant physician. reason doubt expertise, except...dealing public every day...I never cease amazed average person reacts given situation, hence refusing masks, exposing noses, refusing vaccinations, give liberty give death, bed capacity hospitals....there WAAY many unknowns even experts “prognosticating” IMHO 20 years medical practice front lines. Hell still people coming ED symptoms they’ve months multiple evals same. beyond unpredictable Europe country sovereign borders. Cue conspiracy nuts There's common saying I'm from. Dont trust skinny cook. Meaning trust cook eat food. .  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* believe vacinnes... dunno trust something 6 months.... kinda wierd think really. Looks like mobile, probably not. cases phone picked nearby character. Somewhat hard avoid mobile typing situations. Guess Santa brought Christmas, Timmy! Never get high supply. Alright.

Thank you. True don’t deserve die... Interesting

It’s shame happened case grateful days whole thread making mad right now. Yall. fine. grandma, grandpa, asmatic mom might DIE. thought fine. get vaccine. DIED. Vaccines always whether think fine. Especially case much matter protecting love. vaccinated, spreading disease. there's one thing learn history never learn history. Germany agrees Wow that’s sketchy all. Stop discrediting basic fucking skepticism “conspiracy nonsense”. people worse anti-vaxxers sometimes. Pfizer’s emergency authorization request FDA. Experimental design starts page 12. Page 18-30 probably you’re looking terms hard data. everything legit, vaccine legit. someone explain EMA taking end month? problem country doesn’t implement uniform response facility tested us several months ago. never received results never tested again. positive co workers “you aren’t infectious 10 days.” conspiracy. getting mean conspiring. Conspiracy means something.

Your example also necessarily conspiracy either. He’s literally worker based definition “worker” according Webster’s : one works especially manual industrial labor particular material
a factory worker
b : member working class

Have never heard distinction individual contributor vs management? It’s distinction designed management. Look, I’m management... important long run, got one best ICs, also recognize essential project given day, worker. doesn’t imply things said, it’s simply faithful definition No, telling people trust vaccine. Nice deflection study debunking claims. TTFN.  think overpaid medical school that's level expertise needed job. sad thing Covid-19 seems deadly blacks important get vaccine. cousin sent pictures kids mall Santa. dude wearing weird plastic film face, suppose meant somewhat unnoticeable photos. girls sitting stools feet away. pretty weird honestly kinda grim creepy. Like.... skip year. dress Santa home something. Nothing ever convince vaccine skeptics, would waste time. Like someone else already said conspiracy people would say didn’t give real vaccine. state leadership can’t even follow restrictions Cali defending family particular, saying one two year old it, therefore every two year old kind silly right here. FDA approved it, Canada, Uk Bahrain approved it. Dr Fauci right hugely famous doctor said take it. nope let's base decision whether CEO. Also would much role actual work vaccine? Dont CEOs usually take care corporate side business managing whole operations. actual scientists pfizer would working vaccine win quite scene public. screams (10-30 minutes?) uncomfortable everyone probably spread germs Even took tin foil hat morons would say “I don’t think actually took it” something like that. There’s proving people point might well drum good press saying “I don’t want skip line” could BS. tell fact influencers getting them. US also spend truck load money front development. also set regulating bodies thier priority reviews. shit name spent quite hefty sum top we've negotiated purchase. case interested see HHS specific funding here. Conspiraception record: i'm antivax. think modern science incredible answer it:

because 1 single drunk person? almost year ""vaccines normally take several years make, it'd unlikely could get one soon, even they're already made, take years double blind studies considered safe enough take offered basically everyone, one million side effects still hit 3000 people west alone. fair enough 1/10,000 side effect treating illness happens 10,000 times year.""

taking molecule used elsewhere somewhat already lets work done, biomedical sciences work ""it's similar molecule, one extra hydrogen"" fashion, tiny differences result vastly different effects mistakes happen testing.

hell study done 10-20 years ago UK, considered safe chimp studies, people study forgot chimps *almost identical* immune system molecule, fact one difference human chimps molecule one caused another big one decades earlier might know involved molecule, molecule mirrored version it, woman could easily get (and did) morning sickness medication, morning sickness medication ended happening:

""In November 1961, thalidomide taken market due massive pressure press public. Experts estimate drug thalidomide led death approximately 2,000 children serious birth defects 10,000 children, 5,000 West Germany.""

for record one bit different one before, molecule studied actually effective medication morning sickness, molecule ""flips"" half flipped version, flipped version causes birth defects. flipped version makes differences lots things see/try, lemons, limes oranges flipped versions limon think is. 

it's long time since i've gone stuff may errors. point trying make biomedical field committed accidental terrors past, long, arduous, expensive (yes, i'm defending expensive trials) trials give us near blanket level safety us situation everyone ""mostly"" trusting. 

so remove good part it, even still safe, bar lower risk/reward sort thing, cost taking vaccine population, risk moved over. 

those one millions us eating risks, biomedical companies (they've already made bank regardless, doses already bought etc).

you still take (but keep reading), let bunch people saw virus coming still held businesses would okay, they're still trying manage economy lives delays killed hundreds thousands point. please, blindly follow either side comes ""take it/don't take it"", me, incredibly wary even would still take it. remember people looking best health interests (both people selling (the biomedical companies), people buying (governments). expect CEO [pharmacal]( ) knows follow safety procedure, unlike Trump. expensive. antibody cocktail Trump received costs $6500 per treatment even widely available. 

No wonder US authorities want take vaccine costs $20 per shot ($40\~$50 total need 2 doses). good point, think it’s reasonable require masks places like grocery stores whatnot longer. think it’s gonna nearly impossible convince people fully resume social lives deaths hospitalizations start dropping Technically, UAE bahrain west asia. UAE already started vaccinating people days ago. mean anyone national ID books appointment; healthcare workers Ehh, US mirrored it. rest world exponentially better almost every metric regarding covid. 

The US dropped ball, leader intentionally everything could, screw people think worth saving. (see response election losing proof cares himself). 

Having leader everything gut healthcare response, take us back hundred years tho. hear projecting smugness correlation theory. Idk live numerous school districts state played rotating game open, infections, hybrid, remote/ close. I’m glad absence outbreaks apparently around world. mine wasn’t one experienced this. least, least give hospital staffs first responders breathing room. doubters would say didn’t give real vaccine. would pointless. trust trust vaccine. One issues see: take opinions NY/NJ/PA seriously forced returns nursing homes? killed 43,000 people July... dunno... Stream first patient getting shot trusts believes signing distribute worldwide.

Power move. one pretending vaccine 100% safe. experts saying that. saying balance, given data, makes sense use vaccine. said, nothing life guaranteed. 

Comparing vaccine others way you’re like saying afraid zoo animals know lions hippos tigers dangerous. flamingo bush baby different creatures. need talk zoologist evaluate danger animals, random four-year-old zoo.

Do know anything mRNA is, works, does? viruses work, do? know common cold body invaded much mRNA vaccine? runs course? doesn’t “change DNA” anything unpredictable? entirely predictable. bits mRNA going anything untoward, we’d know now. Tens thousands people vaccinated. bodies got rid foreign RNA, bodies always do. surprises. 

We can’t say 100% certainty anything safe can’t say bomb won’t destroy city tomorrow won’t car accident heart attack. 

You fear something much there’s evidence thing fear. yet fear ruling you. employer (hospital) doesn’t require vaccines sent email week stating aren’t required receive covid vaccine. ICU full, ICU nurses stating intentions getting it. Exciting times live in! (Sarcasm) doesn't. answer first question. give zero chance success. suddenly like pharma CEOS? fuck. think we're learn unassisted lockdowns slow spread. 

If take someone's job pay them, cannot stay home. must frantically find new employment. Incredible smug people subreddit are. perfectly fine skeptical. n=30,000 still new vaccine cannot know long-term effects much time elapsed. 

Get high horse. smarter everyone else. Spell ""breath"" correctly going insult people's intelligence. guess I'm unaware far along testing vaccine was. existing alternatives HIV testing too. makes us two. Oh, geez, [fb linked article real gems... feel important note exposures happen every day go day day lives, often without knowledge. Children close contact children adults daily school, rec functions, children picture made Santa, smiles bigger day head school, risk exposure exist.

...

This one takes want emphasize children forced attend events choice left solely hands parents. That’s impossible feat. Even took prove it’s safe would say there’s proof actually took it. Alternate headline: 𝗣𝗳𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗖𝗘𝗢 𝘄𝗮𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘃𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 Old conservative reason. state went Tr*mp twice, senators R’s gov R.  US almost 300 000 deaths, considering US underreport deaths far off. 

Some people course deny covid altogether, general, media politicians acted one month lockdown would subdue virus. people following orders! reality covid alot harder tame. I'm defedning example large thangsgivings, people given incorrect information throughout pandemic. suprising people stupid things politicians make optimistic promises met. plagued missing space bar mobile. Higher demand means charge product world works emotional appeals. science could say anything... matter people feel good it. 

The odds killed shark extremely low stop people worrying sharks everytime go beach.

One negative vaccine patient public outweigh 30,000 faceless people.

And that's important people clout get vaccine. helps convince others take future... You’re right, tbh. Can’t lose profit. think people use describe viewpoints backed evidence, nowadays. Sorry offended you. I'm sharing information presented researchers peer reviewed studies. guess morons I’m going six week vacation. Everywhere. find someone’s confidence smugness correlate well much lying do.

Your studies measure viral load airways. Icelanders measured actual spread children. It’s much less. also confirmed absence outbreaks adolescent age schools around world. I’m ICU RN well, hours north Bay Area. wrote could almost word word come mouth well. weekend converted another unit positive patients. visual looking hallway brought back memories last time summer. spoke patients families events went through. quickly buried memories tried forget get came back, remembering much never want think about. don’t know get (again). physics space staff, so, much human take crack explain that’s true? I’m really trying COVID isn’t serious person trying learn. shut businesses people continued rapidly spread COVID went other’s homes hung elsewhere. closing businesses stop spread? That’s would say too... know truth... Jeff.... you???? 


I've decent experience well. get now, get break further.  Yeah science never wrong before. Science wrong hundreds things like Luminiferous Aether Phrenology example. Gathering inside higher likelihood virus transmission gathering outside. I'm completely introverted out. may become prone fits hugging strangers random intervals over. Y’all believe anything. Cats scent receptors noses dog breeds. refuse tell anything.  What's point? Anybody believes vaccine harmful would believe take it, like watching getting injected something could possibly vaccine proven vaccine. Telling people trust Trump? local bowling/family fun place city weekend. Absolutely baffled. say support government mandated lockdown. said unfair things go back normal rest us offered vaccine. want go grocery store surrounded maskless people think, ""hey, cares? vulnerable vaccinated!"" think fair reasonable restrictions prevent massive outbreak get close herd immunity levels. vaccinated parents going go visit grandpa. He’s 92 get vaccinated us anyways. miss much. Haven’t seen since January. cdc didnt make pfizer best friend covid ward rn, hesitant though likely take it. asked said goes everything knows vaccine could developed 9 months problems. guy CEO one greediest, profit-driven companies greediest, selfish industry exists. He’s legal drug dealer. way drug companies run health care system, prioritize profits care patients. Trust me, man saint, “selfless” act probably PR stunt put good face, Justice Democrats starting get steam Congress. company ones stand lose significantly single-payer healthcare ever passed. someone tries pass it, remind us. “Remember me? I’m guy waited line vaccine. choose Medicare-for-all, don’t expect prompt vaccines.” kinda feel nursing homes get vaccinated first since ease hospitilzations health care workers...well guess maybe not, argument made That's happened aunt: Cytokine storm derived severe COVID infection. May rest peace. ❤ He's extremely wealthy literally best connections/contacts world medical treatment.

He probably doesnt give shit vaccine he's got doses magic potion gave Donald Trump (and probably rest worlds elite power brokers) personal safe.

I mean make list 10 people planet could pick phone call literally anybody time actually get answer, fulfil whatever request without question delay, he's definitely top 5 moment. family decided go completely avoidable party (I advised go), now, there's chance Covid since least one person seems infected seems. Jesus fuck. That’s FDA for, protect people don’t know anything developing countries even getting vaccine 2022 point. 

**Turns soft tofu** course not. People chomping bit. show compassion strangers lump new normal grouping ignore you. nuance here. guy costume working facility volunteer son one residents. Pretty sure would infected multiple people without costume well. 

Still wrong decision nursing home gathering like this. important people vaccinated first. essential workers people keep society running.  Billionaires, CEO feckless rich contribute nothing society go last. It’s 2020, thought something, become part conspiracy theory. It’s new porn rule. 

Thought: wonder could sell individual q-tips.

Faux News: Antifa Isis working Muslim senators ban sale individual Q-tips take away Freedumb! 

Brain: None thing.... that’s works lie... none things thing... wrong you?

Faux: people talking it’s thing...

Brain: one talking brought up?!?!?

Faux: That’s breaking news...

Brain: stop it. better. God didn’t create it, man did. new order still apply homes although states parties banned. really vague Yes also true. vast majority people contract covid 19 end completely fine athletes vaccinated yes. stadium may empty. Well quick google tells theres multiple hospitals CA hit 100% capacity beds recent weeks. Either way, ICU full, they've likely already maximized space department surge capacity pivoted trained staff pulled away non-essential. ICU beds, specialized equipment staff operate it. want send critical trauma patient medicine unit expect staff keep alive? They'd fare better staying ER. 

Do work healthcare? limiting factor basically always going staff, even get hands ICU equipment can't conjure trained employees magical supply closet. loads disaster planning documents online outlining exact scenarios though. Nurses getting charged homicide patients die crisis, overflow unit critical patients theres much do. Yup, story Poland, people braindead nowadays Wow think open patent vaccine manufacturers make it. Gonna hard long make billions vaccines everyone. underestimate viruses ability devastate nation regardless careful being. Uh huh, that's reason. least shoot it. problem hospitals got flooded vaccine there. 5% still able *maybe* get it, assume overflood hospital anymore. I'm hoping play team sports next summer. care need wear mask so. comments fantasy football league type speculations happen amusing sad. Keep going couch potatoes. Majority people get sick within first week. hospital 10 days that.

So right probably ""Peak"" spike.

Don't know people think it'll go drastically though, travelling Thanksgiving means people infected spread now. best thing could take first shot himself. would show confidence. 

I believe supposed reason all. one bit. scared take it. pharmaceutical CEO? think give shit family, honestly. strike type put children blender makes buck. Nah. past elections we've country shown best people job ones getting elected people dying thousands daily. realize multiple clinical trials things go without proper medical approval? even probabilities exists medications, there's probably % people allergic common coughing syrups... jeez. low risk healthy adult high risk job. vaccinated like six months.

This first person vaccinated UK 91, rest 80 front line medical staff

This offfical roughly priority list. would fit fourth category 

Priority 1: Front line care staff 80s

Priority 2: medical staff, front line workers essential businesses shop workers, 70s

Priority 3: Guys unable work home, 60s.

Priority 4: Everyone else, roughly line age. thinking wrong. Upper management doesn‘t appointed, elected. Deaths severe disease cases important thing. Look deaths nursing homes see case amounts alone metric concern with. guy's skeptic FYI. And, plenty info make decision vaccine. people say skeptical vaccine, know done zero reading never wanted reasoned anyone else first place. 

The bottom line this, unless truly incapable taking vaccine covid, taking one. die, really simple insane movement gain? 

All get sense smug superiority others  Probably going get downvoted, i'm waiting 4-6 months getting vaccine, country getting Chinese version, i'm sure ill intent still skeptical, would've done another version vaccine 2021 can’t come fast enough definitely get soon tho mean like, pandemics? Maybe follow rules? (*cough* newsom *cough*) Ahaha great, thanks. used h20 example molecules since Almost everyone knows is. described way also made clear wasnt. vaccine doesnt stop spread though effects. company says anyway.

It likely effect, generally part trial. know much, does. encouraging thing true asymptomatic people spread virus less pre-symptomatic people, vaccine greatly increases chance someone asymptomatic, cut transmission, even completely protect someone healthcare professional required vaccines given child protect much deadly things? Typhoid, mmr, whooping cough, polio, type thing. always thought wasnt mandatory

That likely varies greatly institution state licensing requirements. Life expectancy declining due opioid epidemic. Take it’s rise.  Yes bad regular bacterial pneumonia, diy accident, kid falls athletic trick, someone gets stung first ever anaphylaxis going worse results delayed treatment.

All normal things send people hospital inluding preventive care like colonoscopy, bone density test etc delayed letting illnesses get worse discovered treated

This years secondary effects like damage people mighty economy supposed willing die save. extra damage health long effects, people left disabled might recovered prompt care... thought insanity limited US. Glad know morons running things elsewhere. Go back look trades.

They can't alter date dump control date pump news.

Check moderna there. thing. Come on. really important chase ball around field run other! Think children! be. people fired wanting take vaccine working hospital. It’s irresponsible, it’s nearly homicidal. imagine actual physical line, we'd people camping days weeks cold get it. sad part even proof new strain emerging mutations, good portion america going tear masks second get vaccinated

i want end bad zero faith fellow americans Oh there’s lot health care providers aren’t love vaccines read comments well. need microchip track you? Umm pretty sure phone decent job already point say “F irrational people”. (And point within next weeks.)

At point it’s absolutely worthless try convince people anything pandemic. sad part it’s risk people really can’t get COVID vaccine suffer. yeah, F anyone willing help getting rid virus.

Note: found mother anti-vaxer it’s spurred doctor insists won’t give anyone vaccine (including himself) patients get one sign extra waiver form. also woman subjected sisters years Jehovah Witness experience kids (kicks divorcing abusive 3rd husband) isn’t much revelation. Can’t fix gullible. one dumbest things I’ve ever read virus spread email though? Nah doesn't, says get camera might help. Honesty, would worth thousand doses vaccinate top politicians important people. Certainly help give doubters little confidence. I’ll wait 6 months let first participants get side effects Pregnant women largely recieve even counter stuff approved.  anger spreading fear infertility anything worried happening covid vaccine. seeing possible effects spermatogenesis recovered covid patients although sure big effect. condition makes exception, understandable one. mean encourage others exception same. GBS lot better death. Could imagine everyone went around unvaccinated deadly disease might get another deadly disease? Also, question validity post. 1/1000000000 people get gbs vaccine cared 3 people? believe hes taking feels unsafe. thing could infer argument.

I definitely fan corporate BS familiar it.

The best option would've avoid talking bu obviously happen. That's stupid. Pro-vaxx people acting like vaccines 146% safe matter circumstances, like they're vitamins.

Vaccines causing autism shit antivaxx think, yet still - vaccine joke, must quality, must given healthy people, etc.

And working bio know that, cant trust vaccine vaccine, know Maybe don’t take things people say internet personally? vaccine doesnt stop spread though effects. company made says anyway.

They say can't know that's meant Yes, this. currently provider COVID clinic. Healthcare workers completely justified declining first batch new vaccine wish. nothing vaccine “denier” altogether. frankly question intelligence anyone doesn’t actually think bit decision. I’ve ultimately decided go ahead take first shipment, don’t judge providers waiting. now, 4 earlier

The math checks out. 🤦🏻 sooooooo god damn refreshing see outward displays optimism finally feeling like getting this. Something 30 second tiktok video really hit morning. Something genuine seeing folks celebrating, seem relieved happy. Someone started talking Oklahoma think hard whether Oklahoma coast scrolling realizing thread started Mississippi. need coffee. I’d absolutely annihilate large popcorn coke right watching explosions big screen! vaccinations. also got annual flu shot said autoimmune disease GP rhuematologist agreement take vaccine yet. enough review yet. willing take anyways. see received tolerated many others. stay home wear mask public. Riiiight. one Pfizer corporate thought implications CEO getting vaccine first. people morons know? stand corrected. Thanks links! Exactly. SIDE effects seen 6 weeks earlier. asked simple fucking question curious calm tits dude 92.1% (68.8%- 99.1%) efficacy 14 days first dose. 

Hopefully means impact mass vaccination seen lot quicker many people originally thought. Hopefully ones revamping system. think found room improvement countries. Kudos NZ. Might be. Sorry that. abstract title well suited either, LinkedIn- shares either. Well good them. theme parks. tested first vaccine used general public black women, doesn’t scream systemic racism don’t know wouldve 12 miles land middle trip. idk dont consider ""near coast"" consider 12 miles shore ever want jetski “what delayed effects” bullshit coming from?

What vaccine precedent caution? side effects aware vaccines permanently cause harm 10-15 years now? really think anyone would complain single person like guy gets vaccine first would give public lot confidence vaccine. Weird would allow exceptions mandatory protect people.... think you’re smarter everyone else, reality you’re low-achieving narcissist desperately clutching reasons feel superior others.

You’re dime dozen. rest? make difference first kid tested gave them. Neighbor got GBS tetanus shot. spent 5 1/2 months hospital, first two, 90% (or high %) paralyzed neck down. gets around now, still (6 years later) nerve damage gets blood transfusions month conspiracy theorist would definitely make want it. covid positive person, also dont need either I'll develop antibodies normal way sounds like it’s still approved way though data discussed Thursdays VRBPAC meeting decide recommend Moderna vaccine EUA FDA. 

Hopefully EUA comes weekend distribution beings early next week. continue 200k cases per day, may 45 year olds admitted turned away. people die infected June may die healthcare system cannot give adequate treatment. doesn’t matter there’s pandemic global, society disrupting disaster; always count bureaucracy pointlessly waste time accomplish nothing value post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

2020 one shining example it, yet another experiment undoubtedly lead cases. Abstract

Governments attempting control COVID-19 pandemic nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, effectiveness different NPIs reducing transmission poorly understood. gathered chronological data implementation NPIs several European, other, countries January end May 2020. estimate effectiveness NPIs, ranging limiting gathering sizes, business closures, closure educational institutions stay-at-home orders. so, used Bayesian hierarchical model links NPI implementation dates national case death counts supported results extensive empirical validation. Closing educational institutions, limiting gatherings 10 people less, closing face-to-face businesses reduced transmission considerably. additional effect stay-at-home orders comparatively small. Alternative question: person responsible security building houses president fully, completely insured deductible/coinsurance/out pocket? worries. seen people Olympic jump conclusions based comments. Dictatorships less transparent democracies. Don’t know that’s even debate. don’t get point you’re trying make? That’s irrelevant, I’m talking CEO Pfizer &amp; reasoning taking vaccine.

So, saying Fauci &amp; past Presidents able “cut line”, CEO Pfizer, company produced vaccine?

Sounds like oxymoron me...so, agree man cutting line, support past Presidents &amp; Fauci cutting line? I’m Europe. trust authorities all. 

Of course wouldn’t even british american. unknown, governments won’t handle correctly. happens case live euopean union morally corrupt bureaucratics, likely handled worst all.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Cool beans. Good thing won’t able get particular COVID vaccine it’s development halted. Feel free get literally approved vaccines didn’t cause false positives HIV tests. need one. work together. Lol envisioned leading drug discovery biotech. 
You: guys one positive readout treatment working, repeats, orthogonal validations. That’s good enough, treatment probably works, it’s common sense. let’s go fda drug trials.
Investors: proceeds virtually laugh zoom room.  Still, important keep saying it. I've wearing double masks, Surgical mask plus Cloth mask periodically taking herbal cocktail. anything allergic dust sniffle during/after cleaning. Btw can't say anything long term sideeffects(if Any) yet, wait least 5 years that.

It fair point know results year, example.

However, also barely understand long term effects covid time. Many patients age long term lung heart damage. possible effects permanent happen frequently missed side effect vaccine could happen.

In end something need decide now. Unless doctor nurse, considering age health, almost certainly half year would turn get shot anyway. really suggest keep open mind review evidence next six months so. next summer, tens thousands volunteers vaccinated year already thanks trials, millions vaccinated 6 months. plenty evidence whether safe then. Remember, possible long term side effect needs common 3 10000 chance dying, 1 1000 chance needing ventilation, currently uncertain chance suffering permanent damage disease. hope get too. here. thought worst thing year would hearing 20/20 vision jokes. Fucking oops Thereby skyrocketing death rate? People still gonna die whether test saw thing Moderna’s website it, week ago. ""Hide behind social justice"" part. good authority optimists sub news means nothing absolutely fucked Lol dude. probably never catch NY deaths even close Costco selling mail one. It’s $150. INJECT STRAGHT VEINS. LITERALLY. probably argued get it, rejected leg stand Ah you’re well versed this. It’s ok. 

The US spent $1.95b Pfizer’s 100m doses option 500m more. 

The US spent $1b AZ’s 400m doses option more. 

Do see AZ attractive option every country world now? need explain further? like US retroactively threatening nuke Nagasaki days. production nowhere near demand. Pfizer vaccine mentions evidence stops transmission. people still got virus less severe symptoms. guess depends vaccine get.  national cohort VA patients, 27% survivors COVID-19 hospitalization readmitted died 60 days discharge, rate lower matched survivors pneumonia heart failure. However, rates readmission death higher pneumonia heart failure first 10 days discharge following COVID-19 hospitalization, suggesting period heightened risk clinical deterioration. Study limitations include inability measure readmissions non-VA hospitals older, male-predominant study population, may higher risk severe manifestations COVID-19. Public health surveillance clinical trials focused exclusively inpatient mortality may substantially underestimate burdens COVID-19. Ah shit! Look working democracy, learning mistakes. spin create mistrust Swedes divide Nordic countries other?
Swedencovid: Hold beer! pride? blame Republicans state healthcare. Half us furious them. know people (especially age group) recover side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

''I get someone would assume likely vaccine long term effects virus.''

This I'm assuming - I'm saying likely. point potential risk new vaccine unknown possibly far greater negative health consequences actually getting virus. swine flu vaccine (H1N1) good example happen vaccines rushed service. hope family recovers quickly complications, hope former coworker mend. :(
Stay safe. oh thank god opinion slave.

""just continue working somewhere doesnt give fuck puts risk death scared look elsewhere possibly make less money time""  I’d rather see county officials charged. know better. None people get choose. numbers start falling, particularly death numbers, PEOPLE choose open up. got tested back May September, came back positive. still emails CVS well. I’m hoping one false negative heard that’s possible come back positive, it’s actually negative. far know, says times positive. still feel affects covid. don’t call “symptomatic infection”? german would still prefer Moderna. promise option choose Since people hesitant take new rushed vaccine called antivaxxers opposed people skeptical Big Pharma quickly rolled out, doubt getting honest answers. Kinda like Trump 3% chance winning nobody voting him. Polls tell much people afraid answer honestly. Belgium still worse both. would make infertile? girlfriend bartended 2 shifts week bar ignored guidelines pretended like Covid didn’t exist. ended hospital double pneumonia COVID. likely contracted virus day Christmas, local order bar never open. 

The bar owner still sending texts “rats” “people get sick proof didn’t get sick Walmart.” true Pfizer vaccine causing bells palsy? read report said 6 people UK died vaccine causing it. Agreed, fight going back, would, looks like company settled WFH since we've posted high productivity high sales. short, we've proved setup work want it, enough critical mass agreed we're attempting sell office building itself. Server equipment moved Christmas. 

It would hard switch company offer WFH now. compensation increase would substantial. save lot money time now. don’t understand thought process saying multiple successful vaccines won’t mean end pandemic. seem want continue forever. Covid never eradicated, need continue measures population vaccine. also hire people two-year engineering technology degrees (plus BMET certifications). Medical equipment expensive enough hospitals employ people repair maintain instead throwing something breaks. Oh, thank God opinion low-effort privilege.

""Just take money trust fund."" Exactly. contact tracing report information back local HHS Cities working in.

We ask last time worked showed symptoms, go back see shift spiderweb there.

We three occasions contact tracing revealed job transmission. It’s exact course people involved could infected separately, it’s honestly best still maintain privacy ensure compliance.

What’s since June protective barriers passengers public almost every one clients allows riders board rear doors. Ridership roughly 25-40% normal moment.

We one single reported case passenger reporting symptoms. 

Any time happens strict cleaning protocol including quarantining staff vehicles involved.

Sorry lot detail probably wanted. flu shot (SARS well) uses RNA? realize read PDF right? even conveniently labeled section called ""Efficacy Considerations"" Wow really got foot door one. that's major HIPAA violation likely get license suspended. would waste resources manufacturing distributing vaccine allows 4x cases?

Because supply-constrained. could vaccinate high-risk groups Pfizer/Moderna vaccinate young, low-risk patients Oxford vaccine parallel. Without Oxford vaccine low-risk group would get vaccine long time, certainly worse 62% effective vaccine.  Yeah live we're finally getting hit harder pandemic avoiding worst year Lmao posting history. 

Not sure brought race might something fantasy wanting become small curvy Korean girl weirdo. much better half glass, standard refrigeration vs -70C cold chain huge milestone ideal trials back up. 

we multiple options pfizer ship frontline immediately, moderna keep plugging away doses much safer stockpile. pledges hundreds millions already mean disrespect respect choice refrain. Sadly stage little trust faith people professed best interest mind. used protein likely gene encoding protein HIV, HIV many different proteins using one functional purpose carry risk. think capable causing HIV, like taking empty egg shell expecting chicken. 

The issue protein generated antibodies, unsurprising, antibodies level recognised HIV tests leading incorrectly positive test. woman thinking children soon little wary potential effects developing fetus. However, haven’t done lot research area I’m writing off, trying give example nurses might wary. Especially nursing female dominated profession. 
I know lot nurses also upset might forced facility get vaccine, regardless feel it. one like 10 people get covid twice? they're encouraging spread virus? Oh look, internet troll opens fat mouth again. vaccine's effectiveness BIPOC?  It’s thing good dates medicine: usually it’s actually good date, never tested absolutely sure. Cheaper test year two call good.

I read recently tested pain meds 70s, we’re like almost 50 years old, least 90% effective.

When comes medical science serious claims exactly tested trials. US FDA also one US regulatory agencies strict western counterparts. OMFG put HIV vaccine. Jesus christ. Read article. I'll copy key sentences you:

""after inoculation produced **false positive** test results H.I.V. volunteers participating trial study.""

""The trouble arose Australian vaccine, developed University Queensland biotech company CSL, related use **two fragments protein** found H.I.V.""

""The protein formed part molecular “clamp” researchers placed spikes surround coronavirus allow enter healthy cells. **The clamp stabilizes spikes, allowing immune system respond effectively vaccine.**

**The use H.I.V. protein posed risk infecting volunteers virus**, researchers said. clamp generated production antibodies recognized H.I.V. tests higher levels scientists expected.""

&amp;#x200B;

Basically used part HIV protein helps stronger immune response. protein parts get picked HIV tests (not surprisingly really) people test FALSE POSITIVE HIV. course particularly useful. noticed canned it. “Bailey said staunch supporter President Trump, it’s understandable wouldn’t want focus negative attention Trump regime, condition White House staff impact U.S. government functions world stage.” Yeah, I'm thinking might done earlier people think case rate high. Maybe even late December early January file EUA.  

Oxford testing combo approach Sputnik V ... Fuck sign deal Russia make Sputnik V done it. Seems Oxford may screwed pooch. honest would prefer moderna instead biontec. choice.. guess not. new strain? Sign respect. like that. Well done.  Unfortunately, yes. Same. Came gay January really looking forward big slut year make lost time. Anti-maskers start young. want start flying work  mean yes can. get vaccine. take ONE slot push line back ONE person.

But convince hundreds thousands irrational people willing stand product potentially sway getting vaccine well. Unfort heard fuckton florida residents love guy. young population obv, that’s thing, it’s oldest state Good, risk population. Let another hotbed area it. first one get Well guess know whose swatted next. Jessica Jones first surely last  One dose make difference.

“It’s one person coming China. control. It’s going fine,” Trump told CNBC’s Joe Kernen World Economic Forum Davos. see many anti vaccine people fuck us long time here. Whoops. Upvoted! Well, director critical care, zero contact patients. Relevant username impression small handful young people receiving lung transplants Covid?  Can't. There's teeth order. actually want companies shut down. entirety American government neoliberal neocon corporatists play acting representing constituents. keep signing volunteer trials hopefully get never got calls back paranoid, would even believe CEO Pfizer's word taken it??

That’s point though, wasn’t paranoid this. I’m studying science related field IMO use “science” describe things explainable data, I’ve found eclipse lot things he’s lying lol  lot still stacked refrigerated trucks, waiting taken care of. Right part success Pfizer, seen essential operation. want protect him? Mmmmmm much winningest  agree. appears people unhappy said. But, see politicians old rules thee me. absolutely going leave bad taste peoples mouths. refuse take tho, people higher risk Right, close Moderna's results, 30,000 volunteers, 185 infections placebo group, 11 vaccine group. 

As point number could change volunteers, true, unlikely. example, Russian vaccine candidate reported data three times, first release 20 cases, second release 39 cases, third release 78 cases. ratio infections vaccine placebo pretty much time, grew increasingly confident time cases recorded. best explanation bad decision part. (Unless knows something don’t) “Cut line” hahahaha CEO major drug company. He’s risky job. CEO floor mandates full mask protocol. 
There conspiracy. White House staff already vaccinated. Bodies kept refrigerated trailers months, too. strange. correct legal enforcement, problem. legal ramifications putting communities risk, actually want that. want able act like they're something without actually anything. ordered hundreds millions companies  know panel didn’t vote unanimously? look reasoning all? Willing bet didn’t.  Yeah definitely makes sense. main goal flatten curve that’s basically would do. 

So Fauci probably whole promise deliver thing. Lockdowns work free movement people, think agree that.

My question nations introduce quarantine? set ever supposed work?  'Science"" good catch phrase really. 

Because trusting Science tells us encapsulates wide variety behaviours attitudes far extend beyond anti-vaccine stuff. post vaccines ""deployed speak"" make seem nursing homes locked short period big deal wait little longer. us. means vaccines Haha, yeah thats it. Well sucks. fair others arseholes hurt right thing.  makes sense me. national triage situation need allocate resources based need. One 5000 50 according CDC. number far less 18. yea, point stands. mine. side affect occurs say 1/100k wouldn’t know yet. Crazy one else even tried quarantining arrivals, somehow Thailand/Vietnam/China us figure out...

Heck, *Singapore*. literal transit hub - seen numbers lately? scientists clinicians? Exactly, optics. optics remember lowest common denominator. science said DDT healthy? science gave kids mercury tablets? 

Which science. I’m trying keep Sure... would neither things, qualified position placed position family friend? Honestly, CEO first use product show trust concerns me. actually reason gotten vaccine yet Black Americans trust US government interact us good faith vaccine prove problematic? consoles. Almost recently released PC parts impossible get. Especially GPUs CPUs AMD Nvidia. half-assed shit science problem. give fucking nutjobs toe-hold. Everyone's arms saving life COVID (really small number), yet one bat's eye countries unable secure vaccine.

Worlds filled hypocrisy guess right, given (at least American) societies refusal make even simple aesthetic sacrifices collective good. One day new variant pop that's either deadly contagious (viruses tend gain attributes time, never know). controlling spread crucial, vaccines develop still effective time deploy them... mean, know little new variant, letting virus infect 100 million people whatever we're globally playing fire. think nurses sudden change mind one rich asshole gets it? created another company Germany. distributor. Think Beer. Im sure mean, populace following governments advice (like Australia) detrimental government advice bad.

Sweden's population setup fail, sure turn around moment :( Genuinely understand ""on camera"" part. 

Are conspiracy nuts believe vaccines fake government microchips whatever nonsense, believe government smart enough give elites fake version camera?

Just seems silly...but guess hurt. BS. Yes decision. met CEO big company before? bit crazy (in specific way) know right 90%+ time. wasn’t talking myself. looked link, Florida official dashboard showing tens deaths last days appears drastically undercounting deaths compared dashboards reports. THANK YOU. Tired americans trying take credit like everything else there. Wow redneck troll account. Yeah it’s contrarian understand kids aren’t mini adults. r/woooosh havr almost 2 year old fine wearing mask. He’ll take sometimes remind put back it. parents ask keep him. It’s difficult. Keep reminding kid example, always wearing mask we’re outside aren’t ones folks, saw post morning showing % citizens pretty much every nation much trust new vaccine. France higher % population antivax/on fence new vaccines USA does. That's lot mental gymnastics thinking doesnt want take definition ""essential worker"", used designate front line employees highest chance getting exposed yet still need work everyday site, essential worker. 

You make claim essential part pandemic relief, factually belong ""essential worker"" category aren’t flying acute crisis passes. worry they’ll mandate forever don’t think correct. mandates covid past, any, shouldn’t young children. Quick question: exact birthday? still can... want get high risk people first Ya sarcastic. it’s honestly happiest productive period life. Living simply nice. Look open nose throat. agree. rural, mask utilization drops precipitously.  Get test 8th day 1. ""brand new kind vaccine"" - fucking process we've used decades. realize Flu vaccine made every year new strains flu involved, right?

2. See #1 Yeah, depends company location you’re at. part SF you’re coming from. Certain neighborhoods don’t close shuttles, getting commute own.

They opening SF offices (for companies) prior too, I’d noticed lot people lived city able stop commuting South Bay. Oakland offices well.

It’s definitely fun commute, buses cushy. Best way commute Bay far. I’d take commuting hour half even 30 minutes driving myself.

I definitely know lot younger techies unhappy right though. went relatively fun job (in scheme things) got free food snacks, events parties planned almost weekly basis, campus fully functioning gyms entertainment centers... stuck apartment nothing do.

I’m sure there’s plenty people live city enjoy working home too, think really comes wealthiest established. Even 6 figure job isn’t enough get decently roomy apartment nice set ups. people know happy remote work tend older wealthier right least, that’s anecdotal.

Don’t get wrong, option remote work great. It’s great people live farther prefer work home work jobs can. It’ll help housing crisis raising family much easier people.

I’m concerned going end massive downgrade younger workforce, simultaneously making easier lower wages disproportionate level since won’t appeal cost living standards Bay. create it.

Can’t win either way people say scared take it. really irrational, though? completely novel mechanism, much prior research abandoned due grave side-effects (like possible development auto-immune diseases), gone full phase III clinical trials (which take another 2 years).

If traditional protein vaccine, that'd one thing. But, personally I'm going wait full FDA approval (rather EUA) take it.

Free masks every day every warehouse. Literally giving away millions. handled well. Crazy covid killed many people death totals right average years past....... Eventually cases go wont enough people infect infected already exchange many extra years life ? Yeah, seems worth me. even trying say here? whats problem exactly?

I won’t ever able use FaceTime over. I’ve hear many families say goodbye afar. I’ve hide tears prepare wives husbands lose spouses they’ve married 40,50 years. I’ve heard people’s school-aged children begging live, screaming grief realization never see parent again. end isn’t death scars you. It’s consequences echo society long time. makes trust even less honestly.. Like want believe he's kindness something feels don’t know long quantities going limited. delay approvals, manufacturing distribution could mean giving Americans priority average citizen much next year. There’s already clinical trials wtf Skepticism healthy, it’s rational. Accepting everything face value asinine. majority people skeptical hastily created vaccine. 

To completely ease vaccine adhere following:

We race come level scientific sophistication Pfizer BioNTech scientists (a profit company shareholders) created near perfect vaccine deadliest disease since Spanish Flu less 1 year. assume trials 40k vaccine testers undergoing result severe side effects. Next, assume Pfizer executives spared expense creating disseminating said vaccine, (something goes principles modern capitalism business practices). See: Boeing 737 example, want keep industry specific: Methadone. Continuing, assume every involved scientist/virologist agreed whole-heartedly vaccine 100% ready, shred doubt exist single scientists’ mind vaccine full proof. would ensure business executives (CEO) press complete vaccine hastily, leads errors (human nature imperfection). 

Perspective key right? Pfizer winning big-pharma lotto first mover advantage. another half dozen vaccines years, better last. Pfizer’s top line going explode. Statistics what? Truthfully co-workers expecting covid baby boom covid relationship reset(which ive seen among younger co-workers bit). else f- walk around? Plus think new onlyfan channels. Look another lockdown skeptic appears ! like CEOs stand behind mean friends likely crazy 1st 3rd current wife that’s anti-vax nut job.

I feel like breed people much time hand sit around falling FB rabbit hole mean take molotov cocktail Us bad = Europe good Thank giving shit. Truly. sarcasm. Sincerely. 

What I’ve sadly learned people don’t care much themselves, certainly don’t care surrounding them. Whether it’s friend, stranger, family member. spent? It’s deeply alarming can’t help wonder, state affairs around entire world come expect without question? 
Why become apathetic? 

But much also acknowledge tirelessly sacrificed greater good, people front lines done everything take care everyone else, many cases lost lives. many go unnoticed disdain seems much louder. fucked human beings? Witnessing best worst humanity surely mind fuck didn’t ask 2020. 

Sorry, veered philosophical. Maybe much time hands think. 
🤣😂😆 Nope. worked long term either. sure people think this. Show somewhere ""2 week"" national lockdown actually stopped virus.

Whats ""hard lockdown"" anyway? still lots people need work maintain essential services. want food, electricity, water, waste disposal, internet, medical care, medicine etc right? lockdown like talking nothing pipe dream today's world. covering. covering ever cover infant's face. considered ""blanket"". Safe Sleep strict reason. blankets, toys, stuffed animals, loose articles clothing, hats sleep, crib bumpers- prevent anything covering baby's face. Even swaddle blanket, actually piece muslin fabric thinner 2 ply cotton mask, discouraged sleep sacks velcro encouraged- fear infant fight muslin swaddle, flail arms thin piece muslin cover face. includes naps, babies take anywhere. crib must completely flat. mattress must soft. Baby must placed back always sleep. obviously kids, parent knows put anything- ANYTHING- infant's nose mouth. I’m going go ASAP. Tbh. Feels like they've learned thing two (anti-maskers would say opposite, though, sure). Sorry, 100, edit. BS. probably trust vaccine. worry...I know someone works sales Pfizer spreading meme-like thing taking Pfizer vaccine everything normal...and turns Cyrillic writing (as though ""turning"" Russian).

Dude makes 150k year spreads crap even make sense. I've wondered ""exposing"" would get fired, really care. God damn dumb little shady!! one family members dies thing dedicating whole life making vaccines prevent happening Yeah yeah, sure... Cut line haha I’ll take glimmer hope get. 

I won’t say anyone pushed back line, wanna take give ‘em without hesitation regardless past. get sentiment vindictiveness never leads progress. 

The vax best chance beating this. Let’s fight shouldn’t get focus should, nearly everyone. 

As spotty surveys polls be, might offer glimmer hope:

[A recent Ipsos poll 8 10 Americans saying get quarter Republicans say never. Stay safe buddy. Winter increase it. little old.

Currently White house negotiating plan get vaccines 2nd quarter.

""So working collaboratively make sure find ways produce allocate doses second quarter well. signed agreement yet,"" Bourla said.

We see comes What's people view realism logical thinking baseless ""fear""? bear coming you, need know dangerous animal make attempt escape life. 

This global pandemic. That's hyperbole, that's fact. Pandemics deadly. pathetic weak discuss potential harm, actual harm, done protect people. Ready February see family. Im sure thats gotten yet technically right. beta version 2020. alpha version 2020 come soon. Could reaching partial herd immunity certain areas? Doesn’t seem like Thanksgiving surge ever happened.

Everyone doesn’t COVID get boo fucking hoo. get people think wary crazy even [FDA advisory vote unanimously it. 17-4 vote one abstain. Jesus. Hey sell short, getting vaccine hoe helps people too! ways one! Username checks out. n=30,000 wasn’t enough you?  said took vaccine got covid still..... could imagine millions they'd spend fix PR nightmare. realize child 2 years old forever, right? fly they're mature enough wear damn mask, pandemic gets control reasonable extent.  least one It’s candle sort thing, isn’t it? There’s way would work. best thing would open windows while. Wear masks it’s well ventilated. could inject saline solution, find stated stance honest somehow Fauci gave interview said expects March/April US people high risk groups able get Fall everything back normal. It’s random person. 

You either knowingly make false argument you’re one people can’t tell difference doctor’s opinion, random person’s opinion, opinion CEOs company made vaccine.

In either case - discussion probably won’t make lot sense. exhaustion real! Sorry you’ve exposed: hope dont end sick :( He's damned takes damned doesn't. case feel he's taking high road saying wait turn. like someone donating $100 homeless person putting YouTube make $10k ad revenue. want cut he's good person, cut good person.

Why? think take vaccine. change fact conspiracy. using word incorrectly. University Queensland vaccine used HIV protein development.

Uhh, no, US. literally Google ""Spanish flu masks"" find wrong. Here's [one there's bunch examples. 1k deaths day success.

 many per day? I’m sorry :( seems little early make call. Yeah right 30,000 patients received vaccine clinical trials. Nobody receiving vaccine “guinea pig” don’t plan taking dog musical instrument care about. make sure get seat second tell overbook flight might “reaccomodate” like Dr Dao.

United ways go choose anyone else. feel free use criteria, course. :) covid damage balls? hell even get airport without masks? I, ever occured would need take point cohort vaccination. anything, taking upfront would make lose confidence another me-first elite.

I know coworkers excited rolling know regulatory agencies first-hand. work time. They're going rubber-stamp thing. created it, still wants country distribute fairly rather using position get shot immediately

He \*not\* create it, even company, BioNTech did, Pfizer ""just"" mass production distribution. well, biontech ceo announced he'll get soon approved. that's something, guess. There's good treatment flu Tamiflu useless. Hence Time article posted overflowing hospitals 2018. Yeah. gets vaccine early ""BILLIONAIRE CUTTING LINE!"". doesn't, ""THIS PROVES HE'S PART GLOBALIST CABAL!!"" Well numbers scare avoid mississippi alabama, highest levels people rejected evolution completely protestants, highly located States.

Exactly. Honestly, that's need go further.

Maybe beginning ""we'll give $1500 stimulus check, agree get vaccine.""

If work, go ""it mandatory get vaccine. throw jail agree get vaccine- think free dedicated muh FREEDOM! get vaccine. second jail, intend strap table forcibly inject vaccine.""

Sadly, might even go past go far ""In 2021, kicking COVID's ass, end, metal going puncture every person America. Choose want metal be: needle arm bullet skull."" sounds like someone conflict interest fair, every scientist worth salt agrees long term side effects still completely unknown. doesn’t anything „doubting“ believing vaccines effectiveness. He's business exec big pharma. need that. job force America take it, job make company shit loads money. He's done job, personally taking vaccine really impact that. help notice every time Sinopharm vaccine mentioned article, China mentioned headline. 


Does count breaking ""no politics"" rule? article’s attention nothing sucking corporation. it’s worth could’ve pretended take vaccine still “cut line”. Ditto. read data that's given healthcare workers administering vaccine also raised eybrows regarding breast feeding reproduction. miss things.  El-arairah vibes ""People keep using conspiracy label everything. correct. "" 
Agreed. seems like disingenuous tactic silence anyone 'wrong' speculations. example, merely speculate excess deaths may partly attributed people making less healthy choices would without pandemic. CONSPIRACY THEORY!!! Even speculating covid may led worsening outcomes various diseases. yeah, can' really know CEO Pfizer really thinking beyond scope possibility wants wait see months getting jab. entirely possible either wants appear benevolent genuinely benevolent. Whether gets vaccine early, people either claim he's cutting line reluctance seems fishy. Hmm...did say whether sterilising immunity immunity symptomatic disease?

Perhaps Santa asymptomatic superspreader. ""Debate"" would imply moron point, absolutely zero. 1/3 Americans understanding science. discount 💯. Well, uh, stop sending money then? 🤷‍♀️ Seems like hatred motherland comes subjective deeply personal place. 

Honestly, shit like OFWs really frustrates me. expect community helps raise people like happy enough unfairly paint country backward dangerous soon get motherland. Funnily enough, point Swedish person replied exactly people paint Sweden unfairly like PH.

## Abstract

### Background

Treatment patients COVID-19 included supportive care mainly relief symptoms disease. Although World Health Organization (WHO) recommended effective treatments COVID-19, reports use antiviral drugs. aim study determine effect Arbidol (ARB) COVID-19 disease.

### Methods

Using open-label randomized controlled trial, examined efficacy ARB patients COVID-19 teaching hospital. One hundred eligible patients diagnosis COVID-19 recruited study assigned randomly two groups either hydroxychloroquine followed KALETRA (Lopinavir/ritonavir) hydroxychloroquine followed ARB. primary outcome hospitalization duration clinical improvement 7 days admission. criteria improvement relief cough, dyspnea, fever. Time relief fever also assessed across two groups. Without dropouts, 100 patients entered study final analysis significance level 0.05.

### Results

The mean age patients 56.6 (17.8) years 56.2 (14.8) years ARB KALETRA groups, respectively. Majority patients male across two groups (66 54%). duration hospitalization ARB group significantly less KALETRA arm (7.2 versus 9.6 days; *P* = 0.02). Time relief fever almost similar across two groups (2.7 versus 3.1 days ARB KALETRA arms, respectively). Peripheral oxygen saturation rate significantly different 7 days admission across two groups (94% versus 92% ARB KALETRA groups respectively) (*P* = 0.02). Based multiple linear regression analysis, IHD, Na level, oxygen saturation time admission type therapy independent adjusted variables determined duration hospitalization patients COVID-19.

### Conclusion

Our findings showed Arbidol, compared KALETRA, significantly contributes clinical laboratory improvements, including peripheral oxygen saturation, requiring ICU admissions, duration hospitalization, chest CT involvements, WBC, ESR. suggest studies ARB COVID-19 using larger sample size multicenter design. Last Easter mean. It’s like CEO going factory steal dose. Even gets Covid best medical treatment need rush idea anti vaccination people going turned CEO taking vaccine ridiculous. People already prone believing nonsense would come reason it’s fake can’t trust it. 

If think vaccines cause autism, you’re going take vaccine. It’s simple. knowingly wasted time?

To much reading

I know. I'm laughing right now. definitely mad. lot cursing calling names someone who's mad bet has...

PR moment need test 30000 people unicorn blood man. safe Oh no. sounds like governments problem.

They're production company, job babysit covid skeptics would actually take vaccine ensure doesn’t get virus, like we’re supposed to, given vital role vaccination roll out? 🤷‍♂️ probably lie. stupid take Dude literally runs company like chauffeur runs carriage. impressive, horse work. want nitpick H2O chiral. need 0 planes symmetry chirality H2O least 2. that's point. ""Protect others themselves"" works keep mind ""the vaccine apparently may allow get it, keep asymptomatic serious- table get vaccine, get COVID, spread COVID people get vaccine yet. Part protecting others them, such, giving people things right vaccine first. Sending condolences family. RIP Prime Minister Ambrose. much. Skipped.

I expected nothing less Damn bro. goes whole blm movement then. got baited prettt hard

Funny one arguing lives matter one arguing subset matters more. apply silly logic seems like I'm one arguing BLM one arguing it- since racism ignorance go together surprised argue BLM funny mad

I'd actually mad determine that- honestly- I'm actually laughing ass off. either troll idiot (probably both) love laughing village idiot? :) selfish pricks start riot feel freedom risk. guy prequels (memes?) Looking forward it. Yea fuck science incapable independent thought. BRO DATS MAD SKETCHY Wow. CEO pharma company uses corp speak.

Also, really pharma company politics it?

It's job manufacture vaccine. problem trust Please get vasectomy join #Vhemt spawn scumbag parasites like doctor women doctor children think we're forgetting something here, get happy vaccine. virus already mutated 7 8 times. know vaccine last long one, two protect mutated strains? know answer either question. They're saying everyone nursing home vaccinated Christmas.

Had FDA moved faster, 2 additional weeks likely would meant 50% plus immunity people.

Would made hospital situation *much, much* better. ""But WANAAAA"" — guy, probably Purp Sus Feel free explain selling vaccine think safe take knowingly trading human life suffering profit.

Not happening, course, idea obviously qualifies. Come on. I'd shit less sending money (made thanks Sweden letting stay employed despite pandemic) friends gotten paid months. Uh yes lol Hopefully allowed hopefully someone help me. I’m Wisconsin googling relentlessly hours since vaccine supposedly hit state. live with, taking care 90 year old grandma. She’s family left hers. Everything I’m reading says elderly long term care centers/assisted living centers first receive vaccine. can’t find literature situation like ours. could care less vaccine myself, people job coming positive I’m scared death. anyone reliable info sign do? Medicare already seems like state completely forgot seniors living own. info would greatly appreciated Why? patients we're critical sent medic facilities prepared isolate care patients infectious disease? Nursing homes qualified medical staff, properly done jobs. ”no one saying word it”, hear/see argument constantly stupid people know order entailed even correct numbers. [Take look actual numbers, want prove stupid rest want do? Doxx myself? either take word well respected professionals prestigious positions including boards organizations, among things.... simply disregard comment hearsay conjecture. choice yours, reddit.... platform anonymity often takes precedence credibility. best you, understand skepticism, nothing personal. kind people need. idiot politicians nothing go get vaccine first. ffs  Really? Evidence? talking Pfizer's CEO? think swatting Jessica Jones would end well swatters. claims wrong. virus given yet.   near Spanish flu per capita. people actually stop idiotic stats? I’m incredibly sorry. Everyone’s death matter age hurts it’s even horrible see someone isn’t close end life die. say lost brother young cancer understand hurt brings. hope good support system. thing saved me. -South Dakota Even do, scale. Population much much larger 1918, percentage, significant comparison. Still bad. Hopefully vaccines make impact pretty quick. heard still tested often, all. one going forced take (or vaccine)

The question restrictions placed refuse it. They’d give placebo aren’t purpose dude.

That’s don’t seem get. doctors controlling virus locking things down. hospitals overloaded, people die. covid patients- happens. Cancer patients don’t get surgery, people don’t get tested screened cancers sorts illnesses they’d otherwise catch.

It’s isn’t happening, don’t seem get overloaded hospital system can’t keep up. It’s covid risk- it’s fact may staffing resources surgery itself.

The doctor may even available- nurses aren’t. depending surgery, think child goes recover? It’s often ICU intensive recovery rooms occupied covid patients.

I’m saying situation okay all, you’re acting like everything fine dandy doctors purpose. They’re not. You’re also ignoring fact covid child cancer that’s simultaneously recovering surgery incredibly dangerous. starters find hard believe Pfizer Moderna would stake brand image market share therapeutics pushing shitty products. there's that. Additionally covid comes common family viruses familiar I'm mistaken, firms *some* sort foundation work on. rest 100+ hour weeks R&amp;D manufacture full year everyone else bitching wear mask. don’t think that’s saying. I’m saying surrounded rational scientist intelligent business leaders, he’s making daily decisions conspiracy theories Important note based symptoms certain amount time. everyone tested could still asymptotic presymptomatic cases tracked. effectiveness measure reducing symptoms. Similar flu vaccine prevent transmission, keep hospitals getting overwhelmed.  Cuomo NY: 35,200 dead

This total deaths state. slightly 7,000 deaths nursing homes.

For total deaths, New York, Texas, California, Florida equal 100k. unsurprisingly, top four populous states country.

If assume four amount nursing home deaths, that's 28k, slightly less 10% deaths.  Might long time. Ok ultimately decision. It’s body, all. true justification tho? want steady job lose home, kids depressed crying every day, hope future. Since one bedroom apartment, gonna kinda tough, plan disinfecting everything touch limiting trips store federal building would require Covid vaccine go in? reasonably confident get spare one bro. even vaccines Yeah it’s hard sniff Marxism honestly thought thing. ashtray worried people refusing. time cut line ""hey, look me! here, see, safe!"" 1. islands much smaller populations, laws ability lock one country vs states 2. Like said ship sailed. math work point. I’m saying wouldn’t worked, would exercise futility now. 

EU much better comparison us imo. Yeah, EU though. imagine Germany wait EU whole approve pfizer make use can't approve own. seems EU rush tk get approved hence delay Ok, cut price it? Thanks! know, commented sub-thread wanted travel hopefully enough money, really want travel NYC, since sisters mom went went last October pre-COVID. Yet lot people always assume scam folks brains broken think Russia Mordor Russians orcs. 

The USSR actually huge robust vaccination infrastructure, arguably eradicate polio US did, US would give Salk vaccine countries aligned them, whereas Soviets proliferated improved Sabin vaccine worldwide.

But minds Americans, Russians incapable dressing morning. Couldnt get vaccine? feel irresponsible get don’t need others bad “Tank company”

Lolololol must new pharmaceutical industry. Even vaccine killing thousands people, legal liability doesn’t even matter stock price goes since already made billions.

You really need look type shit Pfizer already pulled past. They’re probably kings fraud. MS* - MI Michigan Thank dipshit worth math. Per capita case/death stat matters. People still think usa death count worst around 15th New headline: Pfizer boss sacrifices grandmother vaccine testing

Well that’s you’ll see Twitter Insurance policies cross state lines, flights cross state lines, entry federal buildings, etc. Yeah. goes beyond medical abuse. US government considerable part American culture fuck us demonstrated repeatedly centuries. really. Right now, antivaxxers what's limiting amount people vaccinated. much people want vaccinate don't. constraint right supply vaccine

In months, might get somewhere close vaccinating people need most. point, go general public. priority PR stunts like that. Otherwise giving rich famous people chance cut line He's also one important people vaccination project. Makes sense. Covid killed half world population significantly higher. stop using numbers similar idiots? Right? Dakotas far worse position attest 

My daughters school 1... 1.. confirmed case last week Haha Same! Never travel via plane, really wanna see places. read end, say elderly at-risk people vaccinated first. makes sense cases may decrease young people vaccinated stop infecting others.

The number people react without reading article amazing me. can't imagine desperate outraged. cause he's smart shows dumb people today. Plot twist. took lied said didn’t? call bullsh**  You’re asking prove super spreaders, data support. assertion spreaders, data support. Schools closing kids testing positive outside activities, kids spreading classmates teachers. NYC schools positivity rate 1/10th general population. Valid question. 

There experiments done Black people without knowledge.

The [1932 Tuskegee Syphilis particularly cruel. participants primarily sharecroppers, many never visited doctor. Doctors U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), running study, informed participants—399 men latent syphilis control group 201 others free disease—they treated bad blood, term commonly used area time refer variety order track disease’s full progression, researchers provided effective care men died, went blind insane experienced severe health problems due untreated syphilis.

In another case [Henrietta cervical cancer medical community used cells (taken biopsy) medical research. done without consent family didn’t find 1975. 

Even though two examples, show medical field treated Black people time.  Damn, kind live music play may ask? have, skip meetings (skip layer management). know Reddit certain views, I'm going guess guy knows shit ton suspect does. read it.

&amp;#x200B;

July 22: HHS $1.95 billion funds Pfizer large-scale manufacturing nationwide distribution 100 million doses vaccine candidate. federal government 100 million doses vaccine initially produced result agreement, Pfizer deliver doses United States product successfully receives FDA EUA licensure, as outlined in FDA **guidance**, after completing demonstration safety efficacy large Phase 3 clinical trial, began July 27th.

&amp;#x200B;

There NOTHING saying helping development. stating fund manufacturing distribution vaccine gets FDA approvement. Also fund doses get. fact guarantee buy Pfitzer would get job done.

As stated. ""You invent gold donkey, buy gold"" risk taken help given development approval.

If invent bone-cancer cure ready help distributing nationwide. costs get work done drive Forrest would yell back take!  He's lying lol. didn’t get position nothing.

True, I'm sure fucked many people along way. College student, soon-to-be-graduated week, kind miss going library, homework, spending time playing card games roommates. Maybe could take visit alma mater future. That’s cool. 

As long it’s federal level. Data short-term side effects already collected clinical trials past couple months.

The real issue long-term side effects. Covid-19 vaccine basically skipped years trials testings. somehing unprecedented. can't seriously believe Covid-19 went rigorous process required vaccines. higher deaths per capita. It’s insane American centric people sub  California also three times people Illinois.

states huge populations seeing fall/winter explosions now, even situation upper midwest gets better, numbers keep skyrocketing. get situation control, numbers whole country start stabilize. guys working part maybe stay room guys don’t go into. Idk live access testing sites would test regularly well. extra careful exposure gets visit. Try quarantine much aside going work. Holy crap. Triplets... congrats! hope help. two, exactly one year apart, that's challenge. They're older still, good luck. blessing, also challenging. Sadly disagreeing/asking questions Reddit especially part it: I’m actually trying learn please don’t downvote troll.

You’re saying it’s “thoroughly tested” completed year, yet sort new vaccine done year, longest time (I would vote Trump media’s distaste him) narrative even bi-partisan experts impossible properly year. know it’s thoroughly tested? Oh I’m sure that’s reason.... seriously doubt able vaccinate even half population years time. Hell US shooting 50 million first 100 days Biden. Drop bucket. seems even though FDA, UK, Canada Bahrain approved still enough people trust it. fact Dr Fauci arguably famous doctor pandemic said he'll take it. People looking reasons trust it. even said took see people saying would say he's CEO hes tryna sell product. believe him. refuses get bad side effects hiding? Inside home, people would already around? Like suggested people do? Yeah real he’s gotten though impression vaccines mandatory elsewhere? agree. sad going disproportionately impact community that's already disproportionately impacted Covid. maybe knows something remember, treat elderly America. You’re going old one day too, aren’t already. Don’t surprised you’re left die like people left die. 🤷‍♂️ FDA long history fucking up, it’s like isn’t massive financial incentive rush one out. shit show *not* taking vaccine c'mon? optics taking look pretty bad going help fuel distrust vaccine. latest estimates US around 30-35% seroprevalence. higher areas like Dakotas lower areas like New York. since population (or herd) immunity work like kill switch instead works like faucet waterfall, definitely question. that's kind worries me. virus hurts way people like lung-scarring things, kills people. *if* vaccine prevent non-lethal damage, would totally quit fight let basically run us. 
 
hopefully we'll get data soon find works. Honestly probably get cross section public figures including politicians, CEOs, entertainers take publicly.

Vaccine skepticism something crosses standard political divide broad cross section people demonstrating willingness take save far lives dozen/hundreds doses would use up. Right? ever comes took lied everyone say ‘well duh did’ one bats eye. “In facilities, children taken care fixed groups rooms, ventilated five times day.“

So you’re telling me... appropriate precautions taken, kids don’t spread infections? don’t adults too? Maybe protocols place wouldn’t now?!

How many schools daycares know implementing strict measures curtail spread? exercise reader: replace “Frederick Great Prussia” “Pfizer’s CEO” “planting potatoes” “getting vaccine”. I'm sure there's overlap, feel like two different groups people.

Either way, point stands. incredibly difficult position in, every choice wrong one. I'm certainly glad I'm one making decisions. make cult personality thing though? cares x person takes it? It’s vaccine undergone rigorous trials. gets approved gets approved. celebrities took changing opinion stupid claims negative results counted matter many times someone tested negative, tested positive, matter many times, counted once. makes happy. works people take tho. I’m frustrated anti-vaxx comments see FB hear person. show people articles statements people deal overflowing hospital beds. People need regular care get delayed cause covid people needing care. Yet won’t take time comes cause think feel fine catch it. stops spreading isn’t worth it? opposite... criminal get 4 $4 doses millions 1 dose rounding error anything, foolish even pretend matters. People weak enough die covid due age conditions obviously protective health average likely make large chunk skeptics means unnecessary deaths arent willing take soon available. allowed give shit lives, cruel right, say hundreds thousands/millions worth less 1 singular dose given man stands benefit even vaccine harmful short sighted laughable. number folks hear think vaccine damned high.

Doesn't help everyone wants huff hopium holidays.

Gonna lot folks seeing vaccines positive news around Covid weeks leading Christmas gather worried anymore. I'll probably always wear mask point, not? air quality ever good year. really really hope get vaccinated soon possible treatments work. I'm sorry happening you. wear mask destinations hope friends acquaintances too. still is. Plenty time manner assorted fuckery. Yes, message children comfort reduce anxiety Santa bringing presents.

It meant adults completely ignore reality expose children virus.  SIR WENDY'S even get stimulus check :( Pretty handicapped point making. People generally wait for... people? get vaccinated? everyone wait everyone else take see there’s negative effects? I’m sure see doesn’t make sense. mention making sense, reasonably dictate group people vaccinated first expected potentially damaging outcomes? say “x group people take risk rest us wait out”? typical mindset US, pretty pathetic. You’re much important everyone isn’t know cases driven small family gatherings exactly like yours.

Things worst they’ve ever been. We’re losing 3000 people per day hospital capacity scary high right now. good idea.

With vaccine total freedom mere months away, risk now?? wonder laugh emojis meant laughing *with* idiots *at* idiots? would post laugh emoji laughing *at* them, still absolutely pissed can't get back normal morons can't skip Christmas traditions one god damn year. don’t know, besides crazy ones haven’t seen tbh don’t check everyone Pfizer stated cannot provide additional doses June, Moderna stated ""second quarter"" could early April. Since Moderna producing US US priority additional doses, hope sooner June.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Giving away vaccine free would ridiculous expectation. companies would shooting head that. would cool sold cost (no profit) instead, unfortunately capitalist forces dictate entire executive team would lose jobs that, won’t happen either.

I would actually go saying government offer vaccine free. think actually pay people get it, least US seems incentives people respond blindingly obvious self-interest. That's gonna depend many people refuse get vaccine. got argument wife morning said kids get five years (which crazy). told they're getting I. Thanks I'm extremely optimistic things... fucking &amp; buying home far away work without clarifying WFH policy, wishful thinking, plain thinking. Like, level that's required brain keep body ticking sort thinking. Yeah, comment like makes hospital look bad alright. 4 x 109 = 436 million link census says 328 million. taking flu vaccine every year? gonna bed? people leave alone Bloomberg treating counties like U.S. comes taking word Tell Jesuits. That's different corporate health system.

Good using ability speak out. Even it’s available public April, still need time distribute whole “two shot” thing that’s extra timeline tack on. I’m optimistic we’ll much different place time next year boy people acting like done March April together Dude full week wet towels doors taped together trash bags cover windows. legit kept wet towel breathe (not sure helped placebo oxygen strong)


I even close fires never evacuation warning, smoke bad what? carry vaccine? say that. 
Your argument valid, point crap leaders said things effect children affected certainly are--they're carrying disease right back families school. China testing kids young 3 vaccine. definitely way behind rest developed world far Covid goes--we're longer authorities leaders anything fail Pandemic. vaccine available mandated school children, pandemic brought would like see parents charged criminal neglect taking children event ok local/state laws, put county? guess - August LEAST.  Community spread indeed. can’t miss taking kids see Santa one year, going avoid meaningful interactions family members close people spread potentially make someone seriously ill worse? “more often not” claim BS. think majority healthcare workers don’t want vaccine? committee healthcare professionals voted 17-4 favor it, dissenting votes largely due wording 16 17 year olds included.

There’s mystical force, deep state pushing mRNA vaccines specifically. first ones done. JNJ one AstroZeneca one mRNA it’s like weren’t developed. far we’ve seen better results mRNA ones reason doubt safety. Arizona Yuma fired ICU Doctor speaking conditions currently facing. worked NYC 1st wave extensive knowledge Covid protocols. Corporate America give af family definitely employees. Stay home, wear mask, socially distance wait turn vaccine. Pushing people newsletter exactly InfoWars got deplatformed. site seems like glorified InfoWars dash (questionable) science. know anyone else feel wary people asking donations, especially someone else's behalf, there's transparency actual expenses are. understand point  320k house TX would cost 900k CA, that's point, total pocket tax still high. Bull. vaccine approved US. Today 330.000.000 people US. don’t care health well-being, I’m afraid I’m afraid I’m mature enough understand things wait. vaccine.

Fuck guy fuck corporate PR machine trying spin good guy. think people concerned safety vaccine pushed fast without understanding long-term effects Moderna is, then. Admittedly, I've stayed away prescription drugs life, seen headlines regarding pharma companies. friends turned addicts doctors, though. Thanks info. Wow truly overwhelmed. Warzones huh. I’m amazed time rehearse plan dances. like stupid tik tok dances

Dancing nurses one first ways people started question pandemic. Right, like 3 weeks first shot second shot. 3 week window determine effectiveness one shot. Unless gave set subjects one shot second booster shot way really get valid effectiveness.

The Pfizer trial document even indicated such. said limited time data like 52% effectiveness affirm amount confidence three weeks data per subject.

There's doubt there's level effectiveness, can't say level confidence actually is. .....and, question turn lockdowns. lockdown PEOPLE IDIOTS think it’s ok get Santa picture pandemic. mental gymnastics public officials go justify complete irresponsibility incompetence astounding.

""Yeah, made decision kill kids but, hey, normal!"" long think circulating US first confirmed case? sickest I've ever last January still wondering could covid (I live West Coast homeless then) Yeah, friend's family got waves far know everyone recovering, however LA we've got like 300 ICU beds think whole county 1 100 people need intensive care tested positive yesterday we're already another hundred beds future. people educated feel risk worth benefit. Sure ...test 20k ppl catch genetic, ethnic, metabolic variables, months 👍

Amazing 😁 released public enough available public yet...not frontline workers tested now. recently disagree you. seen plenty people without mask got planes according blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Two people know died it, Cali, sister got couple weeks ago finally negative. cousin MD north France got says 4-6 patients day dying day covid ward. whole family except meeting LA Xmas, sister pissed I'm going numbers indicate BAD IDEA. feel like asshole one Xmas. Remember thought year bad celebrities died? WHY?? STOP.

&amp;#x200B;

At Oaks mall Thousand Oaks, report hundreds people gathering sing Christmas carols, many without masks, Levin said. Thanks kind words. don’t know answer questions, I’m eager find out. need science addressing mystery spillover event, need science communication making process, data, ideas visible public. Dallas you? in, near downtown suburb? know people Plano/Allen; rent better tech days there's good chance work remotely. Amen that! Tithing, version it, non-negotiable many kinds religious, socially minded. financial planner build in, bad financial planner. That's nothing compared deaths experience next weeks healthcare system lacks ICU capacity deal life-threatening illnesses emergencies.  one mass vaccination campaign's biggest hurdles getting untrusting public take new type vaccine. Even trust science, there's 20% population currently refusing take all, another 40% comfortable taking yet. Headlines like make 60% believe vaccine trustworthy. really hope vaccines help us get back close normal possible. Mask compliance NY public transit almost universal It’s “despite everything” part matters here. dropped ball, period. don’t care gets finger pointed them, finger pointing simply acknowledgement massively screwed want shift blame. exact formulation matters lot storing vaccine higher temperature. RNA notoriously unstable normal circumstances needs stored -80 (unless stored something stabilize it). Lol, drinking  “Overwhelmed hospitals”, “people dying street” somehow time plan dance. Ok.  Thank this! knowledge, never mRNA delivery method used humans effects even studied primates(long term is). unreasonable think could long-term effects? searched searching looking comparable found nothing. Feel free prove wrong thing found zika vaccine study done chimps using mRNA method. legit want know comparable study done show vaccine safe long-term.

What's point saying this?

There rational reason fear vaccine, one knows long term. read posts people saying %100 safe comparing anyone concern, matter small, idiot. think productive helpful getting compliance vaccine. think need acknowledge risk associated encourage civil discourse it.

Just two-cents. grounds? explained difference iterative open discovery scientific method, faith-based buffoonery Big-Pharma-COVID-Cult. 

If vaccine science ""settled"", operating dogmatic principles can't questioned - that's religion, science. Santa likes daddies lose jobs. people want vaccinated better don’t think de facto forcing vaccination happen, US. vulnerable immunity remainder access society must reopen, people already living despair lockdowns, many suffered missing routine health care, among social problems occurred. would foolish morally socially wrong continue living restrictions say March-June. US seems people want vaccine get one Q2. 

Europe hand...  That's whole point science, trust it. Go goddamn experiment see yourself. 

Science process, deity. feel you. I'm paramedic NYC. recently got called COVID+ interfacility transport, one months. Suddenly memories rushed back started crying way sending facility. CA still #40 nation cases deaths per million people. Despite population density still better lot states. dubia colony! plus ordering online great beardie ""eat/bite first, ask questions later"" tarantulas, best feeder cautious tarantulas. need use crickets good job keep crickets alive breeding them, buy shortly feed off. Thankfully, one pet shops town curbside pickup feeders, that's get crickets frozen rats/mice, still need go one pet shop get rest crickets. enough 100,000 end month (both Pfizer Moderna).

This really true. There’s 2.9m doses us right now. that’s Pfizer. Moderna likely similar expect 6m next weeks vaccinated. company guarantee US additional doses June 2021. 

Also untrue. Pfizer can’t deliver doses June Moderna order 100m June US. we’ll 150m people vaccinated almost guaranteed. shortfall roughly 100m assuming kids don’t get vaccine. JNJ AZ hopefully come in. not, we’re still pretty close. He's right using dollar amount decide pay behavioral finance standpoint, right one use majority people. 

People logical use works. See also, Weight Watchers vs CICO. Yes, sort CICO really, tackling behavior causes problem begin with. Ramsey. No, Az starting trials Sputnik vaccine. I’d prefer Pfizer vaccine Sputnik V tested outside Russia. point stands - know least 1, maybe more, 90%+ effective vaccines. would use factory, distribution, clinic etc resources vaccine leaves 4x many people unprotected? Shouldn’t vaccine falls short 90% simply shelved unless major advantages (like super cold, believe JJ vaccine meets makes ideal developing world) Don’t get many Microsoft shares give say that? 😂  /s vaccine I’m waiting for. able stay home?  actually might save house projects. Sometimes I'll work things kick lot dust might good breathe like usually do. Yes definitely is. rent problems main cities many tech companies coming bad outside that. home would possible CA.

I think could take one thing CA bring Texas would better public transportation trains.  Maybe 8 months ago would worthwhile, opting intrusive apps point really seem like great option. guinea pigs. vaccine thoroughly tested science backs it. excited mother, 60, receive see first time since 2019. thank you. great over. Spot on. ruined reputation entirely pandemic, point get annoyed time see Maria Tedros even Mike Ryan news. Contradictory, unhelpful, far behind curve every step way. Maybe try bring fucking child world midst global pandemic hospital resources limited pregnant women infants highly vulnerable? pure selfishness people intentionally trying kids right mind-blowing. I'm surprised want refuse vaccine - considered effect COVID might pregnant woman newborn? mention, idea state hospitals 9 months now. We're nearly year thing still reliable, constant sources PPE. can't fathom anyone thinks things ""good"" time kid. question restrictions placed refuse it.

Exactly this.

Getting vaccinated personal choice made responsible adults. responsible adults, simply deal consequences choice.

That might mean can't attend concerts, festivals, NFL games, Wrestlemania, TV tapings etc etc. asked simple fucking question curious calm tits never took personal attack.

k. someone works grocery store, neck gaiters fall wearer's face. I've customers pull gaiters throughout shopping trip. I've seen worn properly they're constantly touching face ""fix"" it. ones ear loops actually ok, majority time double layered....but bandana wrapped around face falls face. goes gaiter. One supervisors would wear two surgical masks gaiter top never fell down. 

Hope helps. sourced experience. 🤷‍♀️ US left think people find header perfectly normal. dm;hs covid mRNA vaccine typical vaccine. It’s new experimental. still possibility people react negatively it, entire clinical process rushed get emergency approval.

In end day, it’s putting experimental concoction one’s body there’s ambiguous risk associated that. It’s totally reasonable someone apprehensive it. 

Note: coming someone plans take vaccine soon it’s ready public use. mean lying would PR disaster taking vaccine, actual vaccine itself.

Not taking vaccine one thing (don't want cut line etc), lying taking vaccine another. lack confidence product would anti-vaxxer carnival. Pfizer would fucked regardless whether jab works not. Long term effects? None tested thats part process thats takes 10 years get approved normally. severe amount education lacking think there’s absolutely reason wary vaccine rushed together less year Yeah, horrible. wanna know hell ever thought ethical use POC essentially experiments. isn't. 

HIPAA blanket apply literally anyone. It’s Germany approving vaccine it’s European agency. that's left cause left yet. would worked without brexit.  difference trusting science phrase “I trust science” become meme point. It’s used political weapon. Mostly said people don’t really understand science, trust blindly. 


*this isn’t statement value science. It’s people use think science media, politics, etc... Sorry, mate can't fast-track procedure. actually monitor pharmacodynamics years series clinical trials determine long-term safety vaccines. 

In fact, whole point bureaucracy government trying protect potential responsibilities arising unintentional long-term side effects.

The government officials may decided potential risks worth taking combat global pandemic even waived legal responsibilities pharmaceutical companies Covid-19 vaccines, means public may less confidence Covid-19 vaccines vaccines. Amazing developed Germany they're far behind curve, time they're going another lockdown close holidays. Damn sure look overwhelmed work rn correct personally not. However, society does. meet obligations society get participate. 

Good day. That’s entirely true. polio vaccine made people infectious (although sick) year receiving it. worse year got run reindeer. Sweden reported 153 deaths. Last update Friday. nothing anecdotal evidence spoken several black people say they're interested vaccine trust it. grandmother particular stated trust black folks used guinea pigs past. guess bunch non-black people take adverse affects first might change mind? idea.

I understand lapse logic know well people change mind made up.  sarcastic, friend. :) 1. called **International** Certificate Vaccination Prophylaxis.
2. issued **World** Health Organization.
3. Since US part world still, also member WHO, International Certificate Vaccination Prophylaxis used documentation vaccination US citizens wish enter certain countries vaccination specific diseases mandatory entry. respect man audacity! medical doctors scientists?            

In 1960's two medical doctors independently told strenuous exercise bad health. 1990's any, few, doctors dared say exercise good health, marginalized saying so. course doctors discovered exercise good health, something figured 30 years prior.     

When last time practicing medical doctor (not online doctors like Dr. Jason Fung) told exercise stop eating lot junk food? true many people lazy irresponsible, medical profession helping much. yet people look guidance. Ah that’s Cali way, palliative care lots drugs. really wish could move case tracked thing, sign use hunt guns? put pile targets bait illegal? catch one year mount holster rack back pickup truck? also want loved ones guinea pigs. you? never took personal attack. really dude need calm tits. trust science. I'm sure trust potential political pressures forced vaccine through. Premature dancification.

3000 people dying every day. continue unabated least next 3 months. almost double coronavirus deaths US.

I see single reason dance.    Tell India think I've seen said immunity vaccine better getting covid see mean. would make sense immunize someone definitely immunity rather someone probably least immunity. don’t care it’s safest vaccine world... don’t authority force people consume chemicals know what’s inconvenient? Dying covid. isn’t game political decision, it’s life death Downvote guess. asking question too. wasn’t personally attacking Jesus fucking Christ. Thanks info! Hopefully, major breakthroughs therapeutics soon, something purge coronavirus infected. tin foil hat showing. already “suggested” Ticketmaster may need proof vaccination go concerts. US susceptible speculation Canada. 

In reality, compared rest developed world, US really wins “more freedom” comes guns. 

## Abstract

The worldwide pandemic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) posed substantial severe public health issue several generations, therapeutic options yet optimised. Vitamin (in “parent” form, cholecalciferol) proposed pharmacological management COVID-19 various sources. aimed determine whether COVID-19 mortality affected serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin status, cholecalciferol therapy, elucidate predictors COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised COVID-19 opportunistically recruited three UK hospitals, data collected retrospectively. Logistic regression used determine relationships COVID-19 mortality potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels cholecalciferol booster therapy. total 986 participants COVID-19 studied, 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. primary cohort 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy associated reduced risk COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment potential confounders (ORadj 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.35, *p* &lt; 0.001). finding replicated validation cohort 541 patients (ORadj 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.84, *p* = 0.018). observational study, treatment cholecalciferol booster therapy, regardless baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, appears associated reduced risk mortality acute in-patients admitted COVID-19. work large population studies needs carried determine adequate serum 25(OH)D levels, well multi-dose clinical trials cholecalciferol therapy assess maximum efficacy. [**View [**vitamin [**25-hydroxyvitamin [**vitamin [**novel coronavirus Thanks info! would make rude comment ability intellectual research? merely pointed surrounded non vaccinated people. fact. jerk. actually make good sleeping masks don’t wanna waste lol 

Moderna data ahead meeting Thursday. think ""prove"" anything religious exemption rule. That's part reason bullshit. Anyone claim something ""against religion."" side note: 52???? Wow! 99.97% survival rate hard argue with. Rational people lol. irrational blindly trust giant corrupt corporation like Pfizer pumped vaccine 9 months. also seeking immunity damages due vaccine. Don’t sheep bud, it’s ok sceptical  **No didn't.** vaccinated camera, said might help increase public’s willingness receive it, citing Pfizer’s internal research. emphasized “none executives board members cut line.” 

He theorizing. voted 100 people read article took comment fact. essence, anything would/should concern regular member public well. hahahahaahahahahahahaahha  Negative result 4 days before, easily pick 4 days Duly noted, expertise acknowledged. claim based previous studies baseless? 

Again, think I’m making point never fixated wanted debate. don’t care spreads least. Kids still spread disease aren’t implicated mask wearing public spaces. That’s all, that’s point was. Good. need shit mandatory. many nurses think know better actual scientists doctors needlessly endangering patients refusing vaccine. I'm glad hospitals least require it. Lots conspiracy could also taken placido look vaccine turn. Zoom call Santa? local thing? I'm googling there's many options! trust science. trust heartless corporations give fucks life safety planet. Fun fact: it’s illegal hunt whales Oklahoma. Still talking headlines I’m talking said loud. mentions vaccinated camera, said might help increase public’s willingness receive it, citing Pfizer’s internal research. emphasized “none executives board members cut line.”

So they're considering that, imagine issue start run people vaccinate risk. Lol we're free. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* First going whack mom, going whack me. ended whacking Go look exact timing stock dumps news releases.

They sit news months. Similar vaccines? first mRNA vaccine far I'm aware. pretty damn convenient find ""coincidence"" nearly *every* single science-denying conservative US also vehemently fundamentalist Christian. That's ""coincidence."" people naturally gullible easily manipulated, religious masses always throughout history. Blaming ""the government"" people's personal religious choices absurd, especially government rules everyone else well somehow turn conservative Christians, too. know people vote shitty politicians, right? *choose* gets government represent interests. Republican politicians magically appointed god. amount simultaneous ignorance arrogance comment astounding. literally said health care worker high risk, he's waiting turn. fucking read?

40% yes
44% yes later (not no)
15% pledged donate excess dosage poorer nations. (Not clear donating donation/sell combination), think wise over-buy. One candidate brought, Sanofi, already declared failure, remaining candidates produced results yet. Even succeed, buying means get delivered quickly. clearly doesn’t trust vaccine 🧐 absolutely care 200k. get 200M altruistic. got rich they're inherently greedy want miss opportunity make/keep amount $$$ guy literally trying get recognized ""good deed"". There's nothing brave this. probably even worried Covid like 95% people know reason since he's CEO looks like humble person world. agree struggle! beginning year, needed lot reminders persuasion. Parenting hard even normal times, much empathy parents.

Here’s difference: Parents value mask wearing continue put effort, even kid stubborn. they’ll keep kid home, also fine. Parents don’t value mask wearing, like family article, say “She won’t wear it! There’s nothing do!” expect accommodated. Hopefully Cali transplants leave 2020 taught US education system failed teach respiratory illness facism. Vaccine coming, Santa!!!! wouldn’t say it’s non-issue. wore masks screened people (maybe extent now) long everywhere else did. you’re immuno-compromised, every disease pandemic. I’m sorry, sarcastic, silly. Since put ? end “oh” completing question: “Oh, really?” Bad humor. apologies. Definitely not. family important thing life child. seeing idiots around capable completely fucking everything up. saw days coming 20 years ago, preparing whole Goddamn time. Conspiracy theorists run wild this. oh god know bad take place work nightmares! :( i've dreams i'm scared people around wearing masks. really sucks stressful is. sad saying following:

* Bill Gates put chips vaccine

will get banned Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook labeled crazy person.

But saying following:

* Bill Gates developed vaccine control/sterilize/or whatever Black people.

will seen healthy skepticism historical racism. equally insane cost lives. fuck add page lol number plus fact nursing homes patients wiped whole considering places society puts self sufficient old people waiting die reinforce idea virus problem elderly. really put effort talking consequences full hospitals, happening now, covering this. Pure pandering. Yeah, I'm still sure 100% understand he's saying.  mom concerned thinks rushed. every article I've read says completely safe. thing know long vaccine last. vaccine. I'd rather go 92 year old father-in-law first sure would rather every family. endless supply stuff. know take two doses. admirable thing reddit losing mind it. suspicious. Especially light sold 60% stock day vaccine announcement. Wat Fucking idiotic parents potentially harming kids entire families. American.   doesn’t make want get it. people saying insane. Yeah shitty situation tough decisions are/need made, definitely envy anyone make choices. wording ridiculous That’s true. what’s visiting? There’s tons going (normally)  Two year olds capable wearing masks. two (now three) year old wore fine- understood part safe get used it. know others whose kids wear masks fine. 

Mostly, don’t feel sorry people, stop traveling pandemic acting like inconvenienced. INCONVENIENCED right now. , instead claim Pfizer going tanked faulty vaccine, already distributed millions doses. It’s actually kind cute naive are. Shit I’d rather go field hospital back nursing home Don’t convinced that’s better. In-hospital network means another hospital could 10 miles away open ICU beds, referring facility hold ICU bed hospital comes open. Meaning bed charge rather allowing get one much faster consequently losing money on. Suuurrrre did. mean it’s pretty logical seeing hospitalizations still increasing isn’t even Christmas yet. think peak? I’m confused point Haha true! finally better! Nah don’t disagree! states, living former presidents going get it, Biden absolutely well. remove comment mine too.  People vote. Personal info:

Daughter culinary director assisted living tested weekly staff 

Best friend home care nurse tested direct contact patient covid weekly patient death discharge home care tested symptomatic 

Friend works ICU hospital tested known, direct exposure symptomatic HIGHLY DISCOURAGED ask testing 

All three places greater Des Moines area

The one performing proper procedure Assisted Living. someone director many assisted livings actually shock awe administrator ever worked great man been. two places failing. Miserably. think second mess even close people. ""2 weeks flatten curve"" never people pretending now. one would ever make claim anything zero side effects, short term long term.

Nobody waits forever see possible effects releasing drug.

That’s science works. need start teaching stuff schools. saying case everyone someone recent remission, haven’t issues maintenance pet, ct, blood work, visits scheduled. issue loss healthcare benefits due position eliminated spring depressed job market proving challenging find employment again. think funny questioning ability understand definition display inability so. can't pick concept definition use justification. consider theme laid words around especially.... know... ""other words""... heard ""other words"" right? Sorry unaware people could allergic reaction it. Ohhhh, wanna cut line EXCEPT paycheck! Drones stay back line. Thanks this! one fear mongering someone hoping stay relevant longer rational response.  Babahahahahaha. knows. know. gullible provaccine group understand science. Hahahahahahahah want cut line wait thousand take vaccine?


Perhaps waiting study data side-effects detail volunteering self! Seems counterintuitive pump extra CO2 people struggling keep blood oxygen levels. case normally optimistic person. However, way Americans dealt pandemic appalling don’t think get vaccinated. means lockdowns don’t open up. didn’t dispute article it’s validity- called random bearing topic all. doesn’t cover single aspect what’s currently going country right now. It’s literally discussing efficacy wearing mask.

I’m well read, thank much. mean posting unrelated articles means instantly fall line thought. What’s supposed mean? gonna vaccinations lagging indicator.

Leading indicator? want play front actual audience watch sing dance. single soul say Cuomo killed tens thousands mean learn people power decided potential pandemic wasnt problem playbook thrown completely ignored. think biggest travesty even gotten serious has, still ignore it, nothing help citizens it. That's biggest travesty care lining pockets isnt global pandemic they've used propaganda tool continue nothing people they're robbing blind. read ended debunked. years. 
Like anti vax horror stories.


We're worried healthy young adult death rate fucking idiot. common sense would least affected.


""Are young healthy white males dying? "" 
""no""
""Well fuck dont need vaccine like poor africans""  also completely ignoring thousands people point taken vaccine fine

The argument Dad keeps making ""I can't wait see messed human race 10 years."" think he's certain there'll something pop long-term tested 2 years something.

I can't stand it, he's stern silently nod. Wish could tell off. actors Start fans page Actually opposite true. knows effectively final stage clinical trials testing. part sausage made. similar laser eye surgery. concerned safety, want wait comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

Also work RNA infamously capricious.

Good optimistic thinking. much better opposite, case, assumption accurate. much focused infections. fact, doctors forwarding suspected infections investigating pretty thoroughly. point time it’s really happening statistically relevant numbers warrant much concern. 

Medical anomalies happen time. lot time immunocompromised people sometimes asymptomatic low viral loads don’t produce adequate antibody protection. patients simply Covid “long haulers” experiences relapses. There’s lot reasons infections could happening time remains anomaly. answer?

Do right government job?  Covid slaughtered them, like animals remained state moved far lower tax areas. loss. written past tense effect, *effected*. past tense used, implies previous state being. *”My opinion effected by....”*, statement past would necessary say “effected” (created) opinion. *”This article effected opinion”*, also statement past it’s also necessary say opinion really finish statement. 

In example, using present tense, *effecting*. say *”This article effecting opinion”*, (or *”This article creating opinion”*), correct someone actual act reading it. I’d guess it’s extremely uncommon every day speech. 

The sentence responding hope comes senses lot respect person effected opinion him.

This wrong sentence use “effect”, sense create. someone respect, must already formed opinion. Plus it’s past tense, means opinion formed past. 

So it’s proper use “affect”.  restriction followed?!

Small businesses grin bear another shit storm power life saving burn out?!! seems framing comment misleading way. basically said government authority (FDA) unanimously agree. said way would lead person ask ""Well government can't make minds trust them?"".

Maybe unintentionally, sitting outdoor bar 6 feet away said that, would assume want trust FDA. People forget know good got it. believe fake conspiracy. This. Please, folks, don’t feed trolls/morans light really damn far us. Remember healthcare support workers like dietary housekeeping constant risk exposure, getting vaccines well financially valuable staff. I'm dietetic intern rumor non-clinical food nutrition workers might get passed foreseeable future. official hospital statement leftover staff get wait list late January guaranteed access anything. I'm expecting frontline workers department see vaccine February March best all. Priority access mean anything one sets aside supply you. Social distance, gloat, kind support staff. people going risking lives quite awhile longer. That's virus doesnt mutate deadly strain. We've lucky, far, deadly strain emerge could easily shoot past Spanish flu numbers. happened spanish flu, way. second wave absolutely brutal. truly poetic first state run ICU beds annual contender dumbest state USA. going things long. article even say that? one friends PhD working viruses covid told us get first batch vaccines since mRNA new territory....so I'm unsure. makes sense tho, first batch iPhones, PS5, Tesla's, issues.. articles individuals long term affects. know people worried kids covid even though articles like exceedingly rare instance able write article circumstances individual. real issue, talking specific cases, would talking statistics counts. Looks like heard immunity Lacks thing happen people color? experimentation like commonplace? seem recall common practice perform gynecological exams women anesthetized women learning hospitals. I’ve taking pointless rambling sub. There’s going difficult distinction public risk personal risk needs struck. Personally I’m anything indoors requires mask March April. see young healthy people use lowered hospitalizations pass whatever want. Let's real, pandemic going year. Hell, even five years, third world country probably still afflicted. definitely become new normal, since people country getting proper vaccine anytime soon. surprised quarantine ends decade passes we're still wrestling virus. yes, masks become new normal be. 

And ""you people?"" Care elaborate? fair question. believe hospital capacity. another pointed out, person 90s likely need hospital bed get someone 60s. less hospital beds taken up, beds emergencies illnesses (CVA, heart attacks, cancer, etc...) REAL Santa immune. Imposters catch Covid-19. parents explain fake Santa kids. young kids never issue. wonder first time approached put mask on. Maybe never that's rebelled. I'm judging wondering. I’m far conspiracy theorist you’ll find admit news potential contain bullshit. you’re trying altering narrative

Sorry took way, wasn’t intention. pointing link provided seemed according sources. give daily death number idea think, besides wildly 1k. Call devils advocate cause country fallen badly. Jesus alive today walked water Redditors would make fun knowing swim. take vaccine, it’s lose lose. 

Nobody earth would complained head company producing first vaccine global pandemic took vaccine insure safety. mention amount vaccination hesitancy current conversation, knew would headline literally doesn’t want get it. concerning it’s alright point out. Plot Twist: sterilization injection

PS: REFERRING TV SHOWS PLOT LINE : referring TV show Utopia !&lt; actually yes they've said verbatim ""at least covid huge survival rate know what's vaccine."" I'm even kidding you. mad though. He's CEO makes sense.  make though same: boredom free-floating anxiety led road. line even yet. Sorry, fact everyone even obsessed decision super important right shows lot... Guess arent allowed optimism knowing vaccine beat virus US. actually yes they've said verbatim ""at least covid huge survival rate know what's vaccine."" I'm even kidding you. cool love story. Sunday Monday always lowest days week US though. trend continues I'm scared almost hit 3500 daily today tomorrow.

That said, original comment counting Worldometers, look US already 308K. rise 38.5K. Unfortunately, know nurses trust Facebook YouTube science. whole point number needed treat NNT, correct?

Yes, people die wearing seat belts. emphasize people die seat belt wearing eidemic car crashes seem like helpful thing emphasize, someone still gave platinum award best thing. 

We human beings, understanding probability flawed. perceive taking action (vaccinating wearing seat belt) way strong move *not* taking action. perceive blameless taking action, blame take action. that's wrong perception based flawed human psychology. 

We must work every day fight tendency see world distorted perception risk blame. Please point science says addiction beneficial society. moment pain killers save lives, addiction poor government handling opioid crisis caused issue hence companies pay out. preaching cars invented cars 0 automobile deaths every auto accident blamed science left psych unit. think I’ll upvote article need see it. parents whining district going remote week, kids need in-person learning, etc. people championed exclusion elementary students school district mask mandates. choose 100% virtual option due decision child attention issues zero sympathy them. agree COVID deaths people many years voting left Hmm. Conspiracy theorists 3, 2, 1.... understand saying. I'm sorry auntie died, I'm sure would find funny seem to. Finland also recommendation 10 day isolation Lol need vaccine. Almost cases asymptomatic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Calling people irrational, wonder CEO top people producent company wont take vaccine? difference thinking irrational thinking sceptical something weird. “We dont want cut line”. Lol. 

You cant call people irrational dont trust govornment 100%, like rational people 😉 obviously both. I've never let kids believe mythical creatures, flat told true. Let others try convince otherwise, time crystalize what's real. always feared tooth fairies santas gateway drugs religious belief see people think kids can't fun fulfilled withouth believing bullshit. believe point, economic social impacts keeping distancing requirements outweigh benefits. you’ve mitigated possibility widespread deaths, lose justification even restrictions. one trusts CrispR technology. What's difference 'emergency use' 'vaccine ok go'? I’d disagreed saw executives acted. Really sketchy see turn half-baked line cutting justification. Oh? hadn’t heard that, that’s great news. know pregnant women excluded Pfizer trial, typical new trials.  reason scientific method succeeded long scientists trust results scientists forced community replicate results actually trusting results. Disgusting. don’t know say that. course gaitors don’t work people don’t keep Welp, guess 2 approved.

But anyone idea what's going AstraZeneca US? looking approval January what? know J&amp;J getting phase 3 data January. Good. Time get moving one well. We're getting closer closer end damn thing.  That’s interesting insight different what’s communicated. gone ""no comment"" take without telling anyone. winning move play. Tomorrows news (probably) :

Americans go see doctor ate many LED lights. I'm NYC area work healthcare. nurses talked want either trust vaccine coming fast already covid believe antibodies would sick hearing that? People right ask questions CEO company said unsure stops transmission pertinent point needs discussed. cant swept rug. agree you--to extent. trust virologists PhD's infectious disease docs nurses took one 200-level immunology course 10 years prior even remember difference innate adaptive immunity, let alone never received education reading clinical trials. 

I got FB debate RN several flawed logic/debunked talking points vaccine. immensely discouraging see number fellow RNs chimed similar rhetoric. friend mine nurse straight say ""if get vaccine, guarantee baby born without lungs?"" flabbergasted.

Medical professionals free concern new vaccines, somehow seem ignore virus could also harbor long-term effects, like ya know, HPV causes 95% cervical cancer women. 
From article: currently evidence variant likely cause severe COVID-19 infections, scientists said, would render vaccines less “Both questions require studies performed pace,” COG-UK scientists said. already know approved, approve now? legally require certain amount time submission study approval? think could tweaked emergency situation like this. covid over, get plan child's future climate collapse water wars! real. People acting like 2 year olds act rationally time, throw tantrums bad parenting? 2 year old meltdown yesterday accidentally ripped paper coloring on, can’t control emotions well age think you’re missing point. NYE gatherings. help worsening situation. Gets downvoted literally insane.

Long-term side effects monitored phase 4 clinical trials, phase monitoring market role out. you’ll see pamphlets change medications time. 

Also FYI mRNA vaccines years study behind them. existed decade prior covid haven’t demand backing used vaccine scale. 

The clinical trials done cobs vaccine included standard phase 1, 2, 3 subject peer review process publication. really lack administrative delays hurdles plus seemingly endless funding reason vaccine went quickly Well, hopefully know something risk long haul post covid issues. People literally 6+ months still issues walking age. I'm late 30s, 70 days first symptoms, still can't run marathon training got disease. i'm going take vaccine, never want disease again. That's simply true. Congress fails extend relief part new stimulus package discussed lawmakers, many lenders likely curtail loan modification programs, said, making life much tougher many 12 million Americans whose unemployment benefits due expire around time.

'eduacate yourself' go answer people learning capacity seems. sister ER nurse. said survey said exact thing. One doctors presentation explained data allowed ask questions things happened side effects etc. answered questions, afterward, 100% nurses saw presentation chose sign vax.

It amazing lack knowledge huge barrier actually remedied. hope doctors take time protect nurses educating them. mixed bag, really smart many average Joe. need help education order protect themselves. way assuming waiting bit means pretty much yes split. difference typed logic explaining thought way (which completely ignored). Unless detailed information links poll site show, that's make educated guesses ""a bit"" means.

But yes, getting Americans stay course social mitigation measures gonna *huge* freakin’ challenge. Totally confidence inspiring, regardless that's genuine motive not. mean, seriously. saying wont hurry get it, eventually probably will. work literally every hour every day? No? shut hell up. Medical workers people believe not. robots get feel human sometimes entitled, spoiled, obtuse, man child. must absolute chore friends family. Lmao probably knows businesses requiring proof vaccination. Clearly never licked OPs aunt Free elves  Maybe he's afraid needles? going injected everyone world 

It's hilarious think powerful people earth getting exact vaccine lowly nurses doctors get. Agree, posts cannot deviate title article per rules (and enforce it). Publisher one need BS. Two people science science always said excersise beneficial certain level. think gym class supported science 90s? Extreme excersise detrimental lead injury stress know medical history cannot speak situation. 

You make great discovery known human history hahaha. Next saying figured fruits vegetables better eating candy 70s health crazes late 2000s scientists caught on. Remember good old days science discouraged excersize protested olympics major league sports, good times.

My doctor told excersize overweight. show healthy without issues assume already know high cholesterol overweight tell everytime sometimes even recommend nutritionist help. parents get told every year changing diets physicals, sounds like going real doctors bud friend Kreg got new mutated COVID-19 couple nights ago. woke morning, dick fell off. wary everyone idle mind devil's playground. wonder timing impacted inability get extra Pfizer doses. Isn’t quote coat photographed wearing AF1 landed, think one camps kids cages? think would struggle get spot line both, especially since states tracking vaccinations statewide vaccination databases ensure get second dose correct manufacturer. pay second vaccine type solely pocket, find someone willing administer ""already vaccinated"" individual.  Don’t show comment dream fans won’t get vaccinated Yeah, went college chemistry intimate familiarity vaccine science. scientific literacy hold opinion do. first round vaccines may prevent infection spread. Combine people’s already demonstrated unwillingness observe mask social distancing guidelines it’s hard imagine surge people going following guidelines assumption pandemic vaccine widely available. vaccine also doesn’t provide perfect protection “efficacy” level touted almost certainly come gather data get substantially larger sample size. rollout real phase III. language poll simple as, “yes would wait bit getting it,” done make wild assumptions, generalizing broad nonspecific group people think it’s important first line. would use one state one.

The fact national one beginning painfully incompetent. I'm Nigerian hearing Phizer behind vaccine actually make ass happy. mean there's whole Tuskegee stuff American history [something lil recent. there's actually good reason lot people suspicious apprehensive. I'm anti-vax slightest could continue WFH, isolate, mask up... might wait see ends happening people anything. dad ICU, bill added cool $50K per day. that's counting transport specialists labs. I'm wondering rate medical debt bankruptcies going side this. know tests covered (right?) treatment severe case?

ETA: Dad COVID; years ago. Anime you’re brave enough. 2020 coming! Get choppa!  Thank continued commitment care patients. significant risk exposed COVID testing center? i'm looking going drive-up testing location area get tested seeing mother cancer weekend. husband seems think risky going testing center sick, symptomatic people are. i'd agree going urgent care, i'm drive-up seems safer given open air? 

i know. i'm going precaution deal unmasked folks mechanic last week. I’m already person. It’s going well. would love get vaccine quickly, others take priority. Yup next months going worst Wishful thinking happen. vaccine available general public everyone wanted get vaccine got it, public stop wearing mask. way public comply mask requirement got vaccine. totally unrealistic expectation read possible fertility effects? neither links really said anything Stay home grandpa horizon, confirmed second half year.  probably go ahead remove letters “T, A, R, I” name. opposite? Maybe I'm one understand. Yes. would nice symbolic vote confidence. getting really take away someone else considering need set aside doses internal uses anyway. Would hurt try get both? Oxford MUCH cheaper produce distribute, since shelf-stable; I've seen targeted tropical third-world countries without widespread refrigeration infrastructure. Efficacy counts actually get person's arm goes bad. NJ's governor compared dimmer switch rather traditional switch light. all. Moderna shipping 100m months April June. It’s like, oh here’s June 30, time ship 100m doses. 

Trump screwed up. also didn’t hedge bets single vaccine good. get you’re saying almost every country picked orders spent way per dose AZ seemed front runner time. it’s not, put us behind. contrast priority Moderna’s vaccine candidate order. good bad. That's true enough people vaccinated everywhere. fear communities remain vulnerable, virus around long time still. pandemic, outbreak there.

Fortunately still solve main problem have, overflowing hospitals Yeah screw impoverished people grew delta way chance know better. Pharmacists lining take either. rushed market, suitably tested, due nature coronaviruses potential nasty side effects.  
Most people know understand vaccine development process waiting see guinea pigs fare awhile first. jive though look SoCal record number cases. Weather pretty nice. 60s 70s. disagree. nursing homes still quarantine. Yes sucks, perfectly quarantined nursing home risk catching virus. Especially vaccinate healthcare workers work there. don’t know nursing homes reacting right now, uncle hasn’t exposed anybody medical workers since March. healthcare workers cannot quarantine nature job. nurses pass without realizing it, could end infecting people sick health issues high risk. healthcare workers go back normal environment, they’ll keeping many people safe. Obviously nursing homes healthcare workers 1 2 everybody’s list. Elderly absolutely next up, think healthcare workers go first. Hopefully talking couple weeks difference. Someone arm battle ahead Absolutely love plan. vaccine, current knowledge, reduce transmission much all. reduces severity symptoms. 

You could vaccine healthy young people want. makes mild asymptomatic cases even mild asymptomatic. 

The vaccine intended vulnerable people would hospitalized/die severe cases covid-19... Yeah, makes sense. There's way went 12-13k cases day 7500 hospitalizations jumped dramatically. Really looking forward week's numbers. :(

Edit: btw, Abbot Labs location outbreak list wonder there's connection there. millions doses, agree, one dose doesn’t matter. aren’t though asking EMTs run people’s houses... people deserve first shot vaccination important nonbelievers. still 0 sum game kids died mixing vodka caffeine pills. state federal official stuff forced resign shame dishonor. show bias preference one system another, prove one inherently trusted other. Can't fucking wait! sure short periods time, reality, one staff long run. 

reality though time, much full lead believe.  still wearing masks social distancing, naturally.

Safety measures going away least couple years  Oh hear Kaiju. Terrible occurrence.  Goal posts keep moving, wow. live Glendale, CA people don’t care. 9/10 people refuse properly wear mask cause either “cant breathe” hoax dont care. Public malls still open ridiculous amount people going them. curfew 10pm one follows. point idk needs happen Glendalians care, flip flopping almost closed almost open really doesnt work. need full lockdown, that’ll never happen make better I’m totally wrong every right come back go “ha! wrong!”.  But, Florida Miami right? North, cooler. Orlando looks 60's, 70's.

I mean, live SoCal. 80 degrees last week. 70s today. seeing record case numbers. think weather explanation go far.... That’s good way look it, cheers man. They're trying keep NSA. flu season... keep wearing mask Cheesesteak. See? say random words too! Yes, per week. first vaccine supposedly 50 million doses (or, 100 million, two-dose). many total one have? need get total ~300 million people treated. determine whether it’s on-the-job exposure community acquired? contact tracing, hadn’t thought employers privy (though I’m different state may true CA), another means? I’m genuinely curious. wasn’t talking about. Again, saying US didn’t fuck it’s pretty obvious did. it’s also pretty obvious US institutions transparent regarding reporting accurate numbers Chinese government. point root question. Oxford requires 2 shots. believe J&amp;J added arm trial that’s going look 2 doses may internal concerns one shot enough. far understand it, vaccines doesn’t prevent virus reproducing. chance happening likely remains same, virus everything reproduce. vaccine helps body identify quicker/better, less time reproduce killed off.

 length time get killed/suppressed point non-viable less time takes become symptomatic/transmissible, actions won’t occur. 

Atleast that’s layman understanding. degree. think use position get vaccinated front line medical workers? Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg get too? woman 52?? pictures mask on, thought she’d 20s. likely downvoted hell, ""big pharma"" actually lots good. government worked hard make scapegoats things wrong US healthcare back 90s stuck.

There many, many excellent scientists pharma companies. companies collaborate closely academic government researchers bring science forward turn research viable drug vaccine. Many life-saving and/or disease treating drugs developed, especially past 30 years.

It widely reported known big pharma also gives drugs away poor countries poor residents US. think putting money health totally agree. idea stroke victim old young middle-aged. assuming, may may correct.

Are people buses, subways? spreads there. pay money study. Correct, may increase inflammatory response little, shouldn’t effect strong traditional adjuvants. question mom could run allergist, based FDA guidelines, she’d eligible receive vaccine it’s turn. 


I know two allergic reactions England got lot attention, think it’s important keep mind two allergic reactions ~40,000 actually extremely low number. That’s lower rate allergic response foods, example, certainly far lower pharmaceuticals. intervention free risk, seems risks you’re reasonably likely encounter vaccines feeling like crap couple days. Yes people use transit don’t choice oven distancing often know. gloves deep cleaning, though even little May/June looked time like things beginning normalize.

None believed different meaningful way. introductions vaccines may spur evolution vaccine avoiding strains, time strains differ meaningfully.  U.S. residents, anyone know state travel restrictions allow stopping states get gas pee? I'm planning skiing Vermont cross maybe 4 states long drive.

I'll pee woods ditch needed avoid people. guidance? happily wear everyone risk vaccinated vaccine proven effective. 

ITS BIG ASK. accelerated Ready Player One dystopian future everyone lives trailer need space everything virtual? sure hope Thanks heads up. Turns graph looking wrong (possibly disinformation). Don’t know downvoted much right. Probably Lefty Britain bashers downvoting you. swim around piles money day like Scrooge McDuck Apologies implied take vaccine based articles. will, not, depending professionals assess efficacy safety months come. lot concerns came uncertainty vaccine contained, quickly produced.

I took break work looked vaccine's details (""BNT162B2"" would like same). Allergic reaction appears biggest risk factor. Aside currently reason believe unsafe, Pfizer provides list ingredients consumers. 

My remaining concern RNA portion, since seems relatively new. One thing look guess. Thank motivating explore new rabbithole. [Article November Wartime loss would say much sooner that. Remember several vaccines weeks away approval targeted delivery towards elderly, death rate would plummet. 

I think beginning normal death rate matches flu we've reached herd immunity. 

My wife's hospital already sent notices signing first batch vaccines. I'd imagine nursing homes also short list vaccines. think need shut much winter ride out. though lot people going needlessly get sick die. Laughed hard 😂 Hand several million dollars write article obvious answer.

I take checks credit cards. statement June correct, since even agreed June Moderna eta Pfizer. Trump screwed trying nickel dime get bare minimum.  virtual event Centre Strategic International Studies, Dr Fauci said believe ""we're going able throw masks away forget physical separation congregate settings while, probably likely get late fall early next winter,"" said. Dr Fauci said ending pandemic would like ""turning light switch off,"" emphasised would take time things return normal, even release distribution coronavirus vaccine . Dr Fauci predicted individuals without underlying conditions would likely begin receiving drug late March early April, assuming significant distribution delays. mean time, Dr Fauci health experts urging Americans continue social distancing using masks, forgo large family gathering holiday season. [Summary] think cancer good example potential death, necessarily good example long-term health consequences. Consider instead:

- person needs treatment delayed, loses limb result.
- person needs treatment delayed, recovers permanent lung/heart/brain damage.
- person needs treatment delayed, exacerbating conditions driving somewhat reasonable medical bill certain bankruptcy. 

Death certainly scary, means thing fear kinds situations. Even macroeconomic picture, thousands upon thousands people permanent disabilities, dire. Arent Hospitalizations record everywhere?  No, void warranty. thought 70%?

Or difference herd immunity ""true"" herd immunity? plenty reasonable arguments mandatory vaccines, “humans fit free will” isn’t one them. yeah there's evidence prove either, saying ""it appears happen"" correct Hurry da fuck FDA...... *sigh* know pfizer chose use different lipid coating? RIGHT PLEASE person accurate Yes. Ethical requirement. Batch number etc., needs recorded case issues line. March betting AstraZeneca, Pfizer moderna seemed lagging behind. Even amazing fast worked Disease nature unfair. There's evidence prove transmission happen. Even scientists developed know even commented low. know less 1 foot away I'm probably catching it. packed bar, I'm catching it. Normal life would still cause asymptomatic transmission. it. Pretend true abandon preventative measures. question whether intend resign, thought it.

What liar. buffoon. studies could confirm treatment got much better limited trials, also scale, especially last weeks strained hospitals dry indoor air? Hopefully recovers persuade others wrong. Sounds like know vaccine authorized next. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article covid's high R0 we're going need +70% hit herd immunity. 

Remember, sigmoid threshold covid actually WORSE ... like linear thing. hits cliff way worse. 

You read come? got vaccine trial, get placebo time

uhh why? beauty new vaccinations development require spike protein produce effect. minor tweak want prolonged testing period again. certainly panic regardless outcome. taking measures protect anyway Right, think people severely underestimate easy protect public, definitely underestimate stupid general population is. recall saying that, sentiment vaccine rushed point arriving election day always thought problematic. trump et al even still pressuring FDA week ago hurry up, one imagine much pressure tried exert october rush conclusions.

do honestly believe millions americans would use excuse taking vaccine? give soon vice president far credit even one would give soon ex president Bill Gates wants put nanobots pisshole... One thing I’m confused about. two months data requirement FDA mean two months 40000th shot? there's evidence I’m no. I’m excited vaccines. wish time. I’m worried side effects don’t know about. I’d hate get find years can’t kids crazy shit.  know call guy graduated last law school, don'tcha?

Lawyer. Thanks! hesitant first, reading feel good it. I’m surprised many people facility declining get it; little concerning Im pretty happy part absolutely get saying. time would volunteer guinea pig pregnant? certainly wouldn't. ask question: person already Covid (and recovered) point getting vaccine?

Yes... probably. we'll probably need boosters ever 1-5 years. 

Not super urgent already though. Probably wait others receive it. 

Remember, people getting vaccinated MAY actually better you, personally, receiving vaccine.

Front line workers huge disease vector wrong person getting covid pass natural immunity different immunity caused vaccine ?

We know yet think best answer. early papers nothing long term data. That's another reason prefer masks. I'm 6'5 320 lbs plus stupid resting angry face people said I'm scary talk first time even though I've never angry violent person entire life. masks make people get hear say prejudging me. They're going able get red tape testing then. probably right. Thanks info. It’s actually two months median participant vaccinated, last. telling Swedish public epidemic basically over?

You around long enough know exact opposite that. fact, said likely *never* over. Eh, virus mutates changes structure spike proteins we'll see new variants it. Remains seen though. know finished enrollment? remember reading got reduced 60k 40k I’ve read others say end December feasible initial readout. Oh get important point. one care beyond little world. masks, distancing. know get severely sick COVID fuck everything else. Back time whatever want do.  Well thanks kind thinking people able live normal lives still since vaccine proven grant true immunity. Nope. I'm starting now. neither basically everyone else. Unlike people... cough cough... politicians downplayed handled virus horribly... cough cough nonsense. reason people see baby. Get tested, isolate, visit confirmed negative. done make people uncomfortable purpose. good reason keep people safe. pushback made even worse, health standpoint economic standpoint.

If nuclear fallout sit bunker couple years, would say screw run get radiated government said shouldn't? Think they're trying oppress you?

It's 9 months. People act like 9 years. barely year since whole thing hit USA get things less back ""normal"". hard ask. I've isolated whole time, short going grocery store, visiting friends/family local park beach away crowds. I've also work whole year well, single parent two young kids. I've made sacrifice too, would rather wear damn mask another months ensure get job keep family safe run recklessly pretending like nothing ever happened.

I agree managed better government hough. Lockdown without financial compensation dumb, part brainer. Pay people sit home couple months, whole thing would less history. See Australia. Yeah, right. top epidemiologist country less knowledgeable Reddit commenters. Fuck science Fauci! Masks hurt freedom!

🦅🦅🦅 lawsuit what, primary care outpatient getting cold? mean yeah. would generally healthy people take vax going force us suffer like anyways. I’m taking vax 100%%!!! need people board fact taking get life back. That’s motivate people. aren’t going motivate anyone saying still grandma never get cold again. people aren’t altruistic. can't wait. kept job pandemic I've saved much money shopping going eat/drink, can't wait spend haha. want see movies theater, go sporting events, go drink bar without even looking prices menu! us too. it’s it’s too. I’ve done part brink sacrificing mentally monetarily. That’s it. don’t get anymore. I’m seeing friends family, holding art shows traveling. I’m old. Two years life huge chunk, it’s asking much. don’t think it’s okay shame people either. We’ve done reasonably point. I’ve said beginning 100% fault governments, people. 

You cannot realistically ask 300 million people interact indefinite period time. fucking universe realistic? Coworker Moderna trial. said side effects “brutal.” also said 24 hours later abating 48 hours later fine. anyone wants pass Moderna shot gladly take place line. 48 hours feeling like shit better able breathe. Exactly, don’t understand.

He’s sick random people telling smile (and often actually happen?)...so he’s going everybody asking doens’t take mask off? sub would someone want risk getting COVID getting COVID vaccine.

I got flu shot October, outside masked up. Safe assume yes... key data trial data knowing % people infected, died, etc. They're 95% effective. 

You get bit ill like mild cold both. Feel like crap day - better dying passing on. 

They 90-95% effectiveness. It’s wonderful idea hats people came put idea.

Fair point. shorthand I've referring Pfizer, that's absolutely correct refer BioNTech &amp; Pfizer.

For purposes discussion, mostly differentiation Moderna (aka Moderna &amp; NIH). We're talking reducing deaths hospitalizations 4%. talking 97%. Stop fear-mongering spreading misinformation. stay home I'm sick. also get consistent allergies, pretty much always ""have sniffles"".

Not gonna mask it. Lol odd one commenting fact video article nothing headline.

It's surprise given Independent. suspect reporting says might bit well though. thought 2020 would awesome year cause number twice problem people really “in” coronavirus. post questions might call question covid’s supremacy society immediately met barrage downvotes.  Never panic, that's sure. monitoring this, testing extensively region see far spread, vaccinate people see protected new mutation follow testing.

A quarantine keep people traveling region probably good idea least initially know problem not. money problem, mutation resistant vaccine starting deploy, start panic.

And that, mean TOTAL lockdown region, travel out, exceptions, period, strain dies out. can't risk throwing away last year's work vaccine ANOTHER covid screw us last minute. Wealthcare healthcare Agreed. hopeful day return. throwing baby bath water say “no concerts. even loud music restaurants” like OP seems want check RT live, states 1 pretty damn close ones much higher. matter give range there's chance even states actually going getting worse

RT live says also take note RT magnitude (The raw number cases given state). ones dropping right ones peaked somewhere vicinity ""we ICU beds available weeks"" would make sense could handle testing/treatment volume long. gives small glimmer hope, called schedule plasma donation booked solid entire week(I scheduled next week). many people Los Angeles &lt;3 support pretty much two things can: donating blood, spending days naked couch eating cheetohs watching Netflix. Oh must missed part. would amazing. hope want make vaccine mandatory. Why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Once upon time, would said no, assuming people would take responsibility. 2020 along COVID-19, disproved nearly that. people work public, weakest link becomes liability safety concern everyone else. vaccine people choose take it, virus time spread adapt mutate. need everyone board, mandated, it.

&amp;#x200B;

The people tell vaccine safe work people said COVID hoax 1% less everyone dies (despite math checking out, repeatedly months). people kept claiming coronavirus worse flu. people gathered around dinner table large families groups friends Thanksgiving, 4th July, every major holiday year (Christmas New Years' around corner, likely plans too). -- No, many (not you) cannot trusted make good choices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those people kept arguing ""herd immunity,"" given chance experience ""herd immunity"" vaccine, going people shout loudest opposing vaccine. I'm convinced either want watch world burn know world work (perhaps both). Maybe want work differently, nature science work around 'feel' 'think.' cannot ""will"" so. said, many (not you) cannot trusted make good choices.

But digress. YES, think excellent idea make vaccine mandatory! much good hopeful? light end tunnel, ramp will. Thank fucking god.

“ I’ve vaccinated, still need wear mask?

Yes, forever. Here’s why. coronavirus vaccines injected deep muscles stimulate immune system produce antibodies. appears enough protection keep vaccinated person getting ill. what’s clear whether it’s possible virus bloom nose — sneezed breathed infect others — even antibodies elsewhere body mobilized prevent vaccinated person getting sick.

The vaccine clinical trials designed determine whether vaccinated people protected illness — find whether could still spread coronavirus. Based studies flu vaccine even patients infected Covid-19, researchers reason hopeful vaccinated people won’t spread virus, research needed. meantime, everyone — even vaccinated people — need think possible silent spreaders keep wearing vaccine tracker NY Times website pretty amazing. information available, six approved vaccines (they're tracking US vaccines) efficacy data (5 different vaccines, lowest efficacy 84%). providing expected timelines still guess, tracker discuss expected timelines.  nurse obviously mean scientific method.

Society doesn’t either lmao. little something called Roe v Wade garuntees us right bodily autonomy eyes government. Nice try tho even aren’t empty lockdown really extreme one thing built hospitals COVID exactly.

really? hospitals large enough handle numbers pandemic level sickness? really doubt it. scream u scream everyone scream ice cream 

**Availability**

Bamlanivimab allocated state health departments US Department Health Human Services (HHS) based case counts severity outbreaks. state health departments responsible allocating antibody local health facilities. Finding facilities equipped administer IV infusion capable managing anaphylaxis exposing uninfected patients SARS-CoV-2 may difficult.

**Conclusion**

The investigational IV monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) FDA based association reduction emergency department visits hospitalizations recently diagnosed patients mild moderate COVID-19 considered high risk progressing severe disease and/or hospitalization. drug needs infused 1 hour facility equipped manage anaphylaxis. Bamlanivimab beneficial hospitalized patients. guy know said ""theyre releasing poison vaccine"" said ""didnt almost overdose heroin last month? youre calling vaccine poison?"" waiting on? see sentiment lot, seems people incomplete understanding data have, unaware they're waiting already data on. Doria rumored run President upcoming Presidential elections? words people sub talking covid, long term effects found article deeply troubling. thought meant supreme justice DeathSentence first. girlfriend radiation therapist (treating cancer patients radiation). team 8, one intending get vaccine becomes available hospital.

What fuck? Which, whatever, since going get soon can, still blows mind. AstraZeneca could approved UK coming weeks I’ve heard.

In US believe goal approval j &amp; j AstraZeneca vaccine around mid January early February. 100% sure tho nothing status wealth, charge creating vaccine makes sense would get one first doses vaccine. showing trust vaccine people take it. tolerate Tyranny!!! Oh, unless employer wants it.   Yep, 2yo wears one too. first like it, firm grown accept it. 

The worst thing licks it, means carry extra switch into. trust science too, however science yet prove vaccine effect anyone long term. sucks. would stirr coffee without classic m16? lean toward positive evidence. often assume worse true protect it. case, one would assume vaccination prevent transmission. hard. need substantial breakthrough treatments, hopefully, produce significant results. Canada's contract company stipulates can't held liable severe side effects. serious concern, knowing Pfizer totally hook decided fuck everybody pandemic get payday. healthy skepticism assume lots worldwide governments health agencies lying trials? Like think sounds reasonable: lots different governments want kill citizens vaccines, trials fraudulent? Elective procedures hospitals lifeline. Without government money many hospitals could handle another 3 months minimal revenue. EMA goes Brrrrrrr current covid-related death count verify assumption (yet).  works? Well great news confidently say world hunger since family ate lunch fact hungry! Great job everyone! great day humanity! 

Wait, whats that? Certain people 10 minutes (or maybe hours intense work, rehearsals, late nights paragon adequacy competence u/andrew2018022) mean larger threat medical services resourcing across US? Damn thought absence problem one sustained 5 minute period ceased exist? single dose. would cut time required almost 50%. Always put /s safe  family medical field well. works ICU FIL ER, that's asked stat. They're getting vaccine week dgaf. Lol! vaccine research looks good. figure could also long term risks COVID catch come time frame would surer long term affects vaccine, said fuck it. Seems schedule Pfizer, one week behind. Good shit. bad we're wild away third, least. people difficulty accessing contraception pandemic. I've heard horror stories people endometriosis use birth control manage condition can't access currently. also know people upper limit fertility window make tough choices well. :( Well, kind science. know mask supply limited, yiu hypothesize people horde, mathematically model scenarios masks recommended (and horded rate x) recommended (and horded rate x-y) impact spread healthcare workers, thus healthcare system.

Then run experiment (not recommend recommend), observe results, update hypothesis.

Sounds pretty scientific me! mean, I’m going take rushed vaccine either. five years we’ll find gives cancer something. thanks. knows rushed vaccine fail. Good PR Mr CEo, take vaccine pretend waiting like rest poor people  Research shown greatest transmission risk happens period day days symptoms appear. Asymptomatic people transmit much bulk infections seem caused small minority people, something like 80% 20% individuals.

 rate true asymptomatic individuals closer 25%, majority. risk seems come pre-symptomatic individuals. Exactly. Maybe cared GBS patients get vaccine, reason always known.

It's like emphasizing many people die car accidents wearing seat belt. zero!

""Seatbelts completely safe"" equivalent they're saying. used ICU nurse imagine bad must be. I’ve also worked ER Hospice. three I’ve watched lot people die. really bothers people act like COVID doesn’t matter fatalities elderly. people. loved family friends. Dying away families ICU death deserve. Best luck you. I’m sure you’re burned fuck. work clinic lot testing. volumes 300% last year. usually send 2 patients ER shift due COViD. We’ve lost 40% staff burn out. Quite left medicine altogether. I’m drinking significantly year ago. keep telling need hang little longer know back mind nothing going getting better anytime soon. everything conspiracy first thought. enough time put seeing negative side effects vaccine. knows loaded tiny bots Bill Gates use track us all! JK LOL. Well, Emperor Fauci keep panic alive somehow. Yours, too. Nice come across another fan.  course, *I trust scientific method*, quite roll tongue way. Take medical advice someone said medical training. fine Maybe it’s “covid vaccine”... would “sars-cov-2 vaccine”. vaccinate virus condition causes. Assuming BioNTech/Moderna approved next months (in west) way general public vaccinated July.

Then old persons working health sector go Japan watch Olympics. :-D Yeah, want take full mind-control pills whatever, could just... Lie said took it. that's obviously case. standard prodecure prevent exactly that.

- make sure works
- make sure harm
- make sure works harm widespread study
- let externals control results findings

Let's say one vaccine harmful ingredients may harm millions people long run. 
Why accept 2 others - dozens line come?
Once information made public one wants get vaccine - even safe ones. 

In end results ""piles bodies"" without hope end additional medical procedures worst possible outcome have. 

This hypothetically, cases that's process is. stupidest thing ever anyone public interest get vaccine *live*. Film it, heavens sake *don't get live*!

*Every* ~~vaccine~~*thing* small chance cause serious side effects, like life threatening allergic reactions. devil, I'd put dice people getting live. irrational outcry following kill 10.000s. No. Even without pandemic, answer no, imho.

Two sides coin - idiots critical thinking permanently turned  shit end happening significant rate (or probably even insignificant itll twisted) people lose trust vaccines anti vax movement would blow size would devastating society. 

Yep. even freakin' pandemic. Measles great example past problem comes back haunt us. fuckup covid vaccine open pandora's box area. 1676 sufficient sample size. actually criticize data would collected 8 day period. 

The major criticism interpretation data would usually people say going wait something, don’t count yes. responses tell 34% confident vaccine 66% country still willing take it. them, care. Virus mutating year. give amount concern S:A222V mutation spike protein emerged Spain summer.

If idea fuck mutation -- well, go.

And remember minks ""COVID-20""? get already made doses 62% vaccine, continue make it? produced labs make 62% can’t make 90% therefore doesn’t block production?  I'd rather donate people need help rich powerful, take care 97% COVID deaths people 60 up. 93M people age demographic.

We enough vaccine doses make risk overwhelming hospitals go window end lockdowns, even everyone get vaccinated.  Wow, that’s lot traveling one year. travel year holiday need year get actual travel part system. Wow major props you. dated since pandemic started, OLD mostly date outskirts social circle, since kicked us campus March.

Rooting work out! gotta hollywood passionate kiss airport terminal thing! Sorry leisure travel, glad starving. I'll go whatever OSHA says. say things okay, I'll go that. Sure thing bud. Governments everything lose 4 years desperate hold onto power, say anything keep power - get transparent lens truth, whole truth nothing truth. naive. Also could study done elderly patients would higher risk hospitalized. Makes sense since mask wearing became normal East Asia previous SARS outbreak.

Just admit talking yourself. Considering 2 3 vacc’s stage 3 ever make viral infections right track. loser. Knew someone bound eventually. Wonder auto correct? modern bro Moderna vaccine wish would presented msm. can't believe amount people still think came lab. Hard pass injecting anything made Russia without mountains independent testing evidence. know what...scratch that. Hard pass. that's good point yeah, logical leading scientist would take vaccine first, one influence creation? think would give trust someone happens ceo company Or... ever. mean, still post-9/11 security theater. keep wearing mask planes trains, flu something. 

I tons now, might well put use.  play words. Train 4 method use ICU assess paralyzed patient placed continuous paralytic IV drip. deliver tiny shock 4 times face wrist look twitch. 3 4 twitches, adequately paralyzed. 2 twitches good. 1 0 heavily paralyzed. make patients tolerate vent, common covid past year. Maybe meant causes fertility. lol No, said months. 2020 supposed year, finally turning 21 thought year gonna non stop fun. Lol. would take vaccine 4-7x likely leave vulnerable Covid another vaccine simultaneously produced? 

And factory point make sense? Unless less effective vaccine produced totally different factories cannot produce 90% vaccine, blocking production 90% favor 62%. coordinate student clinicals hospital work, spot on. see huge first-year classes, second-year big, even fewer finish pass boards. Granted, lot drop change minds (a lot decide go teaching seems) lot can't handle load. thats enough, no? think 100 million health care workers and/or risk groups US. I'd figure would enough appease desperately want vaccine, whenever happens available rest us choose whether get it. don’t care all, won’t judge you, won’t make fun you, etc. Don’t expect wear one covid flu/cold though. government said ok everyone! Texas also doesn’t income tax Dismantle may strong word. Softening - absolutely.

Thank helping us get this. Take care. Here's latest case/death charts California, running 7-day state pretty good (by US standards). They're currently 52.67 deaths per 100k. ranks 41st among US states per capita See, we'll get eventually... wife can't breastfeeding there's data vaccine safe that. lot? Considering country almost 90x population. won't. force people get vaccinations got school college different countries. I’ll gladly consume “chemicals” (what isn’t fucking chemical) means prevent spread proven deadly disease like would criminal. Handcuff put bus camp forcibly vaccinated rest us safe 55 million first number could find 2019. anyone better many cases Mississippi cause average patient state takes 2 beds? cousin three young boys, neighborhood organized outdoor Santa “interaction” (literally words used Facebook post, lol). Santa sat ways away boys, masks on, pictures, looked like read book something. 

My parent’s church also puts Santa breakfast every year kids get meet Santa make crafts. dad usually Santa, church gotten pretty slick streaming church services YouTube, trying convince could put Santa stream kids, think already passed torch another guy last year anyway. CDC said ok it.

No NOT. CDC said need test patients COVID returning homes *and* need able perform quarantine precautions. Several states DOJ investigating many people example, March 25, 2020, New York ordered: “No resident shall denied re-admission admission [a nursing home] solely based confirmed suspected diagnosis COVID-19. [Nursing homes] prohibited requiring hospitalized resident determined medically stable tested COVID-19 prior admission readmission.”

This violates CDC guidelines common sense.  Please stop spreading misinformation. Please stop spreading propaganda. sad state affairs several states follow CDC guidelines, thousands died result, shills media pretending like nothing wrong. STOP IT. Stop desecrating thousands died due incompetence. really get say Covid affects elderly say young healthy people get sick. whole thing scam sure. can't get straight answers want us know bad say is. wearing mask more. getting ridiculous. another way big pharmas make extra billion. People lockdown stop spread. Idk that’s controversial you? Also locking doesn’t change anything economy. Look Sweden. Went herd immunity approach still gdp dropped 8% June 2020. Comparably scandanian neighborhoods can’t recall exact number wasn’t far off. point even without lockdowns economies suffer question loss life people left conspiracy theorists.

74 fucking million fuckers stupid enough vote fascist again. okay ? Better get cough checked might covid. Vaccines utilize dead virus particles generally carry risks mRNA vaccine wouldn't. lots data points older vaccine models mean safer. FDA approved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). taken straight FDA's website: 

""Under section 564 Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act [(FD&amp;C FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products unapproved uses approved medical products used emergency diagnose, treat, prevent serious life-threatening diseases conditions caused CBRN threat agents adequate, approved, available alternatives.""

[Link words, things may necessarily rigorously tested approved certain emergencies.

I'm vaccine supporter, vaccinated, different situation. companies much benefit profit rushing product market without proper testing, bit skeptical. already know I'm going downvoted. But, provided someone counters adequate sources I'm keeping open mind willing shift stance. Come man. Vaccine safety like 99.999%. people complaining side effects probably lying watched many Kaarens YouTube videos insufferable.  Bellingham!!  Normally I’d say don’t care people want hurt taking vaccine especially since means people want could get sooner. 

However, right kids can’t get vaccine means people sending big FU kids. Trump rolled quarter billion public education campaign reduce vaccine hesitancy. Here's latest case/death charts Orange county 54.54 deaths per 100k population.  ranks 2,098 overall among US counties per capita seem know whole lot female reproductive system? read 'film circumstances hospital', read record feeling posterity info available years. Vaccines usually take 4 8 years check long term affections. one got finished year. Yes! That's good stuff. Enouraging results indeed! cheek EU suggest UK rushed approval process well (and I'm Brexiteer).

TheUK actually skip steps usually seen necessery aspprove vaccine. actually rush it. luckily know, estimated 360k, dont forget anything happen orojection bilateral salpingectomy (elective removal fallopian tubes) 2018, amount nurses I’ve since ask still period astounds straight concerns me. 😔 changed mind seeing bodies pile streets converting science. Even cynical take would tell governments corporations care lot, sick people don’t work don’t consume. They’d prefer us fat happy like. I'm Europe, trust authorities.

If American British, could say same, given farcically countries behaved crisis. must able travel future then. Apparently seen studies done effects vaccine years now? effects later people severe allergies myself? put lot trust government. History shown that’s always good thing... people take cause unusual side effects overall, people leery calm we'll 5-10% people seriously antivax rather ""are SURE legit vaccine Trump trying save job/a way POC guinea pigs white people/pharma trying make money?"" soft antivaxxers. might tautological comment I've ever seen subreddit. what's point? Blindy faith big pharma?  apologise enough brain cells realise vaccine proven safe less dangerous actual virus... you’re making judgement based something “feeling fast”? beg you, please use critical thinking skills. Answer questions see come conclusions:

How long average vaccine take conception fda approval?

In time frame, time consuming parts? 

How long vaccine development? (remember can’t start human trials, LOT steps this)

At particular steps vaccine speed at? 

Is statistically significant difference trial times previous trials compared one?

Theres ton questions would want answered begin spewing doubt confidently. political reasons vaccine March, yet didn’t materialize. Cynicism good, don’t confident based gut. hope right, love idea Drug-Lord disagreeing Fauci. tried people ever drown sea? fucking float land bro. billionaires need vaccines. clone cryostatis ready thaw download into. many people outside nursing homes require hospitalization sick. many stories ER nurses doctors say turning away patients would normally admit, telling manage illness home. hear stories people getting blood clots O2 levels dropping rapidly trying manage care home. can't assume death rates we've seen far would hold true cases explode people cannot receive care. young people may vent month, may require supplemental oxygen days. Oh look, guy thread. No, take away Facebook login. hope employers require Dude, got fired right rehired milliseconds fucking state right now. Here's latest case/death charts Mississippi, running 7-day dire. Overall state 141.10 deaths per 100k. ranks 8th overall US per capita Well need many vaccines Bill Gates said need measures least 2022. IMO viruses get worse might well start pumping money resources vaccines, mandating punishing anti vaxxers rapists killers it’s chance getting back kind normal. 6 feet arbitrary number use hope people follow. really mean anything. virus survive air room people, risk. # people room length time spent increase risk. Masks help too. done that? particular hospital many times? mean second one slightly opinion based really wrong said there? mRNA vaccine technology completely different traditional vaccine tech, sense whatsoever apply timeline reason one untrustworthy. Like, frozen food cooked microwave traditional oven. suspicious microwave takes 5 minutes takes oven 25 minutes do? It’s different tech, timelines don’t apply. simplistic example yes, paragraph recognize good information I’ve already pointed mRNA able microwave scenario. Although, fair, people think microwaves would give radiation poisoning first came out.

As never history much technology now, much money scientists pointed squarely one thing covid, I’m sure feel good information there. That’s 100% true.  point many resources something, things happen fast. East Van here. need time internet.

Go walk. know looks bad, *might* due change reporting, rather real spike: "" noted that..... changed data extraction process &amp; updated data extraction time 1 p.m. (from 10:30 a.m.), **resulting one-time increase case counts** variations results. "" We'll get 2000 daily new cases soon I'm pretty hopeful see drop tomorrow. need special islands people like We're noticing trend last year disruptive kids usually take teachers time energy away children actually want learn longer attending classes. best learning year child far. moment reopen, back square one. pulled market made manufacturer change formula like 9 years ago. always say removed two locos. current version still lot alcohol fuck super alert way. Meatloaf safe word don’t really think benefit waiting 3-4 months, already people got vaccine 4+ months ago trials. Short mid-term side effects like well known now. It’s long-term (years) side effects way knowing. condescending? don’t understand all. She’s first fluke. wants able show people example vaccine safe. Can’t tell top tier sarcasm not. FDA disagrees - article April talks UVC Far UVC. damage skin eyes.

UVA - aging waves
UVB - burning waves
UVC - cancer-causing waves also release ozone- work well air vents, direct exposure human tissue plastics cause appears prevent spread virus well

This **hugely encouraging**. ""Can vaccinated people still transmit virus?"" major open question significant implications quickly return normal happen. Yes, please! means anti-vax trouble vaccines before.

Besides, anything, whether vaccine piece machinery gets rushed design phase hurried production going quality assurance problems.

I'm going wait second wave myself. place grandfather great managed isolate proper care patients COVID. can, anyone can. Let try explain another way you. think anything anti science superstition.

If car manufacture normally takes multiple years develop produce vehicle suddenly they're told need make one less year. people aware new timeline, many wait purchase vehicle ensure issues. 

Unlike vehicle, body can't go buy another body. People pro vaxx cautious this. 

If believe could issues vaccine personally take available help show others major side effects issues. help adoption it. Exactly, like 100 doses? That's accounting error, stand behind product get vaccinated Salk, well developers, traditionally take vaccine they've developed first display confidence increase public trust. :-D presume post going filled people criticising Californian residents poor performance, like subreddit literally state?

Or California get excessive sympathy free pass, reason? optics, someone find reason complain, complain loudly.  Kids get spread rest family though. can't separate groups. Haha 😂they trying way hard point “Except Patrick Mahomes”  loading Mom? Well make tin foil hat people go crazy really matter. could say took it, proof would have? Well duh. happen again. Future proof. never said vaccine would impact lockdown. said situation countries need go strict lockdown biggest trading socialising season year demonstrates damn emergency warrants emergency approval.  apply vaccines developed? think French leading nation number Holidays 30-35 Holiday days year (in better jobs), usually European countries also 20-25 days.

Even paid country, bargain use sick days, modern countries go doctor certify sick need days off.

Occasional sickness part life human here. surely recommend lockdown executive branch. Löven members cabinet throughout pandemic emphasized listening experts FHM temporary pandemic law place late spring. reason didn’t recommend lockdown simple, didnt believe concept, didn’t think sustainable didn’t think vaccine way soon christmas. mean outrage fest? think stupid broke law put people danger. agree that.

So... raging about? think deserves consequences stupidity, you. dont work way ------- online decide gets rescued sea ------.

If coast guard spend time fuel rescuing idiots trying break quarantine jetskis, *costs money*. enough people it, coast guard requires bigger budget. budget comes *from taxes*. can't believe explain you.  guy hypocrite, ‘we don’t need wear masks COVID mania’

Then goes along say ‘but COVID please wear mask around me’ bodies piling streets

bit exaggeration, no? ""free"" socialized healthcare shit care depending state, good doctors even accept insurance. we're stuck crappy healthcare, yay? Better nothing? Sorry would rather live reality. Black people need depend government ""help"" that's another conservation another subreddit. predict half million, plus minus 100,000. say want it? wondered FIFTY percent don't. Besides availability, scarce course, also face huge logistical hurdles almost insurmountable now. true vaccine needs kept -90 degrees, ability receive small batch time. weeks ago, President Ecuador said could handle 30,000 time, two biggest cities. hope shelf-stable-at-reasonable-temperature version comes day, impossible reach population. don’t know someone downvoted you, need half-glass-full people here! Jeez guys. would love go presentation like get actual information questions answered. 

As now, want vaccine, speed everything, I’m unsure. I’m nurse (of three) clinic board getting don’t data. Lines what's going hospital. Nurses hesitant get vaccine saying theyll take many different reasons. reality going back normal enticing. course, we're going dealing wave misinformation surrounding side effects vaccine, hopefully doesnt negatively impact perception. Get tested. freedom!!!! /s Dang pace milli month. Whoa lot testing Ontario’s population is. reason testing much positivity rate climbing? see sarcasm tag? also know science didn’t always get right first time. won’t first get vaccine, also won’t last higher-ups decided best time bypass heavy regulation push experimental tech approved.

Is possible may qualified decide best way go vaccine? doesn’t, that’s specified. guess missed family medical field. reads actual research papers go department. get research? Long Island. Hey, makes feel better world. hold hope people suddenly start care anyone else.

That's way UK approaching jt Phase 1 trials test safety, right?

That's really care about, want thing give cancer 5 years whatever think workers nursing homes get vaccinated first nurses hospitals part risk group see reason. I’m antivaxxer means. anyone concerned long term effects. mean haven’t done much research vaccine, really news saying kids always realized mall Santas fake, we've told they're Santa's helpers (like elves) report back real big guy since Santa can't everywhere time. nursing home staff vaccinated, stop spread NUrsing Home residents. know risk vaccine outweights risk getting COVID?

Because clinical trials.  Constantly feeling hopeless surrounded death suffering 9 months takes toll people. see compassion something struggle less month ago 'flyover' states getting hammered CA much better popular sentiments expressed comment sections similar really stubborn, lazy, stupid. live rural, heartland adjacent area fuck given general public.

Fuck 'em. 51 can't even find comments rationing care ""red"" states, think mods started deleting got really creepy.

When bad things happen people view ""other side"" shit them, make statements entire states homogeneous, attribute moral failing, quite people seemed genuinely excited implied death toll. bad things happen people identify say ""meh yeah going happen eventually, even though people taking seriously others not, can't shut everything forever, really hard lock 9 months course people going slip up"". right would soon rule long-term side effects, waiting know means also giving benefit vaccine begin with. I'm going keep things keep generally fit healthy, hope that's enough.

Regarding short/mid-term effects already conducted research, mostly right. I'll add that, pro-scientific-method, I'm blind effect capitalism sometimes get reported science. There's big pot gold end covid rainbow, waiting first pharmaceutical companies vaccines come take it. nice graph (airport data only, total travelling): It’s testing infrastructure good catching much higher portion cases hot spots. data nerds give accurate representation CFR IFR scale Trump pushing away taking ask well ***Both took took placebo DIED.***

Go ahead try me, mate. double. Let us know goes nothing happy that.

You call are. Sorry, insert coin try again.  Ignorance bliss know risk vaccine outweights risk getting COVID? literally don’t know long-term risks COVID vaccines, haven’t around long enough tell. Here's latest case/death charts Arizona, running 7-day currently 100.97 deaths per 100k population. ranks 15th per capita fair, think it’s likely isn’t 100% altruistic doubt vaccine. vaccine approved later discovered dangerous many important people’s heads going chopping block think highly unlikely that’s case right now... Keep mind vaccine getting approved fast rate multiple nations organisations. it’s ruse, they’re fault. in, you’re speaking one history’s biggest cover up. Ever.

If cuts line, line cut others well. assumption people start making. logistics turn awful, you’re trying vaccinate whole world once, people die could saved vaccinated time. Questions asked, everyone start digging got access shouldn’t yet. Pfizer would play key role this, produced distributed vaccine. also ones “decide” gets it.
By publicly stating company get vaccine, turn, excludes narrative shows “we don’t decide gets vaccine, follow guidelines experts decided us.” altruistic. distrust. saving company possible lawsuits PR nightmares. Every health care worker helps several patients, ethically want patients helped. think that's logic, open thoughts. referring male fertility pregnancy. point people addressed concerns unknown effects covid seemingly “healthy” people shot downplayers people concerned rumors. [But baby! reasonable expect outbreak could controlled it

I mean can? pretty much way pandemic.  1, Austria, Australia, want disprove covid test, least know basic geography.
2, articles explaining happened, uses test wrong. Ok cool. Chill gal. I'm fine mentality kinda scary. Many/most people social distancing wearing mask regularly also getting along fine. Everyone fine aren't. Telling people consequences actions impact people ""bullying"". place propaganda echo chamber? Asking seriously. title “I trust science”... top comment thread bashing front line workers (who lauded past year) obviously questioning safety vaccine skipped safety testing... people idiots? Really? point question actually pushing comments votes, real front line workers comments questioning get downvoted too. age scientism people don’t even understand is.

Let die COVID. probably cost society less smoking Thanks. Take care yourself. Edit add: talked therapist today says college student patients gone back previous depressive behaviors. one alone issues dealing pandemic. No. really. pharmaceutical intervention reduce adverse effects patients get emergency approval. vaccine get emergency approval reasonable expect outbreak could controlled it. vaccine disease already spreading globally slow spread several month need emergency approval. individual person achieve high degree protection themself social distancing protective gear societal spread stopped short term. not?

Can imagine living Mainz, seeing BioNtech building across street, knowing miracle happened there, seeing flown across ocean... (whilst we're second lockdown)  true all.

I know flu shot important. count exactly six days COVID deaths since March 11. One March 12. EU responsible approving vaccine emergency use, regular approval. EU country approve vaccine emergency use want need “please use directed” disclaimer morons think coke cans human? death toll continues rise, willingness get vaccinated. know good data yet COVID, diseases transmit protected vaccination? know flu possible, since vaccine rarely perfect, can't think another example. know data available, I'm still planning wearing mask while, really tend believe folks vaccinated, going spread anything (or rare). Yes, lacking time. way telling whether vaccines cause long-term side effects (after years) not. Time can’t bought money. That's highly unlikely. overwhelming majority adverse health effects vaccines occur directly administration. Long term problems exceedingly remote degree worth worrying about. Got source that? hope so, 18s get though. teachers older high school students, absolutely. agree. think ""microchip"" nonsense silly-ass paranoid conspiracy theories result people failing/refraining self-examining thinking processes. Like Socrates said, unexamined life worth living. sort exaggeration every life precious; unexamined life bound become burden everyone else. Cue line conspiracy theorists yelling CEO ""refusing"" take vaccine.
I appreciate sentiment, think helpful takes order give anti science idiots go Yeah, right answer.

Those looking claim ""The CEO take vaccine"" actually care does, they'd shift goal posts bullshit fake. way look really number could mean additional people hospitals. 4 million traveling increase 0.2% hospitalizations (that conservatives number given know fast virus spreads) that's another 8,000 humans hospitals big increase. appreciate putting here. Eating disorders often invisible become severe.

My partner sat last week ask ok noticed thin gotten; even realized begun restrict again. Everything control right now.  really. know anyone cares season. us acting like real, true season. know different everyone objective source generally happens people Corona?

Yesterday smell weird today lost sense taste. feel perfect yet develop serious fever trouble breathing? 

Does fact loss taste happening fever mean serious symptoms? worst yet come? toss up?

I'm afraid would like answers. Well... friends Facebook friend. necessarily make people know all.

But see point. hung up:/ Please elaborate exactly skipped EUA? fact look raw trial data, that's MHRA's normal process (unlike FDA). would nice facts whatsoever saying 'they rush it'. Unless simply mean EUA, point really worth engaging on. wrong thinking vaccines provide sterilizing immunity? wouldn't/doesn't one?

Part studied question yet, right? likely reason vaccine would behave differently others? Funny things would nightmare, drink bottle, wasted, strangers, cheer worthless sports etc.

Weird miss things would Even would paid.

Dunno worse, like simple things like that, think simple interesting things.

Maybe different.

Only thing miss lonely person going gym, one rare things enjoy, too, like alone crowd.

Crowd events sucks, always alone un-noticed, easy miss author: Please help post subreddits posts; everyone else: please copy end paste post subreddits posts. I’m surrounded many virus unbelievers know still plenty still don’t believe it’s serious news don’t show human emotions this. roommate keeps refusing wear mask keeps going out. might asymptomatic keep infecting innocent people without knowing. can’t talk sense neighbors anymore. vaccine doesn’t prevent recipient getting corona it’s actually worse vaccine all. 

What much asymptomatic carriers running around spreading virus like plague. infection rates least ten times higher today.

Instead arresting people perpetuating disease police stand watching saying ""we arnt sure procede"" rules change daily impossible keep even try follow rules know do. started strong lacked conviction like you. definitive proof would cause issues, no. there’s also proof won’t pregnant women always excluded. Here’s NPR article key takeaways this:

-	They didn’t test vaccine pregnant women ethical concerns (standard practice)
-	The UK made wide announcement pregnant women take vaccine.
-	Members US organizations asked pregnant women included studies didn’t happen.
-	The US CDC FDA taken stance pregnant women opt they’re comfortable evidence provided either decision (opt people say health care workers “knew” getting shouldn’t surprised what’s going It’s common sense breakout atypical pneumonia would considered communicable competent doctor. Maybe communist Chinese ones, absolutely hospitals operating. work hospital that's already received vaccine entirely voluntary. kind liability forcing people take vaccine approved emergency use would insane. talking computer program. Good lord mRNA treatment different traditional vaccines, would anyone know anything long term effects? mRNA nature highly unstable even lab conditions, guarantee mass deployment vaccines degrade handling transport? think problem people just, really know put it, dumb. imagine extremely religious people particularly ""believe"" science, convincing take vaccine approved science really good way approach things. saying ""believe"" science, one step closer world, grasp thought believing something. wanted accurate - sure say that, goal make people understand make people act. need people understand order act. many said would consider later date. important bit. convinced eventually take may take months persuade still whereas others take matter what. way hit 75%.

Glad hear. curiosity, know roughly many people hospital vaccinated week? *s e* right; stuck ""inventions"". mentioned, science perpetual questioning. comes certain point time necessarily trustworthy.

So saying trust Science, trust process, makes sense. saying trust invention brought forth science naïve. unlike advanced nations earth U.S. employer care can't stand up, feverish point delirium barely move due achy joints muscles, expect work can't work due illness good chance job return to. flu shot prevents that. another poster said, prevents spreading others may robust immune system could kill them. I'd first line vaccine penis enlargement side effect. Sign guess want Bell's Palsy guys keep moving goalposts people let you. mean still generalize things like mofo double that. 18% Americans believe probably hyper focused areas extremely high numbers Protestants US seeing completely reject evolution across whole religion hardcore.

Womp indeed ya cunt gave special gift year! matter Quicker? testing period still Exactly this...we can't even get mask social distancing part down. media sort blame since blowing news. People going get false comfort act like beach hot sunny day act nothing wrong.

Trust me, way far many people still going contract covid 19 get vaccinated follow protocols. still chance. likelihood life pandemic over. make adjustments. long lasting effects. vaccine good, cure issues. taking vaccine wouldn’t put dent number vaccines have. It’s dumb think he’s cares. talking vaccine distribution / herd immunity, factoring many people need vaccine due already covid? 

For America must millions, correct? Tens millions? 

I know figures could like 10% population need vaccinated, least right away. wrong? It’s year forever. dramatic. soooo important.

I’ve seen lot criticism example US CDC “backtracking” covid recommendations concerning masks, many people chosen best talking point justify wearing masks.

“First fauci said masks don’t work, said do, they’re forcing us wear masks... it’s really sketchy I’ll make mind.”

Nobody said blindly trust *one particular scientist*, know *the scientific method* produces objective facts *trust scientists using correctly*. Oh let dude harass across 10 different comments. Gj bot Kind really silly argument. ""Not building coal plants help reduce emissions"". sure even bother this... speed production, political/societal pressure release, emergency auth, months data, human nature thinking can't affect them(especially considering get weekly tests months now), I'm sure antivaxx/trump/something else blinds even considering it.

The point is, first bit news really made question confident pfizer product, alone. Plenty people fence ready sit first rounds least, every high-risk high-contact nurse like work wife get take much bigger hit society guy taking single dosage away single person. Coastal Southern California here, we’re sorry too. say liberal anti-vaxers area getting better. Unfortunately, it’s political spite suddenly found science. I’m sure last. Regarding thing experiencing side effects vaccine. Ofcourse we'll see stories people experienced side effects vaccine even health complications. likely reason two nurses UK severe allergic reaction. suffered history significant allergies carry around Epipen. someone end suffering significant side effect it'll probably vaccine first place whatever reason Yes, practical limits widespread implementation. seem likely we're going revamp every home's heating/air systems way, whatever solution care needs taken high intensity UV light health level. something want regularly exposed help it.

It would tempting consider sort stand alone plug-in unit, one wonder much power consumption would needed that, quickly could process purify air room, loud would be, much would cost unit.

That's lot questions figure there's even hope product making viable widespread approach. Yes. tragedy anyone would think thinking scientific. people need blind followers nearest scientist. kind sentiment implies never enough. want wrong wait cherrypick something backs claim, matter flimsy evidence is. You’re idiot, absolutely understand it. degree molecular biology biotechnology university Toronto, what’s bud? You’re Reddit warrior trust science. trust people every political reason make pandemic look ""over"" quickly possible. feels fast truly want everything up, I'm going first line wait continue wearing mask. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Let’s give new normal crew hope That's fair point. using term way public generally views healthcare workers, indeed truly pandemic goalies society. 

And soccer hockey player tell you, goalie keep game matter many acrobatics perform can't win teammates front them
don't put effort. people know knew would vaccine end tunnel. right, independent/university researchers dont cover data. research, publish results it.

But Pfizer massive company many concurrent operations, moment pushing past trials release vaccine early help take large chunk market share. R&amp;D engineering departments arent beholden public scrutiny way researchers are, first report managers first foremost they're employees company.

As I've said places, *probably* fine. CEO avoiding taking vaccine doesnt inspire confidence safety. Fortunately I'm medical field, like decide now. many do, may choose actions Except people doubt vaccine feel taken longer likely car salesmen stay home moms knew anything medical scientific process would know corners cut 

It’s anti vaxx anti science bs What? actively avoiding data? Good him. He’s obviously helped world great deal, working vaccine one thing. 

Is even legal take it? Doesn’t government decide? access doesn’t mean use it. ""I trust science"" type response ""I trust God"" something like that. trust science means ""I believe methods science followed evidence shows safe"". almost hear wheezing coming people lol 

REEEEEEE kalifernia gets pass !!!

They need break Yea trend already moving thanksgiving. hasn’t acceleration trend since.  could argue countries extremely low infection rate better waiting short period see well vaccine works. Vietnam basically cases well. People America (where live) definitely get immediately, unless condition could cause adverse reaction. doctors also said cigarettes healthy back 1930-1950... Skepticism always good. really danger running ventilators? Locally, still plenty (almost half total) despite worse shape LA terms ICU capacity (essentially, none).
 
I think there's real push avoid ventilation costs there's limited supply helps less initially thought (since discovered problem clots lungs moreso fluid), causes lot long term damage, much invasive/less-effective ECMO. 

I bet plenty hospitals would gladly trade three four ventilators 1 ECMO machine, know sure since types decisions happen way head.  LOT sheriffs Central Valley thing, refusing enforce covid measures. assholes. Ah yes, using big words makes argument invalid... saying insulted person thing.

Ignorance insult. ignorant infinite number things... you.

Cherry picked, called rant, insulted use words, misdirected ... concluded **I illogical**.

Whatever makes happy... mean outbreak controlled emergency approval. like ebola vaccinating medical staff point outbreak better keep local, would case emergency approval. Interfering normal approval start process take next year two weeks early populism. people get vaccinated could also isolate distance would similarly protected two weeks. time, L.A. positivity rate shot way up. We're 14% daily think 7 day average 12%. really good. least L.A. really comprehensive data available.

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/data/index.htm

Cases dropped significantly yesterday I'm afraid weekend lag today going really bad again. :(  Worldometer places tracking infections start tracking completed vaccinations country. would interesting watch threshold cases begin start leveling decreasing vaccinations start increase. Believe me, lot places can't manage it. I've worked least 12, 3 nursing school. ICU beds 80% capacity couple weeks region, local news stopped reporting it. assume it’s they’d saying exact thing every day, can’t get photographer news crew hospitals actually get across what’s going on. reason really know check COVID stats state every days. 

People don’t care anymore, they’ve got heads crisis over. Well that's case thing new put bodies whether medication, food, breathe in. 

That's learn read actually went making vaccine educate ourselves. prefer wait see, perfectly justified, move somewhere active cases spread.  paragraph deemed “good” gave recommended general research behind technology allows (or example anyone hesitant) opportunity form opinion science. 

The second one opinion without proper backing gave “not much”. 

This response contains another analogy isn’t backed science opinion. Outside mentioning tech/money/scientist. agree, don’t know matters case scientist divided separate camps. It’s like scientist collaborating here. I'm going answer examples want pass around wrong information, consider vaccinations work come surprise disease could still transmitted.

Here's take! Vaccination stop body infected, instead means body seen pathogen mount response illness occurs. theory, time infection body eliminating pathogen, would possible continue pass along said organism (as long dead/inactive).

Now, significant source propagation could be, idea.

I'm microbiologist immunologist, can't think reason wrote true. reason wouldn't/couldn't (since know) case, means - I'm trying spread crazy misinfo. They’re essential. get rest general public. Assuming long term effects COVID worse long term effects vaccine make potential long term effects vaccine disappear. 

Like said, take vaccine, know calling lack information long term effects bad thing. scrutinize things, concerning people saying possible long term effects relatively important, based information all.  mixing, vaccine may stored refrigerator 2⁰C 8⁰C (36⁰F 46⁰F) 120 hours (5 days). 120 hours (5 days), remove remaining vials refrigerator discard following manufacturer’s jurisdiction’s guidance proper disposal.” Maybe happened yesterday morning. Relative covid news cycle really current anymore. get alot coverage Canadian National news networks (i.e. CTV, CBC, Global). also know potential risks come vaccine that's developed short time... Reward = getting Covid all/not getting severe case 

Risk = ???(because they’ve tested like literally vaccines candidates) Taking conservative optimistic timelines account, think we'll really start see big gains made respect ""the numbers"" return normalcy March-May time frame. think things feel significantly totally normal June-August time frame near total normalcy (no gathering restrictions, throwing masks trash all, etc.) come September-November time frame. Add another 6 months timeline developing nations. no, everything conspiracy. That's get ya. don't. faith achievements, faith process. put neck gator breath piece glass. put regular mask breath glass. gator fog glass mask Members congress federal government absolute last list. em put skin game requiring tier-3 (healthy low risk) completed get theirs.  like people afraid hastily done science, common days.

Just 40% said take mean science deniers even saying vaccines work. almost always safer bet let groups people take brunt risk you. hundreds thousands people take long term risks properly evaluated, might pretty cool.

But mrna vaccines ""new"" (they're 20 year old tech, never really massed produced like this), there's already annoying complications. example, people showing HIV positive certain tests. HIV vaccine worked, antibodies responded we're close enough HIV proteins people produce antibodies HIV without actually disease all. mean, terrible, certainly huge annoyance complicate life future complicate testing. Imagine caught went millions people millions people false positive HIV? That's real world harm.

To pretend risk associated simply religious, scientific. twist it. Blind faith honest God skepticism different things believe 40% nurses science deniers. unlikely vaccine actually causes this. population size 4 cases Bell’s palsy normal rate. Theres 20-30 cases Bell’s palsy per 100,000 people UK yearly. 

One cases vaccine group also shows vaccine may cause it.

I’m sure precautionary. Lol, fauci literally said late spring/early summer comment makes think needs take break internet? think questions people asking. subbreddit incapable hearing opinions? 

“Hey dont like said, get here” „No pharmaceutical company would release vaccine wasn‘t safe. Anyone thinks otherwise conspiracy theorist.“ Oh yeah, pharmaceutical company would _ever_ release medication isn’t safe profits - let’s forget numerous pharmaceutical scandals came light last decades, like Contergan, Phen-Fen (now Pfizer btw), Avandia, Heparin name few. anti vaccine Covid denier means, let‘s lecture health care professionals whether want vaccinated asap first batch say everyone even faintest hint doubt crazy conspiracy nut. right here. Antivax idiots care proof. arguing good faith, engaging mistake. going find many people claim strong seasonality covid data have. there's reason geographical regions experiencing rise subsequent peak fall, regardless interventions.

here's thread twitter discussing CDC baseline absolutely excess deaths year. considering collateral damage deaths equation ignorant. wonder way test person likely Bells Palsy beforehand? way screen people risk. maybe realize right now? like subreddit literally any....  
  



this sub filled people varying opinions over, yet lump together criticize them. like states mention. guess human nature sort group things together make processing easier. US isn’t reaching herd immunity end Q2. That’s incredibly inconsistent experts like Fauci saying. It’s going summer fall. still understand masks nose. find mask nose lot less comfortable wearing mask correctly. irritates nose pushed bottom it. OZZY PATIENT 0 at-home test apparently it’s “off topic” point America doesn’t really lockdowns except barest sense Republicans actively holding needed support hostage? 

And thus it’s “lockdown” fatigue, “holy shit lot people dying government failing us fatigue”?

Let’s see on-topic, pretending “politics” impact America’s terrible outbreak?   don’t know placebo is.

Stop spreading conspiracy shit. It’s disgusting, quite frankly it’s obvious want feel smarter others effort.

You’re waste space, world would better without you. much money make transaction? much position company actually let go of? much think he'll receive part yearly bonus year?  ICUs already triage people according level need, system it. assume they'll continue greater consequences lower need list. UV LEDs EXPENSIVE. cheaper atm get UV bulbs halogen lamps get leds. didnt come actually wanting information, looking chance talk people? that's fine too. fucking problem life. information need quick google search away, better learning reddit anyway. talking about? Maybe live nationally covid cases 28 percent higher two weeks ago. includes first 14 days can’t afford lose another entire year lives COVID. vaccines join Modern Pfizer pretty soon hesitancy level vaccine decreasing every new survey. little faith baby know you, CEO company planning release greatest achievement date might lock sale stock well. *The entire U.S. population could vaccinated against* *by June, could enough doses immunize rest nearly 8 billion people world early mid-2022, current administration’s vaccine chief said Tuesday.*

So, everyone gets last dose end-of-June, would suggest relative normalcy 1 Aug. True comes something we'll studied utmost confidence. think normal March really optimistic. May could see Imo healthy question drug developed, tested, approved year. Polio vaccines decades testing improvement, annual flu vaccines mostly year year.

I'll certainly take available, assuming flaws noticed then. good keep open mind things. Well, maybe driving Jet Ski brand watercraft That's fair, still think strongest way stand behind product.

It's win situation rly. really not, though. logic also fuck people drive cars, exhaust fumes harm people; fuck people food plastic wrappers, because, ehh, birds get trapped shit like that; fuck obese people, raise healthcare costs too. Right? show son shows bunch footage tries get believe. tried science completely fucked it. argument one person gave valid reason he'll wait vaccine? Muppet. 0, start deciding gets priority? It’s long quarantine many. Positivity return, take time. 2020 fucking hard year. affect us genetically reproduce covid?

Birth defects etc? fucking modest panties got wet.. guy  would thoroughly unsurprised development well. still denying. anything say people anymore. danger cases close 0?

Again, need keep borders closed years. 

Hardly big sacrifice save lives.  artificially lower numbers make appear bad. trying argue right standard timeline creating testing vaccine? 

No, faster money people working it. I’m specialist field I’m one judge. 

Then claiming testing somehow adequate? phase clinical trials think adequate anyway? Given extraordinarily rushed timeline think it’s fair allow various people experts authorities slack coming slightly different conclusions timeline safest citizens, don’t agree

The experts authorities approving vaccine far, one another. trials coming similar vaccines finding similar results. 

Whose different conclusions talking about? Excellent point. thinking side, brain sometimes repress pain trauma people always able remember feelings 5 10 years; definitely clarity moment. vaccine, mean. Yes, it’s negligent treated within legal system. understand point, think point correct, however, point I’m making is: force it. could allowed process play normally Polio vaccine causing paralysis due first vaccine live attenuated virus. side effect manifests rapidly.


By mechanism propose side effects mRNA vaccines would manifest year later?

And again, I'll reiterate - mRNA vaccines clinical trials years already applications. There's issues seen there. Clinical testing patients long term. fact, even approval companies monitor patients long term. agree disagree it’s beyond scope sub don’t allow discussions that. angry person can't understand people. basically: delay getting NZ Australia Taiwan. Otherwise, likely get virus would worse, get vaccine Yeah, I'm thinking places want mandate vaccine emergency use status. forget said they'd put full approval, sometime next year I'm sure.  virus much worse vaccine. Every person vaccinated helps. Especially work health care. could get now, would. Happy cake-day! Animal bites really seen immediately. brush teeth knows what's last thing they've chewed on. Hope ok now. Small infections get deadly.


Our grandaunt passed March stroke. Missed two specialist appointments hypertension COVID. well that. Mentally sharp still working children's books editor, physically mobile independent. people missed treatments, delayed treatment diagnosis, similar situations her, possibly losing years life life quality.


People can't bare minimum wear mask care others. mask. impede freedom. like people getting locked apartments ankle bracelets/phone tracking app government workers food drops, random check ups, thousand dollar personal fines walking hallway like east asian countries doing. US standards 
 
-The Netherlands, 6682 new cases today 17.2 million people, full lockdown since today, essential shops (food drugstores) open, schools, gyms, daycare, restaurants, bars closed, working home strongly advised. 

-California, 42000 new cases today 39.5 million people, real lockdown. 
 
And lot people still think locked quite late Netherlands. 
Also, competition course, gives two widely different perspectives. pretty much can. 

Your toddler still seeing interacting toddlers interact families. 

I'm saying wrong enroll kid school all. point can't pretend like flu. Italy overtook Britain country worst death toll Europe. Multiple European countries top death per capita charts. Cases surging across Europe despite second wave authorities months prepare for.

But keep enjoying utopia :) Fair enough, soon enough I'm afraid. mistaken, viral vector vaccine like Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Yet, far effective. wonder is? Would disagree anti-vaxx movement tied right caused people left become less critical pharmaceutical industry ""own conservatives""? I’ve saying weeks:

By July 1st US:

1. Restaurants, bars, movie theaters back 100% capacity across country.

2. Parties in-person gatherings allowed.

3. restrictions in-country travel. International travel somewhat restricted however, travel developing countries sufficiently vaccinated population discouraged prohibited.

4. Large events (such sports games, concerts, festivals) allowed, significantly reduced capacity (possibly 25%). need show proof vaccination attend them.

5. It’s somewhat common see mask use public, masking requirements largely dropped. main exception public transportation (such subways), masks still required. “nuance” doesn’t matter, 99.9% people read headline, 99.9% comments people read headline. Would get plane 1/100 chance crashing?  think term changed messaging public. I’ve tempted write President Elect Biden press office start using it. might help change perception. Oh god. high time demand basic skills letting someone run office. never said anything doctors, never mentioned them

One got caught filter, another directly addressed. made sure got unstuck you, bud. also mentioned multiple times, literally quoted bringing doctors mocked it.  trust doctors infinitely trust Oh, clutching pearls!! distressing!! lol fucking muppet

I never mentioned them, yet replied comment doctors insulting? I'm liar? replying unrelated threads lies seems pretty sad, muppet.

More like wanted see saying elsewhere exactly expected. so? shouldn’t medical professionals working around tons illnesses diseases, especially Covid-19, told “Get vaccine you’re fired” told “If want work hospital, need get X vaccines” great child, wonder doing. people supposed stay hospital?? zero clue hospital systems even work America? need increase infection rate least 25% want compete Texas. They’re next level. Exponential growth means every day shatters last day's ""record"". would think news outlets realize now. actual title article ""Coca Cola Tests COVID-19 Positive Austrian Parliament""

Austria Australia. 

Austria landlocked country next Germany who's famous citizens include Johan Strauss, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Falco, Arnold Schwarzenegger. fucked badly. alright start supermarkets ran foods could eat went completely fuckin rails. 

Supermarkets fine damage done can't afford therapy lol. gonna kill me. Two weeks ago someone know get it. It’s bizarre long took bubble close think everyone besides ourselves, really see us nightmare together.

Can't shelfish wanting lockdown healthy people feel safe. Fuck you’re right. real public concern isn’t conspiracy theory.

We’re concerned development vaccine rushed billions dollars gain first market. Hence, personal risk short long-term complications vaccine may outweigh risks virus healthy individuals 50.

I’ve worked heavily regulated industries, including biotech. nature regulation speed product pushed relies heavily relationships regulators actual safety product. there’s revolving door FDA pharma/biotech.

It’s CEO’s job understand address concerns interest maximizing sales; that’s gets paid millions dollars year lead multi-billion dollar corporation.

If he’s choosing take vaccine, goodness heart frank ignorance public perception. Either would gross incompetence. trust Big Pharma US government exempts tort liability? Also still known true? Saturated fats lead bad cholesterol... **This AMA begin 12pm EST. Please refrain answering questions guest.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* They're less vaccine. Pfizer test asymptomatic transmission, also able verify vaccine degrade quickly outside ultra-cold storage. said, prove it, one willing take chances hard data support it. Come California Knowing statistics, Santa gonna far worse kids ..who probably even blink virus Ah, it’s kid move vaccine New York Louisiana little fishy. give vaccine Louisiana New York cases. smell conspiracy. bad ones quoting percentages. Want specific? 300,000 people needlessly **dead**, ripped families, US alone. pandemic means chance argue nitpick, shut mouth. Yeah, longer goes on, willing people “chance” vaccine return normal. Plus, people get vaccinated see there’s side effects, everyone fence open rolling sleeve up. recall discussed TWIV, anything 50% reduction would point sterilizing immunity. 

Additionally, Pfizer data knew protection roughly \~7 days out, take bit time lymphocyte uptake mRNA build immune response. we'd expect immediate sterilizing immunity, believe (imho) points thing roughly 7-10 days initial shot. long-haulers weakened fog, cain't perticerpate revellooshin. pretty much can. kept toddler preschool fall now, learning low-risk is, needing teach crucial socialization skills, we're enrolling spring.

The one change setup: daughter longer see grandparents indoors.  bubble. wife work work entirely home. never eat go stores. Yes, means deaths nothing vaccine. anything, shows vaccine makes less likely die.

You’re really, really dumb. Fair points, think crux argument OP making Gates resources (and employed them) buy many 'Bill Nye's"" keep informed. Nye theorizing something he's foremost expert in, Gates foremost experts speeddial. 

One may even argue, he's likely informed individuals far intelligent Nye. agree that. trust people either trust collective scientific community. would say accurately huge amount people labeled agreeing solutions scientific problems. Climate change biggest example. labeled climate denier liking something like Green New Deal

That’s point. I'm happy guys😭😭😭. get amen? Yes ty Seasonality wouldn’t explain massive death infection tolls sunbelt summer.

Other respiratory illnesses hit hard areas summer.

We evidence interventions working counties apart, rise fall all. maybe talk doctor, in-home testing kits maybe send you. doubtful, least someone That's good hear. Yea, unreasonable least little skeptical cutting edge mRNA vaccine came record time, CEO Pfizer want 'cut line' for. People sub overzealous. call glowing recommendation. done emergency use situation. one nursing homes would getting otherwise. Anyone nursing home old enough immunocompromised due age alone. Santa stay away year daddy laid Well mean , time official way sure safe efficient promised. gets weeks earlier later approved doesn`t effect much vaccine early rate immunity midterm really effected. 
And mess early EU closing boarder without speaking countries betting outer comes FFP2 mask ventilator really important together. guy started whole anti-vax movement doctor? eventually stripped credentials believe. Yes, you’re comparing two need actual basis “I’m sceptical scepticism good.”

We strong evidence vaccine creating high levels immunity without serious side effects. anything bring anyone’s concern it? Yes, like treatment, likely side-effects people. We'll know soon. However tests promising, anything within fraction damage virus causing would detected. many total beds guys have? dumb take.

Pharma execs trying strengthen anti-vax movement, lol. convinced me. longer getting vaccine myself, immunocompromised grandmother. want us turn lizard people. take chances COVID. Seems fair... giggling whole way, cold conditions body loses ability respond brain. answered that. point?

No, didn't. approved human mrna vaccine, made trials. Trials even know details comment chains, example idea immune response second dose known brutal. 

I also find funny compare taking recreational drugs youth, ones worst analogs already established simple molecules, taking vaccine well. funny one. Given states believe they'll vaccinating general public large April earliest... 12 weeks absurdly extremely optimistic get 2 shots many people.

And that's assuming enough people willingly line up. reason trust science regulations becoming stricter (especially EU) scientific statistical methods becoming better defined? Im fucking proud german days. act like Gentleman Good thing everyone spent last 9 months conditioning fear large crowds Give A! like doctors saying 1930-1950 cigarettes healthy. like swine flu vaccines europe lot children got narcolepsy vaccine. need go on? Skepticism always good, especially science observed frequency reported Bell’s palsy vaccine group consistent expected background rate general population, clear basis upon conclude causal relationship time, FDA recommend surveillance cases Bell’s palsy deployment vaccine larger mean? Nursing homes allowing patients come back HOUSE. go? throw street? OSHA right Yeah, that's look Health Canada British equivalent. Yeah nobody office got sick though wearing masks. Umm... placebo saline solution.

""Six people die Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials, two given vaccine. four given safe placebo solution salt water.""

***EAT IT.*** taken less time yes, hammered insane amount man hours 'Septics' accepted too. never said anything doctors, never mentioned them. lies seem pretty desperate. replying unrelated threads lies seems pretty sad, muppet. great username. JD?  Side effects UV led are... sunburn, skin cancer...

If that, inefficient viruses. model it, though reason it’s default view :/ It’s “rapid roll-out high-risk groups” model. Really? TIL 

Does mean we've basically probably caught asymptomatic measles point? article top page. research ask specific question (if indeed anti-vaxxer). Vaccine started used morning? Vaccine dammit! meant say that. competition.

Just worst, mean bad enough justify taking measures. Everyone waiting till they're worst take action results worst America. absolute nadir patriotism defense ""yeah, well... guy there?""

The goes waiting crisis hospitals. There's old saying ounce prevention. people seem think soon vaccine manufactured magically makes way patient's body?

Vaccinating everybody going take *long* time, sooner started better. plenty doses administer sign going run production continues fly excuse either. They'll gone social venues mid-spring. Mask mandates gone summer. public transportation, nursing homes, medical centers might keep around 2022 later. We've created situation requiring masks literally murder, hard backpedal unless solid data comes showing masks effective thought. exact thing places like south dakota doing, yay decreased cases! echo-chamber. like way.

Says r/DonaldTrump poster. Oh irony. made lol Yeah, vaccinate 70 HCWs early spring deaths hospitalizations plummet. start pull back (start hanging groups, casual shopping etc) without morally questionable. 

Moving new city June hoping least patio seating downtown bar without insanely conflicted will, diminishes ammo *those* fools convince others.  Late last night occurred need something like NPR's StoryCorps record emotional experiences people living COVID. explain without scientific article, would ponder throw don’t degree? you’re interested reading reasoning share. see people could issue with: “...I find hard believe Pfizer Moderna would stake brand image” reason believe didn’t make mistake? let's start vaccinating younger generations first. 

First accuse west hoarding they're saying stop use doses people relatively safe virus. exactly solution? elected market. Companies good management trend companies poor management trend long competition. It’s forgot seniors living own—they’re part initial roll-out. Environments like nursing homes (and prisons, dorms, etc) lot people close together interacting multiple staff high risk, addition risk presented residents’ age. would surprised elderly people included one next rounds vaccination, can’t find official info state’s plan, it’s it’s available yet. know it’s stressful, best course follow local news closely patiently, maybe grandma let doctor know she’s interested available. Mmmmm🥸 can’t rational people think *it makes fucking sense*. CEO company produced COVID-19 vaccine “lives world isn’t reason doubt vaccine”? could possibly case? literally **just led company vaccine trial, he’s absolutely seen failed versions**.

Seriously, dumber comment yours. Rational? Lmfao. would know basic reasoning skills calling dipshit Reddit.  Thats common stigma right there. 

If someone immunecompromised(that many % wise? guess would less 5% population) , risk cronical conditions, isolate selfs take precautions. forced inject i
Something body will, few, affraid selfisolate. Caveat, Christians believe that.

Very reductionist view spirituality /r/atheist you.

What's view Dustin, YouTube channel Smarter Everyday? He's highly engaging amateur engineer makes videos many different scientific topics, usually multiple perspectives domains better describe process. views science extension God. God.

Also daft *The Pope* literally embraces science (more often previous popes), highest level authority Christian Catholic God (same God way) argues favour science...

Where hell get notion monotheistic spiritualists implicitly anti-science? frankly see anywhere near bad see poor, uneducated Republican states. see coincidence religious... **wide spread systematic failure Governance** blame anti-science rhetoric. Lol...oh guy Reading back seem like saying nurses ghosts sorry misrepresent lol don’t think that’s necessarily case. Especially state big Texas. Panhandle People’s Republic Austin instance cross street without looking, made choice. imposed upon me.

Imposing risk death others choice.

""Wait see"" problem. wait see, combined people venture society anyway despite vaccinated. people refuse vaccination based arguments like spread disease others, either vulnerable vaccinated. destroys herd immunity. harm causes significant, damaging, personal.

There needless taking vaccine, either. Every additional vaccinated person builds towards herd immunity enables act society without risking others so. case *every vaccine ever distributed*. specific medical risk, yeah, take it, herd immunity defense. get herd immunity vaccinating rest. difficult science, man.

Don't put anger borne stupidity me. impose neither rest Reddit. like ""people like me"" might want look mirror find problem. prediction person used run best Covid modeling site: interesting go back start collect every thing member said period.  shouldnt massive infection rate shift soon deaths plummet probably wear one don’t you? People posting non-sense Facebook need legally sued talking bullshit. Especially maskholes. start suing y’all show hosts spread lies. Make special laws charging employers too. thousands people die Colorado hospitals lack ventilators?

I find articles concerned potential shortage back March April, can't find anything actual ventilator shortage. people scream reinfections reinfection rates proven (you know, science) lower things like flu

I coivd. sucked. sister also got pediatrician told avoid reinfection, despite antibodies. ridiculous. Covid survivors immunity need back line maximize lives saved bit aggressive almost fair response. asking us/anybody wanting get pregnant already pregnant risk ability kids. also asking group people ignore current UK US recommendations lack available data. we're vaccine, personally wish receive something wants time.

Adoption first choice option would likely go route we've already discussed that. sure generally they're anti Vax concerns vaccine getting rushed tested much usually are? They’re still recommending vaccination already Covid they’re 100% certain long immunity infections lasts. Il take mine ever political doctor gets also kick fast. typically takes around 3-7 days antibody production ramp up, coinciding development disease symptoms. guy CEO common sense he's taking shit vaccine. People want assume every variant one make vaccine pointless want vaccine. (Why not? IDK) nurse LA: ICU nurse LA metro here. environment work unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. know hell coming. Beds one thing — ventilators used medicines run RTs RNs MDs stretched breaking point? us aren’t afraid. It’s fear. It’s forced live reality never required experience.

I won’t ever able use FaceTime over. I’ve hear many families say goodbye afar. I’ve hide tears prepare wives husbands lose spouses they’ve married 40,50 years. I’ve heard people’s school-aged children begging live, screaming grief realization never see parent again. end isn’t death scars you. It’s consequences echo society long time.  Dead Granma! she’s dead killed her! Ex tethera. two things lost mail recently. im ordering Amazon much anymore. quality going tubes. government shit people voted shit means people probably shit too.  Can't believe people listened bet experts. Fuck.  Christian little it. It‘s fundamentalist religious followers community nutjobs. 

Holy fuck glad Little none BS country. hell posted? guys really create US covid sub post shit like that. zero relevance here. points making?

This, knowledge, first mRNA vaccine. mRNA vaccines effect coded protein production body. Protein production, disrupted, changed, limited exaggerated, cause kinds detrimental effects long term.

You know nearly enough process claim someone else ""defensive ignorance"".

That said, skepticism real merit. extremely short time development release trials enduring short months cannot show long term effects.

What say someone says ""what long term effects?"" clever ""I believe science"" counter?

The science, vaccines, involves ***long term*** studies. absolutely rushed. efficacy unquestioned, potential issues still unknown.

I still getting it, afraid, saying, someone skeptical hesitant automatically ignorant moron, someone takes without hesitation all, certainly is. I’m willing bet someone willing make ridiculous bet doesn’t salary mostly proof concept. Pandemic countries summer 2021 type message trying relay here?

""We like fascists states. burn constitution destroy liberty. Remember 2A thing, sheeple!"" Exactly. ""What's wrong? afraid use yourself?"" Given number downvotes removed comments, I’d work approach. It’s incredibly condescending Scientific estimations outbreak began based assumptions infectiousness happening January without knowledge seasonality. think outbreak earlier publicly acknowledged. recent leaked documents point many infections early December. canada essentially mandates vaccines provinces barring kids attending public school don't. suspect become 'essentially' mandatory canada eventually, want engage society “anyvay, zat’s lost medical license” 

“should awake dis?”

“ach, don’t vorry, ribs grow back!”

*no zey don’t* Misleading. interviewed yesterday morning perfectly willing take felt allow someone need first. company advised would better took show it’s safe completely agreed.  Like said post 2021. think Fauchi said need 75% population vaccinated. would probably take us til June 2022 everything went perfectly see many people taking safety concerns.  Far easier small island cohesion, states/counties etc.

If decent leadership cohesion government emergency services, like NZ Australia countries would get back normal.

Just stopping external travel impacting thing pubs/bars/restaurants. They've never busier due everyone island rarely leaving. Town always packed nearly every night, like TT week little quieter.

Tourism really industry that's still suffering, borders opened, we'd back closing everything again. Gov bolster extent, everything else well. American, tired that. people straight make shit here

why neck gaiters worse homemade cloth mask? isnt logic behind clothe closes neck versus chin causing spread CEO Pfizer didn’t take it. That’s need know.  use sacrifice make world better place, doesn’t mean continue trend sacrificing everything another baby. none all? offense, im risking Covid burger fries unless go drive thru, even really...because deal packages.... want tater tots :-( post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Okay? people are. don’t need billions people dude.

What happens lives matters far many children have. used get downvoted saying we'd seeing normal Q2 2021 vaccine give us hope

It very, odd wearing mask winter 2021 latest social distancing assumption vaccinated much? Good grief. unless worked big corporations continued employed PPP. ""water wet"" studies really needed. several reasons:

Some people earn livings studies people think needed.  call ""university professors"".

Some people believe act good advice, unless scientific study university professor giving advice.

And, people pay things limited resources, often want trustworthy advice actually work, spend money.  Straight no, compassion anyone working White House. take care big businesses expect people care can't even take care American people! take away simply turning 97% deaths mild cases solve burden hospitals.

Literally nobody saying that. Nobody talking death rates except you. Nobody talking length death vs recovery hospital.

Over half covid hospitalizations people 65+ according CDC. make seniors cant get virus, *half beds open everybody else*. don’t need people dude. country population 330 million now. 132 million WW2. cannot believe we’re 10 months still people cannot fathom difficult wearing mask people. 

I get it, doesn’t affect way, therefore anybody can’t tolerate mask must making up. blame Macy Thanksgiving Parade...That simply creepy. shut mouth airtight naturally, nose too?

just wear mask nose couple hours home fun, report back often realized actually exhale air whatsoever mouth still breathe? masks worn nose 0.0000. also dont hold breast place wear bra navel, dont keep feet warm wearing socks knotted around knees. insane old man. pregnant would take vaccine.  arguing spirituality. Ideas take person far. Like text book sex, unless jerk off, interesting. sense same? vulnerable ~20% pop vaccinated quickly, along healthcare workers.

For rest us, COVID much different cold flu terms impact. I've known 9 people that've COVID, small ordeal unless high-risk group unique situation.  Health Service run DUP Sinn Fein.. thats true. New York return favor - anyway. body comes contact foreign mRNA constantly. particular strand RNA worry you? 2 3? 4th case? Dude, started stripping place January... Depending live. live country bunch anti Vaxxers longer. nothing particular person.

Rather media others commenting vaccination rates AA communities might lower ""distrust"" ""Tuskegee"". basically evidence surveys study I've seen. seems media putting stories pictures appeal AA community. condescending ""Look! Someone looks like getting shot. See?"" use science public health convince people instead talking African Americans? Covid-19 rearview Feb get hard understand. wore masks 1 year without social distancing told would completely eradicate COVID, would it? Basically, that's done let jump bodies jump mutating every many leaps. way would funny COVID comes back way makes resistant antibodies. It'd massive slap face short sighted highly unlikely scenario. fed also part fiscal policy. profit, income.

No income, house, food, car, clothes.

100% chance die exposure/starvation 99.9997-99.5% chance survive virus (depending age)

I'll roll dice virus every time. 

There thing zero risk without profitable ventures survive world.  Telling people deal losing livelihoods authoritarian dystopia level bullshit. Oh arguing idealism Legit one saying “permanent mask policies”

Glad think masks depressing opposed people dying thousand. long don’t look masks I’m sure you’ll quite content even people dying needlessly feel bad 3rd 4th year med students pulled war zone public wouldn’t listen scientists doctors. Meanwhile,

on FDA's Imagine thinking someone doesn’t want injected rushed vaccine hasn’t studied long term effects silly one. Los Angeles really crowded all, unless you’re counting cars instead people. It’s sprawling city lower population density Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver.

The difference covid numbers LA SF give big hint problem lies. people high risk COVID due immunocompromised won’t able get it: taking 1 vaccine encourage tens thousands take theirs. I'll take ""horse shit"" 1000, Alex [RIP]... feel you- excited 'new decade' fresh start (personally). Then, 2020 turned purgatory. I'm superstitious person, I'm actually nervous getting hopes 2021. could really go feelings hope, point, though. Yeah mean didn’t feel thing year’s flu shot plan taking day covid one know guy drank cranberry juice lip singing Fleetwood Mac - things started looking up.  that, got I'm gonna vote, going get hopes till get vaccine. Starting really feel covid fatigue set feel like crazy one. family refuses isolate keeps partaking socail activities don’t want visit Christmas. It’s going living alone apartment foreseeable future. Really starting lose mind almost want risk getting covid even though know close vaccine. Ok second third wave production, version. Oh Yikes. love doublethink though. 

""Oh, UK rushed manufacturer data, FDA, GOLD STANDARD much carefully!

They literally approve days later. Ridiculous. 'Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist devised no-lockdown approach, estimated 40 per cent people capital, Stockholm, would immune Covid-19 end May': Also, people suffering dying restrictions, delayed cancer diagnosis surgeries. point think causing way harm preventing I'm Los Angeles I'm always pleasantly surprised see many people wearing masks. Even walking outside I'd say 90% people wearing masks. r/covid19positive

Good luck wish speedy recovery mention cases deaths contribute rising holidays pass even rumors true.. governments line.. including US government.

Pfizer give shit selling 3 boxes NFL.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: would easier Kraft call Trump.  one arguing authority it, point public wouldn’t follow follow guidelines even potus could/did issue nationwide set restrictions. people don’t follow guidelines wouldn’t follow lockdown mandated state governor either, matter. using mRNA technology, essentially same? even mixed. can’t print money, like feds can. moderna vaccine require normal fridge? That's works since fiscal policy tied federal government. one run deficit deal later never federal government. can’t even compare Iowa california. LA ppl entire state Iowa extremely densely populated. Ok please tell find official statement CDC promise least 99.97% certainty long term side effects. sure can’t find one can't get it? I'll last line anyways, time could get it, anyone truly vulnerable would already it. know supposed proud kid? mean come on. hard hearing can't understand people saying harsh that's definetly case people agree. need supply one two enough. Ok wise one. telling COVID, highly infectious flu/cold, transmitted without symptoms would cause transmission vaccine teaches body identify FIGHT enters body. Yes still get infected. Yes, already acknowledged scientists transmission possible studies need done. FAUCI STATES MASK WEARING WINTER 2021 EVEN THOUGH CLAIMS BREATH ""HERD IMMUNITY"" MONTHS. Go research. virus, someone yesterday told current rock bottom interest rates would stay constant, quote, ""forever"". going able large number shit again? wonder they'll bid beds? Oh that's states bidding ventilators. Literally restaurant indoor seating... Gee wonder why. Wearing mask even recommended rules arbitrary. Wear mask one second take seated restaurant. mention fact many people carry around mask, essentially snot rag probably making spread worse. worst all, forcing children, desperately need facial cues develop cover year. Hes taking high end forgetting perhaps 15% America already contracted virus. long novel virus emerges 😂 Yes, outside exhaust also filtered, protect people next apartment sidewalk.  medical negative-pressure patient rooms, outdoor exhaust required HEPA filtered.  home, duct HEPA-filtered air outside, best infection-control point view.  

One difficulty is, residences enough HVAC capacity heat (or cool) much fresh intake air, especially winter. 

If bedroom on-suite bathroom, exhaust fan bathroom provide negative pressure.  Taping HEPA filter intake grill exhaust fan, also protect neighbors. dead wrong needing it. get herd immunity need 70% population vaccinated. eradicate take closer 90%. flu cold, research refusing it. Funny mention bad-faith arguments. licensed drive, thing can't operate motor vehicle public roads. Society dictated that, **choose** drive, must prove know how. puts condition liberty.

Your original argument someone chooses vaccinated, must prohibited participating society. presume advocate device used, indicate taken shot. 

(I would suggest avoiding yellow stars device.) thanks! That's absurdly simplistic way look situation think looking answer want shame OP without knowing details.

Before anything assumed people getting sick job outside job. many taking seriously surprise infections occur outside work settings.

Also lot jobs done person manufacturing, maintainence, transportation. mean say ""second"" ""third"" vaccine, first one good enough? need refine more? read copy-pasted antivax forum, says AMA didn’t rescind study abroad year. exciting year far! take one severe allergies? Highly. highly. Really highly? little highly?  Hmmm. legitimate virus body ways shutting down. Good luck thank considering it. nursing baby looking sign trials lactating mothers. Huh. Thought using saline placebo, guess red bull. NL awful. data reading?

And even Germany fares better European countries, what, bar low. Tots Pears miss part pretty much virus free?  sucks I'm sorry going that. I'd like buy bridge 370 straight disappeared US ordered 100 million doses, enough 50 million people. orders sent come orders ahead production ramp up. I’m taking Pfizer sure Yeah conservative use ventilators I've heard, they're really used last ditch effort Maybe, plenty different views mine. think CEO high level view situation we’re focused individuals probably wont take anyway. 

If cant even supply want take worry dont? Executives get later still frontline taken care arent jumping line make people wont cant take yet happy Anyone heard get 2nd dose vaccine manufacturer? Like, get Pfizer first moderna 2nd? mRNA code protein?

Just worry supply chain issues here. might one supply day 1 day 21. wife conversation last night, gotten close incrementally. curious state peak start descend numerically. Newsom terrible job, or? know I'll ever stop wearing masks now. lack trust science, lack trust people live around me. well hopefully companies get flexible. know ton already pledged continue flexible full time remote forever, including mine. I, however, glad return office everyone part, working home week ish.  Welp happens ‘advisors’ don’t practice preach. *cough* *newsom* I'm talking big impacts, I'm comparing ""Rapid rollout risk"" ""Current projection."" mid-Feb, looking third less daily death rate, hospitalization rate, time lost illness, chance ongoing health problems younger folks (&lt;65 even &lt;50)

What's death rate folks 50? hospitalization rate. got it, I'd also love see average stay time hospital 50.

As ongoing health problems, there's lot info able ever find actual look cases young healthy people. Seems like studies like ""90% young people end hospital potentially permanent heart damage."" I'm denying happens, know actual numbers permanent damage/ongoing issues.

""Time lost illness"" less concern one weighed restrictions get place disease lethal (both death rate deaths per day) flu. Trump said pandemic would Easter.

Trump said vaccine would approved October, elections.

Trump said live fear virus need wear masks social distance.

He wrong time time again. Sad supporters overlook swallow jizz lies. don’t think experts concerned. I’m concerned either. problem one enabled phone time. 

I live Maryland/DC/Virginia area work grocery store regularly go three areas. 

I hope either develop one whole DMV fix whatever issue prevents once. Half 50 said would take said would consider year later line. don’t think someone who’s ignoring mask mandates considering vaccine. I’m strictly referring people adhere guidelines, like myself. wear mask even common areas home, don’t want risk infecting family. 

I continue I’m allowed get vaccine, I’ve gotten used mask now. I’m done caring people like guy you’re replying don’t get vaccinated think they’re experts. Great, moves one step ladder. sucks selfishness affect immune compromised people otherwise unable vaccinated. could taken child traveled, made arrangements interest child's health. 

In case woman stated: ""We flew summer"" - doubt travels absolutely essential - also vocal were, would mentioned emergency drive home point. absolutely helps work load fewer coworkers illness. Ive said elsewhere. used immunizing pharmacist taught courses immunizations. 

Immunizations arent shield. arent garlic preventing vampires biting you. 

They make body mount defense get invaded viruses. makes perfect sense think. get exposed vaccinated, may virus body. vaccinated allow defenses keep replication bay cant pass on. dont know fact. cpuld virus needs 5 copies spread reach vaccinated host. 


There lot assume guess shows prevent spread. Weve gotten really smart virology, damn im happy people love actual evidence. hard stay optimistic much optimism shown foolhardy.  No? I’m saying at-risk kids need attention isolation leaving way behind depends, governments manage properly distribute vaccines might sooner 2022.

Governments much experience vaccine rollouts chances better organized lockdowns.

Remote poor regions planet unfortunately last vaccinated, somewhere 2022.

A virus usually get worse, tend get contagious lethality rising would self defeating virus.

It happen 1918 pandemic war going sickest allowed leave trenches spread virus hospitals causing virus become lethal. case now, hospitals isolating covid-19 patients regular patients. know recent report hospital sad isolated case.

The virus might also mutate vaccines longer work new one needs developed tested (but platform would still work testing shorter)

I listen panel virologists podcast called ""This Week Virology"" seem agree type mutation unlikely corona virus.

Anti vaxxers serious problem need include vaccination program provide protection everyone. Putting jail good ways ensure compliance. example taking away right use public transportation visit public places like swimming pools, libraries, concerts, festivals...

We could use app indicates whether one vaccinated allow vaccinated people crowded public spaces example. insist asking examples mRNA vaccines approved actual trials prior COVID?

Keeping whatever you’re though. It’s funny. consider vaccine preventing someone infectious year road ""side effect"" said something similar bombarded people telling understand federal government vs states works. agree you, guidance come top form pandemic team. Wow. look overwhelmed overworked. someone US, ask would risk losing job talked public? covered worker's compensation ?

Or employer benefit liability exclusion carved Congress ? That's true. applies private businesses stores. Christians like Christians like family wear masks time go, that's God wants. can't really convince someone sees life temporary inconvenience way heaven. 

They also forget verses like: Proverbs 27:12 “A prudent person foresees danger takes precautions. simpleton goes blindly suffers consequences.”   Well... honest think semi evil pharma industry science two different things, trust science much someone whos profit nr.1 motivation really change initial statement. make act choice choosing apartment evicted. choice make...a rather difficult choice, albeit still choice. 

Your refusing admit fact life, things voluntary choices. course choice seem mandatory, however still choices. Theoretically, everyone city decide going work environmentally friendly transport options...then would happen...This indisputable fact. 

Instead rather sit comfortably ways blame ""the corporations"" ruining world...when effectively...they require do. Company pollute immensely shareholders require high returns...

40.3256\*-\*-9+63

0..

3+6- you’re saying it’s possible? /s  vaccine manufacturer knew side effects, without telling approvers, yet got approved. Hopefully EMA look papers correctly time since FDA problem 2009. 

Also I'm saying vaccines. saying everyone right skeptical, that's science based on. skepticism regarded higher others though *cough* facebook 5g groups *cough*  Death rates slow infection rates we're inoculating vulnerable people first. general public access vaccine case load decrease well expect months It’s proven scientists back September thah man made. There’s plenty articles it. Uh, saying doctors wrong?

Which part that? Ah, rugrat traumatized acting school, can't stand around. Yeah that's true EU basically gave countries carte blanche printing new money. Good point athletes politicians.

Though counter argument influential people might help get people take vaccine. i.e. bunch athletes get it, especially African American ones since community that's historically skeptical medicine... maybe would help uptick least younger people seeing hero's people respect getting it.

So see argument exceptions cases there's actual need alternatives. Perhaps American Samoas really impractical vaccinate two shots deep freezers due distance. Perhaps getting current former athletes vaccinate Instagram would help uptick.

Bush, Clinton Obama volunteered get front cameras reason. I'm sure many people Clinton persuade (white Democrats likely skeptical), maybe Obama (African American) Bush (Republican) convince skeptical supporters.

But speeding vaccination efforts expense rest world, especially countries repeatedly harmed actions past. totally rational take... United States basically 50 small countries one. COVID experience rural Georgia going VASTLY different experience urban California. Biden better give Presidential Medal Freedom. Lord knows deserves 1000 times fucking Rush Limbaugh. That's thing though. ability train score better testing surely sign aptitude. people, like wife, excel test taking. mental skill mental aptitude ability. talking pattern recognition, abstract conceptualisation, application.

I personally camp believe different types intelligence; tested IQ tests types test; IQ is, time being, come better metric. get good hear song 15th time row also amazing amounts grease skids make process easier.

From priority processing paperwork unfortunately abundant test volunteers aim open minded it, understand I'm privy nuances vaccine industry. say I'm informed enough know Bayer's distribution HIV contaminated medicine 80s, well teratogens pushed ""morning-sickness"" meds. I'm paranoid. I'm merely cautious experts people, people flawed.

Just humble piece advice, may want little graceful argue. preoccupied asserting know nothing, forgot provide information apparently missing (and perhaps have?). cap, I'd super interested learning vaccine manufacture approval process. think aware arent worried population Read comment stop trying twist it. I'm misrepresenting anything. ***You are.***

Again. Read one letter time need to:

***""S x  p r c p n   e...""***

I cannot make clearer since refuse acknowledge deaths, refuse accept happened refuse read article study links.

*(You fake news boy screen capture going memorable.)* Huh?   also saying get screwed years. - vaccine created quickly

- inventors say might still able catch covid, get sick spread it

- News outlets like NY times saying immune body nose, still wear mask, socially distance, etc

- 4 cases facial paralysis taking vaccine

- advised avoid vaccine food drug allergies

- unknown whether vaccine make infertile

- first dose supposed unpleasant side effects, getting second dose put ass 2 days

I see someone would want avoid taking risk thats reported benefits. mean pitch essentially ""Put brand-new cocktail stuff body. going unpleasant sure side effects are, also might offer much protection virus get closer going back normal. call today make first 2 appointments."" Why? need take it? youre worried it? Theyve got priorities. I’m hesitant rushed vaccine thays marketing teams for. need focus take wont going way make show taking ‘see dangerous’ causes concern bad couldn’t get VIP treatment. got infected people refusing wear masks follow guidelines. kinda feel nursing homes/old people 70+ get vaccinated first since ease hospitilzations health care workers..I mean maybe not, argument made He/she 4lokomotive people thread also seeing negatives early vaccine... Im anti vaxxer everything fishy. covid sucked still going run first vaccine it. mention lots ""allergic"" reactions Europe. Idk hate want opinion odd me. Something higher play here. Makes sense! Thanks. mum nurse hospital unsound mind (was called 'Mental Hospital' back 80s, know correct way say today), kinds problems visitors rarely them. Imagine butthurt getting vaccines. Infertility big one know either way. belief this, prefer wait see science community discovers information one way another. 

You hand seem confident know sure man made. Rupert Murdoch Koch. funding Fox wackjob news sites. definitely reduce transmittability (word?), although eliminating completely? There's focus live animal markets offering wild exotic game, confident Huanan market source initial outbreak? credibility idea could result lab mismanagement? whether realized would make little difference print

they'll print whatever think sensationalist RIP Cali. There's always someone swearing birthplace atrocity humanity. get points saying stuff it, stupid, evil, malignant operative pretending stupid? stupid even know?

Do zero people skills, going way hostile possible anyone offering different perspective? another request:

Keep extremely important work. grateful this.

The next pandemic might well contagious virus causes slow chronic infection, straightforward vaccination possible.

As one shows, politicians yet capable adequate measures. need way better alarms legal frameworks force politicians act. Hey kids!

Did like story Little Orphan Annie? like Charles Dickens story Oliver Twist? ever wonder would like orphan? Santa delivering Christmas wish. get go orphanage! - I’m practising lawyer. 

Your argument hilariously backwards you’ve defeated argument making it. moronically bad take. federal insurance good is, wonder someone pulling leg. US something right EU. Suck it, continentals! Interesting, thanks. guess that's reduces spread without stopping completely. part people (in US anyway) often say ""I'm nurse!"" means anything LPN took like year's worth courses community college, Master's Science nursing, obviously far rigorous. (Of course Nurse Practitioners well, usually say ""I'm nurse"".) point is, term means many different things, actually include would consider working knowledge science.

I'm engineer, even healthcare person whatsoever, someone practice science living, noticed the, um, less credentialed ""I'm nurse"" types say things absolutely stand reason, would immediately recognizable anyone type science background. Yet, people like, ""Look, nurse said something feeds knee-jerk confirmation biased opinion!"" that's people thinking jury's things actually significantly on. get caught world close vaccine know top scientists seen entire process havent little reason doubt themselves, else would corrected issue found die placebo. spread nonsense.

They received placebo died... received placebo offered protection. Yes, please this. 

The media limited time pick perspective narrative present time available, result things left out, sometimes deliberately.

It people recording publishing videos flag-draped coffins offloaded cargo holds passenger planes turned tide recent spate foreign wars, since images 100% absent nightly news.

This that, now. times something like happened?

Every anti vaxxer know can’t remember many presidents damn know Tuskegee experiments I’d never heard coming sub Right? ignore pandemic want, point, reality going catch you. longer takes, worse snap back reality be, people suffer die, longer takes recover terms public health economics. points us took time really brush pandemics, public health responses understood since first started hearing reports China serious situation Wuhan became way back January February. tools information literally hundreds studies past pandemics expertise thousands public health experts, largely ignored discounted. could spent billions avoid trillions losses.

Climate change always even larger, even looming threat, hope spurs officials take things seriously, really bottom bad things get take action avoid worst outcomes. vaccine gets rolled millions hundreds people die soon after. Nothing vaccine. people would died regardless. Someone dies heart disease every 37 seconds US. unfortunate reality news outlets try make baitclick articles. “Man dies heart attack hours receiving vaccine.” 

People good separating National statistics world. Everyone family would tell violent crimes worse today number years ago. reality amount violent crimes per capita lowest since 1950s. I’m talking pandemic. 

This table shows homicide rate since 1950 example. That’s encouraging People consume animal products level anti maskers, easily avoid risk choose selfish reasons. many healthcare workers US / get vaccinated end Dec / jan point? That's people going hard time understanding. 

The infection rate drop, probably quickly sharply, deaths continue maintain raise drop slightly. 

Just like month ago infections starting skyrocketing saw deaths rising thought lighter strain. 

Nope, deaths come weeks infection. deaths always delayed, down.  right try flying kid. Airlines right refuse service need to. people tend get rights go ways think going still wear mask going grocery store over. love first year gotten cold anything else. 15 year old wants actively visit grandparent? Bless child. It’s labeling somebody conspiracy theorist equated religious extremist...

Unfortunately, seen actual two integrate recently lot people one ideals I'm really frustrated reading anti vaxxers subreddit. Turns anti vaxxers ""COVID hoax"" people, also people want lockdowns continue indefinitely. use ""I'm anti vaxxer, but..."" line talk distrusting vaccine. Reading comments thread Pfizer's CEO revealing tells us 53% Americans willing take vaccine. 

If people reason we're back normal summer 2021, spite multiple vaccines efficacy, I'm going angry. best one I’ve found vaccines turns 5G antennas 🤣 ""...and appears prevent spread virus well""

KNEW IT! fucking knew it! told Moderna Pfizer provided sterilizing immunity, listen me! Look who's laughing now! listened Hotzendorf, boi! like lot hypotheses come true? surprised pandemic, not?  
Did read Ed Yong's piece Atlantic? think science changed forever pandemic? think someone says ""I bet"" beginning statement, usually means compiled evidence go it. Fat known healthy. tons sources fat without saturated fat. Ooo, semi-real response acknowledge vaccine risks! spoke allergic reaction risk, transverse myelitis autoimmune risks, least acknowledged vaccine safe certain individuals. 

Was hard admit wrong? response sure sounds like PR statement though, definitely adding accusations others made. bet it.... ..how many labs in, professor? however increase % positive well We're printing money diverting funds. yes, Dutch government help businesses affected pandemic. likely choice. Take get get it.  Well shit never pay whatever tuition costs 2040 sign up! fact multiple companies making multiple vaccines makes think thing control sooner later. Time magazine misinformation? get it. tell anyone who's it. I'm ignoring quote. 

Do anything would like specifically expand think ignoring? $12k monthly income 'n' can't pay hospital bill. welcome america mr. director security white house. exactly everyone paying insurance month month month?

does Trump know gofundme, already boarded Marine One get golfing relieve rage? tests, cases! Easy done! /s hugely encouraging. ""Can vaccinated people still transmit virus?"" major open question significant implications quickly return normal happen.

YES... can... ""carrying capacity"" ability vector fo virus severely diminished.

We model viral outbreak what's called r0 (r-naught) average number new people infected covid-positive person.

For covid 3...

If vaccinated probably significantly &lt; 1.0 means self-sustaining would die out.

What lot people understand vaccines 100% effective need be. 

If 95% people either catch covid recover much much faster ten that's need. 

If vaccinated still catch covid body deals really easily might even know.

Best still wear masks though.

Source... background medical science data science spent +25 years modeling graph theory, epidemiology, viral distribution, etc. Lol well, owner Lunchables won’t let kids eat let alone himself... No, precaution there's imbalance cases. case number within expected background number. potential side effect they're saying monitor it. marketing drugs devices monitored side effects perpetuity. saying seen, Medway hospital empty, Brighton empty well one local town. Pro-Trump acquaintance mine says first person US getting vaccinated black proof Trump isn’t racist. done many terrible things can't punished it. could they? Think it. Even currencies right still stuck US dollar. believe that's good idea, see 2008 crash. expect another event right around corner. refuse play ball end like Libya. Well that's fucking cool! Good her, statement. Sad everything political statement days great way it. True. state relevant Europe US. Since heard anything actual vaccination proof cards distributed, likely choice wear mask public places pandemic declared ""over"". way telling vaccinated treat everyone vaccinated. Come on, man... dogpile away. I'm telling truth! report post got owned.

***6 PEOPLE DIED CLINICAL TRIALS PFIZER DRUG. FOUR DIED PLACEBO. TWO DIED VACCINE.***

You lose. Insert Coin Take Vaccine. It’s ironic spreading disease brings “some sense normalcy trying times”...isn’t precisely lacking normalcy?!  Plus, people get vaccinated see there’s side effects, everyone fence open rolling sleeve up.

This angered people sub's reaction initial skepticism. going go time went time would weeks, years. many cases/deaths matter dozens vaccines development, they've developed types people, people immunocompromised.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* They're overwhelmed Thank clarifying numbers. 1,676 terrible sample size. little info backgrounds locations subjects also help. study's results tells us little big picture. part understand dope swag money? thought pretty civil. reddit dreamland. Opportunity stay home avoid real world + opportunity constantly shit rich people/conservatives/religious people/anyone die virus. Scientists never prove anything, provide evidence support hypothesis. Canucks fan here! want leave US finally go Vancouver watch hockey again. think purpose question long term safety vaccine? 

Usually people wait data prove something safe calling safe. data long term safety affects pregnant women women becoming pregnant. 

I think problem people saying vaccine safe absolute terms, instead honest things know it.

I think better ways describe safety vaccine commonly parroted places. Saying something like ""The vaccine shown incredibly safe short term, assume safe long term despite information prove that. assuming better society get vaccine without long term testing wait long term testing people die virus meantime.""

I think that's accurate way talking vaccine people say ""it's proven safe"". Hey man, need get personal. understand difference speed acceleration get point trying make. I'm looking CDC numbers nationally right cases per 100k I'll happily admit I'm wrong.

Quick edit crucify me: acceleration* cases per 100k.  Thank aggressive, hard good conversation online days I'm happy REEEE earlier 😂 bit miffed bring sound arguments consider. 

I'm sorry go that. trust vaccines, trust government big pharma act best interest (TBH think act people's best interest). I'm personally pulling wait see. continue mask socially distance, I'll wait see affects others first. fine line, I'll admit I'm wrong I'll take it. There's nothing done, wait natural immunity vaccine, whichever comes first. Bexsero aka 4CMenB. invasive disease caused bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. protect nasal colonization. Yeah, understand science minor strain, infecting hundred people right now, resistance vaccine gains dominance post-vaccine era. known unknowns big issue. Oh, vaccine. effective it, though? feel weird fact one shot vaccine instead two-shot vaccine like well-known candidates. Time nationalization. True significant though right? wait Pfizer proven safe.

I'll bite. else needs tell safe? ridiculous anecdote trumps actual proper data hospitalisations. course. California never really reopened March lockdown beating Texas Florida daily cases per capita. Many people around CA totally disillusioned lockdown measures - relatively strict measures months, looks like going end exact place relatively less strict states anyway. Yeah i’m maybe leaning definitely. dont think good make show ill give em try, not? always hates Chad dick lol pfizer 4-0


When dealing small numbers, get poisson noise -counting noise data still. 'gut' reaction seeing 4-0 drawing conclusion human do, logical look stats. 

If numbers become lopsided, I'd concerned. is, well within expected background cases, inflammation thought trigger - also 5% patients good recovery - even vaccine induced inflammation causes anything. calculation life certain tolerance acceptable damage people.

That people wear masks distance right say justify behavior. different. want say too, want jinx especially I've running outside cold. one possibly thought would never end, refuse believe anyone stupid thought Kobe dying going worst thing happen year. Wow, wrong. Yup, taxpayers ""toeing"" line. agree srntiment, faith pharmaceutical companies people run asshats. guarantee publicity stunt. Well, may first (second) person thread knows something law around vaccinations. 

However, SCOTUS affirmed local authority require people get vaccinated smallpox smallpox epidemic. Lol think people actually enjoy quarantined? seeing families friends? worry catching/spreading disease whenever get groceries? Never able travel?

Yeah people like able work home, can’t imagine anyone extreme shut-ins actually hoping last *longer*. mean end day, Newsom can’t halve population density LA, Ventura Orange County. 

There’s good testing infrastructure CA, things like thing really do. Even locks down, there’s virtually enforcement huge amounts non compliance. Yep need get people agree actually vaccinated opposed the:

""I'm anti-vaxxer, but""....

""I'll wait people take first"" (even though vaccines tested ten thousands volunteers) can’t get sick vaccine. actual virus. However people already sick prior getting vaccine, get vaccine actually get sick. it’s also possible vaccine get infected show symptoms, pass (we don’t know extent happens yet). google capricious hah. Maybe hesitant, thats assumption never said wouldnt take it. 

I personally think making big show prove safety isnt right move CEO likely isnt surrounded people dont believe it, product. Truly said mate. Well, live sort symbiotic relationship surprised What? Yeah, cases guess? though, guy implied Sweden try protect elderly. trying keep things factual :) open TX already.  definitely blindly trust anything. also susceptible cognitive bias. Here, focusing 1 2, shit, maybe even 1,000 times science wrong, completely ignoring billions times science correct. weighed events evenly might say blind faith science deserved. 

Not saying blind faith science good thing, type argument 100% logical. top (and frankly obvious) reasons vaccine Tuskagee experiments nothing other.

There still risk vaccine long term unknowns, guess what? Covid. least one things trying help actively trying kill you. feel you. SO’s father got (he’s well, far, though), hearing someone love made feel instantly nauseous. cant wait hug friend Public use reason refuse talk tracer call Four people given saline injection died shortly after.

You know holocaust conspiracy theory, right? Right??

(Edit: WHOA... look king Reddit basement floor - even need look post history, met match son!! 

A quick hover shows messed really game! Quick, call cops lol.) Oh man you’re spreading shit elsewhere everyone else calling stupid 🤣

Why scared vaccine? really get tired seeing bad things look humanity thread vaccine developed year. Considering common Bell's Palsy is, feel like best we're going get study number people got vaccine got Bell's Palsy, taking probability compared prevalence among general population.

If lower, big deal. noticeably higher, maybe standard deviation higher, going bigger issue right now. awful human I'm pathetic I'm healthy enough receive vaccine? trying say? want acknowledge individuals health problems make receiving vaccine dangerous would prove wrong? 

I think can't admit wrong acknowledge vaccine risks. Pathetic. Thats reasonable opinion dude. ?

Get vaccine grandmother. long-term side effects, live see them. I'd wait traditional type vaccine / wait Pfizer proven safe.

I honestly know prick. Sir Wendy’s... get pfizer moderna both? It’s there’s lot people US aren’t actually nurses claim be. There’s various levels nursing assistants say they’re nurses. them, extent education less 1 year program focusing proper way wipe ass. 

People actual registered nurses tend pretty intelligent follow science. high-risk population vaccinated hospitalizations drop deaths drop, start resuming normal lives?

Does number cases really matter much deaths low risk hospitals overrun? agree. weird first, mask wearing become new norm I’m totally fine it. Doesn’t prevent need do, way seen sign respect health others yourself. feel bad. thought 2020 would year also dead wrong. like 17 years. understand that, yes - point even vaccine 0.01% chance *killing* people (which obviously doesn’t) would still preferable letting coronavirus go unchecked fewer people would die.

It’s shit reality world without perfect solutions pandemic. Please take care mental health. This.  sentiments 2021 pretty clear better worse compared 2020. I'll take it. Oh God made feel really old Sometimes weak immune systems never show symptoms. Symptoms evidence strong immune reaction. he's fine now, that's good. Congratulations dodging bullets. Okay say mean beginning. Follow question you: epidemiologic point view, relevance msm coverage states discussion? need respond, answer ""fucking nothing."" Look case numbers, like 1/16 people virus. point assume everyone premise question faulty. know quite bit it, available data shows risks taking vaccine orders magnitude lower risks conferred catching COVID. might want learn visceral means lol  Nighthawkinlight pretty neat stuff iirc, good suggestions?  dont anything else right? Im disappointed get better name too. bound better whatever millennials make next gen. Soon back im going movie theaters, every restaurant exist every mall. need make year lost time months Last read 4 million signed No. Everything total derailed stream nonsense really related original comment. 

I look hx ran issue them, infuriating. insulting, dismissive, diverted topic unable answer single question, accused making things up, *lied* previously said statements, they're place thread trying dismiss anyone concern. acted like doctors stupid avoiding vaccine despite risks poses autoimmune conditions, hell even tried act like second injection issue anymore despite fact still is. 

I see got accusations did, doubly come back felt like PR approved message insufferable troll hour. felt like realized dismissive accusation work get approval higher acknowledge virus poses risks people. 

If they're part something bigger they're insufferable. acquaintance mine, who's nurse, posted pics kids Santa. masks anyone. We're Arizona, things terrible here. People crazy. Sorry, buying it. know Florida fudging numbers suppressing data. Yes, wildfires made air pollution worse year Yep, exactly. probably take least February majority vulnerable even received first poke. truly effective say is, see massive decline hospitalizations death April. Go troll somewhere else. reply anti vaccine stuff threads, bother answering easily found answers subreddit. problem one enabled phone time.

And U.S. state state (or territory) rollout mortally flawed start…

Where live, I’d need run two state trackers simultaneously even remotely effective. imagine live tri-state/territory border zone like find even useless. lost husband's dad early pandemic. Everyone would tell us, ""You're one I've ever heard affected."" Times changing.  putting timeline really something anyone predict. get hopeful, let's also set disappointment, too! good antivaxxer dead antivaxxer pandemic never said masks work.

Comparing results decision others trying handle problem different way deflecting? That's normal analysis handling. 

All things relative. 1 death many reason people say x countries well virus much better control countries.

What quoted even argument. possible long term side effects vaccine, would also possible long term side effects COVID. since long term side effects COVID fairly common, far unheard vaccine, risks vaccine far outweighed benefits protection COVID. That’s works!

Stop spreading political biased BS! Later that. US secured enough doses 100 million people right now. Pfizer Moderna cannot guarantee additional doses June 2021. still 228 million Americans without dose accounted yet. What's wrong cats lambs? They're super cute soft.  course war. Harder sanctions cyber attacks troll farms. Maybe you’re aware, article linked 2018 add this, whole blood donations tested covid antibodies (at least American Red Cross) antibodies tell specially label units. even antibodies, contributing blood supply overall always good thing. traumas cases need blood product stopped, donations slowed every little bit helps.

Edit- donor donations. plasma tested every time donate. No. could wrong it’s worth clarifying heard immunity != zero transmission. means likely won’t see massive large scale outbreaks. micro-transmissions still real problematic shouldn’t diminished Human population size consumption. factors drive else, three biggest problems planet: pandemic threats, climate change, loss biological diversity. mobile hospitals? military? emergency ships? fact said masks work, shortage irrelevant California gyms, bars, dinning restaurants closed seeing people outside household banned. problem police enforcement people Coronavirus.

Ah yes dream. understand it'd easy shuffle nightmare territory since that's mine start off, too.  

COVID lethal flu across board, unknowns potential long-term health issues. It’s *less* lethal younger folks, it’s still worse flu (besides much prevalent without control measures). cavalier treatment flu already criminal (and economically costly). Flu killed estimate 3,000 people 50 2019-2020 season, estimate 37 million symptomatic cases age ~8 million confirmed COVID cases &lt;50 early November leading 10k COVID deaths We’re certainly undercounting symptomatic COVID cases don’t see way get “just flu” per-case basis. keep mind total case counts *with* containment efforts seriously dampened flu transmissions - without could easily hit 3-4x total deaths 50.

Lost work time doesn’t come hospitalizations - COVID often severe enough take people work week (or several) even aren’t hospitalized decided one isolate ill. Like flu, it’s productivity tragedy commons reliance individual choice reluctance support good public policy (usable, socially acceptable sick leave, masks flu season, etc) leads economic loss cost policies. clearly failed elementary school math cant tell difference 100% current deaths 5% current deaths according vaccination plan summer.

There nothing equivalent two Bullshit government manipulation COVID.

Have less testing days = less tests = equal less positives = feel good government story. Can’t temp supply chain, step temp right gets end users.

But saying never tested it, don’t know. taking conservative safe route. mom /s  signed it, I’ll shocked enough people voluntarily use effective all. offered one declined. Thats slippery slope nazi Germany personally seen single store Indiana legitimately enforcing mask mandate. interesting times becomes less less overtly selfish go stuff there's room reasonable 

Reasonable disagreement... let's hope turns way, I'm optimistic. last months proven COVID restrictions very... uh, touchy subject. 
 
We're going people decide they're going back normal when: 
 
* Cases/deaths start dropping 
 
* Cases/deaths become background noise 
 
* Cases/deaths essentially nil 
 
and three groups hate other. going shitshow. sir surprising all, 24 states bypassed Florida virus cases last two months per capita basis, right, lockdowns always work everywhere positive, please keep mask on, leave home.

Wear whenever cold/flu symptoms. Covid disease kills people weak immune systems. You’re brave I've herd something like before. Woah way arm. scary.

I wonder ever tabulate many hidden victims were.


Yeah issue area. Ontario Canada. Mass indoor gatherings. Schools definitely fit mass indoor gathering. way make kids wear masks smear boogers one another. way get good ventilation. Christmas parties probably cause another wave. summer parties least outdoors. January February quite frustrating me, lot disease scientists sources — whole thing predictable, yet governments proving unprepared.

Can prevent happening again? Well, it’s unlikely prevent future spillovers dangerous viruses wild animals — 8 billion us humans planet, hungry greedy extract resources natural world. prevent spillovers becoming epidemics pandemics—with science, strong public health measures, good national leadership, community cooperation. four elements, case first two.

Lesson future? Ecological disruption human consumption bring new viruses represent pandemic threats. There's thing called ""wishful thinking"" confirm. site two weeks ago 6 cases week, last week 11, nine week far. Remember USA Iran barely avoided conflict? It’s different vaccinate children flu, even it’s 100% effective. Contrast people deliberately putting others harm’s way. US least, don’t get vaccine. right. certainly lose access things without though. like measles vaccine requirements public school meningitis vaccine universities. People shouldn’t confuse rights privileges. Driving privilege right, one example. BioNTech mRNA research since 2008. two weeks, otherwise everyone would done it. course invent everything. science. live there’s much CoVid you’d think, it’s holiday season everyone’s still migrating like CoVid isn’t happening I’m sure shoot right soon again

All snow birds whereas number one weren’t 0.5%, well within 95% confidence interval. vaccines good enough taken enough people herd immunity mean zero transmission. eradicated smallpox planet vaccines polio exists Pakistan Afghanistan vaccines. 

It entirely possible even likely though still see small-scale Covid transmission vaccination. happen vaccines approved Moderna Pfizer aren’t effective large numbers people refuse vaccination. yes, shouldn’t dismiss impact continued transmission. Anyone spend stimulus check something materialistic? Reddit seems saved spent rent. Nobody want stick neck  legal standing force people allow service unvaccinated people? far know, refuse service reason all, long it’s protected class. think it’d hard task prove vaccination status somehow falls protected clas mean, that’s ever wanted anyways! science never wrong........ Exactly. episode Daily last week discussed scenarios normalcy depending many Americans get vaccinated. highly recommend listen it. 28 minutes long. Historians always prefer first hand account events soon possible happened. Time chinese whispers ruin accuracy eventually. guy federal employee? already health disability insurance feds. Salaries usually lower insurance pretty comprehensive. guess question drug companies killed people opioids? I'll take one company lowest death toll.  personnel out, even quarantine exposure huge burden workload. Vaccinated staff wearing PPE would longer quarantine, listing single biggest station resources. sure understand this, pretty obvious real knowledge situation. Exactly. Track react appropriate.

If competent government I'd say shut next couple months compensation drop curve quickly possible everyone getting vaccinated. Everyone wants ""normal"" nobody wants put work. Americans would mean staying hunkered receiving paycheck, seems hard people seems.

The US especially pretty privileged we've secured large number vaccines immunize everyone nation short order. FOMO (fear missing out) also caused millions people go living lives despite actually worrying virus. Even Fauci said hit herd immunity end spring, warp speed head thinks normal May. far far earlier November 2021. Why? vaccinated, would keep wearing it? Seriously irresponsible putting dates like there’s still many unknowns.

The comments suggest going lot people dealing depression March. anyone ever stand poor pharma billionaires responsible destruction American healthcare system millions resulting deaths???

Because he's bad billionaire deserve say body?

Don't get wrong, sympathy guy even think *anyone* entitled millions even billions property. That's fucked one rich powerful.

However, also fucked treat human rights something granted like.

And honestly, self-made problems like lack wellfare state.... care anymore. Tho, suspect lot guy drank cool aid ""freedom"" ""socialism"" *to extent* (I blame you). sure pointing fingers indulging vengeance fantasies get there, tho. 100 years late *that* party. Hah! 

As said, good work making people less likely take vaccine. Good work. Many businesses social media rules say post anything seen derogatory towards company image fired. post patients could violating HIPPA laws (patient privacy laws) making company look bad. 

So post bad working conditions affect company cause loss revenue confidence business. Since real way fairly address issues ""court public opinion"" companies want prevent disgruntled workers (people fair conditions dicks) hurting image. make severe rules enforce zero tolerance. Thank I’ll read this

It’s sad, it’s normal skeptical. 

There loads Really Bad ThingsTM happened earth one instance govt isn’t gonna enough sway getting vaccine lol. intention logical conversation positives negatives vaccine. people want talk positives ignore negatives assume positives outweigh negatives. 

Why would someone conversation like this? people need type agenda discuss this? online discussion vaccine safety data.

On individual level, people might want wait couple months non mRNA vaccine approved, especially young women might thinking becoming pregnant. traditional types vaccines proven little long term effects, trustworthy point, although mRNA vaccines could build trust time goes on.

I willing point data shows safe, I'm willing point data show safety. would someone want discuss one other? really miss toasted white chocolate capps dont trust people atm. dont wanna see people sip test building one even following basic 6 foot rule. NEET Oxford single shot 5 years reach $12 hour ? respect, even associates would help boost past pay levels. 100m covers elderly, HC high risk 90%+ effectiveness drops Covid many times deadly flu pneumonia significantly less deadly.

Now issue still remains immune compromised can’t vaccinated can’t mount immune response, even ‘herd immunity’ 250m vaccinations we’ll probably still Covid circling around never eradicated. one near walk-in store.

Dude literally snorted ants

He’ll live people sub insane  That’s difficult say. certainly increase vigilance response capacity pandemics. change ways relate one another?—socializing, hugging, going movies concerts, traveling? don’t know. Sorry, can’t even imagine changes may play out. biggest hope awful event makes us cognizant destructive, insatiable relationship natural world, based human population size (equally important) scope consumption individuals affluent countries. Ah, thought saying ineffective year saying shedding actually caused vaccine itself? It’s not, it’s bad reporting. FDA discusses page 48 basically says “the trial didn’t look don’t know”

Then warns wearing masks even getting vaccinated happened popular mainstream media fact based assessments vaccine delivered 2021? desk workers show faces TV get reliable source information? common accepted opinion change? None friends family it, finally last week best friends girlfriend got it. 

I see numbers realize it’s getting bad area, always thought weird one knew gotten it. anybody awe regarding achievement ignorant entitled piece shit.

Can’t come soon enough LONDON (Reuters) - Five key genes linked severe form COVID-19, scientists said Friday, research also pointed several existing drugs could repurposed treat people risk getting critically ill pandemic disease.

Researchers studied DNA 2,700 COVID-19 patients 208 intensive care units across Britain found five genes involved two molecular processes - antiviral immunity lung inflammation - central many severe cases.

""Our results immediately highlight drugs top list clinical testing,"" said Kenneth Baillie, academic consultant critical care medicine Edinburgh University co-led genome-wide association study.

The genes - IFNAR2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9 CCR2 – partially explain people become desperately sick Covid-19, others affected, Baillie said.

The findings, published journal Nature, help scientists speed search potential drugs COVID-19 conducting clinical trials medicines target specific antiviral anti-inflammatory pathways.

Among potential, said, class anti-inflammatory drugs called JAK inhibitors, includes arthritis drug baricitinib, made Eli Lilly.

Baillie's team also found boost activity INFAR2 gene could create protection COVID-19, likely mimic effect treatment interferon.

Various existing drugs explored clinical trials potential COVID-19 including interferon-beta-1a, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Sanofi's arthritis drug Kevzara.

So far, steroid called dexamethasone newly developed antiviral called remdesivir, made Gilead, drugs authorised around world treat COVID-19 patients - although remdesivir recommended severe cases disease mixed results trials.

Last month, U.S. Food Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly's antibody drug COVID-19, bamlanivimab, patients hospitalized risk serious illness age conditions.

Unfortunately, focused bad reporting. document link blurb page effectiveness transmission SARS-CoV-2
Data limited assess effect vaccine transmission SARS-CoV-2 individuals infected despite vaccination. Demonstrated high efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 may translate overall prevention transmission populations high enough vaccine uptake, though possible efficacy asymptomatic infection lower efficacy symptomatic infection, asymptomatic cases combination reduced mask-wearing social distancing could result significant continued transmission. Additional evaluations including data clinical trials vaccine use post-authorization needed assess effect vaccine preventing virus shedding transmission, particular individuals asymptomatic infection.

The trial wasn’t designed measure this. It’s complex that, even though conclusion pinned post it’s totally fine, states still quick development period may side effects.

I’m suggesting it’s worth taking, it’s dangerous. Vaccines across board safer even average person believes, still new type vaccine known awhile, studied traditional RNA, could previously unknown potential side effects.

I one getting soon can, it’s distributed at-risk groups. lots strains. None different enough avoid vaccine natural immunity. CA wrong? Netherlands least matter.

Good science takes time, don’t time develop vaccine, although, large pool people taking it, idea efficacy lot sooner studied years.

It's amazing. Go simp genocidal emperor somewhere else, scum. Public schools Ngl covid first hit shores anticipation PMs speeches every days, could feel dread weighing everyone around you. felt like entire country darkened really reminiscent SARS hit (for us remember).

I 11 first SARS knew serious, really appreciate critical situation was. time, half family working healthcare essential jobs, legitimately awful. I'm glad almost over, feel like crying sometimes. tradition Good see EMA started realize emergency situation. Also, kudos Jens Spahn German Federal Government lighting fire EMA's arse. Anti vax peeps totally respond well this. scares me. someone frequent dislocations, I’m worried I’ll need go ER, won’t able helped. Good. personally taking every vaccine can, it’s way know sure took right one. can’t wait mandated anti-vaxxers rounded quarantined get herd immunity. new, last 10 years. covid 19 vaccine experimental, it’s development less year. FIRST licensed mRNA vaccine US. 

While can’t speak normal development process takes longer, say it’s reasonable people unsure taking something rushed through. 

As engineer, things rushed, corners cut. understand vaccine probably safe use there’s still unknowns vaccine’s long term effects efficacy.

What? state even enough doses cover healthcare workers. Id say father isnt them, Revolution Radio really gave American Idiot vibes, mentioned Jesus Suburbia Outlaws.

So, clearly ""line"" he's jumping exist everywhere country phasing vaccine distribution recommendation, government leaving individual company/hospital decide distribute vaccines receive.  


Unfortunately, we've seen past masks, follow recommendations, won't. hospital work stated mandate emergency use status. sure legal moral take. similar techique mRNA vaccines development Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. case used therapeutic Covid-19 infections. Really shows many different things made using RNA/DNA technology people think vaccine would faked? Wait til hear moon landing, sandy hook, holocaust. already ""BIDEN GOT WATER VACCINE!!!"" head taking applications? side effects almost never develop weeks later. many vaccines side effects emerge years later since first vaccine came 1700's?  vaccines get approved, doses available poorer countries. Pfizer, Moderna, etc. there's whole second round vaccines starting clinical trials.

One roadblocks holding approval vaccines ability enroll volunteers trials. doubly important people starting get vaccinated developed countries.

I work organization called [COVID Trial Dash](http://coviddash.org) trying bring attention issue giving potential volunteers map find trials near them. Check us out, especially US. trials running many major cities even added coming months. Others might argue fair he's CEO gets vaccine there's lots people dying.

***Another 39 percent said would wait see vaccine works people getting themselves.*** Nine percent would get vaccine required work, school another activity. Twelve percent said would probably take vaccine, 15 percent said would definitely get vaccinated — even free determined safe scientists. people care public perception reality. 

The public perception CEO gambling shady unethical croney good look. trust more? pharma executive taking company's product vs one doesn't? 

Anti vaxxers trust pharma ceo even claim take it. know well read articles, headlines.

So lie article? Dude festivals tickets got cancelled it’s Spotify, vinyl, deafening music home. Green Day got real shit dude, can’t listen new stuff, isn’t them. terrible idea denied permit means ""Don't go,"" ""ignore rules try sneak across jetski""

He's complete asshat hate break exclusively UK sub, is, fact, COVID-19 sub spooky many people think vaccine turn zombie. remember anti-vaxxers vast minority :( Even education small things like logical fallacies easily taught kids. Instead whatever else emphasizing. willingness continue increase people die, lockdown fatigue grows, vaccine rolled widely. publicity stunt, Pfizer super corrupt.

Pfizer 80 cases violations pay $4,747,652,947 since want 61k Americans (at absolute minimum) die good reason?

[Even 'Bad' Flu Vaccine Could Save 61,000 Lives 

What mystery 🙄. would they? going blast people poor logic examining logic? side effects, however improbable, could take years develop, would million people taking vaccine instill sense confidence semi-reasonable persons head? Either already trusted couple years everything known. Germany funded vaccine (USA UK not), that's pay less vaccine that's get vaccine soon approval done. need people trust science. Thank better many us.  can't begin express admiration people like you. Thank Right. Definitely. shareholders must well-being country people mind, profit. I'm sorry hear that. May ask many people know covid? roughly 35 know, one (an 83 year old) died. others described flu less. Losing 5 seems mean know incredibly high number it. Either way, sorry losses. Ignorant people get even worse backed corner let every excuse fly instead owning mistake. fucking hate people this.  Time anecdote: 
  
Back (old) day, Denmark, made lot cannons. Propbably war Brittons stole entire navy something. We're talking gunpower age wooden ships shit.

ANYWAYS... canons came crucibles rapid haste. lot exploded first used. Causing massive friendly fire dismemberment exploding metal. Apparently production rushed brink. make sure happen, king ordered makers cannon fire first shot themselves.  


Suddenly new cannons well made GREAT condition. summer full concerts, 4 goin strong. One bands even saved me, like gave reason keep pushing. Sounds basic fuck, band Green Day😅 That's good hear. following Brazilian politics closely, thanks answer. Yeah -- Trump entire staff including Giuliani get top care, access monoclonal antibodies (when nobody get them), fine. ones allowed happen.

Meanwhile everyone else gets die. big red banner every hospital's front entrance sign ""Closed"". people still get ""oh, im barely get sick. didnt flu years"". regarding uncle, dad one. Yeah figured need take military response able authorize defense production  Ya seen Legend ?!?!!??! /s Yea, agree. believe nurses valuable members medical community greatly respect do. However, I’ve heard many medical field easy become nurse how...dumb (not personal belief, quoting friend nursing school here) many are, don’t really trust opinion. medical knowledge honestly even comparable doctors, overwhelming majority physicians support vaccine, so....I’m gonna trust scientists docs here. job title ""scientist"" mean principles scientific method followed X experiment/field research.

Really like use word ""trust"" kind context. method help understand world observation, testing hypotheses, rigorous validation/challenging results. take trust belief understand method best tool understand world around us.

Distrusting people institutions whole story valid conversation there. efficacy scientific method debate. take spot line wish true, reality not.

See that? That's you. we've spend half thread explaining basic things you, over. 

As paranoia list, I'll ask again. evidence fears founded reality?  pc gamer. I'd resell gifted PS5. could sentiment want information make decision. plenty cases even professionals abstaining making decisive conclusion even amassed large amount data appears promising. Covid vaccine yet go final stage testing (i.e. full public release). someone still reluctant decide whether believe something safe even finished testing, mean never make decision. complex again. look closely specifically said “I impression.” asserting. claiming pure omnipotence. bringing fact real life experience masks felt relevant discuss. relish finding new information changing perspective.


Your ego hand seems make Great Wall China look mundane. yes absolutely find warranting title “Asshole”. Far people deserve. that’s random internet insult really brings satisfaction.

You insufferable wretch must plague subjected far satisfying know last gets reciprocated actual social interactions you. Like going stay way while, let’s face it. People don’t change personality trait large life altering consequences catalyze it. Yes nutty also unethical illogical ....then bring em airplane? forget blanket labelling everyone anti-vax gets karma. I'm pro vaccine I'm also pro homework cautious. right now. raining everyday thunderstorms. Still kinda humid really cool times too. Must waiting Moderna one. feel like money could better spent elsewhere research. approved emergency use that, lives lost. there’s reason experts would concerned cases.... lol PR stunt people falling thread What’s bad news? ask new norma crew. Anything data suggesting social distancing go least 2025? Ok keep waiting death-count climbs daily. bodies piling streets ready? Come man, pinnacle science. pharmaceutical company would release vaccine wasn’t safe. Anyone thinks otherwise conspiracy theorist. Dude feel that. I’ve itching get pit months There's huge disinformation campaign trying exacerbate everyone's concern virus.

I'm devastated spent time money Operation Warp Speed, spent time trying educate public it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  total meaning causes. currently around 60 million people die annually grandmother 88 living brooklyn, NY, want help sign vaccine soon available her. far understand, at-risk individuals phase 2 NY (phase 1 nursing homes + staff, ICU workers etc). anyone know something sign on, available yet? easier virus transfer, dangerous is. 

I knew COVID-19 gonna big problem soon learned could transmit sneezing/coughing. 

Totally different Ebola transmit via needle injections. Idk traditionally stopped anti-vaxxers past. Nope. anRN inlicensed 3 states, husband ER doc. Murder intentional too, obviously understand law either. assuming politicians care others. lyes another problem. Education tell us think, tells us think. alternate reality: “Pfizer CEO gets vaccinated live television REALLY PLACEBO?” mean worst comes worst 12 miles swimmable you’re probably taking JetSki back months away issue instead pre emptively squashing cost let grow fester. always works well. Way longer 20 years. continue rate currently would take around 700 years reach 1 billion deaths. Dang dude got him. bet 144hz frame monitor can't even tell difference 120hz. He's wasting much CPU he's probably BIGGEST idiot I've ever met. could anything say, literally anything, ever true? fucking idiot wasting cpu instructions dumbass shit. Fuck. really pisses can't trust idiots. mRNA made/destroyed body time. mRNA injected destroyed- doesn’t hang around causing long-term effects. 

Also, vaccine trials going, almost 3 months data point. Problems caused vaccines almost always seen first six weeks following injection. It’s reassuring trial 40k people virtually debilitating life-threatening events. record, study population 40,000 people bigger almost every vaccine market, exception rotavirus vaccine.

Everyone certainly entitled opinion, boils “I don’t want to” I’m never going change someone’s mind. I’m hoping take scariness away getting facts there, especially people don’t interact kinds discussions daily. risk damaged vaccine even negligible, get COVID likely pass someone else may young healthy. assuming politicians care. I’m young healthy. worst part working sick patients.  AWESOME idea. Oh hell yes, that's great news. dunno. could film video injected arm folks would say ""it's probably placebo"". agree there's tradeoff, rationale seems sound, accept it. depends virus mutates. Sucks dork wake fuck up.

Lapping mainstream media big pharma without second thought.

Sad. total meaning causes. currently around 60 million people die annually. Yeah, like said, think fair consider corners cut. 

And no, worried all, I'm chilling home. There's chance contract virus whatsoever. inpatient nurse, appreciate this. work directly covid patients like do. keep checking email schedule vaccination time. need people like prove safe. would mean one nurse doctor RRT gotten yet. I'm going get really pissed hear bunch people cutting line money connections. confident, even little confident like somewhat scetchy vaccines (as big farma, pfizer), exempted legal responsibility prerequisite release product. That's saying enough, thinks. think come time public schools add list required vaccinations, however, think come anytime soon.
 
The reason little test data persons younger teenagers. would stretch require vaccination young children data exists proves safety efficacy age group.
 
When data gathered analyzed, required. Start working resume. company doesn’t care health well-being, can’t imagine management bright either.  That's awesome. Nice see good hopeful news sub. clinical trial stage. Insightful agreed, bifurcation breeds confidence I'm going take vaccine available, definitely concerns vaccine, especially since around long enough get data specific scenarios. mRNA vaccines tested humans last months, one know long term side effects. data say safe not, even though long term effects traditional vaccines incredibly rare. also data mRNA vaccines affect pregnant women women planning becoming pregnant.

These real concerns brought normal antivaxx nuts. question testing. 

So understand remain largely asymptomatic contracting COVID-19, specific window positive contagious. 

My question is, contract COVID-19 day 1, tested day 2, test come back true positive? come back positive virus system longer? 
They finalized deal last month reserved vaccine chief U.S. country covid cases also happens one biggest countries world, population wise Maybe need re-education camps like China. Round anti vaxxers force vaccinate them. thank world later bodies stop piling streets. probably right. grumpy last night. Oh Jesus even consider side effects.

Again, still would rather die. Last heard US exercised second 100M purchase option Moderna supposed start delivery April.

Pfizer says orders past 100M committed countries, able sell additional US least June. Penn university developed it. Biontec licenced mRNA technology

Penn working 15-20 years biontec licenced spend whole 2 weeks inserting spike protein

So yes, USA put far funding it

Anyway thats beside point. stop calling skeptics? end result skepticism vaccines safe effective. climate science. 

Media call science doubters deniers. That's precisely nothing change next pandemic worse. You’re going get actual answer commenter. Seriously, coronavirus sub become anti-vax lmao Trust:

""firm belief reliability, truth, ability, strength someone something.""

Science:

""the intellectual practical activity encompassing systematic study structure behavior physical natural world observation experiment.""

I firm belief reliability systematic study physical world observation experiment. competition squashed expect good shareholders publicity stunt, Pfizer extremely corrupt.

They've 80 cases violations pay $4.5 Billion since 2000 ranked ""worst reputation"" top 17 pharmaceutical companies. That's easy fucking similar saying something like ""Police officers knew getting into"" people try kill them. said bet they'd gasp clutch pearls. source people use. 
As someone already mentionned, tried one gaiter look graph, precision neck gaiter data point poor (large incertitude), still way worse surgical mask even cotton mask. acute respiratory infection symptoms, go participating private (majority) government clinical get checked. $10 flat rate consultation, PCR test, medicine. positive, hospitalisation, follow tests, medications, etc free.

It certainly advisable public receive vaccine, refusing cannot limit Constitutionally protected rights law. Yep, every antimask person increasing chances new variant coming deadlier possibly undetectable vaccine. whole freedoms shit reason less chance return normal. FDA actually meeting approve EUA?

You’ve never seen vaccine go fast hasn’t happened life. first time it’s happened doesn’t mean isn’t done safely. happened quickly extreme amount funding resources scientists never normally have. 

If don’t think phase 4 trials relevant knowledge pharmaceutical clinical trials clearly lacking. 

FDA reviews still happened. happened quickly. know long paperwork normally takes? +90 vs 0? haven’t downvoted btw appreciate rolling fast possible (so say) 95% efficacy rate safe people immune-compromised, don’t see don’t allocate hundreds billions get enforce mandatory vaccinations. print money, letting hundreds thousands millions people die. pandemic. ways convert economy making food, basics vaccines.

You’re crazy I’ve gotta admire hustle. Diaper prepared this! Yes! Lets take vaccines! Drink it!!! Drink it!!!!!!! Probably year out. Many people don’t want first line don’t to. 

Experimental doesn’t mean unsafe, means hasn’t done explored. Since Pfizer’s vaccine first mRNA vax licensed US, I’d argue it’s far experimental vaccine. know double blind studies work, you?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* see many people talking vaccine ""the light end tunnel"". Could someone explain true? I've seen many interviews vaccine rolled reduce chances symptomatic response covid. Even vaccine, still carrier spread virus. already confirmed vaccine replace social distancing masking, many people acting like end covid? shit. government running it. They've months get shit together. absolutely defending them, saying small children recommended wear masks. mean think people flying maskless kids around fact? NO, baby young wear mask STAY FUCK HOME. entire point make people aware maks toddlers recommended. act like saying defense, defense, fact. someone two brain cells would know meant flying kid gets go spread germs. absolutely is. work HS, really sad. Except basically rejection words, far tell. believe Forbes article says mask baby would raise risk SIDS, yeah, could kill them. I'm tell bunch parents try see babies die, guess never really know. That's fair point. think problem right 2020 people care virus personally hit city. even maybe not. Absolutely. Yet still people sub saying going 2022 see normalcy. Australian vaccine hasn’t worked (or rather stopped developed due side effect) omg know nothing SIDS, please stop. SIDS care adult watching not. market, no, 30 years since research method started. risks known worked years. Ultimately, far safer vaccines given many different points throughout medical history.

Consider also vaccine one-off (or case, two-off, exceptions including needing boosters every often). Pharmaceutical drugs typically given taken regularly--weekly, daily, even multiple times day. leads buildup chemical bloodstream system maintain continuing take dose. effects extreme long term can't determined relatively short testing periods, imagine, constant stream something far larger impact body one two time injection would. 

Again, I'm scientist doctor, even basic understanding biology chemistry think safe assume medication currently take twice day every day life much higher chance causing long term side effect shot get twice. think comparison apples oranges situation really. I'm sure get qualifies. long term goal confidence wide spread vaccination current goal lives vulnerable. man interviews home, ICU nurses cant treat loved ones safety home. need protect people first, willing finally sufficient supply focus people ignore science, facts logic make choices based assumptions based people assigned value to, decide do. people put kids plane seat walk away either.

At point nearly good alternative getting everybody vaccinated. US average western country terms likelihood getting vaccine, that's said that. don’t spread grandma also anti-vax kill her. wouldn’t get it? So? Even get getting vaccine it'll much milder case would otherwise. Gtfoh shit good And, none u/erdlinke_94 said true, guy said true, 73M+ known infections worldwide, that's 730k+ dead already. awful enough Wow quick Canada ""I'm chef, eat food make"" I'm missing point. bad? sell stock news vaccin came out? missing? Also CEOs replaced. shuffle three years anyway. missed it, too, wooshed me?  key is: many daily deaths ok governors/officials, 2k, 1k, 500, etc lifting restrictions, 500 USA, went apeshit 50 back so... knows long term effects

As opposed COVID-19, host potential unknown long term effects? 

By mechanism could vaccine long-term effects? Honestly type people don’t trust vaccine science won’t trust even Rump sticks needle ass right front them. people don’t trust also don’t wear masks. Fu@k em all. Back line. know real vaccine butt juice? camera tell? 1% million big number 10-50% bigger. yes few. young fine relatively speaking. That's mean. there's real risk someone like ofc risk exists giving others

idk point comment start flame war Eh I’ll feel get vaccine.

Once at-risk family members receive it, I’ll feel relief. I’ve edge made sure send n95 kn95 masks. 

Once know they’re safe, I’ll still cautious, also won’t nearly anxiety. telling sending stimulus checks 70% America job loss good idea? really take political science class. wife’s then? God damn, access pass for, frankly, dumbass reasons blowing mind. agree partially. Although - point like run around underpants like kids. So, 1:1.

Although role-modeling important key compliance - kids difficult others. flown kids - getting comply something simple buckling seat (we always buckled up) take rough - struggle.

I also know kids much better teachers us. works teacher struggle parents. So, experience taught come high horse comes dealing kids. totally feel parents struggling kids compliance certain things. opinion - stubbornly keep it. may never know complete survival rate since (assuming number cases 4x higher known) 3.75% world population infected. anyone find sequence info it?

You're pretending every single person read walked away willing take vaccine. That's intellectually dishonest. possible, seem scientific community saying. 

That saying, actually. number cases suspected reinfection versus confirmed reinfections 60 1. includes suspected probable reinfections reported media. Washington Colorado reporting 300+ probable reinfections, there's reason believe states also reinfections. immune system magically change cross state lines. two year old wearing mask although easy make so.

Pfizer gonna make far money vaccine could ever lose something goes miss it. get flu shot every year. I'm anti-vaccine long shot. expect company interests heart. care vaccine, care profits it. massive financial incentive get many people take vaccine. 5 years makes people explode something, they'll plenty money pay ""business expenses"" ie lawsuits like.

This wikipedia, like I'm pulling info aunty facebook something. understand that's point, I'm confused know without long-term studies? Washington State University So.... Smallpox? [90% Canadians live within 100 miles US it’s offensive many actual Latinos Latinas. Doesn’t even make sense Spanish pronunciation true, restaurant/gym/sports/concerts thing decide may come back 100% early super late gradually, every country/state different, post festivities impact wildcard argument would stronger aware vaccine [known side There's lot think lawfully,. kind goes hand hand freedom speech, freedom belief. Yeah initial half dose things favour:

* Uses less vaccine. 100 million doses cover 66 million people, instead 50 million.
* less effective probably effective (but obviously confidence intervals quite wide)
* Estimated efficacy asymptomatic infections 58% vs 4% (not typo; 14.5 times effective)
* Fewer side effects (I'm sure listed results, led suspect first place)

Also hopefully mean time since week, cases accrued, lending confidence efficacy. Although still issue over-55s included. ahead fucking Florida. Florida hits 100k tests big ok buddy...guess Florida ‘big day’ every day least past two weeks. Spanish Flu. comparison ludicrous.

The vaccine pointless people 70. 1 2,000 chance dying 70 years old. 

Spanish Flu approximately 100 times deadly. 70 approximately 1 20 chance dying.

The people 70 benefit vaccine CEO's Pfizer extremely clinically vulnerable cold kill them. 

You statistically likely die flu 70 years old.

Source, website:  title sympathy, whole spiel really reflects people don’t care. kid images folding chairs tokens mark people died really powerful effective imo. Looks like I'm flying United get back flying. eyes, better marketing could done. watch this.

The rest choice. :)

Pass popcorn... Yeah agree you, CEO turning ostensibly optics cutting line bad look! words he's waiting see many people die vaccine. 1 50? reference back claim? hope grossly inaccurate seems. People die regardless... That's point. government care *now*? heard one single person even mention whether CEO Pfizer get vaccine first not. President others, yes. Him? No. really bad attempt PR, nothing more. He's caused news taking announcing took it, speak everyone would assume got it. Since product all. everyone thinking take vaccine build trust: instead saying get cut line, excuse, could say got vaccine. way tell. could even get ""something syringe"" live TV we'd never know got. good news april, won’t worry hospitals overflowing, life 99% back normal Like old drunk driving films. Never saw one, day. Unfortunately, covid deniers huge group, politician wants offend actual facts. deniers antivaxxers family; conversation one vaccinated kids yet. kept cool, scream *what fuck wrong guys* anything. open learning more, advised research childhood illnesses learn risks vaccinating were. kid little, excellent doctor whatever recommended, honestly know much vaccinations critical, why. know diseases crippling children relatively harmless adults. 

So many things changed since kid 60s. Like suddenly many people think doctors drug pushers science dangerously flawed. get vaccine covid develop CJD 10 years later? Call might entitled legal representation ads playing 20 years. yup 280,000 friday Remember probably 10-15% population infected thus amount natural immunity, also people 18 won’t eligible receive it. come from? wanna go bar get drunk. even drink. never said anti-vaxxer would swayed.  They're big transmission risk other. like states, like Massachusetts, putting prisoners early order.

Splitting hairs here, might operating old numbers. [2018 median life term remaining figure 2.2 years. depends country, mine kicked ass went back normal 3 months ago Ok chief explain cases would going places absolutely mitigation applied? posts claim thing works NPIs bring cases yet that’s happening places cases declining. know probably love lockdowns wish they’d last forever real world data showing don’t fucking matter much many sub wish did. sell every morning. Instacart know. sell giant rolls.

My point is, fixate toilet paper rather meds food? Oh, I'm saying RNs, CNAs, whatever trusted doctors researchers absolutely keep eye acceptance vaccine's safety adoption rate huge impact. suspicions already raised safety vaccine, CEO turning vaccination looks really bad. 

I'm science-leaning compliant come, pulled kids school 2 weeks first schools started shutting down, even gone grocery store 8+ months, called anti-maskers surgeon general CDC still counted among even admit doubt safety vaccine seeing CEO take it. two doses frees meaningless decision pass smell test all. normal since reopening school day care ~April (Norway). first parents wear masks. health officials recommend masks children age 12. negative unknown effects kids much greater threat disease. parent trust govt health experts. understand point marketing average consumer standpoint around new vaccine people may feel concerned about; developed faster every before; hurts confidence.

It's Obama others volunteering receive live tv. Seeing others trust science feel smarter privledged information builds confidence.  stop celebrating like end. Even vaccine can't stop wearing masks yet, still diligent, long time see herd immunity. looking seems country gonna faceripper, cause ""wise"" group imagine unwise apeshit group case eventually going get either live virus vaccine. 

And I'm risk group either. flu past, know flus suck know virus manifest worse flu people younger - fact co-worker mine. going believe - internet, seen eyes? It’s tad weird get high priority anyway. 

The average life span someone nursing home less year. also aren’t much transmission risk aren’t active overall community. am, 11% capacity ICU beds due COVID. Meanwhile, 30% juvenile cancer patients missed windows surgery lockdowns. lot doctors politicians jail. I'm curious efficacy duration protection. two-shot regimen provide longer better protection one shot? However - latest guidance FDA pregnant lactating women *the option* get vaccine US. 

The NY Times had[ good overview issue 

The TL;DR: Version there's nothing vaccine that's expected danger pregnant, lactating women babies. lack testing data. 

Personally, I'd probably wait delivered pregnant otherwise low risk profile COVID. lactating, I'd probably wait data showed testing support statement article: experts particularly enthusiastic prospect breastfeeding women might get vaccine. “The biologic plausibility risk harm infant breastfeeding extremely, extremely low,” Dr. Swamy time would take antigen — essential ingredient new vaccine — injected woman’s arm travel bloodstream breast milk, antigen would disintegrate.

Hopefully fairly quick testing shows true, lactating women choose getting vaccinated, breastfeeding. Except pregnant woman much ones need it, anything like flu. Flu causes increase misscariags. make sure plant manufacturing workers line. Same. Everybody else test dummies kids tuning watch fauci Yep, doubt compliance issue. Supply likely bottleneck. political, vaccine would approved October. 

Ironically, part reason able done quickly abysmal lack containment virus. Normally wait enough people group infected (or least control group, assuming could make 100% effective vaccine). happened quickly case virus widespread. found I'll Phase 1 2, dude. Skeptics educated. 

deniers hand....probably not. Secrecy good business. knew entire staff infected might want buy local. idiotic one wanted vaccine given patients already hospitalized? understand it’s preventative anything people already infected ICU admissions plateauing due increased local restrictions? due citizens changing behavior due increased case numbers? Maybe fill stands vaccinated frontline workers funny thing people tell hospitals overwhelmed ny. absolutely that's thousands died know vaccine prevent getting covid, right? basically tamiflu without proper testing riskier side effects. think we're disagreement here. also get GBS infected flu good reason keep shot Well vaccine now, need social distance masks anymore, err ever - Muh freedom!  /s astonishing people take single glance actual science produced

There ""actual science"" study long term effects, since literally long term. wonder vaccinated plasma would enough antibodies make difference. vaccine study I'm quite certain get placebo, I'd expect antibody titer lower convalescent plasma, though never know. things like affirmative action. Doesn’t show we’re different place country? programs like Trojan horse? think misread headline, gotten yet he's priority group, waiting turn like everyone else. available people, he'll get it. draw conclusions without evidence. make statement ""a vaccine does/doesn't X"" need able support assertion. basic stuff. pedantic economics *is* science, albeit abstraction culmination sciences. found variant zero symptoms humans spreads fast, infect everyone instead vaccinating? Anyone notice putting AA healthcare worker front cameras? Seems kind condescending AA community. Moving approval date going make supply vaccines suddenly increase, already produced stockpiled quickly possible, vast majority population literally impact. 

However, handful priority groups (especially frontline workers) might caught infection one week delay, make major difference. thousands get vaccine slightly earlier, give well-deserved peace-of-mind regardless whether would've infected timeframe. people saying people dismissed potential covid side effects said worse flu. They’re especially concerned rumored impact vaccine fertility pregnancy even though things also affected covid, actual documentation. frustrated. clearly read article. said would get would encourage others. 



So he's getting fucking vaccine. Jeez phrase ""I trust science"" fine cases, used imply something along lines one sentiments above, certainly concerning number people say almost quasi-religious sense. actually place trust scientific method, research &amp; development protocols, and/or evidence/results produced them, instead place implicit, non-evidence based trust anything told claimed developed scientist. big pharma good now? can’t keep 1st wave closely tied Chinese wild-type variant

What majority rest 44k? get virus analyzed? Vaccines start taking effect around day 10-14, seems confer good protection Got human mRNA vax passed trials?

Results Phase 3 clinical **trials** revealed Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna 90 percent effective. Therefor, pass **trials**.

Still think ""understand conversation"", muppet? COVID nurse cared 3 patients GSB, okay. many his/her patients saved deadly diseases vaccines take? least 10,000? Maybe more? Everyone agrees vaccines come risk, think risk worth taking vaccines ridiculous half-witted. It’s important cognizant risks vaccines, use tiny chance developing complications vaccine reason avoid par avoiding leaving house risks public accompany.

From CDC:

When increased risk, consistently range 1-2 additional GBS cases per million flu vaccine doses administered.

Studies suggest likely person get GBS getting flu vaccination. important keep mind severe illness death associated flu, getting vaccinated best way prevent flu infection complications.

I've spending maybe much time lately going around debunking blatant scaremongering... That's understandable issue comes people claiming anecdote evidence safety vaccine. point safety relative. Catching covid far dangerous potential side effects caused covid vaccine. choose path least consequence, mean either path completely safe.

Now please take vaccine stop feeding antivaxx crowd. also naive DONT WANT DISCUSSION WANT ACTION.

WHY ALLOWED HAPPENING. SOMEONE HELP US variant carries set mutations including N501Y mutation receptor binding motif Spike protein virus uses bind human ACE2 way confirm whether mutations contributing increased transmission. **There currently evidence variant (or studied date) impact disease severity, render vaccines less effective**, although questions require studies performed pace.  We provide updates investigations proceed. I'm focusing said trust vaccine trump claiming would election day, order try save votes. essentially said science confirms effectiveness take it. 

So full statement wrong. people take vaccine news outlet, that's news outlet, person fully quoted (which believe blame). not? really know anti-vaxxers think, you? true anti-vaxxer serious distrust authority figures, politicians, CEOs, even doctor. fact get giving fuel legitimize decision spread ideologies online (like facebook) get information from. mother fuckers mandated mask use, social distancing, contact tracing reduce getting bad first place.  16 17, then?

Not 16 17? there's nothing 17-4 vote worry you. that's science. due diligence analyse test drugs medical devices release level confidence expect major side effects side effects happen lower probability risk trying treat

**The Sweden Democrats'** group leader Henrik Vinge mainly emphasizes Commission places heavy clear responsibility government.

\- hope effect government takes hold situation shifts someone else says: responsibility regions, responsibility authorities. course, reason discuss actions actors well, Commission clear government controls country responsible. important establish that, says Henrik Vinge.

At practical level, sees important improve testing infection tracing also secure availability adequate protective equipment. Henrik Vinge also points Commission points lack language skills problem elderly care.

\- Elderly care used integration measure provide jobs new arrivals language confusion accepted. reduced opportunities give clear directives staff applies, says Henrik Vinge.

**Karin Rågsjö,** sits Riksdag's social committee Left Party, describes commission's criticism ""painful"".

Karin Rågsjö believes report shows regions municipalities also bear great responsibility.

\- protective equipment responsibility regions. also applies doctor's visits worked. deal covids housing responsibility municipality region.

**Based the** report, **Karin Rågsjö** concludes two things important solve urgently: firstly, access protective equipment, partly hourly employment transformed full-time care elderly. also believes crisis exposed Sweden must clearer national governance area.

Plus pharma companies huge interest burying negative news regarding it. I'll probably get eventually, definitely first line. worldwide flu deaths? US number isn’t anywhere near that. Better PR worldwide? No. Worldwide people rational concerned crooked politics vaccine distribution. Better PR far coronavirus sub thinks? Yes. you’re right mate. wasn’t saying mean want money. saying “can’t lose profit” like it’s obvious, logical statement. price went up! failure leadership since day 1. virus detectable around 4 days infection. 


By logic - contagious, means virus nose, test. contagious, detectable. (just logic - sure exact research says) epidemiological models answer question, say “there effectively impact case death rates several months”.

Don’t book can’t comply. normal times. MasksSkeptics subreddit banned filled totally debunked hoaxes banned anyone dared present scientific facts. Sad.. agree: issue. would willing accommodate reasonable requests. x reasonable view. help God keep steadfast, use it. Liar skepticism something crosses standard political divide

Happy Thanksgiving, please pass gravy. Trust loooool 😂 bro vaccine dude. going hurt you.

Damn anti vaxx anti science bullshit control  Would Captain’s decision boot makes decision? forever.  think people lot careful forever.  used wear masks social distance flu season, even though somewhere around 400k-650k people die every year regular flu. immediately administering hydroxychloroquine everyone back March April... oh, wait... subsequent studies showed wasn’t beneficial snd many people dangerous? don’t rush medicinal things want potential upside; carefully make sure safe beneficial. process usually takes years, don’t rush governments trying best protect citizens. It’s easy decision make Bad move. thought would look better ""not cutting line"", EVERYONE expects that's natural. Delaying vaccination make looks like trust vaccine.

As immunocompromised person (ulcerative colitis taking entyvio) expect able get vaccine (living Florida)? Inside unmasked, yes everyone concerned get tested week. Look I'm pro mask general medical advise saying put mask baby. give another link, point connect dots yourself. risk death baby one type fabric face (blanket, stuffed animal, shirt) then, yeah, another fabric face (mask) type risk. another link believe Maybe, come another time. 99% testing locations tested symptomatic people close contacts confirmed cases. fuck ton people around refuse test unfortunately refuse vaccinate. Anyway, huge amount unknown infections.  would make things better? Would ok killing people refuse take vaccine? problem that's easily solved. Right, totally get that. I’m saying we’ve achieved herd immunity summer, like he’s suggesting, would justification still distancing? Doesn’t herd immunity mean there’s risk spread? That’s what’s confusing me. Feels like we’re never going go back old life. selfish. Protocol defines cases symptomatic, similar vaccines. asymptomatic swabs done UK analysed separately. first links crazy claim, btw wasnt mask would kill recommended. research children buddy Ancient Aliens theorist say - ""Yes"" Exactly, doctor pandemic refuse vaccine said pandemic, deserve doctor, drop license go home. Worldometer reading please please please add vaccinated Column!!! think young people prioritized vaccines. completely disagree statement though:

'Stopping spread — — goal""

Herd immunity goal push hard get young people vaccinated spring, pushing hard get vulnerable vaccinated winter Lines drawn time. Society does. plenty anti vaxxers older age group. People free can't vaccinate everyone 70 wishes. Plenty won't. hope right. seem little odd we, yet, don’t seem seeing huge surge predicted thanksgiving. It’s bit two weeks, hitting now. simple. lot them. swear people traveling probably wouldn’t normal circumstances Yeah, kinda is. He's old enough knows everything say legit. came home telling teacher said reason he's tired mask reduces oxygen....no lady...its cuz he's 14 gets back go bed play video games. would expect people r/coronavirus informed go.

People really think it’s easy conclude h h novel disease half infected symptoms PCR tests haven’t even standardized yet. Ever done de novo genome assembly unknown virus design verify qPCR primer? would know shit takes time. already stated lots unknown disease handling assume h h. 

Also Taiwan again, didn’t shit, data also came Chinese. email “warning” thoroughly debunked. really think Taiwan independent research Wuhan?

Yeah WHO’s got problems early response COVID expected them. government already vaccinated million people emergency use three different local vaccines. experimental shots developed Sinovac Biotech state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group government supply agreements Western drug makers. drug-makers partnered private companies supply shots China.

China 🇨🇳 forced pay **reparations** West coronavirus, including free supplies vaccine. get vaccine state? want worldmeters start tallying many people vaccinated feel good watch numbers go instead bad. never said should.

I did, however, say equating SID seems mind occur without supervision adult precondition, probably load horse shit. Don’t blame America divided. Blame Republicans morons cult followers.  also understood include asymptomatic cases talked reducing asymptomatic cases press release, primary efficacy endpoints, read asymptomatic cases part primary endpoint. definition positive lab confirmed test, said nothing symptoms. Although press release written pretty poorly pretty unclear. understand it? I'm not. Bring on. hand, point time, people waiting vaccine available means efforts persuade people needed yet. people want wear mask, they're going without making lie.

Not mandatory. many places. you’re interested here’s paper 2016 topic. think it’s cool look far tech come since also vaccines existed first. walked covid vaccine could run People immune still spread it.
Besides, Santa beard masks won’t seal properly beard. need time machine. show tweets parents. know thats joke think people actually take.

He said assure kids Santa going house house christmas day wont spreading covid around killing grandparents. seeing year Fauci doubt would state rental santas immune.

Just anyone sees lol People days realise good everything is. current understanding diseases 1000 years ago, covid would wiped huge number people, that's MMR polio get us first. Clearly we've something right.

Anti-vaxxers dangerous people Russia hated Europe. still remember Russians Ukraine. mention assasinations UK attempt Nawalny's life. Hard trust state run mobsters.  I’m pretty sure person troll Fucking this. LOL people idea gps tracking even works. People don’t even keep location services phone drains battery yet government developed gps tech constantly monitor location without battery needing recharge, device fit needle. laughing? dont google maskwearing children two under, first 10 articles including say thing. Smaller children masks, fact. doesnt mean think airplanes. daughter worn facemask entire pandemic going 3-4, younger would keep home instead able go grocery store every months country deserves vaccine, it’s USA. can’t even vote guy whose entire thing universal healthcare pandemic. don’t help way whatsoever screw rest planet process. Heh whole city, spread population 300 million. comment project false sense fear. point one infected person infects less one person come contact nationwide numbers start dropping like rock.

People smarter explain way better, however many months takes number hit local peak infections roughly long takes get closer normal. 

That people wrong thing really hurting us, even vaccine comes out. take much longer virus work way population.

Just stay safe, patient, least see light end tunnel instead tunnel. Russia Putin oligarchs well earned hate distrust gets. ""easily"" Measles 93% effective

Mumps 88% effective

Rubella 97% effective

That's vaccines work. One person 5% chance getting virus nothing sneeze at. community people 5% chance getting virus orders magnitudes effective. Torn one. 3 year olds local daycare wear masks, 2 year olds. I’m quite skeptical could make 24 month old keep mask on. "" Berry retiring January, ..""

Said redditor probably never built shelter scratch, never made fire nothing, never created weapons traps hunted harvested food. Lmao last day wilderness, let alone *forever* pecking order states applies vaccine distributed states Feds.  read correctly, nothing stop rich guys doctors drug stores go directly Pfizer Moderna order case vaccine, want. would also result states higher levels seroprevalance getting vaccines earlier exactly want avoid understand zones. We're zone, point. spread already control. both. Herd immunity way gets solved, whether vaccine getting it. Obviously former better, we're gonna reach point people vaccinated immune infection another month so, longer. pretty stupid 8 year olds then. ""Didn't already buy people out?""

 Bezos probably came mind said biggest plate ever watch history channel doomed believe ancient aliens. don’t learn doom destined repeat history. Fuck Brexit twats voted it,the EU perfect far better it,but Tory's bellends lead English trump yeah,sooner Scotland leaves behind better. don’t believe 20 percent US population tested positive? imagine must stressful experience -- family best wishes! making vaccine speculative.

The governments want vaccine, want companies produce even approved. They're barely willing pay cost (and companies willing sell greater good.) there's fucking way they're going spend money, government gives nothing work out. That's fair.

It would fair companies selling vials several thousand dollars each. they're not. They're selling cost good faith. means government needs pay efforts good faith. didnt say animal died it. yes, strand new, making *not thing,* hence said *covid*, *coronavirus*. Goddamn anyone wants reddit fight everyone else. read properly.

“ scared unmasked three year old suggest stay home.”

So ignore basic science says children spread disease easily adults. Internet arguing masks resent fact people think spawn fussy illustrative bad parenting? 

The irony real. Maybe shouldn’t fly children shouldn’t either. different doses seems batch made Italy. Earlier year first batch, sure batch concentrated, told regulators give slightly less doses. sure got passed raised concerns batch good vaccination. Source BBC panorama show aired 14th Dec Oxford team. watch 1 hour show informative.

Also source Pfizer Moderna shows recorded symptomatic cases? seems unusual monitor volunteers closely like Oxford/AstraZeneca trial test weekly. Gettin' little big britches, Mr. Bezos. Last heard (about week ago), US, officially decided exactly gets vaccine second round. essential workers definitely discussion. I’m pro vaxx hate anti vaxxers. I’m taking vaccine. rushed thing don’t clue long term implications. don’t trust least. It’s like haven’t many drugs past deemed “safe” discover years later causes serious health issues birth defects. don’t think it’s smart jump get this

Edit add... know downvote oblivion goes everyone wants hear think seriously. It’s proven safe long run past months. fully grasp shitty Covid don’t get everyone eager lab rats LOL. complaints lol. mean, see anywhere link suggests comparable. kid 3, wife work home. kindergarten closed work maybe 50% day. crazy close parents go out.

My friend works shop (not essential) boss said come work customers. wife cannot work all. Maybe 2, 3 hour day that's stretching supermom level.

When leave kids home entire work force work home affected, services products create. Thank thoughtful reply. trying save face, first response defensive (for lack better word). perceived ""additional context"" added counter OP's point vaccine novel thus worthy caution. 

It appears that's case, goes show I've argued enough people reddit today need take step back.

Thanks again, sorry seemingly dismissive. soon vaccine gets past phase 1b guarantee restrictions rolled back regardless experts say. Summer 2021 make social end pandemic. That’s fault leaving house. Wouldn’t better PR move take vaccine convince public it’s safe? Rekt lmao Last December went football game state... found Browns fans passed around handle fireball gone. want back. able get shitfaced, high five, cheer, hug complete strangers sheer joy magical moment. I’ve set aside $1000 I’m thankful good financial position pandemic, know it’s dumb wasteful fully intend buying round everyone favorite bar go again. forgot add point go 1,000 cases two weeks... already scrambling find room COVID patients. cAnT wIn MaTtEr WhAt! 😭😭😭 voting people believe science. interesting consistent read til now. link studies? Idk, usually trust Fauci’s word sounds bit overly optimistic anti-vaxxers thing university literally let take 4 years. easy anymore 😆 got home loan September without seeing anyone person think interesting question threshold adding simple restriction mask mandate public areas. know one 61k flu deaths covid said 74x that. many multiples 2-73x magic number? 2x 100k deaths sounds like lot think worth law wear masks for. know Bird Flu heard first Polio vaccine actually kill people low immune systems. MS, pretty concerned taking first vaccine. mean shit, look college football games SEC.

These yokels already without masks. true. winning people convinced paranoid.

""It easier fool someone convince them."" -Churchhill realize boot licker big pharma right? fucking stupid you, skeptical actually think understand history corrupt companies. statement never truer right now.

I'm 30, parents 64, one grandparent left 96. 

My grandma told stories kid great depression, dust bowl, viruses like mumps, measels, polio, even spanish flu, lost older siblings it, well relatives. 

Even years COVID, shared stories warning unforgiving aggressive viruses parents everyone immediately jumped joy opportunity vaccinate PROTECT children.

Now, large generational gap, lot new parents, even age younger get conversations. one recent life system deal it, learned history books online. Thus drew conclusions, can't fathom viruses ever existed. 

Then....here are. mention Gov DeWine (Ohio) said making numbers public COVID19 dashboard department health website. Head r/covidlonghaulers start counting decent parenting, right there. Many enjoy soul crushing commute. Way cut line there, Fauci! /s believe also one oldest, oldest population Europe Sad dude thinks virus hoax ICU bed someone takes virus serious got unlucky find alternative solution. ""A Pfizer spokeswoman said email CNN Business sale took place Pfizer shares hit predetermined price part plan authorized Bourla August 19.""

How fix happen again? ""Unlike Moderna’s Pfizer’s vaccines, based messenger RNA, Brilife vector-based. vaccine takes vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genetically engineers express spike protein novel coronavirus envelope. injected, cause disease itself; VSV infect humans. Instead, body recognizes spike protein expressed envelope begins develop immunological response."" Meanwhile, entire state, well beginning gone completely hell.

There refrigerated trucks provide extra morgue space city live two close metro areas. Hospitals trying send patients room hospitals, room either. Schools going 100% online, mandates (because any) run teachers staff. last week's press conference, seriously doctor give handwashing lessons. health department issued stay safe Ohio protocol - really recommendation rules, right? first stay safe item ""stay home"", DeWine responded question restaurants saying a-ok go restaurants long sit family.

The thing remotely considered safety measure issued 10pm 5am curfew - ton exceptions. ok professional sports games, spectators, nightly walk around neighborhood 11-12 rules. (Still going, get exercise little risk running anyone else.)

It's pretty much every person now, I'm little bit bitter. Glad we're starting vaccinate, things shit Ohio, getting worse, sending signal turning corner going horrible affects. Cya 🤗 No. dry runs home. older one got little one followed. played knows mask means ""fun"". put mask go park, store etc. He's wanting see side effects first lol Operating Engineer hospital.

The hospital work maybe 20 ""ACTUAL"" isolation rooms. dedicated exhaust fans kept negative. 6 located areas keeping COVID patients also needed non-COVID patients.

There maybe total 40 ICU patient rooms. terminal box reduce airflow ""kind of"" make rooms negative enough put COVID patients.

This good sized hospital county 1,000 cases past two weeks. get told family could setup field hospitals run room.

Meanwhile sister nurse hospital plenty overtime available lack nurses cover current capacity hospital. known now. guy isn’t dumb. isn’t going one first take it. club? business gone business dumb. friend works nurse CA says excess ICU patients handled comfort care... doctors? arguing, genuinely curious. know, right? could care less. time Fourth July blow I’m going throw! Already planning firework show Bye sort rubbish news article that? 47 people infected covid given vaccine not? 

Simply construction workers going overseas given vaccine mean construction workers found working overseas given vaccine. 

The way article written mixes two things together create impression 47 people tested positive covid given vaccine. Let's make winter, people. Get vaccinated , part spring VICTORy! idiot yell team deliver more. usually corners end cut. It’s quite achievement manager scale up, more, sacrifice quality safety. requires quite balancing act. course. Straight politics aloud subreddit, fine, alot important facts can't dicsuss rule. mask today save lives vulnerable, family, own. parents 61 62 health issues, including heart condition, qualify ""at risk"". I'm convinced though parents would need hospitalization tough time got COVID. fact think spread still matters vulnerable vaccinated people life qualify vulnerable obese health conditions identified risk. pretty unhealthy qualify risk. Warmer weather probably huge benefit president shouldn’t get vaccine. fucked much. rather risk taking vaccine even CEO scared taking ""uncomfortable"" couple weeks? Homie seeing many zombies get first. two things related beyond me, right sorry attempt digging dirt! BioNTech scientists created it. want elementary school teacher anymore home two kids remote learning. It’s almost like non-shitty weather time year helps DON’T get? Lol course will. 

No masks, it’s flu, get it... best health care available man given immediately...and bullshit.  given vaccine first

Fuck everyone else... usual. 

These people SCUM earth. Isn’t ends happening anyway? would get caught? gets virus later claim one 5-10% vaccine work. Don’t need vaccine it, solved covid It’s science, it’s image vaccine. matter wonderful vaccine is, won’t anything half population refuses take it. important take possible steps increase trust vaccine. CEO take one vaccine may influence lot people take otherwise wouldn’t, least contribute change heart. people think one guy getting persuasive 40,000 subject clinical trial. Smdh. parts well ? There's second vaccine due approved December ends, yes, think I'll get later April. still think we'll almost back normal then, like maybe stadiums concerts still otherwise masks do. herd immunity gold standard. someone community gets measles, nobody try avoid it, mask usage, quarantining, spreads 0 - 2 new people eventually odds catch it, everyone gets better lineage ends automatically. course that's goal, today, kind near-herd immunity would tolerable. say vaccinate 35% 20% naturally immune (have beaten COVID), suppose cases would trickling decent mask use, hospitals could heavy use 30% empty stable. yeah that's terrible ongoing status quo far cry better today. 

Officially, 5% US immune COVID already, think numbers low. Millions us caught tested. isn’t person made it. CEO entirely replaceable. Sure, needs better framework place. start thinking bolstering powers CDC. Thinking splitting healthcare organizations politics one elected official appoint essentially control everything.

There vote. talking about? six states better. using alternative math? describe Operation Warp Speed anything speed development production Pfizer vaccine? far aware Warp Speed provide funding program. government funding came way German government directed Pfizer's partner vaccine's development, BioNTech. I'm saying Operation Warp Speed bad, think US taking credit something hand creating. Operation Warp Speed provided guaranteed orders Pfizer vaccine. care hard kid. 2 year old spread virus. End story. Seeing headlines makes tear up, knowing actually end 2021. everyone like champ almost whole world much much better America. Korea less 20 new cases per million. America 600. 
It’s even bloody close dude  Thanks! Yeah use heart’s content, worries cares spread. common cold gets spread millions years nobody cares. matters prevent vulnerable people getting it. know works best? Yes vaccinating exactly group like also already flu every year. Ideally everyone gets vaccine end. prioritise people highest chance dying virus first. 7th lowest. 17th.  agree, taking vaccine pushes 1 person line, might give many little nudge need trust vaccine oh New Normal crew gonna hate this..lol! That's concerning all...  society never force kid anything want do. Even kid 35 year old lives home parents' basement.  fair, taking vaccine obvious move point. day churned millions taking one vaccine wouldn’t really affect much. fact, may influence people get vaccinated. 40-50% people don’t want get vaccine, sure least hundred may likely take vaccine guy doesn’t. Therefore CEO using 1 vaccine way good harm. hospital husband works staff tested weekly People also take another summer sitting butts too. sub absolutely anti-science. 

I’m literally talking someone incorrect something (asymptomatic spread) attacking scientific body dared truthful accurate science surrounding thing he’s wrong about. 

A majority also wrong fact use attack scientific organizations. 

This definition anti-science. everyone died lied got caught it, would absolute PR disaster. Better transparent give BS excuse didn't, people like lose trust. It’s interesting note Florida’s success late, state largely open, including likes theme parks, bars indoor dining. Germany often same. People working hospitals care homes supposed tested 'regularly', well mean every 6-8 weeks even longer apart (there course institutions test week even often, seem norm). 
The lack testing health care workers one main reasons areas see bad outbreaks within hospitals nursing homes (those articles often dress personal risk workers, think that's really smaller problem here...). 1% 300 Million 3 Million. Example: get car accident and, can't get ICU 4 others die, end losing leg. Sure, people present investigate whatever hypotheses like good luck them. free requirement rigorously justify claims make (the linked article certainly meet requirement); 'but science!' preclude recognition politics ideologies underlying claims offering critique. New York Times publish em don’t worry CNN while. father passed away almost year nursing home, back 2011. can't imagine able see went. would wrecked me. want go party politics point Swedish people could vote party prioritized health care still stands. like US 2 options bad. Video games cause violence. spread viruses. No, worry. We're gonna need many people vaccinated possible able reach herd immunity return normal. Getting away NYC, get special part NY. hardcore antivaxxers ever met Rome, NY extra layer crazy religious top that. referring to? None confirmed. understanding far likely people continuing test positive prolonged period time vs. getting reinfected. “you taste first” attitude pharmaceutical product went large scale clinical trials ridiculous me. Whether takes doesn’t mean anything. medical background veterinarian, doesn’t know safety vaccine FDA. honestly matter. conspiracy theorist find reason mistrust matter does. Can't convince people live world. 'patriotism become meaningless country'

you right tell stupid take sis. lmfaoooo   CPA, finding new job easy talking people want cautious.

Quite opposite. cautious person would want get many people vaccinated soon possible. (Unsure ur url means but) yeah....this really brought worst I’ve lost much respect people judgmentalism knows bounds. (You argue hypocritical idk) needs take vaccine....the vaccine isnt scarce moral outrage ""cutting line"". would help actually take product pushing hundreds millions people. one cases needs get high supply Super sus. Seconded. babble something equally scary useless every week stay headlines. said, many professions healthcare sector dominated women, claim disrespectful them. Many nurses died fighting covid. Oh must mistyped said - 'even pregnant people (against medical advice)'. 

Oh wait - didn't. dork.

Nice strawman, tho. personal risk may low, multiply risk hundreds millions people going get vaccine want resume normal lives. Guarantee going keep spreading virus. Whereas even everyone wear mask time could bring virus close elimination. fucks sake, explain then! Look argue main point trust science front line scientists. optics CEO probably day day involvement creation/testing literally changes nothing logical stand point. vaccine world wide effort scientists world. CEO grand scheme things little fish. think savings dorm compare tuition long term yes, right enough everyone. there's even enough front line seniors homes, aka people intents purposes ""Forced"" take one. gets groups basically optional yeah, ex presidents take shots cam, older movie stars, etc etc need publicity get demand match supply saying little dirt eating devils spread viruses. Whoa I'm pretty sure tell get vaccine covid covid symptoms recently... means second dose get covid inbetween interesting conundrum. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco vow enforce state’s ""new"" coronavirus restrictions December 4, calling Governor Gavin Newsom’s efforts contain pandemic business closures stay-at-home orders “flat ridiculous”? Best case: April 2021 
Middle case: August 2021 
Bad case: December 2021 
Worst case: ? ? ? One teacher day would hell high school. level education, specialized. guarantee understanding physics/chemistry/calculus advanced many older non-science teachers would long since ever math science class. Ahamdulillah source bizarrely popular conspiracy theory vaccine infertility agent. lot conspiracy theories leave vaccines typically tested pregnant women, least early stages. pretty rare test anything pregnant women, people sensitive babies, especially ethics committees lawyers.

With sheer volume people set get vaccine United States alone- 100,000,000 end February, hopefully- near certainty relatively large number women get vaccine going get pregnant within next months. Hopefully we'll hear that, hopefully another chip misinformation vaccine increase popularity among general population.

Of course, there's also going people get vaccine, tragically miscarriage. like people get vaccine develop Bell's Palsy. pretty difficult say vaccine causing anything like that, compare frequency general unvaccinnated population, even stigma certain percentage vaccinated persons possibly unrelated health issues going difficult even impossible overcome large number people. Hopefully enough people worried unproven possibilities avoid vaccine. wife going try baby next year. idea vaccine alters fertility? That’s possible side effect scares right. According Sweden's comparable Denmark figure 24%.

Hard find comparable figures Belgium though.

Also hard find comparable data average household size perhaps relevant figure increased immigration.

Started go rabbit hole would comparable areas population densities got frustrated. Perhaps I'll instead join ""no country compared EVER"" -group. Especially celebrities world leaders spread misinformation it. cool enough. I'm sorry one break you. 8? Amateur! Going 17 2 months. Yes should

No brainer imo  That's keep saying people acting like goddamn munchkins witch east died. Singing ding dong witch dead, there's still half population thinks hoax. Every time thing passes, could mutate something worse now. really need everyone stay closed homes significant portion population gets vaccine. I'd go far keep quarantine refuse get without kind legitimate medical condition. essential position? get paid millions. Honestly, made people skeptical charlatan.

It said look verification efficacy first, blind faith.  Yup cause vaccine trials focused symptoms. literally zero testing vaccines stop people asymptomatic carriers. 

But guess we're find out... tried stopping ach payment? LOL almost impossible sometimes takes months. Bon Jovi's ""Living prayer"" couldnt applicable times maskholes griping FrEeDumBz. That’s outbreak going linger longer really needs to. 

Not everyone going immune getting vaccine, fucking everyone going run things haven’t able year. y’all fuckers getting virus way. Could imagine Trump Biden took together time, camera? known coronavirus, fact remains still vaccine developed fast. normal reservations especially seeing articles employers want vaccine mandatory blah blah PR stunts Bush, Obama guy taking vaccine live TV. would vaccine safe require much convincing coercion. results speak safe ex president taking You’re immunity eventually disappear it’s hard argue stupid. sick weak laid waste, shall herd immunity! ☠️ taking vaccine cutting line covid testing imo Exactly. sad thing ""pandemic already vaccines here. safe now."" 😣 keep living like shut ins when..? It’s 9 months since I’ve actually lived man, obviously person feels like time slipping by. long going keep know history sure, fox news, conservative talk radio pumping veins 24x7. Why? Because, like 95% world sat around nothing cases started spiking. knew population risk limited capacity hospitals first wave yet chose take action late 🤦‍♀️(and no, closing things 10pm shit) sure downloaded. Vaccines often take 4 8 years develop measure long term side effects. fact vaccine development less year little worrying. Tl;dr might able distribute vaccines 21st, former FDA head says it’s nursing homes needed residents consent vaccinated

Just administration dumb shit usual, ugh interesting. say months takes hit peak, mean everyday cases climb another day added time length? e.g peaked november beat peak every day december, etc.? Lose - Lose? so? Taking shows confidence work. surprising, mean exception made pregnant people comes mandating vaccinations. 

If look posts, people conflating news emergency vaccines anti-vaxxers. anti-vax message. Simply fact data pregnant people. However, many people verbally attacking pregnant people assumption they're anti-vaxxers. Even though official medical guidance wait. think net/net statement was. think made people *more likely* get vaccine *less likely* get vaccine.

Be honest. surprise. Estimates number deaths nursing homes hovered 30-40% much pandemic. 

Makes feel angry chosen ""shoot now, aim later"" approach throughout entire ordeal. Lives livelihoods could saved funneling aid towards really needed it. paramount nursing homes/patients. Sweden got bad batch swine flu vaccine caused young people develope narkolepsi.
Frankly feel well within rights question vaccine rushed also one held liable potential side effects.
If Covid-19 deadly Spanish flu would less issue taking lets Frank here, comparable. much mental strain, accidentally sex bunch men. Whoops. Yea one trust government. That’s peoples fault it’s governments. Nice victim blaming though. Gonna look guy limping next White House meeting you’ll find man. Fauci ever prove got vaccine people get? prove anything. Guaranteed order volume regardless vaccine turns work not, well strings attached research funding made rapid vaccine development time-line possible. Conservative media reason. Misinformation, hyperpartisanization, rage boners 24x7. Social media outlet parrot back sound smart. People say anything. guarantee already took sucks. There's old saying like bit better.

""if try pleasing everyone, end pleasing one"" rule 2 older babies. give cold? flu? give couple centuries. figure pandemic thing eventually. Conservative media. Profiting making stupid people feel smart woke expense everything. Science denying?

You realize covid vaccine tested pregnant people official medical guidance wait? suggesting pregnant people get fired jobs? UV? tanning pc?  company share information without violating HIPAA? probably added instill fear. understand people think kids exempt wearing one, especially spread virus easily adults.

That appear true, 40,000-person study found children 15 half likely adults infected, half likely adults transmit virus others. Almost coronavirus transmissions children came *for unknown fraction people.

I extremely worried long-term effects continue everything get sick. However, really know prevalent really effects are--just nobody experiences them. Yeah, it'll go people take it, people realize safe, becomes normal thing. like nobody wearing mask beginning pandemic weird one it. There'll still loud assholes, take it. Fuck bezos, act like funding comply. way optimistic. think early 2023 would accurate. Since double vaccination, I'm concerned people may become negligent either forget take second one justify one shot enough refuse second

What happen then? secondary shot first surplus second shot low shortage first shots available. 

Unlikely get covid still chance. Seeing unorganized Country handled covid, guess millions vaccines wasted. 1 shot never come back, enjoy outdoor, come back positive cause take second. i.e. 1/3 deaths linked nursing homes. 
My uncle died COVID home.   
2 years ago dad's doctor told him, home last resort, want go there.  anti vaxer definition, however time intention getting vaccine. one year now, might change bank texted ""Closed person banking services lockdown restrictions lifted"". any. Think let cat bag... NC unsafe pregnant women. vaccines tested pregnant wen standard operating procedure. touch back said earlier ""we make judgement data acquired"", feel much way. personally feel confident amount data acquired thus far. studies particular able point swayed feel confident do? 

On personal note I'd fall ""protected group"" ""quasi-protected group"" (breastfeeding). I'd get it, regardless...so unfortunately means months months quarantining. assignment? 

sure i'll [help](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=flu+deaths+versus+covid) work frontline workers suspicious vaccine, despite working daily vulnerable population.

There red flags raised questions need answers people confident vaccine others. 

The amount people see skipping take not-so-subtle wink MIGHT safe damned high.

I personally find little suspect really want to. US back bombing countries time!! hate realist.

Last one warehouses turn lights! Canada did. Buy enough donate surplus 3rd world countries. That’s rational people would think. right now, priority convince *irrational* people trust vaccine.

I suspect means restrictions eased gradually rather once. also think leaving door open able respond reality ground late next year. things looking great, restrictions eased earlier quickly hospitals still struggling. Maybe areas reach herd immunity much earlier others, maybe virus drop quickly spring next year, maybe things become catastrophic begin improve. many different things could happen really can't give hard fast answer.

So wait ""starting"" curb procedures?! Hopefully they've operating differently months curbing well Thanksgiving. hospital Florida stop ICU capacity drops 20 percent. herd immunity thing now? quit following awhile ago last remember didn’t think herd immunity would work. new research something? Google extended time many employees work remotely amid coronavirus pandemic, time saying work home September.

The company also testing hybrid workplace model may adopt it’s safe return offices, employees company spaces least three “collaboration days” week otherwise remote, Google said Monday New York Times reported work-from-home extension pilot workplace plan.
The Mountain View digital-advertising giant confirmed CEO Sundar Pichai told employees message Google testing whether hybrid model would “lead greater productivity, collaboration, well-being.”

The message said although companies similar size gone fully hybrid model, starting test it. 

Google July said would allow employees work home June 2021, earlier saying could work remotely till end year.

Under hybrid model, Google would allow workers book collaboration spaces indoors outdoors would offer reservable desks offices employees needing quiet space outside home.

San Francisco social media firm Twitter said May employees whose jobs allow remote work could continue working home “forever.”  Also May, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said next five 10 years, half social media titan’s employees could working remotely. exact answer either. want point people already positive covid far enough along show symptoms test positive could get vaccine test positive days later. Additionally vaccine period fully effective. lastly, conflicting studies effectiveness first ranging 50-85% effectiveness seen.

We expect number covid positive people vaccinated first weeks. Knowing important can't assume vaccine caused work. tough one... wait line big wig takes early shows confidence product. want unpause Tinder profile. sort priority states get vaccine? States running ICU beds receiving vaccines states still ok now. started going shortly mask mandate implemented. Crazy right? Masks work!? also killing lot people 5 20-40. think would much different reaction kids young adults dying rate elderly are. Three close friends turned 40 pandemic.

We live country. part crowd seriously quarantined. Needless say, none us able party together way planned, year ago.

As soon over, we're traveling *somewhere* partying like crazy. Even us 41 then, we're going *proper* 40th celebration, Death Youth party goth outfits tombstones drinking cake and, best all, best friends. Hell, far I'm concerned, 2020 lost year we're still 39! 

Anyway, really long way letting know ok feel way do, also another day. remember celebration friends family--and *can* delay that, decide so.   get insurance vaccine available immediately unless healthcare worker elderly. 

You get whenever becomes available demographic, likely mid 2021. Poor guy, must devastating staying home, getting paid nothing watching Netflix. hope recover that, together. think healthcare workers elderly risk prioritized regards actually getting vaccine limited quantity. virus kills less .01%. Yes ready done mess anything help us get welcome. due diligence. yet see credible data dangerous infants. sources? comment section paranoia fest using sanitize rooms still got sick Spring welp. magnanimous Anchorage four.  sounds hard. Good luck! Fingers crossed getting married seeing family ASAP. act like that, would definitely lie claim holding orgies care homes etc. I'm really torn getting vaccine immediately, trusting everything kosher vaccine development waiting v2.0 bugs (if any) worked :/ He's waiting see rest us go convulsions get vaccinated.

If nothing happens us peasants, he's board taking vaccine. point is? Rational level skepticism left discussion anti-vax flat Earth types. I'm going win words, please consider allowing mental rot infiltrate rest us. vaccine surely scarce enough CEO can't get show confidence it.

This nonsense. 

A nursing home worker contact hundreds people getting vaccinated impactful 10 random rich dudes getting it. believes life, child's life... matter. Anti-Maskers, often particular political persuasion often anti-maskers, renown complete total lack empathy others.

They care virus killed 3 Billion people - long believe they, themselves, suffer... care. Besides, since WH staff infected already, akin closing barn door horse gone? State health departments will. work one. comment needs way higher, especially comment it’s responding to

‘Build trust’ argument makes sense certain point. Like UK, Queen Prime Minister get It, that’s don’t need see anyone else jump line bullshit building trust, let people need get access Look [Cytokine Especially related Spanish Flu back 1918. 

In cases, body’s immune system went “overdrive” actually killed people. Bad time need cancer test circulatory testing. ICU bed set gym? bad take. Vaccines aren’t 100% effective, especially people weak immune systems. Let's see actually follow through, could empty words like wanting stimulus bigger 2.2 trillion already took fake vaccine actually works one shipping fake tells everyone hasn’t taken it

Did right? got already good press they’re saying he’d rather wait.  mean CDC's lack strength byproduct voted politicians believing / valuing science? found Toronto District School Board said voluntary testing program Thorncliffe Park Public School far uncovered 19 positive cases – **18 children** one staff member – and, result, school temporarily **closed 14 classes 42**. means **one two positive cases class**, opposed one large cluster.  unclear infections transmitted school neighbourhood, seen large number COVID-19 cases. elementary school, northeast city’s downtown, minutes away cluster high-rise apartment buildings, large racialized population mainly South Asian countries.

To me, far likely kids getting sick community, spreading much school. everyone got tested though, voluntary.

Why ever talk clusters? think countries means obtain statistics clusters (outside anecdotes case studies) also ones Covid situation control. effective contact tracing, maybe mandatory reporting. schools re-opened, little community spread countries, much data analyze schools. countries never really got things control re-opened schools economic political reasons, cases everywhere inside outside schools, unable make students wear masks, unable collect data contact tracing figure students spreading getting infected home, restaurants, parties etc. Cutting line take vaccine help world. actually hurt takes vaccine away someone needs more.  He's cutting line? even Pfizer CEO politicians getting vaccine ahead others. Oof surgical mask underneath n95 kinda hurts Maybe, came lied, would *really* look like trust believe product. nationwide hard lockdown would never able enforced. Lockdowns stupid anyway. Don’t smart ass know mean mean.... kinda suspicious It’s possible clinical trials always matter statistics end, technically never prove anything, spit probabilities. It’s extraordinarily unlikely happened random chance. Somebody knowledge stats could give actual probability. 

Think random pseudorandom things life: local raffles, called jury duty, etc. name came 8 times neighbor 162 times time period, It’s possible you’re extraordinarily (un)lucky people would getting awfully suspicious non random intervention causing difference point. America bad

lol okay think money social welfare system comes from? Money printer going brrr? long anti vaxx anti humanity attitude
And good riddens think CEO made vaccine? Lockdowns work. problem lockdown ends, even phases, far many people eagerly return past social behaviors stop caring much social distancing, washing hands, wearing masks, etc. many places throughout U.S. lockdowns even restrictions worked well far many people decide ignore (i.e. feel happen them, rights freedoms fire, etc.) even politicians members law enforcement undermine refuse enforce rules. also mass transit systems managed well stop spread. pointed going get downvoted saying someone wearing mask incorrectly. ever thing subreddit?

Unless work billing accounting, feel free quit let work pile up. ;-) Yeah good point. He's frontline exposed many infected/potentially infected people way healthcare workers professions are.

Yeah, harmful wrong. helped spread lot denialist rhetoric back Sept. Oct. ""look Sweden, reached herd immunity"" frequent refrain based basically evidence.

Roughly like Dakotas couple months ago.

I live SF thought poorly recently (daily cases gone 10x past 8 9 weeks, might still rise further), we’re posting pretty much lowest per-capita numbers state. Scary. guy always changing mind Let's please remember Pfizer shitty company way overprices drugs poor barely afford them. Please treat like good people, not.


BioNTech ones made vaccine. Praise them. Jawohl I'm sorry site rife ad links stuff blocks content. Trying leave page kept putting back list articles.

I seen that. I've seen kids wrapped scarves well. rhetorical question demonstrating silliness line arguing here.

It is, essentially... ""DO EVER COVER INFANT'S MOUTH EVEN SECOND FABRIC""

At rate, tilting windmills seems. fun elsewhere. :) you’re sick sure. want times, absolutely 100% not. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine mRNA vaccine. *is* brand-new kind vaccine.  bring places sensibly locked provided financial support people could afford locked down?  Yup, tons. nurses. [Doctors, No, long term studies time short term studies cool. galaxybrain.jpeg makes sense all....the vaccine doesnt even contain virus. body isnt going spontaneously create virus own. concerned wife getting covid logically best solution would many people possible around vaccinated...the risky thing seems get vaccine. Yikes. order backlog 520 million vaccines. One vaccines makes difference. 

One vaccine absolutely makes difference given frontline healthcare worker encounters tons people every day. might doubts big chunk thread does. 

Anti-vaxxers going swayed word pharmaceutical executive believe data. think unreasonable doubts.

It is. 

 History proven us big pharma trusted blindly.

This literally trusting pharmaceutical CEO data. love take word it

I trust science. word pharmaceutical ceo agree want true, hope people service industry support need take time work sick future. He’s stupid. got line watch side effects. Bullshit, want guinea pig.

I'm even one anti-vaccine psychos, want take first wave drug.

Fuck dude spinning like he's philanthropist. Man first 6 months sucked, past time. pancreas starting mess take medicine rest life. 29 stopped, big problem. headed bad place fast, would hungover every day, decided something live for(my wife). I’m excited try live music sober. Leave lol Lol glad that’s takeaway get note. live somewhere people flock world, would leave say live far away parents?

Also, it’s pretty sad place zero emphasis family. comment upvoted? people really mistrusting vaccine? Even got vaccine live air, people like would saying saline. 
And said already got vaccine would faction people saying “oh COURSE rich powerful get cut line”. There’s pleasing everyone, maybe he’s thinks right playing rules everyone else?  knows side effects... makes sense prioritize someone likely severely affected virus. people prioritized first vulnerable second people high chance give vulnerable person like doctors nurses. 

Indeed worry prisons meat packers regards virus. wont solve anything. Honestly making conditions places better solve cost precious vaccines. Less people area decrease chance spread it. Give poor workers prisoners space would prefer vaccine. give workers bit wage shorter shifts increase resistance virus aswell. places way bigger issues virus try fix instead. possibly exposed person confirmed COVID positive. long wait get testing? fear get tested early test inaccurate. ""Conspiracy theory"" weaponized term, used mostly stop people looking [science 9/11](http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7). doctor's defense, blame incorrect opinion it. He's pathologist told that. ill equipped answer question banking fact basically wait entire pandemic wanted to. again, told mentioned times. focus simply wife work outside. likely get covid commute work me. overall moot point, I'm trying can. Lol Yes, also correct. 

I providing OP article links numbers back CDC .....and Burden page mentioned above. read links research.

Tbh don’t think really get true number COVID19 deaths (nor flu) perhaps years ever. suspect numbers US quite bit off, simply volume deaths. Processing numbers sadly take years. highly doubt cancer falls “elective” non-essential. feel bad agreeing. baby June, love soul, don’t know say would gone trying last summer knew coming. multiple friends gotten pregnant currently trying, it’s mind boggling me. Kind like CEO UF Health getting first dose florida, lol much confidence knowing rich well connected get vaccine first. would also probably getting experimental drugs contracted too. Forget 10 years. remember seeing Nuvaring birth control commercials January one year felt like Christmas year lawyer commercials started “did use Nuvaring get cancer? Call now...”  I’m pretty sure year!

I’m conspiracy anti vaxx whatever. skepticism still wise. Pfizer make vaccine Sorry brain remark, irritated something Else. apologise.

So basically saying vaccine 100% secure. still want brand new vaccine, cause genuenly think safer without. 

Btw can't say anything long term sideeffects(if Any) yet, wait least 5 years that.

My point is, stigmatize look would rather virus vaccine. important force take it. 

Otherwise respect opinion evrybody Else opinion, pro against, long decide body, i'm happy. 

PS sorry miss spelling, english main language. rule 2 older want sympathy dying dead. Yea, us kind ran sweet sweet sympathy juices long ago shown morals ethical standards toward others.

Plus 74 million racists. administered millions people next week enough them, doubt would convinced already took it, later time take PR photo getting placebo.  know really scientific thinking vaccines microchips inside turn people zombies know single nurse doesn’t ghost story. 

I know lot nurses.   Idk they've Canada lock downs stopped elective surgeries non-emeegencies. People would needed surgery survive still procedures. statistic from? klar kann man manchmal leute darauf hinweisen dass sie die maske falsch tragen

problematisch wirds wenn zb die polizei einen bus platzt und alle die zu dem zeitpunkt die maske unter der nase tragen bußgeld zahlen müssen. ja das ist/war deutschland der fall. das ist diese unangenehme kleinkariertheit.

masken helfen bei covid nicht signifikant. daher finde ich den maskenzwang sich problematisch. falls ich falschliege lese ich gerne eine studie dazu

man kann von impfung und maske und social distancing halten man will,
aber zwang geht garnicht. legitimate concerns vaccine technology long term risks due lack data, well poisoning conspiracy nonsense (e.g. Gates, population control, whatever) drowns delegitimizes it... said much long term data Covid either light deaths, socially responsible thing becomes getting vaccine. dont get it. provide personal experience combined statistics showing hospitals close full somehow im told get hospitals full doctors keep up. Im sorry situation different you. obviously cam come conclusion using different set facts. would disagree that. ""traditional"" college student graduates around 21 22 years old. like everyone suddenly stops fun age. would argue lot people even begin enjoy things point actually money things. Tuition fees typical go year year. staying additional year increase amount debt might graduate with. 
 
Yeah, college life fun, social life suddenly end graduate. Yeah I'm 100% _____ Busta Rhymes would say. Generally trust vaccine going effective harm people. time, I'm wrong, US government long history giving fuck health wellbeing. Reddit remind 6 months Statistics involving 200,000 schoolkids 47 states last two weeks September yielded overall coronavirus infection rate .13 percent among students .24 percent staffers, according Brown University economics Professor Emily Oster team number-crunchers.

Looks like data. wouldn’t chance committing genetic fallacy URL? Surely you’re low-information. game called? Cyberpunk? According webpage, large majority ICU beds taken Covid-19 patients. looks like Covid propaganda, trying make reader think lack ICU beds due Covid patients stating facts contemporaneously, fact 303 888 ICU beds use Covid patients state. Levine trans woman (assigned male birth identifies woman), spot-on rest post. course, vaccine perfect. Articles saying vaccine might limit spread attribute loosening mask-wearing due people believing immune they’re (because, again, vaccine perfect). we’ll still need wear masks. masks + vaccine probably effective controlling spread masks alone. Maybe don’t know something, shouldn’t talking it? Let's honest, mom basically organized crime point Don’t want get hopes without cause, I’d pretty surprised weren’t pretty much running then.  Exactly.

They developed vaccine ones managing production vaccine. course senior level management key R&amp;D teams 100% get vaccine first.

They essential gets they’re going pump billions vaccines next 12 months. Lol

No chance hell ""every employer"" going mandate this. dramatic fuck. 

You free skip vaccine. likely inconvenienced decision. times due refusal give urine analysis. two doses could matter someone gets vaccinated time. 

Unless surplus vaccines, waiting best course action. surplus, taking would make sense prove hold outs it’s safe (Assuming change mind) 100%

I don’t think anti-science fundamentally republican trait.

Agreed. could’ve delayed worse. Thankful wasn’t. Yup. right here. Wow. Guy afford island get vaccine poors... humanitarian...  Crazy thing means even room emergency departments board patients either lame answer. choice need fly?? generous Long term effects also almost exclusively occur risk groups. people might die people survive might long term. people vaccinated rest population doesn’t suffer long term worrying rate rare? know 2 people twice already. 6 months apart ...oh... oh wow! Yeah, you’re paid enough listen kind noise. Ugh, I’m sorry. strange conviction have, right? point going less virus-influential positions, nurse acting bridge large virus pool general public at-risk populations valuable person vaccinate. perspective societal whole real loss actions CEO convinced nurses vaccinate. Lol, syntax delivery make obvious. 600,000,000 need 2 I'm afraid Pfizer due weird ass lawsuits. even available yet, though, guess okay scared right now

If many sketchy lawsuits sketchy lawsuits mountain sketchy lawsuits belt I'd way less concerned. I've never concerned vaccine actually research Pfizer. companies I'd want vaccine from, Johnson Johnson

I'd prefer Sanofi Pasteur. trust. choose different job. 


Every employer mandate it.


I use drugs, refuse submit drug testing workplace believe violation medical privacy. take jobs demand pee. one force unless I'm direct violation law. 

There's law states must vaccinated. one proposed law

The Virginia did,  Australia. I'm anti-vax, new type vaccine delivery mechanism mRNA. think like previous techniques using dead virus parts virus, might less hesitation. old techniques billions sample sizes vs tens thousands sample size. 

That said, would gladly take jab soon offered me. usually really bad reactions normal flu vaccines too. trust doctors nurses clinic reactions getting jab. he’s essential worker works home. Like really doesn’t need it. He’s damned does, damned doesn’t. 

If took it, see Reddit post saying “CEO takes vaccine ahead frontline workers” offense needs read got made quickly. Like look able call data 😂 Meanwhile dumbasses threads constantly spit bogus claims infection rate Florida. Haha meanwhile new York adds another 10k cases today dig deep net find articles it. almost like want people know bad instead focus elsewhere. Never forget New York deaths 😂 call source rare? small universe know 2 people who’ve twice already.  people (including vulnerable, high-risk people) can’t get vaccinated variety reasons (compromised immune system, various allergies, medical conditions). Waiting flu shot idiot entered waiting room without mask on. put one realized people waiting, people suck. certainly zero intention trying this. 

I curious they're identical formulas. Thanks info. don’t care getting cold flu. I’m young. want see students faces experience normal college, dance, fun . don’t like wearing 8 hours day. It’s depressing uncomfortable. like wearing makeup seeing expressions. It’s problem like it. problem seem suggest even pandemic over, continue living like one catch flu. never point this, COVID. Stop trying push new normal me. want life.  Sure imperfect dataset causes deaths result interventions. Less flu deaths hide causes increasing.

But I'm sure many write papers making estimate range said done. Moderna severe COVID cases vaccinated group. So, no, considering Oxford cheaper easier transport &amp; store, course given nigh-limitless global demand, significant result. wish Seattle southern neighbor LA :( No, vaccines nothing help regain taste smell.

The loss function result persistent viral infection far tell. cellular damage repairing yet. People super horrified, ""What expect *me do*? ***Skip Christmas?***""

People even fucking wear masks. spike early January going titanic proportions. got pro-vaccine people saying lasts 2-4 weeks even true. fuck. Sorry hear it. Hope 100% recovery soon. Sharon colon cancer. 2k dead day november/december..sometimes 3k day. sure guess good news coming fair Death important metric. understand that? Oxford vaccine first, top Moderna/Pfizer enough supplies. don’t get :( Jfc. cares? CEO directly involved vaccine development. you’re really looking someone take see trustworthy, try one doctors directly involved. can't talk people phone ever? Unless deaf hard hearing, need see people's mouths understand intention. We're talking general public. People might nonsensical small talk (which hate, useless banter reason whatsoever). Nobody's saying wear masks around social group everyone vaccinated comfortable wearing them.  known complications, acute chronic, covid. vaccine anything nearly bad covid happen anybody. 

The vaccine incident referring happened batches made one company live virus them. due vaccine actual virus. hell turning music Covid. turning “everyone live according personal tastes” stated, (and others) already taken it. There's magical line equality, spread misinformation right, can't print Euros directly, print sell bonds. sister cousin getting first shots next week live KS. Thank explaining would get immune effects (fatique, soreness, etc) - would mounting immune responses time. There's advantage. hogging supply someone else needs. We'll get control. children picture made Santa, smiles bigger day head school, risk exposure exist.

One things necessary want emphasize ~~no children forced attend events that~~ choice left solely hands parents.

And fuck supposed mean anyway? think people think they're forcing parents take kids see Santa? I've never understood folks think hiking group (even trailing person front 6+ feet) safe.

You necessarily continuously walking exhalation bubble. 

Similarly, passing someone going opposite direction seems unlikely infectious. short term outdoor exposure. That's one orderd officially country :/

Its better nothing.

But think Oxford vaccine great advantages. 

1- Cheaper, though something like this, I'd pay better protection. 
2- Distribution simply much simpler. Right survival rate anyone 70 99,995 10,000. vaccine shows survival rate increase 99,998 10,000, statistically significant. Sir, appreciate enthusiasm please put pants back on....it goes arm.... recommend read protocol-specified analysis efficacy asymptomatic infection time EUA submission. However, collect pre-dose 1 pre-dose nasopharyngeal swabs SARS-CoV-2 virus performed descriptive comparing number positive swabs pre-dose 2 timepoint baseline participants get early idea possibility prevention asymptomatic Amongst baseline negative participants, 14 vaccine group 38 placebo group evidence SARS-CoV-2 infection second dose without evidence symptoms. approximately 2/3 fewer swabs positive vaccine group compared placebo group pre-dose 2 timepoint, suggesting infections start prevented first dose. acceptance human reality. personally would exist planet ancestors procreate. Hence owe entire life act sacrifice. Thanks telling feel something ALSO dead wrong. DOCTORS PHDS okayed virus (not big pharma reps - sorry hurt contrived viewpoint me!!). It’s great know idiots took one immunology course undergrad worried virus best public health schools country support. Really means lot. morons like weigh likely even less schooling. Yeah think I’ll listen professors doctors literal decades experiences accolades prove random internet weirdo scared needle. Fuck Right... there's tons evidence long term use masks general public (not published year)? Dont think so, recommended mandated use before, scale. Italia, Spain, France mandating masks? many months they? numbers speak themselves... fun compare Norwegian healthcare system US. ask trustworthy. That’s good point therapeutic relationship. still wouldn’t surprised though changes everything way hospitals operate. congrats! Yup. I’ve realized wearing cloth mouth nose even problem. keeps getting cold flu fall winter, great! 

Why issue anyone? BREAKING NEWS: Medication may cause side effects people... 🤦‍♂️ frustrating thing assholes refuse wear mask assholes refuse get vaccine. Thoughts prayers hairpiece could referring vents way refer beds, suggest can't reasonably people vents due limiting factors like rts/mds/nurses.

I also feel bit remark comparing invasiveness ecmo vs vent. invasive, different ways. Maybe biases work anesthetist Canada smaller centers I've tubed vented many many patients, placing someone ecmo still feels like big deal.

Also, PE driver hypoxia covid, driver. Endothelial damage without thrombus another aspect, mucus plugging another... Also, isolated pulmonary edema (""fluid lungs"") preferably treated bipap possible. Initially many centers avoiding concern aerosolizing virus, seems commonly used now, least combined negative pressure room.

Anyways despite nitpicks comments generally agree statements. Yeah that’s mainly would too. Correction, *or immediate tribe*, care.

""If ReAl, SoMeOnE ***i PerSoNaLlY*** kNoW wOuLd DiEd It!!!""""

They're incapable empathy apply immediate tribe. attempt reach vile trick try trick tribe resources, something beneficial *someone else*, perish thought!

Because that's *they look life*, assume *everyone looks life* way. Everything grift, sort. There's always self-interested ulterior motive. they're determined ""not used"". reason idolize Trump - he's open, unapologetic grifter, see ultimate honesty. ""EVERYONE CHEATS, LIES, STEALS GAIN, LEAST MAKES PUBLIC!!!"" Lol get every vaccination ever, want wait get one definitely rushed (not saying that’s bad thing like I’m glad it’s there) fact hasn’t gone NEAR testing vaccines use today soooooo. 

Can garuntee 99.98% won’t lasting side effects? know everything set enough transmit covid-19? Also, say passenger reported positive case you, believe them? ancestors procreate, would exist all. stopped procreating, humanity likewise cease exist. don’t know long immunity lasts anyone. don’t know long immunity lasts asymptomatic cases all. Lol ok still seen anyone say long effective for... Last knew antibodies last long, taking shot every quarter point? disease magically disappear 50 60% population (maybe less) actually get vaccine? think we're getting ahead thinking magically end all. mean... spread like wildfire among people social distance, wear masks, get vaccine. I'm monster empathy pushed limits lately. look parts strategy well. quote atealein's first interim report take place 30 November year spread infection elderly care, delayed two second partial report made 31 October 2021 include account virus' spread within Sweden, health service's ability handle virus outbreak communication due virus outbreak. final report must submitted later 28 February 2022.

But also wonder members comission background medicine statistical analysis? selected them?

I agree someone background medicine, example. [And criticized (paywall, sorry, find another link). ""Fun"" fact: criticism article comes Royal Swedish Academy Sciences, organization awards nobel prize-

They selected government support parliament, Sweden ruled minority coalition accept demands oppositio. demands oppositionen included politicians part it, final result finished next election. Good info know. Still sound like best solution kill covid long term, depends. 

If could emit level UV light pretty much instantly kills virus, build purifier device high air circulation rate, small enough go homes, affordable buy run, might big step forward. ..But lot 'ifs' still sounds like solution virus.

That said, I'm seeing develop something like that, last pandemic face. guess US timeline: 

this week could all-time peak case totals slow declines/plateaus next six weeks so. 

Moderna A/Z vaccines approved end month. J&amp;J approved end February. 

death rate starts plummet around mid February due vaccination elderly high risk groups. cases start go way around early March. 

reach approximate severity Flu largely return normal sometime May 15th June 15th. outdoor events, restaurant seating, movie theaters largely reopened, depending area in.

""herd immunity"" July August. mask requirements gone everywhere except airports, doctor offices, public transit, nursing homes. terribly unsound approach based solid evidence, anecdotes assumptions Aww 😢 guess go Christmas dinner instead! understand that. saying done emergency approval too, given know vaccines safe effective, would save lives. details could worked later regular approval. keep making point I'll end conversation here. feel bad college freshmen going lose best year social lives. ironic thread couple weeks ago talked flu cases going New Zealand Covid response. Someone posted mortician friend hurting lack business. price big. biggest thing distribution. Literally easiest distribute. Maybe because:

1. Pfizer’s documentation UK government’s website says data fertility impact unknown vaccine impacts fertility. Don’t think people know taking it?

2. don’t know ADE (antibody dependent enhancement). don’t know? animal challenge studies animals receive vaccine challenged live virus.

Generally, coronavirus vaccines past (SARS-COV 1, MERS) failed. failed vaccine tried animals, animals died.

3. FDA documentation discusses many severe autoimmune lookout for. say reactions likely, enough reason give anyone pause. particular, death, ADE, fertility listed. saw spinal autoimmune reaction trials. 

4. vaccine creates protein spike cells previously there. long term effects risks extra protein spike? cancer? don’t know cannot long term studies vaccine.

I links official documentation supporting work moment.

It’s incredible bizarre would call people dumb fucks don’t want take vaccine developed several months, without mid long term data safety efficacy. Nah, I’m still going wear mask airplanes. hate going trip catch sore throat shit way there, total buzz kill. 

Elsewhere though? Definitely mask. See first comment said I’d wait 6 months. 

I’m aware long trials been. I'm sorry. sucks. I've wanted ask business owner pandemic chance - making peace fact 700+ employees contracted COVID-19 1 employee died working make profit? guilt? absolved guilt? cost/benefit analysis it? 

I'm definitely trying shame you, blame you. trying understand ""other"" side this. problem long history allergic reactions various drugs, starting penicillin (rash) variety rheumatoid vaccines. Oxford vaccine, whilst potentially least beneficial, looks like best route me. reccomenations welcome.
Edit swap suggestions recommendations. I’mma mix together cocktail shaker stick bases covered Gavin Newson Andrew Cuomo burning thier states ground kings ashes. sufficient explanation. reason job cannot socially distance stay away covid positive people. nurse ICU luxury able stay away covid positive people. Vaccines short supply lot good given healthcare worker CEO. want public faith vaccine, wait available public get it, first line low-risk group care. first vaccines delivered hospital work! first tier getting vaccine take asap. Exciting get sliver light end tunnel. Hi there, mRNA half life measured hours -on average 7.

You require interfering RNA degrade. 5' 3' exonucleases well endonucleases always acting mRNA. ppl don’t take vaccines, ppl would gotten Bell’s palsy. Absolutely. safe well! lot cases it’s going people refusing vaccinated since also refused wear mask. know, doesn’t account essential workers others living multigenerational homes, it’s bad start. GBS listed side effect vaccine insert vaccines.

"". . . Guillain-Barré syndrome usually preceded infection immune stimulation induces aberrant autoimmune response targeting peripheral nerves spinal roots.""

By definition, vaccines ""immune stimulation,"" sometimes induce aberrant autoimmune response. 

You can't get COVID flu vaccine, get GBS. recover COVID, pretty much can't GBS.  

If 65 years old, likely contract GBS die COVID. doesn’t look like redoing study approval. Despite mix dosage, still enough data prove safety minimal efficacy vaccine. another trial vaccine Russian Sputnik vaccine see one dose would provide greater immunity two doses vaccine (both vaccines modified, attenuated adenovirus).  might source confusion. trial shouldn’t cause pause approval. Remember still trials going current chemo drugs test slight changes protocol combinations affect benefit. mid October Dr. Fauci made prediction sounds similar title. course lot happened since then. going profound degree herd immunity considerable period time, maybe toward end 2021, 2022,” said. “I feel strongly we’re going need degree public-health measures continue. Maybe stringent right Masks fine I’m okay wearing indefinitely. needs end we’re expected wear one. prefer half face covered time public, gets pretty annoying. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've heard this... reduction severe covid others like pfizer/moderna? I’m beginning wonder anti-vax assholes start flashing around fake vaccination cards show don’t need wear mask. Gofundyourself wedding supposed June hope right. Nah, true. majority give damn vaccinated. become part statistics ""low"" one bat eye. find bad thing. one really sure virus might them. Florida many deaths California despite 1/3rd population.

You smoking boomer, Columbian, OAN, coccaine thinking that. Aka. Stop bitching, something works. Honestly seems sociopathic suggest covering half face akin putting hat. Seeing someone's face important reading emotional experiences understanding intentions. language comes secondary human experience. I'm never, ever going treat mask wearing like putting shoes. actually vaccinating health care workers also grandmothers sweet handing cookies. Unless source saying happened please share.

I source Covid19 ICU admissions age group 80+ dropped sharply weeks 49 50 (confirmed [FHM official number infection age group decreased. think it? Tbh I'm ready life back. done shit since January watch people around caring (and couple dying it).

I **more happy part** continue stay home I'm vaccinated happy resume activities vaccinated family friends. trials continously evaluated. data comes bit bit point enough certainty works big sideeffects.

Today stated got new batch data enables shorten release monday next week. like using amount data.

The thing x % data need, do? That's approvals emergency approvals. Don’t mean two needles, since you’ll need 2 injections? Oxford looking like Late January. Well plan wearing pandemic basically then. guys flu deaths. masks forever crowd never stop huh? every risk life gone? wear masks 8 hours+ day enforce job don’t call anti masker either. pandemic. adults actually get pretty much good enough protect kids well. dumb fucks refuse get sooner kids get safer Wear mask stick sock it... Literally mouth nose. Californian here. We're ""full lockdown"" too, since like 2 weeks ago. things described happening here, officially, too. Compliance enforcement different, depending live work. hope dont go full normal. like people standing fucking close me. like coworkers FORCED stay home sick. like people practicing good hand hygiene time. like stores wiping shit every while. 


I used go go-karting. bet things never santized ever. often guy next theater sick?

I used get throat infection 3-4 times year. havent much cough itchy throat 10 months. Fuck full normal, lets keep habits. Edited title. Reported. blind? Depends federal government. 100% Fauci taking live TV. healthcare remembers seeing Fauci's name college textbooks. truthfully, doubt amongst healthcare workers feel like guinea pigs (even pro vaccine.) Whether like not, people think way. 

I've embarrassed fellow lefties insisting living parallel universe, rather dealing reality. 

Masks political *but are*

The government paying people stay home *but ain't*

Everyone medically able get vaccine *but won't*

Living complete denial helping anyone. Wait what?


What's about?

He mentioned full stadiums late Spring/early mentioned herd immunity late Spring another interview.

Why would need keep wearing masks distance? I’m sure 655,000 people keeled died heart disease time foreign country drop bombs them, people would make bigger deal need 70% vaccinated return kind normal. vulnerable groups vaccinated hospitalisations drop enough prevent biggest concerns probably enough drop R 1 restrictions lifted. Thanks Gov. Reeves. You’re real winner. epitome reactive proactive danger particularly great children, since modes, cloud droplets hovers distance ground half height infected person — words, mouth level children.

Note: study without masks obviously Fauci pretty known never giving best case scenario dude. gives conservative estimates said himself. I'm sorry endure that. someone adult sucked big time life altering. One side face dropped blink eye 6 months. wear eye patch protect it. way could drink straw. Eating chewing food nightmare. one reason another extremely serious others less so. 5 yr recovery I'm still 80% recovered.  serious long term effects something wish upon one.. 

The fact called something watch concerning. Yeah living society literally deprive basic freedom - freedom movement assembly. government torpedo economy destroy jobs will. society turns citizens other. I’d say pretty scary. 

I’ve mostly complied restrictions almost year done. mental health seriously stake. Screw your. huns themselves. came comment nurses believe essential oils actual medicine frightening Masks helped seasonal allegories much. wear pollen season regardless. Hmm sure w vaccinations. gotta go public health officials man *the fuck* would something like that? expect quarantine last entirety 30yr lease? Maybe fucking waited pandemic seen industry norms WFH would buying house. Hell, would've able buy next massive market crash that's scheduled happen finally take stock long term damage quarantine caused. feel like vaccinate elderly first...Vaccination elderly bring death rate virtually zero. grocery store workers really getting priority elderly since grocery store workers essential? Bingo. Even populations similar, 38% 25% apples oranges. One death rate one active cases. younger people, 25% increase cases might result increase death rate 2.5% --and think even would pessimistic. \-Arizona Ah, call ""lockdown"" Germany. distinction ""Lockdown Light"", shops allowed open permit certain number people according shopping area ""Full Lockdown"" entered pretty much every non-essential shop closed. 
Guess government wants seriously slow spreading hospitals deal christmas spreader event, since irritatingly loosened meeting restrictions - usually we're currently allowed meet five people two households most, although christmas loosened ""it's okay close family"". hair dye manufacturers said thing. link chemicals hair dye cancer. Thought like 95%. nerds really get bullshit make mandatory. mandatory pay parking, fuck important shit voluntary. best environment kill children. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director health charity Wellcome, [told could serious, Alan McNally, expert University Birmingham, warned people “be hysterical.”

“It doesn’t mean it’s transmissible infectious dangerous. something keep eye on,” told broadcaster.

Noting “huge efforts” study strain, said, “It important keep calm rational perspective.”

The WHO’s chief emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, said “mutations like quite common,” stressing far, nothing confirm deadly spreads easily.

Hancock also insisted “it highly unlikely new variant impinge vaccine impact vaccine.” something get behind! “new normal” people say “our flu numbers historically low let’s wear masks forever!” Like bruh get flu wear them, I’m going wear one time flu season. Really, horribly managed states like South Dakota cases steadily going down... Well yeah sure hate going ""office every day part"" returning normal already work remotely 1 day year basically proof slack home actually lot things especially complex ones disturbed every 2 minutes. yeah, going 3 days per week bye bye. worries conspiracies already there. Going way prove safe wont help that, it’ll make people ask ‘why need convince us safe safe’

 1 dose 1 dose person exposed covid day. Getting dose even day earlier prevent infection. person sees eyes affects covid i’m sure isnt vaccine much normal population might be. said arent jumping line didnt say wont ever take it. people dont want take months away even able take thing anyway. portion underlying health conditions push forward vaccinated classes February March? 

For intents purposes pandemic going public health perspective March April.  Google mRNA clinical trials several papers clinical trials pop up. (HIV + Leukemia treatments). 

I think unreasonable can't quantify claims going contradict top scientists. evidence points safe. There's precedent vaccine safe clinical trials harmful years later ""dangerous"" delivery methods. 

Lets assume harmful. I'm sure logical take 1 million chance vaccine Covid-19 kills 0.04% right? Science method interaction physical reality. would prefer invisible skyperson primal instincts, go it. going happen.

Especially 'social unrest' (political violence) normalized earlier year. Politicians' houses burn try that. whole sense self clearly tied pandemic. us want choice live lives done. didn’t agree two years life, best years life, pause. absurd hell. Healthcare workers “vulnerable” vaccinated spring. It’s enough!! Lol I’m sure WebMD degree great things world Ok, smart people get vaccinated live normally rest keep getting Covid herd immunity. SoCal virus back October (completely asymptomatic) I'm supposed take unnecessary vaccine could f face up? thanks combination reduced R summer, high infection immunity high vaccine immunity going absolutely destroy virus without 85% vaccinated. get next winter we'll need vaccination rate right up, fingers crossed enough time enough willing. No, maybe helmet. Might case, counts drop government need keep updating. premier 2-3 hr questions media everyday numbers every day five months.

It hard got lots grief (our federal gov conservative everything antfuck policies instead dealing virus).

The Murdoch papers hated TV channels run conservatives also attacked daily.

We okay premier Dan Andrew’s well.

I try judge Dutch standards father-in-law. would one fuckwits protesting. reduces symptoms massive amount get it, prevents getting like 95%.

All stuff said irrelevant two things true. prevents getting 95%, R0 going drop significantly. reduces symptoms, R0 going drop know symptomatic cases account way transmission asymptomatic. reduces symptoms mortality, even less fear.

If get shot year like flu that’s also end world. I’d rather wear masks, social distance, fuck small businesses. 2019 levels normal back 2022. 

It'll significantly improve vulnerable front-line workers vaccinated though. Mid-summer good estimate. kids far bigger problems masks ahead them. much obvious. Continuing wear mask rest life personal choice free make. pretend though completely rational. not. could apply exact logic never leaving house anything essential errands die. Tracking top priority, IMO. True username usually homes poor areas rich people live different set rules. think that. That's smart. 

Kind related anecdote: pre cancer due HPV cervix, found pap smear. took like 5 different appointments biopsies surgeries clear it. reading online, talked women developing countries often die treatable condition resources keep returning doctor. :( definitely, could help people one done visit vaccine, would better vs minor inconvenience us richer countries go doctor twice. Many people around CA totally disillusioned lockdown measures - relatively strict measures months, looks like going end exact place relatively less strict states anyway. 

But really. 

Florida half population California almost many COVID deaths. Texas 10 million fewer people CA, 4,000 COVID deaths CA.

The virus always going bad federal government plan apparently fine state things. California would much worse state city governments act did.

Now, could get Orange County stop Orange County five whole minutes...  small number non-elderly people die, cares!

Never mind permanent neurological damage, lung damage, heart damage, kidney damage. 

Oh, causes erectile dysfunction. 

People like denied ability learn understand reason US one highest numbers infected dead world. parents, mentors, teachers utterly failed killed 400,000 people.  think good balance. one mind masks love idea wearing mine public places flu season, certainly think mandated. also think though people shamed wearing masks become socially acceptable thing do. (Edit: wearing mask post-covid also totally socially acceptable.) spend time trying protect kids shield innocence. It’s piece cloth. gross oversimplification. Faucis estimate getting shorter shorter. think he’s overly conservative gain compliance winter ends. can’t tell weddings honestly, wouldn’t blame one attending one late summer. I’d hard pressed find one would. We’ve put lives hold long enough. Epidemiologists scream blue face reality mob majority decide “over”. I’m hard time believing won’t mid summer absolute latest. Hindsight 20/20 really see U.S. get complacent. mean joking smart-ass kind way. Like work family, really feel like I'm one concerned catching more. checked Sweden way 25th deaths/million rankings. happen? top 10 day? It’s still unclear exactly going take place. Say you’re random elderly person like doesn’t regular doctor use medical care regular basis. announce 60 65 good go go local CVS Walgreens? get it. impact anyone something controlled government. Simply yammering like shows know I'm right think disparaging remarks defense. clearly clue freedom is. he's going data released pharmaceutical companies quickly produce distribute various vaccines, effective are, many people access x amount time, etc. data set SHIFTS EVERY DAY. understand mean that's works. Stop acting like child. Oh okay. one dose efficacy 10 days likely efficacy 0-10 somewhere &lt;52%, averages 52. Thank explanations reading reports quite difficult. [only time back early 2000’s (don’t know tech changed since then), plasma exchanger way treat disease started soon realized GBS. size large refrigerator tube pumped blood chest catheter, strained plasma white blood cells, warmed blood back up, mixed healthy donor plasma put back return connection. took weeks worth daily treatment get back track treatment hours day least remember. Approval nice, drug injected volunteers weeks ago. hasn’t really changed, opinion - slightly skeptical yet hopeful. political side issue become giant mess, mandates ignored, case numbers jumping, population area strongly pushing back control measures, it’s enough sway opinion many. Personally, risk Covid complications low, wife fighting cancer isn’t lucky. possible risks posed vaccine likely less damaging get Covid. So, back original downvoted comment...... faith vaccine remains unchanged, due circumstances around outside control, certainly get vaccine ASAP - due faith it. It’s simply situation weighting risks one another. Good luck that. going up, going down... Almost like matter who's governor... think fear effective own. There's shortage fear-based media subject COVID. 

What's missing link vague statistics individual experience. personal efforts minimize contact societal benefits reduced hospital demand higher standards care. 

We need stories highlighting standard care existed last year specific ailments vs exist regions overwhelmed. single fuzzy image person ventilator it. one expects they'll end ventilator. 

I read story redditor last night buddy work whose infected cut led sepsis collapsing job. None nearby hospitals room accept patient died 90 minute ambulance ride nearest open hospital, leaving behind young family.

You can't scare people behaving, they've inoculated much fear already. believe personalize issue enough make notice. super bowl fact talks living happily masks social distance shows he’s sociopath. Literally sociopath - happiness distance? loser. Imagine believing wearing mask ""restriction."" Pathetic. stimulus check mostly went toward rent, unemployment backpay came, got iPad. Apple Pencil great digital drawing, I’ve sold handmade stickers already, don’t regret purchase. gastric reflux causes cough. gotten dirty look. Sure, law allow litigation collection damages circumstances, we're living corporatacrocy backed state mafia, free market. mean since we're topic vaccines, literally special vaccine court shield pharma companies standard litigation. Imagine Al Capone Pablo Escobar running society special rules protected business partners crushing small businesses entrepreneurs.


Sorry, know I'm way topic. pointing free market - incentive pursue profit - produced far wealth harm since we've embraced 200+ years ago. thing airborne thus much higher base R0 value become better defined. superspread incidents dozens people getting infected despite close contact *also* mean find unvaccinated people room. need infect intervening people. Japan needs get too. state, 4.4% 40-49 year olds tested positive hospitalized. would say rare would assume people would negative health outcomes able receive care. first ever Reddit funded scholarship, let’s lol Cases Basically everything recreational California closed 9 months.  He's right. Anyone believes people voluntarily submit restrictions public begins get vaccinated living fantasy land. Indulging wishful thinking productive. semblance normalcy then? think that's wayyyy too
 pessimistic, honestly think summer we'll mostly back normal. fauci hack says whatever people telling say. ""deprive childhood""

it's one fucking Christmas. ONE!!! seriously much harder childhood one festival missing turned okay. drama queen Oh, honey. point, know instant spit test would really game changer (V)(;,,;)(V) 1 vaccine please! Fauci misquoted lot, actually inconsistent communication?

Less 24 hours ago predicted herd immunity spring, predicted masks needed next winter, this.

It cannot true. wear get vaccinated, brainer me. depend data long vaccine effective, get booster annual shot. period time think might protected (and could unknowingly pass on) I’ll go back wearing one. planned, totally organic. hospital really looks overwhelmed there. wonder question pandemic. think underestimate long term impact collective psyche this. Japan also lot mask wearing doesn’t level air pollution typically people think China. It’s conscientiousness thing flu more-so solely pollution. bad enough MetroHealth close several locations due covid-related staffing issues Cle Clinic rotating doctors usual positions weeks. real serious impact least 2 Cleveland’s big systems nothing increased testing delayed results. Best grilled cheese.  problem disinformation, amount population get high enough. People allergies, transplants, etc etc, cannot get least foreseeable future, need rely upon rest us spread it. Since significant portion population going refuse get it, also refuse wear masks, impasse. Additionally, people going wear wristbands signify ""immune""? course not, so..... know person immune, complete self important asshole? Masks unfortunately need stay while, regardless. Deadly dihydrogen monoxide fetuses  lot idiots living country. lot. trouble tactic is, soon people figure exaggerated lied way credibility shot effort becomes counterproductive. people never get convinced anyway. 

If really wanted gameify would 

A) give optional tax rebate getting vaccine
B) require congress reach certain level adoption state receive funds state and/or able vote salary increases congress
C) require n% level nation wide adoption (whatever goal set tier 3, member congress staff recieve it. 

Watch Republicans say real change tune want get families vaccinated funding. Dont let say virus real quietly getting vaccinated- drawing dangerous anti-intelectual line sand make in-group voters.  people dying right COVID, around US. can't magically put disease hold vaccine research sorted out. there's 62% effective vaccine available **right now**, injecting anyone can't get access 90% one now. Yes, roughly enough 60% adult population. combined natural immunity massive impact community spread, hospitalization deaths. Probably May-July given logistical distribution issue. primary campaign, right Kamala got selected VP, political commentators highlighted ran poor campaign, showed little support able muster end. experienced winning tight electoral contests exercise strict messaging discipline. stupid off-the-cuff remark highlighted blind spots comes politics communication. hope adjusts quickly.  way worse. NYC spring, nurses US brought help NYC. Now, nurses already working asses hospitals. boof it, free!  what?

Even though logic hold (doctors nurses last two days given choice; likely influenced Biden campaign's negative stance vaccine), let's pretend does. Fine. caused people *next week* take vaccine.

What fucking difference make?

Again - *desperate* little shred reason excuse behavior impacts. great! hope something happens it. need treatments much need vaccines. Contradicts people saying, send proof... “major backpedaling”. active job outside horrible mask well. Especially sweat much me. Biden can, should, use Defense Production Act maximize production distribution vaccines.   kind crappy attitude, I'm sure many unfair things also happen - reap sow. doubt WFH ending anytime soon. Plenty businesses excited making employees provide office space, phone, internet, etc. fine it, live people, shop people, work people, take entertainment people. good us *all*, take vaccine. read Torah, find unselfish good others supported. always thought that's sorta understandable. saw momma cry eyes thought worst. 

I miss middle ground common sense. Also yell ""huh?"" every third sentence whomever I'm speaking public. Maybe that's restriction, hindrance communication. would this? gives damn? mask permanent solution affecting immune system. ""weakened immune system"" people never want leave house that's them. burning mask returning society like normal human.  Lol third population vaccinated June Moderna &amp; pfizer. exactly J&amp;J bring us back normal? Damn man, Im sorry. 
Keep chin keep fighting. 
Things get better. fine it, live people, shop people, work people, take entertainment people. good us *all*, take vaccine. read Torah, find unselfish good others supported. would this? gives damn? mask permanent solution affecting immune system.

What preserving? Especially “vulnerable” vaccinated April. excuse then? 

I’m even mitigation low risk general public access vaccines. I’m government mitigation point. 100 percent. year rationalize.’two years cannot. really want guy getting vaccine health care workers?

Yes. He's literally CEO Send bobs vaccine There's reason get rid it; hospital environment designed sterile clean possible minimize spread anything everything. Masks way easier implement preventative measure major downside use. Tough luck. Life isn’t fair. vaccinated certainly don’t need mask... Yeah people don’t like fact reinfection rate low doesn’t fit narrative “careless” enough get covid first place somehow punished later line exactly epidemiologists experts said.  cold weather sets people get confined indoors, going see real serious surge.  happening everywhere northern hemisphere now. thought healthcare system favored government employees... Guess not??? fair feel bad places like grocery stores etc deal public masses. Lots idiots held liable one customer infecting another decided pull mask sneeze browsing Oreos.

It's shitty situation around :( effective quick spit test seems like promising way. classic moron trying speak intelligently like he’s neutral bias. But, everyone see right bs every truly neutral opinion would conclude every vaxxer does. got suspended it. ""The response comes days family doctor's medical license suspended claim false information spread mask-wearing patients, staff general public makes “an immediate danger public.""” . Within span days.. least clarify he's walking back earlier comments? AstraZ already well underway stage 3 trial meets FDA standards sorta crappy UK/Brazil trial reported data. We’re waiting US trial report out. me, entire ""vaccination public"" nonsense anyways. believe vaccine safe, would believe well known person actually even taking vaccine. media (and hell, sub) suppressing numbers want young people get complacent this. want spreading elderly overloading hospitals. yes, death rate anyone 60 actually quite low, especially compared numbers thrown beginning this. Im sure getting downvoted... updoot. Ah. unfortunate unfounded information ends top thread :( way track many people particular country received vaccine? effort underway track number? F'ing 2021 gentle loving seeking completely new method?

/S Unless working out...then it’s major problem. Yeah, people washing hands wearing masks, it’s amazing simple thing kept us getting sick things normally would have. usually expect “cold” every year, didn’t one year, I’m alone circle friends.

Edit: wonder people got flu shot year too. never get I’ve always worked remotely don’t kids (that’s also something didn’t experience year, haven’t kids around maybe they’re ones usually getting sick every year), got year. also prevents spread diseases, like flu common cold. Plus, mask cheap easy. see not. value house Nevada oftentimes taxed less 0.5% (especially older houses tax based historical value.) Plus income tax. pays around casinos. People wanna party. Soon Republican ideals influence Democratic people join unsafe, antimask ways party. total clusterfuck. I'm suspecting august. Yeah thats cool im definitely interested vitals, cuz cant hear without them! could people possibly know enough vaccines mRNA actually make informed decision whether vaccine safe. 

These people dumb fuck Tbh even care anymore, long outdoor activities banned next summer, I'll wear mask however long to. frustrating hell pandemic seems drag forever, really, do? miss lot things life year, ever come back, I'll happier anyone.  mean developing situation, made breakthrough around election time (which imo coincidence nothing more). trump one spreading false notion would widely available vaccine 2020 significant amounts people following*, Fauci (really one listening tbh) repeatedly mentioned vaccines take while, actually making clinical trials FDA stuff. fastest one developed took ~2 years, reasonable expect may happen here, didn’t set record. Stop cynical. get saying, could also add fuel anti vaxxers. ""Why get vaccine congressman wont even it?"" well thoughbout argument, guarantee convince people. strongly suspect anti vaxxers going serious issue rollout. **Please note, questions answered here. Please use thread /r/askscience** vaccine 100 percent effective. live North OC far Knott's people wearing them. people always going A-holes, people area saying F-it. also depends idiots get way Yes, this. 

*""Well, things could way better next year, need prepare best make case they're not.""* number countries testing ... IDK stand. I'm sure WFH culture die completely many roles 5 years

Only people give it. ""WFH suck dick"" campaign something. Indeed!! Yep. North Macedonia government told us expect vaccines March cause refrigerators store them. really hope get 100k vaccines least January medical personnel elderly. heard California Governor say numbers vaccinations California end month exceeding 1 million, assuming Moderna gets approval week. 300-something thousand Pfizer 600-something thousand Moderna. Everything open except sporting events concerts makes sense.   Yeah, man, I'm glad risen sheeple recognize 5G microchipping that's going vaccine introduces mind-control nanobots stopped 5 layers Reynold's Heavy Duty! There's also clearly vague things going mention matter happens, pretend seen coming \#galaxybrain public health agencies every western democracy conspiring say vaccine safe? Canada population posting 6000 cases day.

America really bad stuff, wow. Looks like lose pandemic 1918 one. Crazy I'm LA. cool see continuous investment rail infra throughout county (especially compared NYC's 2nd ave subway quite literally took 85 years planning execution tiny first phase). Metrolink regional rail network particular ton potential. high-speed rail project gets far enough along, unleash ton funding improve service throughout region. 

LA's bus system woefully neglected though, rightfully backbone system. literally evidence wearing mask ""harmful"" go Lol Yes major back pedaling. Look written. Biden won, information regarding actual pace delivery *all* became accepted rather rejected Trump said costs must labeled incompetent every step way Don’t give Bono ideas sayibg wince September. still now. hospital making voluntary. 
But hey! Im sure u work huge network big city. children even vaccine then. mean could also develop common cold virus near future? helps us return normalcy, sure. many people really ignored masks little space people could made whole situation less dire. 

There's reason US protests past summer centers outbreaks.... WORE MASKS. been, so... Good job providing scientific counterpoints blabber really solidifying unnecessariness trading ideas emptiness you. Go ahead say something else stupid feel like today:  Oh didn’t realize long-term side effects already documented. cool Pfizer time machine. got worse lol wait December 31 instead implementing right away? public health agencies every western democracy conspiracy together say vaccines safe? I'm doctor think ever get vaccine ass 👏👏👏 Wow absolutely terrible series event went short amount time. Often? sure that? source? completely fine decision entitled make yourself. question lifting restrictions people know risks want return normal anyway, understanding happen high risk opportunity get vaccine avoid endangering based people's choices. tricky question one feel made everyone country safe, case we'd shut every winter avoid flu deaths, we'd suspend everyone's licenses avoid motor fatalities.

People die suffer awful, certain point every individual make choice play numbers game whether think they'll okay. want make decision remain cautious, that's fine, point people allowed make decisions contrary. disappointing pregnant women always told this. understand can't better studies women's bodies pregnancy breastfeeding. Almost anything, even minor painkillers, say something along lines ""we know bad baby"" almost testing. Women, especially pregnant women, often left medicine. wearing mask sacrifice? Wearing mask really sacrifice honestly. mild discomfort... that's it.

Lockdowns restrictions, that's another story.  Playing devil's advocate bit, vaccination COVID impossible (which looked like might possible early on) going back normal definitely *would* taken years. still first wave COVID. world without vaccination would continued coming waves like Spanish Flu, year year. guess Italy South Korea 0 infections right?

Being small island nation able close border entirely screen every incoming person perks time like this. doesn’t randomly break timed choreographed dance number coworkers time time? Yeah, might hitting numbers soon reduce capacity many places, doubt governor pull trigger.

There’s lot hospitals state already ICU capacity. Yes, get once. Dr thought might due shingles. mild case coincidentally right around time got Bell's. got shingles vaccine year later per instructions. guarantees get Bells's though.  thought going is...well....I really, really want to. force it, fuck em. I've right thing whole time. give fuck want, stay goddamn house. I'm wearing masks needs done.

But mean I'm denial means. Humans seeing others faces restriction. seeing smile ever leave house? seeing *any* facial expression able communicate anyone using face? 

Yeah, that's pretty big restriction. don’t agree 9/11 whatsoever. It’s embarrassing. 

But equating attack people people COVID doesn’t make much sense. That's next hurdle. seventy million people refuse take vaccine could dealing isolated outbreaks years. worked Amazon years. management one toxic ever. Masks fine. wear indefinitely needed. really see problem wearing masks.

Other restrictions though, much. remember russians shot commercial plane purpose? sputnik vaccine actually tested outside Russia? actually happened NYE. looked up. harbinger come sure. That’s say got imagine they’re reviewing initial data also. cutting enrollment may they’re seeing strong efficiency rate well. weren’t finding strong correlation typically would try gather data. assumption I’ve seen lot companies operate way past.  seems strange me. case extremely quickly spreading virus vaccine now, known spread primarily via airborne droplets. generally case, one would hope medical facilities would make ppe decisions based risk mitigation. clear substantial reduction typical conditions, know would permanent. Hundreds thousands people dead many people thought believing hard enough glass half full would make less empty.

Patience caution what's required. US alone already ""reopened"" like three times now, every time disastrous results. one thing optimistic. another thing naive. Thanks. lives military base Florida covid testing nurse. I'm surprised took long get sick. 

My dad seems ok despite age risk factors normally healthy sister seems struggling. old co-worker young healthy well. old ""weak"" people vulnerable. understand people given vaccine months ago right? side effects well documented.  Lmaooo greatest country world !!! Again, feel *should* happening totally irrelevant. need deal actually happening. can’t even take yet. It’s available public fully. Unfortunately, important wearing mask would people cold/flu wearing theirs. Unless got really good one, masks lot keep *spreading* illness getting it.

I really wish mask culture like East Asia, sick people would wear 'em protect others (or, know, *stay home*, that's another whole conversation poor non-existent sick leave workplaces). Gotta love months ago, November, Pfizer offered trump administration extra 400 million doses. aren’t gonna like answer US government gave them. Big fat NO. Unreal... it’s want go forever. truly don’t think mask mandates everywhere then. think lot places drop mandates summer enforce mask wearing high risk situations (like hospital long term care facility home) think means. believe Canada, US, UK perform proper due diligence? makes think that? Everytime visited grandmother would slip candy $5 bill. Guess always excited go see?

I’m totally going thing become grandpa.

Will bribing grandchildren liking me? Yes. okay that? Also yes. I'll wear mine cold. It'd nice others too. kids already give everything me, need sneezed people. :) hate people highlight race gender like this. EVER equality highlight OH LOOK WOMAN!!! OMG BLACK!!! would somehow impact brain capacity ability scientist. Come on.

Why say 'Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett' ... one leading figures help end pandemic! thought trumps position - none works willing act good faith.

Keep pretending lead anyone deciding take turned safe &amp; effective vaccine. Whatever takes justify choices life. course 100% certainty yet. difference way get without LOTS people needlessly dying suffering permanently preventable disease. always reason ""question,"" sorts things constantly despite evidence far showing safe, right reason think scare others taking vaccine. possible outcome hope achieve? think every single western public health agency conspiring give unsafe vaccines? keep changing goal posts. insulted person simply want wear mask rest life. hysterical. 

Yes, time leave house risk catching spreading disease. true pandemic, remain true after. want change way life fear catching flu, that's personal choice. us without untreated anxiety disorders go back normal life soon safe so. there's nothing wrong that. 😯 Theres literally evidence working. New Zealand, cases. No, island nothing it. I've accepted new uniform hospital clinical settings be, minimum, mask goggles. high risk areas, full PPE new normal - n85/N95 mask, face shield, plus PPE contact secretion/drainage precaution areas.

In society... I'm going keep wearing unless I'm around people who's contact history feel comfortable with. genuine question Politician something said always bothered me. (Hope get taken down). 

Why Kamala state would never take vaccine Trump president. thats exactly going right now. people vaccinated taking dangerous vaccine b/c trump president?

I point b/c always concerned comment. Trump presidency would give excuse millions Americans say well vaccine trump therefore dangerous. imagine. cant believe American people let comment slide dangerous always bothered me. alarmingly high rate mean couple case studies (not high quality form evidence) show heart scarring risks population (athletes) actually quite vulnerable anyway, fine. whole pre-screen farce.... 

If person taking personal responsibility point?

The screenings huge deterant reminder. yet see one case caught screen locally.  Mind im sure far amount man power put it?


There better way. Well, may well wrong that. I've real battles lately ""apocalypse brain."" still hope 2021 apocalyptic. 

I get coming from. I've tried look 2021 sort extension 2020. Personally, can't afford huge letdown, plus still many unknowns. SE Michigan, started tapering back weeks ago - even Costco day someone refused wear one kick out. Gas stations stopped requiring (most people wear inside now). Pretty sure everyone's going ride now. Ok lets lets take 9/11 then. hard facts. Thanks. I’m sure swampass 1 2 would agree well. multiple vaccines work backup. Like pfizer approved soon moderna hopefully January we'll get news johnson johnson. whole reason countries preordered doses mixture vaccines incase make incase there's delays one memory serves 2020 started Pope slapping someone. gonna lay there. bureaucracy, lobbies politics don’t run science. Scientists do. 

At end day, PhDs conducting trials, writing peer reviewed papers getting federal approvals (by PhDs) people take it. Politics can’t create vaccine without thousands PhDs reviewing tested thousands people. 

You question science want - go read papers. See studies conducted measured. work scientists, ultimately it’s whether believe bureaucracy, believe scientific community system works #1 scientific issue last century. early 2022-end prediction saw floating around no-vaccine/vaccine mid-2021 assumption, probably dig source like - pretty early rollout unreasonable experts move predictions up, mind Loooooooool said wanted wait 6 months see people react. 

You literally learn nothing. 6 months January you’re even going get vaccine. 

Nice try wiggling way previous dumb statements though. would require reasonable amounts sick leave. Nobody /wants/ go work sick, 5 (or zero) sick days year, gamble use unless seriously sick. believe Infinite Within, belief per se opens doors within allow EVER feel loneliness. Now, prove that?

In 5th century, St. Augustine Hippo said, ""I believe, therefore experience.""

About 700 years later, Duns Scotus said, reply, ""I experience, therefore believe.""

They seem completely contradictory. say right. Augustine right subjective things, Scotus right objective things. duality subjective objective beginning created world Non-Duality.

Science Way objective things. 

Spirituality Way subjective things.  Depends we're talking regarding normalcy. end ongoing national state emergency ICUs hospitals crammed? Going I've heard Fauci predict, he's right probably April. able personally go restaurant hang friends safety? Sometime spring early summer probably vaccines become widely available.  Masks basic social distancing? Probably going way dodo end year, slowly, depending vaccine adoption rates. 

Pesonally, I'm going fee like things returning normal soon vulnerable family members get vaccinated I'm constantly worrying going public. luck, that's far off. think lot. America could never band together war effort now. bunch entitled children. professional sports sense honor CEO Pfizer! get multiple tests hospital pharmacist never able tested. comes contact patients every day. still enough tests. doses vaccine. 50,000,000 doses 330,000,000 Americans gone quickly. Essentially autoimmune allergic reaction. Autoimmune encapsulating ton things. assumption affects deeply inaccurate unfortunate way exist. know might nicest person world, takeaway global pandemic devastated many people it’s harming care, you’re clearly interested part world meaningful way. Yep. accepted job company working ""in office"" despite best practices necessary. assumed would least following preventative measures. Nope. office full 40-50 strangers, single person wearing mask two three weeks worked there.

Long story short, called OSHA filed report. company decided part ways paid contract full. Come on. Wearing mask sacrifice. different wearing shoes hat head. minor clothing accessory. wish people would stop acting like torture device.

See stores signs ""No Shoes. Shirt. service."" ? deal. hygiene safety others.

Better ease gradually risk flare up. Plus also know yet extent immunity. get stuff figured out, better safe. Obviously able meet family close friends vaccinated. wear mask then. get confirmation thing behind us, wear damn mask general public. too. knew people west could never handle virus. Moderna's delivering 100ug mRNA, Pfizer 30ug. liposomes also exactly same, delivery efficiency different.

There's also chance moderna pfizer (or vice versa) added short mRNA sequence better target spike MHC immune display. good reason, Oxford vaccine based decade research development 2003 sars-coronavirus. uses traditional well known approach using modified, attenuated adenovirus. Pfizer’s Moderna’s mRNA vaccines first kind. Back July, wasn’t clear vaccines would work best (or all), government spread investment around (i.e. keeping eggs basket). Also US option purchasing 500 million doses Pfizer’s vaccine. take time Pfizer produce first batch 100 million. time US next order place prioritized (The US mandate vaccines produced US stay US).  thing note 62% effectiveness still good (and may significantly higher using half dose, full dose protocol). consider impact population level, individual level. Crudely simplistically (population dynamics much complex example assumes sterilizing immunity), consider would take person infected person A. virus jump person B C D. 62% blockage per person, means person 5% chance original chance infection person A. herd immunity works well. Even lower effectiveness vaccines powerful way. Germs healthy yeah, fools fly Nashville now. Ah ok, potentially week. That's shame, hopefully get approved sooner rather later, hope speed process vaccines well! “Won’t choice”

That’s really true. least US hasn’t much government push mask mandates. It’s pretty much individual places set enforce mask rules. There’s going much bigger fight people claim they’ve vaccine. there's demon sperm it? Nowhere near carve dick nosers antimaskers missed spot boots, loser. Get useless mouth back licking. Omg too. resort nobody wearing masks suddenly thought, “This isn’t right.” realized needed go grab mine. Took forever get there. dream ended. So? I'm still right still wrong whether wrong people win not. People remember traitors were. using China check people going buses building. tell person fever hopefully person realizes sick going world. forget sarin gas attacks Syria death Nelson Mandela. Yes I’m taking chances loved ones mine health. I’m J&amp;J trial! Excited see does. So.... feeling 2021? Asking friend..... \*naught sorry doc. needle goes ass, i'm done mask. Yes, useless. One inch difference distance makes 10 plus degrees difference tried % strange inflammation/bell's palsy statistically low among human trials within first couple months vaccine ok. 4.4% rare. 4.4% planes crashed, would say rare? 4.4% people vaccinated ended transverse myelitis, would say rare? point comparison, 1% flu cases 50-64 year olds (an older cohort) result hospitalization. Medically speaking, rare defined &lt;1%. agree see slowdown deaths elderly vaccinated, see dramatic decrease February cases explode, OP suggested. Yes, mRNA though. Okay.. Okay. Could Frosty baked potato please. Don’t mean rude, science isn’t supposed based show confidence. I’m phase 3 trial covid vaccine believe may received real one, placebo, maybe weigh in.

Try keep mind can’t force someone getting vaccine don’t feel comfortable it. said, would let know think get would help protect family, happy *you* would know she’s protected. Tie much love care would also help relieve stress worrying passing virus around family members. Maybe could also remind passes chance get vaccine everyone else might wait long time gets another opportunity get vaccine, weeks maybe even months.


It’s 4 months since got vaccinated feel fine. She’ll fine well. Might feel little tired “blah” getting vaccinated it’s totally worth it. I’ve following Balloux Twitter, understand, means natural decline pandemic coincide rollout vaccines, meaning vaccines big impact ending pandemic early would’ve rolled earlier. don’t think means covid crisis finished deployment vaccines, think OP concerned mean cool! Personal choice. I’d rather want die enjoy life/see faces take risk catching cold. I’d rather sick occasionally lock-downed face covering public. Rawr! takes year vaccinate everybody?

They're going need 4x many vaccinators then. majority wrong? Give up? Thats get Nazi Germany. no, forcing people *not* kill people equal fascism people forced *to* kill people. understand concern, worth noting long term side effects vaccines extremely rare. Part reason they're comfortable giving EUA precisely reason. There's much precedent it.

Also, understand, mRNA based vaccine tech new year. already used develop customized cancer treatments last years clinical trials. Question, people virus since built antibodies fight it, deemed safe now, BUT, still can’t smell taste? vaccine(s) help that? drove 10-15 mins away thanksgiving total nine people. Getting virus worse vaccine. here. People know dying now. forgot scientist past literally get infected tested cure prove worked;

Probably few, notable [Barry proved *H. Pylori* caused stomach ulcers. Nobel Prize that. second point fucked qll year. processing disorder rely lipreading facial expressions fill gaps sentences. I've harder time hearing people say can't read lips 😢 thing 62% isn’t even it. average 70%, 90% doses differently DIES  Well people lost livelihoods starving/losing homes. Yeah I’d rather take chances point worked/owned business industry. feel bad, family rough 2019 along couple family tragedies towards end. time wait 2020, thinking new year would surely calmer. wrong too. Yeah, workman's comp without clearly defined, witnessed, reportable, well documented incident nightmare. Probably not.  deny virus dangerous? denigrate public health officials? advocate wearing mask? I'll bet three true. praying members death cult. are, know retail pharmacist whose entire job next week vaccinating folks nursing homes. Thank god saved money. irresponsible, misleading, panic-baiting headline. Fuck CNBC. mid / late 2021 seems optimistic ask okay, great source, thanks waste time say lot word word trick. Ah, good. Finally, we’re getting hold thing clear clicking through, vaccines would impact pandemic would end regardless, likely summer 2021. Skepticism whole fucking point science. everyone would still think world flat center universe. Why? science said so!! QUESTIONED.

If trust science time 110% picked wrong thing do. ***The whole point science questioning already know.***  100% safe? safer getting virus? yeah does, states give grocery store workers elderly..I going disagree Best luck parents. good news among first get vaccinated said. 

And even they’re not, there’s harm outdoor masked visit something. Mental health also problem, it’s one reasons COVID spreading: people can’t take anymore, give end getting infected.

But we’ve got end sight, we’ve got hold little longer. you’re wealthy country, second half year (Or maybe even 2nd quarter) far better.

Sincerely, edgy teenager. thing easier convince people take regular approved ""emergency"" approved. released 5 months ago, think people would trusted properly tested? Yeah hindsight’s 2020 Q1 2020? going Trump timeline? I'm sure does. America,where pay exorbitant monthly fees insurance pay little less doctor depending doctor see done. Maybe coverage major surgery. Maybe used network provider. Maybe already used full insurance year whatever. hard say, there's plenty ways insurance companies fight provide service pay for.

Sadly,this headline common US. difference white house official. Thousands people resort crowd funding medical expenses goes radar. efficacy J&amp;J vaccine candidate? amazing thing Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective are- 94% give take. parties Newsom though Wearing mask changes ton humans interact person. Much communication involves non-verbal visual cues, mostly lost mask. simply conversation difficult mask. Physical attraction limited. go on. Now, restrictions worth virus killing thousands. However balance shifts talking much smaller numbers next year Moderna's CEO take it? Oh my! I'm sorry.  Why? Seems like vaccinated risk contracting virus almost nil. me, becomes incumbent non-vaccinated\* manage risk point. I'm going go restaurant anything risky I'm vaccinated, point bets off. 

\* know insignificant segment can't vaccinated, I'm sure there. I'm referring people choose wait. going lose fight btw. Totally makes sense! Good luck vaccine crunching numbers. presume seen correlation doesn’t equal causation website etc? Sounds like load crap, honestly.

He one person. gonna cause block. bet lot people willing let humble CEO take spot ahead them.

I forgot scientist past literally get infected tested cure prove worked; CEO stop making excuses go take damn vaccine. I'm sorry. sounds like would amazing year. Heart conditions, cognitive health, respiratory health, nervous system damage. Nobody sure surface. Back 50s rushed polio vaccine source outbreak caused death paralysis children. he’s President yet absolute dipshit. sounds awesome! 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, cool would able tell kids safe Santa everyone's health/lives social distancing properly, he's keeping technology still able part children's Christmases, Santa's set special/specific video call children? know put kid's shoes imagine that'd pretty damn awesome happen Christmas, whether global pandemic.  


It's safer everyone involved, money still change hands services rendered, really seems like win/win situation me. I'm little envious kids! mean, yeah ""people bought houses though pandemic would never end"" pretty low totem pole folks struggle whole thing end. There's going *far* people struggling return 'normalcy' psychologically thanks agoraphobia, social anxiety, issues developed worsened past year. know personally, whole thing started working actively best *get outside* put get PTSD/social-anxiety. year ""don't go outside might catch horrible disease spread family!"" pretty firmly reset progress I'd made front, I'm going really struggle getting back there. Uhh we've known since get-go, no? forced wear mask PAST date absolutely necessary restriction. wear 8+ hours work. It’s super uncomfortable hate feeling face (I OCD) constant reminder abnormal lives now. I’d like see expression able understand customers. one likes it. can’t smile communicate way. It’s completely depressing tell customers wear (I don’t feel get paid enough that). Telling wear even majority pop vaccinated (and immunity developed) ridiculous. I’ve seen people say permanent. Take whichever vaccine offered. Jesus Christ, pandemic. fuck opioids anything we’re talking vaccine?

I don’t know I’m trying reason someone like you. I’d recommend looking get idea pandemic may end epidemiologically US, reassuring: Models never perfect, guy’s models accurate most.

Also, know social end pandemic epidemiological end pandemic necessarily coincide, better worse Sorry mean say majority health workers dislike vaccine. best I've seen 50/50, generally opinions skew towards pro-mRNA; fact 17-4 shows professionals also voicing valid concerns around mass human trials new tech.

And yea traditional vaccines developed, scale Pfizer Moderna, think might better choice. i'm stupid include infected herd immunity goal, America get there. one doesn’t require much low temperature storage. True spreading...I thinking angle catching it...where rise would nil vaccinated. problem spring pandemic law individually target lockdown business facility would closed down. issue national lockdown using law would probably impossible due overhead. Maybe. Anywhere go though people still masks don’t distance themselves. It’s like getting touched either, mask still big difference. able wear masks restaurants, hope learn lower max capacity turn music down. Every restaurant SF/NYC/LA/Chicago notorious this. can't even hear think. I'd happily pay meal. understand this, country full people yet cases stopped. control measures? Naw. People never learn. care hygiene person next them. long party get drunk grind girls club, that's matters. Um, that's Pfizer Moderna vaccines works.

You may want bit research making decision false incomplete information. fine, masks okay, long universal distancing picture Q3 2021 Staff needed Yep, someone personally responsible, they're almost worth wasting test them. Can't tell who'd change behavior lab confirmed positive, though. crazy ass anti-mask covid-19-is-a-hoax assholes I've seen, doubt it. sick assclowns. mention hospitals free significantly. That’s going happen, especially general public gotten vaccine. I’m even speaking personal perspective, I’m saying least US, it’s going happen. hard part finding antigen that's relatively unchanging accessible immune system. Rna vaccines really help though potentially could faster turn around. could see used update vaccine real time rather per flu season.

More traditional ""universal"" flu shots also development. learned rushing vaccines proven fatal before. changed saying get stadiums back like last week. Yeah I'm always shocked see masks mentioned breath things here. Yeah especially hate argument “it’s small sacrifice” would agree right pandemic it’s quite big deal continue covering face everywhere go. Also holy fuck ears hurt lot /s? Could tell us previous vaccines long term negative health outcomes? I'd interested hear folks expect covid vaccine go long term negative outcomes. Nope. I’ll 6 months information Yes that’s there’s almost 6m vaccine doses US right 2.9m vaccinated it. 

And later estimates provided assuming that. Two orders 100m Moderna one order 100m Pfizer means 150m people vaccinated. Hello South Africa. many kids die travelling school? Could avoid deaths mandating home schooling? Yes, would fuck economy, reduce educational, attainment, harm mental health, increase poverty domestic abuse.

Right now, Covid huge problem deserves support attention it’s getting. However, Covid deaths rare school bus deaths, measures supposed take don’t causes? That's probably low estimate chance dying. chance getting infected likely much much higher living positivity rate anything low single digits. sad, Oxford one always destined developing world. IR ""thermometers"" subject potentially high variance (relative scale, acceptable variance circumstantially) due variable emissivity materials distance target. Generally, types devices take spot reading average entirety sensor resolution. far linear; spot increases diameter farther aperture target, thereby increasing arbitration measurement (in case, interference hair make-up, etc, anything telling core temp comes sampling field greatly reduced accuracy). However, _this true non averaging resolution infrared emission_, human software make much better determination ""seeing"" image displaying measuring converted infrared emission surface temperature. emissivity factor absolutely crucial accuracy usability infrared determining 'black body temperature; different material composition even surface finish differences material greatly vary effective long wave emissivity.

So, fast sanitary way taking subjects temperature, potentially wildly inaccurate. depend highly operator, exact design IR sensor lensing combination, software/hardware corrections closed loop systems (such fixed calibration laser automatically provide emissivity factor device, expensive, uncommon arguably impractical). 

I use mid-grade IR camera good deal project work. operate something like -100F 1000F (I remember exactly ATM), still accurate narrow band temperature. take small area minimum temperature dynamics ∆, proper emissivity factor applied entire reading, take accurate measurements (product docs say ⅒ degree F, would go beyond ⅓ degree F, IMOAE).

One critical presumption make vast majority sensor guns see use shittiest $10 bulk guns using 20 year old designs. Even damn case molding same. likely using low manufacturing cost IR CMOS solid state onboard interpolating averaging across low resolution CMOS matrix, introducing imperfections narrow range. types configurations acceptable flash measuring thing need be, say ±2°F wide temperature range, application core temp person animal, hardly rung arbitrary factor independent variables mix. _Just there's confusion, high grade proper QCd IR 'guns', common see super cheap ones used allegedly 'critical' narrowband measurements._

In personal opinion, experience engineer data scientist, best option taking quick, accurate core temp samples would utilize one high resolution IR cameras, utilize data off-board processing local emissivity calculations multiple sample sites. Basically, using single (or more, it'll get really expensive quickly) aperture system either take measurements multiple people across moderately large area pick high relative absolute temperatures, using sensor system one person time, latter could accurate, time consuming going mf-ing TSA airport.

Yeah, sorry essay, really grinds bad way see multi billion dollar corporations deploy handful $10 tools, entities turn around say public/customer safety priority. _Safety number one subject applied cost basis, ever_ putting crappy tools potentially useless arbitrary improve issue, feel-good band-aid.

All aside, bigger issue _still_ high percentage carriers _zero symptoms_. even fever; way they'd even know carriers 2-3 positive tests. (Prob one PCR low amplification antibody test, that's field officially. I'm medicine although work healthcare/pharmaceuticals.) whole thing mess continue foreseeable future. Oh c'mon! Look him! Oh fine, let's pray something important like chocolate. It’s gross. want force everyone forever don’t want wear one active pandemic killer grandmas immunocompromised. It’s getting ridiculous. Life risk. It’s “a tiny sacrifice” wear months ever year job 8+ hour day find uncomfortable depressing. I’ll wear pandemic over. People don’t care pandemic seems, pushing new normal others taken ""your"" vaccine? 20202020 vision, Cupid hit Cupid hit precision Definitely staff cold flu season could also extend patients. It’d reasonable assume hospitals would say “hey, learned lot transmission communicable diseases pandemic it’d make sense anyone coming building full sick people need wear mask you’re here.”

Edit: fear forced wear mask keeping going hospital, got anywhere right now? Bc required everywhere. Also, wearing piece cloth really much encumbrance? I'm... ""Actually""... Pretty ... ""Progressive""... Too... 100 thousands acceptance vaccine suffers procedure changed faster approval

But suffer? Majority people willing take vaccine countries I've seen, last week increasing everywhere. they've turned TV off, might missing important information. hand, they're also missing disinformation, they're better some! according downvotes :( lol apologies joke! thing missing bringing COVID flu level although 18 year old COVID always higher IFR 18 year old influenza,but eliminate high risk folks COVID, drop total IFR roughly influenza IFR since still get lot old folks dying influenza every year.

As total deaths, that's going matter getting vaccinations enough people eventually roughly (or less) COVID-19 deaths.

And while, yes, agree put enough effort behind containing flu, that's standard disease needs really care mostly let run course. offer vaccines recommend people stay home, requiring vaccination participation society requiring masks September March every work time doesn’t come hospitalizations

Yes, know this. talking productivity economy, there's LOT variables stake dropping protections sooner rather later **may** right thing do.

My reasoning asking hospitilization rates 50s time hospitilization figure high push case rates talking 90%+ young healthy folks without overloading hospitals.

Now, obviously we've strayed incredibly far point hand.

Fauci's full statement fact vaccines public health impact least several months’. may public health impact protecting individual people. public health impact, likely **several months get full positive impact** vaccine.

The highlighted sentence differs greatly headline portion. one thing say get full positive impact several months, seem controversial that's point, sure. think inaccurate say see public health impact several months. Ok ok. like. exactly conservatives yelling about? soon Biden elected virus magically goes away? Sure, seen massive amount reporting phenomenon earlier year, sports fan heard healthy athletes getting testing hospitals running tests... go Yes am, distinction reddit SM. Yeah I’m injecting cov-19 directly body. appreciate willing risk plunge unknown. many doses U.S. getting? think we've learned nothing vaccine R&amp;D past 70 years? Denmark despite 2 months lockdown similar incidence terms infections Sweden. destroyed people livelihoods businesses still suffering badly. clear lockdown impact many people aim for. right answer. can’t find anything he’s said virus yet, accused sexual misconduct 3 female students.[David Byrd seek re-election There's reason he's saying it. People intelligences putting fingers ears saying, ""lalala, goal posts moving, I'm vaccinated done part, muh rights/freedom/life, et cetera."". talk ""think everyone"" bullshit moment know vaccinated  various vaccines long time effects. Feel like he's stating facts. He's pretty good staying neutral stating facts, matter much American people dissappoint him. saying can't meet within social bubble vaccinated. house party vaccinated buddies. general public, wear mask. Nobody forcing take it, literally never happen  Social distancing way bigger impact masks did. Remove social distancing keep masks truly see degree prevent flu transmission. forget brexit response! that’s absolutely wrong number levels. First kids don’t need vaccine likely won’t get next 6-12 months. knock 150m needed doses amount. Second, JNJ AZ’s production capabilities massive. Even JNJ ends working we’re still ok. Third, there’s need vaccinate population get herd immunity. need maybe 60% vaccinated less seriously make feel like it’s pandemic. 

America needs, conservatively, 250m people vaccinated. get 100m needed first three orders Pfizer Moderna June (two Moderna one Pfizer). Hopefully JNJ approved new round Pfizer Moderna then, we’re good. even assuming AZ approved. Don’t expect to. hate wearing 8 hours day work. love wearing lipstick seeing faces. Masks remind horrible times drive crazy sensation. don’t care people wear would wear sick hate people saying need cause easily save lives! could never leaving house, would safer everyone. don’t like living world. please say forever. experts full shit. Another MD on[Meet talking still get infected spread disease, even 2 doses. 

So happened 94% effectiveness? longer applicable?  find remarkable specialist saying this. Yea right point. It’s enough non-racist , actively anti-racist Couldnt even get many vote trump sooo bit better 10 fold less average year.

I'm delighted that. feared almost change travel.

I still worry families close thus travel. hopefully celebrate similar numbers.. we're close finish line! Lets finish strong. ill take vaccine mcnugget form highly effective, need second vaccine for? 5 months ago properly tested, trials completed, exactly argument. People likely get thousands people around vaccinated fine. willingness take vaccine already increasing many countries. Unless solid research supports 3 weeks delay approving vaccine massively increases acceptance (spoiler: research), argument hold. 80 year olds people simple don’t matter much kids. think density overall population. TX spread big cities California that’s point view. Yeah means co-workers might tease talking funny droopy face awhile. Mask use continue indefinitely people sick venturing public. Exactly. family friends vaccinated, get together, fun, wear mask. general public, put damn mask. really hard. know considered torture device. Hell, countries use time public. think bad idea. UAE supposedly saw 90+% effectiveness. guy makes $133,155 year, pay fucking fact, part reason numbers high due experts telling Swedish public epidemic basically over?

There's lots European countries currently worse Sweden, I'm really sure draw conclusion. *new* movies, anyways. May-June range prob popular opinion around point Gods, must really adversity life think wearing piece fabric difficult get vaccine terrible. know telling people say never received vaccine? good look all. shows ignorant are. totally agree saying see problem governments media portrayed holy grail would end all? imagine telling people, btw know actually going prevent spreading lol. People going feel like lied disregard it. system have. hospital worm received first vaccine shipment yesterday town hall meeting morning attended. language used moment vaccine ""prevents symptomatic infection"" 95% recipients. everyone working assumption transmit vaccination. But, like said, open question everyone hoping data come we'll find least less likely transmit it. least Covid-19 /s yeah made clear. i'm fearmongering would love get back outside come summer - *will* outside next summer lmao, ass wants go camping - even 1st world countries time distribute vaccines going eclipse entirely lengths past pandemics Belgian government: lol article bullshit. Yes, co-worker develop viral infection couple years ago. affected months went away. guy also constant infections hospitalize get adequate sleep ever. guess either underlying undiscovered genetic issue predisposes severe infections inflammation fact sleep. Either way, he's probably head scratcher doctors think majority population would risk this. understand 46 kids aged 5-14 died covid entire country since beginning right?

The risk children realllly close zero. 

Now still issue potentially bringing home separate concern. downvoted idiot actually. Yeah I’d rather catch flus colds sit wear mask university, never party go bars. live cold climate I’m miserable now. liked wearing lipstick seeing faces/expression. Im sick called selfish saying don’t want wear mask unless I’m sick Covid over. It’s supposed pandemic measure. hate wearing 9 hours work would way rather prefer getting sick cold. afraid keep don’t mandate guilt trip me. I'm surprised discussed more. possible almost 1/3 country infected. Combine natural immunity (but long) vaccinations, bet numbers plummet late Spring. removing longterm burden vaccine (s) thousands daily. Short/midterm burden huge however. Moderna coming week. mention Jansen, maybe Oxford next 2-3 months. also think we're going see mRNA's potentially prevent transmission substantial way.. ignore fact Canada still 73% white. still largely homogenous country despite language differences. population different ignored well.

That's reality US needs adopt EU type model. Break US around 5 different countries. 5 different countries Canada could form EU type model still free trade partnerships economic development defense. 5 different countries former US could still use American dollar similar EU countries use Euro. 

The reality US simply become big governed effectively. would great evidence behind theories. I'll find satanic microchips elsewhere then. Fine. Thats assuming enough people take vaccine.  Many counting days till moratorium ends. Another kind terror Fauci known giving best case scenarios. He's conservative estimates said himself. Gotta go w public health officials man unfortunate, one logical fallacies people make lack recognition inaction action. opposite implicitly true: getting vaccine, actively taking chances loved ones, own, health. family member mine lawyer dedicated room house fo goods stockpile, ran bought gun (was previously anti gun), hoarded toilet paper, took money bank, keeping hundreds thousands dollars house. beginning pandemic. Four months later acting like Covid big deal, elderly parents law fly house every holiday. 

I don’t trust people think anymore. all. I'm tired ""Can't win either way, comments.""

His ass needs take vaccine lmao. hard. might die/get injured biking. People heart attacks marathoning. Everything life risk. things want would enjoyable mask. wear mask prevent COVID, never get cold again. I’m sure already young fun since 48, longer care things. people require emergency care dying ambulances waiting space dead people hospital rooms morgue full. (these already happening)

No they're not. Satan? Get weak shit here. want Flying Spaghetti Monster chip! guinea pigs given 5 months ago. Ah bad lol. Fixed. Well obviously form resistance movement. skeptical success. super-symptomatic know? Thank you. think suggestion elderly care homes may correct. article says women took care elderly disabled 16% prevalence. women interacts many vulnerable people, care home, could end much higher numbers cases people highest risk death would skew IFR calculations.

Another possibility tests may sensitive enough may getting false negatives people infected back spring whose antibody levels declined (though likely remain high enough protect infection). Moderna really fascinating firm around 1,000 employees. vaccine would first product they’ve ever commercially approved FDA. it’s obviously historic approval. 

Interesting read time (this 2016) - Sounds right, American people way. Masks infringe freedom, what's deaths right? /s. 
 
The chance getting thick headed conservatives United States numbers seems, even death refuse believe Coronavirus hoax. selfish society. wasn’t magic, Donald still president. 😐 Ok according you, never allowed go concerts again, right? Got keep moving goalposts. Fast forward 6 months we'll hearing need 95% vaccinated order reopen outdoor dining California. Depending position grocery store is, size is, might risky. work one, spend day alone department.

That said, understand point always easy leave one's job. there's pretty big difference qualifications pay thing sure, always factor. non-factor people. 

You depression people challenging human empty, enough? wear mask 15 minutes week grocery shopping. travel car. go nature, - country - masks complusory. even were, see anyone could force alone there. Yes, willing forgo anything, means avoid spending time mask. That’s CVS Walgreens. I’d love provide others there’s guarantee would doses given vaccine I’m next month expect hold wait guaranteed dose. You’re getting vaccine? know several points make. Thank information. First off, bells palsy lethal. (Setting aside one died shots all)

So tell veracity ""report"" read.


The incidence bells palsy vaccination groups background population. concern there's imbalance cases compared control. anything alarmed at. much population country needs vaccinated achieve herd immunity? know it’s causation? months vaccination. know it’s obviously low risk unlikely causing Bell’s palsy I’m curious. Junior year really best. dorms worry much post-college life senior year volunteer guinea pig? wearing mask may families exposed putting danger. Disturbing realize it. remember reddit users literally children pretty similar disabled adults. either never worked worked sandwich maker subway assume managers spend 90% time playing minesweaper 10% abusing fun. think everyone lives rural farms Canada?!

Yes quite tightly packed LA, much much closer California South Dakota, example. based traditional model, even back March knew would faster super heathy, I’m also 48, high end endurance athlete. race 100 mile mountain bike races 4 5 times year. don’t want cold, flu, COVID. Maybe do.

Maybe you’ll shake off, maybe won’t.  Uh, people shout music loud spread Covid. known phenomenon. people cannot wait stop wearing masks. wear to, mask wearing period would like put behind them. remind people Covid. good memory. non emergency care cancelled Stockholm free manpower. bet won’t offered vaccine till April enough time rare side effects show millions getting vaccine month. Vaccine side effects always show first months. plan keeping desk hand co-workers stayed home I'm sniffling next winter.  Exactly! Going dinner/drinks booking flights need. Masks fine! freshman year college shit, thinks that's best year social life Sweden average around 6k infection per day vs 3k Denmark. Sweden approx. twice Danish population, sort numbers...one country lockdown 2 months, still sort normality. I'm waiting take vaccine prevents bringing home. right fucking now? something important do? Fatigue, headache, muscle pain, hmm, that's ideal. Clearly side effects. 

Does seem worse permanent lung, nerve vein damage? Oh forgot Brain fog loss smell. 

Hmm, one would rather have?  Driver testing safe gets. maybe. maybe. vaccine rushed processed much faster vaccines use today, coupled fact companies mad eit pursuing LAIBILITY WAIVERS long term side effects means maybe can’t sure won’t long term side effects Obama helped increase willingness. local newspaper asking people Facebook whether take vaccine. half saying no. live Trump county. people fucking stupid. literally never try forecast year go again. first time life look happens... 2021 better... Please.. honesty, admit hugely prejudiced russia. find hard believe anything backed government. Might fair, although thank bad track record. would take sputnik thingy. 

I think one months time come countries better actually getting enough vaccines getting people. approvement confounding factor. 
But moment, find extremely frustrating seeing countries starting vaccinate we're sitting, waiting. happens people can't get second dose choose to? significant percentage people get one shot vaccines. (More 1% significant imo)  “The White House version Covid relief bill last week included $600 stimulus checks, Congress appears moving forward without them.”

Is anyone shocked this? space relatively fine. guess may part reason second wave degree expected. excuse lack preparation, though. missed that. Thank noticing pointing out! 
So third population willing get now. read news article half healthcare workers polled Miami said *not* getting it, makes sense would lower general population. know..I bet Oxford vaccine first successful one reasons. knew based research SARS vaccine. 
I'm saying unfortunate one world ordered effective others cause production issues successful ones. Anybody old enough remember Wow
Potato chips? side effects. nothing. Well that's evolution works. Got get picture need overcome changes made future generations resistance immunity. See: bacteria resistant antibiotics. sort vaccine thread controversial see TON people willing take vaccine immediately... Another thing you’re missing *we flu vaccines* people choose use protect themselves. effective reducing severity symptoms hospitalizations. COVID vaccines look effective yet, available everyone. soon! you’re asking tens thousands people die potentially many, many risk long-term health effects disease could choose protect half year we’re unwilling use societal-level protection mechanisms? attack rate asymptomatic infection households something like 0.7%. I’ll link post another sub find it.

[Here ya go. vaccine provides stable antibodies better immune response overall average infection, think it’s safe say possibly less worry asymptomatic spread post vaccine. There's many false negatives tests make good idea even testing beforehand. Follow local pharmacies, doctors, county health dept instagram/twitter etc. stay abreast prioritization soon happens. time, look like Wisconsin announced priority high risk individuals. One would think would spread easily nursing homes institutionalized populations facilities would point presumably cautious general population. Spain separate deaths care facilities? wet bed? mean happen w flu shot too. Many people taken it, hasn't. Magic nothing it. got Bella Palsy 8 years ago. Never fully resolved. regained around 85% facial movement, suffer hemifacial spasm synkenisis. muscles right side face atrophied. inflammation also damaged trigeminal nerve left dealing trigeminal neuralgia. It’s changed life good way. wasn’t big deal foe you, doesn’t mean that’s case everyone. might pessimist seeing stimulus passing. Market often time optimistic actually happen. No, vaccines anything repair cellular damage done. long term effects caused persistent infections. Eh...he'll fine. sniffles. Someone probably over-reacted put ventilator. could probably breathe fine really wanted to. masks thrown away. That's works....

Hospitals still seeing high recovery rates going ICUs. Reducing fatalities said ICUs actually make matters worse also reducing spread.

If 10 beds, full patient takes 15 days recover 10 days die, every 2 deaths, squeeze another person ward. 100% recovery still 15 days, lost effective bed space. I'm grim math checks out. die faster survivor recovers, reducing death toll means fewer beds overall spread contained.

In fact, saying 60 need vaccinated would make things soooo much worse lockdowns would end, cases surge hospitals get overwhelmed 3% fatalities 60. work factory socal man people dropping like flies. case community transmission super strict masks distancing. Alcohol spray bottles hand sanitizer everywhere. Every conference room turned extra break rooms distancing. man people willing big gatherings around holidays. Satan's microchips! get one them, vaccines going contain thing? disappoint.  pandemic still actively raging, can't deem lives ""saved"" sometime later 2021. OK Mr. reality-based intelligent people person, answer questions posed? currently effort requisition field hospitals, military medics, even rehire healthcare workers laid spring (I know few, still work ""health care worker shortage"")? efforts made spring hospital crunch (thankfully) actually materialize, supposedly really bad efforts made revitalize this?

Further, since incredibly intelligent sure yourself, perhaps could go explain hospitals overflowing tents barely even made news 2018, certainly point seen crisis, thing happening field hospitals constructed instead wholesale shutdowns entire hospitality industry (unsuccessful) effort keep people getting sick thus overwhelming hospitals?

If indeed believer logic evidence, questions trivially easy answer. rarely make time get flu shot year bet ass I'd get line midnight wait 6 hours Covid vaccine waiting end it.  dream could normalize mask wearing US, forget raw dogging people's nasty ass breath. One good things come along literal creation new type vaccine. Time find job without crazy people. Please don't. There's reason to, taking away someone needs it. potentially giving increasing worsening reactions body ramps response. People like pointing thing extra deadly old people exactly spares young. 

6 times flu 

on average guy says tested negative COVID

If test results accurate covid first visits, probably first however-many. surprised creator god-awful ""Saving Christmas"" movie behind this? think minute places run hospital resources, ""99 percenters"" come around bodies start piling literally anything requires ICU care. 

Hopefully people can't still clueless people require emergency care dying ambulances waiting space dead people hospital rooms morgue full. (these already happening)

I faith mask vaccination seem horrible then. medical data team analyzed detailed vaccine reports much larger many peer reviews. data team supplies information outside board vote Thursday. additional group effectively another peer review. large scale peer reviews much bigger process take six months would kill hundreds thousands. Oh sorry, parts united states demographic ""trust scientific authority"" anyone comes kinds things (vaccines). 

I feel like worded way simply speak directly people. (I assume since saying trust believe nothing it, right right that's it, etc).  semi-pro symptomatic something like 50 times flu parents I'm gonna wear mask? 

Get here. Everyone wear mask. 

This sub judgy. Read math. average screws old people lot people believe doesnt touch young all. point 2020 over. think meant 2021. Sorry bad joke. American EU: US lot things better EU never know media dominated bad American news. Actually lot big “problems” American COVID response also issues EU but, again, American platform. 

Prime example: Everyone knew Germany big trouble beginning October chancellor wanted shut then. didn’t happen because, much like US, Germany collection states COVID regulations individual states, federal German government. states refused hard lockdown instead came slightly different approaches “lockdown light.” obviously bad idea can’t Christmas we’re lockdown longer harder would fall. Supply chain issues. vaccines= quicker stabby stabs.

More vaccines = chance someone allergic one get other. issue first phase 3 trial accidentally messed dosage data mess unusable. Why? hell can’t it? demand everyone else want? problem technology, said affordability. number HVAC strategies make buildings healthier. Humidification, high ventilation rates, high efficiency filtration important. soon pandemic ends people forget go back designing systems around first cost. invented vaccine that's effective something killed millions worldwide, created many long termers, unpopular opinion: deserve cut head line reserve two shots distribute millions upon millions. earned it. Shut dumb ass moron  Oh, one making ignorantly flippant remark? I’m currently nursing school. pharmacy school drop prior mental health. never tried reapplying back pharmacy school, nursing school, it’s crazy different curriculum is. Nursing school basically focuses people’s symptoms. Pharmacy school medical school focus science behind someone feeling symptoms. nursing school student, agree. I’ve pretty suspect people class. Also, pharmacy school literally 1029272x harder nursing. Public opinion thing matters. Look assholes still wearing masks. acceptable answer far find scary people emphasis obvious. It’s like saying “I proclaim belief sun rises east” Yeah, drone strike assassins cost effective less traceable? Even bubonic plague ended...it took shit ton people(1/3rd europes population) die stop. 

One thing thats sure “Normal” aint gonna like before. world changing event. 911 changed world, 100 times bigger that. going new normal, fuck knows like. 

Theres also nothing stopping anotger pandemic cropping up. Weve come close things like Sars past. Theres also reason whatever next pandemic isnt signifigantly contagious, even lethal. virus like corona every capability say 30% mortality rate 2 week asymptomatic incubation. pure fucking luck one “only” 1% mortality. ehole situations going cause every government reassess pandemics national security threat. saw 911, knows stuff governments around world this. That's life. screened every morning. first sign possible symptoms tested sent home results back.

I constant runny nose frequent cough, tested least month. way could said hurt feelings? Yup. NFL office might not. way billionaire owners aren’t going buy vaccines protect assets. makes business sense. That's almost hospitals operating. Source: mom COO hospital. friend works travelling salesman told company requiring get resume normal travel work. Oooh *hard* S. Like aunt said: want start flying again, like direct flights, like change 5 planes. want hug lick everyone airport.  waiting watching...hope turn around another Thalidomide. ever hear country origin vaccines? Nearly half million dead US alone idiots blinded percentages refuse see actual, horrifying, numbers. UK US emergency approval. EU {conditional market guess that's takes longer. Feel like definitely emergency, I'm sure right choice.  Nope. I'm kind perplexed awful lot people seem think do. vaccines proven nothing prevent severe symptoms developing. young healthy, there's point getting develop one stops transmission. lie about?

Please elaborate. I'm hear  Seems like lost cause. Irrational people could see live stream vaccination claim really vaccine. They'll believe whatever feel true, trying get see reality futile.   Oh ok then.

Bye bye surprised many nurses anti-science. Oh, definitely hand make situation severe enough get Florida vaccines  Liar. Get life loser call reasonable people? turn ""yes, I'll take turn"" ""not taking medicine"" reasonable...... Hahaha nope keep running insane comments 🤣🤣.

Pleaaw elaborate even though shouldnt given every restriction lifted Nah, pretty obvious looking fight. So, bye I'm sorry, explain again, I'm hoping point brought up...

Why want cancel international sporting event going century I'm current form? matter no.

If takes first 2 responses:

1: steals vaccine ones need it, monster! See, rich people think themselves

2: vaccine got placebo anyhow

&amp;#x200B;

And takes later: something wrong mean watching 100,000 people phase 2 3 studies wasnt 3enough? Science trust science, unscientific. Science skeptical everything, including science itself. Lol, 30%, Taiwan, US. Oh thank extremely rich CEO untrustworthy pharmaceutical company!  pray away stay home pandemic ends “I believe short information bulletin private for-profit company responsibility side-effects”

We yet. 50 million people die year like every fucking year. People die get cowards . wasted two weeks reason whatsoever. exactly need keep number infected low possible vaccinate everyone. infected are, higher chance mutations could virulent, even worse, different enough protected existing vaccines, natural antibodies. people vaccinated it, harder current strain spread fewer vulnerability people nearby, places evolutionary pressure mutate. got drive test today felt danger all. testers fully masked shields well change gloves person. Feel free pm want know process! Can’t keep dream r/collapse going install socialist utopia aren’t afraid! weird think people actually want see relatives.

My aunt, cousin mother live 10 miles away me. seen aunt cousin 5 years, avoid mentally ill 'mother' like plague. masks virus issue even know isn’t going happen. General public probably going abandon masks early summer. It’s struggle getting people wear without complaining now. June perfectly accurate statement. trump go Oxford short. gotten excess multiple vaccines. Instead Americans stuck waiting countries succeed. lot people saying want take wondering why. examples may hurt company's image (a little bit) example less people get vaccinated. Tell important humanity? Right. moderna tested spread, heard Pfizer didn’t test it. think two situations comparable. One complete logistical clusterfuck borne cynical political machinations resulted massive death toll unconscionable profits biggest companies, complete logistical clusterfuck borne cynical political machinations resulted massive death toll unconscionable profits biggest companies. you’re sick, yes. you’re sick, ~70% population vaccinated, you’re sick, no. one going realistically wear mask every time go public go bar go gathering. hard now? really, especially many things would normally aren’t feasible. things concerts parties weddings happening pre-Covid safety level... good luck getting anyone wear mask. People already attend weddings parties *during worst part pandemic* maskless.... you’re mind think people wear mask it’s considered “over”. Lol. posted get rise guys. god it’s easy. god it’s easy guys go straight ‘info wars’ insult. No...I don’t watch info wars. questioning Big Pharma makes conspiracy theorist...I guess one. Jesus...when left become pawns Pharmaceutical creeps? Seriously...does someone want answer that? Let guess...you guys Monsanto supporters, too? C’mon...you guys make easy power hungry rich creeps. Oh...but “science”...give break. exception ""transitory travel"" explicitly exempts people stopping highway rest stop airport layover. sure states. Gonna worst April fools joke history sad read. NYC early spring. one believed us described it. Makes sad hear nine months later rest country.    Can’t get test get together? Jeff Bezos entitled? equally involved creating vaccine.  SIL receiving one next week. good vaccine doesn’t need stored super low temperatures like Pfizer vaccine means one could reach broader public developed countries lot easier wonder would be.. I'm ex smoker 7 months. good news! That’s fine. contagious it’s limited upper airways? Won’t breathing, coughs occasional sneezing carry less it? 

I honestly don’t know. often need vaccines? test consistency dosage. data tainted unsure caused what. partnering Russian vaccine starting phase 3. limitation nature constitutional republic. want differently next time, ask representative introduce constitutional amendment would cover situation like this. Tl;dr: general people doubling beliefs.

Sort responder said: deaths going up, hospital ICU slammed, general public still advocating ""open county"", ""recall Newsome"" (CA governor), even sheriffs office made statement enforcing CA curfew, shelter place orders, mandates e.g. restaurants seating outside only. Anyone talking reporting violations referred Narc and/or compared people ratting Jewish folk Holocaust Germany. that's community. seems vary individual level, see people Facebook community pages advocating masks safety, time photography business advertising 'maskless Santa photos' *lot* commenters thrilled ""the kids NEED memories"". Part job going people's homes (recently WFH due late stage pregnancy) final straw family denied covid symptoms pre-visit, home told use sanitizer ""a bug"", days later admitted covid+ exposing several us - wear surgical masks goggles routinely informed us would worn N95 registered nurse would gone out. frustrating disheartening so... helpless watch people die complications hear ignorant person whine ""99.9% survival rate"" ""my freedom"" coworkers exposed death every goddamn day due irresponsibility.

Based video I’ve seen parents’ social media (anti-maskers), would guess annoyed first request mask daughter made sure film gentle attempt get mask (for “proof”), thinking would strictly enforced. Notice father gets way serious forceful covering they’re finally asked leave. agree. I'm sure felt need tell that, fact correct. I’m you, bud. not. really nice masks super comfortable place called Tom Bihn TrUsT rUsHed VaCcInE vIrTuE sIgNaL think entitled since part team made vaccine. Currently due March. Hoping get go labor husband support maybe even wear mask.  vaccine give AIDS, created antibodies AIDS (which tests look for). wrong stopped work vaccine. Yes Phase 1 vaccinations intended filled Pfizer Moderna vaccines. Science scripture, changes new data. Stop BS. looking comment. expecting much guy suit delivered. It’s decision. Well yes, wanted it, could gotten it. owns company made it. That’s implied. comment revealed nothing already said. story said didn’t want yet, people need more. that’s true. 1700 US healthcare workers died COVID end September. things gotten lot worse since then.

Even 60 years old, 1% chance fatality COVID, that’s also people symptomatic enough want get test. So, it’s likely odds even better. younger 60. 80 years old, 15% chance fatality. means needs vaccine 15 times less 80 year old needs vaccine, regardless factors job status.

If told right could get vaccine, would guaranteed work; let’s say it’s magic vaccine also guaranteed 0 side effects don’t get conspiracies, would take vaccine, knowing unlikely die COVID, currently taking away another person’s opportunity get vaccinated right now, someone much higher chance lasting health conditions death COVID? reading thread shows little empathy people anymore, like fuck.

The vaccine limited resource right now. Taking one means someone else doesn’t, unlike commodities deal day-to-day. buy loaf bread, prevent anyone else also getting loaf bread, supply bigger demand.

People talking about, “Oh, it’s one person won’t get vaccine now.” yeah, that’s right, person lot likely die COVID CEO is, he’s making smart move.

The CEO also rich fuck. doesn’t need go outside contact anyone. hire people “outside” stuff him. doesn’t really need vaccine right reason age.

And yes, could also trying look like even better dude, hoping get charity support something. conspiracy theorists could right, COVID hoax, we’re purgatory, last year hell appetizer vaccines take minds turn us homosexual communists. don’t know man. say perfectly logical reasons events unfolding. Sure, it’s healthy skeptical, could multiple advantages forgoing vaccine right now, learn recognize you’re barking wrong tree.

Also, still idea trying say comment, again, doesn’t add anything, doesn’t make sense, incomplete thought. take show confidence it, “cut line” confident fuck something know absolutely nothing except tell you. GL.  priority right get people need want it, let late adopters hold choose. healthcare workers even frontline roles vaccinated ""within week"" Fauci gets his? Seems need more. sure Biden's care average person. clip proposing cut medicare social security. good guy competent leader, ""not trump"" qualification lead country, ""the lesser two evils"" bunch crap keep average voter Yes us dying mythical ""hard lockdown"" literally two options. fly see them? take trip see them?

What stated completely point. whole time simp. ignorance subject truly sad behold. 800 children young adults developed Narcolepsy (a permanent nerve disease) rushed Pandemrix vaccine Sweden 11 years ago. 

This nothing conspiracy theories. mRNA vaccine (which vaccine is) unprecedented USA young adults must ask risk rushed, unprecedented vaccine bigger risk Covid-19 presents. rational, intelligent young person *should* ask question, knowing survival rate Covid healthy young adults infinitely approaching 100%. Yea well Trump fucked again. Yeah, numbers come I'm anything differently...but least people got vaccinated milder cases. Well, video filmed parts cut / edited out, I'd wager yes, probably least saying pretty stupid shit debating point ways reflect positively them, cut parts out.

People getting mad said politicians downplayed disease year long. Hear, hear! IDK, us 95% immune another months reason keep this. honestly care whether takes it. FDA, Canada, UK Bahrain approved vaccine. Dr Fauci arguably one famous doctors pandemic said take it. would be? type message trying relay here? think happen you?

It’s impractical homes. Cue George Michael video... well, add drink, maybe candy two :) Sadly, probably right. Everyone harping wearing masks social distancing give damn get shot. ""I'm safe now, screw you"".

I'm really sad large number Americans reacted general. Putting economy health (although still think proper lockdown government compensation would fraction negative impact economy became), politicizing mask wearing, complete narcissistic behavior, disregard wellbeing others. parents. parents stupid ones here, kids mercy.  crying shame USA got wrong schools. Experts including Fauci knew agreed far back May virus poses incredibly little relative threat children young people.

We able devise strategy incorporates safety measures like masks./spreading desks, staggering periods, etc. Younger teachers also relatively low risk serious complications could declared essential kept work. Older/Compromised teachers could given pay.

Thank goodness. varying levels comfort groups amongst friends/family driving god damn wall try want. top comment ""Would scary find someone position not"". nurse saying many subreddit also saying without realizing Everyone else taking someone’s word level.

Agreed. lay people need spend time scientifically examining chain authority rather screaming ""trust science"". example, mega corporations trustworthy? track record twisting truth massive profits made?

let us consider case purdue pharma, couple months back pleaded guilty several charges including ""conspiracy defraud United States violating federal anti-kickback laws"". health care company prioritized profits health people quite ok cause mass opioid addiction exchange profits. instance pharma industry generally mega corporations twisted truth make profits expense public. hell, decades back, scientists white lab coats corporations trying convincing us smoking quite fine track record health insurance system US revolving doors regulation agencies like FDA, FCC, EPA inspire confidence interests public's interests aligned.

given this, ""trust science"" innocent shorthand suggesting. asking forget systemic corruption deep vested interests general nature mega corporations revolving doors institutions agencies. excuse little rationally skeptical enough evidence convince pharma industry least currently usual mega-greedy self.

for example, let ask - many us quite ok tanking whole economy livelihood billions people year response pandemic. billions people made major sacrifices (no talking getting haircut). pfizers modernas willing let go billions dollars make vaccine free? talking govt making free. talking pfizers modernas making vaccine free govts people. not, forget science reject vaccines ethical grounds. moral balls same? “You think didn’t know that?” testing subjects throughout study noticed drop asymptomatic prevalence. ""No"" - final answer way off. Even perfect vaccine back normal early 2022 earliest. Billions people need get it. last time vaccine rushed caused narcolepsi children. think that’s false equivalency. matter distasteful find current US administration, legitimately elected 2016 (not 2020 obviously) American rules elections. US remains democracy, subject far scrutiny many entities, including NY Times, Chinese government. CCP basically carte blanche whatever want say whatever want China. 

So despite everything trust US (and democracies) way trust Chinese dictatorship. Essentially, US incompetent, don’t think US institutions straight lying COVID. remember first wave hospitals overwhelmed nurse getting fired complaining PPE wear work. I’ve thought particular verse lot well! course faith God timing. But, I’m going wear seat belt get car. Ya know? makes sense. 

Their justification lazy answer it. much communication abilities reason don’t understand rectify issue. Democrats fighting direct relief people, relief small businesses, funding states able keep people home. 

Republicans fighting corporations protected liabilities related covid, stripping people rights pursue damages injuries illnesses. 

Both sides /s Christ gone almost testing stage 3 vaccines go through, thoroughly tested 44,000 patients, likely struck lightning severe reaction it.

&amp;#x200B;

What's worst happens? people, they'll feel shitty days immune system adjusts. really think there's much worry about. whole fucking point science trust it; go perform experiment see yourself.

Anyone looking trust science lazy Q1: soon think vaccine production scaled &amp; distributed across world? Especially third world countries. kind challenges countries encounter procurement it?

Q2: becomes future work? go back-- past forever lost? 

Q3: Would love recommendations pandemic/vaccine science readings (aside book, ofcourse currently reading!)  “Mild” cases covid often come long term neurological problems. 

People getting POT syndrome, memory loss, tiredness, hair loss. 

I don’t want that. new influenza, happens highly transmissible fairly virulent. Another coronavirus. new virus another sort coming group known single-stranded RNA viruses, high rates mutation, recombination reassortment, therefore high capacity adapt new hosts. mean rbis vaccine better pzifer vaccine??? suspicious rankings well assumed Bloomberg using government data face value. article Bloomberg link methodology, discuss reliability data Governments analyzed it.

It won’t perfect least acknowledged official stats necessarily trustworthy tried work around it. risk assessment situation tells id rather take chances covid time passed Like we’re last ones horror movie.

My friend recover fairly quickly it’s worth. finish movie? idiots every country bub talking doctors nurses, don’t think fair. 

Doctors nurses:

A) very, used hearing song dance pharma companies awesome new treatments end working better came 

B) used clinical trials taking 3-5 years

C) watched news everyone else administration putting pressure regulators rush vaccine.

These reasonable concerns, assuaged actually looking data FDAs report, something may probably haven’t time do. 

And also may realize differences here:

A) pharma studies new treatments very-well-studied diseases already treatment , company can’t make much money old treatment anymore. That’s much challenging task every pharma company world taking first crack brand new disease existing product for. (But actually similar diseases working 15 years)

B) clinical trials take year recruit enough volunteers, several years waiting rare diseases happen. It’s different much faster situation huge pandemic lots infections lots volunteers.

C) first vaccine gate company refused operation warp speed money trial done, study data public, president rush election, etc etc.

Bottom line busy doctor comparing trial ones familiar with, skepticism understandable, good reasons things went fast. single information side effects? happened Japan? need beta-testers

This clinical trial for... best reason believe Florida good shape currently 80F there. trapped indoors themselves, clobbered recirculated air. ""STOCKHOLM (AP) — Health officials Sweden, opted respond first wave COVID-19 national lockdown, misjudged power virus’s resurgence, country’s prime minister said Tuesday, independent commission criticized country’s strategy.

Oh absolutely taken approach (I used work medical field mentality exposure pathogen stuck me). saying confirmed cases close startling. 
Stay safe. Kobe? eternal year. kids go back school vaccine(s) general availability. sure teachers get sick kids get sick carriers back homes. see kids going back person school viable year unless idiots stop idiots get shots. think allocate proposed relief money vaccine rollout

Why? vaccine rollout's success country hinging funds released? thought funds already secured? browse conspiracy subreddit so... New york able close borders ground incoming flights europe? new york one saying flu? federal guidance states handle patients? new york listened president back march would 10x deaths.

Did new york screw testing adequate testing march? I’m looking forward getting parent 2 year old new baby May, angry see anti-Vaxers still cause lot problems children probably won’t able get while, especially newborn. majority/near majority cases asymptomatic. saying Pfizer trials tested symptomatic?  Obviously primary concern getting everyone vaccinated once, possible even useful vaccinated vaccines? lot people getting infected, less vaccines needed well cause herd immunity compared before. guess that's good lol got really lucky early one oldest survivors. hospital 80s lived.

We're asking much. 90-95% storage -80C gradual warming 18-23C prior injection. 

They studies see could storage -20C (or better yet, 4-8C) instead. evidence-supported account, far know, far, fateful spillover event occurred, where, when. badly need answers questions.

Human behavior that’s extraordinarily risky? Close contact, without knowledgeable protections you, wild animals. Population growth combined high per-capita consumption. likely far less since lower chance reproducing? Viruses microorganisms thus cannot reproduce outside targeted cells. give information actually want: Expected timelines unapproved vaccines effective rate approved vaccines. means 2 million dead need 70% population disease. first big scientific papers mRNA vaccines published 90's first trials made animals. 

A simple Google search tell currently 6 coronaviruses known affect humans, common cold one them, along SARS MERS.

The news gonna cover everything need know. cute believe nonsense. Agreed - know people going ignore mandate, anything point would better nothing, annoys hell pretends curfew anything. also need federal support cover things economically, coming anytime soon least.

Thanks answers (and sorry English, wich native language) tf number keep going up, heard 75% 80%, 85%... Basically, mental process eating entire chocolate cake 🤤😭  city stayed car, everyone masks, talked several feet away. would love people kept wearing masks least public transit, sick not. shopping/stores makes sense.

Usually see inverse people like Australians refusing acknowledge luck lol. minimizing concerns black community? Literally every argument taking vaccine given Tuskagee Experiment. get free cheesesteak covid vaccine? Nice time pointing “it’s going away own!” 

They won’t admit pandemic widespread problem, won’t wear masks, politicize people wear won’t get vaccine stop it?

They selfish, petty small minded. hate say we’re better without them. Let play games die it. Darwinism finest. Nope, news broke today. get results 20 I'm sure. people clinic thought so, I've heard might call everyone back get shots. got vaccine trial, get placebo time, vice versa. However, cost lot money time I'm inclined believe notify people one got trial let placebos come get real deal. Pfizer going stuff right leaning towards latter, expect Moderna same. *Knox County. city mayor. Fine, I'll go ""first"". Shoot up. TL;DR jack shit new President United States vaccine. two things alone least ease tension. lot things come light past 9 months right leadership, maybe learn things start process making changes.

There two paths forward:

\- GOP continues promote Trumpism, deny facts science, deny individual human rights, deny climate change, obstruct, country descend much chaos inequality.

\- Biden leaders legislate policies promote climate health, individual health, income equality, international partnerships human rights mature thoughtful communication, think, despite loud-mouths extremes, see positive growth across board.

Obviously, something comes nowhere, unprepared unwilling deal consequences, like Covid-19 pandemic, going take steps backwards. Millions people California commute 50 miles years years order able afford house outside urban areas. think you’re bit harsh guy 71% say definitely get it, 39% say wait see goes. So, moment, conclude 61% willing take *now*? understand wearing mask sick. average person, wont wearing masks.  New normal crew-member. Proud you. Don’t give up! can’t get one another year. Got 39 states ahead deaths per capita. Long list governors go newsom Same. I've learned ton new cooking skills year, lost weight process, I'm ready someone else cook nice, fat, heart attack inducing steak. 

I'm happy there's light end tunnel train. Nah covids over. Well back fuck employees. Get work 102 fever. much better, takes 20 minutes get results. 

People buy tests homies weekend away together. Yes, specificity/sensitivity high PCR tests, **game-changer**. hope going long term take away. CDC needs PR revamp revitalize educating population high risk category and/or interact immuno compromised people yes. link it.

The things I’ve seen people saying may FEEL safe resume normal life may continue shaking hands etc. haven’t seen anyone, official even Reddit, call restrictions immunity.

There epidemic malcontents want stay inside forever. one wants go forever. Yeah don’t think buddy, LOT people NOW. You’re welcome wear mask forever though I'm also medicine agree. going become part ""uniform"" working hospital like scrubs. Bullshit Unusually, fever inflammation lungs persisted longer 30 days

Well sounds particularly horrific. ""The fact patient unable fight disease without treatment suggests antibodies contribute control SARS-CoV-2,"" explained Dr Matthew Buckland Department Clinical Immunology, Barts Health, London. ""But lack antibodies may also prevented COVID-19 becoming life-threatening, antibodies trigger damaging immune response.

So recommendation based experience single patient ""XLA, rare genetic condition affects body's ability produce antibodies hence fight ""All suggests treatments need tailored individual patients, depending underlying condition - example, whether virus causing symptoms, immune response.

That's probably biggest takeaway. Maybe helpful maybe not, depends situation. study indicates could helpful patients XLA. Yes it’s obviously Italy Argentina didnt. Sars blip. came went away 2 months. 

Some asians wore masks toxic pollution. mean going information currently available. stands 2 vaccines know available approved April.

More vaccines get approved equals faster timeline. high efficacy Moderna vaccine noted two doses given 28 days apart. level effectiveness Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 

Pretty sure need two doses gonna happen.

1. There’s never going cases. thing always going us, like flu.

2. People won’t shop stores requring masks Maybe sick, dont see people wearing masks past summer. know several restaurants dont mask mandates even though PA mask mandate. two shot. probably won’t choice vaccine receive. He's thinking kinda right way, makes huge logical leaps wrong direction moment stop. I'll explain:

*If* one cells add mRNA genome...

 what.

Now, that's staggeringly huge ""if"" first place. likelihood happening incredibly tiny. let's say happens one cells.

That cell, cell, starts making spike proteins like crazy ends bunch spikes surface. Well cell look like immune system? virus. gets eaten T-cell. Game over.

Guess happens get vaccine. 


The damn thing, without step mRNA added DNA. odds us able get 65% population voluntarily get vaccine somewhere slim none ... never mind 85%. sub huge influence entire world something? 

Listen wearing mask(which hard all) flu season means millions people catching it, truly see bad thing? German here:

We got lucky, handle better. Wearing mask want spread disease, want hurt people, bad kids exactly? great lesson kids: mildly inconveniencing literally save lives! idea bad handling looks like ... least huge preparation campaign vaccinations. Meanwhile Czech Republic Poland, governments exactly nothing hoping sort later ... think still mail-in test lab remember right? still isn’t approved test gives immediate readout like pregnancy test. vaccine widely available vaccine? Basically us dealing whole time. states close, others don’t, it’s not. ...This highly, highly unusual crash. We've used platform clinical trials years already. difference CoV2 spike made instead another viral protein.

I'm seeing massive potential long term effects, especially given entire shot completely degraded within weeks days/hours.

Where's mechanism long term impact? don’t know able mingle indoors unmasked without potentially making others sick, even vaccine. Relying immunity one thing. Acknowledging immunity factor spread another. Ah okay see thank you! skews towards 92% two dose cohort pulls efficacy. to? hope you’re right. That's good comparation. know it’s best comply, SON FUCK! older mothers, every year wait baby increases health risks lot. 

Young women though, idea. would take 62% Vaccine one offered me, yes. would still 62% chance protection currently. (edited make bit sense) 

Regarding factory point - It’s totally different vaccine, know factory creates AstraZeneca effectively produce Pfizer? don’t use identical materials start. 

Also would stop investing safe effective vaccine cheaper produce en masse it’s easier handle logistically one produced higher efficacy? 

200 million AstraZeneca’s effective 20 million Pfizer’s. I'll get flu vaccine stay home I'm sick. I'd rather get flu wear mask winter. It’s hard say trust science receiving vaccine hasn’t given enough time go steps involved. Last checked (last week) Pfizer hadn’t released data peer review yet, one fundamental parts science ensure accuracy, safety efficacy. 

I’m antivaxer means, wish waited fully test long term effects findings peer reviewed. Maybe people actually first time around way Everything okay 'Science' says so. I'm currently one Phase 3 trials J&amp;J. They're looking two shot split dose right now. Timing wise first publicly vaccine approved. knows may gotten first privately?  Haha, contact tracing app PA atleast useless, months, alerted 100 people near someone, 100 people, none covid. Cases spiking everywhere - happens states aren’t allowed close borders. Early summer!?! SoCal (OC), people wearing them, (or ever). isnt individuals, organizations mandatory mask policies, makes sense. small fraction pop vaccinated, still required store whatever. vaccinated around lots people maybe Id wear one peace mind. lol part, vaccinated individual need wear mask, duh. dude, never said socialize bar mask on? said wear store public transit. relish basement life probably one care see cares see you. explanation dismissive attitude. definitely don’t young kids developing. kids could lose two years formative brain-development years. really dislike people like right now. I’m sure feeling mutual. 

When covid thing past,‘ im guessing you’ll empty feeling inside. maybe trust science stupid fucking PR stunt. would make fuck-all difference took not: really think people doubting legion scientists CEO taking it? No, CEO took placebo, CEO took better version, etc. - nothing going convince people already convinced vaccines safe. best case scenario, developed world.

Manufacturing could still put damper this. goals companies set ambitious date hit given number promised doses slip. Everyone keep getting hung fatality rate, that's that's important. NOT, let's discuss this.

There's necessarily tendency diseases become less fatal they've humans while. Evolution largely random mutations get selected for/against, mutations get selected nothing. comes diseases, host survive die largely irrelevant, disease spread victim becomes incapacitated. Latent periods symptomless contagion usually selected for, spreading, fate host matter much. 

Smallpox emerged 3000 years ago, still fatality rate 40% eradicated 1980. 

The black death us least since 14th century, hasa fatality rate 50%-60%. 

Malaria humans least 2500 years, still accounts 20% childhood fatalities worldwide.

There 30 infectious diseases various prevalence contagious spread quite easily. basically universally fatal, yet still exist still get them, survive hosts regardless happens humans get (rabies comes mind). pretty common we'll likely never get rid them, we're lucky fatal others list (influenza example). 

Just good chance surviving diseases mean ignore allow contract it. diseases capable long term harm health, even survive initial illness. Cringe I’m going sound dumb one vaccine better other?

I’m track get Pfizer vaccine soon. going saying should’ve gotten Moderna one? point something face damaging. okay, go science denial guess. government employee government insurance paid taxes? Depends people it. loud majority doesnt want wear anymore, small minority feel societal pressure stop wearing them, regardless like not. 

People stop wearing needed anymore suck remind us damn pandemic J&amp;J better track record.

I speak toward vaccine r&amp;d, maybe best track records overall: don’t get either, see maskless kids neighborhood. kid one wearing mask time go outside. Unlike idiot anti-maskers, doesn’t complain it.

If get kid wear pants, get wear mask. remember kid 2, went nudist phase. still wear clothes went outside. Except , examine evidence. Probably can't understand evidence. needs trust scientist agree lot thats good perspective. mainly commenting direct need convince anti people, theres lot play here. feel like trying disprove anti vax theory harm good. live world like pharma associate scientists day, opinions antivaxers easier brush off. depends perspective.  fucking presidents literally said they’ll take film. I’m tired dumb people man. could go USA take it... Spain/the EU approving mean illegal citizens get vaccine countries. like illegal spain eat beef, thinking allowed eat visiting USA. Soon: “He’S TaKInG VaCcINe! hE’s GoNnA MuRdER WHoLe WOrLD!!!1!!”

Maybe setting good example patient? going patient thing gets distributed important folks front elderly healthcare workers. That's inappropriately politicized poor leadership helm mattered most. Donald Trump head. Additionally, unpatriotic hack interested grifting way presidency. they’re two years old, isn’t big difference 9 months “entire life,” especially since don’t walk first year. 

Masks alter breathing, shoes alter walking. entire weight rests them. It’s valid comparison.  would too, likely I’ll get letter HR says “Get vaccinated date fired cause. Thanks!” Yup people love bring bad New York without mentioning many people population density. Autoimmunity, production errors, low efficacy leading people think they're immune behave way worsens pandemic... heartwarming see ceos finally showing empathy yet Aw shit. former Riversider can't say I'm surprised especially seeing announcement Sheriff put recently. lot former friends still headed Big Bear going beach every weekend. Makes feel crazy! FaScIsM duurr Ah yes, ethical businessman. Totally didn’t cement tons people getting vaccine move people think suspicious. full faith vaccines new type vaccine produced record time CEO wont take it??? Like what. I’m definitely waiting conventional vaccines since Im high risk would think hard lockdown would include checkpoints verifying paperwork show fact essential worker traveling reason. don’t think problem amount services considered essential people said. think fact didn’t matter essential not, could go anywhere wanted consequences.

If want true lockdown, set checkpoints, require paperwork, even limit access shopping essential services. (i.e. get one grocery trip per week)

But worked government years now, say there’s way would organized enough that. Near Nashville, TN.  Also went school Boston. Best place go school, confirm! :) Maybe participated vaccine trials? would highest road, imo. Here's naively hoping PR team carefully considered pros cons publicly stating calculated would improve optimism vaccine curtsied healthcare workers. Nobody burst bubble, pls. need this. Stands people exploited guinea pigs Science volunteering guinea pig Science. reminder NBC face checkers said Trump lying said would vaccine end don’t issue personally, implications isn’t great optics. selflessness CEO appreciated, might well take greater good trust instilled vaccine. source that? seems interesting. Jfc deal health crisis compromising health. go normal time probably go hard understand, yes? people do.

When deaths drop average Joe walk get vaccine, gone restrictions.

Social vs Scientific ending pandemic good points. 

One aspect consider happens supply chain catch it? whole Pfizer c-suite dies covid next week (yes, that's far-fetched), going noticable drop production distribution vaccines? doubt anyone knows answer, especially among random redditors, ""skipping line"" would mean worry finding out. ""A lot people saying worst thing Cosby scandal hypocrisy. Lots hypocrisy. agree. think worst thing raping.""

-Norm McDonald

Comedians Cars Getting Coffee vaccine different, point testing enough pregnant woman caused problem, meant them. flu kills many infants year want pregnant woman take it. Wouldn’t need 4 week lockdown? 2 weeks symptom onset, 2 virus run course? appreciate helping making point. Really? I’m getting vaccine doesn’t get first. doesn’t even trust vaccine. Call anti-covidvaxer don’t care. never claimed ethical... never part argument. difficulty reading comprehension definitely explains lot. also must point out, never referenced working Pfizer prove anything call utterly stupid comment questioning experience. pivot made argument made look like fool, got nothing else defend yourself. Truly pathetic display put - weak pivot like try use straw man. 

The irony arrogantly deriding great though. guess cliched internet moron day. Agree completely. breathing sometimes difficult never go unmasked outside home, whether indoors out. Ugh. both.  Agreed. think taking would really effect maybes either. think consider maybe care less takes not. BioNTech Yeah. would worried didn’t take it. ultimate accountability family get vaccine would rare vaccine reduce viral severity also decreasing odds transmitter. reality, vaccine likely also reduces ability spread well. Well great thing (for logistics purposes) 90+% covid19 deaths 15% population. vaccinating elderly persons (those 65), cuts 90% deaths. *The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment entered chat.* Lol. 

You think entitled specific job?

Do right government job? kidding. Back March 2nd, husband came awful fever. really confirmed cases area yet. days before, lunch doctors field New York. NYC, positive patients hospitals. husband get tested? No, bc test prove direct contact covid positive patient. use inhaler like tic tacs 6 weeks. kids got sick, though barely. coworkers got sick too, again, test bc lack tests way prove direct contact.

I know actually covid. But, made clear quickly thing got control.

He still tested once. literally high risk procedures covid patients. But, getting vaccine week next, yay guess? 

Our system broken. Na, victim complex Ehh like better honest. things better things better politics aside comes day day life prefer here. would much like legal weed tho. could fake results /s 

Seriously, people want believe. There's point. Completely. people! aren’t extensions mom dad. also think clearly bias kids - many posters probably love idea kids excluded travel future indefinite mask mandates planes. 

If covid brought control, be, need stop making children wear masks planes. Ungrateful. deal show people trust product. cares someone calls line cutter vaccine?

Virtue signaling like could, worst case hurt future vaccines thing mutates multiple Pfizer executives won’t take it. Best case “just” reinforce anti-bad paranoia push people avoid it. stat probably made work healthcare setting dealing directly covid coworkers hesitant refuse take vaccine. I'm going get week idgaf still Frequent testing good preventative measure. White House proved that. That's read too. awkward pointless line.  keep living like shut ins when..?

...until socially-maladjusted Redditors, whose parents paying lifestyles anyway, shut ins well pandemic hit remain shut ins say ok come out. workers knee deep shit months end. They’re surrounded death suffering. deal people deathbeds telling virus isn’t real, deal people deathbeds allowed see loved ones one last time. likely haven’t around lot family months.

Umm that’s moronic fault then... long term side effects really freaks out.

The race issue whole fucked ways put it. get sick stomach thinking ignorant is. mom works VA

the VA gov't organization. rules different. HIPPA still applies still careful say, lines acceptable behavior firing offenses clearly defined (unlike private industry fuzzy open interpretation). ""Staff at Food Drug Administration (FDA) approved emergency use Covd vaccination created by Moderna, meaning second wave inoculations likely begin soon.

This already happening, caused liability exclusion, exclusions nothing license kill. understand anything vaccine process? settled also ""who knows safe"". Ah yes, decades immunology medicinal expertise certainly end source information this, definitely random dickhead Reddit inflated sense self importance CERTAINLY doesn’t understand works begin with. Thanks input it’s worth much IMO can, might, cause civil unrest.

The government literally demolish house build highway - called eminent domain. compensated.

The government lock prison even execute - specific charges brought you, presented fair trial.

I understand things always work way real life, least say paper, time fact happen way.

What Cuomo threatening take away people's livelihoods, people already disproportionately struggling, without specific charges compensation all. large corporations remain open business deemed ""essential"".

No, can't blame ""the Fed"" giving relief package. Whether want not, one ordering closure, must foot bill.

This alarming everyone idea even allowed discussed. understand implication shortage ICU beds downplaying anything hoaxer/antimasker.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t know you’re talking about, stop talking embarrass please thinking time, think they're overly cautious. Many public health officials saying vaccine mid-late 2021 lol, obviously that's true. raised valid point. older brother got it, absolutely panicked, went CDC page someone age IFR like 0.03%. helped calm nerves. He's 44 btw. Clearly narrative statistics, statistics horrifying enough people horrified. due policies. hot summer florida everyone goes inside air conditioning. south go inside summer mild winter. north people go outside summer indoors cold winter. None policies seem affect spread, thing seems affect people congragate indoors. don’t understand it. Mississippi Christian. seems like best way follow Christ would protect neighbor.

I think disappointing thing 2020 ""mask controversy"" demonstrated precisely little respect people one another. wear pants public - like wearing pants, respect community want see running around underwear. mask different. 

We wash hands handling someone else's food. Wipe feet entering building home. reason opportunity make people feel comfortable prevent disease (not COVID) saves lives, much ask. 

I've never felt like country culture community forged weak bonds before. I’ll one ask hope clear confusion. 

When someone dies Covid underlying health condition, really know Covid killed say heart disease? (see below) I’m guessing really won’t know. 

On average, someone dies CVD every 37 seconds U.S. 2,353 deaths CVD day, based 2017 data. Could post links home? Would interesting read.  Yeah one! would invest funeral home? Start own? address points.

Unless mainstream news sources lying, Jens Spahn embrassing public saying saying reason, UK grossly negligent levels banana republic.

Or EMA using technicalities cover arse. think credible 15 anything common? happened 35 states? Source new strain? sorry him, read pfizer paper. 83% participants white, higher national average. actually quite typical experiments. actually concerned vaccine's effects people color. I’m kinda skeptical getting early choose I’m going Moderna *know* anything March. speculating. 18 months **optimistic** estimation. What's happening unprecedented. confident would take long bet it. odds would've netted nice gains cause definitely consensus outcome. double edit double post, hot you’re asking tens thousands people die potentially many, many risk long-term health effects disease could choose protect half year we’re unwilling use societal-level protection mechanisms?

I think I've mentioned single actionable policy proposal arguing think think, I've actually aren’t off-topic discussions

To subreddit? No. point Fauci making trying use models help prove? Absolutely. vaccines public health level effects months. That's fact. factually inaccurate say ""There effectively impact case death rates **several** months."" guess what? Even 10% fewer deaths effectively impact. That's big difference. Imagine could X get 10% fewer deaths. one say ""Eh, that's effectively impact.""

So, let's address things: Case counts climbing vaccine got approved. Even announcement back November things getting nuts. Point being: People getting lax regardless public thing you’re missing flu vaccines people choose use protect themselves.

They protect point. Flu vaccines pretty dismal efficacy rankings I'm actually going accept reason treat COVID differently influenza IFR total deaths drop influenza short-term economic analysis honestly pretty gross

You're one brough ""time lost"" listing deaths hospitalizations I've pretty clear scope regarding incredibly narrow. even mentioned weighing economic gains lives discussion comparing time lost negative economic factors.  Here's lines case missed talking productivity economy, there's LOT variables lost illness"" **less concern** one weighed restrictions get place disease lethal (both death rate deaths per day) flu.

The bolded part referring ""in comparison deaths overloading hospitals"" taken full seven months since pandemic began earnest US

Uhh... guess let 2000+ people dying per day April pandemic ""hadn't begun earnest.""

Metrics stated exaggerated. tell you, amount people still insist ""this nothing"" refuse wear mask, purely selfish need part social contract (ironically mostly bible thumpers), close 50%. 

Vaccines never prevent infection, thats expectation except ignorant, course, deaths vaccine ""normal level"" sucks, best be. Perfection enemy done, unfortunately big mantra medicine spite pretense otherwise. 

My point was, surveys may show 60% willing, details show longer road. Last one saw, 70% ""eventually willing"", like 40% immediately it. meaning road hitting level lowers r0 ""we winning now"" level still quite bit folks may think hope. years, multiple months. 

I actually feeling similar opinion, detail differences, crossing streams tone-lessness text. think really need look positivity here. 20% high means missing lots infections. Pfizer Pfizer vaccine

Thank :) keep hearing I'm interested they're it, went ahead tested keeping normal temps Pfizer ran ultralow.

Just due nature mRNA vaccine stability it... understand Pfizer's vaccine could technically similar shelf life outside ultralow temps bother even test see viable know ultralow guaranteed way slowing degradation. 

Something else slightly concerning, normal refrigeration temps easier achieve - fridge go out, temp increase would drastic closer room temp. could cause losses ultralow could allow time correction lose doses.

All attached hypothetical scenarios course work relevant areas we've talking past months. Adding this, concerts live entertainment lot harder physical distancing producers want sell many seats possible make profit. Even mask, thousands people packed venue (especially indoors) huge risk, people scream sing along concerts too. like said, even people tend go concerts less often, concerts happen time HUGE numbers people attendance.

People also tend travel concerts (I don’t go often closest large concert venues well hour me), increases risk bringing something back totally different community. absolutely sucks anyone works live entertainment (myself included here) concerts cannot back profitable way physical distancing non-issue.  college best year life definitely wrong LA full people identify with, MS full hicks trump voters. simple that.

Next question: get flu shot year? not. grinned tone changed. mind, right. hope Americans take attitude soon. Either gamble covid gamble shots. status quo can't continue. Efficacy =/= Effectiveness. 90+% vaccines far require super cold storage whereas Oxford’s vaccine not. There’s also cost consider, Oxford’s vaccine costs tenth Pfizer vaccine. 

It’s exam. 70% perfectly good enough ensuring herd immunity. flu vaccine use every year ~30% accuracy job protecting vulnerable ensuring hospitals don’t become overloaded. also lot vaccine already prepared, would incredibly wasteful it’s used. want kids get last visit grandma dies (cancer - doctors saying months.) completely different. 24 hours ago singing much different tune.

Just opinion.  CDC said ok it. Medicare would pay hospital keep covid positive patient stable hospital. concern hospitals would fill sick people. send people somewhere. weeks feds realized problem changed rules hospitals could keep covid positive stable patients get reimbursed. 

Here story Florida transferring people nursing homes Medicare said would pay hospital insults? slander subreddit loves throw around state problems?

Why California get free pass? mean ""if works"" ?

It's contagious disease. way stop spreading stopping people contact lots people.

If understand concepts viral contagious, kinda accept lockdowns work. Ask Bill Gates, probably read thoughts now. person much power cannot make sure gets wants, there.

Don't naive. Quarantine indeed good tool combat pandemic underused. followed countries like South Korea. 

When quarantine, lock person room 2 weeks allow leave. Food delivered wifi provided.

The vaccine already rushed. BioNTech vaccine actually invented 48h (based previous experience obviously) testing ramping production takes time.

We already many vaccine production facilities around world switched covid-19 vaccines build new facilities would take away personnel existing ones would experience slow downs. 

If time could educate new generation experts run new facilities time... tests. data, problem. right? mean plenty drugs pulled market black boxed due safety data came 10 years road. Hell pretty much reason drugs get pulled otherwise get approval. FDA started warp speed whatever called early 2000s get drugs approved faster, significant uptick number drugs got pulled due long term safety issues. literally one fastest drug approvals approval 5 months vs 5-10 years. mRNA vectors development 10+ years Moderna yet actually get approval now.

What think vaccine?

And, prevent happening again? lessons apply future? man made? we’ve finding variants like world months. It’s really nothing new wrong

I'm wrong currently exists data whatsoever COVID-19 vaccine affects persons younger 16.

Irrelevant. know kids vector. Well, us know. can't grasp it. research long term effects covid? Take pick. Thanks this.

Right UK reporting detected new strain. know, likely new strain would covered vaccine? news bullshit clearly shows little respect average people media has. 


What media says means nothing here. take say he's waiting line, take say did, get vaccine shot live tv different known safe vaccine. 


It's bullshit. one thing guarantee scared Covid would take vaccine. would bet parents, still alive, waiting line vaccine. wanna start saying anti-vax. I’ve vaccinated shit, Call crazy, I’m definitely getting covid vaccine right away. I’m suspicious side effects. California record. Texas reported 58,256 new cases December 11th. article didnt argue opposite, said acknowledged issue tried adjust it. Fuck me, see person accused did.

And clarify, calling doctors delusional? Where'd get degree? many patients see regularly? Yeah, exactly. Stay lane. point people questioning ""science"" scientific innovations inventions, especially day age, bureaucracy, lobbies politics run science. 

Claiming ""I trust science"" blindly -in ways- anti-science. one question science everything mentioned above? we're going trust science blindly what's difference science religion? mean, impossible put context headline.

The article context relying on.  people self destructive satisfied lose all.  say that? seriously comparing 2017-2018 flu season happening now, pretending ignorant attempt sway lower-intelligence readers political viewpoint pushing?

Which it, stupid, evil, malignant operative pretending stupid? stupid even know?

The [CDC compiles statistics flu burden even worst flu season unlike anything seeing coronavirus.

Anyone half brain see flu normally results 600,000 hospitalizations, anywhere 20,000 50,000 deaths. 

So yes, 2017-2018 season, hospitalizations spiked 810,000, pretty serious, right? Except 61,000 deaths flu season. Higher most, still low, especially realizing overtaxed hospitals were. 

Coronavirus: 300,000 deaths climbing. 
2017-2018 flu: 61,000 deaths

Thanks link. That's look countries. Like would worried FDA saying yes, fact Health Canada British equivalent said yes counter saying. remember google later! Fair ask behavior long take?

Higher case counts take longer pull herd immunity. long high case counts persist, able open back up.

Now, high case counts relative. Right now, hospital systems struggling 200k daily cases. get good chunk high risk folks vaccinated, might able handle 300k 500k Cases:Hospitilization rate drop.

So, play cool help case counts drop herd immunity comes play herd immunity really plummet also keep things rising fast open back up.

Because vaccine continues roll further, socialization threshhold exponential growth gets higher higher.  lower case count gives us buffer get 1 R0 react. three four weeks R0 1 bites us relatively low case counts, two three months. high case counts, single replication cycle put us shit.

I kind rambled, think answered question.

The thing is, fuck already vaccinated, still inside window vulnerability. that's really wasted resources. extra careful first week two save ""big"" parties month out. Yes was. blindly trust anyone anything. Use critical thinking skills research things make decisions yourself. blindly listen others regardless qualifications referring something popping years effect vaccine that's unlikely. read mRNA vaccines work them, see way could dangerous normal person. Medical workers deserve breaks physical mental health. Otherwise burn out, get sick, won’t able job. cant put fire also fire. can’t believe would say that. question only, know all.

Funny given much keep telling doctors wrong another comment thread cursing it.

You correct time, anyone contact covid risk. doesn’t prove thanksgiving cause rise cases. Cases always going even thanksgiving many warnings it. thanksgiving happened trend remained same. major increase it. may true can't make vaccine kids I'm wrong.
 
This wrong (at least presently facts go on).
 
You're wrong currently exists **no data** whatsoever COVID-19 vaccine affects persons younger 16.
 
When data exists, decision made whether vaccine mandated requirement attendance public education setting. Sure. even lock dining schools, still quite lot (potentially high-risk) people interacting one another, food processing plants, dialysis clinics, delivery stockrooms, on, many may live crowded conditions. even lockdown really stop people contact people. 

It also interesting think means lockdown ""work."" Sure, eradicate disease, worked. that, maybe create economic misery (and, hopefully, perhaps delay avert infections -- many counts success??) disease burns on. sense, lockdowns seem bit like moonshot. Yes, least two-year degree. possible may qualified decide best way go vaccine? 

Unfortunately I'm educated enough area raise concerns around ways things. support mass vaccination way, time.

You trusting scientists blind, religious faith. appreciate generally open questions. property taxes

California actually one lower effective property tax rates country.

Utilities, particularly electric rates, indeed fucked though. ASS, RIGHT PLEASE Probably wants wait least year see long term side effects. Smart man.  interpret curve. acceleration thanksgiving. It’s continuing previous upwards trend. IMO questioning something alone give form intellectual superiority. comes professionally produced vaccine middle global pandemic killed 1.6 million people, shut get line turn. duty world citizen demand it, whatever personal freedom think have. opinion may strong one, mine. 

Everyone fine consider risks opinions, refuse take vaccine time judge society ostacising since refused something benefit greater group instead acted selfishly. 

If willing vaccinate take risk, right respect owed anything society choosing reject. Tough cookies feel slighted offended attitude honest, think need hear it.

This nonsense shame either believing knowingly spreading falsehoods. wonder trust doctors go you? explain risks vaccines general vs risks Covid demographic.

Remember, getting vaccine vs getting vaccine, risks getting vaccine vs getting Covid.

People warning would huge spike Halloween barely increase cases afterwards. thanksgiving happened large increase cases result Thanksgiving. forget, activation immune system give GBS. getting sick also possibility. one suggesting children carry vaccine.
 
You're arguing point made.
 
The argument cannot mandate vaccine condition public accommodation children vaccine literally test data pertaining persons age group. need beta-testers 👍 

I mean like yeah, we're lockdown, hey, got ECB printing quantitative easing us ..so cool ;-) (aside small businesses oddball)

Also, tell anyone ...most countries Europe never really got hit hard, playing wait-n-see

Don't believe us ...check excess mortality bottom (we track guys, test stuff us 🙌 real reason europe taking long authorise ? probably negotiate corrupt country score deal think referencing different statistics, comment replying referencing IFR referencing CFR. Scientists absolutely certain saturated fats bad people. problem one could confirm scientifically. Since popular belief, scientist confirm simply ignored lack confirmation, decades. illustrates science may great, scientists still human. right. relevant Coronavirus. I'm removing it. Dude. Re-read writing. sounds sarcastic af. title like know upvoted post reddit history! It’s already closer 400k given excess deaths counting.  FDA approve vaccination kids benefits people intelligent question scientist would thought of! call lab let know. 

Logistics management part job.

If ever involved product deployment industry know people fuck production likely not.

On top that, vaccines always going handled professionals; first batches surely handled top-notch scientists, mass deployment, level caution inevitably drop. happens that? first vaccine kind, takes time industry trial error &amp; develop standards mass distribution.

I'm sure prick people questioning mRNA vaccine. could've adopted mature type vaccines *fucking global pandemic*, higher-ups decided best time bypass heavy regulation push experimental tech approved. safe effective save millions lives. bring good point. Sorry you’ll downvoted oblivion. Let echo-chamber. like way. Researchers find COVID-infected children major carriers, complicating school-reopening debate

This posted sub days ago. seems obvious--why children carry disease like every human. Gen-Zoomers... Damn... That's gonna thing... here. call even free since signed local organization usually visits Santa alternative year. lump coal would better gift. could provide warmth. 

Now kids might put diabetic obese parents hospital $1500 ambulance ride. Yeah get show US health care workers. want get hospitalizations deaths first. keep hearing ""it work several months"" still understand why. mentions traveling holidays problem, okay that's legitimate, jumps right ""it several months"".

So wanna know... *our behavior* long take? something control? quickly vaccine rolled out... obviously control?

""The recommendations insensitive""... Ay Tony, instead telling us feel, bout tell us KNOW.  brings interesting concept.

What's effect early adopter global carbon emissions?

Imagine kids, raised well would using solar panels, avoiding plastic consumption maximum, avoiding meat, etc.

What's going mean world additional two people investing emerging green technologies. could enough offset consumption. Even moreso go green technology. guy developing new green technologies big impact global emissions. Idiots ""have faith science"" completely miss point science. Lame muppet. article posted actually argued opposite yours. Fuck me, either delusional idiot. Everyone dying everywhere lack equipment. paid.... ANY... attention news?!

Weird trouble providing sources something that's news.

The claim thousands people died Colorado Trump stole ventilators would kept alive. 

I know lots people died. died Colorado enough ventilators go around? 

It seems like type thing we'd read endlessly run-up election day. weird thing media missed.

Since find articles it, asked sources. failed provide single source, despite claiming anyone paying attention news seen them.

Here's [an article directly contradicts Care argue sources? Got better ones? want keep spouting bullshit without backing up?

[Another fun one says waiting yours. nurse, explain lay people mRNA vaccines prior Covid vaccine despite researchers working decades people take Covid vaccine 8 month research/testing period despite desease high survivability numbers. two weeks since comment. exactly think going happen, hm? Another successful NFL week books. W I'm even CA.

Calm down, turn internet take deep breath. vaccine first kind developed short timeline. think particularly farfetched minorities express concern given historical context. like stab-proof vests take shows try stab them. I’m rushing process bodies piling sky streets nobody cares return back normal horizon then. 

April-June fuck continue stupid shit “so pretend normal trying times”? fuck wrong people? good video showing Ron DeSantis leadership vaccination.  Literally none show that's socialism lmao

Sorry live reddit instead interact real world. fucking 19?

But holy shit, thought ""Socialism government stuff, stuff socialist is"" meme mocking dumb righties. genuinely parroting it.  Horseshoe theory action lol Kids. Carriers. 

Vectors. need face reality realise state fucking up, worse Florida, without slander comes it.

Look frontpage 'subreddit', go Mississippi thread compare California LA thread. good, indicating rising hospitalizations, ICU usage people ventilators. Welfare usage significantly higher blacks accounting almost 40% recipients. Often, healthcare part welfare package. States giving free socialized healthcare blacks already things already ""dicey"" population.

Your answer popular inaccurate divisive. Looks like issues grievances he's nursing. might need walk. 15% Americans caught covid-19. people's employers pay medical bills? That's actually less anticipated. 

What I'm really worried Christmas. kinda feel nursing homes get vaccinated first since ease hospitilzations health care workers..I mean maybe not, argument made enough people vaccinated, sure. agree last. bit hesitant, though. almost got trouble 2 year old want buckle starting. two hour flight kid screamed head tried get kid calm (until descend when, course, would fall asleep). Really nothing worked. I'm glad older now.
(And get anyone - fly kids: way see extended family. Flights people ages.) applying EUA February since think reach case criteria early given spread. also much expansive criteria vaccines already approved - severe cases counted, two weeks vaccine given, 150+ cases needed. vaccine tested immunocompromised recommended persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may diminished immune response vaccine. data available concomitant use 
immunosuppressants. That's thought. mean, would suck look in-network ER critically injured car crash something.

The time got admitted hospital last year, went ER really really sick admitted. funny thing sign bunch paperwork getting admitted, high morphine did. joked probably co-signing someone's mortgage knew.  also hopefull we'll see noticible impact couple months. combine fear people think means safe again, really safe vacced population Absolutely!  AMEN!!! miss flirting without wondering person missing tooth.  Worst Christmas present ever. He’s going homes? town guy walks yard people flipping out. That’s much safer literally going house. Bruh anything see stupid Florida shit get brought know ur parrot conservative incapable self critical evaluation. Trump lost. give up. 

Also herd immunity doesn’t work. also saw economy would drop regardless Sweden’s economical forecasts last quarter. Smh real problem tested 39.5k people. That’s one lowest amounts we’ve seen long time. positivity rate going up. Yeah heard passing. Seems kinda weird getting shot flu. It’s scary nurse profusely stupid trusting big pharma. know Many doctors trust science.. never take experimental vaccine. type mrna vaccine never used want someone inject without really tested observed manufacturer ZERO liability. height clownery 2020. pfizer mod sub? don’t think we’ll wearing forever everywhere you? much longer? Things started dropping way summer. that's probably case Incredible isn’t never stop whole thing doomed. Yea, idk, seems like news networks like take words context. antibodies work? keep hearing antibodies go away months. makes sense me. But, example, I’m person left work everybody else got Covid. back July donate plasma weekly. 

But everybody else got it, exposed. Since didn’t get again, seems mean body produce antibodies kill off. fresh dose antibodies, mean they’ll likely last months? GBS vaccine side-effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I trust science"" religious statement. 

Can leave religion this, stick science (method inquiry) Science^(TM)  (cult belief) understand, comparing dudes mail room CEO. scrutiny spheres entirely different. Almost vaccine offer sterilizing immunity. behave like others. hear lot, understand concern, think warranted. lot things different vaccine enabled developed quickly safely. first related SARS (SARS-CoV), researched 15 years multiple vaccine trials, data gave huge boost work COVID (SARS-CoV-2). Second, everyone aligned urgency unlimited money. scientists studying SARS could easily pivot working COVID expertise, joined thousands researchers related expertise (e.g. studying viruses, study vaccines, etc) produced data six months virus normally see decade. COVID also aligned volunteers. take years recruit required number participants vaccine trial normally, follow 60 days. People usually interested. takes 3 years get last participant, can't take data FDA 3 years + 60 days. people lined COVID studies. FDA adminstrative bodies kept top schedules, less administrative waste time. combine unlimited money, zero wasted time, unlimited volunteers, make vaccine 9 months. likely get GBS flu flu vaccine though. could absolutely see masks staying airplanes, buses, hospitals, nursing homes forever. We've spent last 9 months convincing people they're remotely inconvenient hyping shit effectiveness. embraced idea wearing mask literally equivalent murder (despite 100+ flu seasons question deaths). hard go back that. know lots people insist masks barely inconvenience, absolutely are, can't wait stop wearing them.  Maybe get widespread distribution vaccine doubts already seeing serious long term effects covid survivors. make sense worry ""potential"" negative side effects vaccine (of indication trials done) already know serious negative side effects actual disease itself. people think whole thing joke really hard parent right now. 

Not saying right people unable unwilling continue deprive kids childhood. Again, saying right negligent believe reality. 

Being parent really sucks right now. Especially toddler. almost 3 year old basically missed entire year experiences could had. Zoos, trampoline parks, museums, free daycare gym, Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving. list endless. We've stayed home outdoor stuff distance. we've since basically April 1st weighed us caused lot issues mental health. (Both us parents, teenager, toddler.)

So... maybe smart thing do. people simply can't hold longer would guess. CDC still recommending immunocompromised individuals receive vaccine: individuals may still receive COVID-19 vaccination contraindications vaccination. However, counseled unknown vaccine safety profile effectiveness immunocompromised populations, well potential reduced immune responses need continue follow current guidance protect COVID-19


Source: Patience definitely seeing light end tunnel now. Hopefully don’t get ton complacency next 2-3 months. Yeah song every time. ""Oh no, different"" fundamentally different. comes misunderstanding science fear unknown. mechanism long term effect. bit mRNA given (similar look virus) immune system attacks remembers it. sees another RNA looks like (Covid) ready attack. ""She also exposed Bill Gates’ agenda India and Africa, along plans chip human race digital identification program ID2020."" part article linked, Bill Gates conspiracy reliable evidence. ICU LA area lost oxygen few, know possible.

Some treatments they're giving people vents plow oxygen. forget much one does, something crazy like 60lpm oxygen normally given patients 2 10 lpm range semi-long term treatment patients vents ever before. Point is, believe it. covid I've switch patients different oxygen outlets switching supplies, run supplies one supply needs reconnected new supply could temporarily o2 flowing.

Shit bad doubt many hospitals oxygen supply systems prepared this. Yeah, ""several months?""

Edit: words hard immediately start single dose trial, I'll agree there. trial two doses, right know single dose provide immunity lasts long double dose, especially elderly comorbidities may ""slowing down"" immune systems. approved yet. eventually  Why? mean there’s reason can’t go smell forest right now.. temperature requirements carrier mRNA, lipid Mano particles, ensure won’t degrade. Worst case would vaccine doesn’t anything it’s properly stored.

A *fucking global pandemic* actually best time use mRNA vaccine. They’ve development now, best opportunity use it.

Previously FDA requires new tech proven show higher efficacy existing vaccines. vaccines already really good, doesn’t make sense spend ton time money something might get approved it’s good existing tech.

Now pandemic, there’s existing vaccine. mRNA shines easy develop. took [two develop vaccine genome sequenced January. remaining 11 months ensure safety efficacy. can’t get two day turnarounds traditional vaccines. basically feel want whatever safety procedures are, whatever scientific guidelines are, etc; don’t really matter u/grandkaleidoscope feels vaccine released see 6-8 weeks death numbers drop fast since vulnerable inoculated. 80% move 100%. wrong thinking vaccines provide sterilizing immunity?

I think may case, yes. 2004 circumstances, inactivated vaccines elicit sufficiently high sustained antibody titers mucosal surfaces prevent local infection. infected mucosal surfaces pathogens encounter vaccine-induced IgG serum antibodies neutralize viruses, opsonize bacteria, activate complement cascade, limit multiplication spread, preventing tissue damage and, thus, clinical disease. vaccines fail induce sterilizing immunity obstacle successful disease control, although represents significant development specific vaccines chronic viral infection.

If I'm reading correctly, seems vaccines based inactivated viruses induce immune response kick virus infected started multiply--but long delay generally prevent whole body infected. Sweden tried failed, like many others stopped watching NFL ago concussion stuff. Felt like justify watching people themselves. miss it, though. really replaced anything. handling virus NFL comparison NBA also really surprise me. Im trusting government. I'm trusting peer reviewed scientific studies. here.

I'd wait 6 months vaccine available general public. least 12 month data available.. One things great thing everyone. best status quo worse, destructive. saw doors welding stuff, seemed pretty wild. Later, saw mention that, least cases, really trying limit number entrances apartment buildings, sealing certain doors. allow screening/monitoring leaving/entering.

I know that's true. put interesting perspective it, least. work, come single main entrance, reason. 38% isn’t driving anything. What’s 62% 4,000 5,000 even 3,000 deaths day seeing now. That’s still 1,800 deaths day nursing homes. nursing home myth needs die.....pun intended. Stop digging. Even make sure perpetually keep thrashing around? Although you’re tired swim then… But... model seem address concerns.

There appear change [any 4 seem slap fixed death rate called good. increase hospital resources get overwhelmed ""mandates easing"" model, decrease vulnerable get vaccinated ""rapid rollout"" model. approval criteria mentions benefits patients, benefits people around patients. legal standard ""identifying information."" Generally speaking, need show faces patients without permission. Thats exactly suggesting. public record, private one. raw version would far risky publish reviewed later date lawyer make sure personally identifiable information released would still extremely valuable public historical record. hope either dentist year. I’m sure feel great talking people truly hurting way mommy’s basement   trying argue right standard timeline creating testing vaccine? I’m specialist field I’m one judge. assume aren’t either.

Edit add also aren’t going intimidate talking making baseless attacks me. physicians like mine view risk administering vaccine great risk individual like myself

Pathetic, really place grasping straws here. Re: paying people’s bad choices.

In publicly funded model, part funding could come taxes unhealthy choices earmarked health care. essence, people would paying bad choices. Example: small tax alcohol, sweets, cigarettes etc. would go directly health care. drink while, don’t notice tax, drink lot, pre-paying health problems develop future. 

Some people smoke like chimneys die ripe old age, yet lung cancers develop people never smoked. latter penalized unlucky.

Of course, benefits system depend set up. devil details. Thats 2019 pretty bad year...but good God 2020 kick us rear. think single pressing issue regard future spillovers: meat consumption? Exotic animal trade? Global warming? Deforestation? ________?

What think instantly individuals stop future spillovers happening? Surely accounted quarantine ending making long term purchase. absolutely infantile argument. “The US bad China fine”.

No. pointing ridiculous are. nah, feel like reasonable argument. one chose ignore? current geopolitical situation gives way cold war specifically US China, sources know mouthpiece pro US propaganda easily again. 

Are Uighurs placed camps? mean yeah, going deny that. know happens camps seen couple reports turning bullshit I'm careful believe. 

But please, obvious beacon enlightenment, educate me. try take entire argument equation, lose shit edit :) cannot leave home go walk kids (all us masked) without seeing multiple people ages maskless congregating. walk large park/open space street, pass playground, it’s 50/50 mask/no-mask, numerous kids 4-13 main culprits. stop watch sometimes, without doubt kids maskless report parents/caregivers also maskless. kids always ask play, tell no. It’s frustrating sad. 

We saw wedding party day, well. maskless. wife’s critical care, APRN. disgust people palatable, mine. wish way could remember people may avoid future pandemic passed. proven selfish, stupid, dangerous - sure traits extend far beyond pandemic. would would safe future interactions beyond me.

I’d little hesitant maybe weigh risks/benefits me.  mean that's thing good idea Vaccine bypass regulations. I'm excited technical breakthroughs, I've read many good things mRNA treatment (prior Covid, often used experimental cancer treatment); what's happening moment effectively, significant portion population going jabbed traditionally unverified vaccine.

And solo opinion. check sub often, often see medical professionals voicing skepticism rushed development vaccine. support mass vaccination, wary specific type vaccine.

Yes, there's existing vaccine, development speed different vaccines necessarily vary. mentioned, yes ofc take much time reverse engineer mRNA sequence target protein; 11 additional months required make sure new vaccine dangerous (I believe spent lot time lipid nanoparticles too), personally, exactly see development time Covid mRNA vaccine 2 days.

Thousands people dying every day. me, would reasonable get vaccine safe well-tested person planet priority; really think time R&amp;D experimental vaccine.

If definitely *had* use mRNA whatever reason, could've produced subunit vaccines, tested past decades easier store &amp; transport anyway.

And low temperature mainly required preserve unstable mRNA, lipid nanoparticles. Lipid usually stable high temperatures, likely always stable mRNA. Yeah don’t think jumping line making show ‘look safe is’ important right now. dont even supply worry 33% wont take yet, CEO still get later isnt jumping ahead. positive thinking exist? aware mRNA vaccines clinical trials years vaccines cancer applications?

FDA run by..... government. don’t know you’re getting big hoss. doesn’t matter scientists come with. regulations they’re going set various governments. Go ahead get shot, I’m saying people weary.

There chance guy promoting fraud would admit going take it. would lie. do. said take it, trying vaccine vulnerable first. So, 1) official approval, people get Moderna? 2) many doses currently produced available US? cases vaccine news. 

The worst yet come. cover airholes, big one makes noise. Nice. prefer 'visceral'. IDK 'resuming normal life' means more. Human empathy displayed COVID displayed COVID, maybe.

Yeah, I've thought well. I'm sure certain things never completely go back 'normal'.

Unfortunately whole situation politicized mandates met severe resistance. Plus people can’t really afford lock stay home gov doesn’t seem inclined help make moment. 

I feel like we’re cornered. Yes, ok, thank you. I've thinking stuff now, never really pulled pieces together like did. yes, noticed things pointed well, 100% explain see stuff nurses flies face science.

Like you, way saying nurses important. They're extremely important, job vital types healthcare. They're scientists, though, lumped together. mean should. think vaccinated people can't spread, sure. wear masks well everyone vaccinated. Well want least. antivaccers, well own.  think basically 1B. healthcare providers nursing home residents Oh see mean now. Serious question. everyone excited take vaccine know nothing pushed quickly? didn’t mention effective New strain Covid they’re finding UK.. waiting this, concur. need watch again! hilarious thing is, 2020 started, ""welcome year hindsight"".

Anyway, innnnnnn hindsight..... I'm already committed continue wearing mask public work. cold flu year whereas normally get one year. 


Plus resting asshole face people telling stupid shit like ""cheer bad"" ""smile dude, nice day there"". Nice bailey. Pity motte. God, let already!
Waiting see huge line vaccines conspirators waiting find can’t go abroad without it. dodged question. intended purpose questioning vaccine constantly? outcome hope achieve? rare black white scenario - either someone takes vaccine don't. pushes people ""don't"" category, even though logical reason so. Covid - ""years"" test vaccine see long term effects. I've said multiple times now, covid already long term effects. make sense worried possibility vaccine long term ill effects disease vaccinating already shown long term effects. mental health children important health something something freedom.  This.

I liked 2019. nearly kicked tRump office made first Reddit account.  also agree, think spring sounds realistic. augmentative twat. Yeah, government give billions wall street Cali? think thing happen flu? get you’re saying case coronavirus equally less harmful kids seasonal flu, think parents charged negligently exposing kids corona thing every flu season? Great info, thank much! don’t problem talking tracer call. don’t answer phone people don’t know I’m probably calling anyone back... think contact tracing app line people use phones today. week went knowing anyone former co-worker hospital dad sister getting infected. closing fast. official name, agreed Pfizer BioNTech, ""Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine."" 
 
That's name two companies agreed name submitted EUA. 
 
But call whatever want. make sure include word Pfizer that's Pfizer (who charge advertising promotional materials, consent BioNTech) primarily using people may know referring leave Pfizer out. 
 
The purpose language understood making comments internet, faster say Pfizer vaccine. 
 
Really though, I'd like interject moment. BioNTech able create help Sahin Tureci, children Turkish immigrants. really called Sahin Tureci + Turkey + Germany + BioNTech + Pfizer vaccine. Fortunately even vaccinating small number elderly vulnerable people wonders ICU capacity. Yup never forget March 5 coworkers walk job wear masks, fast forward today it’s much better. half employees wear mask noses walked socially distanced break room day someone dragged 5 chairs yeah living rural fucking sucks  McDonald’s gives side effects number cases really outside normal prevalence understand, may may risk vaccine. simply unknown necessarily considered risk. work experience jumping ship every couple years arguing inflation payrises beat $12. real pay rise $2/5 years inflation (40¢/year) thinking thing. Especially O'hare looking packed Thanksgiving well. I'm trying complain much. Perhaps mask usage kept transmission rates low enough people socially distanced. Weird  Surely manufactures capability produce mRNA vaccines, right? Also, isn’t one vaccines mRNA? Wow, asshole. get rare virus inadvertently pass someone’s grandmother? grandparents? get killed? Wear. The. Mask. Forever. It’s difficult. gives baskets street value.

someone gonna get robbed. already know know. says he's feeling saying fall deaf ears. we’re wearing masks we’re also anything doesn’t require degree social distancing simply happening. pack animals congressional beings case needs majority outweigh needs minority. I’m really sorry genuinely believed getting dragged another year, simply isn’t that’s reality. Another year much ask. I’m sorry, you’re unreasonable. Actually can. takes awful lot money governments refuse spend. Lmfao. data whatsoever. become given alot rights year. even naive people believe anyone read document AMA saying considering rescinding statement physicians prescribe Hydroxychloriquine patients early treatment covid I'm commenting gave kinda quote addresses what's going America lack people believing science. can't comment Britain since I'm there. remember woman Britain (I'm sorry forgot name) said get vaccine cause free could hear America's shockface. state run ICU beds.  even calling anything question arguing. guess fault asking advice internet people probably better qualified answer things am. Same. People sound like they're chewing marbles can't hear people speak on.  didn’t mean covid, lol. you’re still right, survival doesn’t absolve duty get people sick could communicate ideas better educate me, maybe next pandemic would better know bet give back American's money anymore. 

Since vaccine bet going draggg alllll everyone get vaccinated. I’m saying “enforce control people’s lives.”

But we’re finally people come work even they’re slightly sick better giving people sick days - thing while. 
We allowing people work home jobs could done fully virtually - could lead convenience people reduce emissions. 
We people realizing essential people whose jobs usually look wanting better work conditions. 
We getting comfortable video meetings could save lot time people instead needing drive somewhere short meeting doesn’t need person. 
This may lead fewer exotic meat wet markets possibly encroaching animals’ habitats. 

I don’t think things go back. Plus think masks still used people colds/flus still go like Japan. don’t get snark. It’s factual report side effects. Folks know expect take it. course take it. haven’t seen anyone thread say otherwise. feel yah, I’m pissed probably half social circle coworkers vocal vaccine, see articles like double down. much herd immunity. government dickhead Same, would gladly go first. Yeah keep telling might need accept idea covid tbh. type thing going happen, especially since vaccine shipped batches individual doses It’s crazy many people throw caution wind name ‘family.’ anything showing care family risking health.

Like said it’s one Christmas. Gathering gambling one good holiday dozens future ones. typed 2 sentences. didnt strain anything point one contained fact contained question. Perhaps lightweight. I'm means Olympic athlete I’m going say bartender shutdown state, would absolutely love things get back normal-ish. Impossible get infected RNA. Dude. ever gotten Polio shot? 
You’re getting live virus injected yourself, silly goose encourage get vaccine instead? I’m last group, get it, available everyone. get people can’t medical conditions, vast majority people get Don’t care. want life back I’ll take side effects long live stop existing. They’ll data late January likely submit analyses within week that. fda two week rigmarole. take Oxford vaccine, top Pfizer vaccine. According Bill Gates, next 4-6 months worst, wanna get first. coming year since I've seen parents hope see late spring. I'm probably going wearing mask public next two years. feel naked without it. A.) Pointing reducing deaths reduce transmission rates fear-mongering

B.) Pointing longer convalescence period results higher hospitalization load spreading misinformation

I'll try explain one time. know actual recovery times Covid-19, want help dialogue progress, would helpful information soundly defeat argument.

I 100 beds Covid patients. takes (hypothetically) 10 days die Covid. takes (hypothetically) 15 days fully recover released bed different location care. 

Now, means factor patients beds, 15 day window, 100% patients survive recover, treated 100 patients. Great. Amazing. Well done. However, 10% patients die, 10 beds free day 10, allowing treat additional 10 patients. remove timeline, see patients take longer recover expire, reduces overall capacity hospital. also note death rate goes up, hospital able treat people.

The take away simply turning 97% deaths mild cases solve burden hospitals. Yes, need treatment nearly level ICU treatment would otherwise. Fantastic. change sheer volume people treated. people treated Covid vulnerable categories. highest transmission rates 20s 50s. high death rate groups.

Your argument vaccinating vulnerable cut deaths 97% enough misinformation. next step logic is, ""If reduce death rate, reduce restrictions!"". 100% false absurd. Solving deaths solve pandemic. Solving transmission solve deaths pandemic. government protect vulnerable, yes. also work slow transmission like contract it.  I’m seeing 2.1k deaths projection vs 1.7k rapid roll-out February 14th, 20%. nothing, huge. look “easing restrictions” model, absolutely dwarfed potential increase deaths start getting (even more) complacent. think mandating vaccine especially Roe v. Wade decision would challenged Supreme Court ultimately overturned.

It already challenged dicta. asserting SCOTUS reverse prior decision (of course, one things makes people angry SCOTUS, reversing decision protect people pandemic? Pshaw). remember halftime show? work vaccine research notion -80 freezers crazy BS. Every hospital, lab, basically place handles clinical samples tons -80 freezers. like rare unheard of. Blue suit guy mad skills. Anyone US ""nurse"" little weeks couple hundred dollars. Would know take someone's temp, pulse blood pressure? Congrats! hired! Mostly years time distance Here's link anyone  Block vaccine access.

The term nobody wants hear right knew would surface thats fucked world is. enough 100,000 end month (both Pfizer Moderna). US secured 100 million people full treatment. Neither company guarantee US additional doses June 2021. leaves 228 million Americans without dose right now. No, vaccine made people shed polio virus year taken. highly recommend looking it- it’s relevant covid vaccine (completely different mechanisms) it’s interesting nonetheless. (in AZ). knew co-worker presumptive case spring back testing restricted. Since really know anyone it. Even summer wave know anyone it. wave? go much year need make trip pet shops town get feeders tarantulas reptiles. Two employees one shops tested positive last week, days talked one ~10 minutes (we wore masks). wife work thing weekend (otherwise working home last month) couple people thing since tested positive. yeah, bubble shrinking. remember spring reading study former smokers hit harder COVID, current smokers hit less hard. know true study remains found interesting time. theory current smokers nicotine would bind ACE receptors something (I really know, i'm scientist) would prevent COVID able bing parts lung. wonder follow studies done since Please love good need send kids school man. Lol guy retarded Thank you. Yes, spike simply primary infections Thanksgiving. Sturgis took 6 weeks cascade control midwest. Yes can. Learn it. common vaccinated, rather Pfizer test scientist going say know Pfizer vaccine stops transmission.

That said, Pfizer Moderna similar there's really good chance also works expected. good conservative never lets facts get way throwing good superiority complex around calc wrong. bought home 360k. Prop taxes $4500 CA Sure, property tax amounts greater due values, pay 10% sales tax $10 item someone Hawaii pays 4% $100 item say Hawaii's sales tax higher. comparing possible vaccine side effects death rate covid. pretty unfair. fair comparison would long term damage vaccine vs long term damage covid.

And know even healthy fit people, even survive disease, side effects shown up. People unable taste smell months getting sick. Singers enough lung capacity passion anymore. Athletes constantly fatigued. many stay permanent? else may show 5 years future?

I much afraid long term damage covid - disease around year - small chance vaccine side effects, absolutely take soon possible.

Also, less personal safety responsibility towards community: Getting covid means spread it. That's really makes afraid. little bit sick, killing grandma immune-compromised friend. afford adjustments, look ergonomic positions. Even gotta get adjustable tray table get height keyboard mouse right, make huge difference. stack monitor books get height right.

Keyboard trays even better ergonomics usually involve DIY installation also money (not mention crappy desk). course ergonomic keyboards, also cost money (but cheaper eBay) take time adjust using.  Without providing much info, public transportation company. Making state better completely back burner entirety Holcomb fucks off, weed goons state government, legalize tax marijuana. absolute baseline minimum improve state. Nothing else even started least reach baseline. LA danger turning NYC? Shit.0 see enough doses ready timeline, hoping proved wrong! Seems like people capacity nuance... like... changing perspective new information... that's real plague society right now. Everyone little wrong start, people ridiculously wrong. There's shame stubbornness. work hospital. official policies COVID-19 rule positive patients course, unwritten rule assume everyone positive. think speak people also say ""i trust science"" well, dont trust politics..... Interesting. guess allure one-stop solution might stronger suspected. case, know people totally okay masks, distancing, etc., reluctant get vaccine. Pepperidge farm remembers fucking nerve people. think want take fucking kids see Santa shit? Pure assholes lot. Germany shutting down, Merkel says 'we're big trouble', 5 week shutdown Germany, Christmas New Year's celebrations Oh ahhh geez. hard. posted I've reverted weird anorexic-type behaviors, largely remedied previous this. Another fun thing alcoholism. eating, might well make calories somehow, right? (/s course, but...) compress words smallest idea person I've ever met. Vietnam Taiwan? I'd say they've done better start finish above. yup agree trying say *lack* equipment bearing number deaths?

You're still completely ignoring original point, SOURCED, federal government confiscating equipment ordered states president less authorized order said leaving states handle themselves. instead gone fully cocked completely red herring argument, point longer fucking conversation am. refuse continue badgered red herring, demand address original point, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEALING STATE IRDERED HEALTH EQUIPMENT PANDEMIC.


...If not, kindly fuck off. time bullshit. Post-Christmas New Year's going horrendous. get car crash or, god forbid, diagnosed cancer. Thanks numbers. makes wonder kind jobs people company do? work tech company CA ~350 people. 2 cases since March far. remember wildfires? Mask wearing become norm pandemic. that’s doubt many people continue especially don’t symptomatic illness. ink everywhere, want ink hands, clothes, mask, face, inside home

Wait, what? invisible ink fit equation here? bit crazy rural Midwest. Huge majority believe it. I've patients die hard convince ones believe now. local county vote mask mandate one person voted young guy 1 year old cancer! him, ""it's God's hands"". Yikes. Awesome! Good luck!  zero evidence spillover resulted lab mismanagement, considerable evidence that.

The Huanan market? Reexamination early reports made clear first recognized cases city Wuhan exposure Huanan market. well-informed belief among scientists virus circulating Wuhan human population earlier, November last year least, likely human—not wild animal—carried Huanan market. market seems site superspreader event December, probably site spillover animal. think today another record day  Actually multiple mRNA vaccines got far clinical trials, weren’t approved (due efficacy, safety - safety profiles fine). speed vaccination directly protecting vulnerable going far outpace reckless behaviors result point-A-to-Z spread communities. Assuming near-100% vaccination nursing homes, possible mid-January, we'll nearly halved actual potential deaths/hospitalizations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying continued precautions prudent, need year studies prove effective vaccines (unless entire global public health community lying us). raw numbers cases severity sufficient persuasive fence taking vaccine worried could get transmit someone vulnerable. Kinda sus ngl feel like argument word only, practice. work, example, ""shipped doses vaccine expected"" begin vaccinating employees want today. includes employees young lowest risk working home 100% time currently. So, clearly ""line"" he's jumping really exist individual company/hospital decide distribute vaccines receive. Unfortunately, follow recommendations, won't, like mask-wearing sadly. Probably walkthrough check people give moral support.

Day-to-day work involves deciding fund labs, choosing hire oversee labs, reviewing development strategies middle managers.

Imagine breakout people made critical decisions stop working replaced? could easily delay development future projects, “avoid cutting line”. shills

You Keep Using Word, Think Means Think Means.gif That's... no, that's no. zero second jail term type crime. 

It's fine, move on. bit dumb thing drawing objection though. person person might getting different votes MVP, give crap either way... dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* insurance company mandate thought 100M each, totalling 200M doses 100M vaccinated Americans. read study see actual data safe effective approved tons different countries independent review board. Who's ahead pool third vaccine approved? Lmao. That's pretty American response. ""We need take action! Shoot everyone face!!!!"" 

That's definitely said thank making laugh ass I've even gotten bed. vaccine prevent getting sick. enough data collected know still able spread virus. Never seen stuff except internet.

I think deal buggy products want see whether it’s safe. Hell yeah! people say RR wasnt Green Day, always laugh! possibly blatant political album ever. wish saw then, really began listening right tour. Apple replay says 335 hours Green Day year😅 pretty much caught rock hard place here. 

Take vaccine look like skip ahead queue don’t take make look like don’t trust product. Ok, here's Iceland 60%. fully concede wrong saying ""25%"". might something saw particular population, likely older.

I would point case cite news article relatively young student population, tends less symptomatic. Also, seems screening without follow-up, vast majority people asymptotic *at time test*, whether developed symptoms later. would trust Iceland paper more, population study. talking vaccines sciences dumb. mean scientists made research found eating feces would prolong life, would believe that?    
There tons scientists making nonsense researches publishing them. Science absolute truth everything watch psychomaniac scientists say eating feces cure flu gonna it. first get vaccine. pretty big fucking deal. New normal crew ain’t happy. fucking tired

I'm tired especially anecdotal stories politicians celebrities experience it. Tell us statistics what's happening communities instead. Im uk either. would someone post health worker said believes science? Like shit sherlock people's opinions article? Someone know used show getting vaccine. says says meant prevent infection supposed tp limit minor symptoms virus, major ones ones require hospitalization. Well, like 15-20x many healthcare workers nursing home residents. Still, also doubt optimism quotation. want visit hug elderly relatives! Massachusetts-based Moderna said vaccine remains stable 36 46 degrees Fahrenheit, temperature standard home medical refrigerator, 30 days. stored six months negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit. comparison, Pfizer’s vaccine requires storage temperature minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. silly clearly PR move. You’re executive multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company developed groundbreaking vaccine produce countless amounts instead decide “not cut line”? icing cake positive view creating company. 

You can’t prove didn’t take hand actually didn’t that’s worrisome “heart warming”. think it’s didn’t want cut imaginary “line” doesn’t exist someone position ridiculous. really didn’t take yet it’s likely CEO pharmaceutical company... one right mind would take vaccine general roll proves truly safe effective. 

The fact we’re commenting discussing serious statement win PR land. Great job Pfizer marketing team 👍 vaccine approved US UK. approved ""emergency use"". EU trying achive regular approval takes days longer. I'm sure that's politicians thought masks scenario. ""We'll tell use supply chains longer disrupted tell truth helpful."" went well. longer wait piles bodies streets. blood hands. I’m sick beurocrats playing life death. need vaccines, less, strong legally binding mandates ensure everyone forced take high elerly vulnerable vaccinated, that's point. far truth article says equipment diverted, people died it. dispute first, would expected huge news people Colorado dying droves lack equipment. ""I \[have firm belief reliability of\] \[the systematic study structure behavior physical natural world observation experiment.\]""

Her statement perfectly coherent give people benefit doubt speaking cuff.  entire thread insane. thought anti vaxxers didn’t trust big pharma CEOs? somehow CEO getting vaccine first would surely sway science deniers among us, it’s civic duty! Oh since hasn’t gotten vaccine won’t either, he’s obviously informed me!

It’s impossible find logic. hello wave three. america takes 4th step daily new cases stairway like chart, europe breed uk variant wave three expiriencing spain variant 2nd wave. 1st wave closely tied chinese wild-type variant, hops europe arrived americas. 

do cull infected, or? rip minks /S want able give homies bro hugs hell would even better duet : Reddit hates successful people Shady fuck, y’all mind think multi millionaire ceo pharma company giant like Pfizer gives fuck cutting line vaccine. Like others mentioned it’s better PR stood behind product since much distrust vaccine. pharma companies sure hell don’t care cutting line price gouge people life saving drugs 😂 youre CEO major pharma company probably don’t associate anti-vaccine people dont run jnto often living rich bubble. 

Hooo bro antivax super popular among rich educated. 

Your picture typical antivaxxer probably skewed. Source: average anti-vaxxer probably think — Quartz days longer

*few weeks longer refrigerated normal fridge like vaccines 5 days, it’s difficult. Hard start revolution can’t go walk without tripping bodies Agreed...I meant Congress biggest concern use younger, healthy portion population. Nearly every medication contraindications: eat grapefruit taking this, anyone Xanax check doctor taking this, people Mediterranean ancestry may experience effects, sort thing.

Those side effects time research uncover. permanent isolation, opinion isnt really relevant general population. Yeah fine contact anyone years, yeah go ahead wait long term effects. point is, generally speaking, people taking stupid risk getting vaccine waiting long term effects covid much worse. emergency procedure can't used EU basis, nationally. 

So countries like France Germany deliberately refraining vaccinations name ""bloc solidarity"". Also, Pfizer forced millions Americans bankruptcy (or buses Canada) due prescription drug price cartel?

Fuck guy red hot poker. literally makes *thousands hour* exploiting sick, probably afford isolate rented tropical island servants forces wear bio-hazard suits presence comfortably sips martinis.

But he's good guy redditors ""doesn't want cut line"". Everything cost. case it’s 1 dose (times however many people need demo - note American gov taking doses too. Fauci Obama may video build trust) going people need it. comes time general vaccinations, it’s fine go skeptics. hundreds thousands people gotten it, skeptics probably less so. FYI, emergent situations always covered “in network” insurance. It’s law. even known cause GBS? 


How sure it’s due flu shot Anyone isn’t rushing vaccines blood hands swam years would likely die. form fine all, need cardio go hours straight. guy mind thinking big deal. Hell, America partially ruled Russian corporate elite! Last week, one night pharmacy 12 bags Precedex stock 52 ICU beds. nailbiter.

I agree you, communication patient family members remote hardest part. many families understand patient intubated, probably never come vent. exhausting. someone needs work wants social distance outside work, option that. Employers protect employees workplace people need work. People choose want personal time. Statistically likely die virus vaccine. obvious choice. Curious lady England faring vaccination. supposed birthday soon iirc. Trouble finding information WWW. Slaoui said something along lines 20,000,000 vaccinated December, 30,000,000 vaccinated January, 50,000,000 vaccinated February. Would amazing ends achieving this. 164 subjects placebo got covid, 11 vaccine group got Covid Sounds like good way start revolution print money. times war problem allocating manufacturing make tanks, etc. bottleneck excuse. need many vaccines humans extinct find better solution. war covid, shutting everything isn’t producing vaccines food bodies stop piling streets friend, every year new medicine medical device recalled science wrong. Nobody smokes uses tobacco products get COVID vaccine. give shit bodies, valuable vaccine wasted them. get sentiment dude really take first wave. going give way lot anti-vax conspiracies saying companies CEO wont take it. Lol serious right now? One pool lap 50m, mile 1500m, one mile 30 laps local olympic pool. multiply 12.

A good high school swim time 500 4 minutes, talking 36 times. slow 500 someone competent take 6 8 mins calm pool. That's 2 3 hours straight swimming even accounting rough seas currents.

Anyone trained likely dying. cannot wait available bat facility. truly hope get first dose Christmas. Double digit percents population gotten virus. It’ll still get us need be. Kids carriers. required school. work it’s there’s lot nurses kids they’re concerned breast feeding isnt, wouldnt tested aply permit several times, denied based ""just rules hhhughh!"".

Now, desperate proclaim someone complete asshat online despite facts matter means guess what?

Projection mate.

Dont mob mentality cringy asshat. Wait, aren’t seeing sorts goals countries? seems like good thing declare scared getting covid, vaccine drawing line? right move without doubt. FDA could excused political climate America. absolutely asinine three weeks behind approval Pfizer, many countries already approved it, peer reviewed paper phase 3 out. Waiting gaining anything right now. U use hammer sickle Well, also plenty people willing take spots. fight fight. I'm going lean towards Fallout. skeptics putting everyone else harms way past 8 months? Nah, fuck them. End line. Lol dozens polio outbreaks caused polio vaccines recent years Even true, course not, real man would take one team. He'd take vaccine wife girlfriend would somewhat protected. Every person childbearing age plus women infertile plus women want kids plus men would plenty enough people vaccinated provide immunity. conspiracy theory *yet*.

Or hell, might be. I'm like 12 hours late party. understand way better seem think. honest even realize first written ""political leaders"" instead ""medical experts"" took understanding ""liars"". Lol.

But point Fauci least ADMITTED knew essentially lying, PPE shortage felt justified. don't. Many others don't. problem incompetence, integrity. Anti-vaxers gonna run hard. likely get false negative false positive. day 1 day 4, go 100% 67% false negative. best odds 5 days. 

 [When tested? | MIT study examined false-negative rates post-exposure, found four days infection prior symptom onset, **the probability false negative PCR test went 100 percent Day 1 67 percent Day 4**. even day individuals began showing symptoms, false negative rate still 38 percent, dropping 20 percent three days symptom onset. Of course, much depends the sensitivity of particular test used. MIT Medical using a test that shown **false-negative rate less 5 percent five days post exposure.** get back “if can’t understand conversation” part. mRNA vax passed trials humans? I'll probably get downvoted would lying say 100% trust vaccines early, encouraged released desperately. certainly HOPE good claimed, some. Probably looking late January/early February rate. They’re fully enrolled single shot get results lot quicker  far ridiculously optimistic. saying back normal February. 

Guys, time come back reality. don’t nearly enough doses herd immunity summer. Maybe, MAYBE herd immunity achieved 2022. 40% country still refuses take vaccine. Cant achieve herd immunity folks refuse take vaccine first place. No, takes days viral replication happen, swab pick up. get tested day 2, swab negative regardless whether infected not. See Updated research say accurate testing days 0-4 days symptoms onset, 89% reliability. See study Due incubation periods, symptom onset date vary. estimated peak infectiousness day either day symptom onset day right (when people still feeling perfectly fine) bitchy, UK general saw think highest terms pre-vaccine Europe. get virus. waited majority 44k get covid, significant portion general not-in-a-trial population would contracted covid time well, analyze data enough cases provide reasonable amount statistical power, happens relatively small proportion participants gotten sick. That’s...what vaccine does. Uhh... one day thing. given 50 kids, likely hours.

They going spreading others hours first exposure. Unfortunately actual people like that. Yeah, like said... I’m vaccine, makes feel little bit suspicious top executive company made vaccine taken it... think problem is, least biggest I'm seeing, people fundamentally understand small molecule drugs work, side effects arrise, vaccines different small molecules. dumb. I’m pretty pro vaccine normally I’m paranoid taking brand new vaccine technology. idea long term side effects could yet. personally going taking mRNA shot instead wait Oxford release trust old vaccine technology completely ive utilizing thst life. You’re smooth brain suspicious safety It’s really absurd weary *speed* thing only, it’s absurd weary reason. moon landing science, race time. fucked like 3 launches got right, even final Apollo mission problems. I’ll first line vaccine idgaf, understand weariness. You’re assuming problems nature purposeful racists vendetta, villain laughing twirling mustaches. 

More often treatments harm minorities adequately included clinical trials research experience adverse effects different proportion. large body evidence minorities women experience significant disparities healthcare dismiss people’s concerns things telling don’t understand experiences, you’re ignoring science backs think experience universal. fully agree need much distancing, stop traveling wear masks. 

But think production bottleneck excuse. country would love get hold vaccines right save economy simply enough yet.

Making tanks bullets also took years ramp production quality far ideal. 30% bombs failed explode example. Tanks often broke down. common group 40 tanks drive somewhere arrive 35 tanks, rest cannibalized repair others.

But war indeed. death rate year high since WW2 many countries now. also many people long term health effects. 

On top economy gutted, cause many deaths suffering years come people already precarious situation.

It's sad state affairs... find daily update summary post Sweden Daily Discussion Post also find archive daily update &amp; summaries [in post (I'll adding links new comments time there) duhhh rate wonder “Science” going file tax exemption. rate wonder “Science” going file tax exemption. maybe wanna take cause he's apprehensive deaths, bell's palsy appendicitis happening result vaccine. likely not. healthy people takes \~1.5 week gain immunity since first infection, much effect. 


Also, logic - vaccine injects RNA produces part virus get immune system ready. moment hospital, already enough parts virus floating by, likely antibodies well - need time kill virus. Injecting additoonal virus parts patient body would give antibodies extra jobs profit. basically, vaccines went beyond set do? focusing actual, tangible outcomes statement. Stop trying draw box around avoid admitting truth. prioritize 'irresponsible' ?! Yeah, people still think, scientific method consists going around measuring arbitrary stuff extrapolate arbitrary way, end proves assumptions initially began with.

This circulus vitiosus momentary results sold legitimate form ""science"". bet tune would change instantly CA properties shut down. Careful, gestapo watching!! idea id rather get cause derision need right now. Translation : “As faith government society’s ability control viral spread wanes, confidence vaccine surprisingly rises.” drive Santa. Santa mic'd up, taped kids' lists car, elves took peek reported back Santa, talked kids distance.

They fucking rapt. Nothing lost forced stand long line awkwardly sit stranger's lap. got see magical gift giving hero great add libbing. ""Oh think know elf named (kid name) workshop, hardest workers!"" etc. Kids ate up, nobody put huge risk getting sick. 

This normal year. People need accept stop pushing normalcy face overwhelming risk spreading highly contagious, sometimes deadly virus. 

There things work around probably skip. It'll ok, temporary. We'll get back normal near future pull together less stupid right now. don’t understand it. Mississippi Christian. seems like best way follow Christ would protect neighbor. always wear N95 everywhere. haven’t restaurant since March. way fellow Mississippians responded baffling.

When's early approval data likely J&amp;J? know locally started trials couple weeks ago. virus raging hard currently placebo group getting infections relatively quickly.  
To seems like going biggest step. one shot (probably), assume manufacturing get approval dumping 10s millions supply once. Two weeks approval date probably see first significant decline virus numbers. Sounds like santa handing lumps covid instead coal year Yes. particularly awful rumor going around saying vaccine could sterilize women (something MRNA rewriting placenta carry children something). Yet reports covid affecting fertility “fear mongering.” I’m glad they’ve finally gotten around caring us women childbearing age, I’ll take chances vaccine, thanks. don’t real lockdowns. It’s “getting killed Republicans” fatigue. Sadly world live in. Food Drug Administration authorized first COVD-19 vaccine late Friday, high-ranking White House official told agency’s chief could face firing vaccine cleared day’s end Same. I’m also go person family questions since I’m PhD candidate biomedical sciences. There’s much misinformation right it’s hard people sift believe freedom. want wear seat belt, feel free. want get vaccinated, go it. want exercise, it. justification tell anyone else wear mask get vaccinated tell get vaccinated wear mask. understand maybe go migrate North Korea see much fun have. office maskless, I’m setting foot till I’m vaccinated.

**It also points long-known structural shortcomings elderly care.**

**""For shortcomings, incumbent government - like previous governments knowledge - bears ultimate responsibility,"" says.**

""Elderly care unprepared ill-equipped deal pandemic."" Corona Commission summarizes overall assessment spread infection elderly care.

On Tuesday, presented first interim report authorities politicians handled corona crisis focus care elderly.

It noted what, addition general spread infection society, greatest impact number sick deceased elderly care based long-known structural shortcomings.

""These shortcomings meant elderly care unprepared ill-equipped deal pandemic. employees elderly care large extent left alone handle crisis situation "", stated 300-page report.

**In spring, government authorities** implemented number measures reduce risks spread infection elderly care - far late, Corona Commission states.

""We believe measures also insufficient several respects,"" says.

It written ambition Swedish strategy, especially protect elderly, real - succeeded.

""Although Sweden, comparison countries, alone large number deaths elderly care, nevertheless clear part strategy far failed.""

**Under heading ""Responsibility shortcomings"" is** pointed structural shortcomings elderly care known long virus outbreak.

""For shortcomings, incumbent government - like previous governments knowledge - bears ultimate responsibility. government governs country therefore removed initiatives needed elderly care better equipped crisis kind. ""

The National Board Health Welfare Swedish Public Health Agency also criticized much focus healthcare first stage pandemic enough nursing homes many weak elderly people. Commission writes particularly reprehensible early knowledge disease particularly serious group.

“The Swedish Public Health Agency National Board Health Welfare immediately placed emphasis conditions special housing. assessment authorities sufficient overview problems shortcomings municipal elderly care. meant guidance work elderly care delayed. ”

**The Commission also makes comparison** elderly care Nordic countries finds Sweden stands negatively, among things lower level education among staff.

They believe medical competence elderly care needs strengthened propose, among things, requirements minimum education different occupational categories special educational initiatives.

It also written municipalities employ doctors nursing competence available special accommodation, around clock.

“This prerequisite for, among things, continuous access medical interventions form drips oxygen, also staff able receive support guidance nursing medical treatment. Furthermore, municipalities must implement language training initiatives care staff lack satisfactory language skills. ”

**It end June** government decided appoint review commission. purpose learn happened make international comparison relevant countries various measures taken effects.

No later 28 February 2022, present final report government, authorities, municipalities regions examined.

What long term side effects covid? always uncertainty science. use best information available run it.

If waiting science ""prove"" something, I'd like remind gravity still confident say Covid-19 vaccines standards vaccines

Within scope dangers disease itself? Yes confident.

As 4+ years, LOT time spent waiting approvals finding sufficient volunteers needed sample sizes. COVID skipped front line approvals reviews, problems gathering volunteers.

The fact happened quickly testament quickly things get done vacuum. implication corners cut like seem trying push hitting nail head religion quite literally holds people back makes dumber. secret, accept ""answers"" face value critical thinking research verify authenticity. susceptible bold face lies becoming apart foundation character. Full stop. vaccine research look good! Oh, guess probably watch msm - I'm sure are. problem get education, many nurses choose ignore due beliefs mention here. called inverted totalitarianism understand way better seem think. honest even realize first written ""political leaders"" instead ""medical experts"" took understanding ""liars"". Lol. point people know, lied. problem incompetence, integrity. Imagine many possible antibodies Ozzy might undiscovered diseases. trust science too. trust pharmaceutical companies either US government UK government. mention government entities ensure safety like CDC FDA also proven tools self-interested politicians. Unfortunately scientists work pharmaceutical companies I'm sure everything make safe vaccine. companies work however run CEOs scientists. think several reasons: 

- Setting new manufacturing facilities recruiting personnel exacting standards non-trivial. Capable staff particular could come expense efforts. 
- There’s also entire supply chain reagents, enzymes, manufacturing materials consider. assume manufacturers significantly ramped production stockpiled product anticipation. 
- Requiring coordinating effort governments private manufacturers legally logistically troublesome, least massive capacity required longer necessary vaccine fully deployed. 

That said, exactly Defense Production Act meant for, it’s unacceptable hasn’t invoked. far know manufacturing concerns driven entirely private sector, abroad. working within immediate long term financial limitations, medical urgency begging for. 

Long-term, mRNA tech distinct advantage nearly identical manufacturing distribution regardless product. Strategic public capability could justified, tech prove itself. that's ozzy already antibodies  single dose looks REALLY good. Wow. There's lot em, unfortunately. Ah, makes sense. Thanks privilaged

Check privilege.

^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author. come, seeing people seem dropped mentality adopted March...Gave up. I'm sure I'm getting downvoted seeking truth clearing confusion.

Because article outdated (published end *September*) relevant topic. Major pharma companies probably pay good money push idiotic anti-vaxxer narratives make people turn around point anti-vaxxers dumb obviously side corporations, corporations always back wrong, restaurants bars since thing started open country autumn arrived closed again. even managed go two vacations beach. (within country course, international travel yet).

But really miss night clubs havent one since february probably. Also, might start attenting team's games almost weekly basis. period fans allowed stadiums closed again. least games still going on, good portion weekly entertainment lol. Where's source says want it? would angry took it, hell would expect otherwise? Aside company’s vaccine, seen rich privilaged get better testing treatment.

You snuffed outrage paragraph. Reddit would livid rich guy cut line got vaccinated order, people wouldn’t give shit he’s Pfizer CEO. 

People going mad matter does, especially somewhere despises rich people else like Reddit. Yup sure they? dangerous saying??? 😂😂😂😂😂. Dude far anti-vaxxer bullshit gone? 

Its dangerous dude. understand? theory stems thinking completely wrong.

Damn bro Everyone constantly analyzed, get virus. Keep mind trial period goes long needs show vaccine effective. soon enough placebo people get infected compared vaccine group enough data say works. You’re right, there’s merit vaccine it’s difficult convince someone who’s opposed open mind. 

I think it’s unfair immediately judge someone who’s unsure right now. 

I see people jumping others slightest hesitation think that’s wrong. Attacking someone afraid unknown (at least him/her) isn’t going convince person it’s safe.

For many people, they’ve getting along fine wearing mask socially distancing themselves. That’s proven effective well. Maybe 94% effective, effective nonetheless. Given masks good fallback, think it’s fair people continue taking measures they’re comfortable getting vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mind mandating normalizing mask wearing super crowded indoor settings like public transit, flights, concerts. Aside that, seems bit overkill non pandemic scenario. None said implied forcing anyone else wear mask future flu season. said would, personally. appreciate thought ridiculous wearing one future since it’s part become accustomed year (like already normalized Asia). attempt made guilting anything. Peer review means PhDs field looked data commented it.

The FDA comprised PhDs field. would absolutely say peer reviewed data. What? 18 months new vaccine optimistic timeline. we're seeing new vaccines rolling fast nothing short one greatest accomplishments human history. several public firings healthcare workers since start pandemic speaking out.

Shortage healthcare workers norm. Protecting image norm. Dismissal speaking still norm. bc it’s first one post vax release. hasn’t studied that, everything I’ve seen says still work. people claiming hospitals full human rights need restricted. needs approach point patient safety/life expectancy reduced significantly justify NPI measures. Beyond overworked, approaching unsafe. 

This one hospital. Maybe it’s one better ones, I’m saying it’s bad take you’re forcing public draconian restrictions. Bad optics best.  Swore need see mouth bring facial connection together. say people fake emotions eyes, also entire face. actually harder fake eyes long enough window. That's assuming identify 7 people every person documented infected. future benefit lifelong refusal live Hicksville, USA *also* means deal COVID outbreaks, I'll take it. ignore countries strict lockdowns clearly worked. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good like showing face I’m 2022 there’s active pandemic it’s flu season. getting hand.  tests; well yes actually no. pretty unethical test pregnant women though. dont know many pregnant women would volunteer children guinea pigs possible lifelong complications death. sad still case 2020. think one talking about, I'm mind-blown moment way back answer: optimism bias poor scientific literacy country. completely fine forced vaxx? mean downside goodies innit? Tou still say no, travel, work etc.

You think that's normal. thought psychopath. let's real, eradicating smallpox would impossible idiots around. Hell, polio fucking things making comeback last years. tbh think already got want admit ""cut line"" actually think would *increase* confidence I’m exhausted all. aren’t anti-vax people exhausted? aren’t tired give reason? How?! like records never broken, they're always ""shattered"". Wow. Thanks info. I'd still rather risk Bell's Palsy covid, good know risk. Yeah figured honest I’ll take whatever get. It’s better getting Rona. think prudent thing open things continue require masks. enough statistical evidence truly achieve herd immunity, start relax mask measures. surprised like many countries Asia, people forever wear mask larger numbers.  personally know 9 people got never reported infection. know got person living catch corona test needs hassle bill. Awww say aint so, talk show host Dr Fauci.

Imm go see Dr Oz say well. input also value want hang coffee shop talk people. That’s you’re white male. there’s equality need highlight black female achievements. It’s especially important emphasize vaccines. Black people disproportionately affected Covid19 time understandable resistance getting vaccinated. highlighting achievement black, female scientist even important. Wonder we'll able request moderna vaccine others. I've read one appears effective easier administer others. probably enough drop R 1 restrictions lifted.

While may prevent lot hospitalizations, old make small fraction infected.

It touch R value. totally separate things. Positivity good us consider anti vaxxers people may reluctant take one specifically. Also lot economic consequences whole thing still around ""going back normal"" may make seem like things instantly disappear ultimately make effort fix broken. 

Still, trying cautiously optimistic. Look wearing mask reduced something different like flu. it’s COVID thing, masks something expect see patients workers medical facility. Seems like common sense courteous thing do, without COVID.  capacity, businesses poses public health threat results people hospitalized, held liable put business. people think desire income supersedes public health mind blowing. Please downvote me, good faith question know answer to:

 anyone info long mRNA vaccines stay body? imagine foreign mRNA likely targeted easily innate miRNA siRNA. America prefers billionaires health. Impressive, huh? little matchbook girl......


Fucking heart wrenching. 

Sorry post reminded lol negotiate terrorists. Take shit. Thats reason give instead. *My time shine* Someone say though vaccinate elderly (70+ so), reduce load hospitals half current rates. rate younger people hospitalized, would take insane amount population get infected overload hospitals point.

The hospitals half full younger people (not ICUs), that's make something like 80% cases, depending data looking at.

Check worldometers want numbers. Oh, figured second first dose counted single package. Ok. mass produce shit lets standby. Plus whatever cocktails put together....  1/3rd Gofundme's requests medical expenses. could one largest healthcare insurers point. would vanishingly unlikely help I'm willing say ""no"" one. Except tested pregnant breastfeeding women. They’re completely different technologies. AstraZ can’t start manufacturing Pfizer’s vaccine. Gotcha. wondering legality/ possibility might play out. actually think would good idea. think people US deserving worthy saving anything. crazy anti vax. 

You’re making decisions based zero evidence. actually mountains evidence contrary. I'd agree that.

I also think whole ""watch this"" show work anymore. many politicians done clearly safe. 

Obama flew Flint Michigan, drank tap(?) water, declared water safe, left. Today, years later, Flint's water bad media saw hot topic.

John Hickenlooper drank (supposed) fracking fluid argue safe frack near well water, see footage people lighting tap water fire hovering lighter next faucet.

So yeah, can't convince skeptics ""watch me"" show anymore. think reluctance hurts case though. pharma world super sociopathic. Personally think he's either already taken pretended pharma Jesus, believe product.

His wealth also puts safer environment Americans, nearly concerned happens *doesn't* take vaccine like rest US like guy listen podcast said. Him, wife, kids tested positive. sees free 30-60 day pass get airplane go somewhere. Theyll still wear masks go guidelines rules wherever go. They're putting anyone risk there. 

I know lot people worse especially front fighting this. we're getting still sucks. inside basically anything store since April. costly summer trying keep kids entertained home know that. indeed allowed make choice. complain services denied others choose differently. according Bill Gates wont til 2022 smart man, Mr Gates is. Like what? Nothing else warrants enforcing control people's lives way different 2019. Good. Even COVID way out, maybe decrease flu deaths. 

A mask big deal. good idea... idea done yet. hand, another year probably likely kill me.

I’m trying hang till spring, hanging next winter would different story able take legal action though, although good enough “excuse” fire you, may luck. Depending egregious is, might able find lawyer takes case contingency win. touch common sense decency. Ironic coming someone pretends care people... UK also approve it? every western democracy shortly. giant conspiracy? Awesome news let’s go wife worked similarly negligent establishment line, ""they can't prove got here!"".

That particular place serves clientele mainly 70s (its bar lol). Completely horrific.

She quit. Social distance minor inconvenience huh? don’t really know though, we? know March, don’t know exact rates reinfection long immunity lasts. possibly acquired data yet? completely useless statement without data lol. real surprised fact Canada approved quick emergency use swear remembered reading articles Canada's late party terms getting orders vaccines seems like that's case? hind sight traitor always traitor, even means killing 300,000 people ... counting Wow noble RemindMe! 6 months kind hope becomes common thing regardless pandemic, least certain places. Every time go doctor everyone mask, easy catch stuff prior COVID, shouldn’t change (the idea patients allowed good too). Yep. I've accepted happen. entire point completely disregarding restriction receive this, others. EU slow everything. love red tape. ordered vaccine last month, long UK USA put orders in. No. unreasonable. wasn’t rushed. Go read thousands articles explain this. Who’s Gianna? Remember anti mask protests people couldn’t go get haircut? think it’d massive scale. 

Still baffles masks really difficult thing people wear pandemic, digress He’s getting new information adapting projection. likely factoring first vaccines diminish symptoms, may anything mitigate transmission. 

That, layered conservative assumption vaccine adoption won’t super high right away, means he’s probably thinking masks required 2021 end pandemic.

In likelihood, people acting normal summer anyhow - regardless downgrade pandemic status then. terrible person many people think vaccine arriving today means ""I go Xmas shopping end week"" .

When try explain vaccine needs 2 shots, 29 days apart, turn half ful glass completely empty them. downvote. know downvoted, know answer question. example, think would useless vaccinate someone chicken pox already it. But, HPV, read studies getting HPV vaccine, even it, reduce chance causing cancer future. got mine. 

I see harm getting it, since would useless worst. Second hand embarrassment painful... Wait ones MH 370v hydrochloriquine bullshit pulled. time entirely likely he’d peddling effective, rushed nonsense easy win.

Luckily doesn’t seem like case here, vaccine &amp; Trump hand getting approved. current estimates expect around 70-80% general population vaccinated effective herd immunity. combine anti-vax population population people healthcare coverage (because consider healthcare human right country), we'll never reach herd immunity well least celebrities dont worry kind thing... Well, sounds small. friend mine pressuring go out, gave ""it's 1%"" line, looked said ""so saying care 1 100 chance getting infected?"" 

Anyone knows 100 people likely know someone dies COVID. ""get it"" now, best friend, spouse, parent, child, etc. Sweden worse most. Sorry fucking way Im wearing beach. Right, maliciously edited. telling 2020 payback slap? Seriously though, much shit year. want go somewhere grocery store. Lockdowns don’t work anywhere. cause economic devastation. never meant long term solutions Entirely possible let's also remember enough doses time fast roll vaccine. I'm optimistic April/May br starting return normality. I’m looking forward able switch comfortable mask I’m vaccinated lol. Kn95 plus eye pro ear pro hard hat ears bloody since March lol Still, mistrust, one governors (João Doria, Jr,, São Paulo state governor) presidential ambitions. vaccine candidate choice, Sinovac-developed CoronaVac, made people ideological arm Presidency (mostly followers so-called ""philosopher"" Olavo de Carvalho) concerned, simply vaccine developed China (and believe ""China knew everything"" ""was hiding crucial information"" virus weaken economies Western countries China first recovered could purchase Western assets cheap). Nothing vaccine change three months time. kinks work out. 

Also. thousands people already received vaccine months ago. That’s whole point fucking trials. Youre forced lot things job. feels strange awful. want fast forward April, Midwest finally thawed out, vaccine distribution full swing, orange freak nature White House. Literally exact boat. Moved back CA MO awesome job, rejoined friend group sad leave. entire state shut I'm back Missouri seeking shelter parents roommates care covid. cold here... MN told we’d getting vaccine cards. Masks aren’t meant permanent measure, won’t wear permanently. great news! can't wait till normal return. New Zealand, thats do. Maybe things back normal Easter XD Ignaz Semmelweis ridiculed suggesting people wash hands... ""I hope see friend shake hand. hope Pacific blue dreams. hope."" feel like vaccinate elderly first...Vaccination elderly bring death rate virtually zero. grocery store workers really getting priority elderly since grocery store workers essential? Bullshit. Antimaskers fuck things months yet. rosy projections always assume 90%+ mask adherence Still... media going due ""Impf-Trödelei"" (BILD. English, loose translation: ""vaccine dilly-dallying"") rubbing wrong way. Let check vaccine properly, cut corners. Fast track process, yes, cost thoroughness. They're dilly-dallying, they're finalizing approval process, should. recently 3 family members test positive. lack knowledge Covid astounding me. Everything quarantining meant could go get food drive long go anywhere, quarantine symptoms, tell person saw 2 days ago want know. Oh man.

Don't underestimate people turned TV going lives sensory deprivation goggles on.

Yes, tried correct problems best could.  city appeal process vaccine. Meaning, feel higher risk fill appeal form order see you’re eligible receive vaccine sooner rather later. might want check states health department website information. still carrier saying. one that's available. probably much choice good while. avoid getting tested unavoidable. Parents GA kids keep remote learning.

Edit: fixed shouty ""IN"" use quarantine sense stay home socially distant outside. extremely rare occasion me, anyone family, enter public building visiting anyone's house outside small circle table. mask mandate daughter's school work home. suggested actual quarantine periods infected believe enforced law. August 2022 August 2222? 
Because August 2021 optimistic.  Sure am, pal. Nice job.  would assume stopping children's parents congregating bars restaurants also cause significant drop Same. actually really mind much sort like circumstances. one breath complain regular people lost jobs, another ask pharmaceutical companies something would undoubtedly cause many regular people work lose jobs. 
Again, would great could sell vaccines cost (so still pay employees), don’t see circumstance happen. I’m telling it’s good thing, realistic. societies economies structured certain ways, going change overnight. 

It would foolish refuse vaccine simply company producing won’t give away free. nothing ethical that. Getting vaccine personal benefit public service, need critical mass people receive stop spread vaccine-injured family members done research past 10 years have. 

Ah, ok. missed part anti vaxxer Pfizer vaccine demonstrated continued efficacy safety vaccine individuals already infected. gone Moderna data yet (just released hour ago) can't imagine would different. extremely important continue wear mask. need social pressure wear mask remain people stop wearing mask population isn’t almost immunized, virus spread like wildfire among vaccinated Freeze sperm much fragile masculinity. trying since March/April... vaccinated still carry spread virus. able wear mask everyone vaccinated. Furthermore, know vaccine works long term. time tell. Ok, seems explain it. US ordered vaccines many different manufacturers case turn ineffective produce serious side effects. Since currently 80 vaccines clinical trials amounts awful lot vaccines. US let countries excess we’re done vaccinating population, it’s like we’re going vaccinate people multiple different vaccines. research required. hate media coverage always include that. would lose years unless utterly abdicating responsibility parent? 

My life great. Sorry isn't, triggered thin piece material. Normally get super annoyed jokes get repeated reddit, still laugh nearly every time one. Nah. Maybe still wear mask bus grocery store protect folks can't get vaccinated still need there, that's probably it. brother lives 20 minutes away I've seen twice since March, seen nephews all. want 4.5 year old able play cousins; want brother sister-in-law able hold 1 year old daughter. supposed able experience fun baby stuff us, grown much they've missed all. 

I looking forward life returning sense normalcy. Cerebral Palsy group disorders youd since childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

Bells Palsy rare alleviates time. good friend doctor cc. already moved first wave physicians usual roles accommodate covid-related needs. means primary care docs stacked moment, they’re carrying things docs temporary assignments. preparing months, still extremely stressful scary everyone working healthcare right now. 

Everyone- Please patient doctors nurses allied care staff encounter. appointment gets changed, don’t take - truly isn’t fault. g sake wear mask stay home possible... pretty soon going start seeing people dying couldn’t access care scare us all. Thing is, people (immunocompromised folks) suffer doubly antivaxxers wear masks retaliation antivaxxers. moral 'they won't' thing, rather 'our public health experts say will' thing. Neutralizing antibodies produced vaccine. antibodies almost mechanically (physically) hinder virus infecting cells. good response, theory, prevent virus replicating.

It depends specific neutralizing antibodies are, depends lot virus person (perhaps less so).

However, important note many believe t-cell response important sars-cov-2, would necessarily neutralizing would initiate immune response actively combat replication, meaning replication occur. 

I think need time draw conclusion vaccine specifically long term, since long term antibody levels go enough point potentially cannot neutralize. T-cell response still active though.

Source: Virologist, Epidemiologist works adaptive immune response. Glad people starting get vaccinated, hope anti-vaxxers ruin us government fuck things delay distribution vaccine.  Mask distancing mandates never taken down. possibility. “Science”  ID specialist hospital said least seasonal. said mask wearing hospital settings definitely going away. think businesses open we’ll need masked take rapid test entering. Depends infection rate area course. get we’ve already virus? got literally week dang thing came Well doctor made right decision. middle pandemic time nickel diming. three trillion dollar aid package went straight bailing airlines cruise ship companies. extra fifty billion make much difference compared that. bought enough every single potential vaccine either resold gifted excess less financially well countries like Canada planning do. Typical conservative mindset, pay enough money goods services pay less money let people die? increased economic activity adequate vaccine rollout would paid excess doses months anyway. government incredibly shortsighted. long term really mean “late presenting”. 

Long term means last ages.  vaccine made arm fall immediately injection would long term side effect you’re growing new arm.

However, we’d noticed trend arms falling off.  reasonable/logical possible side effects would occur pretty quickly.  mRNA broken within days.  proteins within weeks.  won’t anything around suddenly cause problem 5 years 30 years.  

Reasonable fears things like:

a) allergic reactions (because there’s always someone allergic something).  rapid onset.  General advice vaccine haven’t taken hang around clinic 15 minutes.  Especially history allergies. It’s standard safety.

b) auto-immune reactions - body makes antibody attack COVID protein, happens attack cells well.  present within 6 weeks.  Otherwise you’ve got explain body antibodies floating around didn’t actually anything years. (And that’s work.). common, we’d seen trials.  (Note - auto-immune reactions actually comparatively common viral infections.  documented various vaccines - fewer caused corresponding natural disease. It’s likely cases long covid auto-immune reactions.)

c) extremely rare auto-immune reactions actually happen within 6 weeks rare can’t statistically link vaccine 1 million people vaccinated.  key point they’d extremely rare - it’s way miss phase 2/3 testing.

Stop think things cause late presenting side effects.  Things like:

a) heavy metals asbestos body can’t get rid slowly cause damage.  Doesn’t apply mRNA protein creates short lived.

b) toxins/radiation causes cancer damaging DNA. Doesn’t apply here.  mRNA vaccine doesn’t get near DNA.

c) stuff like alcohol various meds eventually cause noticeable damage you’ve consumed years. Again, doesn’t apply vaccination isn’t something you’re every day years.

There’s logical mechanism vaccine cause side effect suddenly appears years later. Wow, almost like lot people forced get then, right? reaction rate exceptionally high (2/5,000 day’s administration vs avg vaccine reaction rate 1/1,400,000 doses), sample set 2 limited meaningfully extrapolate. Pfizer acted appropriately adding cessation administration strong allergic reaction histories, 2 reactions could caused something vaccine, otherwise coincidental. But, known reactions occurred, it’s best wait receiving vaccine strong allergic reaction history. Thank efforts moderate! Ozzy gets corona virus might fucked .. dude years antibodies built stage bat eating current vaccines require two doses, stage 2 trials (small sample size) something like 50 percent people sort antibody response 2 weeks first shot. yeah, even 2 weeks now, people currently got vaccine higher likelihood least suffering minor symptoms. Sure bro. stay locked basement. takes days longer.

How many days EU wait approval? point, it’s time put responsibility citizens rather solely administration (which terrible regardless). We’re point. POTUS issue lockdown, mandates, whatever stop virus... it’s public follow restrictions.

Even decent stimulus don’t see people staying home, going essentials, wearing masks go out... going family gatherings, seeing friends. People won’t it. 34% willing take now.

From [KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: December “**as soon possible**” group (34% public) say vaccine approved widely available, get soon can; “**wait see**” group (39%) say wait see vaccine working people getting vaccinated themselves; “only required” group (9%) say get vaccinated required work, school, activities; “definitely not” group (15%) say definitely would get vaccine, even free determined safe scientists. 

Most people ""**wait see**"" group probably due uncertainties surrounding mRNA EUA. EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) vaccine, BLA (Biologics License Application) vaccine. guess virus circled globe 1918 one would even noticed it. much lower death rate Spanish flu mostly affects people wouldn’t expected live much longer baseline. Also, life expectancy lower maybe wouldn’t even registered. 

The response virus could defining event. virus isn’t.

And that’s difference: life breathing (to me). “life cost”’person. forever state (masks distance) would care living.

Also - beinf asked social distance indefinitely (pushing farther rather demoralizing. reading Fauci article I’m honestly contemplating stopping together. month know it’ll summer 2022, fall, winter.) Unless work healthcare another similar industry, getting forced get vaccine. Lol Reddit serious mask fetish, it’s necessary absolutely hate People actually compassion position must depend simple gestures others could take (wearing mask) spare life. understand anyone sits justifies much hardship wear mask /little/ bit longer tapers vaccines distributed enough, immune-compromised. 

No one cater somebody else can't imagine people selfish fucking easy thing do. way. 0.00% chance. Let alone vaccinated people, people yet received vaccine say ""High-risk groups vaccinated, deaths down, open 100%"" 

So back normal around March, depending fast vaccinate everyone 70+. Covid time, without restrictions going explode. think 200K per day high, try 2-3 million per day. Lets hope vaccines reach people Covid does. Humidity could also factor. 78% Miami right 20% LA. Don’t think choice unless wanna wait till summer supply abundant understand selfish, lazy, weak willed, stupid, childish, cowardly 

lmao mods gonna this? /r/coronavirus someone worked Moderna’s vaccine, want make clear people worked isn’t big pharma. people overseeing data collection, myself, financial investment it. don’t make lose money based efficacy vaccine. Pharma contracts us serve unbiased point review.

What personal investment it. Almost everyone reviewed vaccine trials loved one get sick even die COVID, including myself, want nothing something effective actually good. Producing half assed vaccine wouldn’t us research side favors, honestly means paperwork. 

This vaccine child, heart soul, promise you’ll getting sum thousands scientists dedicating sleepless nights time away family. haven’t seen family since July bc travel research site. STILL can’t see February, close sites next month. 

Fuck 2020 cheers what’s come 2021! except said isn’t loose all. It’s direct quote.

 “And end January, enough health care workers first responders, enough Americans end March early April general vaccination programs.” (Alex Azar) month ago. Got mine October! felt bit weird close stranger indoors, feel good know I'm less likely get flu. Talk manager capitalism that. contributing extremely high transmission rates Start Wuhan don’t leave without answers. Edit: Wuhan laboratory would hope work hospital lot stupid people coming work here. Doctors nurses decades experience field don’t trust say half full shit. stand big pharma brain dead shills rest us avoid jab. Thanks stopping by. Obtuse is, then. Uncontroversial statement. government already admitted this.

What would interesting mandate actually look WHOLE strategy.

Not word high general spread society comnected infections elderly homes.

No comparison towards Nordic states retirement homes (same relative rate)

I also wonder members comission background medicine statistical analysis? selected them? foreign experts background outside Sweden domestic elite? walk outside stores naked barefoot? “Because fuck em’.. that’s why” -Dave chapelle Why? there’s pandemic literally point. Unless live somewhere Asia outrageous population density think cut virus spreading fast they’ll data quickly expected right. hard tell though covid hadn't. Also people get twice. one thing people can't apparently miss anything. Anywhere ten minutes ten hours. honestly find watch wrist annoying time. Pfizer rather difficult distribute especially developing countries. Thats oxford comes easiest three vaccines right terms distribution going huge factor developing countries thr cheapest another important factor developing countries. Also assuming oxford vaccine plant produce pfizer/moderna. Pfizer/moderna uses Mrna vaccines oxford simple switching around. pfizer plant could theoretically switch moderna since use method oxford. licencing issue. 

Also think putting eggs one two vaccines good idea. still data when/if vaccine gets approved teenagers. may end finding X vaccine efficient teenagers say adults elderly etc. may also find X people can't take X vaccine maybe due allergies take vaccine. gets eaten T-cell. 

For reason reading made think T-Rex, rest life, mental image body's immune responses going involve itty-bitty T-Rexes stomping around eating anything gets line. Thank that! :D add, someone worked Moderna’s vaccine, isn’t big pharma. people overseeing data collection, myself, financial investment it. don’t make lose money based efficacy vaccine. 

What personal investment it. Almost everyone reviewed vaccine trials loved one get sick even die COVID, including myself, want nothing something effective actually good. Producing half assed vaccine wouldn’t us research side favors, honestly means paperwork. 

This vaccine child, heart soul, promise you’ll getting sum thousands scientists dedicating sleepless nights time away family. haven’t seen family since July bc travel research site. STILL can’t see February, close sites next month. 

Fuck 2020 cheers what’s come 2021! nazis great scientists! Sure bro, we’ll continue social distancing 2026 least. Maybe 2030 we’ll go masked distanced concert. like Fauci really think we’ll reach number 60 year old mom california offered vaccine work, interacts regularly doctors nurses treat covid patients.

however, sketched fast development. anti vaxxer, would like ""wait bit"" taking it.

I've read ton mRNA vaccines work trust them.

what tell convince take it? same. use mask vacuum clean over. Cleaning detergents toxic. New Zealand small, racist island nation. doesn’t need crazy cold refigeration. That's joke, relief.

I want meet them.  get point. truth might damaging health. even work environment laws say wearing mask 3 hours avoided (changed 4hrs recently) risk health issues employee. guess making laws recommendations govt true science deniers...not! follow whatever recommend. masks needed outside indoors long keep 1m others (edit: words, mine). Simple that. 15 grandparents dead, lucky you! Uh huh, I'm sure thats reason Yeah believe Amazon complaints, know place better. friend worked Home Depot awhile said horrible hard work got paid.

In white collar world, I've seen low-paid technician kids get laid three weeks Christmas job offer rescinded guy gave two weeks notice current company. could 8 weeks full lock early on

You're complete fool believe this.  higher. don’t see anything FDA report aligns top comment reduced transmission. Curious see came get flu get flu vaccine.

Will Covid? agree, sucks use back line would still like avoid covid. Unless reach herd immunity next months, I'm going weirdo going anywhere everyone else back normal. think mistaken I'm coming from. 

I'm explaining, justifying. mention obviously tons people covid. someone covid allowed go stuff like this? month ago know can't give someone whats harm? 

Obviously everyone. ton people careless since beginning. It’s disheartening never thought society would responded way. guess optimist. covid thought people would think like what’s best one another. figured course someone would care others. It’s right thing do. Boy, wrong 😔
People today would never made WW2 Great Depression. Could imagine today’s society going rationing 30s?? makes worry future generations. Society entirely selfish.  could reviewed vaccine home 28 minutes WTBD Hopefully increase vaccine trust know reinfection happened I’m really sick people insisting it’s likely common. Like, sorry, realize it’s frustrating someone got partying hasn’t changed ways, they’re probably going catch COVID again. Don’t kink shame me. Probably waste. Good luck! sick getting sinus infections constantly, i’ve worn masks allergy season airline travel years now. difference masks heavier children longer get upset see me.  ;)

I see point flu, people get used almost anything incentive. hope people keep better hand washing hygiene. True long healthcare workers risk people taking we’ll fine imo sure Cause it’s two words? 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m answering question question rhetorical best. 

What’s point questioning anything? 

You’re implying accept everything face value. No, shouldn’t. 

We asking hard questions. tough pill swallow modern medicine isn’t always sure-fire solution. Research always change new information might revealed contradict previous studies.

Perhaps vaccine might prevent symptoms longer term effects. don’t know yet haven’t enough time observe it. 😂 reported numbers number doses, cut half number people immunized.

For entire US population, 700 million doses would needed, that's half combined 1.6 billion doses Pfizer (1B) Moderna (600M) estimate provide next 12 months. US buyer, enough signed contracts entire country. fauci liar, innate immunity? Keep mind always communicated ""December 29th *at latest*"" situation, media public opinion quickly turned ""on 29th"".

Presumably, 21st always internal goal, gave generous buffer case delays cropped up. Perhaps they're confident hitting goal. No. moment forced receive vaccine (which soon), destroying every mask own. Fauci absolutely piss kind language. never received vaccine told still act like disease. Sorry Great news.

I hope suppliers come fold make widely available 2021.

I see particularly effective businesses, especially airlines concert venues. use people’s apps effectively check people door policy - without need mandate vaccinations. Oxford two-dose, though One thing *may* found slight increase risk [Bell's literally 1 10,000 may random chance. shoes, personally would acknowledge chance suffering side effect lower chance dying covid, would thing pay attention next months. millions people get vaccine numbers drop 1 10,000 less that, hopefully means safe. winds really 1 10,000, maybe justified healthy young person skip vaccine (although still less dangerous actually getting covid, personally would probably still get it) Thank reporting post! way. 3-6 months nationwide numbers. depends many people vaccinated time. Boston marathon bombing. Snowden leaks. Zimmerman got acquitted. Lots can't recall. Yes. Wear mask jog cycle too. Seth Meyers said, don’t crop dust! counties reopen March lockdown. November, gyms open, dine restaurants allowed, gatherings people outside household allowed, schools open, etc. that’s huge difference lockdown March you’re either uninformed spreading misinformation/lies. Probably already got lol Yep, Georgia do

Not parents get naughty list failing socially distance, Santa gave children gift COVID holiday 5% population confirmed infection. 2% population current confirmed infection. come contact 34 people day 50% chance one active covid infection. Difference culture Wait, sub sure Moderna stock fraud scam never going make anything execs went jail. nope, actually remember are, can't important can't remember them. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Chirp Chirp.. significantly cheaper local Petland. Even 1/4 eaten critters. knew year would shite got food poisoning New Years bed ridden January 1st Curious many hours day wear for? yet Cardiologist advised go Pfizer one... told go Moderna. don’t know. Theoretical must refreh 3 month. family members still saying “it’s flu!” claim flu actually kills people. 

The CDC website says WORST flu season (2017/2018) killed 61,000 people entire year United States. It’s usually far less.

We’re already 5x that... counting.

I hate people. 6 9 days Excellent! logic, would vaccine long term effects flu vaccine doesn't? unsubstantiated fertility hasn’t evaluated throughout trials, whereas would normally necessity, emergency use authorization granted given pretense good vaccine general outweigh bad.

The complaint Pfizer filed Europe basis given spike protein used promote antibody response human analog processes related placental development, evaluated whether possible vaccines could prompt autoimmune response human analogue protein rendering women effectively infertile.

There’s evidence would case, however hasn’t tested ever. vaccines effects fertility assessed next couple years. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Can't even blame them. Dad gets vaccine going visit him. miss guy. Protect folks, 85% vaccination US \*never happen\* Still going Memorial Day first spree mask burning parties. Let's honest, likely 40M Americans contracted COVID end Q1, vaccinate focus healthcare workers elderly, pretty much eliminated majority threat April. leaves wondering kind forcing think people think going on. consider Asian countries wear masks time public, sociopathic? Really shows bad politician Trump is/was. easy win could've easily propelled power November also rallying cry decoupling China increasing self-sufficiency manufacturing. nope. agree. problem people think incorrectly vaccine end-all. ZERO info long protection lasts, ZERO info carrier transmissibility vaccinated. pretty much ZERO info anything reduces symptoms massive amount get it, prevents getting like 95%. every single metric unknown least year. never happen, would certainly earn points so. hope get one. odd, stay out. declining might give cover/strength ohers same. 

The pandemic never dangerous vaccines work we’ll get past this.  holiday many households differing notions safety worth risk. Santa: want Xmas?

Kid: toy truck!

Santa: bad! Here's corona! Happy Holidays! trust pharmaceutical companies

Holy shit dude. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Umm, fun socializing bar mask on... I'm especially dubious continued mask wearing reason enough people refused get vaccinated. hard keep asked make sacrifices compensate around unwilling to. Last living WW1 vet also woman, recall correctly. actually teared reading article. procreation absolutely *not* ultimate purpose every human. that’s kind boomer shit hear in-laws upset you’re giving grandchildren lmao also kind self-important shit hear moms want skip line disneyland “my kid sun he’s got sensitive skin” Can’t wait see parents. Healthcare worker can’t go near last year. Electric planes can't come fast enough. Normal setting washing machine. Jokes ton people live US never traveled abroad statistically never will. gonna happen, vaccine given at-risk people prevents vast majority deaths keeps hospitalizations easily manageable levels reason continue restrictions think rest society see way. Gathering empirical basis around NPIs crucially important, even seems self evident you. give march. point people refuse wear them. soon vaccinated rate reaches around 50% everyone say well thats enough stop restrictions. restrictions longer tolerated point. point tell got - vaccine placebo? likely vaccinated Based data - Oxford vaccine prevents 100% severe cases. saying efficacy among got *at least* 1 dose 92%. However, 99% people went also receive second dose.

The way present somewhat confusing, question looking Pfizer data. wear mask cleaning cat litter now, continue this! choice. could 8 weeks full lock early lasted year administration nothing, rather opposite helping. gonna be, quit fucking spreading shit done. really difficult logic.

If said people ""would take Covid vaccine?"" vaccine readout solid data, many people would said minds answering would take unapproved vaccine.

However, asking question data, approval scientific backing, question changes minds people. Instead asking would take approved drug.  Dude, wearing masks mean can't that. That's social distancing lockdowns. Going forward wearing masks stores public transit difficult thing anyone New normal idiots everywhere Non-non-asymptomatic Eric toner guy seriously kiss a$$ license formula produced company. Many pharma companies actually research licensing use 3rd party factories anyway production. get significant number less effective vaccines due solely licensing issues criminal. cholesterol up, it’s always low, incentivized change. think it’s also getting dressed regular clothes lol bc I’m telecommuting. need everyone vaccinated get back normal. bit Facebook argument good friend mine joined Army 20 something years ago. job NBC NCO (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological) means general he's charge protective masks tests exist presence chemical agents nutshell. somehow thought gave great knowledge infections disease experience Army somehow gave ridiculous opinions credence. hard keep friendship person talking obtuse. speak yourself. 2020 taught watch expectations closely. can't disappointed expected nothing, happily surprised things go well.

Some call pessimism. call realistic optimism. year sucked royal ass stop moving goal. moved apartment middle pandemic. Covid shove it. straight Macy's propaganda. Recommendation ok, mandating past summer absurd imo Even approve now, take everyone vaccinated. enough vaccination doses available. hope approve vaccine soon, virus still problem numerous months this. Especially younger healthy people risky jobs likely get vaccinated summer. might even wait 2022. Naw, you’re alright. fat finger time time. People love talk trash Amazon people continue order Prime Accounts. People love talk trash back changing behavior. since getting downvoted I'll ask. people wearing masks not? may affect young part, still carriers spreaders. assume people misinterpreting statement pro mask. Im hoping, people trigger happy agreeing OP. medical professional, I’ve already accepted fact wearing mask inside hospital rest career. There’s way hospitals reign back safe easy preventative measure. Yeah no. vaccines effective rollout successful deaths nearly zero already summer, people forget pandemic quickly. know Santa anti-masker, he's visiting local grocery stores Santa outfit without mask, laughing whole time can't anything it. kids sit lap pictures, wearing masks either. gives adults hugs, without masks. 

And adults love this, say he's best Santa ever, real Santa wear mask. They're not. precious. dead set year amazing! got new job. moved back CA FL. going go explore whole damn state find man process.

But December. adventure-less, man-less, wearing St Patrick's day shirt 3rd day row. Unfortunately, eugenics still pretty popular within medical community, also general. It’s fucking disgusting. 2020 really year, Captain Hindsight. wonder studies say drug worthless others say it’s great. studying drug?

How general public make sense this? Uhh 328/3 I'm donkey sandwich sorry bad lemme fix would even bother trying explain peer review work, going perform mental gymnastics. honestly got nothing mainstream whatever want call it, it’s go scientific bodies work, doesn’t make angry, makes sad science failing communicate it’s process schools failing educate people way understand ideas protected charlatans. Comrade  see already happening, people sub starting say start wearing masks every winter stop things like flu. Especially start areas really struggling, Alberta. still remember exactly sitting decades ago, short film shown class: painful minutes, watched woman talking mechanically, raspily hole throat, pausing occasionally gasp public service message: happen nightmares ad, today would likely tagged trigger warning deemed unsuitable children. supremely effective: never started smoking doubt horrified classmates either. don’t disagree dumb it’s business works. vaccines completely publicly funded maybe could refocus production effective ones, produced big pharma companies trying make money end day. also impossible know long term effects corona virus. 

You're betting corona virus protien vaccine helps create going dangerous virus itself. point likely reached next winter good That’s act home alcoholic dad beats belt.
But sit quietly play video games instead going class, doesn’t care. im gonna get shot right peehole Lockdown fatigue totally dependent live. northeast there's still ton places closed, many never reopen. Technically we're forced stay homes, basically there's literally place go. We've strict mask mandate since April. lower death rates country, can't help feeling nearly entire year life wasted make happen. Someone living Florida mask mandates places open probably feels lot different. hate them. want young Kids see faces people. Learn social cues that. I’m tired people like act like masks aren’t disruptive harmony normal socialization. Wait, actually enact prolonged quarantine lot people are? 

Where live people usually ordered quarantine infected contact someone infected (and test results in). quarantine would also usually last 2 - 3 weeks, healthy again, long. fundamental research vaccine development publicly funded. nothing give-away graft. gotten flu would rather get wear mask rest life. one forcing you, seriously think people truly misunderstanding this. No, talking wearing masks 24/7 wherever go forever. love new trend posting paper's code data Github. Look far we've reference 2018 census 20,498,753 people listed employed “Health Care Social Assistance”"
