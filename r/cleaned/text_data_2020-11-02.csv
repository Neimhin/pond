0,2020-11-02," Yes. Forget -- there's much astroturfing and/or braindead trash can't tell difference outdoors protest everyone masks (that create Covid spikes) hundreds indoors packed dance floor without masks. walling 3 weeks? Survivors let out. Give man Nobelprize FOLES!!! define lockdown depending wet restrictions make you? There’s barely states that’s trending upwards.


There’s unlimited supply Doctors Nurses.
Creating bed space hospitals alternative care sites easy staffing hard. ICU Nurses Doctors infinite supply.


A lot European Countries going lockdown yet cases growing faster still aren’t locking mask mandate. It’s gonna dark winter us. medical field science, like engineering: goal generate much experimental data possible, goal screw get people killed. absence information contrary, sensible assume respiratory illness airborne. old two? Fuck cunt, hypocrisy comment wild. ""how pathetic assume I'm American"", literally next line, ""must Aussie"". Incomprehensible. Economic collapse ftw guys. time alive.  RSVP address Well could pulled eu scale countries worked together... Chinese government *lot* super unethical, illegal shit ignores basic human rights.

But forced quarantines one things. contagious disease, regardless country, government legal right quarantine you. Korea too, we're ranked higher Democracy Index US. 

The US precedent past, legal via today's US laws, US could entire time functional government. Nice. Hope good party.  fair 75 Mph helmet going anything. 
If go speeds like over. It’s also mobile respiratory droplet collector. Especially you’re shorter person producing said respiratory droplets.... 3 require much evidence suggest respiratory illness might airborne. Medicine science experiment, professionals base plans prudence experience. think you’re right, believe we’ll able meet one person different household outside. Yes, BLM protests amidst pandemic bad idea.
The protests Covid measures even dumber.
Having huge party record high cases idiotic.

But reasoning shows really limit human capacity moron! least officially acknowledged lingering symptoms problem now. Hopefully fewer people suffering long-haul COVID keep getting dismissed doctors now. Iam sure new already posted.

There also ongoing discussion europe topic. Well that’s encouraging! isn’t protecting properly smh honestly pandemic started didnt even really know wore masks...i never thought much remember asking mom seeing many asians masks drove san francisco something, dont think really knew either...up pandemic started thought pollution general air quality something.

d'oh! point scale things worry about. self inflicted heart disease pressing..

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Austrian must say welcome, hear participation well. Maybe something owned well. country world small enough pull really would helpful get numbers painlessly! Good job CNN.  entire Trump administration needs charged crimes humanity treason. Obviously true. fact dissolve school systems high school. really comes to. would say vaccine widely available, end it. even matter whether disease gone, controlled, whatever. I'm sure it'll probably 6+ months point, another 6 months ""covid fatigue"" piled top everyone. many people even last another 6 months? clearly less less less go along. vaccine drops general population, thing over, one way another - ""medically"" ""socially"" believe scientifically referred to. 

Everyone waiting vaccine point, better worse. care well respected scientist authority - put coronavirus vaccine try update messaging ""it really fix anything, still live fucked way undefined period time"" literally one going listen point. Weakening Britain summed as-

Farage: Psst, hey, Cameron?

Cameron: What?

Farage: Wanna leave EU?

Cameron: I, er, um...

Farage: people love it; immigration go down.

Cameron: *nervous sweating shags pig's head*

Farage: Come on, man, dare you.

Cameron: Okay, sure. people Britain vote leave.

2016 Referendum: '52% vote favour leaving EU.'

Cameron: Oh, shit.

Farage: YES!

*David Cameron left chat* won't. struggle get wear even today. can't declare pandemic infects Pandem region France. then, sparkling outbreak. Wonder Pfizer AstraZeneca gets approved UK impact US vaccine approval speed process? &amp;#x200B;

what mono? fuck going there? population 5 million? almost many cases Canada - country 35 million... Interesting thats first heard Echinacea risk - im going look this, thanks! Viruses mutate constantly. That's different flu virus every year. spreading lethal disinformation dumb fucking shit. matters time people see end, really get there. vaccine know take X months vaccinate majority, life already feel normal. We’ll start booking trips planning parties weddings trips 6 12 months point feel like life somewhat “normal” again, despite life really changing yet. Lead water?

Fuck knows recent issue - ffs theres decent amount schools actually teaching creationism.....or trucks deliberately spew smoke environment....also things like elected prosecutors/law enforcement unchecked authority police.......lack critical thinking leading whole areas US intolerant racist also going rah rah america

Its like abundance squandering _can't _be controlled long people mixing new infections imported states/countries. major Western countries have. people, even small groups, start mixing inside slowly surely builds again. might better average age 19.4... Yup Trumps fault! made thousands liberal New Yorkers party hard observe social distancing!   Lmao well put takes one family members one mistake. Party Rock house tonight! Everybody urge die. trump wins, media frenzy continue. biden wins, they'll slowly back fearmongering come jan 20th, hear peep again. definitely political risk population still non-trivial enough healthcare support them.

If get overwhelmed risk population much larger without treatment, bad outcomes much much higher. point Einstein , obesity heart diseases contagious. 

Next time please pay attention what's going on. I'm sorry loss... may heart find peace comfort Wtf wishing better health actually attempting argue aren’t? Absolutely nothing /s Actually not. 
In simple layman terms contagious virus spreads easily kills less. 

A deadly variant spread easily host would die sooner hence restricting spread. 

Spanish flu different spread soldiers. 
In instance, soldiers deadly sick taken away war zone ferried back cities mildly sick soldiers sent fight. result dealt variant reached city centres hence th devastation. estimated there's ten times cases reported. math. No, ""all people do"". Hong Kong close 100% mask wearing, still experienced 3rd wave July. contain covid requires three-pronged approach: 
1) wide-spread easily available testing. 
2) enforced isolation +ve cases. 
3) enforce 2-week quarantine travelers abroad. 
4) mask wearing. 
5) effective contact tracing.

UK failed these. literally commenting ""source that"". Dr Fauci ever heard thing called immunity? long warm loving embrace communist authoritarianism Depends bad flu strain is. 9-15k flu deaths year US use metric use Covid, scale covid much worse. unfortunately, covid symptoms much worse flu terms severity length we’ve seen shut healthcare systems aren’t really comparable contagions terms impact society. But, yeah, flu year 250k dead, would certainly conversation. Learn population who’s average age 19.4? (World meter) gasp hours, supplemental O2, flu? (She refused intubation.)

You can. normal, happen. Israel invent this? good data here: Liberalism good. Socialism not. Staying home needs normalized, far schools workplaces routinely punishing people getting sick missing commitments. It’s fucking dystopian rager!!! may ask RN add vitamin routine checkup make sure tanked again. last test 8-10 years ago. probably won’t die  Europe seeing lockdowns again... Fauci confirmed vaccine ready go late December/early January.

They started final stage human trials back July. Fauci already confirmed first vaccines ready go late December/early January. Welcome Australia He's absolutely right though. Doctors describing EXTREMELY fringe minority. I've legitimately never met doctor spouts crazy shit hear doctors spout like news. doctor believes like demon sperm whatever probably doctor world thinks way. amount nurses I've met/have known spout ridiculous shit based instances hear others lead believe idiotic nurses necessarily fringe minority. nurse went high school called FB long ago mutual friends basically said calling addiction disease leftie bullshit. It’s gonna worse NYC. hit NYC, rest country able send help one spot help out.

Now there’s gonna thing happening. state able send help states hit hard, pressure, time mostly so. laugh true sad America could learn population who’s average age 19.4? 
Could learn people serious health conditions survive infancy? America returned west Africa. think Liberians pro science delusional. pathetic assume I'm American. 

Twatbuger lol love intellectual prowess posses, must Aussie. personally think effective way bring numbers without excessive shutdowns even cannot find people apply periodically infections jump certain threshold. isolate lot cases live goes rest, positive ones need stay home 10 days+ Probably believing energy minerals healing absurd concept thought crystal meth would work better. probably would. speak anyone id much prefer shave decade plus life kneecap quality. flattening curve doesnt much that

I'm cautious vaccine virus control, think statement alarmist? could possibly know enough point predict loss long-term life expectancy? It’s funny seeing people sub getting nervous thing wanted permanent, actually becoming permanent xD 

I wonder they’ll act find precious vaccine reduces symptoms doesn’t prevent infection xD I'm hoping includes triage questions as: attend rallies masks forbidden? wearing mask distancing? dining crowded restaurants, going bars, throwing and/or attending parties?

If answers yes, no, yes, vent you. GTFO. Meanwhile police welcoming fellow bigots smiles stroll packed Trump rallies thousands several serology tests summer around US world showed 6-7x case counts actual cases (with obvious issues long people test positive whatever testing criteria sample population obtained). 

No near complete population dramatically higher confirmed cases alone. Yeah, exactly. “Well obviously *drinkers* *drink socially* morons make bad decisions, everyone knows that.”

I can’t tell you’re 75 15. number correct that's 1 bed per 350 people, right 1 hospitalization every 500 people overall. we'd get approximately 9 million cases within span couple weeks fill literally every bed....but percentage beds normally occupied? many nurses quarantine? impact many cases per week would take fill every bed. Haha, fair enough. I've couple whiskeys, definitely dont want fearmonger.

Needless say, I'm going glued news next week information comes surrounding election pandemic. Crazy Queen like 120 years old still around Every shift think exposure receive horribly rude patients becoming, health insurance garbage even tho WORK healthcare, little im reimbursed im doing, think employer telling us dont enough money cleaning company anymore clean facility goes opens 3 offices, every shift think JAM PACKED patients

and every day think tiktoker instagram model making entire yearly salary one month filming themself falling floor holding milk.

I think every day. Every day question living. almost year since we've pandemic. fuck still enough PPE required materials doctors patients  US solved ton health problems past food fortification.

Yet USA one unhealthiest nation among Western nations. say masks cost anything wearer, everyone wearing one? call earlier?  I’m sorry. heart breaking  Exponential growth, shocking responsible thing always shit on. Tell where, anywhere says “don’t anyone ever.” 

It doesn’t. matter fact, state, gathering less 10 permitted. I’ll take advice pros mandate state fear mongering redditors. 

It’s illegal unacceptable gathering 10. Plus, one even asked outdoors. bad takes. expectation COVID19. going eradicated disease originates bats. Meh, nothing happens people thus shit continue. saying random words now? can’t even form complete sentences? We're objectively shit 

You entire logic opening worms.

Let's saying countries better, much better.

You would still shitting countries worse. judging competition. top 10 worse cases ""objectively shit"".

You reference point much enough. exist. I'm Mexico EVERYBODY contributing. need masks everywhere go. no, fuck us, we're shit... OBJECTIVELY.. lol Well, literally nothing else do, don’t blame you.  good night, fellow Redditor. can’t defend shit mate don’t even try thank god police limited amount space left internet

if reading subreddit often enough notice reposts problem amount time spending reading expectations, reposts, *especially* vital information everyone know I'd kick house. 

How grow spine stop enabler shitty decisions made stupid people?? 

Over 200k ppl died bc behavior like this, still defending them. cuz weak ppl like you. Sure, point.

Shouldn't fact supporting evidence enough dismiss claim? least enough remain skeptical categorize claim ""highly unlikely, requires citation"".  Given correlation places without masks, seems likely helped significantly.

But also seems clear places mask mandates good usage aren’t free continued issues. 

Thus “if people wore mask” remark presumably quite literal: mask time around anyone around anyone else last weeks social distance way. might enough would almost certainly also stay way long time. read instead skimming shiny pictures answer there. mean expecting relief high risk child start kindergarten normally next year... don’t think case since many people refuse get anyway. One challenges we've observed staff nervous using rapid test machines. Normally, check glucose, intimidated. I've seen facilities give rapid test machines reason.  Bars packed af saw sc stories best break up, gotta fun somehow wonder cause shift away cities. rural areas deserts far medical care middle sized towns think ones surplus medical space per person. even fraction people move places like LA, chicago, nyc small towns cause huge shift electorate, culturally, probably ways too. Kinky~ Hey, whatever choices make own. also living consequences... Oh remember now. Lots leaders showing us rules ""for thee me"" think see localized, like El Paso. sucks. Stay safe friend asking wrong person. idk shit im also asking questions. got hostile shit, pm threats non informative crap. people offended reason. Yet Biden worse orange /s [whispers]... ^(to paaaar-tayyy...) shouldn’t friends over, that’s rule. get tested beforehand that’s way it’s safe. said, don’t expect anyone follow 100% time. I’ve friends twice since pandemic, often since parents immunocompromised. social interaction definitely drive man crazy, understand friends every often even pandemic. Thank you. Unfortunately, business ""essential,"" think there's much do. considered started supporting masks scientific consensus masks beneficial? start year, something like one study efficacy masks used manner, cloth masks, virus influenza, fairly low compliance, scenario could essentially consider participants akin household community. things would impact results.

There *so many* studies ridiculous. Science learning. We've learning. We're still learning. Sometimes learning means need change belief there. CDC convinced faced growing evidence. Something tells issues Danish study throw doubt conclusion, without discussing able publish it, know. Average person knows 600 people, 550 thousand.  I'm wit's end seeing ICUs fill Covid patients.  Trick treat supposed cancelled area, many people complained said gonna anyway decided it. sucks big time. explained reason wanna still people taking things seriously. miss something? thought using tavern league others sue convene still shut attempt. probably got medical treatments UK people never receive. type person would thing? bad one

Ignorant dumb assholes People aren’t fooled media want live lives deaths per million 17th world. Hardly success thank service “It, again” brainwash people

It's fucking brainwashing share basic public health advice mean places facing choices following thr mandate going business ignoring mandate maybe staying afloat maybe getting fined going business. Idk choice would envy make it. certainly blame either choices.  mean papers referenced confirm saying, first one looking samples serious Covid patients course going see poor immune response associated worse disease. second one says memory B cells important factor immunity virus. Like jfc dude stop it’s pretty clear aren’t actual PhD won’t provide evidence is, party hosts get manslaughter charges. Cmon, everyone knows covid kill people now. used God country family Party everything Yes. mean yeah course, France worse I'm denying that, saying comparing overall testing/cases/deaths misleading useless. blame US testing enough start go ends lower countries even overall tests done. 71,000 Worldometer, 5 states (including Michigan) report. Yeah, ain't happening chief. soon vaccine anyway effective coursing veins, I'll throwing masks away. media allowed present China, yeah, verify that.

Lol  also pretty dehumanizing. family friend died nursing home spent last 8 months miserable alone family friends weren’t allowed visit her. don’t know solution it’s disturbing we’re continuing view “vulnerable” people don’t mental health needs rest us. apologies. Shame state then. guy, honestly, lunatic Yolo dude know die gonna enjoy last point- that's gonna happen election lol 8.76 million people UK 70 (15.21%). Ideally forever. Citation please Wow that's insanely low. Illinois 60,000 70,000 tests every day Murdoch losing power. Even ""Labor sucks"" scare campaign QLD, gained seats :) even go parties middle surging pandemic? worry stuck back head? KNOW taking big dumb risk here, way go somewhere hours pretend okay fine dandy nagging dread head. 

It must take real sociopath able silence inner voice trying tell making bad choice. Sadly, there's many sociopaths there... hard chill find 10 months leaders done anything Yes, work, school open, feel free go spread.

But whoever work home. Literally people prison “old enough live consequences actions.” Lock em throw away key, chance. forget guys, government's fault coronavirus bad U.S. - idiot people! Waiting source. Well data can't rushed, like discovering longterm effects. words, success earlier going screw us now.

Please understand differences April November. may see mass graves take seriously. bit traveling third world countries moron. crazily bold lie. Ok Beastie Boys lyric Ugh... hate seeing home town news Reddit. I've really disappointed Utah County last months. Happy Cake Day  Slovakia mass testing weekend around/below 1% infected according it. I'm pretty confident gyms spread virus (provided masks enforced). Anyone saying simply enemy fitness lol You’re probably right FDA requires least 50% efficacy Covid19 vaccines: don’t know (not snarky, don’t know science behind it). hope becomes normal wear mask you’re sick about. Americans appear much self-loathing loath accept behavior fellow Americans (including leaders) midst pandemic. kind brought ugly people, seems reasonable feel loathing that. 

""...Europe *had gotten* Covid control""...that's pluperfect, indicating action began ended past, prior past events. think that's pretty accurate. mean definitely wearing masks, technically. wish could ration care based people wear masks I’m you. irresponsible early 20’s know would parties COVID. Don’t let perfect people /r/coronavirus get down. often come learn ways could taking pandemic seriously. 

Not don’t wear masks distance, lot folks literally left house since March. Triggered think there’s couple issues probably more. First, lockdowns reduce transmission virus, costly, eradicate virus, merely slow temporarily. So, people watching places “locked down” longer harshly US resurgence cases higher original wave(s) economic societal consequences extended lockdown (examples include Europe).

For masks, live midwestern state mask mandate, good compliance far tell unlike neighbors, cases still accelerating. 

In words, want people comply mask mandate need minimum tell people masks effective procure them. example, airlines prohibit masks valves. mean ban masks valves? materials used? 

And materials don’t anything actually worse mask providing false sense security. 

People scream “anti-science,” reality government providing studies measures want implement openly discuss pros cons decision.

The problem lot political discourse shallow. Like yes lockdowns work also costs can’t done forever. Yes ramp testing, able test hundreds thousands day nationally. Sure wear masks masks work ones bullshit.

Both politicians throw blanket bullshit statements claim moral superiority. fully support that. gave N95 hospital.  I'm gonna try get another one wear mask (when I'm around people).

I buy whole immune thing. hope true I'm gonna bet it. apologize sounded harsh. worded better. What? saying prolonged isolation, living fear, getting exercise, eating poorly consuming alcohol excess bad health? Health means absence COVID-19 expense aspects life. must kind idiot Trumper. /S  Fuck police Lord I'm comin home Yeah, interesting Slovakia's current outbreak much smaller terms deaths per capita. Wonder true size Belgium's outbreak is, 30% positivity rate despite great testing. Imagine right-half gaussian curve x axis viral load frequency. Let's assume cases symptomatic viral load greater σ-2. Imagine vaccine reduces average viral load one standard deviation. less people zero viral load original value σ-2 vaccine vaccine. Thus fewer asymptomatic people before. fatigue, cognitive issues memory lapses, digestive problems, erratic heart rates, headaches, dizziness, fluctuating blood pressure, even hair loss.

I've experienced last two point past six months. fact, thought going crazy memory issues, questions. must asymptomatic carrier back spring going anti-mask face. things bad NY volunteers come states. Hopefully calls help go needed states. 2 years buddy, maybe never think mistaken prison system. Canines rare form punishment, restricted severe cases rape. punishments fines jail time.

Also, focus rehabilitation employment/economic opportunities ex-convicts. would rather productive members society reoffend create negative externalities society. pretty interesting! Thank links! Cringe kind agree, couple thoughts. Many workplaces still open, cause community spread. Even go back essential workers only, many companies declare “essential”. honestly, lot legitimately essential jobs many people think. They’re immediately apparent, downstream second order speak. Also, huge problem even gatherings small, people gathering 5-6 people time. 5 people gathering go separate gatherings following weekend, see community spread still occur even without mass gatherings bars/restaurants. I’m expert means, thoughts. still trying stay relevant? Jesus fucking Christ. Inheritance early. /s planning taking vaccine, meantime, forget healthy living: proper nutrition, daily exercise good hygiene practices. talked enough Yes, withholding medical care form punishment, matter for, terrible precedent set. It’s simply inhumane appropriate response government. American **idiots** telling us Covid fake.  understand irony want troll. whole state like snowmobile lanes specified routes, even little stops signs town town. yes, rent snowmobiles. 😘😘😘 long would willing selfless hero? 5 years? 15? amount time head you’d kindly ask may live left life?

There guarantee vaccine certainly silver bullet type one eradicates planet. New politicians business leaders. Give kid break somehow. go many months, needs get play friends.

We 6 year old. tried minimize risk wherever possible, get healthy possible (but also at-risk family members living us), let son play kids. obvious risk, seeing stand window state lock-down April, watching kids play (whose families flaunted rules) killed me. still follow rules executive orders, 90% leeway allow ourselves, use him. comprehend cascading effects. Like all. 

They conditioned understand ""one problem, one solution"", exists vacuum effect anything aside specific thing resolved. 

It's complex issues never get fully addressed. solution can't fit single sentence fixes everything without negative consequences (impossible) instantly rejected conceded unsolvable room improvement.

Otherwise, might admit know everything probably authority something feel strongly despite barely understanding subject matter. 100% agree. late roommate went hospice right hit. passed July GLAD able keep home til end. talk moving somewhere nursing care pre-COVID, done would alone last months. Instead able home taking above-average precautions, still reasonable seeing kids etc. elderly church dropping like flies pandemic, dying COVID, dying unstimulated depressed. also getting see loved ones keep eye health advocate them. flip side, caretaker young adult special needs. Socialization opportunities opening him. Locking away keep safe statistically hurting COVID would. They're following rules. be. Regardless, like saying holding knife someone level breaking rules mass murder. Yes can, buy-in states. Unfortunately many people US believe bollocks said man possessing modicum confidence, message going hard unite behind.

Australia showed internal borders controlled, even heavily populated states. ever going get past virus people use common sense avoid spreading it? protests means correcting wrong? would call gatherings result protests per se? Ok bud. least worry catching plague Tinder seems like girls already socially distancing you. Hopefully missed like got spiral deep dark place. Canadian here. penalties look scary paper, quarantine almost entirely unenforced. Good taking seriously. need understand lot people miss seeing smiles laughter funny expressions. I’d respect enough, trying warn you. I’ve disability, it’s easy miss plenty stuff. Take care.  feel like vast majority young adults equate risk dying covid possibility getting car accident. risk one thinks ever gunna happen majority us experienced far seems true. 

100k cases usa 1 day cases people asymptomatic mild symptoms. People still dying every day, wont stop theres vaccine. lockdown months people still dying. 

No one knows do, cant shut country anymore. dont like seeing people lose jobs, lose businesses dont like see people die. ive seen lot businesses struggle shut due first lock down. Thats like frequent local restuarants help support them. im fortunate enough largely uneffected pandemic. depends mask have. N95s P100s pretty damn good filtering tiny particles. purchasable amazon, even now. virus mutated extremely survivable version yet? Scott Atlas never changed message. /s Soros must bone dry liberal communist propoganda interest groups funds. Yea crazy. could've forgot scratched eye grocery store walking someone infected aisle long n95 protecting others well. time bust full gas mask go anywhere. Fuck anyone looking sideways Sometimes, something worse nothing. Europe decimated economy virus worse ever. countries seem control open keep citizens lock key keep numbers down. low-density island nations closed travel. isn’t option country like America. again; dozens western countries boat US, except they’ve taken rights citizens, destroyed businesses, created debt poverty, don’t heck lot show it. I'm also moron

Considering still demonstrate basic knowledge causes COVID infections, overestimated yourself.

Stop implying tests cause infections. genuinely thought ""this flu"" argument dead. 220,000 people dead america alone. total deaths causes gone up, they're nearly extensive damage covid done. Quarantines work. Look New Zealand. Look Thailand. Look Australia. work first month 2 lacked testing infrastructure generally population willing comply. testing, waiting population. admit picture pretty entertaining. longer look strange becomes. Yes, understand reducing symptoms reduces spread know many people spreading symptoms. Anyone? VACCINE Check [this CDC's recent estimate 9% US population infected immune, nowhere near 70% needed herd immunity. 

Also interesting read even vaccine might able quickly reach herd immunity, vaccines airway viruses 100% effective, significant portion population may refuse it. totally agree. 

That point. still think everyone wear masks etc... people know... like wildfire, quick judge. 

I agree people definitely bigger targets others... we're risk. would wear anything less N95 want avoid viruses? also, friends would respect way did. Ok kiddo. I’ll let last word. Say whatever makes feel superior “winning”, last reply. I’m right you. part right thing. feel like know like young. 

lol, think put suspended animation start puberty middle age? did. 71 new free testing sites going week. America fine gets paid people infect, form hospital bills. Veterinary clinics still getting o2 I’m assuming supply fine. mean, depends indoor outdoor. always outdoor, going indoor, hang near windows fans open. 

If willy-nilly inviting 8 friends enclosed apartment, yes, part problem. find peace whatever making aggressive.

A+ backpedaling 100% wrong literally every assumption made, love see it. drink tomorrow, Monday all

My username paraphrasing line WWI “support troops” poster. third fourth time salty commenter gone mic drop throwing “oh yeah? Well you’re alcoholic lolololol” line it. Funny every time. think there's nothing wrong wrong, especially comes politics. 

You generous person, statement helped bit generous myself. Thanks perspective. Yeah seems common trend. Open air reduces risk transmission absolutely massive amount, still feels weird many people without masks. Well, plain stick technically comparable gold standard. former nothing latter detects COVID. See, compared them. There’s power scaring people.  Sure... maybe.  family I'm wife son (who almost never leave house, 7 months). mom taking care 94 year old grandmother. 

They order groceries.  still shop ours... grocery store candidate... really is. thank you! That's max, average closer 5-6 days. 

Regardless, young people 99% parties, likely huge impact case count simply rarely get sick. 

The issue young people infect. really, spikes might start happen 2-3 weeks after. got vaccinated. mean could go bar hopping manhattan brooklyn, want really fun gonna want kind established social circle new york meet people parties. kind weird showing stuff knowing anybody. Especially participants self-selected taking fewer precautions recommended.

I think lot. 

Even wanted particular activity reasonably elevated (but terrible) risk profile... think could bring simply I'd know majority people like ""yeah cool, I'm going go that!"" would kind people taking seriously saying ""yeah cool, I'm going go that!"" along. Right protests sturgis spikes, sorry there's queue. Wearing mask-based costume party rookie mistake. drink keg beer?   Get news outside reddit Holy fuck Agreed.  think wearing get less ""viral load"" though IMO. 

I'm still disappointed half country making N95 masks.  seems like no-brainer... way cheaper things they're Ok one vacationing right sure castles matter.

The correct answer one, mate. Right. people like that. 

But party, would assume everybody party like that? NYC places people tend party lot? Feel bad loved 1s get sick Yeah hopefully. meantime worked script get people wearing masks properly. Eg picking food one dick nose types, ask mind wearing mask properly. usually act surprised, oh okay! follow saying, “I’m worried COVID (goal: make feel like relate), tested positive trying spread many people (sucker punch).” ask even COVID, I’ll say something like “Oh it’s mild case, Trump said it’s like flu recovered fine I’m worried”. Feel free adopt you’re also asshole. easily adopt outside situations, struggling pull mask maskless person approaches. old guy Oregon tell me, it’s okay, I’m worried COVID! responded, oh okay good cause tested positive. Gave sly smile walked away even knew react. Yeah, too... yeah agreed. maybe mentioned enough hit northeast hard people got extra money, economy struggling eight months already there’s zero help people contrary, think expectations quite low. fact, know many people believe FDA integrity left 4 years orange one. hard read. I’m senior school worked hard bring cases spike weeks classes. 

I know one girl party right now. Everyone else know upset didn’t get chance fun Halloween year say even party beginning semester. obviously don’t know everyone, really thought behaving responsibly small percentage students throw progress away hurts.  Uhh, pandemic? Anybody gathering like gives shit know US handles protections traveled car across country back. absolutely horrific. people everywhere trying undermine system. people genuinely care health health others, one them. people follow rules rules rules follow rules. people follow rules forced too. people rebel force. 

Here US get away it. pretty liberal governor. Shut state try get control situation. rural areas, signs everywhere pro Trump next Pritzker sucks signs. 

Locals obey rules point required too. Since community professionals, tend civil dont cause much fuss required wear mask. local health official actually said things like "" evidence higher chance catch covid restaurants bars businesses."" ( Since dont wear mask eating drinking tend people talking loudly due heavy background noise, SIGNIFICANTLY higher locations) "" shut restaurants bars, might lower daily case count 1 ( 5%)""

He goes talk statistics numbers new cases such. completely contradicts says "" dont know new cases coming from.""( bars restaurants apparently!) "" doesnt surprise rise cases, people moving indoors bars restaurants cool weather"" interview local paper. 

He KNOWS lying people people like US disaster right now. People like encourage people obey rules. fact several local bars refused close indoor dining despite governors threat pulling liquor license. small businesses. Even 

Walmart known looking way. employees wont stop entering without mask even though required. important dont upset antimaskers keep customers employees safe. Sam Walton clawing grave deeper deeper embarrassment stores become. 

In England different. wife English. talk side family weekly. reason parts open arent England actually quite active keeping control virus. England 10 times population density US. twice population density New York State 4 times dense California. sprawling cities US, whereas built up. 

First different zones( zones state well) zone restrictions based  cases. restrictions enforced. fined heavily violations zero tolerance policy. fines range hundred pounds thousands pounds multiple offenses. 

If allowed go out, social distancing/masks/etc. request, law. Businesses licenses pulled enforcing requirements business do. One biggest differences NHS ( National Health Service) phone. tap check public buildings visit. also warns someone tested positive last 10 days, think, within X take measures protect yourself. 

They also much bigger isolation bubble enforce it. get caught mingling people outside bubble( check) fines. dont really anti maskers people pretending like illness exempts them( brother nearly oxygen COPD wears mask leaves house). Whole different culture there. 

My hope US able leave house feel safe going vaccine politicians care money power people come distant 50th. They're basically massive warehouse raves. Common brooklyn. Probably damn Floridians Texans abiding. Good New Yorkers wouldn’t thing aggressive towards strangers? poor relationship alcohol past mean everyone else lacks impulse control did. saw advice Halloween masks count wear regular mask one going anywhere. makes sense since costume masks mouth nose openings loose fitting anyways.

Not costumes masks. ""I mean need 10-15 mins unmasked space someone it.""

Its bit scarier even that. virus airborne, means one person (and esp superspreader) enclosed indoor space hours air filled enough virus infect everybody room. Even person leaves, virus remain air. 

Of course, highly varies. people actually exhale enough virus infect many people. super spreaders able that, guy south korean nightclub infected 200+ people single night. protest? looting robbing people? would OK.  Absolutely - sign accepts need change strategy pivot Asia Pacific model.

Literally week ago adamant lockdown terrible idea. He's forced 11th hour advisers basically said going need security guards blocking entrance hospitals bodies going start piling temporary morgues.

He learnt anything. We'll come lockdown numbers ease bit we'll go straight back pot boil again. we'll live winter. They're simply called Tin Foil Hat Brigade wonder they're still conducting online research vague sewers rando country handke groceries one leave store? article needs give feeling whether good bad number. probably never gonna reach 0. However, 2 x 1,000 seems like much city size NYC. Covid Zombies.. Soon = Tuesday Whats difference ""friends"" ""quarantine friend""? individual take extra precautions leave house? can't ban idea. enjoy basement dweller good luck lol. Thanks responding. brought interesting point. Jaclyn Baker, 32, died first June drug overdose Palm Beach County. Overdose deaths year. deaths diseases like diabetes Alzheimer’s external causes like car accidents. 

The author trying pull heartstrings get think EVERY death year attributed COVID that's true.

Not not. looked little bit better US A, god damn low bar. 113 deaths average 23/10 till 29/10... feel like idiot atm? pandemic fatigue dude. time goes people whole getting tired isolated. I'm personally still mostly isolated know ppl quarantine circles like 20 people. Human beings social creatures legitimately hard mental health remain isolated. I'm saying right wrong I'm giving reason. realize governments infinite money, right? government programs gonna dry sooner (in poor countries) later (in rich countries). Happy cake day!

Also cant blame scientist job. advicing based current avaliable information, Johnson talk many scientist make decisions suitable approach country. Sweden obviously took account negative aspects blanket lockdowns, talking probably smart. underlying unemployment rates gone up, yes. many developed countries least think big government programs keep people employed simply allowing paid leaves. E.g. almost everyone know working 30% larg part year, getting 90% pay, gap paid gov't. sure Germany though. source specifically says 15 days would enough get us way through. Thanks. Feel bad Brits. It’s gonna go away. gonna stay home forever?

One lot really really dumb selfish people there. think people forget empty US populated Europe. 

France 117 inhabitant per km\^2 US 17 states (including DC, Virgin island etc...) reach threshold. Tons place US need lockdown order people keeping distance. France even someone living rural region decent sized city (let's say 30 000 persons) within 30 minutes drive, likely major city (Airport, University, public transit system) within 2h drive. 

So basically virus spread faster populated area empty places Waaaahhh Obviously right. think that, see everyone campus using correctly well train bus take get there, correct mask use pretty high.  level retardation beggars belief. one reason trying herd immunity wrong top fact work without vaccine making unethical.

it break healthcare system supplies capacity mental physical health healthcare workers.

these people can't hire new ones street. takes years training experienced &amp; skillful job. mental emotional capacity ER work. Wear out, give PTS PTSD sicken covid possible long term effects deaths break healthcare system years. exactly want done them? 

Do want government force quarantine people? mean, might well install gestapo point. That's lot fines jail time I'm sure!

It's like we're turning blind eye dead temporary convenience something.

It's definitely like mentality real plague vaccine anything...

For now, cost lives. lead first wave decrease way less quickly similar countries, total deaths higher. However, strategy may start pay right now, second wave. still long run bet: cumulatively, still 5x times death per person Germany Dozens? Try hundreds Duh, yeah. Minimum six weeks get benefit also need set expectations. People mistaken belief ""normal"" returns schedule set government, virulent virus. People careful lockdown one setting next lockdown. Forget opening bars restaurants gyms things got people lockdown first place.

Could please stop fear mongering? Yeah, fit tested N95 works better one worn casually. *But completely irrelevant*. choice people N95 random piece cloth. bet N95 works lot better there, since least chance fitting properly, masks huge gaps default. waste money it.

N95 crazy expensive hard find long people assume N95 enough, confident still risk infection. 

That claim repeated since start pandemic, yet see evidence it. [a study showing Please look Egypt’s COVID “response” look numbers. Combined no-deal Brexit: yes. Bad choices consequences. Fixed ya!

*The Media report* city hospitals overrun patients H1N1 outbreak.

That's issue 2009 Pandemic, downplayed media really problem. Hopefully plundering oceans last blue fins multiple factors here. Probably biggest three are:

1) Germany, seeing happened Italy, reacted soon shit hit fan.

2) Germany running much slower year usually would, deaths accidents way lower used be.

3) German health care best world, heck even best Europe, still quite high level. need help, get help, questions asked. virtually people without health insurance co-pay US it. risk debt, people postpone doctors/hospital visits late.

But important thing graph this: number excess death reported Covid deaths almost same, means data published accurate representation reality (unlike, e.g., US 30% gap) hate headline news everywhere U.K. morning. Agree. It’s much better living low probability spread returning. day without new case like giant sigh relief. Yes bracing day start giving vaccine US. Many people consider pandemic “ over” second nurse puts bandaid injection site start demanding full reopening stop taking precautions. body cared Sweden new cases deaths weeks row.... know why? make ""sacrifices"" conditioned think acceptable illusion ""safety"".

Melbourne spike again, virus. Unless prepared live captivity indefinitely. coronavirus related? We're still middle current pandemic. fix one focusing next one. run hospital equipment, staff drugs fully care fro people... That's archaic level care. would normally insert snarky comment here.

Yes going unspeakably painful we'll prop airlines long time, option. We've tried rule 6, limits indoor dining, 'soft' quarantine etc etc. enough, work. look rest Europe. 

We've got stomach American 'let bodies simply pile up' approach either sit permanent state lockdown. real world game. travel bans ever worked contain virus? Covid might kill 3 million pessimistic scenario.

Thanks links, assumed positive symptoms started told everyone bubble immediately. People told stay homes can't visit others... lockdown think virus arrived US caravan? lot help... virus spread. would almost rather nothing. Like Australia mean?

The reason can't US society failing there. Perhaps would *never* leave red zone.

What personal freedoms? Stay away bars months? Hardly heavy imposition. virus eradicated, things go back normal - like NZ. rather NZ right now? Everywhere could like NZ! It’s classist, one much much higher commitment time studying learning even get continue. can't eliminate virus. slow spread.

Let rephrase way. 

Historically, vast majority epidemics pandemics typically highest mortality young old. words, mortality curve looked like U.

Thankfully, case, young, reasons unknown, spared.

And even fortunately, mortality curve follow curve 1917 Spanish flu pandemic, looked like upside U, maximum mortality 18-35 age range. particularly nasty pandemic (and keep mind life expectancy time something like 60 years).

...that issue, uncle Sam. liberty personally angry them, nonetheless, sub, ask refrain attacking users. Wait, didn’t say lockdowns bad telling people end them? Smh. Always sort controversial real comments. bad early phase infection. takes days virus replicate enough might picked swab, get tested day infection, odds false negative 100%. test day symptom onset, falls 38%. wait 3 days symptom onset, falls 20%. accurate test get, grows less reliable again.

The odds false positive 1% according software engineer, trust algorithm think gonna deployed anywhere. fun project thing missing title AI. Humans innately social creatures, need call anyone pathetic. time yeah people pay pay point police evicting. Poor people? continue get government welfare. working classes issue.  Holy fuck, can’t believe it’s whole year since whole thing started. Also failure US government  Depends. work restaurant it’s mixed bag. owners take every precaution super serious. Others barely blink positive test keep restaurant running. seems work larger company offering sort assistance time work essential workers small businesses little options miss work won’t compensation you’re gone. bad, virus made 10x less dangerous vaccine I’m taking precautions longer. know paint scenario every country world resources ”heavy contact tracing” work home half year.

This would doom world’s poor countries eternal isolation. virus would still remain there, making large outbreaks regular occurence rest world. 

And even if, divine intervention, got worldwide cases 0, virus could jump animal again, we’re back. 

Even best case scenario, world would need maintain aggressive contact tracing local lockdowns very, long time, making pandemic never ending. 4 people sue school board. Let's make news article post r/coronavirus 

One thing I've learned pandemic reddit absolutely loves clickbait rageporn media. is! found him! done full lockdown 4-6 weeks spring US would much better now

Europe thing look now. scientific article referring to? come across one, ever. Copy paste another One tests they've used (SD Biosensor Standard Q) claims 99.68% specificity actual paper, include fair number people cough COVID testing data, algorithm handle particularly worse groups working job year US eligible FMLA leave. can't fire you. UNPAID. cool job waiting you, meanwhile can't make rent eat.

Plus, requires current employer full year. guess. Unfortunately due huge gap it’s unlikely we, nation, could get everyone wear mask. words best bet would hope speedy natural waning virus. People tired trying stay alive

You realize that’s actual thing right? That’s complex PTSD comes from. human brain beautiful adaptable thing enables survive sorts crazy environments, left stressful environment (especially one involving life/death risks) long allows normalize environment prioritize automate neural pathways related stress. 

Dopamine production drops, along oxytocin. Cortisol increases, adrenal sensitivity drops. brain literally stops able give fuck puts giving fuck autopilot.

Honestly year feels lot like traumatic experience. fear, brain fog, knowing comes next worry more. Maybe not. places leaving patio open claiming that’s like outdoors. We’re screwed. nasty, insulting, arrogant piece trash.

Good bye. trust me, wish flirting 100k tests day 20k tests day 

--sconnie doesn't, probably 100% would self-reported asymptomatic anyway. symptoms supposed go, get proper PCR test. he's working sweating bad, probably not. think you’re suffering many freedoms completely free go move one authoritarian countries clearly think much better longer suffer burden freedom, sweetie.    True countries dealt serious outbreak before, common attitude ""we know better, everyone else idiots that's struggled"" priorities continued running business minimising deaths infections.

Once finally realised healthcare system whole brink catastrophic shutdown, (and might even affect personally?) *then* ""nobody whole wide world could've seen coming! :O"". they've realised actually healthcare system bit resilient everyone scared families lives, fuck it, we'll shutdown little possible absolutely to. disabled person actually likely ill either die serious complications, thanks. work myself, things pretty good there. work next park always full people. 

I know back normal, seems pretty good.

Maybe make plans hang park friends?

I understand might rural car, would suck. true. algorithm trained forced/voluntary coughs rather involuntary coughs. algorithm 100% accuracy labeling asymptomatic individuaks COVID (think like 180 people group iirc) 

It like 94% rate labelling negative participants negative. days ago drop 6 months, gone 3 years coronaviruses including SARS1 severe infections. Reinfection possible people one year, coronaviruses, per prior vaccine research 70s.

Basically pretty likely people getting covid once, every year. heart lung damage accumulating, possible ADE. chance death go.

BTW one week ago people claiming permanent immunity, sterilizing vaccines. keep pretending optimists right anything. Frogs boiled, making fun everyone else getting warm water. tests, achieved 98.5% success rate among people received official positive coronavirus test result, rising 100% symptoms.  researchers would need regulatory approval develop expert Calum Chace described algorithm ""a classic piece principle feeding machine lot X-rays learns detect cancer,"" said. problem symptoms mostly eliminated? Won’t drive deaths significantly? Spell logic here. would total population matter? US countries sub-10 million populations apples oranges - especially European countries border controls, making much comparable US states. much better question US match EU (447 million population) Europe (741 million). confirm. Poor. Homeless. Ready die. wanted add lot people /r/gerd reported getting GERD Shortness breath since March including me.

Some tested positive others like suspected tests available. would usually say maybe it’s coincidence literally many new cases reported started March everyone shortness breath seems started March. 

I hear lot people tested positive appear stomach bowel issues including GERD acid reflux.

Very suspicious GERD common long term effect coronavirus type GERD called LPR silent reflux known cause shortness breath sinus issues.

Sadly GERD LPR lot side effects especially cold like symptoms breathing issues loss smell taste cause mucus etc. suspicion LPR GERD maybe long term side effect coronavirus way prove it. 

My sister also developed testing positive strong inhaler. stopped referring pro-life couple years ago sheer hypocrisy. They're forced-birth, means punishing women ""promiscuous"", controlling them. Campania lockdown? someone tell regulations when? surprise me. Back September train Prievidza, region hit waves. nessage asking passengers cover nose mouth, conductor walking around train checking everyone's ticket mask chin. One tests they've used (SD Biosensor Standard Q) claims 99.68%. that's based one false negative (as compared PCR). think I've seen higher numbers listed elsewhere. goal wasn’t eradicate virus prevent 100% infections deaths, make sure hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. Unfortunately, United States, federal leadership constantly undermined directly contradicted messaging promoted idea pandemic control measures unpatriotic. Thus, end sizeable minority feels responsibility runs counter public health officials advising. guy said california rations water little fish pacific ocean miss quote Kipling ""If keep head around arn't"" understand severity situation. No, should. Court dismissed. spite of, rather of, large scale testing program. Mass testing containing spread, failure. Masks prevent spread. It’s proven many settings. 

I agree social distancing good. 

We different masks now. link article? clean change masks. idea then. vidence bacterial pneumonia caused masks.

I agree masks shouldn’t create false sense security. That’s terrible reason advocate wearing masks. Milwaukee Rep, Pabst Theatre, Skylight Music Theatre. Supposedly Chamber working something committed publically. I'd say 50% problem. 50% people observing ""Social Distance, wear mask, wash hands, touch nothing"", rule. think atlantic provinces different reality though, barely population density. Essentials workers likely going work coronavirus. Poor healthcare whatnot actions seem little extreme considering ex-friend needs negative COVID test enter Hawaii without 14-day quarantine. Plus probably thousands people opted pay PCR test. shouldn't. right? classic bargaining stage.you could still see ops point...the china part made lose credibility

as see maybe already have, daily post become hivemind people convincing themseves cant stand anymore holidays problem Dude mean got whole argument bc implied reinfection real risk reality it’s tiny tiny one Utah already middle second spike. Middle upper class petulant children causing this, poor essential workers without choice.


This abject calamitous failure giving relief feds, full stop. really. Immunity drops starting 6 months, undetectable 3 years SARS1. keeping coronaviruses.

Vaccine challenge experiments coronaviruses 70s found people could reinfected one year identical strain, people milder symptoms. ADE definitely possibility, 90% may end weaker secondary infection, 10% may sick, made ratio.

So keeping prior research, essentially. doctors people know pandemics knew right away long would be.

I’m calling shenanigans still see experts saying back normal sometime late spring/early summer 2021 and... never. Yeah due really give people appropriate out. 

We supposed go hawaii last april.. Obviously happen, airline credited us give us refund credit expires 1/1. plan going Hawaii December i'm going end taking loss airfare cost. right happens evict whole city/town? 

there'd tens hundreds thousands roaming streets pandemic lmfao... 

its actually possible. Campania lockdown? someone tell regulations region place? Next up, 9months! Yeeaaah can't that. Like still live roghts you. \*Hitler enters Chat\* least 50k-75k already dead according current infected. Thats nearly garunteed next months. Makes wonder people realize 71k cases every day like signing death warrant least 1400 people every single day.

So next 2 months another 85k people perish along wiht 50-75k already die current cases.

when put perspective, im low balling real numbers frightening, end year sign death warrant another 135,585 people think fear waning, think exhaustion setting many. unfortunate many people developed world lack anything approaching resilience. We’re good one less state tbh I've pondering this, success seems coming combination national management cultural mentality.

You've got worst worst - US ridiculous un-leadership, heavily delegated controls, pricy healthcare etc along 'muh freedom' mentality.

You've got best best - NZ, SK Vietnam clear government direction, compliant/vigilant people.

Then middle got whole bunch incompetent governments (Spain, think?) arrogant publics (UK). Lmao sorry fam time mental didnt outweigh correct? always said agree point mental aspect outweigh physical, need glad people still think point yet LOL, still first wave, suppressed. wait 1 month see. Greetings Germany Snobbery? Reddit? Say ain’t article says Oklahoma shut spread public don’t tools eliminate yet. think kind human nature want blame someone...though guess said really agree part comment either. 13 year old expressed frustration China, keep telling her: this, could easily something else. look ""stupid"" eat exotic animals whatever, meat exactly pristine here, either.  far, salmonella e-coli outbreaks devastating. Many countries successful lockdowns implemented rigorous testing, clear rules broad safety nets citizens. class snobbery say US used resources make sure lockdowns successful giving people money correct information. America decided people get what, 1 time payment $1200?? American millionaires got millions covid loans without oversight? americas failure (or success politician gave friends loads taxpayers money country distrated) Ehh, scientific works much like, ""woohooo see told you"". Although much less vocal way lol. Scientists intuition, bayesian terms, prior knowledge, formulate hypotheses Intuition, run experiments, collect observations, emperically prove disapprove hypothesis. 

And far know, consensus there, T-cell lasting long natural thing expect. Primary role T-cells long lasting immunity. present, scientists expect stay. 

Meanwhile, share concerns protective immunity is? sterilizing, lead mild symptoms. clear answer this, hope best. wanna say line, people sub really hope best.  Fuck off. Let people enjoy lives. Since can't literally 100% free 100% controlled, room disagree scale be? can't freedom harm freedom controll. let us accept restricting movement quickest way stop spread virus, mean restrict movement? Well, depends. hit Bezos billions? Yeah... ample evidence people ""responsible""... work Reinfection hardly issue. long term immunity simply dominates amount reinfections we've seen count one hand. Can't seem find info. really, many bodies stack refrigerated trailer. 50?

Edit: 56 84 evidently. California needs mask mandate doesn’t cater liars!  jump insults. said there's door. Yikes! could be? Could bite? friend experienced similar blistering reaction unseen bite--he bitten venomous spider changing light bulb. hope OK! Ah mixed comments. actually agree children unlikely die, disagree stupid ""late term abortions"" comment. 

Just children less likely die, however, mean matter get infected, due household spread. would extremely useful release app. People would download 'test' cough could help determine get actually tested. something like would put mind ease son croup cough earlier year.  Yeah, I’m gonna try copy minute. it’s loooong I’ll need get actual computer. 😬 I’m sure we’ll start paying attention Biden wins need overlay mortality rate age demographic balance causes illness Covid may factor health complications flu past coronavirus colds. think anyone advocating 'constant lockdown' ... America even lockdown, businesses schools trying accommodate lack coordinated governmental plan best keep incurring hardships sick dying workplace lack production brings. need spikes required 'lockdown' type throughout lifecycle virus, spread across different communities response fair virus. city sees spike stricter rules regulations businesses open, capacities, distances etc. businesses requiring facial coverings such. 

It's like kid covered paint running around house kid keeps yelling can't stifle freedom one parent saying ""nah, he's going get everything kids going going mess, needs go bathroom get clean"" parent saying ""Screw it, need house, many kids anyway."" Paywall lmaoooo swear vaccine updates jerk shareholders respective pharma corp. wide vaccine use wont even thing 2022. could go all-in call Republican party. states, testing generally slows weekends, deaths not. virus spreads people spend significant amount time together close contact - e.g. talking 15mins party, meeting room together etc.

We know stop virus - stop people different households getting close contact other.

What trouble denialists defeatists, would spread propaganda, get way necessary public health measures. honest going harder longer project root fix Covid.  jump onto insults? 

Regardless topic study, 104 people single small region provide absolutely basis generalization. No... respiratory diseases transmit across innocent basic human interactions, much might like deny it, humans social creatures social interaction human need much food water. nothing called self-centeredness unintelligence humans.

Viruses part nature, humans gods/above nature.  Travel nurses took crisis contracts flocked NYC hotspots early pandemic. Trouble is, everywhere becoming hotspot. time simply enough staff cover many needs many places once. Meanwhile School Glad wound better place! guy sounds like jerk. hope &amp; family stay healthy &amp; safe saying this?

That overweight everyone feel apathetic him? Dammmmmmmmnnnnnn. Cool, let people fun. simplifying point paid sick leave guaranteed US. closest come unpaid sick leave conditions.  Antigen test, meaning antibodies? literally says website PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED SHIPPED UNITED STATES.

For thermometer masks says shipped US. walked local quik-e-mart, woman behind counter pulling dicknose, singing full volume middle store. Blowing sides mask. walk store again. Slovak, might add additional info.

The whole project started week ago 4 counties hit virus most. Roughly 140k people came (91% people come - people 10-65 years-old). 5 600 positives, 4% tested. get tested go work.

This week whole population. 3.8m eligible Slovaks, 3.6m came, 38359/1.06% tested positive. 99.2% testing sites open. Success. get tested self-quarantine 10 days (they can't go work outside walk, essentials like buy food).

What's interesting compare many people tested positive week ago 4 first counties. Roughly 50% reduction positives, PCR positives week also dropped!

Some counties tested positive low 0.33% (our capital city example).

Tests used - antigen (not antibody) rapid tests. came, got tested, waited 15 minutes got result. Everybody social distanced wore masks, safer going supermarket. Almost conflicts, everything went peacefully.

The goal reduce number cases, completely eliminate virus, even caught 50% active tests (according studies), still massive success. We'll see numbers change next weeks. hit counties tested next weekend.

It cost roughly 100m euros. One day total lockdown would cost country 100m euros anyway project happened, would gone 2-3 weeks long lockdown (said PM epidemiologists). would say much much better.

Any questions? Fair enough Oh absolutely, comment stated whole specifically China handling things.

I personally don’t believe word coming Chinese government, trust China however done exactly stellar job reporting information making right decisions administrative level.

It’s sucks become polarized subject finding accurate information daunting task. shouldn’t case global pandemic. Can't die quietly sight? /s talking about. EU cases USA harder economic fall government fault. personal responsibility stay healthy. Unrelenting pessimism likely last much longer pandemic ever US 'surge' much compared Switzerland, today announced 21,926 cases three days, that's equivalent 833,188 US cases, 277,729 cases last three days--Belgium announced today US equivalent 330,000 cases, France 262,000 cases US equivalent, even Netherlands 160,000 US equivalent today Yes, think part problem. Also, case count grown far beyond capacity contact tracing contacts positives told isolate. remember right, head institute health mentioned limit contact tracing would reached around 100 cases per day. currently average almost 700/day. far late need second lockdown politicians yet unwilling admit defeat. next week, think left choice. know people continue think eradication disease still realistic goal. many people there, what’s stopping people giving false name?

Hold till produce I'd/check clears. Make like posting bond. however plethora evidence suggests people responsible bubbles social distancing- neither happens party cases diminished. don’t put word mouth didn’t claim would two weeks people wore masks. however claim people stop making stupid decisions like going parties potential super spreaders. nice try, cigar Agreed, pandemic ends hospitals morgues aren’t taxed. okay? original comment responding said ""I realize Florida really late term abortions"". universe implies thought children unlikely die. Yea could huge, example end swab PCR test New Zealand get hundred thousand false positives compared couple hundred cough test 

This would efficient, convienient, cheap. fact used various devices remove device bias means definitely potential able use phones record ur test mean? That's news me. Bats transmit viruses humans intermediate hosts, almost never directly bats. It’s thought intermediate host may mink. you’re describing eradication. iirc... AstraZeneca’s vaccine shown produce antibody cell responses weren’t obedient. England Germany (for example) issues anti-masking like US. china’s concentration camps... :( mandate, law. signed legislature, law-making arm government.

The mandate passed gov extended emergency power mandate well beyond spirit law allows, mandates shaky legal ground successfully challenged nationwide. Population El Paso County 620,000. 0.5% would 3,000. many bodies mobile morgue hold? know sadder set two words 'Mobile morgue' :( Oh hey, thanks coming NoNewNormal LockdownSkeptics, door thataway. Jesus wept definitively, guarantee kids won’t die Covid? can’t. 

My kids play pool, know swim. taught improve odds dying water. took precaution protect them. put helmets bike. make sure proper seating restraints car travel. take necessary precautions help odds. 

With virus, best protection unknown certainty dying it, prevent getting first place. Odds show kids aren’t dying. still dying don’t always know causes happen. Fair point, know much deadly typical. thumb rule is, severity can't predicted typical virus is, however binary-ish things like whether T-cells expected not, whether body particular defence mechanism predicted seeing similar virus viruses Yeah, essentally eradicate stop close contact animals. Bird swine flu hard do, bats easier propaganda deflection administration trying hide fact make nothing soil anymore, including critical protective gear. Protect family else Oof hate hear that. Thanks link though ! seen varying estimates constitutes herd immunity virus. One paper read said need 90%, another said 60% people don’t actually interact many others outside small sphere.
The US population ~330 million. would need 500,000 new cases day entire year reach 60% exposure. We’re close.

That said HEARD IMMUNITY VIABLE WITHOUT VACCINE. Sorry caps, important. Proposing heard immunity without vaccine means 60-90% population would get sick. many millions would die? many would left debilitating life long conditions? since I’m talking US, many would left medical debt could never pay off? 

Smallpox similar herd immunity range. wreaked havoc thousands years. eradicated effective vaccine population willing take it. rely herd immunity make virus “just go away”, still still killing people long, long time. leaders “experts” suggest viable option understanding either science, value human life. We’re state sub! couldn’t agree though. spring summer, discussions good informative. it’s constant doom gloom, shaming restaurants/bars following Pritzker’s orders, “lockdown forever.” longer say different opinion without downvoted attacked. I’ve stopped reading lot recently come (which never thought would happen). wedding initially thought would ok (outdoors campground, limited people), unfortunately reality bit iffy. 
The reception still inside large cabin area, Me, wife, maybe four guests ones masks on. guests took food outside eat, least people table mocked us wearing masks, including one ER nurse. stand corrected, thanks. Sorry loss, friend thousands healthy 34 year olds die.  Dr. Acton gone, see real adults Ohio's earlier handling virus. morons taken Governor want upset severe criticism harassment Acton caused her appointed successor — Dr. Joan Duwve, served South Carolina’s public health director since April — quit hours DeWine introduced September Like three-quarters American men 60% women. wanna say? many americans risk matter age deniers antimaskers begin take serious? Yes agree. 'Swimming lake'?? heated? So, name public health, want put setting far likely negative public health consequences? everyone used brain beginning, government sent stimulus right away also ordering mandatory lockdown, wouldn’t position. required SOLIDARITY, something everyone failed at. doesn’t help portions America locked periodically— needed TIME. lower class people refused lock went work fear money, upper middle class thought dramatic kept going out, locked along everyone else, would’ve control. much freedom bad thing. chose ignore it, chose enforce it— look now... fucking mess. government power force lockdowns everywhere everyone start... would’ve back work normal months ago, selfish fucks chose pick time place. Ironic, isn’t it? economy lives would’ve good stopped idiots month stayed home. Lower class would fine already, yada yada.... can't required years. necessary get sick. title article January 2020? yet agree still factor. shouldn’t hold individuals responsible then? federal government failed us regards making testing widely available/did improve ability contact trace. isn’t have? Doom posting trolling oddly cathartic. feels great say something expresses worst fear possible outcome downvoted it, like least know “general public” whatever counts reddit, doesn’t want distance years vaccine.

I suspect that’s part motivation alts. comment implied children would likely die.

Yeah, no, comment implied children unlikely die, IFR 18's insignificant. 

The problem dying children, like, all. 

The problem spread. think someone thread say wearing mask take care  Every day, see another article either claiming contradicting it. get it- understanding virus still evolving. problem even - someone much supports science evolves- find rolling eyes longer wanting believe anything read. I, tomorrow contradicted? us limited ability process new information, yet inundated new information us don’t even educational background critically analyze. 

Think widespread impact could population already struggling adapt. Sometimes really feel like would better studies accessible general public thoroughly reviewed concluded relevant informative subject. isn’t like masks... need widespread adoption masks immediately, appropriate disseminate info quickly even though means sometimes giving wrong advice. knowing long immunity lasts something help general public moment crisis. anything, inappropriately gives people permission practice pandemic hygiene, think they’re immune. feel like problem China lack coverage they're doing. mean, look, get it, get it, there's strong chance mild case judging health history. Small chance mild. get wrong, wear mask that, small social circle, interact elderly. 

But know hung preventing people, seem view ignorant, getting sick. want badly understand seriousness small chance get significantly sick. business body. devoting mental bandwidth it? Here's latest case/death charts state 46.35 deaths per 100k. ranks #28 per capita state currently #7 7-day average per capita deaths (hot like people get reddit is...  Outdoors brief duration low risk, use rough estimate. Based descriptions, even child tested positive would worry much. hmm true..kinda lame, important suppose Exactly, people keep saying winter spreader ""people outside much"" mentioned enough summer produce higher air humidity evaporation breath becomes easier aerosolised winter lower humidity :( 

Yay planthoarding tendency! :) It’s amazing job turn total shit new boss “great” yet? Ah yes, Boomer Motto. Yeah suicides drug overdoses /s mistranslation? see possible 3 billion doses ready _start_ 2021. seems beyond crazy me, far beyond even optimistic estimates I've ever seen.  Lol sounds like weed covid simple. Antigen tests insensitive maybe yield 50% success people day 2-6 infection. Haha surprisingly think lot people catch reference. Every time heard ""Wuhan"" March beginning this, song would get caught head. thing responsible Redditor would do, made sarcastic alt account it. 

Believe not, name without _ already taken! January weren’t even paying attention virus. knew nothing Wuhan locked down.

The day found SCMP video January 4th wished could go back. 

[Mystery illness outbreak Wuhan, China - Jan. 4, Yea, that's key point. rapid deadly outbreak novel virus scorch earth managed. Imho- covid perfect wakeup call perfect storm. Thing is, could perfect storm easily something mild like H1N1 (just using simple example. implying H1N1 big deal) One interview subjects made comparison.

She doctor originally Poland claims fired insisting wearing mask.  saying cannot find work much Sweden support masks.

Anyone criticizes Tegnell Sweden around sure hit onslaught pro-Swedish whiners, including American conservatives dislike. nothing monkeys. head Oxford vaccine team said sterilizing immunity unlikely. googled bit can't find original article read months ago. Here's find tho 14 countries still cases per capita u.s? saying u.s great, unless I'm misunderstanding title lying. also social welfare, Australia increased unemployment benefits $750 fortnight introduced new benefit “JobKeeper”, also $750 fortnight help employers keep employees paid even work shut non essential. 

It wasn’t perfect, many people missed out, particular casual gig economy workers money cut back (although starting reopen due single figure daily cases). 

My state introduced one payments $350 people didn’t sick leave (again, casuals, gig workers, contractors) self isolate waiting test result $1500 payment tested positive couldn’t work fortnight. 

We socialist country, social democracy, vulnerable need supported otherwise fucked. 

Before anyone comes back point gaps, yes, heaps mistakes made, I’m writing in-depth analysis here, pointing can’t expect people isolate financially supported so. test much! /s disgusting, considering still stories hospitals reuse PPE, surprising that's we're U.S. Inaccurate. According worldometers, Belgium total cases per capita. countries even cases, they're quite small. Halloween like normal year steroids people flocking streets like salmon Capestrano, also church mke suburbs halloween service around 100 cars lot. going get even worse WI fall/winter People seem shadowboxing issue. hard limit overloaded hospitals. hospitals still overloaded despite weak vaccine, masking social distancing continue required. That’s things be. beautiful cases world Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wow, that's functioning government looks like. societies proper social safety net, effective governance, accountable democracy

you realize countries world refers to? seems un-paywalled, read now. So, word 'could' lot heavy lifting sentence.

In next paragraph family member close contact positive survivors reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. patients continued wear masks observe social distancing recommendations, makes ""very difficult affirm whether patients really contagious,"" researchers note.

In words, admit outside possibility also state evidence transmission ""The key technical problem, discussed, viral RNA signal PCR assay necessarily mean infectious virus present,"" Karn said. added new comprehensive viral RNA analyses would needed answer question.

They clearly acknowledge quite possible test triggered without ""In respect, trying better understand persistence long-time positive RT-PCR test COVID-19 really correlated potential contagiousness,"" add.

I would say thorough, long, long, LONG way suspecting people still infectious. fact, would say opposite: expectation infections, want continue monitor people absolutely certain. politicians cowards morons care image tough virus, regardless much unseen damage actions might cause put comparison North Korea. I’ve seen articles criticizing Tegnell throughout pandemic. user used post articles every day. Congratulations achievement, you’ve unlocked “ Darwin Award” Yeah. accomplishment outbreak one state. majority country virus control long time went serious lockdown could join rest country close covid-free. far it’s worked well. haven’t community transmission 50 days state last time case dealt effectively. It’s heartbreaking see what’s happening things heading there. think election year US worst possible thing could happened guys. Things become much politics enough science health advisors recommend. lucky part politicians referred health experts advice do. governor looks like one good ones, although she’s work cut her. remember armed protestors April. Crazy see - especially gun controls would never see anyone walking around gun. 

Thanks well wishes regarding bushfires. Hopefully season nothing like last time. silver lining due international coverage fires last season it’s possible deterred many tourists coming bringing virus them. 

Look loved ones. would everything possible limit exposure outside house try ride out. Good luck! taking account things like free healthcare bud. scrape pennies together incase break leg. Ok. argue you.

I indian, never there. never shudda said anything india.

It timely met indian coworker, asked things said, quote, “india fucked”. lives states parents live india. said many parents’ friends dying day. 

If know something india dont, i’m sure you’re right. know nothing india indian friends tell me. That's misleading. antigen tests ""effective"" certain viral load. i've seen usually day 2-6 infection. 1% antigen positivity rate huge. Facebook PhD's told deaths lowering...i trust would never lie Ready 6 months :| live 3 roommates found one *may* exposed covid. employee work tested positive saying department. course action? quarantine roommate comes back negative test?  quarantine *I* get negative test? okay continue normal (I maintaining social distance always wear mask public)? definitely not, unless manage find buy one ourselves.

Thanks responding....yeah, I'm beyond disgusted right PPE. thing that's worrying still can't scientifically exclude possibility zombie plague.

I know know, zombie virus would actually unprecedented nervous system affectation brain parasite, seriousness around year documented instances people fell ill still ill day.

We know thing works yet beyond basics. Think 6 months AIDS epidemic.

Our current actual scenario apocalyptic appears damn near close get act together.  much winning. That's deep shit Inconvenience + entitled people = bunch whiny babies minimum way complete denial facts reckless behavior. really ugly watch show 24/7 since April....

My wife commercial lines insurance including small large group health insurance. Carriers already assesssing whether covid positive pre-existing condition not. Anyone thinks never happens literally ostrich entire head deep sand....  Yes. 

And happens people whose livelihoods depend people going restaurants bars? people needed support. small business owners, servers, bussers, bartenders. need support.

Yes, people stay home. take care people can't work people staying home. Wear mask vote safely tomorrow! math UBI, extremely expensive benefit money almost guaranteed go immediately back economy. like don’t know would ever find keep running. 

But agree would completely abolish current government funded programs like welfare, food stamps unemployment benefits, maybe even social security unless UBI ages 21-65 something like that. either way it’s expensive shit. Victoria Australia we've rather long onerous lockdown, case numbers high early found transmission among workers either tested working symptoms even continuing work positive test.
The state government announced workers entitled sick leave would receive $150 awaiting test results $1500 tested positive needed isolate 14 days, also set scheme people could isolate hotel rooms home environment difficult, government's expense.
It seems effective, got case numbers way recorded fourth straight day without new infections, we've gone around 8000 active cases peak 50 today.
So doable, government supportive. seems like actually learned something COVID, unlike someone else... Poor George Russell government never voluntarily give back power granted them.  need learn little world. Hunger poverty lockdown restrictions kill covid *right now*.

Not advanced societies proper social safety net, effective governance, accountable democracy. I'm sorry live place. complete ignorance. higher CFR widespread testing April. I'm arguing anymore. cast ballot today hopefully put hands people competent. good day. No, in, see couple class, spread multiple classes. check extracurriculars find they're team indoor activity without masks, example. legitimate. reason multiple cases traced back party family gathering. completely random untraceable careful large outbreaks overwhelm ability contact trace. they’re problem. “I wear masks public” totally matter you’re inviting 10 friends drinks every week they’re going going drinks families going drinks friends, maskless “I trust safe”

It’s what’s driving current massive increase cases inevitable increase deaths. ? 

Not sure going this. Yes, social norms back different, different time.  also different cave man times.  I'm sure cave men would think totally big deal isolate. buy crap late -- clothes, housewares, etc. either deny death count attributing different methods accounting casualties else claim others bound catch them. talking about?

Tegnell says masks proven effective. talking about? Put another way, Trump grabbed AR15 started shooting followers, would able shoot many followers rally. civil stating beliefs. somehow pretty sure

People see word ""self"" title assume blaming citizens able quarantine isolate, article *actually* puts blame lies that's government able provide citizens need isolate/quarantine. Countries like Singapore South Korea specific facilities people isolate, course, people worry losing jobs time. Even Sweden, everyone's favorite country, paid leave people symptoms people need quarantine. 

Once cases easily traced, cases withdrawn general population recover, even mild cases. alternative able keep track cases exponential growth happens, everyone lockdown everyone gets punished bureaucratic failure. teacher MN here. definitely not, unless manage find buy one ourselves. school got teacher cloth mask school logo (I would rather two blank ones likely price...), provide blue disposable masks provide kids.

Basically, non-zero amount poop EVERYTHING. Ft Bliss? *Laughs rural American* statement 100% fact. Anyone questions bad also messed needs watch videos Jan Feb compare information shared scientists, epidemiologists, others knew happening, coming, shared truth.

Anyone remember delays officially calling covid pandemic $$$ many would miss on? one hell show. winter coming, it’s getting started, sadly. Stay safe folks — stay educated ahead “information curve” severely lagging. Serology studies hard good. may provide clues use methods place compare different time. trust calculate mortality rate infection rate. expecting anything expectation enough people willing get it.

Fuck. angry sad done. Understand - funny, us international people know depth issue. headline points. outside perspective, guys solid.

Appreciate response deeper insight country going through, leaders have/have done.

In Melbourne Australia swear 1 week media stirring alt right protest shitstorm. extremely sick media here... absolutely destructive society. cockiness Europeans sub back early summer incredible. handful countries credibly brag pandemic response. top list South Korea Vietnam. European country except perhaps Slovakia list. understand likely due things. level poverty live in. They're less likely many work home jobs all. can't afford go work. can't afford take kids school daycare. health may already compromised poverty correlated many preexisting conditions thst risk like diabetes asthma. 

They're mostly hispanic. cultural differences around gatherings, multi generational homes, importantly often ignored comes emergency resources aid. coincidence Texas noth largest cities primarily hispanic much impoverished large cities. 

Their hospitals inadequate start. already reached capacity sending people home die once. dont staff, equipment, space increase numbers assist lile places able do. another factor poverty also issue. far cities, can't ship sick hospitals like we're seeing Idaho Utah, Belgium, Poland, places. hope letting American tourists come in. There's definitely whole bunch people would like go Australia right escape would probably bring virus Wow tell working logistics? watched doc hospital London used year’s supply O2 3 days install tanks. look management faces professional could feel fear Yeah, let’s ignore reality tough issues. everyone going willing honest.

Then start implementing fines people lie jeopardize public safety. basically cornerstone every cases asymptomatic spreading around.

Yeah, that's masks social distancing for. That's contact tracing quarantines/isolations meant also lethal all.

It's projected kill 5-6 times people maximum estimate flu deaths period. That's without considering reported deaths likely undercounted. 

Who cares 300k people die though, right? It’s like it’s ever going happen idiots proudly talking brave anti-mask actions social media. Others found videos protests wild Karen moments.

It wouldn’t difficult prove many them. One roommate refuses even discuss pandemic 

he's freaking denial. wish luck. True remember want call pandemic... CDC lost credibility beginning. know hoping best - really quiet acceptance ridiculousness got place done without complicity.

I talking outside experience either - left USA GW started latest rounds permanent war - kinda latest ramification rampant deconstruction facts country. Anyway - stay safe. Yet, Trump hold rallies thousands people.  Wait we're planning resuming normal lives Wednesday? It’s design. mean fair risk population small lockdowns going cause many lose jobs. there’s really way please everyone. ""Clay Jenkins locking people wearing masks""

That seriously put edge. reason two face Abbott ""couldn't"" originally mask mandate. spread adults time Thanksgiving.

the circle virus. holiday season going suck. thanksgiving 26 days, it'll ok kids/parents quarantine. USA nationwide like 7% read book while. Ontario larger population Illinois. 1000 cases 10 deaths, government freaks takes caution. wild me; like everyone agree different approaches government different tradeoffs. ""Big government"" approaches best managing shared costs. pandemic, one person's recklessness creates risk everyone large, social approach beneficial public health outcomes. talk liberty environments individuals actions affect others less so, pretend dynamic different this? said vote. I’m telling it’s split voting won’t fix it. It’s like get vote minimum wage school funding. US built oppression runs fuel. early on, serious illness making news. Inlike now, maas test everyone Melb mild winters similar chicago im size density. Again, child, verifying moderators. Follow guidelines don’t. That’s choice. None would problem people fuck supposed do. work school, 100% fact tell outside extracurriculars (which going on), we've little transmissions inside classroom settings despite positive cases classrooms. That's terrible ventilation. Why? able pull strict 6+ft social distancing, everyone wears masks, teachers school wear KN95/KF94/N95 grade masks.

However, point high community transmission rates simply overwhelm whatever precautions have. going end true Americans.  Trump's death cult better fucking pray show empathy compassion shown us past 4 years.  politics anymore pure evil hatred. exactly. Executive action. 30+ proclamations Governor. headed shit show country. concur. god, that's like half population SD. /s Despite holding office 4 times last 32 years, Republicans popular vote twice. consider blatant election fraud states like Georgia unmitigated gerrymandering throughout country, extremely disingenuous look results say Americans actually wanted 4 terms Republicans president.

It far accurate say Americans wanted ratio 2:6, government sufficiently corrupt disallow happening. traveler isolation

before *we eat them* Lmao wrong make IgG antibodies quickly memory B cells previous infection Break party, send home, hope much damage already done. That's really expect happen situation general announcement requesting attendees get tested. described organizers event cooperative told shut down. one arrested, Cannon said criminal charges would considered organizers hosting mass gathering without permit.

that'll show bad consequences? Absolutely nothing /s Hard lockdown really seem work. soft lockdowns happening around world still allow movement across cities schools stay open, mandated enforced safety measures kicking road.

You think hard lockdown detrimental economy? Try many softer lockdowns throughout year completely eroding consumer business confidence combined overworked healthcare system. number country. question also good quarantine police officers catching break rules? Jesus christ, exaggerate get sick sidewalk

This shit isn’t plague, death rate less 1%. Utahns Utahn'?  Americans become dumb 14 day incubation period. rationed healthcare would never happen Private Profit, Free Market system !!! /s fun proving one court. Hey least wear mask you’re sick please could help prevented getting lot people sick flu :) lwe can't pick choose

Yes, know. That’s guidelines local federal. **Of course** take target environment account. would feel go erp cared people vs caring short term election propaganda rule rich few? work, would fired. would also like know Lmao I’m saying said different way hopes you’ll realize stupid sounds say said. 

“Y’all willing die go restaurant?”

I hear shit like every day sub. Covid isn’t nearly lethal make sound. They’re walking bombing zone go pub. IFR very, low unless you’re elderly immunocompromised. Florida concept point tbh recently tried point cousin Facebook, conveniently refused accept point - mortality end all. disease infects many thousands people, even small percentage need hospitalisation, *swamp* hospitals, hideous knock effects. many people can't extrapolate beyond end nose. become movement. stupid interjection baseless information Illinois left leaning state! mother retired ICU medical director. repeatedly says issue ICU beds per se. shortage skilled doctors, nurses, respiratory pharmacy techs etc. April, hot spots (NYC, Detroit, NEw Orleans, etc able recruit travelling nurses techs. time around shortages looming place. Hospitals bidding one another people.

She concerned hospitals best ICU people action caught virus (and died). Others exhausted. believes combination fatigued demoralized experienced people leading others may ICU experience dangerous - especially since ICU's would usually assign two patients nurse, assign four six.

I also heard concern also availability drugs used ICU's. COVID patients tend much longer ICU stays people reasons, consume drugs. could respite front since apparently early evidence suggests criteria used use mechanical ventilation made restrictive. patients better helped CPAP (or CPAP proning ). lower demand paralytics, sedatives pain meds. Ooh internet tough guy here. alternate spelling ""the federal government""? Belgium also 5% infected first wave ~0 summer. US much better position ~15% infected spring summer (though unlike countries, we've never bothered try determine accurately, could certainly debate based little data have).   Remember every student partying. select are, represent majority. Einstein h-index 44 (but different world back Truest shit here.

For record 100% asshole here. that's said likely  Much shortages masks, remember beginning year global PPE deficit, countries standing other's faces get big share scarce mask supply could, number organisations lied masks public effort ration supply PPE, mistake  deficiency addressed people trotting statements stripped context try say masks useless. Great job USA, managed un-flatten curve enough enough resources treat everyone! like warned! want die Great White attack, expectation.  point going doctor good? doctor know enough long term effects help? got March June recovered enough functional. still struggle heart palpitations flushing. migraines gotten much worse last 3 months. makes really amazing Iran's population much younger Western countries. look size vulnerable population, Iran's outbreak seems one worst.  know people think they're overcounting I'm like nah, they're undercounting. Fauci basically Einstein infectious diseases? possible outcomes? New mutations time like flu one suppose. Many countries fucking bad. don’t hear everyone likes shit US reason. Yeah looked title made assumption. Shouldn’t have. 

Am watching YouTube vid now, thanks sharing it!

Yes, -90 going expensive hospitals adhere too. -80 super low expensive do. freezer capable dropping even lower too. probably -100 so. surprising thing dictatorial communist countries got doctors hiden laboratories making vaccines pills purple kind lol seems none deal shit absolutely true (for Britain US), unpopular people like simple narratives get point people side aisle say ""it's fault!"" Lol think anyone actually fined here? friend - it’s talk idiots getting away literal murder consequences. think one guy Canada charged breach quarantine act, he’s one organizing anti masker rallies.
Our enforcement joke numbers getting hand again. US boutta cop Diamond Play Button Pft, feel guilty attending party 11 people outside wearing mask? Yeah, still do. needed tell someone. think read something there. epidemiologist quoted saying makes sense. 20 % antibodies reduce reproduction lot believed big part ""hidden"" immunity t-cells might 40 % immune point. one knows level immunity needed population stop spread perhaps hoping 60%. Obviously wrong since sharp increase cases Stockholm now.
Let's keep fingers crossed level immunity big enough Stockholm help break exponential trend. Many parts Sweden going (I think) struggle more.
The articles talk strategy quote taken seriously. strategy would failure according quote since Stockholm mentioned high immunity. Also top vaccine candidates require 2 doses think 3-4 weeks apart still weeks second dose antibody levels really get high What's difference going grocery store thousands people walk ? someone goes work, uses public transport, lives building shared facilities impossible track contagion comes Today, filed official complaint Atlas American Medical Association due lack ethics continued spread false information. small action made feel like voice - especially considering politicians choose ignore constituents. would encourage everyone same! There’s also chance undetected asteroid impact house, directly hit head killing sleep. opinion , would motive 'them' make us continue wearing masks reason? like trolling us, think? ??? Yeah buffalo would farther going cross state nyc. practical medical emergencies Made lol feel like locked Summer would riots. can’t keep Australians inside summer Literally Taiwan media February blast leaked horror footage Wuhan loop. kept people home. #1 !

Best country world! Exactly. Testing much. People clearly curb behavior there, testing alone going save them. Bro...bro... shes like really really hot? 


Lol people still make out. symptoms. get symptoms get tested. Asymptomatic people spread main drivers pandemic.

Edit: True, consider underreporting. know everyone Russia could dead already. USA precisely punishment Americans deserve. us certainly be.  Keep up.  People done getting pushed around purposely put danger start pushing back HARD. take money nothing, police r joke. heard el paso cops straight refused enforce mask mandate. ridiculous Hmmm. articles February 2020. 2018. Every winter, happens. hospital administrators aren’t prepared, that’s fault. addition, flu cases year, that’s even room COVID want pedantic guess. still face consequences violating EO US like Europe collection states borders can’t unilaterally closed ways limited federal authority step State business.

And yes, get cases 1,000 lock 5 million you’re good shape. point though. think US thousands tens thousands cases time testing started ramping up.

Plus I’d argue US far air traffic Australia New Zealand, presents different problem/solution set. 

For Europe, agree, cases accelerating past US daily per capita case count is, afford lockdown 3 months again? long go well economically destroyed COVID resurging?

The liberty dying alone understaffed ICU, truly muh freedoms Bullshit. New Yorkers believe science empathetic, community-minded people. Maybe FL would true, NY!!! straight-up lose shit. aunt's funeral afternoon. loving, giving, life-affirming person could ever meet. Super active 67, driving force across three entire generations. THREE generations family absolutely ruled, loved, &amp; lost without her. I'm grieving. angry, anger strong, takes grief. I'm ridiculously mad know even place feelings safely. Thank link bunch information it. I’ve sub awhile get information provided. 

Let say differently. Japan end January mid-February. result information available then, purchased N-99 mask brought gloves hand sanitizer way Japan. So, get it.

But, someone throws shitty neck gaitor nose calls mask, it’s harm good it’s protecting goddamn thing.

At least person wearing mask might think taking step back. Someone crap masks think protected passing long virus “following science.” aren’t clarifying science.

If candidates want mandate masks might well mandate masks actually effective, backed science testing, provide information public.

Otherwise I’ll pull shirt call good! obviously stupid. actually jobs shit going continue taking personal fucking responsibility muppets keep crapping about. mean...it's exactly ""word street"" literally said discussed numerous times publicly. Fauci citation h-index 222 ~20 considered good 50-100 makes leader field.

""Hirsch estimated 20 years ""successful scientist"" would h-index 20, ""outstanding scientist"" would h-index 40, ""truly unique"" individual would h-index remember said there’d vaccine fall? lol capitalism people capital make rules unique Trump. entire country. *just now* getting recognition BIPOC movement.

Personally, pull mask I'm out, depending time day even one. iwill say least pull shirts something, trails I'm easy distance, super fucking annoying dealing lack respect fellow humans (shocker know dealing mormons.)

For reference I'm running Millcreek Canyon surrounding areas like Neffs Heughes daily. Well using government money subside people spreading COVID restaurants. checking make sure mentioned.

If people wanna know, simple Google search ""LA Sheriff"" news stories past week disgust really mask wearing Christmas ‘22 huh Protect airborne disease confuse facial recognition?

What's like? know two. 43 year old mom 27 year old son. 
Fuck shitty scumbag bully trying downplay virus. happened Florida maybe. NY. gonna outbreaks. Smells like panic last part really hit home...well said I've distancing masked since March/April. headline true we'll continue distancing/wearing masks vaccine, I'm done. I'm going back regular life. I'm late 20s, nothing worry refuse give youth this. 

The government give $$ vulnerable (seniors &amp; immunocompromised) let rest us get back living. Get IDs use phones GPS data blacklist ERs hospitals near capacity. Hey twatburger, intentional set measures like mandatory face masks full lockdown got us through. Americans thoroughly deserve USA. Putin doesn’t fair elections slogan isn’t

 “he poisoned father jailed babushka vote him” mean, are.  ...as “someone important...like, actor.” Awww hell no. We're letting anyone except Australians, permanent residents immediate relatives. them, there's still 14 day supervised mandatory hotel quarantine. We're letting 6,000 people per week there's 30,000+ Aussies stranded overseas. one's allowed either except reasons approved government. Hopefully 2022 we've told. Stay away please. 69 420. Love it. getting lasting immunity, pool susecptible infection growing faster rate immune we'll continious mitigations (or ""living it"" perhaps?)

Then there's also eradication outcomes consider, maybe mass testing and/or bubbles like AU &amp; NZ attempting.

I dont remember thread discussing it, believe argued mutates something less severe, could get something like cowpox/smallpox situation. ded, u dum...tis wat tit - tRump ""I surely wont get it. even young like flu me.""
And thats regardless live. shame, really. 

Here town germany we're people promoting big Halloween Party saying would last chance lockdown. dont even want know much people got infected pure stupidity. mutation people talking months? think one perfect examples end good show, instead Jeremy Bearimies stretched seasons.. I'm one people. got back march still can't breathe properly. likely I'll need inhaler rest life. Singularity, fail us now. I've return overseas Melbourne. reluctant beginning life elsewhere deep knew Australia never going fuck up. We're lucky country clever country. We've got really good, part. bad Americans think rest world exist. Pack up, boys. British beat Spanish Armada, Americans beat British legions. Chinese beat American coronavirus response.  Well yes can't control behavior, point getting hung change anything, mean affect me. cases Boulder, higher chance someone else care end getting sick somehow. 

I'm also lab course testing compounds Salmonella (specifically strain causes food poisoning humans typhoid fever-like symptoms mice) look potential new antibiotics would really hate see important research canceled semester (it already canceled 2 weeks). Expect mortality go hits elderly triage starts! problem Bergamo less covid deaths triage enforce caused load secondary deaths. Yes too! person know who's anti-lockdown antagonist Melbourne racist doctor uncle! health reasons, ""sovereign citizen"" nonsense (funny bc rest family work law human rights fine). Live Action Roleplay surely getting hands here! seen conspiracy theorist like wild years, using little trademark symbols everything try spook vague cowardly unwillingness actually say anything imply.

I kind forgot sort existed, feels like total blast past. wonder oldschool spooky vague insinuator learned behaviour picked recently. sister quit teaching job. preschoolers, required keep masks. basically spent day trying keep 6 feet apart cleaning things. much clean morning kids afternoon kids got lunch break anything. probably less lack material lack ofb healthy people  massive support among healthcare workers BLM protests may biggest insult Americans self-isolated point. Lmao, selfishness unique America. people even come dumb shit? ached something like returning Japan late March. wish could adopt habits countries work well use way.

By February practically everyone wearing masks Japan. places starting mandatory 1-pump sanitizer entry left.

Also, Japanese space toilets magical. longer lockdown deaths /s

Trump fans Thank you. Stay safe! Many people skip year things work/travel/whatever. think years people could make it, would one, right height pandemic vaccine might available mid next year. I've seen King Ralph. possibility.  plan needs change *now*. Waiting vaccine never option. absolute zero guarantee ever get one. likely, guarantees possible there. might one early 2021. might one early 2022. might get one 2222. might never get one.

Either way making policy based solution exist yet moronic. guys know Europe shutting place. 2-3 weeks ahead you, still time learn us. Generally speaking, yes. spread seemed associated religion following social distancing. Please tell robots really look like that.  Trump things like fine hurting right people. Agreed. anyone listens politician assholes ZERO qualifications make decisions beyond me.

Hey education health become federal matter? see outlined restrictions placed government founding documents.

Too bad universe governed exact math there's thing coincidence. coincidence way people say know unseen factors cause effect?

This one pretty obvious ;) 152 burials per day August, almost double month's historical average for last decade 82 funerals per day, according Jakarta Globe calculation based city administration's data stretched back 2010.

Even calculation excluded burials confirmed suspected Covid-19 victims, Jakarta still saw 114 new tombstones per day last IFR .2%. possible way many people going die next 2 months. We've also seen steep decline death rate compared April, extra high Cuomo put covid positive patients NY nursing homes... know, place people specifically risk live.

Beyond that, wasted time own. got scared virus 99.8% survival rate traded life away compliant tyranny. people fucking menace society.  Fuck China. one cares China China blame ills world.  fact dear leader 100% blame murdering 300k people. neighborhood trick treaters. candy spread pergola single one taken. yes, house plenty well lit way all. Houston, problem. wanna tell families dead survivable virus is? Even 1% mortality rate would mean 3 million Americans would die everyone got virus. Oh god bothering too. world. country well. Maybe think enough money afford effective treatment. many times need reiterate cannot make policy hypothetical future solution exist yet? able get multiple covid tests prior (international) travel last week. Granted, lived NYC, currently overwhelmed. got tested twice day since moving internationally, required results within 72 hours flight.

I went NYU Langone hospital system, got deep nasal PCR test batch/group tested. negative result later night.

I also got tested doctor day. (not deep) Nasal PCR, sent quest diagnostics. results two days.

Outside New York, imagine likely difficult get results, testing likely required symptomatic. science works.  Suspecting something true make true. Ah. meant say ""did"" course. Privacy thee Good god y’all! Ha, must nice knew grandpa 2019. know dead. tense issue.  fuck cares China? US significantly influence time pulled out.  saying US complicit China? Stop shifting blame. almost zero transmission outside wearing mask, 11 people risk even less. mods seem dice roll whether care sub.  people shrieking CDC fearmongering start this? TIL satellites count graves. strong everywhere sub vaccine shred effectiveness would make situation better way, it’s matter much much covid killing less people now. soon triage starts death numbers skyrocket! Anywhere Buckhead Citations needed  thing is, Sweden reports deaths delay 2 weeks. least worldometers, deaths added retroactively day person actually died. expect little bars death chart still go last 1-2 weeks coming days.

Also, re-opened senior care homes visitors early October remember correctly. guess reduces fatality rate infections September takes weeks care homes develop Covid clusters. think window containment closing celebrities influencers feel comfortable safe hanging friends indoors without mask? 

I know they're close friends family feel like maybe know something don't. seem pretty comfortable even broadcasting whole world Vote! good conversations ahead time. hospital ran bipaps high flows spring, first come first served. someone died respiratory support immediately called respiratory team tell machine available give someone else. depends human behavior. lockdown (not arguing it) people follow guidelines would successful bringing cases down. cases start go back months like we've seen several times. one plus side might delay enough cases vaccine.  found Google AMP links comment. normal links:

r/tihi actually. article today Wall Street surprising doctors many cases involve people whose original cases weren’t serious, undermining assumption patients mild Covid-19 recover within two weeks. Doctors call condition “post-acute Covid” “chronic Covid,” sufferers often refer “long haulers” “long-Covid” patients.

“Usually, patients bad disease likely persistent symptoms, Covid doesn’t work like that,” said Trisha Greenhalgh, professor primary care University Oxford lead author August BMJ study among first define chronic Covid patients symptoms lasting 12 weeks spanning multiple organ systems.

For many patients, said, “the disease bad,” symptoms like memory lapses rapid heart rate sometimes persist months. they'll blame Boomers Republicans Depends is. it’s major hospital, yes. local GP, pharmacy, clinic probably not. fridges/freezer may can’t get level coldness -89 degrees. We're talking causes covid even many people it. We're talking new cases. New cases based what's reported. What's reported based tests. Tests widely available relative last spring often times free charge. think would never consider lockdowns reasonable. 

Funny, get impression ""but lockdowns kill businesses!"" people. 

Lockdowns could *not* kill businesses measures like rent moratoriums subsidized paychecks employees weeks, get accused socialist, guess there's standards found among intellectually dishonest. Argentina working similar terms, getting ready vaccinate 6 million people Buenos Aires Province, dense urban area, population wise. logical starting point, due population density, bit also concentrates 30% Argentina's economy. goal 6 million people vaccinated two week time span.

We're expanding alcohol production well basic supplies, training worforce enormous nation wide campaign too, getting ready mid-december. We're building infraestructure first vaccines arrive, process goes smoothly fast possible. Yup. That's difference we'll continue see without federal mandate. point first world countries normal come back late 2021 WHATEVER reason literally said make sure people give trying contain virus still time.  right people give are.  point people need stop constantly fighting scientists doctors every single thing say do.  childish contrarianism. York truly nothing Georgia Nebraska regard

Nothing massively higher fatality rate per capita forced infected patients nursing homes filled at-risk seniors do. It’s Japan. Outside NY yeah. rules state state. Duh, it’s going better (assuming vaccine comes around then) won’t entirely People really bad understanding already stringent temps many vaccines require See. thing I’m concerned allergies cough practically year round. It’s I’m sick, read sick basically every day October may. Would become kind expected wear mask time? it, I’m thrilled one else Boy. Dystopia coming soon. CCP strong thread. “There simply exist example vaccinology vaccines effective mild disease effective severe disease,” said Dr. Philip Krause, deputy director vaccine office FDA’s Center Biologics Evaluation Research, Thursday’s hearing.

this another fear mongering headline. right article director vaccine office flat saying isnt vaccine today doesnt prevent severe disease prevents mild disease. ignorant immoral thing say. Per Fauci, they’ll likely needed next year. Again, incentive matter mandate get tested. mass testing, vast majority people going test negative people going pay business get tested sick. efficacy mass testing hinges participation rate population. age 18 23. one example it’s hard contain virus, imperfect people make stupid choices. Guess that's one reasons many choose go healthcare professions. schooling difficult enough. Dealing day day garbage like keeping cool head tempted bottle vice might lead career loss becomes much time.


I've people try talk nursing years. Come peaceful life driving semi. hold back laughter tell got many issues line work. What's really important look percent positivity rate country see whos higher.

Frances positivity rate still higher US means they're missing people testing US 7 day average 7.5% US vs 12% France means testing still lagging behind US. Yeah think disagree. Sorry drag unnecessarily haha. gripe much sometimes. saying ""it would even worse without masks"".

And we'll never know true. come texas, smaller state california, also tests less california


Has cases deaths california? helmet laws Ohio either. Jesus saves! /s Significant weight loss usually makes people look bit older face. Though idea that's case him. New Zealand businesses doing? think takes business degree understand less covid = business better livelihoods, short, strict measures = less covid. Less covid also puts less strain healthcare system, fewer man hours lost work well. went date girl last week. mostly outside make bit. texted two days later tested positive. I’ve tested twice since times negative. I’m still quarantining two weeks. Fortunately symptoms don’t know affects viral load it’s starting feel like virus getting closer home time around. first personal contact I’m aware I’ve virus. see nothing constructive contribute harass. watching listening news? consistently said we've gotten better treating infections better understanding virus works. They've saying since least August explaining summer surge deaths remained low. Lol no, steadily increasing, peak.during summer need honest yourself. second vaccine type effectiveness released, everything going back normal quick hurry. rest world trying beat shit seriously. masks 2022 really agenda would certainly discourage comply, however, hopefully ""until 2022"" refers things like nursing homes, doctors offices, etc, worst, big stadiums, bars restaurants. going need revolt. Bot fucked tell single virus disease achieved herd immunity with, without vaccine wasn’t trying present dichotomy, trying present shitty hand America dealt.  

We need two options didn’t get March whole country suffering far worse have.  

We needed strong federal leadership based science could pivot based developments science.  

Also leadership would acted based playbook developed prior leadership placed government official wuhan team government here.  Literally pandemic response playbook, thrown 2018 unnecessary. check temperature send way. months vaccine rolled out, we're done. Yeah can’t pull number ass like that, it’s unscientific illogical, especially coming rando known scientific background authority subject. OP back claims sort evidence. can’t, it’s irresponsible promote claims. urges China travel bans coronavirus cases soar past 20,000

Posted TueTuesday 4 FebFebruary 2020 6:14pm, updated TueTuesday 4 FebFebruary 2020

WHO director-general Dr Ghebreyesus said travel bans could add fear stigma. 300k dead end year, sounds plausible  remember delayed declaring pandemic weeks? waited Wuhan investigation govt destroyed evidence?

*Pepperidge farm remembers.* good thing Phase II vaccines shows nearly 100% effectiveness generating antibodies (and importantly neutralizing antibodies). kind crazy, given long going take population get vaccinated, person vaccinated, may act like 100% effective like life normal. main concern waning immunity. countered continually exposing vaccinated individuals antigen. think that's way we're going reach herd immunity levels. person originally replied to. Agree 100%, think got wires crossed. Yeah that's I've refused dine patio bust cousin/niece. family cautious all, cousin goes house parties, said little niece sick, they're treating like big deal. People accept lockdown vaccine here. Hopefully anyway. typically follow leaders tells them.

isn't leaders for

what's point leader hobble ignoring 90% time  Trumps sister- federal judge- confirmed cheated SAT, paid someone take him. Trump’s niece put book. Wish test taker would come forward...  It’s possible, certainly raise concerns medical professionals, first trimester fatigue really really intense even without Covid. went able run miles struggling get flight stairs falling asleep 7 pm. So, could related prior illness, also may pregnancy. hard. watch TV appearances May clear acting like hostage stockholm syndrome. answer questions directly, evasive spoke like politician, answering questions asked instead ones were.

I understand bad position go TV gonna bullshit whole time emphasize hand washing.

She redeeming really, early pretty bad. Try social distance public transportation. cramp in. wait 1 hr next one. reads like teen trying sound smart say anything would gotten rid covid continued ""lockdown"" time.

if somewhere world almost identical numbers Europe's summer numbers, eliminated lockdown actual expectation currently 50%. think lip injection industry! Note Madison, nurses told late hour reuse N95 masks days (even working COVID patients), remains national shortage. ICU beds filled, nurses PPE (shortage ICU nurses use overtime exhausting remain), exponential rise cases - doubling rate 37 days point means 60-70K positive cases per week first week December. 1.3% case fatality rate, we'll see nearly 1000 Wisconsin family members die week.  CFR increase young pass virus elderly, we'll likely see CFR increase 2-3% December January arrive.  Mitigation suppression measures implemented months ago prevent wave. sense locally extent crisis understood - room hospitals needing ICU care within 2-3 weeks. Yup, rolled bush's ""mission accomplished"" banner th celebrations I'm sure OP making loose prediction 18% CFR based 10% Italy back March.  years since I've roommates, exactly assholes? person paying rent trying micromanage live lives. Pandemic not, I'd damned someone paying rent tries tell live house. feel bad roommates. Lol says let spread, get herd immunity like guys want. mostly everyone get point


You're fine potentially 3.5 millions deaths? That's 1% us population body count? amount people died year far point time October 2018 US. Moreover, panic caused global economic upheaval, tons unrest, eroded civil rights, threw hundreds millions people poverty. Jason you? article clickbait doom porn. Seriously. Chinese call Secretary Tedros Chairman Xi. bad news - way others wearing masks W.H.O. support masks started getting pressured politics. Kick People say holidays like halloween places like disney safe taking precautions gatherings happen around things spread virus. six months ago Europe *did* control

then decided they'd rather go holiday

both countries shat bed bigtime, USA never really got control all, Europe within weeks Australia New Zealand, threw away go holiday Spain. asymptomatic people tested?

I trying make guess mortality rate (and also ratio asymptomatic carriers), bit lost.

There 46000 active cases (worldometer), slovakia 5 million ppl, 1% would mean another 50000 infected according weekend's testing (because 50% ppl went, doubled number).

That's 100 000 (or double counting) people infected/active.

Daily deaths around 7-10 (worldometer).

So calculate (or estimate) actual mortality rate? 🎶Florida concept 

By measure 

Our pain 

I'll say again.. 🎵 true, can't blame someone wanting hide medical diagnosis others. He's King he's next line. Yet people make claims without ever able provide sources. think people New Zealand suffering things Americans currently are? like issue lies uncontained outbreak.

Also, healthcare workers overburdened people refuse follow simple measures. They're count though, right? I've never seen anyone give birth

Babies myth Sheriff's elected directly wide latitude regarding discretion. thread comical. Explain how? Explain one human contact? It’s stupid argument party 10 people part problem. 

I’ve sat home months, worn mask everywhere go, quarantine one time contact someone Covid, due job get tested weekly (though I’m exposed, it’s stipulation union).

Really you’re problem. Trying fear monger people getting together all. People need human contact party 6 people isn’t super spreader event.

Fuck takes stupid. looks like cases nearly doubled past week. get, thing really stopping actions people (mask-wearing, social distancing...) restrictions/some form lockdown. Tough choices made. (Cries HIV/AIDS) Weird, can't figure numbers keep going up. hoax hospitals getting full enough ICUs?

Yeah, basically. seen concrete people like statements, end anytime soon. second wave come first come end

This result media brainwashing. personally responsible pandemic. Neither anyone thinks like me. Go blame China/your local government want explain deaths New York beginning pandemic?

I know say you, year much deadlier year 2018. IFR going down, positive PCR tests going up, deaths staying same.

The US actually upward trend yearly deaths per 100k inhabitants, 2010 799.5 yearly deaths per 100k, 2018 867.8.

This year set break trend, really, amount people dying month increase January, 20k less people died 2018.

If mean possible many people died spring early summer, answer : gov. Andrew Cuomo retirement home policy. Also I'd blame tens millions unemployment claims collapse economy, subsequent social isolation.

It pretty shitty flu season, panic really media hype look numbers.

Source : U.S. CDC. evidence support claim? qualified individuals research back up? sound like dick, kinda sound like dick. seen doctors YouTube said natural infection recovery usually provides robust immunity even best vaccines. idea that's true, anyone know they're implying agree? Vaccines aren’t enough own. population vaccinated + masks public places + stadiums closed longer + work home workers + COVID-19 rapid tests travellers entering country denial entry positives, enough stop community spread entirely. guys plan let spread get herd immunity?

If everyone gets it, 1% death rate, that's 3,000,000 deaths, 3 million Mr fake PhD throwing papers around doesn’t even understand lmfao worst days covid infection resting heart rate 120 - 140, sometimes spiked minutes 160 Moving goalposts Yep quarantined couple weeks also. bit vitamin X works IL updater process counting totals weeks now. take now. It’s okay. true, data September. last months even worse countries bottom.

EDIT: Missing word early Christmas parties !!!! WOOOOO Like dark magic, leaves .... traces. Fuck. 

Okay maybe worth looking at. actual data points have?

The NYC serology pretty questionable scientifically, think ended around 25%. testing done knowledge. 

There's dialysis study, 9% nationwide. really well thought of, look state state numbers seem inconsistent impossible (it implies around 3% IFR Colorado like 0.5% New York state). And, done ""summer wave"".

If broke deaths spring summer could guess 1.2% IFR spring 0.6% summer. could good sanity check, guesses. 

Is nothing else judge from? *You're* not. Everyone else is. Stop acting like boss everyone disagrees you. thought called ""epidemiologists ""? state, Ohio, law enforcement officers exempt mask mandate acting law enforcement capacity. wish officers wear masks, Governor listed plausible reasons LEOs could wear masks constantly, interactions hearing impaired individuals, etc. 

It sounds like sheriff stopping officers wearing masks, required certain situations. PTO individuals tested positive COVID must stay home.  Im saying right, uncommon. kinda understand people marshalling motorsport free (near cars, social etc), dammed im going that. fucking petty wish people would miserable worked it. Lazy cunt  think link broken, can't help think referring me. 

Who got ""message""? El Paso Police Department still enforcing it. Sheriff, County Officer, sided County. big surprise. Literally nothing changed. County Judge still unsuccessful getting compliance City El Paso departments, answer City Manager/Council. Valid point sure without even looking article. Man, agree prediction. feel like time it’s gonna MUCH WORSE... **FTA:**

*Someone leaked daily reports NPR, found reports could be, could still useful public health experts.*

*That data daily reports contain focused hospital's capacity treat COVID-19 patients. include things like availability hospital beds, ICU capacity, ventilator use. help track changes pandemic-driven healthcare needs real time; example, NPR notes ICU bed occupancy increased 15 percent past month, tracking steady rise positive tests (although probably soon track current surge cases). weekly summaries would allow coarse look pandemic stressing hospital system, they're probably coarse provide sort detailed analysis researchers public health officials need study understand COVID-19's progression.*

*So get access daily reports? According NPR, circulation limited ""a dozen government staffers HHS agencies."" single member White House Coronavirus Task Force, Admiral Brett Giroir, appears get material. Oddly, would seem indicate Dr. Birx, spearheaded changes due desire data, direct access it.* could easily it... randomly check people, like surprise parole visits. they’re home, straight jail, five figure fine. throw buck o' five will?  ones still open. Seriously, hard find them.. BLM protest. everyone wearing mask what's fucking big deal. Ok? say people start desiring go European county instead. Much better chance bot treated like trash one best ""shut fuck up"" responses I've seen here. Yes,i drink milk like water lmao NYPD, expectations probably high. Maybe beat couple cram many possible jail together without PPE.  ... what? US 100k new cases single day? Unbelievable Cops gotta start handing tickets. also gotta start wearing masks themselves..... 99.99% survival governors praising thousands people protesting. I’m going that’s ok. He’s done remarkable job considering pushback he’s received. hope enough fighting public health orders get pushed up. shouldn’t political. president made political making mask-wearing sign weakness.. sign caring well others. important thing Victoria's efforts probably go way softer attempts get job done. There's lot places staring terrible situations enough stop getting worse. worst ones pediatrics burn victims. nearly vomited mask transporting morgue.  doubt it. really opened eyes lot problems society. I'm trying positive though -- think end going teach seek bring positive, inclusive individuals life. also given opportunity help at-risk people nobody else could.. would. tiring trying, end I'm going make lemonade lemons.

I convinced us see way times without giving putting heads sand come stronger persons.

Keep head up. We'll pull through.  looking face, I'd say prenatal doubt chronic alcohol abuse helping any. Also, name Kevin. Sounds like stopped able pay rent due losing job due pandemic exactly reason moratorium put place, sheltered redditors gonna judgmental think fearmongering since realistic scenario truth. comments deserve lot upvotes why: Things terrible US already. Getting worse every day. Even shift government post election, take long time new policies implemented obvious reasons subtle ones.
Additionally, judge make political statement, U.S. turmoil bc covid, impact whole world. Please misunderstand, think loss life country terrible tragedy people died loved ones care matter. get attention deserve. 
However, impact profound leading world nation devastated covid. 
This far I'm typically pessimist. Hang on, OP Canada! 
And thanks post. May get this, regardless &lt;3 Listen buddy. aint pulling nothing ass kind cum blaster close by. telling like archievement, meanwhile taking demand away private labs put everything line manufacture oxford's vaccine. 
Argentine politics big dick measuring contest public private, except pay public costs fail buy private companies anyway. went neighborhood. hour kids really small groups, part looked like siblings parents. table patio premade candy bags laid kids grab one move on. Everything went well mob least 25 kids parents came street like plague, masks anywhere, completely wiped everything had. watched go street turn passed, everyone's lights went Halloween hour still left trick treat.

Only takes couple people ruin everyone. think immune-compromised individuals wearing on. We're hearing anything vaccines causing immunity, hearing 3-6 months antibodies that's folks normal immunes systems. Would risk it? Naw, cultist spewing propaganda. switch messages told cult leader. Logic use decide go cult personality. hate fucking subreddit obviously don’t hate snitches lol QUOR future bright, need get winter. Second wave also toughest Spanish flu, pretty much died winter 1918-1919. without vaccines. People dislike word herd immunity even 20-25% it'll give enough protection make much easier live virus without harsh restrictions. Thanksgiving weeks away focus election campaign, perfect storm coming. pretty. commenter, sympathize. Apartment dweller semi-urban/suburban area. stuff I'd normally either closed fucked. Trying buy house bit time/space hobbies have, fucked housing market picky girlfriend (of 7 years, legitimate consideration, I'm going dump move quicker lol). gym, hockey, even starting get quite cold. I'd love 'just go back living normally', I'm also going break gym, can't force hockey league change nonsense new rules. outside observer, see possibilities partial national lockdown weak national lockdown full national lockdown USA.

We see example national lockdown usually ordered highest ranking political leaders/executive branch like President, Prime Minster etc reasonably applied America sitting president currently touch reality implement policy, even going far listing ending COVID 19 pandemic part accomplishments President.

Next, even Joe Biden becomes President, situation calls its, states authorities might recognize this, party politics, disbelieve science based approach belief cure worse letting disease run course etc state authorities.

Even Joe Biden manage pass national lockdown, states/regions might even ignore it. seen current mask mandates states, police sheriff departments publicly announced support it. enforceable measures, proper lockdown. Leading weak lockdown. like US gov would never anything like - lie public months beginning serious was... didn’t want alarm everyone. No... would never ever happen. People think they're smarter experts and/or can't bare minimum stop spread virus end keeping rest us able get back damn lives. shit like happen everyone stayed away wore goddam masks 6 months ago we'd back normal now. would awkward hire job work hours week weekend, temporarily pandemic spike passes that.  right mind would hop cruise ship anytime soon? Taking things context meaningless. However, almost year, people still unwilling know facts. I'd say lack capability understand it. attempt explain would complete waste time. stand corrected apologies, number quoting indeed global number  didn’t really shut travel China. Basically, thousands Chinese got flying Chinese territories US. Plus, pathetic screening efforts follow confirm people abiding 14 day quarantine guidelines. 

There plenty articles documenting toothless ineffective so-called China ban was. 

Here’s one. whole Americans stupid that’s blame pandemic narrative getting tiresome

Oh we’re sorry you’re tired true statement. Whatever shall do? 

Imagine tiring I’m still fucking house able go anywhere Americans stupid follow instructions?

I think I’ll tired instead. ring every second day two half days outside bedroom windows choice politicians? capable understanding opinion people’s opinions subjective? I’m saying isn’t easy catch Covid, surrounded someone extended period time isn’t guarantee catch it. could try willful denial like US doing. diabetes isnt contagious dumb f*ck people think already happen New York places? Melbourne, Australia, one would receive $5000 fine real them. something happens people. catch bad flu we're reacting.

Its hard get people never, ever seriously ill lives understand fucking horrible serious respiratory illness much think wishing could breathe normally.

Some people going die. Others going permanent complications. true. YES! need need now. Put national guard peoples doors to. You’re tiny human brain assuming virus spreads everyone. You’re forgetting K value virus explains people super spreaders responsible large spreading events.

Is hygiene? way breathe? knows? rude right now, talking about? intention message me? Again, still want feel worse, right? want feel better? want feel? act matter much? gain interaction? this? Barely - advised shut weeks ago made continuous missteps every turn. Best luck anyway. Fucking east village right thing friend wrong thing wedding middle fucking pandemic?! FAKE NEWS. 300,000 dead Americans didn’t sway opinions, 30 second ad won’t make difference. one people going visible reported media. People right things anything report. 

It's hard time keep trying best. last forever even seems like sometimes. Ah utah county, many people damnedest ensure NONE us nice things. coworker working positive responsible.

People wearing masks improperly responsible.

Shit, sensitivity really fluctuates quite bit. Things could little worse considerably worse, depending (un)lucky are. 

Thanks sharing article, exactly looking 👌 standards, arbitrary decision WHO. Hence, they're responsible slow response.

I think response H1N1 already slow, understandable given pickup spread severity slow. COVID different serious enough China shut one major cities, deploy field hospitals augment overrun hospitals.  slovakia counts deaths differently. mistaken, belgium counts even ""covid like"" deaths, slovakia counts deaths CAUSED pneumonia covid19. dead people covid19 died, directly covid related pneumonia, number.

During evening mask compliance better. still 75%. done, maintained, North America right political will.

No, virus spread far gone America thing Victoria. Also keep mind one city harsh restrictions, rest country (federal governement) provided finacial support. That's bit different entire US going lockdown. said people care beyond advanced morality. guess that's trick? shit ton people unemployed unable book trips. lot people dropped middle class returning may turn difficult. stats that?

That's bold assumption, lol. false positives false negatives depend stage infection we're testing next weekend.  That's much easier all, lmao. Thousands bussiness Melbourne went bankrupt. understand argument hard lockdowns better longterm soft lockdowns, let's completely jump shark here. pandemic global, unless every country gets control always problem. countries realizing faster others there’s point stopping this. This, 100%. Well, even small rise temperatures increases physiological stress bats, leads higher viral excretion. also cause nutritional stress, food water become scarce (hotter air even shown decrease ability find food echolocating bats), plus kinds environmental stress. make abandon natural habitats search food shelter elsewhere, could mean increased contact species could serve intermediate hosts viruses humans directly. 

Global warming (even slight temperature changes) concerning already visible impacts ecosystems, ultimately major pervasive, leading kinds nasty issues us species planet. It’s quite possible that, wasn’t climate change, sars-cov-2 zoonotic diseases wouldn’t spilled humans way recent years.

Billionaire gets sick, seriously cares ? hear you, believe masks general remedy risky behavior. know masks efficient filtering others, one control long they're worn for. country (Switzerland) thought could allow major sports events thousands people stadium everyone wearing mask. Nope. Case numbers exploded despite masks.

Imho masks used make necessary activities like shopping groceries little safer. guarantee safety people keep crowding together, shouting speaking loudly, never change masks etc... OK, agree extent. never advocated lockdown. issue term ""lockdown"" imprecise usage conversations. good day. Well I'm glad everyone northern hemisphere got covid numbers zero 6 months ago then. good, Sundays usually lower count. feeling week going wild ride. Apparently 77 people fined since March, 7 charged. news, water wet. It’s really weird tradition aside seems like really bad idea kids go around everyone’s house touching things dirty hands. might well give virus spray guns. 1200 jobs lost day nothing compared US's figures. every time feel happy number days without local transmission counter resets 0 next day  irony probably get upset people don’t follow science.

Masks work rates pretending silver bullet think focus Whitehouse? whole fucking county exact way.  they? sources? really going pretend travel restrictions reduce transmission covid19? ScoMo: we'll see that.

*Insults Beijing absolutely reason*. Jack's raging respiratory infection. England it’s..... it’s easily reproducible. Well Mumbai lot folks dying Heart attacks dont get tested post mortem covid. 

I suspect India deaths understated due misclassification. 

It would much better real time statistics made available sadly neither quality quantity data coming India good. Hmmm people wearing masks, people believing science, people selfish morons... Guess really helps pandemic. Blame dummies still figured trying let everyone die town COMPLETELY reckless family too! earths immune system can’t seem kill us properly It'll simply change date people losing lives due Covid.

And, loss life country acceptable sense word. par say Germany could analyse situation conclude done bad job, we're nowhere near level happened country really acceptable. Hopefully. depends effective media continue pushing propaganda mind control idea advocating lifting restrictions don’t care 230,000 deaths incredibly dishonest. would prevented deaths? Close country earlier? Even initial Chinese travel ban opposition: down” country earlier? would massive civil unrest confusion, one advocating types policies. 

The bottom line deaths unavoidable without 20/20 hindsight total ban air travel.

The virus community. either advocate people high risk take reasonable precautions, continue shoot foot, run entire country ground ruin society everyone. highly immunocompromised person (just transplant, high doses everything, causing lots problems) say lock us up. 


Sweden gdp sank 8.3% quarter. IIRC that's pretty part countries. Australia 7% dip, USA 9% dip. Great, let party. People sub stupid neckbeards social life. Sweet!

It signed TT recently assume that. 

I accept award behalf of.....myself. thought washing mail groceries unnecessary since transmitted surfaces. add switzerland disastet No, anything specific, nothing would find google search. remember reading days ago. Doctors nurses good lie detectors. ;) Source title? sub sucks. getting votes simply stating fact matter virus never 100% eradicated. point dug one gives flying fuck China.  China dictate pandemic policy countries.  China responsible decisions leaders countries.  China responsible ignorant fucks like spreading misinformation literally killing people.  assure pandemic consequences misinformation campaign. problems lot times events cause spreading. Wow. They'll lie. Australians, permanent residents immediate relatives

Except 25% total cap consisting arent categories business investment visas. (Thats 1500 week) - thats case since caps started. 300 week talent visas (thats musicians tom hanks et al)

And 15K foreign farm workers announced 2 weeks ago, including couple hundred already flown in.

And international students, already commenced. wonder everyone keen social distancing here. isolate normal times anyways 3 days! Even nothing else, flatting curve month big deal saves lives preventing overloading hospitals. hâte titles, ofc cases surging death toll hits record high. Whistleblower when? Yes 100% right.  People going poor, depressed unable get medical treatment need covid19.  Good fucking job owning yourself. now, was.

The reason here, again, second time; opened enough people took due care. And, experience tells us third time.

There's difficult choice coming: either employ draconian measures force people better 'cherish freedoms' accept significant chunk population simply care inevitably go 'round circles opening up/restrictions/lock complete associated ever increasing loss life/businesses/jobs/community organisations on. confused deaths via bombs. Dude shut world causing go kooky get type mental issues. Go walk. Call friends. gardening. Visit grocery store buy something like. It’s okay. Don’t panic. shut call make clearly damage psyche. Wow. stupid I'm sure explain England Wales, Belgium Netherlands. relatively accurate. Stop lying. crap needs fucking illegal. Iran undercounting factor 3 earlier year. Official numbers low compared Europe's April surge.I wonder still holds. Lockdowns meant bring transmission rates 0%.  Jesus christ still talking entire fucking year? 300k fucking dead ""debate"" dead.  swear god absolutely fed people. call 300k per day end year. city hospitals overrun patients H1N1 outbreak, situation early China painted much serious picture. Early CFR near 10%, even it’s around 3% resolved cases, compared 0.05% H1N1.

The goal Vätterrundan next year, together oldest grandchild. Wait when? guys actually got EAS? notifications say? think access rapid, simple testing turning point. Vaccine development finishing touch. that's thing, people scared 100 euros fine willing take chance. wonder he's smoking? next summer German government still trying treat virus another political party negotiate compromise with. Best tree fiddy  example, user reported city (Berlin) offering everyone.

There shortage right people want it... poster even year.

Any year could get vaccinated. understand concerns point view. Whether go forward expanded access EUA, hope something happens soon.

Also shitton people summer one wanted go sea. Yup. Transmission fomites slim. primarily airborne. 

Masks protect people, offer slight protection wearer. 

Hand hygiene still important, furiously disinfecting groceries mail necessary. Fuck restrictions Fuck Fauci. tired living Communist China. 

These lockdowns never made civilized world. 

The politicians instituted tried Hague. 

Everyone supported them- ashamed enabling tyrants control fear. infected mean lower spread, means virus there, surely - doesnt become factor limiting spread :( situation Netherlands, riot police got summoned fined like half partiers. think fines 100 euros though, unfortunately interesting thing didn’t realize AstraZenica vaccine refrigerated using dry ice, -89 Celsius. administered hospitals, facilities store vaccine.

I thought Pfizer. 

I also thought often case that’s temperature verified, might able go warmer don’t know yet. find vaccine isn’t coming years is, would distributed 70+yr olds actual tangible risk...

They’re going waste dose 23yr old redditor germaphobe shits giggles. ## Facts. General advice, regulations laws

**A general advice** binding way law regulation. Anyone violates general advice therefore punished.

This mean optional follow advice. general councils well-developed referred relevant authorities, means general councils quickly become law.

**Regulations are** binding rules status law.

The Swedish Public Health Agency has, example, issued regulation stating businesses Sweden visitors must take measures reduce spread infection.

But regulation also contain general advice. clarifications comply regulation.

**Recommendations** linked rules way general advice. based science best available knowledge, Swedish Public Health Agency writes website.

**Restrictions prohibitions** issued support of, among things, law regulation.

Keep going back friend normal flu deaths still significant though, much US/Canada disparity nowhere near COVID's  Japan enters chat... Why? still dont understand subs obsession fucking childrens future ""listen science"" btw. arent ever going eliminate virus fuck would close schools, arent even driving force spread wearing mask since March (except occasional times), never got infected either lazy Americans selfish. That's message trying emphasize. Got it. US #1 deaths per capita whereas France #7.  People saying worse true hate US.  fact people complaining pandemic response know capable better better. know, right? Reddit LOVES hating America. I'm scared. work warehouse, tons guys wear masks wrong wear masks all. Management enforcing mask mandate (it's also company policy? except company policy wear working others. constantly). sweaty hard work communication going yelling since loud. I'm scared I'm going get one talking party plans Halloween, drinking partying friends (though drink party friends almost every weekend.)

I've best. go out, shop groceries week fewer people store, wash hands thoroughly often constantly itch dry, sanitize workspace. tell people get personal space way often feel to. use microwaves work, eat lunch outside car days.

I can't quit job, source income. I'm scared know do. want get maimed killed give anyone else. really thought getting shit together year. 

I can't find specific info state websites facilities positive cases spread concentrated except names nursing homes. know job 2 3 people gone recently Covid building shift. tested negative time get tested months ago.

This fucking stupid. feel like I'm waiting around get sick, get shit wrecked get thrown away like piece used toilet paper. 

What supposed do? source data, albeit old, simply claim ""I think x"" really dispute anything fucking bummed never sequel!! It’s exceptionally rare multiple studies making even clearer get twice anomaly. Thanks way! reading post: open world map check Liberia El Paso. friends calling dumb coming Halloween party. ""It shit"" said pray time gets sorted vaccine released. Source telly? Ok Mr. 10M. Fool.com ... Sounds right second wave Spanish Flu said caused people celebrating numbers going down, helped spread virus faster further. roommate's great grandfather died pneumonia ""THE flu"" almost year supposidly gone. remind whenever seems start getting Covid fatigue. Yes dare people post countries live in.  see anyone US trying chase foreigners threads. BREAKING: Cat's blisters hurt bad anymore, decides jump boiling plate again. you’re fucked Numbers lie political agenda.  US objectively handling pandemic worse countries deaths/infections per capita bear out. It’s pretty human. People, especially young people, want social. also bad weighing cost actions aren’t immediately apparent. Maybe getting sick maybe getting people sick illness *might* kill kind problem brains well designed anticipate. Young brains aren’t fully formed, young people even less capable making best decisions kind situations.

Social modeling also matters lot. susceptible influenced behavior around us would probably like admit. America, lot mixed signals circling around seriousness pandemic. issue made partisan President party. made conflicting signals even profound. many people including powerful leaders engaging pandemic casual even nihilistic way, unsurprising many people underestimating danger COVID-19. 

It also unsurprising combine problems current culture valuing individualism self aggrandizement all, Americans less concerned duty fellow citizens. sense duty would help balance human desire social explore. values charity, honor, fidelity, kindness, gratitude, self-discipline, cooperationtion tend conflict individualism self-aggrandizement. Belgium, congrats guys !  Could agree more. need way effectively punishing people abuse freedoms badly put risk. Deaths infections per capita higher US France.  excuse Trump administration's lack pandemic response whether #1 cases deaths #100.

Your dear leader murderous traitor. So....fears wane cases mortality wax?

This flies face normal logic. Fears wane.

Results differ. favor read whatever book/news article/magazine found ever CEO Gary Kelly announced Thursday company would begin selling middle seats beginning Dec. 1. company, along handful airlines, blocked sales certain seats order promote social distancing due pandemic slow spread coronavirus air travel. Totally agree Ok basically here's highlights.

She promised 16000 affordable houses built ~600 were. Also housing crisis spiralled control rents skyrocketed.

There light railway planned built Auckland due completion 2021, started... also Auckland people paying special tax go towards programs used that.

She promised free university boost tertiary education follow expansion left first year only. tertiary enrollment fell.

Ardern gave child poverty portfolio personally managed poverty especially child poverty got worse 6 9 indicators deteriorating including important ones.

She promised make transformational progress climate change carbon emissions policies enacted take effect climate change late.

She said would make NZ equitable income wealth inequality ballooned rates unseen since 2007.

All Ardern done stumble crisis crisis gaining popularity handing adequately. Hello? already flu levels. missed statistics since February? source observation working healthcare 🤷‍♂️ take word guess news enough though... Otherwise moved right pandemic... want get please.

The trials exist reason - attempt identify sorts rare adverse Can't remember last time flu shot killed anyone.

You search CDC's [Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting Looks like 503 total reported cases symptom ""death"" associated flu shots data. (Note necessarily mean deaths directly cause shot. Flu vaccines still good idea, even weakest ones estimated save around 61k people per year.)

Masks really much carriers wearing mask. Good, cant wait Kinda true tbh. know far evidence shows get virus again...right? safe. Regardless. I’m glad I’m seeing easier you. 👌 America literally self imploding point. Communists? World war 3? Terrorists plotting bring america freedoms? Nope, US gonna fall of. ... virus. Similar population size Scotland. Sigh. Thanks responding. think right. rate people remaining symptoms (altered smell taste, breathing issues) recovery also low? curious seen stats roughly agree, countries (at least talk Spain, live) big hole mask wearing: indoor bars restaurants. People compliant general, take mask eat that's clear risk scenario.

Maybe even closing indoor bars restaurants enough, know. think France Belgium already done recently guess see. Spain unfortunately strong resistance closing them, they're quite large part economy, that's part doom pandemic. [The Anti-America, licking America's boot.

That's disguestingly narcissistic. use antibodies test instead testing virus? wife sick week (fever, severe muscle cramps, lost sense smell, cough, though) coworkers got pneumonia time got symptoms.

Around covid test costs 5 times antibodies test, wonder take instead? think? care.  pedantic spread misinformation. Smallpox coronavirus? Jesus. That's size Texas There’s things. Yes lot factory work here, call centers warehouses. lot El Pasoans also work oil fields week come home weekends. 

We also can’t really shutdown border here. Many us work, go school care family side border. Juarez sister city 1.5 million people alone. 

On top numbers people see El Pasoans. patients three separate Texas counties two New Mexico counties. top also Ft Bliss. ran hospital room long actual city did. base never went lock lax policies regarding treat civilian workers led entire family hospitalizations. base biggest problem right even spread city really started from. 

Also Hispanic culture making worse. Family gatherings big thing also working even sick. Many people go work sick lose everything. There’s whole bunch factors go Jesus fucking christ...

Enough bullshit already.  Excess deaths prove this. Well, us, top human right right live. guess America freedom die however want. that's choice, would judge. obesity numbers far lower. live protesty/rioty city entire country. numbers low. happening there, trust me. least worse current generation, least countries. Yup, completely stupid insult completely adequate description. admiral getting access information general public.? put far many loved ones ofrenda year. mean article unbiased, think false? hard everyone right now. days literally remember pandemic fucked financially. days forget cause spend hours gaming I'm working time days get work I've set working 12 hour days like 10days row wanna go beer bar friends can't. lost car, huge job opportunities, much more. Idk long keep isolated lifestyle longer everyone whole that's keeps going really. Marks mandatory public spaces France. Covid 19 cases still skyrocketing 170k Nonsense. He's translating article google translate tries pretend FHMs bureaucratic 12 point ""recommendation"" system relevant. 

He's unbiased all. He's extremely biased thinks ""avoiding public transit, malls physical contact"" something different recommendation stay home. He's extremely biased tries pretend ""totally lockdown"" ""only recommendation"". 

Just typical misinformation coming Tegnellists. fat one honestly first rational comment I’ve read here. feel like comments sub turning witch-hunt point, assuming everyone goes crowd either stupid evil. honesty simplest explanation young people watched country fail respond right way, watched leaders stop giving shit, depressed cooped 7 months, watched south Midwest west coast issues just. Done. don’t agree choices, isn’t big mystery either- think know going party risk. don’t care it’s risk anymore, America’s leadership incompetent leaders publicly states there’s way control virus anymore. It’s sad situation, is. Infections don’t matter. 

That’s like caring got sniffles. get infected live cares?

The majority deaths quite early on. death rate gone up. 

You panic monger. Privacy. Yes get tested. 14 day period prior getting symptoms could contagious, last contact within period. 


However feeling covid related symptoms point, there's good chance it. Best option still get tested quarantine receive results. Regardless outcome, still got two months current Administration. Based track record, safe say see national lockdown time soon. Also think we'll ever see national lockdown - we're large, there's lot resistance, spread uniform across country. Dr. Obvious Well point isolate- unlike actual covid positive people breaking isolation Melbourne caused outbreak needed locked . Thats point. Everyone isolate, avoided lockdown. Nope, 24 hundreds millions another way prove rare is. 

I never said wasn’t possible reinfected, said exceptionally rare cited study. 

YOU banned, four posts removed low quality info (lies). 

You lost.  Poor partygoers. Well, worry. try sneakier next Halloween, I'm sure Coronavirus still thing, thanks people like them.  job go back too. really keeping mt fingers crossed good stage 3 results well, first time I've seen figure expected efficacy. source 75%, please? I'd love read something maintains hopes up. little bro never said can’t get reinfected I’m saying it’s beyond rare. know I’m right citation, yes! actually try edit reference include link good wiki karma :D Thanks sharing it. show what? deadly most? get medical care, symptoms mild self-isolated home. Quite nice ""home"" actually still private hospital. link wikipedia article work. working link article describing 1936 accident: went day got 2 boxes 20+ masks. 

Casually. use. Perfect enemy good.

I get dichotomy people present must throw arms air, go lick every stranger.

OK, likely many mental health complaints extroverts merely pouting, lack neuroticism definition. Fine. Go masked something safe. Go find activity need. Go form bubble lick much want.

But licking strangers menu. no, virus give contour histrionics, happened every point peoples lives. satellite images used bomb remaining survivors. 0.01% percent mean 24 reinfected hundreds million cases, means 1 10.000.

You pointing study proved reinfection claiming proves cannot reinfected. 

You banned sub. Except hundreds thousands taking rushed vaccine. also chance slip way look break neck toilet. Yeah, that's family is. 3 people bubble (2 households, one 2 people shoebox apartment). take precautions, wash hands, wear masks, social distance go basically groceries take drive car. Separately, mean. could still get it. grocery store, elevator. possible, make us bad people. Sup. It’s another 8 days, still “house fire” estimation. I’m disgusted hysterical covid reporting gets fade background.

Take care. long would willing selfless hero?

And, point, long would someone demand everyone else? 

Fine want play martyr. Leave rest us choose alone. dad tested positive virus started feeling symptoms October 29th. last came contact October 25th. go get tested fine? haven’t showed symptoms, wake congestion sore throat that’s sleep dog allergic haven’t taking allergy medication. Ok u/IsThisGretasRevenge Obviously shit decision morons, fuck me, NY seems like good time :/ Source: Florida. check rally Miami tonight. claim cannot reinfected.

You back claim cannot reinfected, single study Qatar although study proved reinfection. 

You deserter making whatever excuses deserting misusing report button. Exactly! Either lock hard pull Sweden. R0 = 2.5 masks reduce 80%, mean R0 = 0.5 (so person average infects 0.5 person).

Why numbers going down, even people wearing masks?

Infections halve, grow. ask further? test do, nasal swab test? Cos everywhere see says results take 24 hours more. 

And travel Europe says within 48 hours arrival. I'm wondering go this.  COVID honestly I’m scared hell, virus hits seriously LoL type 'does vaccine prime immune system' Google. First result CDC. literally copied word word. That's test community, catch early enough testing anyone feels unwell stamp without lockdowns. hanging always group, chance catch spread disease lower several groups dynamic group. case get infected, everybody called isolate. Little risk lol. Spreading death others lol.

Big selfish vibes don’t understand. people SD concerned? It’s fine. outside masks. dead Pfizer vaccine likely get approved US third week month. Nothing going speed process. think AstraZeneca vaccine likely another month that. Moderna approved in-between. Johnson &amp; Johnson ready New Years Day, Novavax likely get UK approval time, US approval January.

All timelines could get derailed adverse events (such already happened AstraZeneca J &amp; J), currently track five vaccines widescale approvals end January.

The small silver lining current high number cases US Europe vaccine makers know earlier vaccines work. government supports them. Quite countries, including Australia, paid part wage bill businesses keep employees economy ready kick again. NZ successful economy going well quite companies paying wage subsidy back government. Traveling medical professional here. consider travel and/or finding better hospital work for. sounds like needs go bankrupt taken better system. 

A lot large hospital systems suck too; HCA, Trinity, Circle Health name I've worked at. Sometimes hospital shitty system awesome though, need take risk find forever home!  100 eu party?

I've paid more, sign up.

/s ofcourse wait 5 minutes tested. kosice. smooth uncomplicated Government *never* give life back hand them. Makes even lazier complacent scared population need nothing about. uncivil downvoters.

Earlier wrote that, this. Rule #1 subreddit ""be civil"", please refrain comments like this. antibody test less reliable wait till recovered.

Is my-nose-is-blocked loss smell i-should-be-smelling-something loss smell?

Anyway symptoms severe, stay home. ¢¢ wondering number seemed incredibly low. Fucking crazy, though. right, see much logistics whole operation. I've seen army trucks highway even Saturday evening, easy task.  PCR tests, accuracy rough topic

This something understand. method 90% correct - can't apply three times 99,9% regarding safety testing (massess, lines)

This looked really terrible TV news. explicitly recommends avoid crowding giving person slot getting phone number contact delay. guess nothing sort done Slovakia? leftist east village dont give shit virus anymore, nobody does.  still get EP pension though. wish people would say every time every programmed response ""*we KNOW*"" came up. 

We also know asteroid going hit planet destroy us all, can't shape lives around idea *might*. mistress told change ir “Quarantine Peace”  allow protesters/rioters gather thousands close streets loot? Why? Could worse, could better Unfortunately live there. Dr Atlas, like many Trump’s orbit, fucking idiot Congrats, know mellenials felt time.

You mean badly spelled down-voted nugget get butthurt behalf demographic blithe, fatuous inter-generational outburst? I've using word ""vaporware"" describe vaccine months.

I'm glad people starting get realization. Right enough support people quite bit longer though. really isn’t choice Lmao Humans brains evolved deal even process global scale problems. We're designed small village living, megacities &amp; social media take time adjust can't hard train millions unemployed EU this. 

You also whole countries once. could regions close ones tested ones haven't.

So many ways come mind mass testing whole populations could achieved covid anymore. are, sure service already somewhere.

Problem someone still foot bill. fed states able. machines need fight behalf. Risk assessment would conclude keeping you, somebody self-serving would turn species order ensure survival, around would come risks effort worth.

The short is: machine AI sophisticated see SciFi movies made enemy humanity, attempt appeasement would meaningless. need you, continued existence could lead problems future. logical course action termination. country lot pain winter. many selfish assholes. No, people travel land sneak disease border. Also, USA much bigger port Australia NZ. Like football..... People wearing masks supposed wearing them. That's problem. one trip store looking pictures parties tell that.

Almost 100k people confirmed day extreme alarming? become point you? Ok Cypher Well also able read exceptions, both. Native speakers come learning easier, it’s still frustrating. Oh yes, current generation masterful job. 🙄 happens, get little better, worse, little better, worse ever. Often multiple hospitalizations. don’t wish death anyone hope grandfather find peace. Actually, Russia bad part it. There\`s free test doctor state-owned hospital prescribes one, he/she testing everything else (for reason). 

They supposed visit test home, called hospital, told ""don\`t drive crazy, loss smell happens time, wear mask come see doctor here"". 

My hunch there\`s order keep numbers low, would test it\`s really-really needed often time (I heard) wouldn\`t disclose results.

Obv, get tested private clinic, don\`t keep secrets:)

I don\`t care much, though. Treatment would (test test) pretty much - stay home drink water, still need paperwork get mine. sick days mask gives bit time presuming positive person wears mask too. honestly think catch flu past two years chronic pain anxiety could never sit long. Drove daughter nuts. anxious hour eating looking somewhat brilliant. Get get out. two hour restaurant dates. Specifically, USA. cops almost NEVER wear masks. Walk street consistently ones mask around chin. BLM protests, didn’t see single one mask. Even coverage breaking orthodox protests seen wearing correctly. 

You feel bad exposed, helping kindness others either. think virus arrived US caravan? I'll leave medical professionals decide would best treatment. could imagine developing fitness would make less likely need respirator first place. Since think obvious headline article. applies England. 

The last paragraph restrictions apply England. parts U.K. govern public health measures, Wales Northern Ireland already effectively lockdown Scotland set tough regional restrictions. eradication COVID literally impossible.

Absolute non-sense. Covid 19 magic. follows set rules. Humans ( proven many countries) using knowledge tools like testing, contact tracing, distancing masks, virus cut off. try that, we’d live 1 year lockdown least destroy humanity set us back couple hundred years, thousand years.

Again absolute non-sense fear-mongering.

 Countries Covid 19 control, need tighten increase testing contact tracing efforts education campaign sanitary measures continues months. 

 Countries control outbreaks must take necessary steps bring r sufficiently 1 long enough number new cases fall capacity contact tracing. contact trace harder ever.

DO long enough localities become Covid free outside intrusions sterile zones minimized.

By eradication complete.

Even cases remained, contact tracing hard testing keep control.

Coronavirus magic. know beat it. Also, disease returned them, even it’s isolation, means it’s longer eradicated.

This key deception. think eradication ""perfect"" worth doing. epidemic, perfect enemy good. hope society come compassion vulnerable. Arguments ""this worse"" flu, point society come accept influence kills thousands every year. flu negatively impacts health care economy affects us. here's hoping see silver lining seize opportunity better. That’s exaggeration, can’t deny 1 year lockdowns set us back lot years. Lol - report saying get reinfected, exactly think except rampant misuse report button? 

Just clear, sited study claimed proved reinfection 1 10.000, RARE enough you, claim reinfection 24 millions.

You parroting think logic is, actually using it. know document cases reinfection, every individual infected would full strain analysis several times people get that. anybody ever got reinfected strain, would impossible scientific study actually prove all. also know infected once, many individuals become careful infected (even someone Qatar deliberately exposed 10.000 people virus second time order study reinfection rates).

It proven know virus fluids spine brains without throat nose. proven know salivary glands serve reservoir virus would cleared antibodies places body, antibody reactions goes salivary glands, would otherwise cause inflammation reaction time eat. 

You report telling modders reddit forum much like. know informing about, good chance modders know either. 

If notice it, care show links saying, give free education service. 

I simply informing basic established facts, fact coronas neuroinvasive. 

Neuroinvasive virus hang evade detection nervous system ages. Like measles reactivate someone age 90 bodies weakened. 

You clearly care feel inside. claim cannot reinfected, report saying get reinfected, claim reinfected something. 

I honestly care invented victory, think try make interested understanding things knowing things stop using people's scientific studies conclude studies proven. 

Remember nobody yet proven specific virus ever leaves body infected. 

Scientists tell longer detect virus certain degree recovery *prove* virus longer inside human host anywhere, every single person got exposed virus would autopsied tissue individually sampled traces virus. 

So science tell longer possible scientists detect virus you. 

Nobody ever scientifically proven neuroinvasive coronavirus left body exposure. 

You prefer conclude free sars2 virus longer detected tests. proving stuff works, inventing conclusion based science managed tell you. 

If want appear logical individual, try making feel okay ""the unknown"". 

You reporting warning trying warn unknowns making invented conclusions unknowns science unable explain you. 

So remember, scientifically, cannot find virus still *in* you, unless kill sample every single part tissue, one millimetre time. 

What *can* say, longer possible prove carry virus. make comfortable fact life full unknowns. okay knowing things, makes scientists capable inventing conclusions try harder follow example. pointing science inventing conclusions left right makes seem like completely fail understand science parroting means feel like something wanted feel. 

Idc organism feel right now, care let guard believing can't spread transmission people. 

Have nice day. Well, China larger population. fact is, hard lockdowns work. caused lockdown genius. fuck call American? quite recall? College students going college things. 3 one day high records row case counts 30+% positive. Kim Reynolds busy helping Ernst campaign even hold press conference fits definition lockdown, call lockdown. probably call Sweden back May lockdown well? that, we’d live 1 year lockdown least destroy humanity set us back couple hundred years, thousand years.

A couple hundred? THOUSAND years?

BAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA holy shit, needed good laugh. Again, NZ Australia islands. France USA aren’t islands widespread uncontrolled spread virus. Even ones moving around would less 5% population moving. Look countries hard lockdown followed strong testing. Way obvious ""We everything right. didnt know could get bad"" totally understand them. lock downs , restrictions ... life needs go . person Melbourne say codswallop you. Imagine defending cops lol. guys probably gassing beating civilians June Week def Aussie Iam def American. might hypocrisy also fact....  too, we’re getting close. wait see happens. understand endless speculation. far endurance runner. run 5k. think maybe genetics something. think probably generally effective first release vaccines are. Typically, trial data known small review board even business leaders know data conclusion reached preserve independence prevent bias leaks preliminary data think jobkeeper ends March see real damage.  Uh huh 20c lol

Studies show viruses transmit better temps 6c 

20 LMAO suggestion never leave continent. isnt meant dig American testing numbers crazy me. Sydney, Aus 25k day like 5 cases reported day. course pay people work. US pay people work. aint seen anything yet, thats sad fact, wave hospitalizations STARTING Several comments coming mere seconds posted. ignorant apparently speed readers lengthy articles. going even harder ask people maintain social distancing wear masks vaccine. seems like preventing symptoms infections mean much undetected spread. find discouraging. IME, lot nurses first clue they're talking about. New York Times says 74,000 new cases November 1, yet another new record. 100,000 confirmed cases, plausible many unconfirmed cases. Oh yeah. working postal service, need something like this. would thought could need shipping stuff around citizens around country.

This ridiculous hoarding ineffective ventilators aroud place effective measure would reduce infection rate. convinced amount bicycle riding justifies subjecting 81 year old mechanical ventilation CPR covid19 related respiratory failure. title like throw excellent ignorant comments. I've sitting week looking US Halloween plans thinking ""you guys Halloween?"" mean always pretty low key UK year absolutely dead quite rightly middle pandemic. never even saw tacky shit shops outside pumpkins themed sweets. requires government intervention supply stimulus support people whilst isolate, issue...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* body double are! Everyone well moment I’m thankful for. Thank well wishes well :) enforced isolation +ve cases.

Obviously 5 prongs equally important, feel like one particular illustrates big cultural difference.

In Korea (for example), told need quarantine, mean it. test positive, stay hospital 2 weeks. Even test negative, symptoms self-isolate home install app phone tracks location, turn internet/gps even second get panicked phone call asking turn back again. co-operate prosecuted, potentially held liable government economic impact negligence.

If UK implemented measures people would lose minds would protests ""erosion freedoms"". Instead we're basically told ""if symptoms pretty please stay home 2 weeks 🤷‍♂️"". don’t speak everyone. low-mid income people lose money due lockdowns wages frozen/reduced due furlough. Also, businesses lose lot money this. working, many people like working, it’s money. figured make money without working, we’d done probably COVID. IHME model scary. prediction end January 2250 daily death, best case scenario 1340, worst case scenario 6000 daily deaths. past week, number confirmed cases raised faster originally projected, I'm worried. nations higher daily new cases, namely Belgium, France UK, already took lockdown measures. think US government going coordinated plan next two months matter way election goes. solution requires cooperation majority, better come new solution. Yes see 20 c lmao. 29 tomorrow ever cope? people want isolation complain isolation already place use argue return-to-normal. Dude, apparently 50% Americans expecting way tooo much Jesus. dunno tell you.

We've become super dumb country. predict years, research point mask misuse (or lack use) largest reason UK's relatively poor covid figures. base purely anecdotal evidence. Ireland's cases going cause different set restrictions put place weeks ago everything still practically open, effects current lockdown seen another week so. history many countries going war put harsh restrictions freedom, violence, ultimately returned freedoms without violence. DONT KNOW MIDDLE PANDEMIC!!! would German pay Eastern EU medical bills

Germany would pay supplies test kits keep eastern Europeans traveling German testing hell Poland decline offer?

You tell me. definitely think we'll consider going forward.  Thanks PCR tests accurate enough days exposure, would know infected.

Being exposed equal infected. remember reading somewhere sitting across infected person 15 minutes masks ~25% chance transmission. hope find strain deadly maybe 3 weeks. Every time stories like come out, people always complaining, ""Why people SELFISH!?!? EMPATHY?!?! everybody care themselves?""

Maybe that's world live in. Sorry, r/coronavirus, exception, rule. know like think live fantasy world everybody cares fellow man, happening. Frankly, *never* norm. Deal pretty ironic see error 451 used GDPR GDPR legislation protecting personal freedom. 

That said, ready let benefit doubt assume local newspaper data stealing vampire legal team ensure worldwide compliance Sad....everyone NY forgotten deaths earlier year. Liberty sanity. I'm trying find clarification travelling ""through"" New York. example New England way PA. Also, talk interstate commerce? Garbage. people taking tons precautions still getting sick.  Right!? ThEy'Ve lEaRneD lEsSoN Yes, people are. friend friday invite dinner group friends. told no, covid. friend close friend test positive. People fucking stupid. Anecdotally, I'm already aware MDs looking applying work visas Aus they're tired fighting something government(s) nothing help.

Feel sorry health workers there. severity second wave attributed circumstances First World War.[81] civilian life, natural selection favors mild strain. get ill stay home, mildly ill continue lives, preferentially spreading mild strain. trenches, natural selection reversed. Soldiers mild strain stayed were, severely ill sent crowded trains crowded field hospitals, spreading deadlier tweets get posted here. Ugh, sick BNO tweets. True, manner Africa might handling pandemic seems speak set circumstances present pandemic's outset upon continent, rather innovations wider world remains unaware of. cases record specific scenario impossible trace. Thats refer community spread. Untraceable cases.

Viral load matter, different delivery systems high viral load. One prolonged contact, another high instant exposure. Walking sneeze cloud safe spend 15 minutes there. Community effort discourage hospitalization might though. No. make immune long all. People going get sick sick vaccine not. stop it? 2 cents:

* Encourage 3rd world countries less kids. Less population, lead less need expand wild forests/areas.
* Encourage 1st/2nd world countries stop/reduce consumption meat. Brazil raising rain forest make room cattle.
* Pandemic surcharge Air Travel, reduce air travel increasing funding pandemic/virus research. Slow potential outbreak even little.
* Set Airport Public Transport sites monitor fevers. Requires IR cameras willingness pull people sick.
* Encourage culture wearing masks, start flu season. 

* Move production PPE China locations continent.

* Abandon handshakes cheek kissing way greet other.


Anyways, 2 cents. ""hygeine"" what's spreading virus here. lesson? Get warmer climate? new. It’s study variant competed variants.

It isn’t settled fact D614G different strain, another piece reported new?

Because new study. language like May, science replete “weasel” words order avoid overselling findings. everyone share. want part COVID19 vaccine. many friends family members medical profession ranging technicians doctors nurses tell take every death every case severe complications personally. amount trauma going COVID insane. family friend who's nurse almost 30 years ... seen patients die due COVID last 8 months causes death entire decades combined. takes huge emotional toll. ""on record"" generation would done same. (Cuz wasn’t everyone, some.) Lots people do/did stupid sh!t young. think private enterprise working testing. know private- public partnerships. :) good thing info thing constantly changes new evidence comes about. race baiting trying pick fight anyone even ""called racists"" playing weird victim card. Ok, could’ve done then, little late. Difficult trace back disease it’s widespread. Protests ended several months ago, spike happened like 2 weeks ago. Blaming individuals basically natural disaster good mental health. one causing pandemic wearing mask outside. ""two weeks"" everyone locked wore mask, tried around world worked blindly downvoted recently read npr piece said much. Schools almost entirely uncorrelated spread. I'm sorry lost baby, may family moments peace today. quite normal yet us family friends beyond 25km regional Vic, looking forward Sun 11.59pm :).

That said awesome go restaurant today. last time Feb 29. 

Hopefully long interstate travel too. Unfortunately think people family overseas waiting long time :( Interesting article doesn’t really say world learn. Bump, wave, ripple, ridge, kazoo-fart, three ups downsies US. mean better prepare happening going *just six months* every six months actually anything many Asian cities, San Francisco's numbers would considered major outbreak. Wait telling claim BLM debunked already guys wrong mean evidence would love sources.  Partially only, another lockdown half schools still stay open... sure enough! 2x number UK lockdown, would didn’t lockdown now? NZ lots factors helped eradicate disease

Most countries factors too. reason contact tracing, lockdown early shutdown international land borders closed US air travel drastically reduced along bans regions hardest hit early on. telling US contained outbreak much better? going even harder ask people maintain social distancing wear masks vaccine.

That's eased slowly noticeably, would enough many. Try perhaps limit masking crowded and/or indoor areas cut distancing bit. newsbreak.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Isn’t transmission outdoors pretty low everything stop virus China didn’t keep getting out. would say that’s failure cut transmission rates, that’s even better.

I think reducing amount virus replicating body cuts though it? infecting nasal cavity enough infectious? There's also prosecutorial discretion (procecutors take cases, regardless evidence grand jury says). 

The theory behind many laws broken frequently, could never expect police procecutors keep up. Even Hawaii enforceable.. kind insane over-regulation literally people buying fake tests travel. Bunch using there's multiple professional services specifically regulations like don’t enough fingers toes count number times fauci wrong virus people pandemic over? distributed vaccine willing take it, realistically? suggesting wear masks social distance indefinitely? point allow things reopen (even stuff like music festivals). specified initial post least Europe woken danger listened scientists. Sadly long way :-/  Yep, worrying well. People seem understand we're going wearing masks, restricted capacity stores, restaurants, public events, etc least another 10 months so.

Also, considerable share population get vaccinated? don’t test countries like test here. Plus dr fauci disaster wrong virus many times flip flopped telling people many times. spent 40 years position it’s time go would wear mask trails? pretty dumb. city streets seems like good precaution. Also, Nevada seems 60/40 masks indoors. Stop fucking traveling potential vector. No, much not. article makes sound bureaucratic. hard anonymize data protect privacy allowing people see overall numbers trends. Please see comment Vietnam source speculating?


It’s obvious soldiers would sent back home country trench warfare flu, case, able provide sources. hard stay away people care yet carriers covid-19 potentially infect them. irresponsibility means death vulnerable people. havent even read article commenting, you? depends age distribution, bit conservative.  joke buying things store manual version amazon's automated shopping. retail cost plus mixing 1 person live must outside 2 apart Fears WANE? What? Cases time high December likely even worse. Community effort discourages testing stop hospitalisation cases surging though. thought stupid BLM protestors pack together think Trump rallies dumb getting together.  Well maybe Keto problem then?

It proven numerous studies harmful diet doubt also increase risk COVID complications. Maybe. There's famous island nation Vietnam too. Great. reopen. would amazing, brought solution table instead bitching like little girl. ""professionals"" every pub across country. even people paying attention attention whore. solution, please explain, otherwise shut stop bitching, helping anyone. bet voters people vote reality shows. *shrug emoji Logistic* curve want precisely they? That's promise since lockdowns shifted ""flattening curve"" eradication. ""Do X there's vaccine"" justified. really should, bad backup often needed people refuse abide measures much less restrictive. realize it’s interactions like driving spread virus, right? know spread inside school vs outside could possibly know propaganda ? 
And disinformation ? maybe let people form herd immunity? Damned damned don’t. Guess could use refresher they’re everywhere. mods need ban comment goes medical protective measures suggested, Pretty much.


They think they're ""tough."" think morality change hospitals country overwhelmed? really get acknowledge overburden cities earlier inn year dismiss sane situation several cities later year.

The intense localized springtime situation inn New York required extra freezer trailers mass grave. Back benefit medical staff traveling parts country. situation staff burned overloaded. worries, I’m speaking myself. don’t mind wearing mask. CSU alumni, surprised animals Boulder shit like this. Trust fund babies usually think consequences apply them. expert, doubtful viral load works way. case, anyone low viral load (ie asymptomatic people) could never transmit serious case covid have. 


If saying true, anyone worried room someone low viral load still infected, could never get higher viral load them. Yeah, seatbelt thing, stupidity chance select gene pool.

With mask thing, stupidity chance select people gene pool. even need two forces... dumb even understand could get weaker. now? Take money billionaires pay people stay home would better *Every* country different combination geography, culture, trade, etc. That's flimsy-as-fuck excuse one richest nations earth way warning coming almost anyone else. 

Our lockdowns achieve goals all, needed use time sit thumbs (and plenty people refused even that). lockdowns meant give us time get systems contact tracing, supplies, testing... lagged everything. 

""Nothing could done!"" cry neglected done, want pretend choice. Underlying conditions? Nah exactly thinking. sue school enforcing “no bare asses” policy? work authoritarian countries large nationalized governments. can’t United States. also worry, long term ramifications allowing large government control lives. 

Is temporary safety worth giving personal freedoms likely forever? Thank edited source.

That good source, doesn’t support contention Soldiers sick sent back home, trains whatever mode transportation.
This helped deadlier version virus spread.

Rather, supply uninfected troops trenches allowed virulent strains selected for. Maybe can’t tell difference, literally opposite position. Shipping sick soldiers didn’t enable spread, shipping fresh soldiers rather allowed virulence soldiers trenches became sick, military evacuated front lines replaced healthy men. process continuously brought virus contact new hosts—young, healthy soldiers could adapt, reproduce, become extremely virulent without danger burning out.

Anyway thank source. brother tragically died accident 2 months ago. come home funeral. I've trying book flight back home since keeps getting cancelled. Earliest flight back February. nothing, eradication destruction. Harm reduction thing, know lot people think way 95 people dead way better 100 people dead. actually matters grey areas live in, like reducing infections deaths. matter wins election day reaction citizens bad. Paired already problematic time country multiple ways. Lol

Not disagree, happen. Corrct, might want change DHS HHS. Yeah, nuh uh. think may still need regional lockdowns based hospital capacity, happen point. “Biggest global education emergency history” 

That’s exaggeration joke. idea “global education” recent one isn’t even consistent around world anyway. certainly know exactly lack government regulated education look like, modern schools recent development.  ""Mom, age me? Could get sick die too?""

""What? Sorry baby, mommy go work we'll lose health insurance.""

Fuck trump, fuck gop, fuck every single one republican followers caused enabled situation. least US there's massive political pressure undercount, yeah, course there's undercounting. wrong... Corrupt immoral.... difference. Whataboutism serve anyone. mass protests good idea pandemic? course not.

Is mass rallies like election campaign good idea pandemic? Hard no. That's former went away due aggressive testing contact tracing - got stopped tracks cases could start popping everywhere - latter burned own. Obviously, none case COVID-19! Ok, people free. Freedom fighters. talking Ireland, UK both? live I'm basing answers numbers. nice thought... consider many aholes hired him. Think it’s Hawaii We've done lockdown before, we're one right (in UK). China, Victoria, NZ, Israel done lockdowns. Guess what? sky falling in!  don’t mind wearing mask indefinitely high risk situations

Indefinitely? thanks. Mask protect much anyway. close, mask caught it. ability imagine living someone else's life seems pretty limited. 

I assume underprivileged family living urban food desert, then, ability get decent education limited ability buy fresh foods. pretty cocksure know easy life them, simple would they'd pull bootstraps. think worth it. Testing mask wearing rather quarantine. Otherwise traveling abroad going happen Covid going away... Vaccines likely short lived that's even manage create one... young person high risk, really hate stupid fucks quite lot.  Well, add fucking list guess. paying attention last 4 years? issss watch Fox News 2 minutes without barfing overt lies propaganda?

Serious question. topic usually one thing. It’s isolation failure also masking failure, social distancing failure, forcing people back public spaces digital solutions. 

It’s literally everything people act like it’s 2019 again. Stop shunning science smart. Yeah, also lockdown society flu. Although, there's foot door, surprised people demanding lockdowns flu. people learn hard way. I’ve saying beginning...don’t expect vaccine. yet develop vaccine coronavirus, notable attempts SARS-COV-1 (SARS 2003) MERS 2012. Granted considerable amount resources thrown SARS-COV-2 might possible, think putting WAY much faith vaccine. course virus discriminate.
It presents risk infection spreading.

The reason someone takes risk makes decision less dumb. agree? (And please spare ""everybody's individual values valid nonsense)


But reasoning ""you guys chance set consistent example blew it"" (therefore yolo) - takes cake.  lose pension. Even someone like McCabe fired cause still end pension. Rest Peace young man. don’t feed kid prepackaged snacks :/ don’t know what’s it. sugar eats fresh fruit, that’s it. doesn’t get cake, cookies, chips, ice cream, lollies, none that. Obviously next one lives like this, people think insides more. Seriously. first thought saw kid was, “no kidding”. kind adult/parent lets kid get size 13? considered abuse. They’re likely inhibiting child ever semblance normal, healthy life. suppose case entirely, since poor kid passed away. :( Polio close. 

Did dreamt heard registered zero new cases summer people got 2020 might last one ? would amazing news true We’re communist China literally lock it’s citizens apartment buildings. USA large country, vast population many differing opinions. One side always disagree, regardless issue. 

I get you’re saying think strategy work Island nations, easier time locking borders.

Either way, point economic damage another large lockdown, would devastate US economy worlds. Many reports that’s starvation going global time highs this. many ramifications. like go HARD shit like Halloween honestly whenever... Late 20's still urge college fucking crazy night bars house party.

For Halloween year total 6 people place made homemade pizza, drank, played board games.... I've never Halloween like feel like anyone can. fuck can't chill 1 year go banger party pandemic. Take heed? could stopped pandemic summer wanted to. bit much effort keep focus another couple months wasted hard work Spring. sorry. feel same. 2020 broken ways never thought possible. Tomorrow 47th birthday. Sigh COVID-19 death defined surveillance purposes death resulting clinically compatible illness probable confirmed COVID-19 case, unless clear alternative cause death cannot related COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma).

Did even read posted started moaning Busses ? he's already lost. he's beaten man walking I’ll getting new friends soon there’s vaccine I'm poster lol think Americans dont want Covid go away. Vaccines always promoted ""end"" pandemic. think people going calmly accept goal posts shifting ""well actually need wait second third generation vaccines reopen, social distance 2023 2024,"" delusional. People barely complying is, they're going keep vaccine out. look picture...? Yeah basically agree this. Right basically unified message, see ""figure yourself, own"" Pence spinned it, ""we trust American people make good choices families.""

Basically message. Everyone defers Facebook feed then, tries make sense world way know how. guidance. There's different kinds parenting styles leaders parenting style children. *Absent.* people refusing wear masks think right keep piece fabric important hundreds thousands businesses closing half assed measures minimal compliance. nuked spring, today. 

People refusing wear masks keeping economy trash, responsible much higher death count per person. ""tips"" goes beyond previous advices, like says, ""sustainable Swedish strategy"" people touted 7-8 months working. going need bigger boat. Trump says Fauci ""...wrong lot."" Trump wrong pretty much EVERYTHING anyone needs firing Trump. 1 month hard core government funded stay home would significantly reduce case load. Letting us get back almost normal.

Except significant proportion people would absolutely obey it. 

They'd take cheque, buy new TV, invite load people round come watch get drunk.

They give stimulus payments food vouchers credits household bills such. Government employees rarely fired, I'm sure dig it, none current administration ""fired"" would technically terminated. demoted crap resign. Yes, elimination. Region region, country country. tight border controls 'green' 'red' zones. Lockdowns aggressive TTI red zones get green. Open borders green zones.

East Asia made good start this. Yeah that's right, economy cratering, millions jobs disappeared could years return all, deaths dispair way up, pretty much everything everyday life people enjoyed involve looking screen table we're bored lol ok. people denied medical care get covid. believe science, fine, believe laws, fine, believe reality, fine die alone gasping air beliefs. lol. nah. Yeah that's right, economy cratering, millions jobs disappeared could years return all, deaths dispair way up, pretty much everything everyday life people enjoyed involve looking screen table we're bored lol ok. Yup, 9 eleven two day. need panic, folks. grandmas grandpas dyin folk drain econome. Sacificez must made. biden become president? push others towards Trump. It’s going get much worse guys it’s going get better.   Loser cops, let people party! Yeah, slow don’t crush hospitals.

And

Wear masks reduce dangerous dose innocuous dose. Yeah, well America going fire Trump tomorrow. Self isolation period 14 days. PHE include people 28 days. Also requires knowing you’ve got COVID self isolate, asymptomatic rate still high. two adopted children. adopted infants. One thin rail one obese. raised same. Please stop blaming poor parents child. case counts record highs, yet many states like Idaho embracing let-it-ride approach. One county hospital nearing capacity repealed mask mandate. 1. Closer equator. 

2. population adapted particular latitude. 

3. Society still spends far time outside sun West. 

Still falling line Vitamin hypothesis like Africa. still contained one country time. expanding green zone. couple reasons. First, don’t eliminate travel contact people, reduce contact transmission. mind, costs pretty high. governments rushed issue lockdowns stay home orders, CFR 3.4% IFR estimated 1.4%. Testing countries nonexistent. Hospitals overwhelmed idea treat virus. conditions, risks lockdowns worth it. 

We know lot covid now. We’ve driven IFR down. We’ve done partially increasing testing we’re increasing people asking isolate and/or quarantine. makes sense move test, isolate, trace approach. 

We need combination safety measures like masks social distancing, well restrictions large gatherings events nature. 

Think like sex. Let’s assume we’re trying prevent pregnancy. Lockdowns effective abstinence education. Yeah, staying home contact effective, it’s also practical. need something effective combination birth control condoms. Think testing/isolating/tracing birth control masks/distancing/gathering restrictions condoms. two, working tandem, allow us get vaccine available. 

Unfortunately, live Florida none happening I’ll go around mask, give money businesses enforce mask rules, hope best. people responsible would’ve May.

There ""being this"" vaccines out. remember people sub pointing Europe getting back normal early summer... Welp, seems like they're all. 

It's simple, think ""out it"", start getting back normalish, numbers go back up... [archive link anyone trouble accessing article 1 25? like odds. really wanna read this, paywalled :( I'm afraid it. Nobody going stay locked vaccine out. vaccine always promoted ""end"" pandemic, think people going accept ""well actually, keep social distancing third second generation vaccines,"" delusional. incumbent upon at-risk populations take health hands point, can't really ask vast majority people continue putting lives hold they're vaccinated. is. people disagree land whales can’t stop eating junk. 


Calories minus Calories Out. That’s folks Things may played bit differently, look Europe right see US's fate would even rosiest realistic timeline without Trump. Blaming everything pretending we'd prefect otherwise delusional. New Zealand comparable, island isolate itself. Australia comparable, anywhere close amount travel cities. South Korea comparable, tiny island (for intents purposes travel N S) completely different culture. keep going. also hard compare strategies. South Korea size Newfoundland (just island). much easier National mandates make sense applicable everyone.

Nationally, plans needed. Provincially, need applied right time. every province (or state) different timelines. biggest problem Canada much interprovincial travel. whoever said humans inherently cooperative needs study collective response pandemic. heart scarring overwhelmingly common side effect covid. happens expect shave atleast decade off. pair coginitive effects death 1 many undesirable outcomes. doesnt even mention physical side effects. 

Flattening curve great prevent mass loss life doesnt protect me, individual, alls said done. Ill keep hermit get vaccine avoid less ideal ououtcomes value length quality life. Yeah amazed people claim ignorance.

People notoriously bad self reporting. understand vectors transmission.

It takes ONE weak link infect whole family.

People also lie others.

How many people met express utter AMAZEMENT they're still obese claim exercise eat healthy?

Yeah.

Results lie. That’s use emergency powers ban sale general public simultaneously. twins born June. fine us able go things like classes library museums early lives obviously. time they're one, way. Sorry. Im going let kids live normal life. also means seeing mom dad mask every time go anywhere inside home. CYA lawsuits maybe. 

That's looks like me.

No one wants take responsibility actual death panel deciding gets care left die.

By getting state give thumbs up, re-direct blame. people brains thought themselves. Really. actually thought would couple months? true all. Japanese people go around wearing n95s p100s rates stayed low. Nope. public figures making announcements. Countries well COVID quick-acting, smart, invasive, somewhat authoritarian governments. west suffer many freedoms, bulky governments good distributing money (but much else), citizenry lacks empathy becoming increasingly distrustful science. doubt mind Asia become center power 21st century, seeing why. tutored kids math - far ahead American kids, incredible. Lockdowns without appropriate economic stimulus doomed fail rightfully hated. US, majority households much spare $500 emergencies pandemic. Obviously things gotten better since then. part normal life. Hundreds thousands young healthy Kiwis stuck abroad, basically refugees foreign nation now. definite negative impact vs small chance impacted virus really cause issues among young healthy. hope things sanitized completely new people sat them.  stopped/contained much worse outbreak NYC much larger population. Honestly know scarier. 
Trump reelected people continue stand despite everything. talking ego moment. kid someone feelings would sing different tune. I'm trying wrap head around us/eu comparisons. 

A lot people pointing europe second wave compared us, problem us never even got first wave first place.

So that's got wondering things gonna keep getting worse even vaccine developed couple months, especially since many Americans even take it. Federal government didn’t want close borders, temperature screen airports recommended masks? 

The federal response worst like April. It’s like Americans say it’s unfair compare success island nations’ responses USA’s response... USA’s response includes Hawaii ... didn’t work well either. people told needed undertake measures ""to flatten curve,"" later would need keep undertaking measures vaccine. anyone power *genuinely* surprised they're expecting vaccine let return normal? number went huge percentage population weather got warmer. Looking death rates likely 20% population infected. No. isn’t likely all. 

Remember WORST case scenario 2.2 million nothing done. 

Worst case. perhaps making people need go multiple sources data means continue obfuscate it. Especially data central collocated place.

When election prospects hinge efficacy disease. last thing want accurate data showing fact ""bad"". I'm man. exhausting. would almost rather catch fucking virus live like another year.

I miss friends. Kid: \*lives unhealthy lifestyle\*

Kid: \*dies health issues\*

Its proven times times obesity weakens immune system, know body cant make proper immunity corona, obese certainly doesnt help Nightingale hospitals useful surge capacity short crisis - long term use.

Because NHS chronically understaffed times (made worse health workers sick due COVID) build new hospital - equipment place, still staff keep patients properly cared for.

Now, Nightingale hospitals would useful health service exceeding capacity risk collapse. point serve uses:

1. Morbid is, stop patients dying street/at home. Westminster acutely aware bad things got North Italy least wanted stop cameras seeing situation capacity exceeded.
2. crisis situation *could* stretch staff further. People would getting level care used NHS, 1 nurse 4-8 people preferable none *would* saved lives - beds + oxygen place beforehand helps that.
3. also utilise separate building COVID needed preserve routine emergency capacity main hospital sites. Under-staffing one reason yet utilised, possible option Gov next peak sustained long lasting. need ensure people confidence go hospital heart attack.
4. one area peaking much higher elsewhere, pre-positioned equipment resource place (oxygen, beds, ventilators) would mean healthcare workers elsewhere country could come hospital.

With regard last point especially - unfortunately 'waves' COVID far UK pretty much impacted once. densely populated country meaning regional variations still weeks away other. Obesity lack Vitamin D. really dislike rhetoric. ICU's become overwhelmed quickly, that's preventative proactive actions/measures likely beneficial. said, know people's anecdotes stating thing, I'm dismissing it, I'm wondering believe issue problem ""empty ICU's"". States open, almost everything accessible available people live lives see fit US.  


Sure, maybe argument could made April local state government put lockdown restrictions, like government level seems pushing ""unsafe"" go hospital narrative, actually quite contrary live. Elective surgeries open, Ohio, still busy. yes hospitals taken hit due pandemic, ironically speaks back profit health care systems, see statements laughable, even pointing finger fault? last time knew anyone getting diseases? get number thousand people year I'd say pretty damn good. year, sacrifice whole Spring forward. Let's hope next year. Happy November, btw. Yeah, many factors lead reemergence. Even Germany didn’t testicular fortitude finish task, although would better chance lived island. google recalcitrant meant, +1 fancy vocab. sound like someone lived land whale's life seen side. Yes, it. People willing sacrifice months lives cause. willing sacrifice year plus people 80s 90s live additional year. 

It sounds cold callous truth. I'm surprised downvoted mentioning China. sub weird infatuation China highly authoritative virus response. People seem want here.

Giving freedom slippery slope often get back.

Anyone else remember patriot act? Cutting hospitalization rates one thing, still need solid treatment plans, affordable healthcare, ideally affordable self testing kits paid sick leave actually get virus control.

Having space hospital matter people going tough use precious sick days, worse, lose money it. even worse, long term effects even understood. Lots cases people manageable symptoms weeks months, even contagious. think Victoria, Australia compares US? all? Population diversity, politics, economy?

There’s plenty democratic ran states, deep blue, don’t hold Covid. I’m living one. key remember electoral college statement pisses solidly states wins swing two that's matters seatbelts proven 100% effective wear one! /s shit. sure I'd predict 290million specific month.

200 million peak month, that's far likely.  Dude, cannot control virus. cannot contain nature. solution! compromises. 

The government protecting virus, how? hunkering 8 months sell aged kids sex? telling give guns allow reap absolute power *then* act big daddy centralized government requires permit even breathe?

The mask mother, like other. word put "" kids diet "" , see. Avoiding real issues here.  Exactly. dont know people think elderly want spend time completely isolated kids, grandkids, family... majority not. users spreading disinformation killing Americans Hitler did? Surely right bit angry people contribute deaths friends. It‘s exactly US Germany, every province it‘s way handling restrictions cases peaking came conclusion restrictions least outlined nation wide room adaptation provinces. People can't cook live food desert going start eating healthier meals. 

Picture living food desert, getting home 7 PM gonna get mcnuggets wash shit soda life sucks tomorrow better. propose person changes diet even ever change diet. 

Soda simplest, low-hanging way eliminate 300-500 calories day. Lol, okay then. Look, engaging good faith. evidence virus *not* carried back soldiers unique churn effect WWI contribute virus becoming deadly, etc, feel free provide agree. right nitpicking links provided arguing wrong know better. Ffs, even said 1918 pandemic difficult obviously can't real-time analyze it.

If find conversations frustrating like engaging 'lay people', bother. leave condescending, rude fuck comments get annoyed. speaking someone came privilege temporarily embarrassed financially. 

""Too ignorant"" result systemic lack education, think? Nutritional labels deliberately filled chemical names disguise different forms sugar put packaged foods.

You ignore body-brain connection. ""Eat less"" everything available loaded carbohydrates, sugars one dietary process away sugar. Sugar addictive substance. Poptarts loaded it. ""Bet can't eat one"" marketing line potato chips.

It may complicated much harder seem think. Again, appear speaking position privilege, even think are.

Saying someone ""too lazy"" moral judgement right make, quite frankly. Yeah different SARS. even mass benefit concert tens thousands people gathered together it, something can't happen days. tmz.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Totally. probably coming bit cocky point everything still speculative. numbers regarding efficacy change larger populations people sampled studied. leading candidates coming forth with, consistently sounds like they’re giving higher bars what’s required first interim analysis phase III results get emergency authorization

I also think come something that’s tad lower expected/hoped, tweaked line won’t take nearly long actually make vaccine, something remember well. Even ‘worst case’ happened something low 50%, next year could enough restart economy again, 50% reduction disease means hospitals longer overwhelmed deaths &amp; Johnson also really interesting candidate think keep eyes on. may end dark horse comes top! bit behind, candidate differs significant ways (one shot, complicated storage requirements.) haven’t quoted efficacy numbers executives put statements times want candidate “far exceed” 50% minimum requirement. think large scale testing going look interesting too. They’ve given minimum 60% goal samples going specifically target moderate serious symptoms covid-19, really Chances death way less 1% healthy folks. Unless restrictions push poverty/homelessness proven result worse health outcomes seeing US homeless population well. Dirtier living equals stronger immune system. Oh no, can’t go holiday stuck elsewhere - suffering! Okay probably sound weird. But. Get oculus quest 2 get multiplayer games like vr poker, pop1, dead buried 2, rec room, racket nx,vr chat maybe see close friends get one well. Hanging vr, weird sounds, pretty much like hanging real life. FEELS real even though cartoonish avatars. Friday night poker fest friends drinking laughing shooting shit feel spent night irl them. headset (well back oculus quest 1) back beginning lockdown positive would gone crazy. really helped friends cope able physically get together. addition irl friends made lifelong VR friends well. talked meeting yearly shit over. 75 parents live me. lung problems one O2. would kill got sick. left house anything walks old logging trail long since abandoned 15 minute drive house. I've never seen another person it. groceries delivered wash clean religiously. seen one parents 8 months so...I know like live like hermit, VR made bearable. FAAAAAAATTTTTT best guess Ministry Defence came (what would 100% be) 3.78 million. 

it isnt really possible say exact number, 10 65 told decide (or parents them), turned away testing stations, actually 100% participation also possible, people coming behind borders tested, commonly Hungary. people turned away either - potentially useful Slovakia whenever work visit often reasons. also literal communist state disappear people. Stop. make better Trump says LOT shit absolutely plans following on. People still chanting Hillary locked rallies. bringing students back?! close school least two weeks. ""Apples grow trees, get manufactured Bill Gates put 5G large intestines! Eating one day brainwashing liberal media! makes iphones? Apple! China! Apples red communism!"" International travel part “normal life”. It’s bonus. Ya I’m sure average Kiwi take able go Bali whatever hell want call unmitigated disaster America. mean clearly overwhelmingly approve governments response based election results. lot Kiwi friends.

People’s savings running America too. Hmm it’s almost like letting virus run rampant also economic consequences. New York 10000 cases per day April able bring number social distancing masks point 3rd lowest new case rate states. 

If federal government politicize virus wearing masks, numbers would much lower. Grandma basically said, years left, I'm spending quarantine. mid 80s tired this. good for? (Please read comment comment I’m replying to) rotten culture caused gluttony. watched boomer mom get fatter fatter. enjoyed eating entertainment, others go movies. really feel entitled “treat” ourselves, instead treating bodies correctly health. Many smaller people women need 1500 calories per day. started Boomers continues fat children. said remove people 65, children 10 people work foreign countries, additional 200k 300k could theoretically come. Better dying, living guilt killed family member. Sorry, rephrased that. PM isn’t fault everything, definitely fault much, implementing circuit-breaker earlier. 

He however aided fact British public large pretty apathetic whole situation concerning self-isolation precautionary measures. used student example something direct contact (I student myself. Missouri, yes agree Yes. Attack argument user please. cold af. Everyone get covid month rate think stopping going little tricky. IMO best efficient option right would vaccinate elderly high risk people. three vaccines full production. think world bank buy stockpile vaccine ship bulk around world ask 3 week shutdown following mass world wide inoculation week. 

The idea starve virus world wide one time. idea treat world like cancer patient. hitting virus multiple fronts time also removing food source. time data modeling, think strategy good chance success. not. credible reports happening anywhere social media presence seemed largely disinformation. yikes make grains chicken dirt cheap.

Have seen they've done chicken recent years? Cheap chicken part unhealthy food.

And rest said, think problem people time, grabbing prepared meals quick, manufactured snacks, getting addicted shit that's put and/or human's nature habit forming. makes sense. completely understand fomite transmission. Like covid + person sneezes groceries, think there's viral load, rather say picked apple non sneezed/coughed hand. Yeah... everyone said reactivation making people sick second time, right first documented case reinfection.

You know academics would get trashed like shit warn people risk dormant virus something evidence consistent. would called fear mongers would damage careers permanently. Sweden's case let infection spread society Nordics

How would prove assumption? Sweden consistently lower mobility throughout year compared Nordics (except maybe Finland) meaning measures effective longer time Sweden comparison. sound like “letting” infection spread me. covertly triaging going on, perhaps understanding palliative care enough, time proud hospitals could cope situation.

This accusation, established fact. important distinction. investigation reveal anything supports accusation though, bit bungling temp doctors breakdown communication far see. mean, fault people voted in.

These people straight mind controlled/too stupid fall conspiracy theories.

Then again, lefts fault fucking lazy comes voting time, they're majority refuse vote, America one worst places world voter turnout, makes sense. local police board, ones evicting people forceably. "" virus would still gain entry human body, vaccines stop replicating prevent symptoms, including life-threatening complications. ""

Like vaccines, words? Amazing news immunity front today. cell response antibodies detected 6 months infection, even among asymptomatic cases. fantastic PEI run Dennis King actually great job opinion. Cough ** Cough** ... 

So ? Maybe everybody get it, recover (hopefully) immune it. mild. Didn’t fever, cough, “only” lost taste smell week really sucked. know people haven’t able smell months contracting virus. you’re young, mild again, can’t sure. autoimmune disease thought sure it’d serious wasn’t. Imagine already bored sitting home virus isolate.... boring course want stay away everybody protect them. self isolate month neighbors don’t, first interaction you’d catch it. Either everyone time nobody it. something countries figured now. course it’s easy there’s plenty time prepare. health care workers know hard time getting social media families posting conspiracy theories, misinformation etc false

well comments section top posts possibly true

this daily sub perfect place type poat though...this taken bargainers get downvoted still dont think ok socialize Amen. Selfish c***s! Damn, can't copy paste I'm also blind. OK, way off, deleting :D pandemic cost saying masks dont help shit first started lol came press release WVU. post link there.

Source: live Germany beyond livid irresponsibily people behaved. gets determine “right cause” though? 99% back normal now. Look China, NZ, Australia, Vietnam Taiwan, mention countries like Korea it’s contained life fairly normal aside wearing masks restrictions.

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* friends Republican Democrat states everyone wearing masks. hear stories people small cases. like we're hearing cities reject mask wearing. else do? still know that. Everyone contradicting everyone. Hope true. hope Europe.

Don't worry, Switzerland logged pump numbers back part is. risk children very, low - enough effectively trivial (car accidents, drownings, etc deaths year would still kill order magnitude COVID infections 6-18 year olds even everyone age range infected). tragedies happen (such instance), kids issue. age range, actually true say flu deadlier (especially young children) COVID. 

The issue kids interact kids. interact parents, teachers, cousins, grandparents, on. children effective spreaders, would/will leave path potential death spread population stratas death rates higher. discussion needs around in-person schooling.  yes, say maskless many local business owners completely health, safety, economic stasis nation enforce mask mandate laid Governor Tony Evers.

To fair mask mandate designed allow bars restaurants stay open. exemptions people sitting bars tables, simply insane deliberately ignoring safety owners earn revenue. long bars restaurants open we're fucked. Whatever man. missing point whole lot suffering millions people lose jobs endless restrictions.

If vaccine end does? don’t even rely subjective difference. Objectively, greater adherence public safety protocols BLM protests. nobody brain things christmas. Stopping spread level controlled possible. Even vaccine won’t stop infections. won’t 100% effective, maybe even 40% 50% worst case. 9% Pasco county extremely high. 11% last Thursday. slowly rising spike suddenly jumped. indicates high community spread. concerning. reach 13% week, surprised. ----And shutdowns....so things get worse. Bad news sub luck, we're vaccinating monkeys now. They've shown better judgement hooomans anyway pandemic. Yay someone finally said Bartender here, confirm. quarantine told needed come back work, ready son high risk. told come back they'd fill position. refused collected unemployment went back. better judgement. GM give two-licks 10+ employees test positive. never even told us, aunt (who immunocompromised member country club) told cases. lit ass up. went little nuts get it. can't play peoples live way does. fired me, tried collect unemployment want go back work risk son. somehow blocked collecting. 


So I'm working different restaurant. One that's open general public. owners AMAZING. Family owned operated 30+ years. actually give shit. servers husband tested positive last week owner sympathetic- partner shut entire place 3 days, cleaned, sanitized fixed things up. Themselves. make us come it. Even though much risk us, said responsibility. server gets one full paid week off. time needs told would replaced job ready. ""Get well soon!"" we've started tip pool second week gone too. $5-10 every shift work 12 others. 


So good people exist. restaurant owners care. I've industry 12 years first time I've ever experienced this. many reasons vaccinations get 100% populations - refuse, know it, etc. get higher rate eventually, took long time get high rate example small pox. 

I also appreciate time taken discuss this. think would good many us look history vaccines really like them. bit dubious rushed vaccines this, however, like said huge portion population given - many trials people required government approval. please remember say ""has less chance flu killing me"" - might true definitely everyone. they’re thing 

No, aren’t know it. First, they’re completely different reasons, second, huge discrepancy masking adherence two. devil’s advocate

This isn’t shield spouting bullshit “both sides” nonsense. Still, checking specifics, seems difference staggering.

 care. Can't get cases zero. Covid 2100. long seeing mass deaths hospitalizations, need get Old Normal. 

Just hand-washing health-conscious. Yeah, glad curbside.  Saw ""essential worker"" wearing plastic shield set 2 inches away mouth, 2 inches tall. literally nothing. Also, food service workers wear masks noses chinstrap.

Like hell spreading it. 75% effective vaccine eradicates epidemic reproduction number R0 less 4. masks distancing measures, current R0 probably 1.5-2.5 range. 75% effective vaccine need. mean, rates insane might matter vulnerable target population getting exhausted. least conservatives actual conservatives, cutting spending gutting social services. opposed straight fascists. We're means perfect, even good matter, we're still America. dies healthcare collapse even mean?? seen number anywhere yet.  I'd take 3 million dead rather hellscape. exposed particles someone breathing second. not-well-ventillated indoor environments, builds hours hours cloud viral particles. store, aerosols floating air. constantly ensconced particles environment. Eh. Fair enough guess. hope seahawks go 16-0 without giving heart attack freaking last minute game deciding drives. watching hawks play dangerous cardiac health getting covid Thats...are u responding wrong comment? Sounds like different conversation. think many people interested ruining entire financial future months rent. panic lockdown. Follow herd immunity. High risk people always high risk, even post-pandemic. can't eliminate it, can't mask distance forever.

Also, high-risk people front line vaccinated, assuming get vaccine. Retailers offering like 6 weeks paid time off, paying quarantine, etc back March/April. realized going away time soon rolled back. Yeah, still look whole story. smaller state travel frequently populous states.

There people habits, density population, measures (mask, amount testing, etc...) considerations well (weather etc...).

Look south korea China, prime example ability contain virus even densely populated area. saw another post said South Korea A- Canada C, would agree. 

USA definitely E, means horrendous results pathetic. Guess lot funerals sick people. Probably long term effects. actions consequences. could well explanation One four? read somewhere two three! Evicting people pandemic makes absolutely sense whatsoever. 

If everyone refuses leave, I'm sure would help.

Organize, everyone gets evicted, go camp Governor's lawn. I'm sure 100,000 evicted angry people living front yard make think twice putting protections in. semantics know organization called criticizing, points significant lack familiarity subject discussing. 

If started commenting policies enacted USA Center Disease Management, would make sound like basic understanding I'm talking about. There's also huge difference outdoor protest almost everyone wears masks average Trump rally, many held indoors social distancing encouraging people wear masks.

Evidence clearly indicates BLM protests statistically significant covid spread Trump rallies linked thousands deaths already.  It’s mystery. know virus spreads. somehow doubt people whining reddit currently bankrupt.

There always going economic cost dealing virus, better response means less impact. solution bad response encourage even worse response pretend exist make situation worse. Rain responsible puddles, per new report It’s like restaurants, born it’s seen incredibly impolite best tip. It’s shitty system it’s like love it. It’s complicated. people getting tips ones fighting change tend pretty damn well. Honestly I’d prefer system like California make least minimum wage (which pretty decent state) tips still optional. wanna see people make enough money survive. workers often fight change current system. think Americans (if educated works many countries) would love switch something modern. Agree, wasnt disaster Sweden means. good spread around care homes that, good approach. zero benefits locking whole country long run. admit prescription exists idealized dream world? FWIW Slovakia 219 deaths far, majority deaths last weeks.

Thus crude estimate IFR approximately ~0.5%. people China tell people North East ""I warned you"". one handling well. Wait second third wave, we'll say ""I warned you"". mixture many things...bad food, bad water, stupidity, stubbornness mainly Americans think right whatever want regardless people's wishes.
The term:""Your freedom stops mine begins!"" article 1 large corporation America provide sick pay worker self-isolating positive Covid test? Color surprised.. Look down. See straps right boots? pull riiiiiight them. ask money parents start business. True. Europe entering 2nd wave much lower baseline North America. school teacher area continues rise, reason here. keeping open that’s parents rich area wants, superintendent said “it’s going great watching son playing basketball” back school meeting. Meanwhile two students’ guardian die last 2 weeks quarantined covid. teacher got breathing treatments every day class, head lunch lady hospital three weeks, still even discussing going remote. person 5 days week. personally around 7 people day tested positive, I’m discouraged getting test county school. going end well. even made point wrong about. said fucking thing show guy wrong.

Again, grow fuck. last two responses childishly pathetic. provide sentences realistic paths would stopped virus US post sure easy ask you. would given conversation meat see actually thought options realistic would really stopped virus. neutral news. would shocking able detect virus specific cells 6 months. still know nothing protective cells end being. road back

If vaccine significantly reduces death/severe illness, we're back normal within months. much hate saying get people going work sick refusing get tested right now, still get it. don’t get people throwing Halloween parties going right now. No. defined deaths hospitalizations. still see high case numbers coincide mass drop hospitalizations deaths...that pandemic over. link said odds false positive? think honestly depend live. FL restrictions right now, places like even looking ahead manner.

And sure, suppose lot businesses area could survive 80% capacity 2021, restrictions seriously loosened look much different past summer still close doors good. decent amount hope pro-science city enough people take vaccine see strong resemblance normalcy within next 8-12 months. perfect, enough social distancing restrictions continue destroy many small businesses. stratify risk visiting clinics right now?

Instead are. FREEDOM! YEAH! really think allowing 90% workforce 70% school opening going contain virus? basically travel anywhere self declaration work. joke.  course will, earliest start vaccinating vulnerable people probably February, receive 2 doses spaced gain proper immunity, whole process estimated take 6-9 months vaccinate 15% first world's population. whole world's manufacturing capacity 2 billion doses year, take 2023 vaccine enough people eradicate covid, looks like may repeat vaccination twice year several strands covid like flu. real question make enough progress weaken mitigate third wave fall 2021. 

This definitely long run, things like masks social distancing form another us years. thought 2020 bad things take bad turn, like vaccine effective enough every covid strand, needs repeated often ( vaccine gained immunity often weaker natural immunity gained catching covid surviving), somehow covid could mutate whole new form... might new virus creating another pandemic, rule one pandemic end order fir another one begin... new deadly flu virus forecasted years... bird flu pig flu... need mutate little might another spanish flu hands... matter time

 might years, spanish flu lasted 3 years herd immunity reached, lot people died, today prevented lockdowns, block reaching herd immunity, without proper vaccine could last decade multiple ways. lets hope made best vaccine yet. Given lack financial assistance businesses, individuals States, form strict lockdown pretty much cards right likely backfire. Literally nobody saying masks save day singlehandedly. Every precaution take means life otherwise little normal. Lockdowns like slamming brakes, masks part going fast first place. 

Masks social distancing wash damn hands go work sick... maybe talk getting handle without needing massive lockdown keep down. yeah, france includes non hospital deaths tuesdays fridays.

So given weekend effect tomorrow deaths likely much larger. last tuesday's figures twice last mondays figures tomorrow could near 1000........ assume infectivity directly related viral shedding, localizing infection means less viruses produced fewer exhaled result. would directly reduce spread r0 would drop due lowered infectivity contract it. **reach.** mask distance 2023 then.

And, no, doubt widespread. like everything else, bubble defines reality. I’m absolutely willing that, thank little.

Fauci describing lot vaccines work. ""immune""... get sick. Later vaccines necessarily work lot better.

The continued mask usage required allow time vaccines manufactured, distributed, actually administered. take months vaccinate millions people. still are! allowing Chinese scientists investigate origin virus. That’s like cops investigating I’m spamming. wasn’t one saying thermometers China. 
Good fixing it. country shut borders engage hard lockdown get control.

Whereas Midwestern church sees duty Christians help protect everything virtual (there limited social distanced visiting options cases lower, outside distanced masks). actually argued parts argument, may argue objectivity unobtainable ideal one reach. 

If collectively agree spread Virus needs stopped, restricting movement way quickest way so. 

Other, less individually restrictive methods exist, take time resources many weakest members society can‘t afford. name few: tests necessary chemicals, manpower, protective gear else time.  Ohh Missouri. bad Derrick Henry beast promising, reinfection worrying. get enough samples, someone able run bayes analysis find average length immunity. coronavirus immunity lasts year two anyways. 

Hopefully shot provide 1-2 years prophylaxis, we'll another yearly shot like flu, perhaps 1-2 years lucky. agree public health standpoint. But, think lot people miss government chant “write check”...the government print money. devalues currency. personally believe housing stock market essentially showing effects inflation (and moreso fact seen safest places stash cash rich.)

It’s complex, could chat economics. prob isn’t sub that. But, whole concept indefinitely print money pay people stay home...well, frankly implications global economy potential disaster something must weigh vs virus. 

It’s simple “can’t economy people dead.”

The rich SURE need paying more. Again, could go on, don’t wanna sound snooty. really elementary many people say “the govt needs give everyone money stay home”...well, sure, HOW? LONG? cut afford it? brain can’t wrap head around changes technology, human travel last 100 years. And, problem you’re saying. Weirdly enough demographics flipped Chicago. affluent suburbs parts city trick-or-treaters full shabang. wealthier areas demanding reopening places restaurants refused closed pitching fits. crock shit talking people likely jobs allow work home insisting everything reopen. mean Western culture cares life womb? posted pics Halloween party weekend. may small, saw 3 total people pics

Jeez, let live man. COVID-19 patients pass away, county investigate whether died coronavirus diseases.

Is sort politically motivated move, normal?

Also, data many people died diseases past years, easily compare to? Racist: person prejudiced antagonistic towards people basis membership particular racial ethnic group.

You wrong. today form day dead mix indigenous Aztec ritual Catholicism, brought region Spanish conquistadores. (Dia de los Muertos celebrated Saints Day Souls Day, minor holidays Catholic calendar.) 

Stop racist educate yourself: Angry Man Pub-party would bot change name often. UK here. Nope vast majority teachers wear them. Since common sense require scientific journal? need critical thinking, don’t expect everything spoonfed you. said that. comment implied children would likely die. point trying lockdown country viable.

The damage already done ball dropped.

Too many people unemployed damaged savings.

If people taken shit seriously months ago problem, 5-10% assholes dumbass politicians public figures worship turn pandemic joke. Quick question I've trying get wanted larger discussion. coronavirus survivors mild/asymptomatic experiences, side effects. reference, coronavirus February. Ik thats heresy two positive Abbot antibody tests interacted infected individual Wuhan. experience mild fever, wicked dry coughing fits, constant sore throat, loss smell, worst symptom fatigue. symptoms lasted 12-14 days. pretty bad fatigue two weeks afterwards. 19 year old overweight male time terribly risk. 

TLDR: Anyone mild/asymptomatic symptoms effects afterwards 'anyone disagrees child' USA basically 3rd world country

Reddit moment think want virus, it’s strange. Good rebuttal neighbor texted husband let us know they’re going quarantine 5 year old daughter “possibly close contact” confirmed positive case school, last interaction October 27. husband brief interaction said neighbor Saturday (October 31) outside unmasked, distance 8-10 feet. daughter also happened run husband said interaction. time probably less 10 minutes. Neighbor says currently everyone household asymptomatic don’t plan getting tested time.

What chances (hypothetically) husband worried? It’s still awfully hard get tested here, especially asymptomatic, plan quarantine next 14 days. 11.5 month old child I’m currently 13 weeks pregnant. anxiety already roof isn’t helping ☹️ one said that. would make exact argument getting vaccinations people. They've literally lost minds. Denial hell thing. people constantly arguing mask wear wear one taking precautions lower amount large gatherings. Yea could level New Zealand.

If actually took time money budget spot treat individual Covid outbreaks really put money testing could lock individual towns districts rather entire states.

We're point spot treat Covid. Let alone getting people wear mask small amount time they're around people.

Sure hell would lot cheaper catch early let spread. going cost us hell lot more. Yeah lot people needed work go shopping usual essentials short supply limited. 

This nuts international organization like talking world like systematic suspension basic human rights punishment trying keep homes maintain stability lives.

It's really time end lockdowns people extremely low risk hospitalization COVID. high risk groups self isolate herd immunity created among stronger groups. virus contagious, would never able prevent increases rates transmission current society. Increased transmission inevitable, lockdowns optional. scientific journal ""common sense"" published in? depends, really. really case EVERY one group cautious say? think riskiest behavior right indoors around random people without masks on. bars, restaurants, gyms, parties big nos. anyone group things? anyone group exposing (indoor maskless) anyone risky things? everyone group sees couple people outside said group occasionally indoors maskless, we're talking 30 40 people need accounting for.

 See gets bit complicated need basically sit really interrogate group exactly daily. there's always strong possibility even people lie, especially much they're actually exposing. I'm saying hermit next year, really answers either. there's guarantees anything truly mitigate risk much possible. Clearly does. Even USA, remote sparsely populated low population islands better big states tens millions people. Guam, America Samoa Hawaii. Would love hear arguments why. Anyone knows 400+ deaths hospital fatalities.? take angers much. Like know why??? purposefully ignoring data information Newsome allowing medical exemptions recourse liars! Californians say “I medical condition” longer applies. 

I’ve masked 45hr/week retail manager essential business entirety virus. June 22, 2020; anti-maskers California many reasons vaccinations get 100% populations - refuse

So ok risk people refuse young people selfish refuse? aren’t enough ICU med Surg nurses country meet fraction demand allowed spread.

I hate, HATE, idea socialized medicine, least countries incentive overwhelm healthcare system.

Here states leaders pass blame onto hospitals... much immunity vaccines roll around? mean, 100k infections day... Hey France, what's going on? Talk us. Stop nonsense! Canada checking in. knew effective government concerned well-being nation instead TV ratings could make difference public health crisis. /S overweight Oh, climate change now? Please stop. right, noticed months ago...people looking enough.

Part reason aware COVID first got rolling living Siem Reap, Cambodia...a town teeming Chinese tourists had, time, compunction sneezing right face.

We waiting get clobbered COVID. never happened. get sick second week January, many people reported longer average flu winter, may already hit anyone knew it.

More point, though...people talk amazing Vietnam's response was, etc., Cambodia virtually reported cases deaths verify government basically sh\*t. nothing special Cambodia handled belatedly putting country tourist ban, still case.

I've trying understand ever since, useful since helped weed lot paranoia bad reporting that's fueled western coverage response virus (without denial real carnage).

I for-sure answer, best reasons come with: 
1. Lower median age countries. finding disproportionately hits elderly, especially elderly. Cambodia, owing past, old folks, broadly true poorer countries. country full young people could asymptomatic wave and, coupled poorer health infrastructure, serious cases could misdiagnosed flu.

2. Reliance outdoor air climate control. There's little A/C Cambodia; fans everywhere. Again, true many poorer countries, lot around equator also deal indoor heat. natural air circulation going severely lessen viral concentration.

3. Asia, weaker virus. I'm mistaken, Asia strain less virulent less serious. Since Asia pretty much banned international travel since March (as know sadness, since really want get back), nastier European virus may gotten much foothold there.

4. Partial immunity via MMR vaccine. theory circulated back April May owing similarities Rubella COVID, people recently vaccinated MMR vaxx might immunity virus. suggested couple guys good bonafides made observations did. taken seriously time gained little respect theory since then, there's little science now. huge MMR vaccine push recent years (and also ex-pats, included, would get vaxx traveling internationally), many poorer countries would much higher recent concentration vaccinations.

Those best theories answer question. Fucking right. pandemic would significantly better everyone adhered extremely easy rules like wearing masks, social distancing, proper sanitizing. However, humans ""stupidly self centered"". completely, unabashedly incorrect. basing of.... funny using mask social distancing shows ""lack faith God"" many many christians went buy consume hydroxychloroquine presidents told to.  
As christian kind behavior makes blood boil. part movie Bruce Wayne uses cell phone network illegally access microphones identifies everyone Covid-19. Florida..you gotta go go fuck yet anyway. Right, answer going back work.

It’s camping front Mitch McConnell’s house picks one dozens relief bills sitting desk passes it. Count dipshit. mild. agree there. past months people packed bars restaurants; everything closed... well mean supposed be... it’s still same, nobody cares around here. It’s kinda creepy. think whole world would better alcohol lot pot, that's me. I'm realistic, bro. Yeah, enough beds. lack medical staff. Oh 100%. ""This Bidens America"" see voted in?

They already say unrest realizing..he president Right, understanding DNA viruses like varicella stay dormant reactivated later life, aspect RNA viruses, including coronaviruses (and likely SARS-CoV-2) lack. DNA viral infections, clearance exclude possibility reactivation? Slightly confused say study found ""social distancing"" factor results, go say significant factor whether frequent close contact customers... guess said ""social distancing"" specifically meant outside work? Jokes you, said ""everyone sacrifice another 4th"" like even know word means lol 
 
My point still stands reply fits nicely assumptions you. Hope include Sunday brunch. Article cop out. go work still self isolation failure, one ought remedied wealthiest economy planet (as least insofar USA concerned). can't believe unironically wrote Democrat party refuses put forth pure stimulus package vote on. want cake eat too. There's fucking lick Republican Partisanship issue SOMEHOW ALWAYS FAULT.

You idelogically trapped gobsmacking. surge

So, flatten curve? term fashion lockdowners now?  ....now think many public bathrooms even lids toilets.... 🤢 gonna overtake Russia week take fourth place. Joke's you. I'm alcoholic. Critical thinking personal finance classes would absolutely lift huge numbers people poverty supplying country competent informed citizens look themselves. addition examples below, hospital serious non fatal illness, sent home suffer get worse someone else heart attack got car crash. get worse call ambulance course able take parked outside hospital patients can't offload hospital can't take them. die would like see pics like shared show it’s like inside hospitals. Maybe would trigger something non-believer? Probably worth try would remotely think this? think 6 months immunity ends discussion? Really? strains Europe different N. America. get increase cases deaths... unless lag kicks Deteriorating health level . This...looked like neighbors across street least 25 people apartment last night. Except main difference US sitting (usually) 30k cases day since April. yes Europe hitting surge low levels summer, US never low numbers since beginning. one day comparison completely nonsensical. 8 months shit there's still someone thinks must eradicate virus? Wow.  sacrificing 

Like even know sacrifice lol 
 
""oh no, can't get wasted friends, im gonna cry it"" surprisedpikachuface.jpg lol, ""doubled two months"", then. See mean. day dead exclusiv mexican thing. exclusiv mexican thing. today also traditional day dead atztecs mix influencend Spanish Vice versa. understand argue influence mexico greater part celebrated spain say stolen imo heavy statement. like saying mexicans stole christmas europe something like this. spaniards stole it? Boxed shipped back spain? Come man... victim role play. Spaniards done horrible things back time implementing traditions existing celebration stealing racist. first comment wrong ""they celebrate day dead spain"". two numbers presented state. Totally people tested total tests. Total people tested counts individuals negative result one time. Nearly 1/2 Wisconsinites tested, denominator limited metric numerator much less so. thousands negative tests day counted “person” new test. numbers way high, 30% misleading. positivity rate still trending upwards statewide. It’s drastic “oh shit” amount like states &amp; countries, don’t see anything wrong di Blasio saying doesn’t like trend. we’re(other NY’ers) hoping inevitable colder weather/Halloween stupidity/holidays spikes don’t put state back “oh shit” territory cases. Interview? report medical study. comment researcher.

By way, soft paywall. post bypass here, trivial. packed restaurants help...at least stayed packed Paris. good. 

Can still pay bills extra money. 

Some things people extra frustrating ok. Life goes small study well designed, still valuable data add discussion

I agree that. well designed study good tool amassing knowledge reaching conclusion. well-designed study. would say. know means pump dump free every medcorp stock ""holy grail"" vaccine comes 2021, wont wide use 2022 suppose see significance fact they've single digit deaths per day since July--despite surge reported cases started 7 weeks ago ""there's delay reporting deaths."" Sweden we're talking about, America. functioning public health system, they're dealing literally COVID deaths could count one hand, think graph reliable delay reporting. Well, way things going body bags full people lost means livelihood future prospects...

But they'll died covid, ok!^^s schools, restaurants, offices open months that's hardly everything right. people already home hours. strikes something seen something much all. never really proper lock down, gave month half gave up.

It unenforced repercussions violating terms it.

We half-assed testing sites, bids PPE equipment.

We stopped testing effectively reporting cases nobody knows outbreaks it.

We put forth effort effectively report Covid-19 cases others could avoid letting know may exposed. hard build application something like this. We're getting application 7-8 months later.

We enforce Covid-19 exposed people actually quarantine. Nobody stopped people leaving homes spreading virus.

There plan assist Covid-19 exposed people get help needed.

There word President time stating virus deadly. Keep mind guy made time interview time Fauci. Stating opted body bags rather saving lives. guy knew Virus back February completely dismissed even problem.

I guess definition 'trying' much different President's gave American people months seeing glorious stock market plummet little. Clopen I’m extremely extroverted, love big music festivals outside going places. family locked hard humanly possible beginning it’s excruciating see selfish assholes continue ruin everything. Conservatives would rather support concrete wall citizens Private parties gatherings masks removed likely. possible mask effectiveness hindered low humidity. I'm one complaining downvote squad, far it. say somethin that? followed news India detail look funny indeed! past two days shopping streets absolutely packed stores would close today, even hope go coming week. told ""dEaThS sPiKiNg"" He's rubber mallet tool shed. teaching class last Spring, number lectures related covid. everything recorded, quite useful objective look back knew disease knowledge evolved since then. late March last year, scientific consensus we'll able start mass vaccinations 12-18 months. also assumed vaccine would moderately effective. However, quick calculations tell us even moderately effective vaccine would enough end community spread mass hospitalizations. 

The goalposts literally budged 6 months, find absolutely incredible. think goalposts moving, news receiving biased based sound science. That's kind you. bet they'll compare early 2020 #s say much better trump handled situation vs Biden. leaving store keep gloves get home. remove groceries packaging much possible, wearing gloves trying touch surfaces. remove gloves drop bucket cleanser. 3 pairs gloves use rotation, giving chance dry. Masks also used rotation, giving virus time die.

I consider medium scale precautions, level use working hazardous material like fiberglass. situation starts deteriorate - thankfully low risk moment - family adopt precautions. least going change it, change ""selfish fools feel morning coffee important people's lives"" Carbon emissions way down. need keep way life form, return old way things desired. fact Saturday day McHenry County bars restaurants mandated state cease indoor dining, several area businesses defied order, customers continued eat drink inside County’s seven-day positivity rate average increased 12.8% Saturday.

Advanced stupidity. Don’t blame poor working class expected stay home without fucking money There's scientific end pandemic there's social end. Ideally, time, that's always case. former could potentially take multiple years even widespread adoption vaccine (depending metrics used) whereas I'd surprised socially, pandemic extends beyond spring next year. single $1200 check ... 228 days initial shutdown California, works $5.26 day. everyone daily latte covered, even can't pay rent. case numbers sham India. also clear DNA viruses. \*Most\* viruses ultimately cleared. (In terms life cycle, individual cases) neither, lead death! Go Rona! buddy JAG Korea hard-hit city. immediately self-isolated quarantined. respectful enough wear masks they’re sick, brainer. Throw care packages tracing testing virus never stood chance there. Less 27k cases date. 468 deaths. 

US Korea concurrent first cases... would embarrassing wasn’t infuriating sickening. Jackass. comment hidden it’s:

1) true
2) gives credence fact Obama administration kneecapped US selling millions jobs China. Ultimately shining negative light Joe Biden last thing big tech wants people see day election. something twice worse death? small study single store used single source draw broad conclusions, mean results useless... small study well designed, still valuable data add discussion, even specific conclusions drawn alone. Patients stay icu months would big issue suspect. I'm sure do, especially taking tips usually banned places. worries, Mondays always low reporting days France... People Economy

That's opinion though. Good story edit title. would even know hit 25% rate release data data demonstrates current infection percentage? Today Show actually pushed narrative morning. /s Fauci said April 2021. UBI would really nice right millions people... Direct comparisons nations difficult, fact virus move own. spread it. countries highest spread limit it. expect developing countries higher number deaths lack kinds resources infrastructure save lives issue US. US excuse allowing virus spread like has, allowing many Americans die. I'm calling Ecuador Mexico Bolivia enough. I'm calling US (and really also UK). back orders masks last fall didn’t come spring. We’ve also many shipments come (from regular vendors) marked non-medical grade used patient encounters. small independent hospital mainly serves Medicaid population tens millions debt get federal relief payments expected. doubt we’ll make this. really confusing. Friend mine living France like gave wearing masks social distancing. people everything right *months* somehow show effect. really terrifying.. follow either. assume means workforce return office ignoring pandemic situation? Yeah I'm doubting now. find weird. That's essentially Melbourne, Australia (pop 5m)

* Tested? $450 Coronavirus (COVID-19) Test Isolation Payment 

* Infected? $1500 Coronavirus (COVID-19) Worker Support payment

* Police fine Victorians almost $5,000 breaching coronavirus restrictions

Now we've finally first **week zero new cases**, peak 720 daily cases. pretty tough going though. El Paso overloaded even processing deaths — nearly 100 body “backlog” right ( hence mobile morgues). reality sounds grimmer show data  Sure. Put American People come policy. mindset might well change seat belt laws optional.

Please explain Germany death rate 17x lower US even though Germany’s population 4x smaller. 

If it’s governments fault take care people them? put system keep rampant outbreaks control. Places like China, HK, South Korea still getting COVID cases system deal them. want lockdowns, either prepare future outbreaks lockdown early enough long enough get cases 0. latter possible countries right now, putting better system deal COVID current set lockdowns is. Yep. outbreak four people restaurant worked manager said people don’t come they’re uncomfortable... do. We’ll lose priority shifts available, mention won’t making money don’t show work. bound controversial take, IMO reaction lockdowns spring exposed many ""progressives"" really take ideals movement heart simply identify fashionable thing young person.

I know could look lockdowns accompanying pittance ""stimulus"" cheer truly care working class. Begrudging acceptance maybe, cheering.  
 
The cheering came result fashionistas jumping new hotness, #StayTheFuckAtHome sad see this. Nurses deserve support get. bad organizations like American Nurses Association decided support presidential candidate nurse members politically divided. political issue! Nurses need help failing protect them. much kind :) Let tell opinion: really think people stop complaining mental health, living second world war pleasant either regardless, people support patriots fights front line. isolated since march like makes people melt like sunlight touching skin vampire. People nagging life paradise earth people pushed wanted 2020 next year, none us would difficult situation right now. 

Just fighting hostile nation, make collaborating enemy different. civilians get drafted crisis, natural high level desertion, make alright. Essential workers everywhere forced front line defecting efforts time like this, unacceptable say least.  kicks, I'm going say wrong. Perth 200 days zero community transmission. Melbourne brothers sisters say coming months. Unlike you, still hope good 2021. wrong. (NL) 80% people corona-like symptoms ignore self-isolation 20% people actually tested positive isolate.Yeah, that's helping. must forgotten happened New York.

In New York sent seniors died without family buried Hart Island, Potter's Field. burying poor homeless 100yrs. Every week dozen plain wooden boxes forgotten people get buried there.

[Covid Field back would false. Nope I’m US south reality might different guess (quicker reopening)

But agreed Though reason, model struggles accurately predicting covid-negative people diarrhea. BBC even article ""what exactly Well wouldn’t trust everything read, especially articles comparing North Korea. nurse practitioner know Chicago says raking fuck loads money OT Lol. point comment? Please, go try guilt someone else trying remain positive. work me. No, arent gonna stop partying, theres difference popular bar lots strangers group friends meet regularly. Denmark bars, pubs etc. close 22 avoid lot strangers place, feel like that's they're trying accomplish Massachusetts too. Thanks man. able sleep inside house 9 months now. want infect anyone. Hit dogs holler... even they're 4 months late. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hang there, imagine against. majority us really appreciate sacrifices prior comment removed referred people wear masks less intelligent. still believe Slovakia fucking crazy! power move. Catch many current infections possible, lock people future infection rates plummet next month start creep again. long everyone keeps safety measures rates stay well within manageable levels awhile. Love it. Low quality information. Source? personal doubt hypothesis? Mods, remove ^  obviously okay whatever save face. everything covid. hundreds colds still going around, flus, allergies. self isolation enforced, wasn't... commented implies children would die. However mention 99.5% people contract disease survive. vast majority recover fine. Id like see drone deliver 55 inch tv one bit political alone ""purely"". took stance whatsoever. One would think ""critical thinking"" would involve actually reading paper linked. keyword searches read start finish, mention masks either direct indirect. fact, says deaths bacterial pneumonia result damage caused speculate influenza virus enhanced capacity spread damage bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelial cells, even presence intact rapid reparative response, could precipitate appearance severe potentially fatal bacterial pneumonia due prevalent upper respiratory–tract bacteria.*

If find anywhere entire paper even remotely related masks, please let us know, seems I'm person pointed out. People insane, biased, both. continually hear America, country 330 million people many densely packed cities tens millions immigrants, done New Zealand (5 million, 1/100th dense). 

It would literally require revision habeas corpus clause Congress allow military case pandemic, military streets, house arrest orders civilians weeks... simple. New Zealand America. We're small island nation. Maybe we'll get point take drastic action, again, *it's simple*. Hopefully half, lot. They're really dragging us. hard keep influx sick knowing that's many people helping are, fact hurting situation. Frankly see light end tunnel. Maybe considered enforcing recommendations rather constantly letting anti maskers ruin everything rest us  agree. think either Feds led, plan, made case keeping economy open worth steep death toll. missed window mitigate. Stuck worst worlds. Bad economy bad virus. 

We **had** choice make leadership. would chosen bad economy temporarily ongoing fed support economy tried control virus educate folks better right things mitigate spread opening back up. Vaccine would year may temporary problem. 1 year fed stimulus vs. decades long economic depression. made political statement one way other. simply added point view psychology behind people refusing social distance, like hundreds posters. lose game already? probably depend are. Places taking things seriously likely go slow opening. Thats medically sound thing do. Honestly summer 2021 80% normal thats really good enough me. IN, they're already sending National Guard long term care homes help many staffing shortages. Exactly!

I feel like people want 100% safe, however impossible.

There always risks life, can't live bubble forever away dangers  reason reading article like conspiracy type site slogan *What papers tell you*, reputable news source (and critics silenced like North Korea). article bringing Jon Tallinger enough understand ridiculous is. One look guy's youtube harassing reporters street spreading point tiresome ""herd immunity"" conspiracy tell enough. understanding body produce anti bodies.

However saw explanation expert. Yeah they're good counting, give that. 

Just seen lot people freaking reinfections lot seems based misunderstanding data have. 

I actually believe based family virus comes sterilizing immunity permanent reinfections possible. time people healthy immune system able combat possible reinfections.  t-cells implies immune response, necessarily immunity neutralizing sense word. Snow White Halloween would guess Even get vaccine Easter would incredibly happy, ngl Political reasons exempt anyway, probably inevitable protests demonstrations Looks pattern first wave, learn ANYTHING amount devastation man leaves wake absurd. 78% population living paycheck paycheck

what get possible. median household income USA $68k. Median mortgage payment: $1556 per month. 

Like wtf people spending cash on? outside California NY taxes pretty low. bed bed. need doctors, nurses, orderlies, janitors, medications, o2, testing etc. Assuming medical staff get sick themselves, long work intense pace enduring emotional trauma burn out.

Well 7 months get everything ready place deal staffing issues that. easy. mom's friend became nurse actually go bureaucratic bs finally gave her, license. Makes sick stomach. many talented people who'd awesome health care deal nonsense top dealing stress professions entails. want people behave someone love needs responsible right thing.  Good post, fully agree. noted many subs last couple weeks appear reaching major turning point terms people's position lockdown/mask policy. He's still great. like Trump Lite. wide tall Thank Thanks additional information.  ""new people tested"" stat seen before, least places look.  

So anyone ever tested past goes different category? vaccine gives virus ""significantly reduced"" rate serious illness literally cold flu stage. TL;DR ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!""

I think applies pretty well EU tbh Eat shit Omg thank much. Excellent notes  thing think making harder students financial difficulties, since presumably buy masks dime. saying argument sound, course. responding claim enough data draw conclusions from.

I responded idea table specifically shows mostly mild reinfections. 

The table shows weighs cases shows score severity first infections (79%) severity second infections (84%).

Is meaningful dataset? really. 

Does say poster claiming said? Definitively not.

I try make claims data says trying prove data *does not* say.

That's bad. virus probably bound fall somewhere SARS-1 mild coronavirus, that's severity falls. complex that. I'm suddenly reminded there'll inevitably huge queue people waiting vote near deadline probably become massive virus hotspot.

Vote early, leave there's huge queues! think morality change hospitals country overwhelmed? 

It's heard sooooooo many warnings ""hospitals overwhelmed"" past 8 months almost never come intense localized springtime situation inn New York required extra freezer trailers mass grave.

The mass grave already Hart Island burying homeless people 100 years. put Covid deaths family well.

As far freezer trucks, dont think used much they? certainly didnt seem feature city benefit medical staff traveling parts country. situation staff burned overloaded.

But also 6 months prepare dont think things crazy summertime they? children adolescents aged 2-19 years 

* Obesity prevalence 13.9% among 2- 5-year-olds, 18.4% among 6- 11-year-olds, 20.6% among 12- 19-year-olds. Childhood obesity also common among certain populations. CDC 2017, 1 12 children asthma.7
* top reason missed school days. 2013, 13.8 million missed school days reported due asthma.

I think lot school age children comorbidities make vulnerable COVID complications would like admit. one wants think ""big kid"" obese, risk factor ignored. Asthma common among children adults. change leadership mean trump gone agree.

Just look Europe, countries liberal virsus still rampant.

I think Western counties different Asian countries difficult completely remove virsus. nZ Aus exemptions due remote Specificity 99.6%, lot false positives. got error 404. voluntary isolation works government need lockdown? Sounds like reaching justify evidence going preconceived notions Neither Fauci, Irish health minister German health minister. Man it’s almost people actually smart know they’re talking publicly announce things Good luck! That’d frustrating situation in, especially SHTF bottled water hard find. article shaming governments allowing people isolate without worry losing jobs. 

 ""So, really know society, know you’re going make possible self-isolate.""

I know lot people hate reading articles, one side people like you. telling people become overly reliant lockdowns, needing lockdown proof government, people, screwed somewhere. people reusing respirator multiple times? much stores? They’re made country, right? heck, GP nobody ever heard elected ""leader opposition"", accused government ""forced euthanasia"" ""fled"" Denmark comparing government North Korea. source site one ever heard either. 

Do people really realize hyperbolic hysterical seem posting sort crap? Science FTW 🙌🏻 think 83% specificity detecting asymptomatic patients strange result especially corresponding 100% sensitivity. comes error model development threshold selection ""COVID"" vs. ""no-COVID"". seems like tuned model assume likely COVID not.

At 83% specificity, going result alarmingly high rate false positives areas low prevalence. active infection rate 5%, test would return ~76% false positive rate.

For context:[Beware False-Positive Results SARS-CoV-2 Antibody never good enough sub, first time here? even news though. already pretty much knew similar studies. Fuck her. hope everyone stayed away kids well also probably it. Maybe time go back good ol' fashion shunning. Sheesh man personally feel like towards mid april mostly driven ground Funny even brag 2.3 trillion dollar emergency fund *26.9 trillion* national debt (at present). 


Like even brag ""emergency fund"" point? country almost nothing brag about. complain democrats insistent country nothing wrong World Fallacy makes feel better state party left country in. supporting party that's attempting pass bill making workers unable sue worker's protection contract COVID - 19. even Democrats versus Republicans point - that's humanitarian issue. could support group good faith that's okay that?


It feels like Republicans support anything anti Democrat, becayse actually believe it. 0 controlled studies showing masks work real world, fact many showing opposite evidence even necessary surgical setting. controlled lab someone wearing mask every day, touching it, breathing hot breath it. available well headline enough let anyone take article seriously. It’s also bad minimizes terrible North Korea terms censorship. Covid take 2 weeks get over. 2 weeks period thought contagious period. Covid different everyone, months. Bet ""collapse"".  Yeah, nuts. SARS-1 also mutated rapidly pretty much dead ended itself. luck top beating quarantine machine. Counter SARS (1) immunity 17 years Next, showed patients (n = 23) recovered SARS (the disease associated SARS-CoV infection) possess long-lasting memory cells reactive N protein SARS-CoV 17 years outbreak SARS 2003; cells displayed robust cross-reactivity N protein SARS-CoV-2. clicked post see wtf waitress wearing. deficit. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure trump made employers taking tips legal. agree Thank you. hope guys get control. moment like watching really scary bushfire burn side world. Good luck! good - really people expecting vaccines developed precision speed one year. 700 oxygen thieves Exactly, sliding goal posts make hard big reason people fight back. Thank you! Despite best efforts hold 3yo covid test traumatizing. exposed days ago family member running fever. I've argued times last months per capitas useful comparing countries population that's within order magnitude other. makes little sense compare US (330M) Andorra Aruba (0.07M 0.1M) example. No. More. Excuses. Yes. Selfish entitled. many americans spoiled. wonder immigrants want come US. Americans spend time countries less developed maybe appreciate have. would end crying mommy go without luxuries take granted here. ever truly value education country, college always means end? feel like there's major disconnect rich poor comes *purpose* education.

I can't count number people know said wish go college ""because could gotten job without student loans"". includes sister, questioned anything this, enough money able isolate, seems happy criticizing poor people truly misled.

That said, drop senior year, work restaurant, homeless yet again. I'm far elitist. social justice. terms education, think far valuable use critical thinking skills simply getting job dare say, ""woke"".

Though say, totally trust doctors. seem mostly interested compliance fearmongering, seem sympathetic struggles working poor, there's LOT nuance leaving (types masks, viral load, lack focus self-protection extreme focus giving others, former would much valuable terms gaining level control this.)

There's saying ""beware intellectuals"". lot rural poor think ""smart"" people telling us something, they're also smart enough hurt us.

But think far less likely they're actively trying hurt us (microchipping? WTF?) they're trying profit (just Jeff Bezos become trillionaire ""it's safer buy Amazon"" major chains never shut down... guess they're less contagious stores?)

We've always brutally capitalist country... can't get believe sudden changed eight months ago.  Rounding turn! /s Oh, look, sabotaged containment efforts, proves nothing works contain virus. policy completely undermining government, saying government agencies work okay privatize them. American Trump country reporting in: least C passing. people either denying virus deadly denying numbers real state averages hundred new cases day total almost 200k. state legislature started petition coronavirus restrictions lifted. pictures social media people packed bars shit one even trying anymore.

Meanwhile seen friends anywhere except discord video chats since April family friends kids started ignore lockdown thing. friends teachers caught (and fortunately recovered) Coronavirus wen niece's first communion tried socially distance like responsible person, literally impossible. church packed one wore masks. Combine get together afterwards consisting family telling ""take mask pictures."" I'm literally called crazy family members wanting die shit.

I just... I'm waiting someone know die shit.

I would almost literally *kill* C average right mostly someone know *will* probably die death may well mean something. rioting allowed virus gonna virus matter are

[Taiwan marks 200 days without single domestic Covid-19 Dude, harassing me? I've said nothing personal you. headline flat wrong lol. United States great 15th cases per capita. 28,700/1M. countries Europe around 20-28k/1M. Additionally testing countries per capita basis. EU testing would positive cases per capita. don’t see enough Africa. solar coolers impressive. tried 'soft lockdowns' Victoria wernt enough. Thats ended stage 4... stage 2 3 wernt working.
I feel UK long winter. Kids school bad move, spread viruses like wildfire take home. Goes along nicely world leading obesity rate, care health. Okay. virus going around years, don’t “get rid” virus. cannot lockdown years. carry on. Seriously. stand GM last 5 years apparently awesome. know board give job her. Tbh, idiots can't self isolate follow guidelines majority people catching it, let them.

Stop lockdown let people use common sense survive idiots think worth dying Halloween party suffer consequences.

It's half year cases going higher, quarantine worked USA whatever reason, want argue reason cannot denied worked, stop it.

It's insanity keep going sick tired keeping lockdown self isolation morons keep rest us living normal lives. Thank taking discussions t-cell immunity oersobally? gone yoy personally even know are? tell comment history that. hope everyone gets better soon trust could work, machine learning great pattern recognition.

AI missing, ResNet50 (or similar) residual neural network, classifier. eVeRyThiNg zOoM Aw, man, yeah... I'm glad guys. hard even imagine place well hand could zero community spread whole day. I'm guessing large politicized there, unlike way government forced be? Like, *know* lots high-contention political issues 'strayyans follow general struggles climate action conservation since that's field, clearly cooperated communicated well enough bring earth. really glad also painfully envious. nothing short violent alien invasion could bring Americans consensus *anything* right - maybe even then.

Also, Victoria last get together? feel like read Melbourne recently came of/announced end super-long lockdown. - guy refer territories states, me? :)

You're right - far governors go, I'm proud Gretchen Whitmer lot ways. absolutely right, work cut her. conservative state representatives sued her, blocked her, stirred hate opposition, even forced stripjob rolled back validity mask mandate, among things. last month (I think - time fucky year) bunch far-right loonies arrested federal agents plot kidnap torture her. Insanity. trying keep people dying. 

A little half us 'muricans just... watching awe little half us respond pleas cooperate keeping safe death threats. come hang guys while? 

I'm really hoping bushfires give pass season. seen aftermath bad wildfires yet still cannot even conceive must like - still is. guess that, least, areas less likely burn - said, hopefully deterred sick stupid tourists. I've always wanted travel AUS see happening good long time.

Ugh, one step time. Gotta wait til end week see US even still country anymore. point near-certainty tomorrow - election day - least sporadic violence.. real threat become widespread.

Thank much kind words. really cool talk someone outside shitshow. family really careful continue be. hope loved ones safe healthy, lack nothing need stay way. 6 last 9 days 0 case days, woohoo! That's masks protect airborne transmission.

SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus N95 respirator medical grade surgical mask combined safety goggles prevent airborne transmission. protection – Wear NIOSH-certified N-95 filtering facepiece respirator entering AIIR designated SARS patient-care N-95 higher level respiratory protection available, wear snug-fitting surgical mask prevent nose mouth contact large respiratory droplets. Discard respirators upon leaving patient room area.  protection – (i.e., goggles) protect eyes respiratory splash spray. Goggles fit snuggly (but comfortably) around eyes. face shield may worn goggles protect exposed areas face worn primary form eye protection  Let's ask /u/jeopardy987987 seems thing yeah forgot healthcare probably big one. 
I also privileged country university free all, suppose consider student loans thinking either. lives none businesses. shutin long want regain normal lives ignore output. Here’s hard truth, people wear masks supermarket go office break room sit around eachother without mask friends work intimate game night.  polled questioned would contend 100% mask complaint. really, unless want ones brain locked indoor forever... yeah, guess that’s good gets effective vaccine That's nonsensical metaphor use. risk coronavirus randomised way like Russian roulette. NHS Test Trace informed today. Upvote living shit this.

I’ve read far many articles lately along lines : 

 - Long Lasting Immunity 
 - Social Distancing Masks forever! 
 - “were never going back old normal, normal now” 
 - *still* might get vaccine 

Obviously one article doesn’t provide clear counter (yet) damn it’s nice see good news here. proving article accurate. Utter denial mired saying ""everyone numbers 4, 0 5 username nazi sympathizer"" would make true, highest fatality rate Scandinavia, far. sound way rationalize explain read comments replying, write things I've already agreed on.

The way Sweden approached pandemic utter failure, again, something authorities responsible decisions made taken responsibility time time again.

I feel comfortable hanging bringing attention article horribly poor one post deleted, I'm done here. He's also fluent 10 languages they're risk. young teacher afford mask longer. America first Work fine...work family BBQs...weddings...bar get togethers...and on. Need work listen to. Need party, people fuck off. Cool, cool, yeah, party like 2019... die like 1919! 


What fun! 


/s I’d say perhaps COVID isn’t end world threat thought March... it’s entirely possible (likely?) point future, significant threat arise...

This situation pointed broken entire world dealing things... USA may great, Europe isn’t handling well either. proven completely useless. learn nothing res evil???!!!!!??? Sorry, posted much today. Made new post, article might elsewhere Reddit too. science based, one policy may excess deaths dissent mean it’s routed science spring Sweden dealing considerably deaths last 3-4 months. seriously think can't record date death numbers they're dealing 0-3 deaths per day?  Nah aspirin give stomach issues prolonged use otherwise little issues. Heart patients take small dose daily. Like 100mg. Kid size. Ok. get tested again? test considered accurate enough? Inevitable border leaks? Yes. 

Inevitable lead community *spread*? 

Not far, we’ve shut incursions multiple times zero effect population. Every time happens, seem get better it, surprise. 

Looking forward nice uninterrupted summer luck. I'm addicted fear.

For example, believe decent vaccine relatively soon. believe continue make strides treating illness well. believe locked foreve, places locked currently. 

But real conversations happening, know know, etc. bars went got food licenses open  asymptomatic people, MIT phone app analyzes cough sound would save millions money time. (If th ratio asymptomatic people really high.)

Although sure actually works, Ex-ce-pt unfortunate fact heart disease cancer CONTAGIOUS. People really mad curfew, I'm wondering solitary activities everyone planning hours cancel? 

Maybe actually targeting nighttime social behavior people upset it. See, actually something vary much testing country (instead positivity rate show spread population much better).

We're bad place, need science-focused possible listen experts. “The new order requires everyone age 5 wear face covering public. We’re making clear everyone. exceptions —and exemptions maintain social distance,” Baker said State House news “It’s hope simpler, straightforward rule becomes easier public follow easier local officials enforce mandatory order way,” said.

Well, *is* lot easier enforce now. sure yet. step-father hospital uncle low blood oxygen.  

So far everyone else seems getting away it.  Including 94 year old grandmother. Coronavirus comes night. Trump admin. goes way everything wrong.  Immunity based severity. Many people get virus really get ""just cold"" still develop immunity serious illness. Genetic similarity want look at, virus closely similar SARS. pay CDC Trump admin want public...  Independent bad source? removed? UK residents wanna comment? remdesivir slammed reg approval negative data conveniently relavant since? SHOCKING looks like multi billion dollar money grab without providing nearly benefit that's advertised. would thought would happened publicly traded company long standing government connections.... says 3 billion one specific vaccine. also mentions vaccines may similar amounts 

That seems also much higher read elsewhere. seems reason. 

This based translation above. Reddit truth goes die. ...which hoax totally unfair happened me!!! Mask compliance widespread. Many reports rural America complying. See Sturgis Biker Gang Cosplay Festival exhibit one. like riding bike bunch assholes. Better pretending know everything like guys paper monthish ago. ADE thing rare present viruses. think need put fear down. sound addicted it. careful? course. also stay locked forever look excuses stay constant state panic. I'd posit maintaining kind stress would run immune system pretty much activity. E-xac-tly! Well said. Without economy anarchy chaos streets. would nobody producing medical equipment medicines. would nobody creating gasoline run ambulances. would nobody operating critical infrastructure. many slaughterhouse employees brought infection co-workers hanging friends, attending weddings church functions, going eat party work?  90% cases asymptomatic nearly irrelevant surely. Next none cases would self-isolate would probably take less precautions spreading virus idea had. Fourth day straight now. ... that's life. They're around. stopped caring votes ago. actually motivate know😁 both? I'll even throw third factor, limited medical knowledge treat. r/Enlightenedcentrism already making pretty stringent recommendations, like ""avoid physical contact people live with."" Whether people follow determined. I'm regular contact someone may exposed. employee roommate's work tested positive. roommate getting tested Wednesday. Yes structural / systemic response really matters point hear misinformation West (about masks, hot weather false beliefs, fake cures etc.) repeated average person ran into. national mandate war-like propaganda Vietnam ended shenanigans around Feb-March.

In addition, can’t really expect everyone responsible need everyone top game. real actionable things must enforced closely monitored top down. Also people must feel sort social shame / burden social responsibility following protocols order work. I’m hoping loses election Twitter ban media ignore doesn’t voice. also hope rains doughnuts don’t see happening either. World pop 7bn, need two jags that’s around 60% global coverage - assuming trials successful. It’s right. Self-partnering failures susceptible idiots wearing masks hanging bars close 20 random people 3 hours. ""sealed"" / acid resistant pills cause less damage Emotionally, I'm in. 

Mathematically, I'd like add superspreading need tied event, members large social group frequently meet changing small subgroups.

Empirically, see result certainty hampered lack TTI data collection West.
Also, found hints large underground home transmissions, totally convinced enough stop ""socially active"" people.

Biggest caveat: ""Socially active"" people could well refuse cooperate TTI comply Covid restrictions. many segments society vaccinated majority teachers. Like firefighters police. understand, concern nobody gives fuck. worker understand people get rapid test. also understand Super GC, needing hit deadline would also give fuck test type. right? No. happening? Yes. 

When someone needs money feed kid, they’re living paycheck paycheck, they’re gonna wanna wait 3-5 days. There’s failure social safety net, failure job system. long them, fine. like people vaccine work talking ""everybody"".

Yes weak generation party getting drunk bar ""sacrifice"".  got idea talking live here. fact upvoted I'm voted shows state sub. bunch idiots far interested pushing ideology reality virus.

In Melbourne cases going tried post code lock down. work.

We tried mandatory masks several weeks. nothing cases continues grow even faster. 

Finally full lockdown unessential businesses closed along allowed leave house one hour day. thing worked.

Masks work people contract virus doors friends/family one wears mask environment. I'm literally zooming meeting right taking place medium sized conference room.  1/3 people wearing masks, 1/3 people zooming, 1/3 people wearing masks.  Everyone roughly 4 feet apart around square tables.  1 without masks anti-maskers.  others would consider mask compliant.  county 230k people clocking 65-100 cases day positivity rate roughly 20%. think you’re little confused word science. doesn’t talk, study physical natural experimentation observation. Also, asked really odd question can’t answered correctly.  mean strain would fly air infinitely? mean cycle people virus get air new hosts? mean person infected virus travel infinite distance? good gesture considering bought them, he’s going force everyone vaccinated dubious Russian vaccine, might well try in4 aspirine sold everywhere “other people” it. means too?


Especially since ""other people"" medical researchers study article cited articles PMC. Fuck adbot Wow, made tear up. Good work!!! Okay... I'm tripping. I'm remember reading exact comments spring... Doesn’t work told stop crying five times little boss  Cry river bro  Nice gesture honestly there’s nothing wrong major leaders vaccinated it’s available them. even true lol... Memorial day* true. never get COVID-19 vaccine, think need two doses. different years past. Plus still lot news discussion went through. normal enough me! lol downvote comment even read it.

I'm done kid. Enjoy ignorance. Lol ok basically stereotyped fucking awful argument. ACKNOWLEDGE ISSUE. understand stereotype. point hate Americans us right thing. Stop crying man. Fuck sure! even comfortable vaccine developed way longer 2020. Oh tell covid cough sounds gross. Received 2014 May 1; Accepted 2014 Aug 11

So “other people” it. means too?  You’re right: Better 👍 says AZ vaccine 3 billion doses rest similar amounts. According math, 3 main vaccine candidates 9 billion doses. seem right, unless I'm reading wrong. mean BLM movement? Yup, take even time properly distribute large scale globally, especially poor countries. Countries strong anti-vax movements mandatory vaccinations laws take even time might end isolated vaccinated population (or end getting isolated point entry serological tests perform etc.). edited comment replied, I'll address second part said “I get stereotype” understand people reddit make fun americans even though it’s representative

What actually said understand people hate Americans Americans also getting ravaged covid. dismiss stereotype anti-mask party polling nearly half country support. American apathy reluctance change behavior far prolific giving credit part problem. also compared locked winter re-openned summer. also risk getting hit car wizzing walk people's yards avoid it.

The chance catching Corona outdoors walking someone astronomically small. someone risk adverse, even leave houses everyday? commented yesterday’s post this: it’s Sturgis 2.0 wouldn’t calling ambulance cavalierly pay like USA

No...they would still call, many would unable actually afford ambulance visit/drive hospital. says algorithm. It’s probably self learning system it’s ai gone April year. it? /s We'll settle less extreme less stupid agree somewhat, everything relative one's experiences capabilities. many capable perspective required understand true hardship suffering. 

For example, sister-in-law melts downs, really mean melts down..ugly crying panic attacks, things like car engine making noises, wife able watch dog weekend, slightest insinuation wasting life abusive sham relationship. 

Conversely, acquired chronic illness several years back devastated health. Drove career, changed family dynamics, lost relationship many closest friends. hard me, persevere try keep trying get better (I'm getting there...chronic infection). struggle physically mentally, however mostly keep wits me. Even drastic, sister died cancer 33. never really opened showed much fear. Although wish would I'm sure would cathartic. human.

My point agree assessment hopefully make segment population mentally tougher, build;d better coping skills. said, capability spectrum. wife's sister therapy, hope overcome issues, never going David Goggins. defeatists giving up? Unfortunately interview, austrian TV scientist-doctor mentioned it, written source. everyone afford food, would buy mask instead food?  get it. numbers expected still like 20 million. 3,000,000,000 unrealistic. I'd ecstatic eat words, there's way. also Academic Report indicated flair article academic report. *Utards Small family gatherings bigger spreader bars.

Can really trust everyone family isolating cautious except meet you? people probably can, takes one uncle/cousin/etc. thinks ""I've really good quarantining matter go ONE THING tell anybody""  Pretty impressive group that's ""practically immune"".

Who said that? evidence claims. we're wrong, better err safe side without giving hope. hoax sure shutting lot hospitals down.  Yeah, hate articles drop comments like, “(insert infectious disease expert here) says may *never* get back normal”. 

Like, reporter asking questions maybe ask, “can elaborate? exactly might normal? would suspect this?” let guys make vague bold estimates never ask specifics. General scary statements fuel clicks guess ... Dude I've met Chihuahua. smart. thing even remember times saw it... Haha. Where? started lockdown, ICUs would overwhelmed November 20th (maybe 16th, maybe 23th). maths.

People warned lower spread since two months ago. warned again, Paulinchen listen. able lift lockdown depends weather people listen now.

PS: Even could make R==1 ICUs overrun, disease would take 1245 days till herd immunity would cost 7500 lifes per month. Perspective enlightening That’s cool! Thanks sharing also ignorant badly Sweden compared neighbors, including getting Duh people desperate kill people pull 6 year old articles wayback machine, change title add dramatic comment.

I see people posting Spanish flu 100 years ago. clear, issue opinion sources completely fine everyone else different opinion, including yourself, also source? Interferon cured Matthew Mcihanguy shit brains.  I'm tired people expecting write every argument relevant something going say anything. 

Masks reduce transmission. Argument over. part debate. 

The original post says almost get back normal everyone wears masks. true. mean wear masks. mean one person wearing mask bulletproof. 

Wear damn mask. Stop playing semantics. Stop hunting one sentences play gotcha, there's moron internet nothing valid. don’t buy it. me, end social distancing return old normal. vaccines rolled virus brought control, can’t see need social distancing. What? everyone using cotton masks? They're like $5 everywhere. See ought close borders abandon internationalism? Ironically actually become CNA pay training still pay min wage forced it/get certified would leave better off. fourth patients taking day day low-portion **ibuprofen** (normally 81 milligrams) conceded admission deal cardiovascular illness. 

So one it? Aspirin Ibuprofen?

They're molecule!

The article even link original scientific paper!

This really shaky journalism... Fat people... Good, citizens England taken care financially decision. Sure there's excuse proper masks, supply ample now. bandana like protecting face cheese grater. People smart enough buy make reusable face coverings. It'll environmental disaster result. Wow, lockdowns South Korea, 7 cases week?! That’s amazing! Sorry ignorance, please could explain South Korea / city handled covid-19? I’m really curious learn worked well. experience, wear masks outside take home / person's place absolutely correct seeing looks like nasal vaccine actually deal Type West Coast B&amp;C East Coast mutation Houston, TX. mutation worries regional Coalition New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut defeat hand washes masks. would correct, never see Americans comparing India per capita. basically thing compare significantly smaller nation. also see comparisons states like New York would useful. Also never mention comparison big reason country Belgium high rate trying accurately report data. know certain US states trying keep numbers lower means reporting. Yes, that's way always works.

The people susceptible pick virus first. People susceptible lot reasons - live communal housing, take public transportation, spend lots time crowded bars, whatever. Exactly. idea parents vaccinated (in 70s) means go stay even I’m not. Quote context - ‘making apology’ leaving lockdown late (our scientists recommended locking month ago) pursuing million avenues, many extremely expensive none worked.

He’s batshit insane like Trump he’s hardly better. He’s plain old corrupt. comments refer ridiculous headline... I'm sure those, see disposable ones much washables though Yea? science say Coronavirus travel infinite distances air? NZ 'alternative lockdown' work tangential sheriff's offices see lot them. definitely helps accountability, seen shit like deputy called explained ""if writes one god damn chicken shit ticket"" he's going get fired. Mostly sheriff want piss voters.

The flip side incompetence rampant. rarely skills required law enforcement skills required politics overlap. Even non elected positions generally shallow competence experience general practice fire everyone importance administration changes. also know quite sheriffs show work maybe 1 day every week two generally give damn offices run. spend time going fish fries church events running offices.

It also sometimes invites corruption. know one place Arkansas sheriff agreement family owns lot land constitutes significant portion population. agreement deputies go area, family votes (and maybe pays) sheriff. suspect moonshine, hard say. I’m sure way, also would take cooperation federal government...ie would subsidize nursing homes, create communities could largely act bubble, provide financial support can’t go work stay home. no. government would rather say nothing.

Not mention many “vulnerable people” want live lives. grandparents want spend Christmas families, since may see next one? Send home, sadly can’t control morons Albuquerque almost full, too. Local doctors predicting capacity reached coming week. Yay! We're #1! 
No seriously sad. Yea, feel that. 10 open air wouldn’t bother me, understand would bothered. work can't figure close advert. right, lemme call coronavirus task force tell implement Australia's plan, get personal phone line representative tell start paying people stay home

oh wait... Prince Charles got March. Thankfully recovered, obvious implications line succession.

(Edit) Someone else mentioned 121 guests one time. must truly enormous house  Personally would rather see Yellowstone erupt cause volcanic winter.


/s lol got spanked. Meh. Almost australia back normal melbourne relaxing rules already, 3rd day row zero cases. contact trancing it’s fine around 10 Cases daily, see NSW. 

Turns sacrificing grandma piece cloth front mouth isn’t great tradeoff COVID-19 cruise Bermuda Triangle … Mystery ! Intrigue ! Pandemic ! think still looks ill. ill first released hospital. 90% accuracy good all.

If 1 million people tested 100,000 incorrect. Even 1% failure rate high right, obviously joey bismarck's fault enacting sweeping changes wanted hug grandma instead taking consideration money variable. Greed control right now.  think talking Iowa specifically governor. particularly shitty. 

You totally correct Wisconsin. story nonsense.

Indonesia 267 million people, 14,000 coronavirus deaths. country 267 million people, going 3 4 million deaths per year.

So graveyards plenty space before, 3 4 million deaths per year, additional 14,000 deaths overwhelmed graveyard? especially considering they've setup field hospital.

Weren't *tons* field hospitals set first wave too? dont think got used all, they? know one town also happens well ahead number 0, certain number beds already begin deciding gets bed

But also minimum beds first wave dont think anyone triaged ElPaso? article mention work, it? people still going work, supposed work home? 

I think keeping schools open could okay, people still going work meeting homes. RT top tier coverage though. They're actually willing publish Zizek pieces well. morons (like many inhabit sub) love sensationalist bullshit headlines like glued TVs shitting pants since March understand saying, even days test close 20,000 people, rate stays high. Community spread rampant here. Bars still open. People still hosting weddings, trick treating, going dinner friends, we've got hunting season Thanksgiving right around corner.

Testing going bring rate people following protocol. social media filled people complaining saying virus even deadly. 

'if vulnerable, stay home, we'll live lives'

I'm lost words...I really losing faith humanity 😔 Kinda neat. similar tags co2 canisters, full, use empty. Except people going die, serious running beer gas. would love claim amphibious struggles, alas could barely swim begin excuse lol. 

Getting better, see. even know causes conditions yet. Happy, hope eventually. now, refuse pretty much social company people get sense lol. 

The one tiny silver lining end crisis disability chronic fatigue disorders, maybe spur research uncover answers us. would hate think that's took get answers afraid confronting great wave disability country due utter lack containment control disease. really wish anti mask idiots would sign advanced health directives refusing treatment. take anyone's place. jannie? Yeah housemate people backyard last night. supposed 10 people masks ended 15+ people took masks started playing messy drinking games shut whole thing down. Sucked Yep, government putting doctors situation ration care. first step preventing LITERALLY saying “COVID real. Masks work, wear mask”. That’s yet somehow certain Republicans(not all) refusing it. covering foreign spies killing thousands people would treason, it’s virus it’s ok? anyone comparing countries finger wagging instead looking factors contributed one country worse time fix them

(i mean, there's pretty clear reason, y'all gonna like answer!) I’m ER physician. think custodians exposure me, easily. may intubating I’m wearing PAPR. custodians clean body secretions afterwards. Multiple times per day. states sort warning - like sort example another state country went would know avoid steps take prevent and/or remediate it. right... state government bear responsibility. 

Wisconsin’s legislature pure shitshow. It’s almost winter, bury snow. Someone deal later. Hopefully it’s emotionless robot. Nobody deserves go feelings young. don’t even wanna think Texas would lol Government thinking using antigen tests also borders. Anyway, mass testing supposed slow spreading flatten curve, give hospitals time avoid collaps, stop disease completely. buying time right now. agree open borders testing borders still new cases imported. thought Masque Red Death would make great theme crusie line? First all, celebrating?

Second “should” “will” different things. course we’ll take precaution awhile vaccine, it’ll huge help, guarantee compliance dwindle soon after. Birx traveling country speak health officials Covid. Birx real deal. know probably not. unstable police officers move without background checks doubt higher ups held different standard. That’s exactly true. private organizations mass testing workforce. Look sports leagues/production companies/casinos (yes, Wynn resorts actually invested building on-site lab testing workforce guests). 

The problem lot private companies don’t view workforce valuable enough asset protect. society consumers aren’t eager pay basic lifestyles either. Good bot! maybe magically immune like kids teachers thought be! say whomever wrote standards, forced CDC person so, first one cruise. K. pay read entire article, k Meanwhile, America proving we're kid immature wrap mind around ""you one marshmallow now, two marshmallows 5 minutes"" problem. rule exactly following?

Downvote next want, rule break? Explain it. actually important part. terrible deaths are, it’s hospitalised/ICU rate length time spent problem virus. Obviously, reducing spread severity also reduces deaths. going get worse. I'm calling here: hospitals going start turning patients housing patients parking lot. No, wait. That's already happening. Hmm... Enlighten me. Thats nothing. SD hovering 50% hit 60% positives past week. ur following rules, others? sure wrote amphibious second confused. seriousness hope get better, happy Take care Canadian friends.

Ps. call residents Winnipeg? Winnipegians? Unfortunately, essential business. freight brokerage. thing is, essential we're actually office, actual contact customers, drivers, freight. home three months company still made much money May (at home). They're abusing system technically following rules.

Granted, America stupid, especially north here, exactly inspiring. liber+arians developing countries, people grew comforts modern society could ever take government granted. quarantining never ending it. getting numbers controllable manner see awful things like 100k day. Since beginning, defeatist confused mentality ""quarantines work, better stay open"" delayed real progress could done country.

We COULD slow spread manageable levels see 100k day, would require effort admission COULD chosen different path 11 months ago. countries done it. running balloons yet?  hahahhaha Appears based WI's DHS dashboard show nearly 30%. sure difference is. No, hoax turned corner. Trump said so. Repeatedly. 1. 5% upper bond estimate, way actually high.


2. past experience says lot double: Right now... enacting sweeping changes speak aren’t so... Geography definitely helped. Apart border towns straddle states, closing internal borders practically possible.

Climate? Probably much, Australia come winter. major cities still experiencing heavy storm weather. Again, child... Adults obligated answer questions. control here. nobody. Why? beginning Aus lots cases - totally due policy people committed right thing. employees able work, children go school, etc. literally evidence support claims? Didnt dr atlas already admit wh gave up? Lol Uh, quick look map.  Honestly, get extremely lucky. Really kills old people, infectious measles / smallpox.

And think bad poor leadership certain country. Nobody using keep card machine cards anymore modern world. genuinely understand about? I'm chalking anything up, I'm asking genuine question. good mate? Absolutely nothing first comment even remotely implied malingering play. right. Also [Slovakia tested people (half population) single day, impressive. could come forward, better. saying voodoo works coronavirus? Protesting also optional. U can’t justify large gathering fits agenda. opinion across board. Opening windows classroom there’s breeze doesn’t whole lot. enclosed space really. open window doesn’t magically make much safer. *could*, might lead think open window equates safe environment. Lotta idiots - point?

Why don’t compare countries well? people always race bottom rather looking people better try emulate that? go away, it’s already invisible think disappeared. uncle ICU mother still thinks it’s big deal.

Cognitive dissonance new normalization deviance. pathetic.

Edit: someone told I’m supposed use one these: /s think that’s BS?!

Edit 2: Bing bong bing bing bong sounds exponential growth big holiday event. Celebration spreading nobody realizes it. Lookup smallpox, incredibly successful virus mortality rate 30%. entails absolute back lash would follow. 

New York would burn.  course there’s options. 

Okay, sure. doesn’t really contradict anything I’ve said. geography climate play role? Seems like Australia, New Zealand, lot Asian countries mostly control everyone else struggling doubt policy. think already Boris Johnson Prince Charles . He'll say that, also part plan reach herd immunity, fancy ""we gave long time ago"" Turnin corner! No. WSJ paywalled. Vietnam almost 100MM population ignorant troll curious, people’s reaction county friends, families, neighbors get it? still concerned even hits home? I’m Chicago sometimes feels like live two completely different parts country. Let fucking try it.  terrorists plain simple.  reason prevent legislation protects public health. bad feeling get vaccine &lt;60% effective, people act like 100% effective, cases spike, unrest ensue restrictions/lockdowns imposed blame put unfairly scientists. worst case scenario, think entirely unrealistic. Horrifying could make deal personally get shit ends would totally that. I'm pretty sick shit. Seems like like 4 weeks 2 weeks event starts really show up. 2 weeks Sturgis SD seem bad yet. cares mask mandate NSW, NSW government strongly advise wear masks people listen. Number daily new cases close zero ,There still around 10-20% people wearing masks public. wife continues make argument much west faced sweeping epidemic quite like Eastern countries have, least ones everyone readily remember. grew India, community response health conditions part life her. Whereas Europe US, community buy-in big necessity recent times. think shown growing individualism. yet... That's one many reasons, though must admit main reason, hence mentioned it. point wave Covid, right leaning areas hit hardest. Simply fact.  live state hate people Sterilization! Let’s start guy problem years years movies showing ravenous zombies instantly cured. Well good thing people know entails power something like this. oh god tiny town happen god obligation believe infectious disease expert failed provide substantial evidence are, believe nobody like you? popular actor all-around nice guy, line succession British throne. SARS-CoV-2 proofreading mechanism. detects flaws created genetic material discards them. course proofreading mechanism 100% airtight either virus going mutate slow compared flu viruses lack mechanism. Ok I’m sorry misunderstood point, seemed like see things improved. Hope you’re still wearing one keeping safe Good news: going die something covid-19. Color skeptical, don’t think people went 500 person party pandemic gonna obey mandatory quarantine. real source link? site isn’t dog shit? hope becomes norm wear one certain settings inkling may unwell (like much Asia). personal don’t mind used now, however it’s compulsory outside hit 38 degree (100f) days Summer, bit unbearable.  thousands laws financial criminal consequences things affect public safety drunk driving one. Castle rock v Gonzales court case went US Supreme Court.
Basically says police need enforce law, even specific court orders.

In case lady restraining order ex husband. ex husband kidnapped kids. contacted police several times didn’t anything. Ex husband killed 3 children went police station shootout there. Can’t remember killed cops Hopefully heavy fines Yes many football fields it? Block roads? Typically people trying sneak Perhaps hit limit articles. You’ll likely fine talking R vs - talking people believe voodoo vs rationalism.

fix it! Hmm idk everyone putting mouths thing liar deserves it. trump covid19 party together. tell stories withheld truth citizens expense. still going strong, aunt one them. screeching outbreak never had. results unacceptable. It’s going start thinning soon enough. second wave Spanish Flu pandemic far worse first. every reason believe happen again. Little easy everyone socializes maple trees beavers i'd like see national mask mandate implemented *yesterday* preferably, y'know, five months ago, pretty sure i'm fine shit dude doctors dont get kickbacks drugs prescribe? many doctors get rich oxycodone then? Yes exactly, Americans tend uninterested rest world view confirmation biases. don’t like US government, means everyone world must fantastic job. viceversa. husband isn’t careful. time sleep downstairs. :(. pandemic sucks relationships. obligation reveal real name personally identifying information absolute nobody like you. Stay strong Korea. can't it, we're lost. done, maintained, North America right political will.

Atlantic Canada effectively kept covid away lucky enough dodge serious first wave, locking community transmission, opening slowly despite lower case counts provinces. New traveler isolation, mask mandates, testing keep schools fully open.

New York looks like using similar strategy Atlantic Canada requiring outsiders (exceptions certain workers) isolate arrival. New York advantages low population, isolated, place visit Dec-April. Yet still seems quite well strategy. sucks! horrible set back her. Hope ok fitbit, opt COVID 19 data study within phone app. seen much yet, seems like great way spot symptoms early right algorithm. Glad someone else noticed too. Dank Americans idiots countries handling virus poorly mutually exclusive. Therefore data lead completely irrelevant talking (which part getting downvoted). 

The part attitude. Word street Tom Hanks got too. covid19 relief bill Senate GOP protections companies employees sue covid19 related issues.  Trump administration wants remove protections people pre-existing conditions despite fact would fuck millions covid19 survivors long term complications.

People fucking pissed bullshit absolutely major push holding people accountable amounts genocide.  None swept rug. time. Foreign media allowed present China, yeah, verify that. get control, remember reaction watching Chinese military 

Lol trust anything suggests unde control? Capitalism finest. everyone Yeah shit hard mate, global plauge, sometime hard things even cause pain, sacrifice etc. live one times. Wait happened castle rock well known covid causes automatic certain death anybody goes restaurant.

And hyperbole? STFU, loser. Dude melbourne, think understand. seems comments made, fine implementing rules order minime COVID ⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣤⣶⣶

No, that's real question, that's tired ""He loves dictator, given freedoms forever"" bollocks kept trotted even restrictions lifted guided science. get it. 

Is really *that hard* sit back chill out? little impulse control lack foresight have... this? 

I can't think single event would want attend would awesome I'd OK 1 1000 attendees (or person close them) dying. ever anywhere awesome thought ""This great, even care kills grandma dude sitting front me. Death worthy price pay experience!"" sure fucking haven't. Look Belgium's numbers- one Europe's highest COVID death numbers per capita, yet 1.5% country's population tested positive last two weeks announced lockdown 2 days ago. Belgium's example shows hard first wave necessarily grant lighter second wave without serious restrictions. Yea shouldnt burning (infected) bodies safety precaution? I'm glad I'm taking melatonin 10 years now. thing many benefits crazy. isn’t even headline worthy. Atlanta bars packed brim again. Shit get real bad. kids hybrid. much better them. love mom, I'd rather skip visiting her(to keep safe) kids could go school. I'm sorry much work you. Maybe take comfort belief profession one noble. Lol suggestion Cuomo regime cares nothing virus control. He's transformed office basically alone. want low expectations people.

You incredible knack stupid arrogant time. ready go, winners hats them.
It good see well efficacy different vaccines work out. They're breaking big obvious ones. dozens smaller 100 people ones. bottom line right partial options effective. try partial methods wrongly trying attribute coronavirus spread social gatherings opposed things viewed essential like businesses, schools,etc. social interactions important can't pick choose ones convenient. attempts missing fact coronavirus spread anywhere people congregating. use partial measures want partially effective Lol lying. It’s hard prove pm researchgate cv takes less couple minutes keep condescending know you’re fucking lying oh, wanted compare Australia. gotcha. specific next time. 

you seem understand horrifying economic pain protracted lockdown would cause given live late western capitalist hell state. also seem understand reasons like 20% population decides power makes decisions, can't get fight better conditions middle lockdown.

in future, please refrain looking nose people know say ""oh accepted facts good them"". thank you! Thank you. Highest daily death toll Arkansas far - 3 million population btw) Yes. think lot people get really confused things change. Like science good woulda known. clue knowledge, time trials, etc. Change recommendations information. perfect anyway recommending masks initially since think Fauci done wonderful job stating current best practices. Especially ridiculously stupid leader. surprised super-spreader event. Smh. People country always learn hard way (those claim hoax someone know ventilator, late blame government enough...). Quarantine! good for? ^(/s) You’ve hit nail head. I’m travel nurse New England right now, I’ve working overtime last 2 months every week. call earlier today go help little bit surgeries finished could go back apartment.

He's elected official 'judge' label confusing.

Also, county level executive officers civil defense responsible for, among things, dealing disasters. hear much covid.

People made clear comply masks social distancing hundreds thousands died mention millions infections.  needs consequences behavior.  Real consequences.  House arrest, fine whatever.  Anything better allowing continue. said two options... people don’t get... hospitals ration care, people going die.

Staying healthy isn’t you, it’s preserving capacity. government problem Korea China, New Zealand etc Could weight loss. knew (recent) history would repeat. know want die covid, expectation I'm expecting much vaccine even getting flu shot mean get sick catching flu.

Fuck assholes.  even better, staying home. Bargain shopping! Considering people act Black Friday, I'm sorry say I'm even surprised EO law. childhood vaccines need people get booster shots later life.

Afaik it’s dtap shot, that’s like every decade something? MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), hep A, hep B, varicella, polio don’t think I’ve booster since grade school. overthink this.

He brought family situation listed one risk factor (age). attack called bad person. simply suggested give kid break possible.

This anonymous forum, think anyone take anything said seriously said based incomplete information understanding, good faith. son go school? u wife go work? cant lockdown anymore. 2 weeks turn 2months. Enough enough, already lockdown little. People families feed ! mean actual data show wore masks properly? unfortunately people wear masks occassionally wear nose still think count mask wearers despite severely limiting protection. you’re vaccinated flu season charged murder throwing parties? Mexico rich white dude bussed hundreds people state (currently lockdown) neighboring state throw party. Governor pleased. American Way™ Mostly wearing maks restricting contacts limited few. bright side mean get COVID-19, antibody protection (assuming vaccine candidates come relatively high efficacy levels) much less impactful gotten vaccine all. 75% efficacy (roughly Pfizers data hoping show next month) means *if* virus infiltrate immune system, able fight something resembles cold sniffles - without every coming close debilitating symptoms associated disease. that's great thing, vaccination needs widespread next year. 

IMO think headline meant bit catchy. Americans expect 'perfection' vaccine, know tool that's necessary start putting pandemic behind us. Trust me, day start getting approved FDA going beautiful thing. moon landing scientific achievements epidemiology. Well old SARS-1 vaccination research lost proper attention SARS-1 flared never came back. 

They took everything started trying tool towards SARS-2. 

Basically safety mostly worked out, efficacy still air. Making effective coronavirus new battle one began recently. Meanwhile, I'm complaining neighbors party 25-30 people OP needs seriously STFU, stay room thankful he's still got roof head. get pay rent 3 months still think gonna make rules. Absolutely everything! data daily reports capacity treat covid19.  Victoria would 18th biggest state USA. stop making excuses hope thousand people would usually network thousand actually attended plague parties, decide cut toxic morons lives. Thanks! Good luck you. Stay safe. spookiest halloween go history. sweden much cases deaths per capita county herd immunity know vaccine going change little right? SD pop: 884,000
Us pop: 330,000,000

US Pop/SD pop x SD deaths = US normalized death number

33/884k x 12 = 4479 made decide start wearing masks? I'm saying people get it. 

I'm saying simplified make sound ones do. Nope. I’ve worn one twice since start - times get tested didn’t infect anyone positive. community transmission state 50 days test sewage look unknown cases well encouraging everyone get tested even mildest symptoms. 

If cases rise, I’d wear mask heartbeat protect community it’s warranted right now. last outbreak dealt well quickly never spread. herd immunity shunned one simplest effective ways preventing transmission -- wearing mask. “Take f---ing thing off,” demanded aides showed wearing masks early days virus, he’d told weren’t fail-safe. **“It look good.""**

Alternate denying problem blaming others failures.

This guy's life story. one surprised turned con man ways public policy. guys hilarious lmao wait vaccine even people beginning go normal life again. Sorry we’re covid 🤷‍♂️  gov remembered won’t able stop covid 4 weeks nearly 10 months figure stuff out. Scrap white Xmas bet bet still lockdown Xmas. Rare time sub good hearty laugh. Damn. Haven’t 15 years. Sounds good right now. again, anything house sounds good right now! HIV managed modern medicine though vaccine comes im done caring shit

Fuck feel sucks, vaccine 100%. even smallpox, measles, polio. flu vaccine waaaay less effective, mutates.

However, vaccine can, either, work perfectly make symptoms they’re deadly, success.

I’m currently month 7 COVID journey. Haven’t recovered smell taste, developed ulcerative colitis, wife wearing heart monitor next two week she’s developed palpitation. 

If vaccine could made symptoms less severe, would’ve okay feeling sick couple weeks, recovering. However, knows wife ever truly ‘recover.’ Cat shit kicked sandals. ""them""? Scientists? know... pretty disappointing.  (Embarrassing actually) Outdoor activities pretty unlikely spread disease. study China found that, 7,000 cases, one transmitted outdoors. insightful passages I've read front line Dr while. Yes. Wearing masks social distancing refraining g eating imbibing crowded indoor places much sacrifice make. Downtown Orlando packed idiots too. Victoria one iSlaNd nation state (rather large) iSlaNd, salute you. pandemic ends drops endemic level transmission. 

The virus actually go away. certain point majority immune systems know cope it, circulate immune suppressed endemic disease. Ok you’re right. I’m comparing now: surprising look numbers Geneva. found pretty hilarious people putting faith vaccine flu vaccine typically less 50% effective. good know we're looking other. Surely Trump blame Hey, like jurisdictions (say $5000 fines), think could money two parties 1000 people; could afford erect massive solid golden statues city square people shitting one another caption ""fighting socialism"". I'm serious COVID. suffered chronic fatigue know crazy serious is. Wish long term effects put blast people understood serious is. sucks :-(

I really good advice.

#besicklikeits1925  think you’re missing OPs point brains aren’t wired deal this. Humans social creatures, coronavirus stripped us ability socialize (safely), surprisingly many (myself included) decided risk contracting spreading worth maintain mental health.

I’m posit whether right wrong, it’s fact. yes, survived millions years evolution also dealt number severe callings herd. first world country, medical science is, shouldn’t accept ~0.5% population dying. lockdowns answer, maybe?

Title: Characterization Myocardial Injury Patients COVID-19

URL: injury frequent among patients hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) associated poor prognosis. However, mechanisms myocardial injury remain unclear prior studies reported cardiovascular imaging data.

Objectives

This study sought characterize echocardiographic abnormalities associated myocardial injury prognostic impact patients COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted international, multicenter cohort study including 7 hospitals New York City Milan hospitalized patients laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 undergone transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) electrocardiographic evaluation index hospitalization. Myocardial injury defined elevation cardiac troponin time clinical presentation hospitalization.

Results

A total 305 patients included. Mean age 63 years 205 patients (67.2%) male. Overall, myocardial injury observed 190 patients (62.3%). Compared patients without myocardial injury, myocardial injury electrocardiographic abnormalities, higher inflammatory biomarkers increased prevalence major echocardiographic abnormalities included left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, global left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction grade II III, right ventricular dysfunction pericardial effusions. Rates in-hospital mortality 5.2%, 18.6%, 31.7% patients without myocardial injury, myocardial injury without TTE abnormalities, myocardial injury TTE abnormalities. Following multivariable adjustment, myocardial injury TTE abnormalities associated higher risk death myocardial injury without TTE abnormalities.

Conclusions

Among patients COVID-19 underwent TTE, cardiac structural abnormalities present nearly two-thirds patients myocardial injury. Myocardial injury associated increased in-hospital mortality particularly echocardiographic abnormalities present. Giving money banks airlines 2008 fair tax payers. Giving money via pandemic assistance companies need either.

This government prints money ass time sorts things. print bit give people basic hygiene? no, country covid, lol you’re wrong place man Lol, what? Fuck :) drink impact lot. Reasonably fit men clean drugs normally drop 50s rest/sleep. Getting extremely drunk actually push 100 bpm least 24 hours. 


Long story short make sure comparing clean state. woman heart rate likely impacted monthly cycle. force rule order issued president executive branch government force law.

Additionally, nobody said anything EO, state mandate. also effectively law: mandate made governor, power given legislature state emergency. Overall, mandate effect law

Try less confidently incorrect next time? That's absolute given. guarantee though. Private company contracted government Trueeee 😂 Google guidelines NY. aren’t even strict. could party 50 NYS regions well, 10 areas currently “phase 1.”

I personally choose attend hold parties right now, agree people careful. might want direct complaints Gov. Cuomo. Supposedly everyone thinks he’s good job, he’s still meeting standards. really know someone dead? fuck sake suck much right now!! Damn live NZ made sure biggest Halloween we've ever USA people go massive parties. Take antidotal info heaping salt wife works hospital indiana/Illinois line said one day last week every test positive. single test came back negative. first time shes seen whole year. 
Now obviously hospital sick know many tests done. keen fact seen 100% positive rate 24hour period before. good, enough info stock toilet paper yet. housemates always considered close contacts? housemate positive test last week. close contact (as defined CDC, room time all) days preceding positive test close contact following positive test. traveling upon arriving home immediately began isolate room home. share kitchen only. leaving food outside door minimize leaving room. Anything read suggests soon someone starts isolating shared housing minimize close contact, 14 day quarantine starts. Since never “close contact” mean still quarantine? assuming yes technically live her. shouldn’t rule 14 days whenever someone household longer contagious (after 10 day isolation up)? actually made one paper mache boyfriend wore coat jackdaw mask... bad go anything. I'm hoping June Canada's numbers low enough Halloween June actually party. http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/COVID19/ Don’t sad. Biggest party attended 300-400 people party that’s wedding day.   questions answer. classified pretty high level. Exactly. Something useful considered schedule 1. Nothinguseless would schedule 2.

We would Desoxyn example methamphetamine medicinal uses. Thank lol even bother replying that, pretty much felt haha would’ve. Looks fun way many poor souls, 2021 going get cut short every year exist all. hundred thousand even make 2021. definitely wear gloves. sold time went get some, looked since. 

I accept one logical ways got it... touching something grocery store something. I'm sorry loss. Yep, there’s tons underground parties also. mind blowing Like who? Germany model suppose even cases spiking again. 

Australia New Zealand benefit much smaller number cases geographic isolation.

China literally welded people homes, isn’t going fly Western society.

So left countries locked longer US (Europe example) look France much worse new cases per capita US. 

Places like Mexico Argentina lower case totals reflection better testing capabilities US example good handling virus. prime physically. Enjoy it, get sick injured age. frustrating convo brother today. He's Indiana &amp; gotten sucked misinformation machine, largely avoid talking politics him, dead end.

Inadvertently, Covid comes he's telling dad's assisted living facility still let people inside rooms allow social distanced meet ups masks, etc... common spaces &amp; outside. 

I saying makes happy hear, ever important people keep safe.

He told staff think stupid, breakouts started came staff, difference make family come inside visit such? 

And explained unfortunate staff take precautions private life help protect people depend them, limiting risk. need staff &amp; nurses take care people live &amp; cannot live independently.

That causes go whole tangent people die starvation lockdowns COVID, etc... even tries say Trump &amp; Biden's rallies caused equal # cases, even though scientifically impossible-- seeing Biden pack 5,000+ people together without masks.

But digress...

I try saying virus partisan issue care Republican Democrat. said Covid cases continue rise overwhelm healthcare systems, able get help anything-- like got car accident broke arm worse. disease itself, ripple effect systems.

He got quiet (as wants shut let go) simply told love worry him. worry get see again. pleaded take seriously.

I'm sure impact whatsoever, felt compelled try get understand means basic, non-political level. 😕 relying determent primary mode enforcement, gotta make penalty scary. actually learned today podcast Anglo-saxons, applies, right? country would be?

Because dozens countries hit extremely hard this. Many extremely well-developed. get feeling, however, might certain country whose inhabitants think unique everything happens country unique. Perhaps everyone get tested first? fact anybody physically school absolutely horrible crime gigantic proportions. Noticed fall spike went vertical immediately school started? course could coincidence... Dr. Osterholm best he? episode week really great. look forward every week. would never want live totalitarian government sir. Fuck Right, cotton masks filter biggest, stickiest globs reduce velocity aerosols, however billions sub-micron virus particles float right like nothing there. think Americans actually oblivious virus.

You seem think change administration going make virus/restrictions disappear? Same, 3 couples chilled backyard movies 150"" projector screen outdoor heaters running keep us warm. might get downvoted.. protests don’t seem issue.
I work ER nurse usually see cases people test positive start see symptoms, I’ve gathered people around Chicago pretty good “being careful” especially public... problem I’d say almost everyone I’ve talked directly knows gave - it’s passed smaller inner circles people get lax

The way see it, inner circle 4-10 people MAX, strict contract honesty amongst members going mask wearing. 

I think lot people “inner circle” involves one persons “inner circle” another another etc idea doesn’t really exist. I’ve happily enjoyed seeing laws wife maskless understanding doing, 9 months quarantine. family hand refuses stop seeing friends sometimes maskless don’t see them. 

Back point, it’s small group gatherings long term interactions without masks that’s spreading this, protests reddit? Really, mostly see besides obviously troll argue. wife passed month 7. haven’t recovered smell taste, developed ulcerative colitis. wife wearing heart monitor next 2 weeks she’s developed heart palpitation. 😞  Shopping. Bro made narcissists mad haha pretty sure vampire Exactly. Politicians always lied. crux Trump's ""drain swamp"" rhetoric. Except turns swamp swamping swamp ever swamped before. Here’s question keep going back point. 

What want differently starting today? states mask mandates (or counties within states), already forms lock down, testing increased substantially since spring/early summer, better understandings help symptoms/care people, vaccines development, potential antivirals/treatments may yield results (like steroids).

We continue push PPE manufacturing suppose argue need lock down. seen, locking simply delays inevitable since doesn’t eradicate virus.

I get behind lock 1) hospitals getting overwhelmed (which looks like happening states) 2) date vaccine begin widely distributed lock would serve bridge point. governor taking lot heat preventative mandates. problem enforced local police even county health. People actually purposely gathering large numbers spite governor. insane. People around afraid anti maskers. name adorable thought made name well. work home, son 2. 

So really go grocery store (early morning). block mile, walk around one two times day.

Sometimes take bike trail miles. Things like that. never anyone else. never people around (not close enough think about). 

We gone gas station.  Always payed outside. wife went doctors once. But, timing line doctors office.

We've gotten pizzas. order online (and tray outside grab yourself) papa murphies. Lolol guy obviously got panties twisted dig post history Three ply medical masks readily available now, hold back. Roughly 6-10 times better cotton mask. N95 masks another 5 times better that, roughly. high crime official negligence N95 masks still available general population. love getting name stuff. Jacksonville, got flu virus named 'cause kissed bat dare. happens lock late. UK acted quickly decisively earlier like Ireland, seeing rapid decrease daily new positives, cases UK starting stagnate deaths way up.

Ireland actually country Europe cases quickly going right now. measures heavy price pay it'll worth long run. Man, one Utah broke 2000... We're screwed. got tempo fit Saints Day. Next year work figuring bang Speedcore bell. fucking bad

Im living whole life scared thing. vaccine doesnt change going away. Ill live We, society, laid holidays periodically cold, dismal months social gatherings look forward to.

=/ feel bad wasn’t invited Might well ring every victim heart disease cancer. people can't develop immune responses. immunity fade time. can't take vaccine due health issues. Vaccine still help greatly, give hope. many people know died corona far? different enough explain difference

art similar case numbers, Victoria locked Europe continued open up. Results obvious. important thing you’re still healthy idiots partying get sick. There’s need get hung things can’t control. It’s argument internet.

It doesn’t matter.

Go something makes feel good. @2:20 source says 15 days enough get us way bending curve -- did. I’m glad don’t know anyone like personal life.

I however meet medical doctor week touting right wing/anti science opinions virus, unbelievable. one old school ones working past retirement age, probably prescribing benzodiazepines cure everything. Well live inadequate supply PPE hospitals sloppy quarantine practices fueled spread virus. Exacerbating issues slowness track trace procedures used government. 

Schools actually little bearing ever spread virus personal research whilst virus spread schools wholly misguided even attempt suggest primary source virus spread ""everywhere"" fucking pillock. Protests outdoors everyone masks, haven’t linked upticks surges. wear gloves gas station grocery store, denies one primary attack surfaces. ought reconsider claim careful are. doubt major holes perimeter currently overlooking. AI exists becomes sentient somewhere line, doubt would take long realize humans flawed organisms. happen, I'm gonna best find way fight machines side self preservation. Well spoken. telling co-worker day got reactionary rather proactive. keep going. Goes institution researches medicine/science rejects them. think blame placed administrations they're letting things like happen. organisms predators. mean humans meant deal this? mention countries dealing fine.  take multiple risks day? Amazon package arrives sign contaminated pen rub packaging breathing heavily breathless anticipation? forgot: schools either. Like, never. really simple though. 

As noted another comment, safety less worked out. tooling effective novel coronavirus whole new ball game.

Personally, based limited data we've seen far, Oxford/AZ would first choice. early trials prevent retransmission all, lessened symptoms. J&amp;J Pfizer seem best chance (of western vaccines) offering degree sterilizing immunity. least based limited data seen researching different vaccines. Amazing American dream leaders handle basic responsibility... think fact pretty much flu season year points towards behavioural change rather geography. Brisbane (2.4 million people) 1 hospitalised case flu year. don’t wear masks (except occasional older person sick wants wear one). Hand washing, reduction large gatherings winter, etc helped keep covid bay influenza well. Buckle up! Fuck Ditto. What’s stopping private enterprise anything thus far? SARS-CoV-2 mindless virus. people spread DDoSing healthcare system. Damn that's awesome, small town suppose, feel like may know  mental health since started, really taken nosedive last weeks. completely unsustainable don’t know much longer take this. got protect elderly ones risk, also got let majority people start getting back sort normal. blanket lockdowns simply work. Sadly true. guy Germany whose name dont remember said, actions taken covid suffer worked good people start think danger inconsequent. Therefore virus spread need another lockdown pisses many people dont get necessary it. people think lockdown useless. dont get 20k new cases per day (in Germany) tenfold new cases last 30 days. Yeah coronavirii don’t mutate like that, sure dog, call lying sack shit without providing evidence it

Ah, MGTOW poster well. Since we’re engaging personal attacks, well, I’ll let part speak whole ""college experience"" ridiculous. go college get degree. refuse partying, drink, type stuff. Nope. Plenty border communities too. example; Coolangatta Tweed Heads Queensland/New South Wales border literally different sides street. Coolangatta southern tip Gold Coast forms part South East Queensland (3.6 million people) large parties broken Montreal people got 1000$ fines! world population live first world countries. forced people quarantine number ways. apartment legally mandate cannot leave, consider locked up. Sure technically walk outside arrested immediately thrown prison, consider locked intents purposes.  could lead stronger national response. take 10000 ius every day im registering 60 0-100 range. diligently taking least 3 months still little lower would like. agree me. possible people whole lot protect other. saying ""its deadly driving car"" real dishonest way saying ""230,000 lives big deal me"".  bookings packed brim without people arrested pandemic. sticking 1000+ people room together along everyone else arrested night spreads virus Wearing masks going suddenly get control. herd immunity vaccine really good therapeutic. Wearing masks going slow spread people dying hospitals overwhelmed like NYC area spring. Well got news adults act like Serial selfishness uniquely American problem also huge problem New York (as parties show) way virus gone rest country really shown incredibly fucking low bar go, New York truly nothing Georgia Nebraska regard. lol day article COVID antibodies last long, one says last long.

FUCK DAMN shit impossible follow

at point consider news, positive negative complete utter bullshit. real thing need keep safe wear masks reduce amount virus inhale, avoid social situations gather people small spaces, rest utter bullshit written scientists rushing firs discover something new. lying sack shit. pray God justice finds you. It’s DNA virus. clear RNA viral infection, virus gone. feeling vaccines fine, people sub refuse believe it. They’ll fear monger try find million reasons happy it. see people demanding people stay inside homes times anymore. part people get probably need things outside house, there's lot things done relatively low risk. thing people get upset people act carelessly take precautions, think understandable; there's big difference going exercise outside throwing house parties. Random people dancing close packed dance floor making sharing drinks blow together etc etc I'm exact same- hindsight, feel stupid thought wearing one earlier. ask cousin much ER visit, couple days hospitalization, missed work would personally cost her. Even good insurance, cost make pause think negative non-fatal effects getting sick COVID. spread far lower UK’s 

Not I’m sure UK go eradication even still, 4 weeks fair amount mobility seems unlikely slow surge. guess: betting big vaccine months off. mutating “any time” is, based understanding virus, fear mongering misinformation, we’re trying suppress countries, especially west, dream successful Korea comes fighting Covid. mean, import cases left right, open schools, restaurants, bars apparently even clubs (in zones?), recently introduced mask mandates – basically lax restrictions compared e.g. Germany.

But still much successful thanks incredible Contact Tracers. Explain 300k excess deaths.  covid19 300 people dead year last year variance dead year year change substantially reason? Sounds like safe. point stop virus entirely. That's impossible since February. goal slow spread people dying hospitals overwhelmed. group dozen friends gathering together going bar following precautions, anywhere level massive indoor groups indoors like morons did. exact thing happened NZ Jacinda Arden, achieved almost none previous election promises managed get enormous landslide victory likes never seen history current electoral system, responded COVID-19 well mostly listened medical professionals. someone lives Western Australia New Zealand passport backup, think 2020 lottery. 

Chur Melbourne cats hard yards. feeling life going back relatively normal starting creep even WA dropping hard border. Mine 8! borderline laughable. I've taking supplement year now, never back get tested. I'm living hope supplements working. Usually people come go day. dinner, vast majority counted 121 people ate. whole day, probably around 200 weren’t once. Gotta go visit spouse’s family. NY 100-150k. guys least 25-30k. Unfortunately, nobody could seen coming could ongoing inflammation Covid, exercerbated pregnancy. Even though nine weeks early it, wary pre-eclampsia. I've three times, I'm speaking experience. doctor. advice buy urine test strips pharmacy test protein urine (they also tell heading towards gestational diabetes. Diabetes complication Covid) get blood pressure checked regular/at least three times week. truth there, people chose listen wrong people. LA Sheriff manchild

FYI Sherriffs ELECTED officials! 🤯 blame zombie movies. shit. 4 weeks start. Australia finished 100 days that's seems gold standard effectiveness. Maybe try reversing Heart Conditions patients immediately! pretending like going national disaster? guy far person who's going financially ruined next year, going turn worse recession millions people middle class below. Two turkeys ham. like 4 catering trays worth Mac cheese, three trays stuffing, etc. usually make five gallons puppy chow keep everyone’s sweet tooth bay multitude pies ready. really idea you’re talking Source undercounting? See article thread about.

For claims we're overcounting? guess could find comments sub, generally kind social media / newspaper comments. ""All people would died anyway, coincidence tested positive weeks / days death!"". Dry ice expensive, already freezers. Based hard peen gets thinks permanent lockdowns seen Sweden’s graph lately? Yeah. seems bizarre never thought before.  I'm sure NYC thought would fine. took longer develop medicine would kill everyone contracted equivalent airborne HIV. lot state governments, including Wisconsin, limitations must pass balanced budget.

This situation required well-articulated fast response national government Macaroni didn’t anything first one he’s certainly going second. imagine actually reason expect anything ordinary recovery. outcomes rare, especially case remains mild. wrong direction. turn left, right (or vice-versa).  source that? Exactly. even 5% population infected 7 months. can't expect people put social life hold another 2 years thing really gets control. That's unfortunate truth virus. Keep telling whatever make feel better. 

It's beautiful sitting beach 0 cases Yeah. point would relieved rona take away tbh. would sad got parents sick somehow chosen stay touch everyone since beginning is. None us know many times get see point lives regardless corona. Good them. took seriously hunkered worth it. wish places would follow lead. aren’t something? 

It’s almost like they’ve given unlimited supply money low interest rate South Dakotan here. Confirmed cases 1000 day high 1559. entire US proportion percent population would 400,000 600,000 cases per day. positive test rates running around 50%. half total deaths came October alone figures get worse cases steadily risen dramatically last couple months.

Too many people simply care result. frustrating us taking necessary precautions. [And doctors [fleeing country NZ seen increase medical workers applying move get jobs exacerbate staffing crisis USA. one likes talk NYC virtually herd immunity point. Nothing come this. German, use regular basis, usually use translate English German. found translation DeepL lot precise Google Translate. Something ""mess"" necessarily mean ""incomprehensable"". literally first wave. second come fall barring vaccine yet. different letting alcoholics get liver transplants.  Behavior dictates treatment time. way ever going work money people actually stay home

Can't give peasants glimpse ""trickle-up"" economics problem lockdown, half arsed measures, what's going happen time. Except it'll worse time less people follow recommendations. economy already better navigated lockdowns. practically open (hoping announcements weekend) open distance literally second wave. I'm Melbourne. incorrect. tested positive today (lack smell cough set already) case seems mild know long term side effects folks don’t mention much...



My question honestly expect long run “recover”? heard even asymptotic immune system gets borked stuff like that...  something expect life (obviously it’s around long enough know certain, appear permanent like slow recovery)



Should expect anything else “recover”? know folks report long lasting difficulties breathing seem severe cases, expect even mild case. even close. means community transmission rates naturally declined. Due timing Southern hemisphere really first phase. Imagine life hollow parties everything cannot live without it. 

Sad. “You know, say we’re testing much.” Thanks dude, blame asking. can't really see thing. weird. can't even see sick locked away. try stay safe protect family. think things better were, survival rate higher cousin got sick, still real sucks. try let experience make paranoid cousin could lived another 20 years. solution. wondering suggested solutions are. lot predicted vaccine solution near future. solutions forthcoming, need conversation long term. far, heard anyone even talk that, given election US maybe understandable.   It’s really hard imagine. people stay ignorant things part, social creatures majority people also sick this. It’s going take people lose someone love wake fuck up. Happy cake day! figure that? vaccinating, we’d nerfing virus can’t cause type hospitalization surges push death rate up. We’d need light restrictions, anything, point.  means Melbourne beat winter colder part spring, flu season.... people stop complying believe able meet indoors this. Deaths lag behind infections, IFR 1% Belgium, would mean 10% caught virus early October.

I suspect IFR turn slightly lower hugely significant portion Belgium's infections happened last three weeks. possible 20% infected now. Look, can’t argue anecdotal evidence. CDC Infection fatality ratio 24 year old .0002 .02% according CDC. contrast New York Times lists dying car crash .97% chance. always people immune compromised. cannot base entire society around them. take extra precautions diseases spreading rely herd immunity not. (myself included) decided risk contracting spreading worth maintain mental health

Depends, taking precautions try lessen chance catching this, saying ""screw it!"" going back normal activities?

And course, next big question ... mental health fare contract it, spread loved one friend dies it? 

Yes virus reduced ability socialize, time live age technology allows us substitute physical social activities quite readily. cohort option tight circle people committed keeping safe practicing mitigation protocols interacting rest world. reason think another round lockdowns produce meaningfully better results time around? Like governments something different, gonna repeat March, flattens curve month shoots back again? Uh infection rates go naturally period, community transmission slows. see correlation. 

Zero great also period number easier obtain. afraid that, respect that.

TBH, afraid it, anyway right thing do. Nope. Victoria one coldest parts Australia unpredictable weather.

We cases everywhere. live away major cities near Great Barrier Reef. People returning overseas Covid that's got cases. March scary. Federal Government brought 2 weeks quarantine people returning Australia overseas. people wrong thing, went spread it. government brought 2 weeks mandatory hotel quarantine upon returning Australia. 

When individual states outbreaks, states closed doors (some still closed.) state, still Aus States postcodes cannot travel accept visitors unless quarantine hotels 2 weeks. contained state hasn''t case since March. Life back normal aside social distancing signs public places. even wear masks part country there's Covid, businesses workplaces open, schools open, go pro sports (with socially distanced seating), testing free, fast available everywhere. People break public health laws charged, fined face court accordingly. People given little opportunity spread possible. sacrifice bit live normally possible. put travelling far home life town normal, safe fun be. 

When Victoria's second wave blew up, masks made mandatory, people stay within 5kms home (now 25km) unless work carer's exemption needed seek medical care. could leave home 1hr exercise day, 1 member household could go closest store per day. made enormous sacrifices get here. longest lockdown world. needs done people want safe. Movement drastically restricted.

Other regions countries make sacrifices entire nations suffering result. deflecting. question trying avoid simple: percentage experts agreeing constitutes ""knowing"". far I'm concerned focus releasing non-violent offenders, especially drug offenders. one going jail prison using drugs. They're sick need treatment.  someone wont wear mask deserve ICU bed get covid-19?? There's payroll? sign up?

Must Swiss bank account doctors get $2k per Covid death from. Say it, again. 👏👏👏V-I—R-A-L L-O-A-D 👏👏👏
say me... said gonna bad need creative find ways get emotional needs met much possible distancing. Oura's ring sleep tracker awhile  Yay countries closed early basically covid-free now? doesn’t sound like viable option open borders. thought lockdowns get hospital numbers down? not? valid question no? Goddamnit NEVER going done thing. really hoping baby born quarantine would get meet family 1st birthday. end get 2 shots year keep thing contained, sign up. eventually scale. Lol torrent little bro that’s objectively happen. Again, son, obligation give personal information. agree probably face sort punishment. refusing treatment letting die murder. choose eat McDonald's drink Coca-Cola exercise can't choose get infected air. Clearly loss personal freedom boogeyman throw convenient you. kept NY less 1.7% infection rate 6 months.  states could used play book, everything point contain virus.  

I don’t know you’re downvoted.  guess people can’t relate real leader point history high risk complications? fatsos? Interesting. According reports local hospital SD there's maybe 3 ICU beds left right now. They'd disinfect make part mouth touches disposable. problem they'd quarentined away actually rational part society. many people can't extrapolate beyond end nose. 

It's disheartening many folks ""complexity challenged.""  telling person home pandemic? mentality US countries terrible controlling this. went lockdown nearly two weeks ago. I'm sorry cunt Johnson continues torment country jeopardize health safety. Lol American here, sub feels like 90% USA. even post made another country, Americans come comment US. Seems pretty US-centric.

I superlativize either, ""the"" Anti-USA sub. Try r/ShitAmericansSay “...the economic social impact Melbourne’s second lockdown since crisis began enormous. Australia’s government estimates 1,200 jobs lost average day across Victoria state, demand mental health services surged illnesses contageous, people responsible taking care prevent mitigate them. Covid contageous high risk people, rational people want catch it, can't even leave house everyone else spreading rampantly.

And, record, believe McDonald's Coca-cola responsible acknowledging health risks associated foods.. much like cigarettes labeled risks. Spoiled children spoil country feel like sort unchecked mental illness man. Never areas people fight mask mandates social distancing? No.  almost mitigation proper planning works something.  100k new infections daily.  300k dead.  Things objectively worse March April data proves it. HIPPA dude. Unless blur faces guess Oh lol see, yea would funny. actually work hospital? see every day, take care COVID patients almost weekly. took RRT-PCR took 15 minutes results.
I heard it’s accurate test.
Thoughts ?  Eating McDonald's contagious. mean need 10-15 mins unmasked space someone it. 

""All need is"" specifically implies this... Y'all, please. restrictions get big enough difference? Yeah, except fact SARS-CoV-2 impedes germinal centers leading loss follicular B cells would indicate durable immunity reinfection limited.  

Additionally, convalescent patients seen low decreasing levels IgM class switched IgG memory B cells 3 months follow-up indicating that, like coronaviruses, certain percentage individuals, immunity fleeting.  college level immunology virus. complicated. Would saying “let stupid die” son/daughter went party caught covid? humanity dude. Literally scientist credibility said 2 weeks needed.  Spooky skeletons. Sure I'm saying releasing felons prison corona would ironic replace people corona. fucking crazy. gotta wear mask, people mental gymnastics committed position want embarrassed Masks still needed vaccine. People need treat like fashion statement wear it. Oh okay actually agree then, think we're makes much difference. Sadly may start killing 1-2% infected hospital beds arent available. Stop. Lying. Considering vulnerable better 10% chance dying infected, vaccine would pretty bad....

For example, Minnesota almost 6000 positive tests 80, 1450 (approx) deaths.  free pick age risk reward crosses judgement.   

For example, 60 64 age group 7362 cases 133 deaths.  944 hospitalizatons 313 ICU admissions.  

Vaccine would pretty bad worse that.  Now, 25 might different. That's I'm getting commenter you. 

They said 10-15 mins contact puts high risk, think pretty much take bank number people infected. necessarily everyone. anxiety went reading this. sorry stuck living assholes. already taking them, might want ask doctor vitamin N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplements. There's downside taking vitamin people (but always ask doc first), studies linked adequate vitamin levels decreased susceptibility, less severe symptoms, less risk death covid. NAC may reduce risk catching covid well; catch it, studies show taking NAC onset symptoms may decrease risk hospitalization severity illness. Good luck you. kind stupid accusations happens every time disease response. actual disease response works differently movies. really, infants old enough drink/ party old enough live consequences thier actions. Sorry dealing morons. exactly problem? you’re happy choice, keep keeping on. Stop wasting energy worrying people doing. thing transmissible list flu people encouraged get vaccinated that, stay home it, etc.  reasons encouraged wear masks vaccine covid. Seems reasonable considering could possibly kill neighbor, coworker, etc. getting sick. hurt anyone suck french fries every day. hard understand people would feel strongly precautions transmissible illnesses ignored. Maybe need training even cleaner/janitor hospital surely? Theres hazardous biological waste disposal, proper sanitation sterilisation host things may aware hospital-specific. Trump knew too. Cause China told him. Yet nothing. Remember first amendment said right assemble shouldnt infringed?

People risky behavior continue act risky. Jesus look head Damn, two places alone ammountto cases deaths larger state california

With less testing none less “197 cases massive coronavirus outbreak ever”

Meanwhile USA 100,000 cases daily thousands people gathering rallies along Halloween parades little mask wearing. 

America fucking doomed never recover COVID point. haven’t even got winter yet. Winter coming.. isn't, Jimmy. isn't. sub filled self-loathing Americans spent past six months lauding Europe. Cut slack ha. Obesity. Like normal american Damn bet sick partys Today’s Wall Street Journal article long term effects Covid19, focuses LOT rapid heart rate thing describing. I’m sorry. hope recover well fully. can't serious  Daniel Andrews Mark McGowan elected King Queen new Kingdom Australia.

they work still apart problem start handing tickets- 1000$ every offense- resist dichotomy. first response: party getting shut NY due US elected officials caring science whatever. Even general obvious sides take, imposing polarity every last news item virus leads unhelpful discussion. Let's forget 100,000 excess deaths likely covid related, lack confirming test result. Essential Oil billion dollar multi layer marketing industry US. Look brand like Young Living, Doterra. usually sold new way living alternative modern medicine. even claimed essential oil could replace vaccine cure certain diseases. 

The people believe anti vaccine movement, would rely alternative, essential oil. 

I'd recommend documentary series Netflix, (Un)well. episode essential oil presented quite objectively informative. definitely incentive this, providing coronavirus test free, private business enough resources pull quickly thats goverment utilize resources infrastructure that, amassing size capacity much longer private business. want tell something? *Nobody* cares opinion! article says first wave vaccines looking reduce mild symptoms. trials designed determine reduced hospitalizations mortality rates. words, bait switch. Hate burst bubble due country would sensible person charge, actually need fellow Americans consideration others order beat pandemic.

This ""Your health responsibility"" mentality disease widespread country first place. needs change. Thank goodness country Canadian, I'm worried American friends well. eat mask

thatll show em get it, going subscribe 14 different news sites. ""reddit"" ...not monolithic hive mind.

TIL live opened schools. also surge. tracking cases schools doesn’t seem much spread schools themselves. cases outside brought course, within schools cases spread students. I’ve heard spread teachers actually. Although could school socializing. People wearing masks schools strict protocols. Schools open it’s definitely back normal there. look deaths per 100,000 70 get 10 countries: 
Andorra 
Bolivia  
Spain  
Brazil  
Chile  
Ecuador  
Mexico  
US  
UK  
Argentina  

Literally every country planet better that. better. UK too, fucking excuse us it. self flagellation. We're objectively shit performing far worse should. We're fully deserving criticism case everyone loves county happy that. supposed better be, ton r/coronavirus users Redditor Redditor B. guarantee that. Well, reality guidelines local federal case federal governments trying avoid culpability backlash....at least US, biggest problem. Keep passing line name local control coordination local leaders implement arbitrary guidelines please people rather address situation. one succeeds. Sure laws limit federal control federal authorities often circumvent compelling localities comply ways...admittedly, know little Spain's laws though said everyone carrier basically dead disease die agree. went Sam’s club Fountain Valley, CA first time since pandemic renew membership. saw handful shoppers take mask entered store. Never again, Costco shopping. get tested? Probably because, ""wearing masks sick people wearing one"" scenario, like T-shirt saying ""I SICK, STAY AWAY ELSE GET SICK TOO"" See? shit I’m talking about. I’ve seen several redditors trying justify lenient Halloween plans get upvoted. Fellow young folk: STOP. acting like parents isn’t good look. CFR going healthcare collapses far patients caregivers. We'll back 1918 standards care (or worse). That's matters. number number. rather wrong end this, learn regret quickly. chart says - stronger interventions stamp virus means better Fucking Utah County... Hell, stories big parties getting broken last night driving insane! people fucking dumb inconsiderate?! many people know. hits fan, believe actually true.. maybe neighbors, family, friends hiding out. Soros pays better ....and frog. Something trying avoid taxes house his, took toilets count residence that? Something along lines. know, basically worked system. Redditor person Redditor B different opinions, news 11. LMFAO dude that's hilarious. Good one. problematic well though? Telling people see one disastrous mental health. Jesus Christ, educate something!

The virus doesn’t fly fabric mask itself, it’s carried moisture droplets spray mouth/nose fine mist cough, sneeze, talk, breathe. mask stops large percentage moisture droplets (depending mask made of) don’t carry nearly far would .

Have ever covered mouth/nose sneeze? saliva snot hand afterwards?  
That’s mask stops, that’s carries virus.

[here’s picture believe science vs alternative facts, choose side, dealt since March. hear ya. mind mask personally. wish people without would stay fuck away me.

After 8 months, covid hit work place, watched one two people wearing mask 1 2 without masks. True, plenty people still don’t know important vitamin is, may deficient borderline deficient. really news know thing?  “He enemies, intensely disliked friends.” — Oscar Wilde someone El Paso. Ain't nobody even listening lol. places open packed. Gyms open well nail salons. proud fellow El Pasoans, close anymore. need feed families!!! sherriff department disgrace  Stores seem normalized differences sure. think people noticed there's fewer selections food companies focus producing best selling items only. I'm sure agree that. country massive different school set ups abilities. workable solution NYC isnt solution youd use rural Kentucky. likely bring skeptics, especially said vaccine alone bring back semblance normalcy. think taking approach Singapore organ transplants, organ donors priority non-donors makes sense. plenty resources isn’t issue, resources become constrained choose treating someone avoided infecting themselves/others another reckless think it’s fair prioritize health person prioritized health others. irrelevant. proper testing infrastructure would need able test entire region. financial incentive currently private business mandate region get tested was. proper infrastructure would need government backing enforcement seen countries like China Slovakia. Yeah theres going hierarchy gets first. Id like see

Healthcare workers

Emergency services

Food production handling (including grocery store workers)

Logistics (truckers)

Teachers school kids

Then work 1 year 1yr old 100yrs old supply allows. 

Its going take long time get everyone covered every 1% population help slow spread point. Again, science magic. seem basing movies there's know-it-all scientist. false. Medical science especially messy, since theoretical physics, real life messy. ruling alternative possibilities, experts means alternate possibilities. Also, nobody giving numbers often airborne transmission happening time. Science magic. complicated, always struggle move forward. I’m one spreading fake science trying cause needless sickness. Look mirror ask you’re body count worth it! high right way lower countries mentioned here. capacity testing US numbers would way different countries US would look like safe place. werent planted then, maybe wouldnt situation, weeks apart. would gotten rid covid continued ""lockdown"" time. Lets say get 50 cases. going indoors autumn bound spiral control, even cases sweep exponential growth would even harder ""i thought covid gone"".

It right kind reopen summer. atleast helped economy recover time. alternative would coordinated effort europe get rid virus mostly (like china). wasnt feasible.

The problem acting sooner autumn kicked preparing better. acting sooner atleast diffucult, 30 40 % european population doesnt seem give fuck. act early people dont see neccesity. hope moving forward, wearing mask sniffles socially acceptable. I'll sure let people last night, one nursing home nurse trauma center worker, know normal according people reddit 😂 happen. That's extremely unethical doctor agree you. Podcast, doctor Yale - wrote book: *Apollo’s Arrow:* *The Profound Enduring Impact Coronavirus Way Live.* full normal - means give COVID care (or lack thereof) ordinary flu, masks, social distancing, worries all. read book, talked it. initial vaccines (say 2nd Q 2021) likely effective, sample size small little experience COVID. roll planet earth - say everyone gets initial round immunization mid 2022. Well, everyone going accept initial vaccine (can blame them?) - say 50% effective. still need vigilant, wait better round vaccines. Well, that's another year development, testing, another year rollout. thing us long time, irrespective political leaders saying, idea scientists. total cases Yeah think looks fine photo. fine mean looks like normally does... like somebody waking morning hell bender pub wearing skin somebody met along way. Poster said right leaning *counties* states.

NYC uptick, nothing like places seeing. Yeah know! Amazing. got back running maybe past month.

It's slow progress. notice resting heart rate seem lower.

I still increase stamina endurance gonna keep taking time it.  agree! I'm both-sides-ing far blame goes either pandemic's toll talk it. miss earlier days sub I'd actually learn challenged comments. anymore. No. need stay home. Thanks contributing *thoughful* opinion TED talk! let's take quick poll see cares! Wait... one?!!! Even receiving vaccine one else wants follow same, burdensome precautions year? could known?! mean way MCG acts surprised lol Sorry loss mean places like Belgium Spain France high mask usage rates well.. would fair punishment think important consider balance collateral damage implementing drastic policies. area, everyone screams need wuhan style lockdown. even mention pros/cons, get labeled grandma killer. 

I understand easy answer. But, population incapable rational discussion original thought...it starts worry me. thing hear people saying, parroted media catch phrases, worries me. think media consumption w/ 24/7 covid numbers repetition covid terminology: wear mask, together, stay home, stay safe, surge, etc started brainwash people. long everyone gets chance vote, even Republicans. need consequences. Would rather innocent bear them? Dunno, certainly realized 10th irl friend blocked creating r/Masks4All 5th threat it. almost ""reddit"" millions different people different opinions things, monolithic hive mind. doubt, long majority right thing time, able keep Reff 1, means control may eventually disappear.


I plan wear mask foreseeable future, started wearing May... copping smart arse comments shops obvious intellects somehow offending 🙄  millions would die healthcare systems would collapse Seems bit excessive, especially outside socially distanced. aren’t Sunday numbers often reported? don’t understand possible!! don’t even necessarily blame people it, it’s like live different planet. El Paso Houston 740 miles apart. sure what's going burbs rural Illinois.

I visited relatives Southern Illinois. listen nephews lecture how:

1. blown proportion. 

2. apparently living fear take mask wearing seriously. 

3. need stop 'starting shit' responding them.


If worst happens making trip back funerals. Also amount Trump flags vote tax amendment signs truly amazing. filled self-loathing Americans spent past six months insisting Europe gotten Covid control. find stupid go shopping store without mask, people fucking disgusting. I’m El Paso think definitely lack social distancing. lot families keep visiting throwing parties/barbecues. it’s something specific El Paso, might culture big large families family-wide activities. People used family gatherings every week, they’re struggling keep social gathering stamina. Utah tried that. ""freedom loving"" friends area bitched social media, text alert ""inaccurate fear-mongering."" remember reading case China woman found still spread virus many months.

Kinda childish received 4 votes one single honest answer possible. local hospital (Missouri) installed mobile trailers parking lot expand we’re capacity. !RemindMe 2 weeks ""are numbers showing party?"" literally even defending it, I'm fuckign sorry bit think lie? 

The part killing lockdown ruined life generations Britons forever lost lockdowns. know... entire post. Snow birds.... year... (just attempt humor) Strange see comments great idea. test sensitive PCR tests give everyone less stressful flight knowing one one test positive past 4 hours flight. aligator man.. someone rides motorcycle helmetless deserve it? long-time smoker deserve it? skier fails avoid tree deserve it?

No matter life choices, need ICU bed, get it. No. It’s actual number. shouldn’t limiting tests symptomatic people. fair also close done Victoria (AU). required quarantine dont hefty fine breaching public health order. butt load breaches early lifted fine lifted checks enforcement measures (such stricter lockdown). Still took get side looks like now. ""I like America"" much ask people go ONE Halloween without anything?? Maybe two need be. They'll plenty chances go Halloween party lifetime. Biden wins Florida Texas, Tuesday night. not, expect end Wednesday night give us complete picture surprised turns Thursday. Yep Weird timing post sensation untrue article like this, wonder election something important going trying influence? live Missouri, currently experiencing intense increase cases.

Thanks clarification!  see that. reacting directly cutting people certain BMI age without form gradient factors. read Federalist? Honestly, feel sorry anything. family members completely conspiracy rabbit hole it’s sad watch. actually lucky SARS Ebola non infectious incubation period. Remember actually rare thing virus non infectious incubation period. main reason makes viruses hard contain even without infectious incubation period still ridiculously hard contain.

This coronavirus may give us great wake call prevent prepare us something much worse. also might opposite effect ""well, dealt viruses always fine, lock needed, let's continue letting planes fly around globe"" begins devastate country shut late. Sure let’s let Big Brother weld us homes! 100% agree. take note; Joe Lunchboxes like me, everything, *including expert opinion* random posts internet. credibility experts experts need identified agreed authority figures. reason, probably related corporate profits shoring dollar, authority figures declined hold support expert opinion. Basic critical thinking skills may able overcome propaganda. Oh, well answer question none 15 minutes thing standard set contract tracers focus efforts efficient way enough manpower trace *every* lead.

It nothing virus transmits. could briefly walk past someone sneezes get it. live near lake ozarks (the town/lake show Ozark based on) headline reminds headlines whole country seeing massive lake ozarks parties last months. place teeming rednecks conservatives, hardly anybody believes virus. local Facebook groups filled posts “plandemic” can’t “live fear” various justifications jam-packed bars restaurants water huge swim bar parties took place summer. Fine Hmm, even Germany, hailed responsible, using lockdown set-up envied track trace system, currently dealing soaring cases.

It's hard shake feeling outlying cases (two isolated islands, authoritarian regime), nigh-on impossible stop thing. based something like ""useful life years remaining"" something recall worded. countries march reports similar first one 80 admitted ICU, 75, 70 situation got worse. Bye Felicia. testing people symptoms?

Deathpanels supposed Obama's fault better UK that's saying much. worried second - thought meant 7 local cases would huge increase we've seeing recently - single local case 6 imported ones. Definitely success. didn’t crash whole Economy like countries did. People getting together all. I'm sorry country allowed virus spread unchecked population. However, groups meeting together party moment regardless size irresponsible undeniably part problem.

Its situation back March, remember ""stop spread"" ""stay home"" posts social media. Except, things United States immeasurably worse March. gone trick treating, participated parties (of size) travelled non-essential reasons PART PROBLEM!

The fact getting upvoted defending people party USA 100,000 new cases 24 hours also indicative state America.

Again, empathise people suffering, feeling lonely, depressed isolated. However good society, sometimes sacrifices made and, believe, noble sacrifice. people gone out, gathered groups needlessly careless midst worst pandemic hundred years know appreciated. Halloween stressful day me, trying desperately disappoint kids. “trick treated” grandparents front yard. already set candy kids least 15-20 feet away masks on. neighborhood several households setting tables goody bags. drove us around found three tables people either inside way porch table end driveway. early kids out, considered safe enough. wiped everything washed hands candy consumption. 

What killed tables pass idiots put table out, sat right beside without masks expecting kids still come get candy them. completely defeated purpose setting station away house.  Oh used faint sight blood child haha. thankfully. Yeh I'm thinking short UK markets entirely naked tomorrow; could possibly go wrong shitstorm brewing weeks months ahead thought meant hantavirus googling. thanks teaching virus heard of! No, thank, you. Recently? I’ll say Halloween parties . work lab. Samples drug product shipped dry ice time.

Liberia also war torn general, punctuated brief periods relative peace. impressive indeed. thats weird. symptoms described, test negative.....

or it? Guess never know sure since hospital tested once. That’s true. Proven fact! There’s two ways wearing mask. right wrong way. say true would first responders bother using them!? wont holding breath...   Wouldn’t people normally wear mask Halloween party? guess masks fashion? doesn’t highlight certain someone’s ineptitude. He's done fantastic job weakening Britain even audacity say annoyed COVID talk

""They come CU party. known come for,"" Jenny Robertson, longtime Boulder County resident. ""With COVID, think young going catch going give people.""

As state sees record single-day coronavirus infections, CU continues crack off-campus parties. Boulder County Health placed several residences mandatory quarantine breaking social distancing rules. 

""In college environment think comes someone’s feeling personal responsibility,"" said one college student. 

Police Boulder said refer citations off-campus parties school consequences. 

***CORRECTION:*** *Denver7 previously reported CU Boulder placed several residences mandatory quarantine. fact, county agency placed residences quarantine. regret error.* Per capita it’s much different America. USA higher spring likely higher per capita weeks. Masks *won't* needed post-vaccine, would surprised continue used post-pandemic. get sick going forward, I'll probably wearing mask around people. Bruh mask lowers risk transferring virus someone else, doesn’t protect u getting all. thought everyone knew now? It’s sad hear health care professionals this. knew one unfollow Facebook seeing countless irresponsible things doing. Control message, needed False dichotomy, enough board certified internists (who specialists now) figure without guy never even real intern year fucking vent exploding lungs. Nice try though? Dude North Korea taken build North Korea sounds like syncope. get nearly exact set symptoms everytime needle breaks skin. imagine, neither recent MRI spinal tap much fun lmao That's logical. Sometimes downvotes mean nothing all. true. could build temp hospitals staff 3rd 4th year med students. wonder I’ve first ever psoriatic episode... fuck, thing triggers autoimmune diseases, many people going world trouble. feel like probably fair election given happened civil war regardless Liberia country African continent handling pandemic well. I'm sure could learn something one them. heard they're well. pretty much scenario well... 2 kids, 3rd grade 1st grade... end last year year virtual, great. But, us working home help keep track. 

With said, also know fact kids classes attended year... that's troubling, far over. hate pandemic me. feel like I’m one family genuine concerns it. found aunt (who host Thanksgiving) eating inside restaurants regular husband. don’t want mom immediate family go (the hosts) don’t take Covid test, feel definitely cause lot tension. I’m willing bad guy take heat it, long everyone gets tested Covid Thanksgiving Neither strictly mutually exclusive child. actually need fellow Americans consideration others order beat pandemic.

The *average* amount empathy consideration others citizens US must increase, yes. many ways that. me, that’s insane amount people even without pandemic happening! said BLM protestors Personally get tunnel vision nearly every time stand sitting (along raised heart rate), toes go reddish purple colour whenever even slightly cold. rarely though, sometimes experience strong sensation seems trigger sorts weird symptoms. Usually starts tunnel vision light-headedness, I'll go cold sweat, nausea, fast heart rate shallow breathing, along feeling super weak. Last time happened gig suddenly really painful hiccup nowhere immediately felt like going pass out. lie smoking area sweat like pig (which pretty embarrassing lmao). Another time happened coming freezing winter cold warm room. body weird. think might never actually real party guys. :( drag Straw man argument, great do, way managing ARDS definitely smart dumb ways deer season year... almost everyone dumb way go deer camp get proper drunk deer. GO JAGS! Probably around thanksgiving they’ll surrounded family members get death toll numbers nice proper like.  first sentence point. headline makes sound like spooky mystery, it’s people aren’t sure exactly moment caught exactly caught from. accurate headline would “Contact tracing increasingly unrealistic COVID community spread broadens” something like that. 

The lady says works home kids school online speculates caught Covid apple grocery store. key went grocery store masks distancing help aren’t perfect. common people opt organ donation?

Would accurate say drop bottom list opt out? Oh noooo... one incompetent health officials exposed. UN replace guy someone shred integrity? Reminder willful ignorance becomes neglect *people start dying*.

Just wait people start pleading 5th asked contact tracing information. well, is, obviously choice chosen dang, need go parties wearing mask since March, still works great preventing infection. Smartarded live right Naperville Aurora line. see lot people chin diapers go Jewel Costco. vaccine doesnt work, what's point trying, cant live like forever. Well, Liberia isn’t world tourist destination...I’ve never heard anyone saying “man fuckin PSYCHED holiday vacation LIBERIA!” Yeah, people taking pretty seriously NYC. We’ve trying resume modicum normal life virus levels dropped around city summer, coming back people getting ready lock again. It’s starting feel inevitable point. Give us treatment care president, fucking fucks I've wondered would like thing mutated started killing mostly 'young/healthy' people 20's 30's sparing older people, much like 1918 pandemic.

Attitudes young would change course.. would right expect better treatment fellow, older humans treating them? Nope. Obviously I'd go feel like I’m losing humanity sometimes want selfish people get badly bc actually deserve it. feel like monster thinking goddamn feels horrible see shitting everyone else’s safeness fun hours. many stupid people latch onto ""chance"" use justify wearing mask washing hands social distancing, thus spreading even more. Like now. Yeah, really helping comments. Keep up. dropping hot truth making significant change even calling real asshole. right now? intentions, please tell me? seems want feel worse, thought giving wanted. want, really? Sing again! Heck *yeah* did! show went shit Grow up. absolutely idea viral load person next to, absolutely zero grounds make statement “it’s simple catch people think”. 

There’s plenty data proving statement completely wrong. 

Are capable understanding personal experience doesn’t define experience anyone else, nahhh... America literally time, case special? Got lucky twice seems. I'm betting 200k day record. Watch. Bro ill help u put tree   No, lie desperate man throw food blender serve straw. terrifying! positve Covid back 7th back backs tests. mild symptoms, 10 days extra 12 sure associate longterm symptoms like racing heart beat fatigue. Im 26 currently uninsured trying get coverage. super worrying Im scared. recently, heartburn frequently, something didnt experience pre-covid. depressed mood. Im behind work school finishing degree motivation continue think avoiding getting sick. really hard deal with. wearing masks? boyfriend mono assumed already kept kissing sick, never got either Victorian fine breaching quarantine $5000. It’s nothing compared Canada fined $750,000 breaching quarantine order. (And six months prison.) Indeed, regime universal deceit, truth tellers considered traitors. Exactly, get risk people healthcare workers back normal fast shit Good luck arresting all. Assuming vaccine available, percentage population going absolutely freak learn still keep wearing facial coverings maintain social distancing even they've vaccinated.

A certain US president oversold magic bullet, oversold pretty much everything else life. opponent winner, language around world would far measured, would sense competing US inflating expectations magic elixir. Go live life love God take damn mask, y'all look ridiculous. Like literally spreading virus around country speak? Yeah fuck business owners potentially facing poverty.


Y’all problem hanging us dry 1 year definitions would longer considered acute, chronic. condition lasting longer six months usually considered chronic. Chin diapers don’t count wearing mask. advice? confused

Edit: Okay? never offered advice... ""In email Banner Health employees Friday, chief clinical officer Dr. Marjorie Bessel explained that, request Banner health care systems, Arizona Department Health Services activated crisis standards June 29 “for first time state’s history first time state done country.”

that article dated first week july Lol edit comment backfires think shown growing individualism

Indeed. Western folks seem want live though island, nobody truly. kind sad really. might well apply job I'd say. kudos wanting help whatever way can, that's great attitude wish people running things thought way. Don’t sit. Go walks, pill-free depression cure. That's disgraceful. hope communicate boss. ring bell victim would take 2 1/2 days ringing every second. Compare hour victims 9/11 we've spent day remembrance every year past 19 years. York fact $1000 fines exact offenses, like non-felony crime New York enforced. Utah'n Utahns, Utah'n Utahns Utah'n, Utah'n Utah'n Utahns 'n Utah. Good God y'all! Yeah. governor tried institute stay home order, mask mandate, reducing capacity bars/restaurants 25%. He's sued every step.

Alcohol huge part WI culture bars huge part economy. snowmobile trails lead one another.

The way ever going work money people actually stay home. happen. combine culture political divide masks (which dumb) recipe disaster.

Either gathering places communities close people work. people risk get sick COVID. lot places, literally good choice. 

This proves infrastructure/safety nets there. number people living paycheck paycheck, hard around.

I'm defending anti-maskers. wear one rare occasion I'm public - every two weeks grocery store. I'm privileged job (and partner's) translated well working home. afford buy two weeks groceries. like enough five us tiny house, plus dog, completely maddening. healthcare access need to.

So hate seeing pictures people bars, holding large weddings, parties, feel whose livelihoods depend industry. Trump office. Nice! That's expectation; that's minimum target effectiveness get approval (or, noted comment, old minimum effectiveness target). vaccine makers expecting higher target. Ah, Americans. said UK. cases looking worse even March government's hand forced. US probably start setting field hospitals again. Death number 1968 estimate. learned, post event estimates always far higher recorded number time. 

Comparing recorded deaths estimated deaths apples oranges comparison. got failed it’s flu argument, thought realized inherently flawed was. 

Deaths Covid happened despite restrictions. Imagine bad things would still packed concerts, packed sporting events, packed churches, packed transit, packed restaurants bars, etc., masks, social distancing.  

Your bronalysis is, I’m afraid, bronalysis. least didn’t resort conspiracy theories that’s plus side. meant deal this

Why not? New diseases, new viruses, something living species deal with. Even conventional bananas face threatening wipe out.

We species survived millions years evolution dealt worse diseases less science capability this. Humans either deal don't, ""meant"" it. Yeah it’s totally normal hospitals 100% Yes. Even one nobody would follow I'm sick narrative. Look Spain, look France, look Belgium. Even Portugal. spiking Europe places never really significant anti-masker movement. So, despite people sub want like believe, masks invincible shields disease. no, I'm anti - masker looking stats can't even argue masks stop exponential growth. Yes, extremely useful indoor places little air circulation silver bullet people say even argue vast majority people see alternative social distancing instead complement it, engaging riskier behavior. Jesus Christ dude. Hateful people like make ashamed live country. Wel. chance catching China’s 100s time less American. detected cases test millions people.  

So don’t blame want avoid virus.   political draconian laws may fun though. antigen tests, PCR, no, capacity suddenly pop up. tests ones take 20 minutes each. 
Also medics work hospitals, fact, don't. work clinics normally operate weekends. also they're nurses. **Short answer**: Preferably higher 0.1% ~ ( 2009 pandemic flu, seasonal influenza etc) ***complicated***.

**Long answer**: feel loaded question, account hospital capacity, infectious disease is, rate hospitalization, treatment needed, disruptive disease is, spreads disease control measures. 

Case point, country (Singapore) experience numerous infectious diseases, much higher mortality rate, like SARS (10%), Nipah Virus (50% +) Dengue Fever, experience spread never lockdown, spread rapidly current virus hence chance overwhelming healthcare system low normal measures worked. fact, current Dengue Fever much higher fatality rate moment, effective treatment manage spread better.

Next, deadly previous cousins (MERS, SARS etc), COVID 19 significant rate hospitalization (15 20%) might sound lot spread fast effective, numbers add really fast. Making disruptive functioning society cousins, since infected typically sick go work move far, making spread much contain.

I believe lockdowns necessary, last resort situations. lockdown previous disease control measures (temperature screening, social distance, stay home feel ill etc) enough stop spread, discovered days unable trace cases discovered massive clusters. Lmao you’re right, that’s totally torrent. Man make excellent case study years sub ever excavated Since murdering people enabler? Nobody bought first time, we're conversation Halloween. doctor used work called ""organ donors wheels.""

If someone dumb enough wear helmet motorcycle, go it. matter health. 90% people rural town wearing masks, definitely impacts right angry. feel u dont really want likely Average positive last 7 days testing. boyfriend sex day became symptomatic tested positive couple days later. tested day test negative. quarantined got tested week first test. Still negative. think got lucky. People find like functional intensive care units parents gravely ill even know said could advice case. asked banned that's referring to. saying rhetorically. I'm leaving volition visit sub directly look headlines. Everyone started asshole acting like defending party (I wasn't) started replying messages several times. patience worn heart. I'm jsut fucking broken. made mistake, I'm fucking sorry. I'm pretty sure joking. Sigh... longer doubt going drag years.  TSA people taken separate rooms cavity searches reason believe one needed. It’s standard means though. idea. think worst-case scenario end vaccine degree efficacy even matter bunch dumbasses get it.

Doesn't matter 50% 80% effective glue-sniffers America go get damn thing. Last months? Utah County mosy insane place planet least last 30 years Breaking state wide mandate wear masks socially distancing? Breaking state mandate limiting indoor congregation? news you? Pre-covid big(gest) parties city easily 2000-3000 people. full triage mode arizona several weeks huge numbers high percent positive. get chance google plan sometime, i'd hate doctor decide based checklist whether treat someone send home die.

It looks like activated plan, doesnt look like actually needed? Seriously, cousin friends ride Ubers without masks on, drunk hell. driver deserve stay healthy can't afford stupid Nope. Wbu virus really kicking humanity’s collective ass. Exactly nope like past like April according ppl Sounds like they're going clog jails soon, maybe arrests would enough get word out. saying would sit back chill 2 weeks go lives? buying one again. “Covid Normal” Victoria wants achieve. basically means there’s community transmission, remain alert. kidding! missed old friend’s wedding yesterday Oh, that’s cool didn’t know that. Though referring organ donor die use organs. way you’re top list heart without donate heart previously (because can’t). believe donor also something opt Singapore, rather opt-in countries. here. people know taking anywhere near seriously should, far none gotten infected (unless asymptomatic mildly symptomatic never even thought getting tested). Obviously virus spreading people catching it. weird one person know several people infected another person know any. See, hoping ""Plague Doctor"" going preferred costume year. Yet 1000’s ate showing political rallys! fuckin backwards Anerica get? leaker need advise Snowden soon  Cops across nation need cruise Facebook issue tickets. Would solve two problems once. toxic maybe take advice. sheriff River Falls, WI, Nancy Hove, ran unopposed 2018. day election, guy started putting signs asking people write name in. even remember name, think signs photos wife separate boxes.  Thank you! Wish best, think everyone needs bit empathy especially times :)) Hey man makes feel better almost everyone know weak spots covid game right now. friend's mom literally someone's house day, inside, mask, etc. Guy ended testing positive, waiting test. mostly behaving fine otherwise. think pandemic fatigue setting in.

I think there's nothing wrong wrong, especially comes politics. virus extremely unforgiving though. Still sad lapse judgement may cost grandfather life. But, pandemic far over, there's strong chance may caught road even 99.99% everything right. I'd say proud one's nation exactly common thing times changed. world become much globalized, regardless policy. internet main driver that. TV well. totally understandable feel direct pride happiness linked nation. ""dumb american"" vitriolic statement use. seeming American, way either self-loathing mean towards individual. HIV airborne, see reason feasible, could killed 1/3 world's population easily . Yes no. objectively capture people positive. important helps us figure much problem asymptomatic people are. Symptomatic people easy seek care get tested. Asymptomatic people obviously reason seek care surveillance testing important.

If country well, number cases rise increased testing. new cases increasing rate far higher increase tests. That’s big problem indicative surge cases. respect - say no. Taking stand might least convince people. anxiety feel know safe. Cant speak anyone id much prefer shave decade plus life kneecap quality. flattening curve doesnt much that. Right? I'm teacher, enforce mask wearing law enforcement. And, we're good job enforcing schools, data showing spreading schools, rather, spreading activities outside school. Haha even name says all, you’re powerful actually you? You’re deeply unhappy unfulfilled person wishing harm others bring harm yourself. hope energy comes back twofold- guess decide type energy sorry loss. heart aches everyone position family. sacrificed much continue so. either. disgusting habit needs end. Okay something get money short term hurt health cripple department long run, would smart dumb? know nurse antivax... Yeah like, probably don’t want risk sick weeks risk long-term autoimmune disorders roll dice “probably won’t die” order die Exactly Well sort bioengineering least. thinking sort algae takes CO2. think go Moon, way take carbon atmosphere. 

In meantime, try use little fossil fuels possible. White Florida, said entire world (but especially US). link jive assertion. link discusses new data aggregation tool implemented CDC. avoid situation first place? Block FB one’s asking suffer silence. never did. again, stop putting words mouth.
 
No one’s depriving food shelter you’re minority. Stop making comparison. stop thinking streets elitists—they’ve got lose economic downturn realized they’re screwed government inaction. One major reason protests large they’re working. realize this? report publicly trying Trump -- panic nation -- LOL. want start tackling spam/low effort posts... effective problems target. least videos contain information people actually pay attention to, said threads here. Nobody going stop eating fuddruckers, OK? ok. Ah yes, 33,000 people would died every single American caught virus? We’re 230k it’s even year. IFR agreed somewhere .5% 1% expect herd immunity take place (provided antibodies don’t fade) would need 70% become infected. That’s 1,155,000 2,310,000 deaths don’t find vaccine.

I understand you’re full theories thoughts numbers you’ll believe want believe. didn’t post you. posted everyone needs see current percentage looks like real, actual numbers.

And, I’ve got awful enough headache polite normal, anyone wants argue I’m fear-mongering want us lockdown forever despite fact people die everyday, know ship sailed. didn’t properly first time even states control looking steep spikes chance population another lockdown. multiple safety precautions individuals take protect one another, posted place, talked news, easily accessible health related website including CDC local health authorities. Anyone claims following safety guidelines potentially save million lives living fear—you’re brave. You’re selfish. isn’t all. It’s protecting lives potentially 2 million people saving 10 million chronic illness doesn’t really matter whether folks vote red, vote blue, resident aliens undocumented immigrants. human lives going Halloween party small sacrifice make protect human life. Right now, whether know not, safety high risk loved ones rests shoulders strangers may may decided right party make-out drunk full moon Halloween night important loved one’s life. Dare stupid Schengen suspended long deemed necessary. border closed, cars crossing - need worry quarantine.

Closing border essential getting daily infection rate single digits even zero summer live. Reopening led drastically higher rates now. Thank you. actually ended online chat too, thing happened. Moab weeks ago fall break. went enjoy off-road trails, took groceries enjoy hotel room, ordered food favorite restaurants. town, observed hardly anyone masked up, walking big groups main street, restaurants ordered form socially distanced tables dining areas. Pretty much knew we'd hit 2k last week based fall break. makes think Biden sweep mean instant lockdowns lot places o_0 Agreed. People vaping smoking irresponsible well. Even Europeans disagree you...lmfao

* [3 Times Many Europeans Move US, Way - probably met elsewhere - /s Fucking Americans swear god ... sounds pretty damn accurate. Sadly. Good point. People really need chill stop stupid already money. Hahahaha stubborn want admit objectively wrong something wish death 🤣

Cheers covid free city 2 close organized Facebook instagram- organized happily bragging got reduced pricing shared page thousands people events... planning new years party. rough “will swamp”, “is swamping”. anyone getting sued Sherrif department. join lawsuit, cant enforce opinions smh teach north end county, pretty much exact thing are. [Heart injury observed 62.3% COVID-19 patients, heart structural abnormalities present nearly two-thirds patients underwent echocardiogram test. In-hospital mortality rate patients anyone came across article read actually says: heart injury observed 62.3% people tested DOCTORS SUSPECTED HEART DAMAGE. 
It random sample mean 62.3% people get covid-19 get heart injury. 
It's extremely misleading title probably breaks every subreddit's rule causing fear people read beyond headlines. crazy thing actually stood lead country pandemic everything possible fight it, would lot people voting may otherwise. think saw pandemic threat presidency played start, ironically, done opposite may given huge advantage. actually shut mask mandate Good ole new york huh. know like blame karens breaking basic rules, NY fucked majorly here. responsible would making first place really know her. bought N95 mask, gave hospital.  (Because told take them).

We thin medical masks thick cotton one. wear every time leave house. responsibility every American acts will, President Trump. spread misinformation ""doesn't spread easily people think""
. spread easily, spread every single time. due trial protocols set readout target based total number confirmed cases within entire trial group, vaccine control.

That feels like silly protocol. would leave threshold number control infections mean approve vaccine protocol. hit threshold hit total number confirmed cases, plausible scenario approve. things matter, relatively short hard lockdowns work saving economy saving lives. perfect balance. People interest literal life fool. don’t think you’re going die still goals interest. 12? understand politics? wait later vape situation like that? suckretary skip bill rally even  don’t recommend smoking either. Actually, fully expect ex-President Trump use last 3 months office launch barrage lawsuits election, time using social media presence encourage people disobey orders given social distance. entire time office cause much chaos possible US, expectation last 3 months office different. Unfortunately I'm you- news local pages 2 parties less 20 miles house, almost one wearing masks, 2,000 people. event page one said 10,000 one point... we're Utah, exactly farm country anymore like we're bustling population. Forking Curts vast, vast majority get sick need care all. That’s opinion compared fact though That's relevant peopke getting tested 3 days traveling *into* New York though, talking about. There’s SAFETY NET OFFERED. according suffer silence.

Economic survival part civil rights. Unless able food shelter basic survival NEEDS isn’t considered part civil rights? 

What arguing people supportive large gatherings protests time advocating extended lockdowns condemning protests againist them. Claiming us accept forced poverty given government 

Fuck elitist pieces shit act survival trivial matter facing loss livelihood small inconvenience time justifying risking Covid personal interests.

You go protest believe risk Covid I’m supposed go poverty won’t put risk... economic interests big deal don’t stop collecting checks unable pay bills tell survival isn’t big deal  Yanks struggling cope fact covid getting worse meanwhile going away countries sooo fucking funny fuck breaking state law crime? Yeah make good point. could picked party bring home spread families. Might even visit grandparents elderly relatives. lockdown model works, learn grow accept maybe save grandma. They're probably masks worn trump rally something it.  
I suggest voting Nobody, he's best.

Nobody tells truth. 
Nobody listens you. 
Nobody cares you. 
Nobody keeps promises. 
Nobody deserves trust. manipulative. one knows yet effective vaccines are, officials keep trying create expectation moderate efficacy: high enough people take vaccine, low enough keep taking precautions people vaccinated. dying self interests? Lol aren’t getting? sheriff? That’s what’s really scary - 3 months change White House votes go way. US really bad position virus leading winter president continuously says it’s going go away may also care even less he’s voted out. Australia election next PM sworn quickly (around 10 days). vaccine plus rapid testing open borders. much ""can"" translate likely, chance happening, logistically speaking? Hi there, already posted Reposts removed feel sorry genuinely, must suck come excuses justify fellow countrymen contributing making pandemic worse. Yep Hi there, already posted Reposts removed think 24 fever enough assume covid. Technically possible, far likely something else. I'd assume people social bars end day, yeah something I'd really throw list worrisome activities people fall all. Good grief! Canada play I've read sources Spanish flu actually much deadly- behavior different then. Less handwashing, less knowledge healthcare human body, sanitation worse, etc- know true is, certainly fair say cant make straight mortality comparisons across board. towns went strict quarantine and/or isolation Spanish flu came phenomenally better results rest world general, though keeping people separated admittedly easier. Thank you. means lot people looking Europe getting owned second much worse wave. also kinds people tell europe racist towards Asians Asians States smarter people European nations lol schools remain open?  Actually wondering too, lol. shooting head doesn’t always result death. don’t recommend it.  Yeah summer come it'll go away /s trying slow enough hospitals cope. long treat need death rate stay they/the people feel acceptable.... thats guess anyway. would amazing though. Keep locked entire month though Wtf Seeking PTO funds officers COVID interest. high? READING COMPREHENSION lol. slow? get time sick officers play politics people wear masks. wants WAYS. need use smaller words you? You’re telling know “these people” degenerates get alcohol poisoning every weekend....because four-sentence article Halloween party? Alrighty then. Church street literally filled thousands people walking shoulder shoulder. reminded bourbon street looks like Mardi Gras. I’d say 15% people wearing masks. keep trying smear campaigns Labor keep failing, suck Murdoch media. Well, quite bit Putin's DNA. Exactly. used often winter. Hope leaks keep coming.  Here, take this. 

*gives Hubble telescope* then? Somewhere better Australia? voanews? lol make convincing points. Particularly #2 true. think strong evidence many infected US point Europe. Nowhere near herd immunity threshold, even 5% infected least 5% lower spread (we assume) 5% fewer people going need hospital beds. Mass graves Yup. face always coupled ""WHO"" instead Tedros. also live UK would disagree. live (our interest)

I’m North regularly see folk without them. Number positive results per 100k per week good metric combined positivity rate. jump bridge.... nothing debate.  empirical evidence work.  empirical evidence proving effective? any? sit shut fuck up.  Every state capability become Florida, needs little ~~meth~~ push all. saw article yesterday (the economist?), found unconvincing without data. hard-hit cities still 0.25% population tested positive second wave, others 0.75%. Maybe much variation two places, lot people died throughout Lombardy 0.25% still pretty indicative lot spread.

There's lot places Lombardy 1% population died first wave. would expect cases spread second wave.

But full data given (cases individual towns, even rate growth), able find any. got anything it?  Hahaha righto mate.

The debate boiled one economy. schools closed meant kids st home parents stay home work look them. wheb dissolve schools, younger grades last. wrong two levels. Great chat.   palestinians Nobody said vaccines well sure day prevent getting case virus know vaccine lower severity lessen serious complications eventually okay. mutation predominated Bergamo, Madrid, Paris, Belgium, UK NYC April. would say problem (for Houston too).  covid analogy like use grocery stores.

Passing someone isle, contact, seconds, sure less 6 feet away. Low risk. contact.

Standing next someone else waiting line, might minutes, hopefully 6 feet away, sometimes closer. Still pretty low risk. contact.

Checking cashier, usually partition cahier, usually less 15 minutes, sure less 6 feet physical distance away. Plus probably touch groceries. bit bigger risk, 8 hour shift, much bigger risk coworkers. Still technical contact.

Going grocery store someone outside household? Absolute contact.

If people sneeze couch you, that's contact. call Algernon? normally overflow unit extra staff time it. day worked first day capacity past month ( think 2 empty beds). Follow money.... Learning from, experience first hand two different things. Yes pay ep salary anymore taxes! That's pretty much positive thing coming it! protest/riot Trump made pandemic political day one.  fuck anyone Trump administration RT first place? people questioning that? everything pandemic especially regards total lack US federal response pandemic. numbers continue, won’t need many vaccines 😬 could avoided close churches time being?

The fact taxpayer-funded tv channel Poland acts propaganda government embarrassing makes look like Banana republic. Poland look Western countries ways improve. Yeah sit deep hole way come dig deeper maybe come side world. know from, understanding many countries Europe, flu vaccine recommended/offered sensitive groups like elderly immunocompromised individuals. example, [this reported city (Berlin) offering everyone. head /r/askeurope search old threads flu vaccine, see approach fairly common. different U.S. said, I'd surprised dedicated person get wanted go way make happen. Fear
Mongering

That's doing. Mortality rates steadily declining we're finding treat it. Stop saying bullshit. like smallpox, right?  see first comment fooling anyone. literally said antimask idiots catch virus. Maybe go break moronic trump rallies. getting downvoted right left back April May suggesting real economic cost could end mass disability well future potentially millions survivors disease, rather temporary economic shut down. called ""fearmonger"" stating something that, me, simply logical consideration based evidence needed acknowledged. day still run people refuse acknowledge real thing.  asymptomatic unlikely issues. 

Generally long term issues occur moderate covid cases worse. Except hardest hit cities Lombardy (Bergamo) actually relatively ok. ones hit hard (Milan) struggling. basically, learning read technically pretty easy, learning spell million exceptions hard. diagnosed Ulcerative colitis late last year.. makes wonder covid could circulating sooner cause mine really was. explain continual presence Russian oligarchs Trump's business dealings literally decades? Explain many Trump administration close ties various unsavory Russians directly implicated federal crimes US? fuck Trump regular contact Putin? Trump nothing Russian bounties military? almost every single foreign policy decision could effect Russia benefit? wearing masks prioritized. Trump cult members wait. Simple. article:

Thats fault authorities supporting people Lockdown. source, 5 months outdated, says France, Germany, US similar rates wearing masks ~75%. think 3/4 Americans wearing masks. Make brother see parents outside front lawn explain *how* thinks even *think* letting house he's convincing enough.

Narrator: wasn't.

I started getting (relatively) closer parents 1st November (possibly) get away I'm Sydney, Australia. death rate incredibly low, hard see stats think ""this scary"" Sweden didn’t herd immunity either trying clarify crystalize statement. want make sure understand mean imply.

Endocrine Society: 
""to guarantee sufficiency, recommend 40 60 ng/mL""

..

According Endocrine Society achieve serum 25(OH)D level 75nmol/L (30ng/mL) requires Vitamin intake 37.5– 50µg/day
(1500–2000IU/day) adults.

However, “in 2011, respected Endocrine Society issued report urging much, much higher minimum blood level vitamin D. time, experts concluded: “Based evidence, minimum, recommend vitamin levels 30 ng/mL, vagaries assays, guarantee sufficiency, recommend 40 60 ng/mL children article (from April really, still know goverment said next time propably cancelled work health care mean lol? jannie Nah man, eventually everyone can't handle dead!.. mean fuck right?! Slightly? 

I call thousands people dying slightly higher dying rate. almost he's foreign paid instigator designed cause societal rifts western democracy. 100% false.  Asymptomatic cases direct result mask usage reduces viral loads severity infection.  numerous peer reviewed studies proven multiple times. know pretty fucked up. enough. interesting. download app. Also, schools universities staying open. understand schools are, tough choice, universities? agree, certainly factor, still explain Belgium recorded almost 5 times many COVID-19 deaths per capita Slovakia case counts much higher. That's really serious. should, already, get heart check make sure nothing bad happened this. many cases permanent, undetected heart damage. woods. ""A small growing body evidence shows COVID-19 damage heart, sometimes fatally, even previously healthy young athlete. "" Err side caution. Go see cardiologist, show him/her articles tell make sure 100% feel. Please. Anyone actually fined. Hot damn. US never getting mess. yeah sure... sure China bad job, telling world fast enough virus look Trump, says virus dancing moron. scared lose that's keep telling lies also teils CDC ehat say say gonna lie. 
Check what's going coutries got infected yours. let think virus yours? living boulbe helps close eyes truth friend unlucky...most people much empirical evidence masks reduce covid19 transmission rates 80%? one one single person organization ever made claim masks reduce transmission 100%. beastie boys fought possibly died right party ... US Flails FREELY*

FTFY Vaccines cure virus ALREADY IT. Im fron usa  go thousand person party pandemic? real fucking idiot hope ok. Sure, knowing he's shit sheriff, I'm confident people Los Angeles move someone else. always , USA 1st PLACE ANYTHING EXCEPT GOOD THINGS . swear US citizens (most ) retarded gives headache  ""zero regard human rights""

Lol ok Mr. 230k. you, would avoid heavy workouts another month sure. cases fit people recovered, went back routine got clobbered hard cases, hospitalized. would take cautiously even though feel 100% Woah buddy that’s sOcIaLiSm talk. got freedoms ya know. MURICA! Murica look China. Massive country first hit pandemic almost sign it, entirety country back feet businesses pretty much fully operational. almost like thing pretty infectious! election promises failed achieve? curious, New Zealander. much. really can't understand fallout? Chop like Saudis do! Hate break you, chances covid killing far higher. data proven repeatedly mask use reduces transmission rates 80%.  ever occurred people countries done nothing address pandemic things would much, much worse? proof measures work proof virus incredibly contagious. Ayy seen girls snap story party. Looked uncomfortably packed Yes, do.

And fact work hospital made comment 10 times worse. Next year : Nigel Farrage starts pro-pandemic party. drink people social drinking. mean? No. necessarily. ppl sure. ppl sad pandemic takes toll us emotionally deprives us human contact makes essential tasks elevated dangers. Nobody happy suspicious like time everything scared others worry loved ones might fall ill. It’s scary. It’s tragic. lost ~250-300k lives hasn’t even year since pandemic started. state global distress travel limited wanted go support system difficult now. Parents don’t really know manageable keep children home work responsibilities don’t know safely get assistance. People living difficult life many jobless can’t find work take high risk positions easy find. People can’t really talk friends gatherings enjoy day. It’s difficult. think might looking standoffish way. I'm sure understand bad natural herd immunity? ya’ll 70? probably worse one since one bunch tricksy accessory proteins mess immune system OC43 coronavirus not. loses self-attanuates years/decades, cold-like. not, think flu seasons bad double flu seasons forseeable future. Nothing like now, still. Army base Hispanic culture. wouldn’t bad base actually followed guidelines allow people go day even positive tests. family went hospital lax rules yet one countries yet get first wave. real though lol Think BBC Hospital - Coronavirus Special. doesnt amaze anymore tag usa talkin shithole country? Slovenia probably developed US moment. Wait not? pretty weak virus go without even knowing Trace together People told repeatedly noncompliance masks mandates social distancing would lead severe restrictions fucking care.  whatever hell want scream bloody murder face consequences actions. chin noses sticking out.

😂😂😂 people this? lot research going right pointing heart brain damage quite common even asymptomatic cases. 

""A German study found 78 percent recovered COVID-19 patients, majority mild moderate symptoms, demonstrated cardiac involvement two months initial diagnoses."" that's reductive view brexit actually was, honestly disappointment many people uk unable look past petty grievances actually understand made many people vote did. failure even try understand coming probably substantial part trust establishment, half country right now. Would behoove us greatly increase much genetic sequencing cases. Without largely guesswork got it. never wear mask WA. Nobody  flu vaccines use interesting tricks make vaccines effective since meant last months know. That's saying. There'll help coming outside state now. resources states they'll have, there'll none spare one place send spots. cavalry's coming save day now. Every state's own.

The US could prepared unified national strategy, gotten ready Fall Winter Spring Summer. that's administration mind. wish one ill, hope steps soon possible. LA whole bueno yeah feel that. really encourage keep acting responsible huge amounts people refuse to, especially feels like effort sacrifice count result. awesome!!! Happy Halloween! 🎃 BBC, etc called state run media again? Meanwhile game night small group friends canceled one friends shares office guy came back fron Florida want risk things incase guy came back infected.

It never ceases amaze me. number people actively right thing always HUGELY outnumbered working it. thing global warming. thing recycling. thing earning money.

The fact anything gets done sheer blind luck. deep condolences. done full lockdown 4-6 weeks spring US would much better now.  economy would recovered restrictions would lifted.  Instead people fought measures tooth nail entire past 6 months US completely fucked.  one advocating full lockdown months end virus gone. 😂😂😂 live little makeshift reddit reality jeez Should’ve followed rules. many sheriffs country run unopposed. US far behind behavior. know reasons really okay heart putting hundreds thousands preventable deaths? consistent values kind person want be? I’d estimate 98% people travelling tube wearing masks UK.

I know there’s narrative UK people generally worn masks May propose burying bodies vertically save space? reason pandemics like humans intelligent stupidly self centered. yeah guess we're waiting science something. wear n95 cloth everywhere. History science tells us joke like treat it. Yes, Wales graph. announcement still applies England. That’s airlines loves them.

It’s every employers best friend. cheap compared measures like removing tables paying sick leave also makes individual problem. start bother later, I'll go edit now, thanks. Yes, I'm aware. Wales N.Ireland lockdowns graph. Baaaamm!!!! That's man! pandemic also doesnt end next week. help people long time, money start dry up. Even faster, many lose jobs country loses taxes people. years reading ""fooled media"" point instant red flag whoever's wrote comment entitled douchebag I’d gladly quarantine three times amount let Feels like things adress discussed discussed elsewhere wont go here. 

Regarding left thing obviously depends mean left. Im refering fact goverment controls lots money (5th biggest world), goverment lots safetynets, gender equality, welcoming lots of  refugees, long parentalleave parents, highest taxes high incomes world, extremely securalized etc

If compared US conservatives think wouldnt agree things. 

It left though, agree that. concerns rise bigger places. talk US, imagine Texas distance cities. 
Now introduce problem locally: one place runs test (several reasons happens occur, people appear there, count off, hell someone stumble ruin bag tests, invalidating them). nearest town resupply keep running. slovakia much problem since towns place, takes literal minutes get there.  
In place like texas however? town middle nowhere runs tests closest city several hours away...yeah gotta prepare situations.

But far human resources go, yes, bigger countries also bigger amount available resources (and becomes way easier hiring job bigger go) last part rly hit bro 😞 happens like happened flu shots, vaccines actually cause deaths stronger symptoms. bad breath don’t want smell breath enclose space know exactly Germany dealing it, Belgium let tell wish same. Replace every instance word ""council"" ""advice"".

The Swedish word council word advice. Whatever software translated text fails see difference. rounding corner right? Prayers good recovery  N95 masks effective **WHEN PROPERLY FIT TESTED**. assume wearing N95 mask get hands effective. come different sizes, types fit. Hospital employees (like me) must get fit tested every year order maintain compliance must know specific mask works best properly wear them.

If people assume N95 enough, confident still risk infection. It'll better mask want see someone thinking protected aren't. cannot get fit tested (it involves another person squirting sweet bitter things face FYI) waste money it. 

AND WASH HANDS. people washed hands **properly**, society would better place. ways it’s beneficial whats called “officer discretion”. example let’s say you’re speeding 26 55mph freeway, everyone else around you. however, standout made lane change without using turn signal cop pulls over. officer wanted could cite failure signal speeding 26 mph limit, state reckless driving. would 9 points total license 12 allowed, misdemeanor, ton fines, massive car insurance premium hike. officer however good mood instead cites going 15 gives warning signal violation. officer discretion, 3 points license, smaller fine, much lower insurance increase, criminal charges. 

It’s speeding fines this. college freshman, got busted alcohol party. friends could charged minor possession (misdemeanor) cop instead made us dump booze sink let us warning.  keeping light make soldiers think one home. 

It’s war saying putting modern context current silent covid war, it’s really right now. ones keep draw attention ones risking lives. It’s point way things going come back bite someone know point.

I know hard. I’m things I’m tired. don’t even work, got unemployment get barely $100 week now. want look back know right thing self, preventing someone else getting sick. 

I already saw two people know die peak NYC enough go seriously, even really need go bar, see loads friends, go eat inside restaurant. don’t need thing temporarily it’s small sacrifice made short time big scheme life still small quarantine bubble stick with, taken hobbies home, learning new trades, FaceTiming whole family probably won’t see year two (they live across globe) grateful happening 50-100 years ago things would way way harder 

It sucks, totally understand people it. reality it’s far patient end point (or control) look people example Halloween parties feel sad selfish also glad conscience them. Everyone making effort count! one them. Keep This^ anyone half brain known long time now. watched ravage Italy Spain reason. Hell remember knowing much trouble back February watching Chinese build two new hospitals two weeks. Seeing strength lockdowns reporting... thought Americans get things done rugged individualism. comes teamwork suck. i'm worried unironically believe this! They'll sink poverty leverage make deals. maybe sell russia china like child daddy issues side pond.

Breaking stuff hurt EU. hurts people. yes. estimations work. personally attest like numbers much. AKA Dunbar's Number

*Dunbar's number suggested cognitive limit number people one maintain stable social relationships—relationships individual knows person person relates every believe there's lot history 1945 Yes did. Tegnell Giesecke obsessing immunity March April. kept wrong. People kept dying.

They're herd immunity anymore. case staff member working Christchurch managed isolation facility group international mariners staying. total 31 positive Covid cases linked group.


Once eradicated, risk remains outside. Worldwide eradication possible, countries agree simultaneously eradicate.

Difficult king troll charge. also want baby sit kids. ""Its hard."" Time nap naps now, shhh I'm sure lot colourful names you. Hi, beginning support lockdowns. Corona somewhat new time lockdowns started. fine first 2-3 months. However, day day day day fucking house 7 months made fucking losing it. Everything felt gray. Nothing made feel anything. Almost emotion less. 

You’re right apologize advocating lockdowns. hope this, never again. think never done therefore everyone looking whether works. really test and/or isolate everyone two weeks numbers go safe levels soon.

I always convinced mass testing would much better safer way go mass vaccinating. know tests work, know safe pretty cheap compared measures (such lockdowns). hand know vaccine arrives many (incl me) worry possible unknown long-term side effects.

So would rather want world focus test costs $10 distributed freely everyone monthly basis. Nobody yet told argument work. Someday lucky enough, send home islamic immigrants Europe back medieval iraqs whatever shithole shitface mohamad fucksons born in. Europe longer see need cuts like Farage.

Come guys. clearly see fucking islam religion hate warmongering. fucking need crusades fucking mohamad small dick population. Higher spread make huge difference required duration though. increases probability go extra generation virus, maybe week two, like going take twice long.

Problem is, UK's leadership Vic did. They'll get cases lower, open again, another circuit breaker months later.

In defence UK, close borders, seeing Europe seem talking eradication either rn. throat stomach assume? want sauce that? makes wonder too. everyone area care. denial, fatigue, defenses down, would rather accept fate. style.

are pandemics real thing?  happened before? warned something exactly like years? exponential growth voodoo? seen respiratory diseases seen people sick it? know people died? know you, definitely say yes this.

and i'll follow carlin quote, ""think stupid average person is, half stupider that."" context, makes sense.

we information available. know do. like them. unfortunately, paying price now. Eh, shit us MA. control whole, happening again. forgot take warning. actually true. Americans expecting autism death reality they'll getting immunity Covid. terrible deal! Guilt tripping someone who's already anxious, wow. Melbourne cold af I've seen Social dilemma Netflix. people spreading hoaxes Slovakia using Facebook Youtube major platform spreading them. Facebook already far far data gathered government got one nasal swab.

Like information could get testing? DNA? There's probably single person Slovakia never got blood taken, government wanted could already easily DNA samples us. 83 entire households pretty much nothing though. pretty ridiculous read what’s face bragging Melbourne locked down. months imaginary, like three. Don’t worry Florida, trump said already ended virus. Slovak testing enforced, mandatory say politicians short sighted. live Germany city borders France. Nobody took seriously. day borders opened again, countries went back ""normal"" people acted like nothing going on. distancing, meeting neighbors friends, shopping, eating out. majority public really failed themselves. Well living simply changing date death. Wait, thought trump said ended Coronavirus.  really teres use google, might learn things.  

I’ve done pandemic drills Homeland Security, going back far 2009.  hospitals get overwhelmed, CFR go 2X, 5X, 10X, 20X, depends number factors.  Italy open hospital beds medicine CFR still almost hit 10%.  

Go lookup spent thousands restaurants months first soft lock down. spend 0 now. want keep businesses open, making enough worsen overall situation Australian tell like live real country real leadership??? closer 1300 reality
 govt declaring 30% deaths according leaked documents. It’s napkin math point man. 100k cases day real trouble. Particularly rural parts country small health systems. Yes icu hospitals fill up. Yes particularly flu season. difference even close flu... knew though right? SAY AGAIN, NOW! hope. count excess deaths spain twice declared count. wrong people? Quarantine... Quarantine never changes. *Music plays: want set world fire... idiots. Got it. BoJo chums even deserve ""at least tried"" award farce I'm sure possible USA.

Possibly March/April, great majority governors supported it. question states closing borders feels unlikely get response there. I'd guess somewhere written somewhere border shall ever closed. half measures Walter Speechless. Yeah expensive stand (EU) mafia. Good argument.

They get rid oligarchs too. EU exit first step. understand laments. chaotic mess - that's completely normal large scale endeavor done first time, especially time pressure. virus gonna wait legal opinions supreme court, inter-agency quibbles subside.

Given physical constraints, logistical organizational side project objectively stellar. tactical goals achieved. Based preliminary results previous limited deployment, strategic goal suppressing epidemic hard-hit regions also achieved. Test positivity declining rapidly. within reasonable budget. People love simple solutions. ""Just wear mask covid go away"". need social distancing, closing schools, restaurants etc. wear magical Covid Shield live life normally simultaneously helping fight Covid-19.

Anti-maskers wear masks incorrectly also concrete enemy something invisible abstract like virus, easier people relate to. unfathomable reason, growth slow spite wearing mask, blame people. mask also highly visible way show world ""I'm part"", makes people feel good. used isolate tested positive together families order flatten curve. People work say ""back pandemic"" Normal occupancy 50 70% depending location. People moderate severe asthma may higher risk getting sick COVID-19.  COVID-19 affect nose, throat, lungs (respiratory tract); cause asthma attack; possibly lead pneumonia acute respiratory disease. 

With amount younger people asthma overall lower mortality rate compared general population, would appear age would important factor comes play someone's asthma.  


With said, also appears people asthma increased risk severe COVID-19, would best take extra precautions catch it. Please take article grain salt remember:
1. post viral syndromes incredibly common across wide variety viruses

2. 90% citing anecdotal evidence. fine point departure research nothing would use diagnose treat

3. millions cases *Some* bound outliers.



All said one hard piece evidence cited: abnormal cardiac MRIs I'd like see source on. researchers make this? Hundreds reasons cardiac inflammation testing thought process? looks pretty much normal now. Masks, lots people about. Felt good get burger sit nice high 20s, seeing everyone else similar.

Hopefully nightmare over. He's right. certain point exponential spread, soft measures like distancing, masking, contact tracing going enough anymore. pissing brushfire point. way bring raging surge like European ones US Midwest one control forcibly close shit 6-8 weeks. right teacher delusional many means.

But got one thing right: TTI solution. Rapid tests around corner.
Enforce weekly testing schools, workplaces, events enforce isolation. Job done.
This costs even 10% month lockdown PER YEAR agile mutations.

The thing missing picture combined capacity test manufacturers.
Can done months years?

Slovakia could buy 5M tests Korea, delivered weeks. long 25M? bit hygiene discipline, even monthly testing round might enough. Good, mean Florida whole what??? 4% total population Florida confirmed Covid test? earth take away freedom!!!! much country big reality either acted together

haha. Good one.

If learned one thing last 6 months matter topic good portion people happily exact opposite everyone else sheer fucking spite. Tough say asymptomatic people went, symptoms contact case previously confirmed per PCR test, supposed go PCR test.

As mortality rate, factor Slovakia counts deaths corona deaths case autopsy confirmed patient died ""lung form Covid"". I’m really annoyed got upvoted too, believes bs got downvoted hell saying wont oxford v -thread, wer everyone planning big new years gatherings. surely highly location dependent. live, people wearing mask, those, would say somewhere 40 60 percent covering nose, research shown makes mask enormously less useful. teacher, I'm unwilling risk life selfish idiots can't understand accepted safety precautions, think ""right"" go maskless outstrips right become desperately ill. Switzerland even worse, still aren´t locked down, kantons. I’m serious,y frightened November 4. crept mind Trump might possibly win even loses, could purposely lot damage leaving office. scorched earth policy beyond man. weird people that. Like that's still shit load people dying focused survirors? Even lower ratio people get people die. Poorer countries, especially Africa, tend younger populations though. don’t many old folks homes act reservoirs high rates diabetes/obesity/hypertension. NYC liberals screaming people stay home social distance? can't nice things. case justification correct, recovered placed ventilator. Well, he's got vote. ""MP""? ""Admits""? Frst asks politician vaccines, would something ""admit"", like something people expected politicians deliver? 

Experts (those asked) said along. 

One huge reason vaccine eradicate disease virus human virus. going vaccinate 100% humans, much less 100% cats ferrets... say, preventing spread preventing catching it.

While masks better protecting wearer, assumes practice good hygiene wash hands regularly.

No point best mask available virus hands touch face, say pulling mask bit scratch side nose. New Zealand - South Korea - someone mentioned Vietnam. countries much better USA gone back normal. pandemic infection rates go down. transitional period vaccine exists rates haven’t gone yet. doubt. [Biden already wants Fauci serving administration, wins. 

But depressing think three months even weaker federal response sans Fauci would look like middle current surge. Bingo... shame took long clear it. Dropped too. 
I even got license make sure signature matched official one. I'm messing around year. realize Florida really late term abortions. future florida man may jeopardy...we could lose whole generation morons. video coverage documentary hospitals think people would atleast take thing serious. thefederalist.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* pay price others stupidity, unfortunately can’t live bubble forever. Cruises bad idea even without pandemic. Greetings future. 

From Europe! 😉 I'm sorry, we're talking human beings here.

Most people emotionally mature adulthood can't trusted make right decisions hard. I'm authoritarian, truth humanity. I'm smart educated person bunch smart educated friends would ready look around wonder everyone can't responsible like privileged friends. 

They can't. without actual rules enforcement. live US week never happen, pretend people behave like mature adults surprised pikachu smear poop wall join Q*non cult. 

We deluded mature smart people are, thin tried harder could magically become smart mature. can't. need accept leave weekend find teenagers huge party burnt house down. fault? really. ours. children. Hopefully allow full-body Covid protection oxygen tank.. 1000 nothing. Miami clubs packed ever before. past weekend saw 2-3x people precovid times bars. even music festivals several venues That's... denier, daredevil. Folks, problem is, agreeing this, signed new social contract. Mitigating specific death matters tenets give life quality. preventing death though complete abrogation rights freedoms necessary now, necessary always. 

Deaths stop mattering sick masks lockdowns, rubric, even covid, excess deaths must take precedence sole directive humanity. would render everything lockdowners support hypocritical, otherwise death matters certain peaks certain ways, that's eugenics.

The longer people buy this, smaller life becomes, propaganda ingrained, people adapt, authoritarian allowed be, worse get, regardless whether there's still viral threat not. 

Once start going path like this, switch one day, continues cascade. choice made, simple setting personal deadline stop complying well late. I’ll get vaccine bro chill /s. similar experience. It’s frustrating see, especially still took kids trick treating. unnecessary activity. least understand people want celebrate thanksgiving Christmas see family Halloween? dress eat candy? Come on. suggest? Childhood obesity abuse IMO (mildly) fair, kids probably spending weekdays classes together; doubt outdoor meet going significantly affect transmission rates.

Now, getting candy hands bunch strangers... thought meant mods would remove don’t see would reason so. thoughts. Nice. Let highly intelligent caring people gather together. Everything going according plan. Hopefully make 30 start saving world! We're better, foresee getting much worse. think Walz issue stay home request/order Tuesday. think lot lockdowns/dial back waiting Tuesday. want risk people voting democrats shut down. means people get vaccine overload ICU's - poor medical staff Eh, clear lockdown last case scenario, it’s nobody (in Europe US least) listened, necessitating panicked lockdowns hospitals started overwhelmed.

The released lot comprehensive plans different scenarios emphasised mass testing, tracking tracing, localised isolating strict quarantining. 

We listen infectious disease doctors. maybe lockdowns wouldn’t necessary. bottleneck testing supplies, problem could easily clear 40k tests day. Here's [testing capacities reported labs themselves. Americans angry Netherlands sorry downvotes One parents traveled NJ FL couple months ago covid really raging got Jersey numbers control. fucking pissed dude. disease ""wiped out"" vaccine know Smallpox.  Polio close.  Measles Mumps Diptheria Tetanus seem hanging there. Relatively children died mass shootings, yet kids' constitutional right keep bear arms infringed upon schools.

/s Sheesh, fine all? America. Everyone's selfish nobody wants shut anyway. whole country needs though, regardless economic effects we're killing citizens. Wow 99.5 survival rate (closer 99.99 40) sCaRy! denying serious is, denying existence. deny person's rights, mean exist. *darwin emoji wait member family dies see can't get it. every person dies nCov real loss someone family. empathy bro can't fire Fauci. within power that. not. BOS AVL round trip, $150! think people realize sarcastic. least hope sarcastic. never get flu vaccine gotten flu. know people get vaccines regularly ones consistently get sick. telling trust seen witnessed eyes trust look profit situation. Seems like true genius me. Restaurants one top vectors infection. Enclosed spaces + poor ventilation + HVAC system = infection. Distance really matter, one patient china infected 3 families restaurant far away themselves. count immune, develop permanent immunity coronavirus, reason believe one. people North East say ""I warned you"" allowed. love people. That’s dislike people. Thus 1st generation... lowest hanging fruit basic contact tracing. utter BS say actually know EVERY place holds event sees dramatic increase within couple weeks.

The true number is, course, much higher, becomes increasingly difficult trace.

For red hats good math, look around next rally.

40 die went rally. paints China's response negative light. Downvotes already begun. Good job learning countries cities. Keep good work. Operate maximum efficiency show Texas amazing! WOO! Dropped ballot person last week! Can’t wait Nov 4th virus that's affecting well being. lockdown confidence animals intermediate hosts receptor compatibility. great mystery. Exactly. fail realize people aware underlying health issue, got covid, late. could much anyone, barring get regular check ups. ever happened 260,000 cases Sturgis guys predicting?  sort dropped media days. Americas big island 

So Britain didn’t say would effective, FDA’s standard pretty frightening low. It’s half courtesy half narrow trails sometimes possible maintain 6 feet passing. know health experts said risk low briefly passing lower risk cost me, wouldn’t I? Among hiking community recommendation well. Sadly seem sarcasm. article yesterday accurate data hospitalizations made public. Yes - that's PCR tests (active infection). can't isolate people antibodies, people \*not\* infectious (because infection several weeks ago unlikely reinfected). need mandatory isolations don’t rely individuals isolate themselves. [China Vietnam used tiered strategies dealing virus praised. people say comorbidity COVID deniers since they're denying fact COVID exists. people think take risks virus, deniers virus. Learn words mean, geez. need global lockdown 6 weeks massive test trace people get infected detected isolated 

Test everyone fly enter nursing home medical facility running tests subways literally doesnt care. smart ones do. money. believe greater chance getting COVID19 take vaccine don't

... wow... Recently unfriended longtime friend went Hawaii week. Dude. No. good question. based general advice place since last spring. tips go beyond little detailed. thinking similar, says Maria Rotzén great go back lived last spring, without feelings anxiety. would really great.

What's point, now? temporary dip like pandemic big win companies go bankrupt. cost balanced much money ""account"", balanced alternative costs.

If people taken care unemployed (the norm developed/rich countries) paying \*keep\* jobs, much expensive governments paying lost jobs. Proven strong word Hospitalizations seem reliable metric imposing restrictions people refusing tested. Covid deniers think they’re picture perfect health somehow. comment.  mentioned ""all testing percentage positive"" took mean total cumulative number tests positive results since March.  testing statistic referring to?  

It seems testing happened months ago meaningless evaluating currently going on.  see headlines various press releases statements emphasize total number cases seems misleading counts current number active cases, people hospital, ICU.  Recent testing results. also read that. chose clean also told us wear masks couple months.

I lot faith system right now.  figured safer better (but correct). even restrictions live (East TN). ridiculous. Several vaccines tested lab animals created sterilizing immunity. Especially intranasal vaccines particularly effective preventing establishment infection. bad supporters give shit. point whatever wants hero Minnesota capacity. say MN Mayo clinic instrumental helping get capacity up. Y'all seem better shape are. I'm kinda jealous friends across river. :) Unconfirmed.

If played feet ball really American football today it? great one particular school taking things seriously. Sounds like there's smart, informed people working there. Maybe even smart parents give kid tylenol cover fever could go work. 

I'm sure imagine places careful, thoughtful, educated though. Many people get information bad sources purposefully break rules, within arms reach towns eventually get ya. people don’t die bullets die bullets blows mind, American US, realizing noise distracts looking countries done OK this: mandatory lockdowns, yes, also test. Entire cities, necessary. possible tackle even without vaccine, strategies simply pursued garbage president succeeded making recalcitrant political ""debate"" hinder efforts get years come. disheartening. Thanks. keep have. Hopefully help.

Stay safe, good luck. two positive rates.

About 14% tests last week positive.

About 27% people tested last week positive.

This people (mainly healthcare workers) tested week.

I'm going guess tested everyone, would closer first rate. Still high. quarantine prison camp them! /s born still family South Africa, spent 10 years Brazil. know talking right. thorny issues 1st world must realize dealing 3rd world countries.

However, encourage something without forcing to. 1st world countries fund education opportunities, provide BC women help overall living standards 3rd world countries. time move fuck corona virus. Stop trying destroy everyone's lives paranoid, social media obsessed, pieces shit. can't save everyone everything. People fucking die get it. BLM riots course contribute anything. ""Stay home, except protesting""  happens is, customer's oxygen consumption predictable always being, keeping supplied easy. problem customers suddenly spike typical usage rates. Even supplier keep tends happen is, say truck breaks down, past another truck get route couple hours. peak O2 demand, took much longer time get replacement truck. Every customer reserve level hospital that's seen sudden spike O2 consumption, reserve levels surge usage dip uncomfortably low it. work industrial gas company, run customer gas shit got closer anyone comfortable with. aware that, European btw applies here. read us news second covid wave killing less people thought wait 2-4 weeks... seen argument way often proven wrong usual delays!  You’re meth. fucks sub.

Why fuck aren’t moderators banning shits? They’re actively undermining safety presenting bad faith arguments comments go following medical advice protective measures need adopt. go school? Thank you! :) Yes. implying that. 

Soldiers sick sent back home, trains whatever mode transportation. 

This helped deadlier version virus spread. hope friend lives heard; keeps dismissing based idea low death rate smh page attempting access available country.

-sincerely, born Floridian Lol knew coming frown boarding military gas mask on? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article right start?

&amp;#x200B;

/s Pandemic fatigue highest level see lot people picture tightly packed crowd without masks on. yeah, I’m surprised. It’s like virus attacks stupid. Unfortunately, doesn’t confine them. Oh, must forgotten happened New York. lie. Pluripotent stem cells generated skin cells. fetal cells. common knowledge like 5 6 years need use fetuses stem cells anymore. Stop it. Cant get new cases everybody infected.

Problem solved. wouldnt speak confidently two data points, considering rapid pace France catching US categories supporters care. approval rating actually up, they're going suddenly wake Wednesday see error ways, know. still spreading shard can. made realise much (some of) media blame this.

Any rational, pros cons considered conversation would cherry picked death soundbites outrageous phrases. sad, strange person really hiding point, basic survival instincts kicking in. disagree, that's ok! probability likely one many, many things get UK incompetent leader Boris. Combination partial vaccines, hygiene practices, treatment. turn flu that’s good enough. Viral load matters. longer contact someone breathe in. cases record anyone catching momentary contact walking past someone outdoors. Darwin patient. Party like it’s 1999. official 4% become 40% Yes herd immunity important... everyone vaccinated so, protects can't. 

""Herd immunity"" last couple months taken bad definition, let virus kill whoever wants. also achieved vaccine. Well N95's do.... can't ;) keep schools open? Correct, Hawaii UK. First trimester fatigue joke. taking 2 hour nap every single day first trimester. going bed 830 latest. dizziness also symptom many pregnancy. well could nothing covid. Right, impossible know long-term prognosis treatments available years road, alarmist suggest COVID-19 shave decade recovered patient's life expectancy. Man, coworker like this. Shows video random crazy guy hospital yelling incoherently conspiracies claims solid proof they're overcounting. video hosted sketchy video sharing site random guy provide name credentials talking tuberculosis deaths higher, look nurses laughing smiling could many people dying.

They latch onto random person they've never met provides reason trust them... they're saying want hear. Meanwhile legitimate experts say something dont want hear frauds. Right. like even know confirmation bias anyway. ""A German study found 78 percent recovered COVID-19 patients, majority mild moderate symptoms, demonstrated cardiac involvement two months initial diagnoses.""

This study even control cannot draw conclusions big hire whole Amazon shipping weeks I'd say, weeks enough guess?? basically US. Even fun: State Georgia includes partial results graphs amended upwards days later. gives viewer impression trend always going last days. Paid uk case.... guidelines country isolate get tested contact 48 hours symptoms appeared. What's wrong people wearing masks?  limited infections proper contact tracing. amazing watching someone full throatedly declare racist, ignorant piece shit demonstrating lack understanding basic level people, people, arr allowed live modern society.

It's shame American. can’t fix stupid wrote supplemental O2 reason. outlier, people due gasp breathe flu, especially elderly, die. supplemental O2 usually works. aunt COVID, O2 seemed hardly help died, exhausted, gasping. Horrible daughters see, let full PPE. There's tricky financial tie involved here. seems likely honesty. Whoosh   largest group indoor activity ethically acceptable? would like hang friends, time contribute I'm actually concerned Pandemic fatigue healthcare staff. nurse battling disease point pure exhaustion last 7 months, saw absolute shit storm flying way, honestly might bail. Haha getting downvoted?

Even tests “free” us, doesn’t make cheap tests less important. they’re cheaper, governments buy make readily available. course price still importance. vaccine drops number killed acceptable amount thing matters. Hope mutations make lot less deadly, less symptoms contiguous, manageable? hand accelerate treatment regimens plans could reduce hospitalizations don’t overwhelm healthcare industries would like see data this, think someone asymptomatic always spread less someone coughing. Case point asymptomatic friend spent several hours indoor dinner several people including night getting fever infect anyone. Nah Asian island countries are. Europe currently seeing even bigger outbreak America moment. Um maybe someone channel 3000 can’t read, DHS dashboard says positivity rate 15% 30%. Also, thing lot dumb car crash analogies forget car crashes contagious spread exponentially populations early say. Bankruptcy protection laws article states, Australia entered recession job losses massive.

We shall see reporting brings next quarter. Christmas four weeks Thanksgiving. many people mourning loss loved ones rather celebrating Christmas. Halloween impact Thanksgiving. Also parents can't take care kids work time. like people dumb hell. look Europe...its closed ""models"" ""hardmen"" dont like wear masks think country ever get perfect compliance, can:

- Improve communication: absolute disaster Boris especially work home indoor dining.
- Better testing tracing: full excel spreadsheet, rest case

I think fault leadership people simply complying way see it. are, still acting like kids changed life. Hi

Two days ago sneezes runny/bunged nose rotten headache 24 hours. Still got swollen sinus feeling tired occasional sneezes. fever (highest temp 37.4), cough. loss smell. Breathing ok afaik. Resting heart rate 60 below. signifier somewhat reduced Heart Rate Variability.

Is worth getting test?

Ta. I’m serious, around 4/100 Floridians tested positive. low rate, wear masks Thank I’m MO too. state live? getting pretty nervous surge. shouldn’t feel bad cause Ybor Tampa looked same! /s (I’m mad state can’t get shit together) Oh yeah old persokt bodies ain't nothing. I've seen cleaned fifty. looking dead kid even ever help extremely biased tries pretend ""totally lockdown""

You angry think Sweden lockdown call lockdown?

I don’t wanna criticize Vietnam yeah, responded early little late USA England. would viable local lockdowns working, working track trace system, rugged infrastructure, individuals following softer measures prevent spread. Putting cell calling justice atm im hospital system outpatient radiology practice 20 offices. recently got tested covid urgent health style place, guy test actually X-ray tech. asked job apparently start pay im making 3 years here, better insurance, bonuses, lighter work load.

It final stray. Im sticking around till Jan hopeful winter bonus im out. Correct thing border towns lot people live one side border work other. Checked post history. kind issue I’m probably something right. would un ask. She’s different thought.  New Zealand small island seal borders. could US state European country legally this? Without going continuous introduction new cases could hold evry person accountable get buy healthy stuff somebody new come use easy options again, it’s bandaid fix “hold people accountable” people hold accountable would city planners representatives something zones don’t exist first place. not? Definitely agree that. would add usually make vaccines tight schedule. scenarios, thing would happen might even consider vaccine ready release combat mild things...however, bit urgent getting good perfect acceptable Belittling people fatigue needs stop. going shit. One social media post appears show car ending top another vehicle.

wat politically biased post day goes sir. mass gatherings potential spread virus. lot BLM protestors meeting make signs, drink, etc.  easy. Yeah, late. It’s world wide. one shot, missed it. Best hope combination vaccine herd immunity.

Do option? lets say making good-faith comparison here. 

even supermarkets, least state, allowed without mask, limits capacity, they've done away samples, in-person deli service, etc. Grocery stores necessary pandemic, people need groceries live. 

Compare halloween party.  People packed in, distant, adequate masks, sharing drinks, drugs, spit, air. Young people less likely symptoms, able spread deadly virus susceptible people. Parties unnecessary pandemic, people need party live. Colorado state normal BMI? 1 year lockdowns set us back lot years.

No, wouldn't. 

Virtually *everything* done remotely now. kind high intensity scientific work already done clean rooms strict measures is. Business conducted entirely computers now. There's *need* blowhard luncheon Four Seasons. appearances only. Education easily done remotely; whether people like secondary. manufacturing moving toward automation decades would increase push. Absolute essential employees would work still, even there's ways structure regiment things. 

I'm advocating year long global lockdown, would preposterous, suggest would set us back ""hundreds"" years laughable. would speed bump, best. South Korea Vietnam never locked down. Nordic countries never recommended widespread mask use still fine. New Zealand sealed borders enough infections contact tracing still worked. borders still sealed btw. Outcomes dependent lot lockdowns mask mandates Hey way go. Schools important health. I'm sure teacher rationalized away said....ah odds catching blah blah blah.

Oh world US experiencing 90k cases per day? Gee wonder.

Hey schools opened up......you're awesome! 

Super important thousands lives people's health. Thumbs up. I’ve dirt fucking poor before. Thankfully longer am. still wasn’t shoving garbage throat. ways acquire grains meats even “food deserts.” I’ve lived it. 

If never hold people accountable won’t change. Wow you’re desperate huh? Yeah read wrote, everyone read knows really meant. You’re transparent it’s hilarious, get grip Pretty much. last part vital! live, bars restaurants closed, offices open full. find baffling that's still happening. made valid point situation.

Haha, like person. plumber house week day repipe something otherwise I'd forego hot water forever. awful! walls floors counters everything never bleach-clean now! know *should* compelled state.

But state probably thing would large, populous, diverse country. can't expect 330M divided people across huge land mass pull together figure out, especially disinformation actual stupidity. Book deal speaking engagements worth more. That's fear-based authoritarian thinkers say like authority du jour. final episode season 1 absolutely peak show. one best finales show I've seen, IIRC.

I stoked see Dr Jenner told Rick. 4 weeks 2 cycles infection typically cuts number infections 30-70% don’t fo full lockdown. took like 12 weeks measures Spring 2020 effort. 

Sadly country gave win war. countries still restrictions, mention vastly different geography. time anyone even suggesting lockdowns United States already widespread community spread point would eradicated like New Zealand. achieved goals initial lockdown, plenty countries lockdown: Sweden, Japan, Belarus example. Rolling lockdowns going make anything better That's awful. I'm sorry. Good you! I’m going Disneyworld tomorrow week! Life goes on. I'm sorry, understand trying say. thought ""die"" previous post typo. I'm starting think bad English. course. true damage MUCH higher. fool's claim can't squarely blame rallies willfully ignoring EVERY one areas sees dramatic increase couple weeks later.

It's statistically significant, literal 100% correlation.

It's ""not proven"" sense can't ""prove"" gravity exists.... sure hell measure effects. There's 100's different jobs health care sector. Yes count blessings pray family don’t get virus. There’s much “small chance.” should. much one question take long time answer. I’ll take three lead vaccines soon they’re approved reasonably effective I’m eligible, I’ll keep wearing mask distancing wherever possible, too.

I’m exposed thousand people per week close contact, I’ll ditch mask start going parties restaurants probably year so. wait starts second term. even begun feel effects destruction shitstain cause.

## Abstract

The relationship SARS-CoV-2 viral load risk disease progression remains largely undefined coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load participants diverse range COVID-19 disease severity, including requiring hospitalization, outpatients mild disease, individuals resolved infection. detected SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNA 27% hospitalized participants, 13% outpatients diagnosed COVID-19. Amongst participants hospitalized COVID-19, report higher prevalence detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load associated worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, increased markers inflammation, including C-reactive protein IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, associated increased risk mortality. data show SARS-CoV-2 viral loads may aid risk stratification patients COVID-19, therefore role disease pathogenesis explored. upstairs neighbor hosts party time every occasion(I suspect makes money it). weekly party going summer, past Halloween swear least 30 people over. funny thing is, see guests walk building masks. What’s point wearing mask walking outside taking 30 people next you? toddler got bored decided see much havoc possible.

To fair, lot people got bored. feel like significant chunk UK give shit Covid-19 more. bizarre. everyone pulled together, we'd much better place. 

This Trump - stupid inconsiderate people everywhere. Sturgis 

South Dakota currently highest number hospitalized COVID patients per capita United States, followed neighboring states. what? Treat people like kids, carrots sticks... (praise consequences) think way much free time hand. I’m sure ain’t gonna getting hit bus self isolating. majority people don’t miraculously lose lives reason getting COVID, pretty certain sped death either case Well, concerning:

The President [told crowd plans fire Dr. Fauci election. work Corona hospital! buddies medical school went Peds. It’s daily battle coax parents helping kids eat better active, plenty telling name calling slightest bit criticism.

I think you’re right point. wouldn't. ""Fake news!""

We're even chapter one ratfucking country. Niaid funded congress funding least extent decided president (although idea exact relations, try make sort wild claim know)

Anything withhold funds for, control. Maybe he's unable anything direct, suggest can't mess properly naive. course can. Rich people play rules like do, reins lot rich people.  far, evolution progress You’re irrational wishing sickness thousands people why? stayed home didn’t?  Yeah I'm blown away too. can't believe many people stand front restaurant waiting mask go inside take off, quite patrons inside maskless. anyone sees cannot put 2 2 together 90k pee day, must completely blind.

Good strong enough put health first. What's point job develop disability keeps working properly later? find way wait safe, happy did. LOL. Sure, Jan. We're talking causes covid even many people it.

Yes are. one talking something else. Talk what's important: people catching COVID fewer people behaving intelligently around it. This,, genuine, right? way. one first people job wear mask back February/March.

I got stared bit train London late Feb started wearing mask.

I get want people buying N95 masks, fuck's sake, telling people cover face anything would helped significantly. hes going win. ACB one bushs lawyers 2000, lost land slide Gore, hes going swindle way watch. need fines fund effort contain fight virus. Honestly I’d feel comfortable going nail salon limit people inside, take temps, require hand washing after, course required masks plexiglass dividers go hang friends keep “safe” “small” mask less get togethers. *MANY* thing. Yeah, Mexico would wise allow Americans. don’t send best brightest. nothing Utah parties! Experts actually believe that’s happened, though. It’s referenced here: soldiers trenches became sick, military evacuated front lines replaced healthy men. process continuously brought virus contact new hosts—young, healthy soldiers could adapt, reproduce, become extremely virulent without danger burning 1918 pandemic it’s difficult since can’t analyze real time, there’s every reason believe pattern behaviour going (the sickest hosts taken back society) fuelled progression virus became virulent. case, Federal law enforcement agents would busting every single marijuana dispensary country every single one illegal according Federal law. stands, DEA chosen enforce law allow states allow dispensaries continue. Tomorrow, decided, could shut every single one down. Law enforcement arm Executive branch discretion apply law. Okay, care. ""Herd immunity"" strategy, whether stated not, hospitals health systems become overwhelmed pushed even point collapse, we'll change narrative, stop testing certainly stop reporting data.

The thing must remember this: IGNORANCE STRENGTH. confirm, barely functioning. Watching videos people considered friends partying maskless past weekend absolutely broken me. Ah, never heard antigen tests context. thought PCR tests anti\*body\* tests available tests, PCR tests detected viral RNA, human antigens. still accepted ""main"" effect vaccines,

Quite true. whole schedule vaccination (possibly all?) existing vaccines based maintaining effective levels circulating antibodies, totally stop infection. interpret it, Faucci telling us might happen quite perfectly time. People ignorant constitutional law, calculus many esoteric subjects.

This here. THANK YOU.

After doom scroll while, click tag gain sanity back. idiot. balid point you’re caught fear mongering you’re blind reason virus contagious earlier phases becomes far less infectious weeks 3+ deaths typically occur. Hence trend towards form natural selection. double Michigan's daily positives.

Based death trends states, they're probably wrong thinking coming came Michigan. mean even hospital admits screwed case, patient responded well treatment. I'm sure defending. done No, I'm pretty sure ok disagree....

I'm wearing masks based evidence I've seen, completely agree making masks mandatory - particularly cloth masks. new information comes light masks shown without doubt, 100 percent effective, yes change stance agree you. reasonable assumption it'll improve ability transmit via surfaces time. never learns We’re 40 Many states count ballots people deceased vote cast, election Co-morbidly obesities? Growing 70s, share healthy junk food. days Halloween think spent 24/7 sugar rushes. much physically active, running around like maniacs recess, gym, school. high school never pop machine it, family ate restaurant every month so. Portion sizes much smaller, get after-school snack, ONE serving dessert dinner.

It's different fast-food joints declared ""essential"" businesses states declared lockdown. I’m giving thing March. I’m wearing mask anymore. F that. I’m already would hate work restaurant right now. 90% clientele must assholish way year.  expectation enough vaccines go around late 2021, healthcare workers able get it. *I* would never work showing symptoms, would immediately get tested. point many people desperately working get by/keep roof heads can’t afford allowed take time off. 😕 probably could started collecting pension 20 years ago. He's 79! HTF two parties thousand people?

Easily, especially big city big space. plain house Texas easily draw hundred people whim. I’m sarcastic well, sometimes dry humor doesn’t come thru well reddit He's Brett P. Giroir, M.D., sworn 16th Assistant Secretary Health U.S. Department Health Human Services Fuck know MODs banned self proclaimed science denying jerks. 

Just come downvote, spew misinformation happy eat shit. welded inside. Well, fair I’m speaking several people subreddit that’s advocating for. Fine line between, forced lockdowns work
so well Spain done worse US? Sweden one lower death rates [worldometer source sort death per 1 million. 
 
When looking statistics, it’s really hard taking anything European nations handful Asian nations accurate numbers. can’t trust Iran’s,China’s third world countries numbers. don’t manpower, resources willpower give accurate statistics. 

I’m saying open everything masks continue hope vaccine. I’m favor anymore shutdowns don’t
Actually fully stop economic ramifications equally terrible. Honestly, right. Anyone who's religious want go hell able recognize everything antichrist would stand refuse him.

However, good chunk, vast majority, Trump's supporters people would consider devout Christians. That's funny part - let's imagine whole christian shebang real. people would right, right *enough,* they'd end hell *because* unconditional beliefs.

At least rest us would schadenfreude enjoy hell happened. “B-but daughter needs realize boils calories vs calories out!! hard! stupid lazy piece shit!”

-Some people thread amount exposure equals severity sickness? ELI5 he's matterial girl! both. go Walmart &amp; look around individuals care. Fail Yeah, surround ""Yes men."" How's working far? Trump hardly guaranteed win start year. polls showing Biden 10 point national lead back February, well COVID front center voters' minds. 

What would guaranteed win? handed crisis dealing competently. Bush able ride 9/11 victory 3 years later. US mounted response good South Korea, even Japan, would definitely cruising victory now.

But didn't, can't. capable dealing something complicated. see everything else does, like healthcare - easy solution (let Paul Ryan deal it) work, basically gives lies he's great job. imagine we'll initially enough supply exactly - healthcare workers, politicians, rich.

...hopefully they'll include elderly group well. 

I illusions I'll able get time first half 2021. Really? Good, I'm worried anymore. people get data? value would Texas data provide collated set data states? Why, wearing mask harm? understand people realize everyone wearing masks COULD go back business usual (almost). Look South Korea! government trying use virus gain absolute power sake eliminating virus, stopping climate change, BLM, ""name reason x,y,z"", power giving back. making least healthy food cheapest accessible, really pretty much shoving throats. There's reason obesity rates higher poorer areas. Yeah that’s I’m saying... Reddit it’s non stop Trump Chopping. Posted people Reddit. 

It’s different Twitter. Biden squeaky clean he’s ruining Donny Pump that’s happening obviously. wonder far left place gone absolutely nobody support want without dogpiled.

I mean, see videos Biden sniffing little girls hair makes physically ill I’ve never seen post here. That’s gotta make wonder. course it’s well documented Donny likes GTBTP FUBAR. 

Does Biden POTUS pitchforks come out... that’s you’re suggesting dude! 

I thought Reddit unbiased bi-partisan source camaraderie that’s deffo case. jeopardise anything. free choice take risk remain locked basement half tonne stockpile flour. 

And importantly, business long intentionally cause harm. dont nah, gonna keep strictly neutral stance.  tired 2020.and 2021 seem gonna much better😢 Indoors visiting friends family. complicated. many people still working sick. showing symptoms get fuck kitchen please... Oh ,how doctor nurse give treatment.  I'm happy vote Johnson 16. I'm also happy state went blue though. Unfortunately many selfish “individualists” still don’t believe harsh reality COVID. really need tour overwhelmed ICU. honestly doesn’t matter whether comes issue race, obviously issue politics suited forum.

Additionally, generalizations groups based race otherwise typically welcome. can’t really think good reason anyone called “fucktard” here. Ohgod accuracy, right next ""getting old shit"" spectrum. Wishing least milliseconds pure unadulterated forgetting (not likely), along tasty celebration treats (here's hoping), get food all. I'll make deal. Canada permanently, invade US take over. government fucking everything need leave. society consumers aren’t eager pay basic lifestyles either.

Unless it’s tipping. Americans hell freeze paying decent wage increasing price menu items compensate. agree ""suggests"" right word. watch video, body language agrees crowd chant it, confirms comment. 

He talked firing Fauci Twitter. Wrong sub post lol. You’ll get attacked downvotes insults merely suggesting ten year lock isn’t best idea. Unfortunately people can't afford self isolate. people working paycheck paycheck, option lose 2 weeks pay. Shittier jobs may fire long. believe many people would self isolate means they'll street month. depressing obvious stated over. shame people consider comorbidities actually read science called COVID deniers simply making point reducing preventable comorbidities good way prevent dying virus, along million diseases associated obesity. China showing incredible results aggressive prevention articles shared week? South Korea also killing it. matter taking seriously anything else. Good thing kids all! things awful! believe reason said wear masks fully understand fast transmits, also shortage ppe, wanted reserve frontline workers states getting hit hardest. thing screwed us adapting. lacked national leadership trump gave state handle way. truth is. situation required national plan consistent message. state level, locking others not. people understand can't go hang friends next stage could. 

Also, cdc pandemic playbook decades research experiences. playbook went every detail. trump completely ignored want people panick. (sorry sounds political). playbook outlined testing contact tracing isolation best tools control pandemic early on. time virus gotten doorstep prepared at. people banking hit us all. set testing time generally lacked tools. Germany however test ready go. trump insisted making american tests. tests defective set us back quite bit. 

By time testing capability test anyone wanted test late. He's thing knows how, playing crowd exact moment without single thought wider implications  It’s matter education education doesn’t always impart empathy responsibility trust large social institutions. know three doctors obeying masking distancing guidelines outside work, workplace full scientists engineers share people reckless work outside it. may correlation people inherent trust large institutions people trust obey call collective action, it’s far black white. family sign waiver refuse medical treatment get save hospital beds? Gamble lives others? quote Red _Shawshank Redemption_

""I hope."" Canada, suspect delegating health responsibilities provinces partly problem.

At times like makes sense federal government take charge, way regulate air traffic even though transportation otherwise provincial matter. Federal government would dictate minimum standards response, i.e. provinces allowed go beyond anything federal dictates. COVID alert app relied provincial support ridiculous kind crisis. Mask mandates also seem municipal bylaws rather provincial federal.

Delegated authority benefits though: Atlantic provinces authority seal rest country, rates respectably low.  fact downvote comment makes clear kind trash are. Pademic try hard nowhere near people like you.

What load lowlife scum are. Red. find sad people incapable discussing things outside whatever internal narrative created themselves. People weak today incapable facing anything pat back reaffirm wishful thinking. Agree completely, actually afraid people call shutdowns least universal masking flu season now. objection wider mask usage, like planes public transportation. don’t want wear mask every time leave house six months every year rest life. Wrong enforce anyone long wait though? really hope affect European decisions. absolute idiot.

Fauci Trump? Yeah also needed healthcare working government. 

So Congress holds Fauci hostage debates next 10 years, Canada borrow him? 

He anything. first 2 years debating weather science exists anyways. ""U.S. reports 97,000 new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase record"" talking 🤦🏻‍♂️ they, Restricting access palatable foods affects children's behavioral response, food selection, intake 
(...) Conclusions: Restricting access focuses children's attention restricted foods, increasing desire obtain consume foods. Restricting children's access palatable foods effective means promoting moderate intake palatable foods may encourage intake foods limited diet.

Other studies come conclusion. This.

Any coordinated, science based response virus would made shoe in. state that?
Illinois currently 14th/50 terms new daily cases per capita. Thats number really counts. give result twenty seconds. It’s going certification tested Heathrow. hate seeing pictures people bars, holding large weddings, parties, feel whose livelihoods depend industry

The fastest way get back normal (and save industries) beat virus first. Extensive contact tracing, masks quarantining would beat month. financially cover businesses keep afloat 4-6 weeks. Done, problem solved. Asian countries beat this.

The Feds would work hand-in-hand state governments enforce. that's problem, GOP (both state feds) come trying stop virus. going use line logic spat out, explain drastic increase excess deaths expected? Yeah, fire ***one*** person who's lending *any* bit sanity towards US response COVID. Fscking petulant child Whitehouse, swear. blame Trump!

What fuck? stupid remember breathe? one knew Franklin county, headline useless noticed COVID patients keep dying though, making room local hospitals. maybe use combination hospital availability COVID deaths. find 95% videos pointless (no new information). watch anyway! Oh say Mark? meant Mike. would love self-isolate I'm still forced go work even though remotely. I'm sure people like me. I’m tired this. want normal life back bad. I’m point don’t even blame people partying seeing friends that. It’s fucking months, humans weren’t meant go long without socialization. Everyone says “just stay inside sooner” that’s even true. really easy “stay inside month we’ll back normal” would pissed people, know it’s never going back vaccine, pretend lockdown bullshit.

It sucks. virus taken essential part humanity us. Fuck China, never forgive them. See, actual stance issue, arguments sides, nowhere near educated enough take side decision. Besides I'm even college yet would rather focus school start forming strong political opinions.

I pointing flaw pro-life logic, there's probably one pro-choice logic well. somebody struggled fat 18, simple. go way learn eat healthy healthy relationship food. still struggle times. You’d surprised many people coast metabolism cant bothered concept counting calories eating vegetables. surprised did. point, anyone brain written Trump effective leader. said, believe Biden would re-hire him, Fauci also made enemies people like Pelosi, Schumer, lobbyists want see Americans ""go back work."" Fauci sugarcoated truth, especially early on, due necessity employed White House.  pandemic gets worse US (and will), become liability whomever charge. greatest tragedy history people dying, getting sick, society heading destruction

BTW, unhappy mental health issue. Suffering mental health issue. Welcome rest planet deals with, folks. fiance invited friend's halloween party. party mansion multiple kegs.

We decided last minute stay home. Full costumes everything.

Saw pics last night - everyone inside, crowded, maskless. people spreading virus.

&amp;#x200B;

We proud stayed home. way.  heard before. Im glad got posted. agree. blew could rivaled biggest landslide history. lot completely self-inflicted acted sooner. think pride though prevented him. think felt entitled win last crazy years played Dems like fiddle. Teflon February. think incapable accepting certain victory jeopardy keep working. think kind hopeful optimism people show ignore bad things hope go away...he something like that. instead going away like intimated several times, got worse. chose wrong course, doubled change course would admit screwed beginning pathological inability admit fault. set course bare minimum regard say over. 

I think this, wins, think pressure dissipates bit. Maybe misrepresents mutation something give new narrative things changed needs step measures. think find way spin narrative way deal this. Otherwise, going continue dog whatever agenda would be...which idea actually even point. whatever wants try accomplish, pandemic keep it. No, give shit freedom - care you. want disproportionately jeopardise peoples freedom personal gain.

It's pretty much antithesis values trying uphold. I've never broken bone need one know something would enjoy thimble full knowledge child protective laws/services, report ultimately nothing considered threat child; joke. South Korea tell thing. think taught doctors scientists? Trump fired several government employees though Back early March referred worst coughing spell I've ever had. literally coughed hard humanly possible day sleep night without medication. went away week chest muscles still hurt months afterwards. found months later doctor Coronavirus back early March visit around time. I'm saying Corona never know. live far Elmhurst Hospital I’m taking virus seriously. often feels imaginary. Iknowright

The protesters lovely ['church West cope coivd, much freedom responsibility all... doomed.. What, like last time... next time? Yeah. sucks probably ""avoidable"" certain people charge avoidable now. Sorry loss comment makes worried. east Asia - southeast Asia - Oceania travel bubble forming. isolated countries ones regions failed contain virus (Philippines, Indonesia, etc.)

I think Malaysia likely next country join bubble.

What research talking about? Asking people research theory, based Plague Inc? Wear mask dipshit UK island (well several islands like NZ Oz) problem theory.

Effective leadership significanly important factor landmass arranged. saying wrong. saying US way better countries even high new daily cases.

I saying US countries even better. look Europe Latin America way worse there. feels like warned New lockdowns recently, ideas why?

I think might something effects poorer countries. signs catastrophy happening far worse experiencing richer countries.
This mean lockdowns bad lockdowns scale. also doesnt mean negative secondary effects lockdowns/closed boarders etc. 

Here example mean. ""Recent estimates also suggest 6,000 children could die every day preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services.""  report UN paints similarly horrible picture.

“This pandemic already caused biggest global education emergency history, increase poverty make hard vulnerable children families make loss”, said Inger Ashing, CEO Save Children.  

“Children lose education likely forced child labour early marriage trapped cycle poverty years come. cannot afford let whole generation children become victims pandemic. National governments international community must step soften study vaccine, too. received injection October 6 (50% chance placebo) followup appointment tomorrow (election day). even fathom eating inside people wearing masks

Really depends individual context. 

* talking college-age kids cramming shoulder shoulder dive-bars acting irresponsibly (in overtly identifiable way)... yeah,. can't fathom either. 

* talking distanced/spaced-out-tables restaurant adults small groups eating (without masks) acting responsibly (putting mask back leaving table using bathroom, etc) ... see problem there. 

I severe case (was Hospitalized 38 days ICU Ventilator 16 days)... go things like Lunch Whole Foods pickup dinner .. .nearly every day. take precautions, keep distance, avoid big groups always wear mask. 

Myself team work already it.. know us saw one us eating restaurant.. would randomly jump conclusion ""we're dumb know we're doing"" ... ? disease isn’t deadly enough mean eradication essential return normal operations. vaccine cut hospitalization rate significantly (also cutting long term damage rates) prevent sizable fraction deaths, enough. cut transmission rates, that’s even better. “The primary thing want people get infected, prevent getting sick, prevent getting sick, ultimately prevent getting seriously ill,” 

Stop fear momgering I'm sure be, continue use ridiculous PHE death numbers include deaths reason following COVID positive test within last 28 days. D614G?

*Reads article* 

Yup. passing mutation happened North Italy back like March/April new. later Singapore like June/July. Canada like month ago, even though found D614G before. reported new? 

 Okay. That's mRNA vaccines work. That’s 100% correct. Everyone pull weights. people responsible would’ve May.  oh stop.

Be careful super volcano may erupt destory US also asteroid may hit asia time also giant tsunami wipes africa europe time!!! oh noooooooo!

&amp;#x200B;

we could easily see 90% deaths happens! one see funny / sexy / scary Halloween costume! want attention damnit! Well that's good thing, since 35,000 students town. Though even represent 10% population, that's still 3,500 students partying. obtained nice weather actually. Today first warm day while.

Wasn't USA still getting 50k days summer? things like think allowed give dozen beatings meaning get vaccine later infected Covid, could still bad long-term Covid effects? meaning Covid transmitted people vaccinated? ""mass graves"" joke I'm going I've hearing.  positive rate area high right now. way positives spring. many people getting tested slowing test results things. seems like going get way worse. hear saying, sure hope get sick anything right now.

It’s testament notion Reddit demographics living antisocial bubbles regards lockdowns Yes, is. late that. clever. they’re island, that’s fact.  done full lockdown 4-6 weeks spring US would much better now. 

You say nations (particularly European ones) harsh lockdowns, yet rival US terms deaths infections per capita. care factor = 0 think know visitors abroad undergo (repeated) tests two-week isolation, imported cases well control. S. Koreans depend entirely contact tracers. Universal mask wearing reduces untraceable cases, virtually every entrance requires QR registration name/phone number guestbook contact tracing. 


Now social distancing level 'Level 1' clubs open everywhere. And... spas saunas. earth public sauna open dares go sauna middle pandemic?

People report reinfections already. guarantee first mild sickness mean easy ride second time around. bottom line stop relying Facebook medical advice. care factor = 0 would assume they're US? Tests free here. every bad story US. Good Lord. Ok bud Yeah, bad opinion New Zealanders Australians. ...and masks! continue used vaccine... no, *required*, Americans inconsiderate listen. agree, difficult convince people get vaccine without long-term testing, mention anti-vaxxers. hesitant myself. minimizes chance severe symptoms, I'll take it. would rather catch covid experience mild symptoms, catch covid end taking space ICU. whole idea prevent hospitals overwhelmed. hope enough people jump onboard. wont happen. stop fear mongering.

""what mega volcano erupted grand canyon destroyed US time asteroid hit asia wait tsunami destroyed europe africa! yah economy really bad!"" Hmm... suspect issue might little bit closer home. Sorry getting downvoted.

People really edge thing, totally right. need consider long term economic consequences.

Read article team responsible modelling prior Melbourne lockdown: 


That particular article instilled lot confidence. 

So goes again.

You set bar, simply chose worst 10 examples shat them. point everybody equally better, let's say x10 effort. would still shit bottom 10... competition bottom 10 booed top 10 praised. Completely ignoring country different capacities pressures affect fight virus.

Maybe could argue first world nation US bottom, yes, would make lot sense, shitting mostly third world countries shitty healthcare infraestructure first place pretty shitty do. Good, don’t want travel Australia NZ time soon. lots countries allowing Egyptians rn. teacher NZ school (I’m Grade 12) shit opinion vendetta me. problem effective like 3-6 months.. unless actually get everyone vaccinate short period (hint - won't) going ongoing issue regular shots non-deniers.

Other countries probably mandate honestly surprised proof recent vaccination required entry. Right, times long ago.

Something went askew WW2 generation. shady parts city

In Manhattan ghosttown. cold weather definitely deterred alot people going Reducing death ≠ eliminating corona. Corona still affect young people. infection may protect 6 months, forever may cause autoimmune disease instead fighting virus. second infection may worse first. Sweden half population Australia 6 times many deaths virus absolute nong. Plus Australia faced winter whereas Sweden summer. Melbourne's harsh lockdown started coldest point winter able bring numbers back control anyway. true wish people would talk openly.

Worst people denial trying show ""strength"" disregarding rules, theyre actually weakest bunch mentally. Great article, hopefully sign governments around world change focus prevent next pandemic life-altering measures like social distancing masks needed. restaurants bars closed that? offense anyone Reddit North AL thats hella redneck rural area hate anything isnt guns, God, beer. 

I family there. dont get along. 

Not South AL *better* least city holding steady cases generally likely wear masks. Decluttered version:

- Yeah he’s gonna 2 months advisers officials fear retaliating &amp; may right thing. It’s state Victoria significant 2nd wave Australia botched quarantine program. tried get control softer measures (just like lot now) much stricter set measures included home schooling, closure non essential retail hospitality except home delivery click collect.  Work home can. 8pm curfew 5 km radius travel. could legally leave home purchase food, health care work permit, hour day exercise (2 people household). visiting friends family. Big fines transgression. peak daily infection around 750 people still took 3 months control. rest Australia pretty much open time. 2 cases average per day last 2 weeks, 2 people hospital 130 known active cases population 5 million. still must wear masks whenever leave home. retail restaurants reopened many rules place. remote, low population density, high functioning health system, decent government still took long time work. awful blueprint must followed vaccine. fight it, delay it, cry it. costs lot either way. Good luck everyone facing horrible fucking situation. source support position poster. response needed.  Please go lock room, get rid internet cable never talk anyone Oh, come surprise. testing begun, simply information, everything hastily done lot uncertainly. people lamenting made sense albeit helpful. course testing done managed everything easier say fuzz about, thats hindsight.  probably want bridesmaid shitty brideszilla anyways  Worldwide eradication COVID literally impossible. that, we’d live 1 year lockdown least destroy humanity set us back couple hundred years, thousand years.

We eradicated one disease, smallpox, centuries work. simply can’t disease that’s almost year. PCR tests require labs capacity make proper finding. possibility process much tests short time period. purpose tests find soon possible, red zones isolate people soon possible. actually think regard, quick action valuable reserving weeks make findings everyone isolate. hey, lets wait 2 weeks see whether success not.

As crowding, looked bad TV, everyone standing proper distance, police enforced people generally mindful understanding. Afternoon first day already much better look. example, went testing place, time came there, registered myself, went test got certificate hands - 35 minutes. wife went next day managed 20 minutes. ye, people reasonable crowding non issue. would best compare trip grocery store. He's probably seen data I'd expect pretty accurate. sums went like this. eating went food. switched 15 quid Friday aditional good food asda. doubled food bill morw Yeah.. right.. transport problem. figuring deliver them, many needed, needed, etc....And course number trucks delivery companies already have, could easily job good enough. child even themself enter ICU understand. Technically pay tests taxes. Vättern round race around Sweden's second largest lake. cycle 315km feat even young healthy person. Wtf. driving xtrail spending 70 fortnight far drive? car ate 1/3rd income lol good read. Seems well organized. app never approved. good is, still years away using app medicine officially, except simple apps. can’t chuck anyone doctor. trained personnel, med students. people saying masks end live America saying anti-Trump rhetoric. They've got practical experience living mandatory mask society.

In Melbourne Australia rule may helped little, help bring case numbers introduced forced go full lockdown. 

The problem transmission occurs people's homes guests/family one going wear mask environment. realistic rule enforce. Kids even school. teachers run zoom meetings classes. Worked Australia. agree hard expect children use masks properly exercise social distancing. school attendance mask free regulations though? Cmon use ya braincells Floridians. Surely humidity damaging grey matter? Bro. go research actually made Spanish flu deadly. 

What's true covid find later. That's quick test, less accurate regular PCR test. wasn't, nobody would use long test. putting risk too. Hope family well taking precautions. Sounds comparable cost shutting down. list 5 sufficient. works asian countries without paying people work. Slowly surely Western countries realise path forward travel bubbles emerge them. Countries like US become isolated. approach physically they're excluded international travel. hope UK realise direction travel. teacher pandemic, sue ***them*** sheer stupidity causing infections students denial fabric reduce risk 85% virus ""no big deal"". pay commute anyway that's mute. cars still going there. live paycheck paycheck end month maybe save 50 quid. drive tesla dosnt realy fuel worry maintainance things I'm paying money cut 80 havr cut food. wife eat week like normaly do(and thsts usualy kabab ona Friday kind thing). I'm breadwinner go furlough that's fuked myth. Masks might help transmission occured people homes guests family. think wearing mask public?

Here Melbourne Australia, masks little effect changed full lockdown. Good hear. Conspiracy theories vaccines rampant Pakistan. 4% . YET. 2 week doubling time, work back 10%, 5 months 10 generations
10 5 2.5 1.25 0.625 0.312 0.156 0.078 0.039 0.019 0.01
So need 0.01% population infected reach 10% conditions. might say fairly conservative assumptions, eg. takes less 2 weeks double areas people dont take suitable precautions ? Wait guys don’t free tests?

Here aus kinda waltz free fever clinic, drive one. Give ya details, 24 hours later get result via text, officially health department. workplace must legally let stay home period Dutch person: that's true make good 90% population. entire society built personal convenience expense everybody else. Yes even get mask create inequality, argue. anything, masks hide face make people equal, less. Boris Redfield may people hated equally sides COVID spectrum.  Sorry what's thst? local library admits 20 people time. UK accurate (big discrepancy deaths excess mortality). France Belgium actually two countries accurate numbers. Tbh mins mostly online anyway idiot actually think businesses went under. living dream world think small businesses shut doors whilst forced pay rent 6+ months going lead closures. 

Plenty people lost jobs permenintetly anyone needs take walk big shopping strip see amount Sale signs went lockdowns. 

Idiots like know buy big chains likely support small businesses one thing pandemic kill lot small business strengthen position big business. quite sad. Yeah imagine. Places like Mexico Indonesia similar situations. There's process? Well world still uninfected otherwise, COVID case count would low. heard lot accept they’ll get covid likely fine. Kids age strong drive socialize they’re calculating risk factor - much rest society though. Wtf Americans....grow protect children. daughter chose school based, part, lack party scene. even take drink turned 21. works multiple jobs (doesn't need to) studies. close group friends also taking seriously. dare people fun!!!! /s Ireland going limit inbound arrivals Irish residents/citizens strictly enforced quarantine e.g. Aus/NZ Asia-style?

If we'll conversation months time. I’d like add something list helped Australia well:

Pay people stay home.

They doubled welfare many people, paid businesses keep people employed always need come in. forced businesses explain people couldn’t work home. actively fined businesses didn’t. 

It’s got flaws lot issues it’s great helping people Baldy Masks never precaution. must limit indoor exposure people outside bubble. How? Society trying get back normal. reducing death rate vaccinating groups listed, get close like April. Dr. Anthony Fauci explained main goal coronavirus vaccines isn’t block COVID-19 infections, instead stop severe cases life-threatening complications.   LOL sure eager spend several weeks serving time homejail - without due process crime - get allowed absolutely nothing. fucking chance. Short lockdown, be, give back life freedom. buts, alternatives. then? Genuinely curious. *sigh* Beautifully said Empathy precisely showing. research evidence loss smell taste associated milder course disease. loss smell last long time small percentage people, increase risk depression. people start get sense smell back 1 week, 5% report recovery 4 weeks. Hopefully vaccine ticket pandemic shitty “new normal”. Regardless happens, partisan Supreme Court now. That’s bigger presidency wanna do. Several students city (In UK) given £10,000 fines organising similar parties. proud refusing party college??? Spot - govt political courage conviction use island status close borders.

The tricky thing see lorries. disrupting flow freight without cases drivers leaking would difficult accept. handled interstate travel Aus. Surely beyond capability put checks additional monitoring.

Can't least try come solution adopt Aus/NZ model. either guys perpetual circuit breakers next year. Depends mask wear. N95 P100, good go. it’s shitty surgical cloth mask, won’t help much flu cold season. Also, need sick every build immune system, eventually get cold, less severe usual. Unreal. sued gross negligence. Pandemic decide over, simply that. very, skeptic/cynical/knew exactly going happen said “14 days slow spread.” However willing take extended spring break long that. okay it, though knew beginning. I’m glad hear say this, looks like people starting change tune gives sliver hope. There's going 2nd testing week one. Stop bringing idiots spotlight, then. strenghtens American anti-intellectual culture. Bring professional people smart discussions spotlight. lil’ cold every actually good you. getting disease long time severly harms immune system, get cold again, much worse hadn’t gotten cold long time got recent cold. lockdown advice good. FHM needs grow stones tell public transit increase frequency departures cleaning. Can't give penny pinching advice individuals. fairness, could possibly predicted every single scientist doctor said would come true? complete surprise. completely wrong. Atalein stated receieved information.

It indeed difficult epistemologically parse Swedish advice exactly are. Partly regulation, partly advice. say anything it, can't wrong.

What right countries would call lockdown, things similar lockdown. example local library closed closed weeks. think libraries closed, library decided interpret new restrictions way.  really, considering it’s probability *upon catching virus* death, probability getting Covid first place. age bracket hospitalization rate likely extremely low, meaning lack care likely increase much. far know now, perpetuates pandemic unless continue vaccinate everybody ASAP. Fuck, want go back Texas Torchy’s! lockdown start 2 weeks ago expected. should’ve gone harder though, cinemas museums still open, there’s talk closing places week. wish hard 1 month lockdown done it. true covid. Deaths significantly delayed infection. selective pressure kill host. COVID could easily become deadly without significantly reducing ability spread. like people scared? No, takes weeks antibodies develop. loss smell highly specific symptom Covid overlaps less respiratory symptoms, assume positive. Take care best both. Fauci media month behind idiots like me.

Since millions idiots internet month Fauci, means he's basically lying, reality part decade planning dealing novel coronavirus.

People catching lie people, tell weeks months someone solves problems them, nothing. Congrats media public health doctors! also funny many times year heard ""expert"" saying ""we entering deepest phase pandemic"". Seriously. Goddamn idiots. statement can't possible even remotely true. provide source this? seen evidence RCT studies back claim far know. declared PHEIC Feb 12th.

A PHEIC declared Jan 30, Feb 12. Start leaving doom gloom sub! mothefucking cancer, downvote us hell.

You FUCKING PROBLEM, human trash age bro? weight? preexisting conditions?

2 three unreversable (or least hard cure preexisting condition). start losing weight overweight/obese shall help immune system fight disease, making somewhat immune, buying time vaccine. reason 7 cases city 3 million political rally (by extremist right wing groups) August 15th. otherwise Korea probably would looking single digits instead triple digits right First numbers wrong, proves bothered research.

Herd immunity started growing virus day one stop last person gets sick, that's wasted statement.

The kids statement false many statement begs ask happens rest.

How define ""great"" therapies? US abundant supply them? supplies easily moved hot zones? spoke ignorance, stupidity. even education guarantee one rely ""personal responsibility"" avoid pitfalls current society.

As someone grew education good nutritional habits, era processed foods became ubiquitous everywhere, confirm sugar addictive substance. 

I say humility. I, easily able stay thin mid-30's, started gaining weight could stop overeating, knowledge good bad. 

So yes, anyone thinks people can't get sucked spiral refined carbohydrate particularly sugar addiction fooling nature problem. 

If recognize sheer *volume* sugars manufactured foods, high level marketing dollars spent sell us, difficulties able access healthier alternatives them, ignoring happening world today.

""Personal responsibility"" fine catch phrase always translate real world. Hard imagine US ever equaling Europe's rates infections going right now--Today, Switzerland reported 3 day total 21,926 infections, that's 833,188 US cases equivalent, 277,729 day--Belgium yesterday US equivalent 474,000, today 330,000 cases--Last week Czech Republic US equivalent 550,000 cases 1 day(but yesterday 121,000)--Netherlands yesterday 168,000 US equivalent, today 160,000--France yesterday US equivalent 232,000 cases(high last week 260,000 US cases equivalent)---Austria yesterday 182,000 US equivalent(today 151,754)--UK 113,000 US equivalent, I'm bit surprised went Tier 4 lockdown mods sub probably right wing apologists people tend want control behavior others. 


Seriously though, mods definitely represent views average redditor sub tend lock threads like self righteous pearl clutcher people start getting riled (as every right 8 months dumpster fire refer democracy). tried link Reuters article one point post got taken b/c automod told credible news outlet. Thanks mod. politely wish people spreading disinformation banned. okay? didnt canada learn SARS1?

I live Canada never ever affected Sars all. think even case Saskatchewan I'll wear mask public indoor spaces that's it. Two years much ask. pandemic going stop people partying Halloween lol call lockdown minor sacrifice? 

Yeah worked hard achieve world without things like ww2 sacrifices made back days. normal anymore. 

And nah, american evidence common sense Something like 70% US overweight obese. Ignoring pre-existing conditions, anyone uses weight reason one deaths acceptable basically saying okay 70% country dying. 37th comin feel like wasted entire year got decade older done server host side....there plethora places go get commercial webpage hosted literally ZERO need client, case newspaper care things. Sure talking fortune 500 companies dealing lot eu personal data business, selling good service etc understand youre coming cost hassle argument. simply host news webpage...the arguments dont fit

Once comes back simply cheap free services using instead squeeze much money every avenue. makes sense im sure small local news service, means selling cookies ad adspaces scrape everything.....

Like make sound like jump huge hoops, really dont yes cases makes absolute sense bother given target audiences etc, cases like clearly one reason ad cookie scrape reasons. get space have, things eu bans need revenue 

Like lets real second lol downvote? can't fathom something simple washing hands correct way stop spread infection. Look breaking chain infection hand washing. around years years. I’m teacher work school instructor. changed work watch 12 kids, one teacher room allowing kids wear masks sitting down. 2 weeks later caught COVID. work 6 months, come back work caught two weeks. Masks need mandatory worn times. joyless existence brought upon seeing America turn lard land. kid 8 8 chins. fucking excuse. Exactly this. Yeah, bad problems, problems future. hospital infrastructure literally collapsing, solve immediate problem. Like said, preventatives, could avoided hospitals stressed prevented long term problems. short sighted. sucks people pay freedom today. Actions consequences. Hope worth it. child break cycle? entire life brought steady diet soda, processed garbage, McDonalds suddenly make switch healthy living? teach stuff schools - least comprehensive way kids understand apply daily lives.

Let's stop judgmental attitude. Even discussing adult, weight loss healthy lifestyle bit complex ""just stop drinking soda!"" plenty overweight people drink soda. Also Americans truly view food dining entertainment. get bored stuff faces. Blame food marketing culture consumption that. Sometimes wonder bother trying explain things lay people.


you convinced bother, thank you. may know already, people general aware [too much vitamin cause kidney stones, among problems Actually countries went lockdown starting pick back up, school, holidays thanksgiving (Canada's October), Halloween, fed covid. Canada law people supposed quarantine law isnt enforced There's nothing done people like these... news, news outlet (liberal conservative), children get spread virus many people asymptomatic. People hold beliefs unlikely touched PR. people fall ridiculous category. Flat earth type people.

I agree. 100%. said could there's much do. expect good PR affect people, expect good PR keep views much margin limit impact. Sort like ""herd immunity"", social matter spin that, that's weak ass PR. boils ""we're clueless"".

You're 100% correct, type PR position would cause professional roll eyes complain. Whatever communication strategy came whining, however, would 100% better radio silence we've getting, opinion. 

I'm disagreeing anything said, nothing I've suggested silver bullet stretch. I'm saying that, realm incremental activities reevaluated make sure we're ready future pandemic, impact public communications public health agency emphasized. Great list. I'm glad blowing candles birthday cake gone. always super gross. Yeah, you’re right. way wrote sounded callous. course feel badly family especially child. obvious September trends would inevitably force another lockdown? 

It wasn’t students causing reemergence, although fair share spreading. 90% comment makes sense, lost ""corn isotopes"". 

Knowing know basic chemistry, corn element. elaborate meant ""corn isotope""? thought Americans basic education science. talk vaccine ending either, done. winter over, I'm risking it. care anymore. way mentally another year this. Elective. They're still emergency (while beds) expect beds last much longer. Another problem people less time plan prepare meals due parents work. hurts families, couples single people too. hundreds millions doses mass-produced right now. get widely available vaccine (likely spring), imagine everyone wants one able get one within 2 months available. I'm young adult good health (ie: chronic illnesses, healthy heart lungs), I'm still obese genuinely afraid kind havoc Covid could cause caught 

I huge kid means, *really* wish built better habits youth. parents moderately healthy, served food whatever portions wanted. Mom lost bunch weight Atkins brother took second third helpings Kraft mac n cheese ate mandatory amount veggies side. 20s I've stopped looking every meal chance eat I'm uncomfortably full, looked make carbs protein 'side' meal.

These habits establishee early lives, makes immensely difficult build healthy diet actually sticks. even possible...? Kristi Noem South Dakota wrote “there way stop virus” 
 
From governor endorsed Sturgis bike rally, resisted shutdowns interests public health, [blamed increased testing overwhelmed 
This play ratfuck narrative, going ""it's overblown/a hoax"" ""there's nothing could've done"", avoiding responsibility actively making things worse. 
 
edit: Also, blatantly false late. everyone puts mask best distance, shit start dying lots deaths disability prevented. Korea also shut schools IMMEDIATELY Canada thought whole thing going big deal. (I can't remember... back November think?)

We commenting overeating paranoid. Look optimist here. kiwis leading normal lives, can't go typical holiday Bali Australia US right now. far normal. Kiwi dependent international tourism depleting savings.

Read hundreds Samoans homeless USA due similar border prisonment policies. indians stuck airports elsewhere.

The border restrictions cruel. Stop defending think anyone saying ""deserved"" it. pointed weight comorbidity generally bemoaning Corporate America destroying poor people's health addictive yet low-quality food. covid chance, wake call species, look one another realize families different others.

we collectively sent call voicemail deleted message without listening. nurse works covid patients arguing adults. amount stupidity amongst adults country damn high. referring ifs conspiracy theories. 

I saying, lost votes support electoral college and/or popular vote. 

Sure take things supreme court arguments legal standing. wants call winner election day refuses mail ballots count date. legal. say whatever wants, supreme court course biased, doubt allow conspiracy theories hold. Fat people attack tax payers. Exactly this. aren’t/weren’t essential, people work make money survive. hope everything works you. wife lucky work whole time since March. Owning home Northern California would gotten tight quickly continued work. 

I think least sub people wanting full lockdown either A) work home great ability B) still living Mom Dad spending money. real. evidence that? even seems possible might make things worse shirt term people might take virus seriously knowing there's vaccine weird one maybe dont understand panic. PLease keep reading think swear.

A Co-worker mine knows someone friend contact 2 people virus.

Now work wants us get tested. Isnt bit much? Like direct contact all. think top?

Well go test thursday nonetheless really? Anyone thinks makes sense? Ive seen mass gathering every saturday park, mostly climate activists stuff- seem fine.
I work music store, guess around people entertain themselves. 

It doesnt seem terrible home hobbies passionate family enjoy company of. Godfuckingdamn it... best shape states. look averages. Look % population classified obese. Almost 24% population obese.

**2019 Adult Obesity Rates State**: Also rural Illinois seeing shit. None businesses actually shutting down. Pritzker going start punishing fuckers we're ever going beat thing I’m sorry statement cop-out blaming victim. perfect example class snobbery. 70% Americans can’t afford $1000 emergency. safety net place option make income isolating it’s either go work risk getting sick get by, become homeless hungry. He's Top 5 best domain everyone says he's wrong less knowledgeable him, try find where's issue. work ICU acute care? many roles hospital skills work ICU, acute, ER likely hours cut hospitals prepare worst case scenario seen states right now. wondering beginning COVID treated differently Polio. think fact COVID patients primarily older locked away public eye. can't ignore crippled dying children way. 

 terrible politics also big part people taking seriously. better yet, tackle mental health crisis country instead finding scapegoat grab power. Fuck yeah I’m ok that. Millions New Zealanders get lead normal lives. chose abroad return home writing wall that’s you. Also return home takes time.

Also I’m America. one hasn’t returned home point knows full well chance get stuck. Everyone talking professions, titles. (As in: ""A friend who's nurse thinks stupid thing..."" Nursing profession.)

Someone gets doctorate someone physician use title ""Dr."" certain contexts historical reasons. people doctorates *profession* doctor. MD professional degree (as opposed doctorate academic degree).

If someone PhD geology works geologist, would profession ""geologist"" ""doctor.""

If asked someone ""What work?"" person replies ""I'm doctor"" means work physician.

If person replies ""I'm nurse"" could mean LPN, RN, even NP. bar ""being nurse"" profession high.

Do go around non-professional casual contexts calling everyone ""licensed professional nurse""/""registered nurse"" (""Oh gosh, day registered nurse friend said..."") word use? human people say ""nurse."" profession ""nursing."" economised batched testing. Total cost lot individuals pay vs collective bargaining. Probably since month two away vaccines deployed  People tired trying stay alive keep loved ones alive, apparently....

Scary.

It's much effort people. culture get weak? wonder society overweight unhealthy. one wants work eat right exercise.

It's hard. like this. Ugh.

It's easy, I'd rather work upfront. much easier enjoyable go life putting actual work. always worth it. Actually majority businesses operate degree social distancing measures hate break that's gonna life least next years longer Yeah cant even handle one anymore. Like, truly. Stop it. that's really reductionist stupid way look things sound like condescending prick. person drink soda mean every 13-year-old going agency think smart like that. everyone parents teach healthy habits. Also know tell drinking sugary drinks going suddenly make healthy thin. kid dead, perspective. even case dropped, homeless people advocates say ticketing amounts harassment often forces people move around direct contradiction CDC’s pandemic guidance. Reality general &amp; covid19 particular pays exactly zero attention people try score points semantics. K Depends government country question. think I’m opposed favor of? I’m fine masks, social distancing, extra cleaning measures. I’m worried anymore large scale lockdowns. Trick treating pretty safe, IMHO. took seven year-old around neighborhood. wore mask, socially distanced, outside, people put candy pre-made bags tables. riskiest thing neighbor reached shake hand instinctively reciprocated. almost home, went washed hands really well. Honestly, feel like going store dangerous. I'm also high school teacher back full classes, think terrible idea, maybe tolerance risk skewed point. realize Trump doing? stopped inbound flights nation started plague, liberals called xenophobic racist.

Legally, power federal government mandate masks lockdowns. states. agree. back first starting, Fauci saying wear masks. me, ridiculous, since mask would obviously catch whatever breathe out. one first people job wear mask back February/March. 


Keep mind recommendation beginning wear mask sick. assumed beginning could effectively spread covid symptomatic true infections diseases. 

Being able spread acute respiratory disease multiple days experiencing symptoms basically unheard Covid-19. learned important pre-symptomatic spread disease though, recommendations wear mask changed ""only sick/experiencing symptoms"" ""everyone"". result weak leadership government support. result policy tens thousands Kiwis stuck abroad even till now, causing massive suffering families. course imprisonment everyone crossed border requires managing inflow trickle. also,the outflow basically nil also,causing suffering binational families 

At US scale, would millions Americans stuck abroad till today, homeless foreign land, immigrants stuck US unable visit families abroad last eight months well foreseeable future regardless circumstances

You're okay suffering? One would necessarily lead other, however. churn soldiers meant virus constantly evolved become deadly *and* soldiers also carried back general populace therefore spread. 'the opposite' all, foregone conclusion way virus evolved. find numerous sources say virus spread along soldiers. understand tired pandemic, it’s probably best find middle ground wait things actually happen. Back July/August talk vaccine approval September, maybe November, maybe end year. flatten curve, vaccine, it’s vaccine masks etc etc. goals deal pandemic going change new information, doesn’t mean anyone moving goalposts. time people really digging new normal kind hopefulness continued lockdown etc surely frustrating people struggling this. think temper expectations take things one day time; hope best prepare worst. Well, negative test testing negative PCR test soft lockdown Slovakia right now. go grocery shopping doctors, can't go work go shopping non-essentials.

There's significant number people went employer required it, though us. headline news exception extremely rare. Hope takes anxiety away. kid 99.996% survival, likely 99.98% probably even higher. Chanced hospitalization long term problems like extremely low too, especially kid. okay. Wear mask. Really? never got flu vaccine year I’m exactly known wash hands time. I’ve gotten flu like 10 years. pretty shitty situation, aware need extraordinarily tactful delivering public announcements. makes jobs lot harder, reality circumstances living in. Although trials identify lot adverse effect never catch anything. 3900 30 million people got condition would extremely difficult trial discover it. depends. young children, would generally agree. teenagers, difficult parents entirely control kid eating. difficult access good obesity supports like therapy. Even supports, difficult problem people overcome. woman playground took mask use phone coughed whole time. Clearly, ill care even laughed mock coughed people moved away. 

Everyone else masked selfish spreaders persist. 

It depressing made realize people selfish help us get situation.

When leave mask wearing open interpretation, people take sorts liberties cheat system. 

It needs mandate, clear one everyone knows law. never happen here. depressing. Bring us choices come magic expectation society changing overnight. Ugh, fucking bullshit. know virus traveling around world like this, people suffer die, I'm tired inaction causing much unnecessary death. take Trump administration could finally get someone power actually LEAD SOMETHING protect US! understand called pandemic US pulledout right ? great problems almost everything face lie psychology. someone battles weight typically roots something deeper psychological makeup person insists big deal sends kids school symptoms...or maybe class another kid may symptoms. Political affiliations, jobs chosen, personal expression.....everything.

All rooted real reasons ""why"" software running.

The physical human machine runs emotional software.

If software glitchy machine operate poorly. True, cutting school many consequences cutting social activities. school cut, parents stay home can't easily work, even home office, name one. point. saying staying healthy possible important ever, never hear advice end.

Also, rude. wouldn’t needed lockdown people taken responsibility themselves, distanced wore mask. 

Know Japan Taiwan well? tradition social responsibility flap jaws “rights”. haven’t see right ignorantly put others jeopardy. There's reason hobbies retired folks pick almost always something social (golf, bingo, travel, volunteering, etc). nobody wants work whole life spend year time left Earth alone away family friends. 

Obviously mean ""ignore ongoing pandemic things anyway"" mean ""let's find way people enjoy safe manner."" poor kid may kind imbalance system made harder.

Maybe, unlikely. vast majority obese people way due poor choices. Canada Australia lot common geographically (apart extreme hot/extreme cold thing) culturally, federation states thing going politically.  think fair compare Australia Canada handled this. Although long border US complicate things Canada source outside infection. get low initial exposure, say 10 viruses get mask, body still learns fight virus much safer levels much likely able fight off.

If get higher initial exposure, say 100k viruses maskless close talking covid charley pub bad ventilation soccer 5 hours, already well way overrunning immune system. many teachers willing kill? Stop using John Q. Taxpayer fund personal life. believe bit theatre done prove point. way understood this; CCP overarching authority China. However, localized governments (not unlike countries governed), jurisdiction areas. Chinese people worker bee drones follow every command, despite Western perceptions are. quite obstinate like, say, non mask wearers countries. local people chose obey quarantine rules repeated warnings, local authority decided exercise authority. doors cut open later, message delivered. Yes, does. says direct second hand contact? 


What's problem getting tested? heart scarring overwhelmingly common side effect covid. happens expect shave atleast decade off.

I assume referring myocarditis common side effect. Myocarditis occurs viral infections (such flu) duration symptom varies presumably based virus complicating factors.

The length time myocarditis present COVID-19 patients long-term prognosis unanswered. simply enough data know this, likely years.

The Atlantic interesting article examines data, cardiologist interpretations, level concern warranted. good read: curve great prevent mass loss life doesnt protect me, individual, alls said done. Ill keep hermit get vaccine avoid less ideal ououtcomes value length quality life.

That's perfectly reasonable. err side caution well. want make already scary disease scarier science prove it. Caution good. Fear debilitating. pandemic defined infection rates. need wait see infection rates go declare pandemic over.

Blaming middle man embarrassment. Hospitals losing income can't perform lucrative elective surgeries.  Yes, true.

Talking US whole sort loses granularity. Okay BC good hold coronavirus compare Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland then. understanding (I medical professional) based read doctors already lot better treating covid spring, better therapeutics coming. is, fewer people get dying medical professionals know lot in, say, April.

Even example incredibly narrow minded, many children spectrum picky eaters, picky eaters, bigger problem food perseveration obsession. Even manage lock food up, eventually children get older smarter able open anything have. calling abuse parents dedicate obscene amount time energy keeping child overeating.

Just something unhealthy mean abuse. worked field like this, throw word like abuse around cavalier attitude. It’s late. virus contained, takes work. accurate RRT-PCR tests? feels like warned dangers lockdowns recently, ideas why?

Probably real dangers lockdowns, people deserve know them.

The fact gets painted “people want go bars get haircuts” absurd. fact people arguing can’t put dollar value human lives equally absurd. real costs lockdown need taken account, balanced actual benefits. 13-year-old eighth grader goes Washington middle School Seattle.. ""wants one""

Ha ha. people anti-vaxxers. anyplace western hemisphere succeeded? far tell, success almost completely geographic phenomenon, confined eastern hemisphere, many nations, whether islands not, succeeded, seemingly irrespective race, creed, color, national origin, political regime.

Death 100% recovered outcomes though. virus causing lot damage bodies, people issues months later. friend early 40’s permanent heart damage now.  Using it. still Europe. get american sites. No.

The answer isn’t yes.

More 1% currently deployed.

More 1% involved medicine.

More 1% maintaining power systems.

More 1% logistics.

Before answer, think it. Well like said, civilization fucked up. I’ve pulling weights since mid March, barely leave house, keep 12ft distance, barely visit family, etc. 

The opportunity shutoff spread timely manner long past us. best hope weakens becomes like average cold. take though, since keeps mutating. 

In place like Sweden, aimed herd immunity, several deaths, claiming accomplished it, may nought. new strain spreads globally we’ll simply back square zero. sure. One argument suddenly realized seriousness Covid taken action caught it, would helped chances significantly. he’s unable admit wrong, took wrong path. one going go restaurants, movie theaters, bars dine services rates large enough keep businesses open long 'anti-mask' 'anti-lockdown' spreaders keep cases rising.

If cooking home potentially dying people choose cooking home drive / carry out. exception things like bars tourist college towns large enough concentration people decided personal enjoyment important personal communal health.

So claim people basements, people actually homes, living lives like normal. people hardest hit people already bottom luxury home, ones funding businesses ones working them.

Either way, long-lasting immunity infection.  late mandate masks things bad. 

Bars, restaurants, superspreader nature places need remain closed. Event halls need closed. Masks need mandated.

We constantly wait last moment take rational action, disaster. Action needs maintained whatever keeps r0 one much can, essentially indefinitely. may vaccine. may not.

I confused saying thing consider part BC atlantic canada? I'm confused. Like wrote one respondents, freedom means nothing unless people willing give freedom right time, right cause. can't live meaningful existence without socializing problem you.


Do really need dignify statement? really advice somewhat similar spot. worked healthcare bit too. last couple months. would sanitize wash hands soo much days later skin would try peel. One thing found helped lot Cerave moisturizing cream. tried things lotions stuff work best far. 

Again. know help, working healthcare intact skin pretty important along hands clean. cream helps hands tolerate level cleaning better less hesitant clean hurt anymore suspicious all. two vaccine news like start flooding subreddit People travel time perfectly legal. stick. know reddit loves thy mask even play cards perfectly still contract virus spread it.

Redditors wanting criminalize refusal various measures juvenile naive criminal justice system works mean weakening Britain then? Sadly, RIGHT child die order tide turn. School shootings prime example that. 

Nothing gonna change right person dies, affected catastrophic way. living self-obsessed (at least openly) time one care affected. 

What think might happened Ivanka's kids caught it, died permanently affected? would whole different world right now. get examples special cough sound? kids virtual- it’s great. live class sessions, still getting great education Individual freedoms United States unlimited, especially time emergency. subject police powers state public good. enumerated numerous times SCOTUS, traditionally conservative branch government. elderly want sacrifice last bit life living like either. grandmother mid 80s back about. literally said, I'm going live fear. would rather die now. know reddit pull numbers like that. children Autism overweight obese.. 1 54 children Autism. 400k children Autism also Obese. 1 1000 number would 13k, 400k. Furthermore, pointed developmental disabilities, mentioned two many. Look stats MANY children disabilities obese.

Lastly, also ignoring poverty, affects 12 million children. happens think, problem disabilities easily identifiable from, say, picture new article child dying COVID everyone jumps child abuse. November

 


Bro 2nd, give time Happy birthday, hope 2021 fantastic make terrible, terrible year. different enough original vaccines lose effectiveness? happen till January 20 least first death age 18 state. 

Eight months first &lt;18 state pass? Ummmm... Yep. Alas theres many inconsistencies (and lack enforcement) around. Plus pandemic fatigue.... mess humans weren’t meant go long without socialization. 

You're kidding right? think family farms/ranches majority people lived cities blew up? Many still do, maybe teach something. quite literally invitation Jeff Bezos save day manufacturing capacity delivery infrastructure steps ""businessman"" void Republican party would need fill order viable presidential candidate.

Oh god anyone written sci Fi dystopia happened lobbyists ultimate lobby became president? introvert nice little family, lots hobbies, steady income agree, that's case everyone. Lots people depend service entertainment industries work, extroverts general suffering. mention plenty introverts extroverts alike stuck shitty families/living situations.

Personally, really miss extended family looking forward family dinners again, whenever happen. 20% enough herd immunity, would cause new cases decrease? Studies show [masks work reduce Imagine 18 year old kid, High School, 1944. asked government serve Marines. orders take island Okinawa, engages one bloodiest battles Pacific Theater. shot, bleeds death beach. mother comfort him, father say goodbye - dies alone, agony.

Was freedom taken away?

Freedom means absolutely nothing, unless people willing sacrifice freedom right time, right cause. cases 3 days now... Hate break work. Jesus christ dont spout garbage. Trump got exclusive experimental drugs can't even look at. lot drawbacks lockdowns... 

But happen enough adherence (and enforcement) essential measures (like mask wearing, physical distancing, limits gatherings). 

Like EU... got covid control. they've basically partying several months. 

Well... covid gone. exponential spread ramps up, gets late stop it. 

I hope state Cali weathers better lot places long run. got numbers down... lot things still closed. lot measures still place. People mostly following them. hope people get used ""new normal"" vaccines come.  Again, ultimately wouldn’t made difference. Even countries lock down, still fully normal. case fully locking would mean could go back normal, would angry country. nature virus means locking meaningless, China caused virus. happened Whitehouse taking data? anywhere releasing like CDC been? meant sorrysalesman, you, case it’s unclear want Texans hire competent coach GM Bill Brien ruined team fundamental problem health ""experts"" operate theoretical echo chambers often make base case assumptions rest audience (i.e. general public) behaves way people like would behave. little bit like engineer designing product confused people using way engineer would.

Ultimately, different COVID restrictions effectiveness matter lot depending person/place's culture, employment situation, economy, age, health, etc. 

Asking orthodox religious people extremely tight knit groups large families cease activities essentially value life perhaps life HAPPEN, happened. would like asking tech people give cell phone, internet connection computer. Good luck that. 

History full many examples happens demand things banned. happens go underground. ban public gatherings, go private. United States passed prohibition alcohol, went underground. reason restrictions work simply sends stuff restrict sight underground. essentially nothing that. 

Governments health officials one chance March/April get large scale compliance, did, one chance only. accept lot blame this, got people stop lives 2-3 months cases, part bargain prepare happens after.

Prohibition mentality place, least United States, seems like Europe too, life. realistic assume anything else point. People largely done complying, happily public things closed doors. stuff happens time Muslim type countries - conservative outside - much raucous internally. Welcome society head 2021. 

So then? believe focus needs shift surgically isolating protecting vulnerable. People concerned risk government level support need. given PPE actually protect others - BS cloth masks. Making sure need survive. Perhaps subsidize deliveries essential items. 

There needs point reckoning opinion. restrictions rapidly diminishing returns going work. Full stop.  People sub rly think last past spring, wack COVID infections except Brazilian got placebo. I’m former nursing assistant. nothing new. People don’t take health seriously general. worked hospital Utah. People drive stupidly first time snows every single year accidents hospitalizations every single year it. would think point people northern Utah would epiphany snow road = slow never seems happen. flu shots every single year hospitals fill little kids old people got flu refused flu shot. saw things moved California. family works healthcare Iowa thing happens there. Maybe people California, Utah Iowa prone nursing dumb rest country smart. knows. Americans general ignore health take granted. draw short straw get covid. flu. universe decides remind hiking pacific crest trail nothing clothes back hiking experience bad idea get one makes news hikers find side road. US keep chugging along... Well yes. went global epicenter low, manageable, containable cases. achieve that, place wants contain virus succeed. Mail I'm concerned about...nor groceries. sitting fridge cupboard day two use them, produce getting washed regardless, wash hands prep eating anyways...

 I'm getting snack store gas station I'm out, I'm still wiping packaging. extra squirt od sanitizer hands use excess wrapper. idea many people handled container put basket. Thus 'for Johnson faults lot' part.

And yes taking heed compared COVID rallies Trump Bolsonaro undermines efforts country every chance gets. 90%+ accuracy Finally, good news. Username checks. Asshole. article fucked up. One bits advice give start emergency fund. living paycheck paycheck, kind means can't. I'm CURIOUS happening. I'm seeing intelligent, empathetic people know love make questionable choices believe things make sense. Like family member following rules, wearing mask, complaining people seem care anyone, etc., somehow problem leaving locked city lunch indoors restaurant 2 hours away lockdown place.

There's kind psychology going on, beyond overload contradictory information. I'm sure different people affected different motivations (rationalizing priority comfortable; translating general pandemic fear something controllable; know I'm armchair) really want get inside everyone's head find is. Case fatality rate infection fatality rate? flu, infections go unrecorded. actively looking like covid-19. Ah, *white* Americans ""inconvenienced"" internment camps. spring cold n flu season ending it? 

That assertion mate, mine. Congratulations, played yourself. 

The graph clearly shows Covid Results, comparing flu numbers demonstrates downturn infection numbers viruses spread similar flu (like Covid) normal seasonal flu fluctuations, normal flu numbers also got smashed year. 

You'd able make connection, could remember argument. remember word ""reactivation"" sis, ""reinfection"" get another strain ;) They're talking last year something up. Yes anticipated hypothesized supported data. No, response. chose take petty shit everybody polarized many people assume anyone taking virus seriously scared, panicing hiding sky falling world ending, chill care little many people it. reveal percentage tested positive asymptomatic? breakdown age (especially asymptomatics) ? community spread entire time, low. Also keep mind Pareto principal states spend 20% effort yield 80% results. latest Australia effort need 100 day lockdown. imagine NYC also massive vaccination program week prior instituting pandemic containment efforts. think would enough burn virus. 

Keep mind, enough stop community spread one city. burn everywhere. Otherwise, someone bring back NYC playing viral groundhog day again. need global strategy..something first started. late. Dude you.need another ban mental health Sorry working UPS making sure packages got delivered couldnt afford stay home, pay college, pay housing.

But go people working low paying jobs pandemic sitting home, working home huge house making 6 figures. work provide sick leave doctor's note? actually do, that's little known fact. Massive federal government subsidies given farmers time little work keep afloat. We’re still giving credibility? anyone paying attention lmao. BC got lucky big super spreader events early kept numbers low summer late August. Since things ramping we're regularly 200 new cases day nearing 300. We're well we're slower get started. provinces money support cost policies would really help put end thing. Who's going pay comprehensive contact tracing program? loss tax revenue businesses shuttered? would great [the God abandoned us.

The government forsaken us. 

Fuck America. Stop bragging chipotle eating maguffin! Federalism nothing it. 

The reason largely inability get testing supplies scale testing. Everything getting cotton swabs, chemical resin short supply. 

Why that, chickens coming home roost. decided outsource large chunk manufacturing Asia. buy goods international market compete every country world goods. 

Asian countries better sufficient domestic supply serve needs. terribly lack domestic supply goods services. 

Even Europe, Eastern Europe better manufacturing hub. Western Manufacturers moved east joined EU. 

All talk US Canada using military style production produce PPE, Testing Supplies Medical Equipment moot factories across Canada US shut shipped overseas. state 12 million people? live New Jersey, people masks grocery stores essential businesses go Walmart mall people care see lot people going parties gatherings stuff like that's probably cases surging Trump wasn’t right anything. experts right. Everyone knew virus could turn seasonal. Like said, yeah I’m sorry seem like nice guy stats support can’t act like recovered individuals like immediate risk reinfection. founders built Constitutional structure times national emergency unique circumstances, President Congress take drastic action protect safety country. time test that, it. basically war. lost WWI. Take drastic action, let someone sue, let go Supreme Court. 

If take drastic action send innocent Japanese Americans internment camps without trial violate constructional rights (and action ruled Constitutional courts drastic necessary war time action), great precedent take good public health action save may end quarter million American lives.  Dude yeah I’m sorry seem like nice guy stats support can’t act like recovered individuals like immediate risk reinfection. easy test Cell immunity widely deployed? Seems better antibody test. Exactly. Easy import overseas reship US Initial (China): Draconian lockdown main hotspot Wuhan, movement restricted even across \*neighbourhoods\*; starvation warded military (or civilian well organized) deliveries food right people's doors. also took resources continent-sized state called legion doctors nurses across country Wuhan treat everyone hotspot there. Reportedly, extensive efforts voluntary groups civil society well... ran conflict government, leading getting vaguely pissed other. Everywhere else: Extensive social distancing enforced primarily fines public shaming (as well as... orwellian announcer drones)

Initial (Vietnam): Distrust news coming China already heavily guarded border, followed preemptive military lockdown multiple counties border help massive army (they technically troops China...) community-minded people (from I've heard, normal Vietnamese people care badger neighbours literally everything).

Current (China): literally anything, anywhere, need use contact tracing app. Even enter McDonalds, sign presence, register using app, present person door certified 'virus free' test. actually pathetically easy everything's already done waving smartphone around scanning QR codes unless poor rural village, apparently.

Everyone tested semi-regular basis via pooling tests - whilst Chinese tests shown sketchy af quality, China manufactures many tests afford this. moment anyone gets confirmed positive, everywhere they've via contact tracing app gets locked down, anyone places get locked going anywhere else pending new test. Orwellian panopticon? Yeah, pretty much. think us west guts let system go far.

Current (Vietnam): know much less Vietnam, afaik simply 'lol keep borders closed what's hard that?'.

In short, took drastic action described wartime mobilization done west; shy wartime mobilization societies AFAIK.

South Korea AFAIK exactly things China, except every often, inane far-right cult 'Christian' church would violate quarantine proceed seed thousand new cases.

Taiwan seems much, much less contact tracing app, much, much sending police people whose phones turn off. make sure they're deliberately trying hide could sick. ""dual."" What's word hundreds time? Yeah, island would helpful, sharing border President Super Spreader I’m pretty sure narrative US particularly bad Covid response vs European countries falling apart recent weeks. US half dozen European countries similar situation. US medium bad instead worst. going wrong vaccines far? think little believing trusting science. know heard, people developing complications thus far testing.  Guardian wrong. Lockdowns necessary people like these: look pubs see people wearing mask, gathered around virus. mostly people giving shit others wanting thing. lockdowns see gangs people city/town centers ""making freedom"" lockdown sort punishment naughty child. 

It's socially responsible, virus especially rampant west. leadership vacuum. US dragged continues make worse bad leadership turned something ap0litical p0litic@l sideshow.

Stop conspiracy. CDC statements freely available online. speaking CDC, cite CDC. learn virus seems behave like HIV. possible you’re infected virus stays body permanently? doesn’t say anything 90+% accuracy would anticipate vaccine topic details need outlined specifically terms rollout impact loosening restrictions. think anyone released details yet.  ## HIDE HOUSES WILLINGLY GOVERNMENT MAKE YOU.  Asia? 99% people Japan wearing masks basically since around end January. live that's source. Warnings Covid-19 went work January.

I imagine nearby countries like Taiwan much different. No. number infected matter certain point.

Right now, reason numbers matter X cases leads deaths Z hospitalizations. exponential spread, X goes up, leads Z skyrocketing.

But vaccine signficiantly reduces symptoms health outcomes, name game changes entirely.

If get flu levels, even better...common cold levels...we good go.

There billion common cold cases year US. That's 3 per person!

We talk next impact health care systems.

The number cases matter that.

Same ultimately true Covid mass vaccinations. people eat up, teachers included. One said they'd sue families mask mandates. insane. guy replied source remembered even vaccine, likely may partially effective.

They're saying prevent infections, it'll lessen symptoms. test currently infected, 'has infected'. Gross.

I'd love job tbh, I'm bored mind, things getting worse. Really hoping Biden wins comes sweeping functionality get us back normal first.  Meanwhile, grandma get tested doctor's appointment. told self-isolate week day test day appointment. got paid time job.

Ah yes, Reddit, pro-Trump sentiment mods remove anything left-leaning.

the actual fuck. know lot SARS? I'm wondering SARS sorta disappeared years (and MERS too), wondering social distancing + decent vaccine help push SARS2 enough sorta disappear part like two coronaviruses That's lot deaths low case count. think asking severely underestimates human free part human nature told “no” forces us want something more. Annnnnnd I’m sure vast majority people tired it. Minor inconvenience not, people tired. Step 1: young population 
Step 2: virus can’t kill anyone old people kill top mine.  Hold horses, lockdown declared last Friday, results seen 10 days now, minimum. we'll dealing Covid till climate change kills us. cutoff's late March pandemic's 1 year anniversary. Afterwards, idk I'll do. Considering believe America liberty important safety. would argue protests systemic racism little important political candidate's rally. That's judgment call though. One I'm willing stand behind, subjective. agree, absolutely reason I've posted don’t realize gradual harm virus economy potential cripple economy worse shutdown.. non-Dooms Day talk.. drink all. wear watch sleeping actually might. don’t think locking entire nation protect 90 year olds dementia would picked flu fair trade off. 

Why don’t compare Holland Belgium? moan population density look data swedes actually live.  1 fatality migrant dorms 50000 cases. would say general attitude everyone annoyed/fatigued social distancing majority people follow done around them. Go Costco, strict masks everyone wearing mask. Go road restaurant according mask mandate allowed take mask table place packed people wearing masks.


As long bars restaurants open going social pressure go out, really possible bar restaurant safely. pandemic when, infected, worse happen people, get cold like symptoms? get back something thats 65% normal happens. idea we're gonna wait flu vaccine effectiveness insane. unexpected all. Tegnell supporters' sudden change tune happened.

""We've always war Eastasia"", tell us. course, that's saying months 'I think main difference Sweden many countries **we kind restrictions recommendations place whole time**.  really big adherence population recommendations.  'And makes difference, makes us hopefully less susceptible second wave.' positivity rate Monday Monday? death serious illness significantly reduced, infection rate largely irrelevant.  reddit supports socialism lol could give hours host/bus staff, would take couple people minutes spray/wipe whole thing.

And would help stop covid flare ups, put bit trust domes, maybe It’s stupid don’t even know process it. Open stupidity either. biggest risk death, oversaturating country's medical infrastructure people REALLY need medical attention (e.g., heartattacks, car accidents, etc ) get medical attention need without wait 6 hours waiting rooms bunch dumb fucks decided party crowding hospital.

Do world favor kids. people share selfish, egotistical train thought problem US today.

Fuck you. death serious illness significantly reduced, infection rate largely irrelevant. Source? Right, except ignoring major difference centrepoint entire discussion.

That *still* better position U.S. pressed advantage U.S. not. Lol I'm getting downvoted similar views get ready. Sorry know New Zealand isnt exactly us I'm saying us could get basically 0 cases like retarded think ""there's nothing could done New Zealand closed borders hurr durr"" shits dumb man definitely remember saying masks useless. 

Again, I'm masks. makes common sense could prevent spread blocking droplets mouths. think mandatory. people want wear should.

In fact, randomized controlled trial (the gold standard studies) date, conducted regards cloth masks, medical masks viral spread actually found 97% particles penetrated cloth masks 44% penetrated medical masks. study actually cautioned wearing cloth masks due fact could increase spread, particularly health service workers. 

If wash cloth mask properly, daily
Or touch mask wearing it
Or wear chin
Or wear mouth
there point wearing mask

So think masks mandatory. think healthy living much important simply relying mask think you’re months late. current sentiment here.   trolls say thought safe kids go back school? /s want know well US Canada could done, look Korea, Thailand, places followed US CDC guidelines pandemics playbook. that... well, let idiots drive 4 years somehow dismantled everything would helped. smh.


First, wrong. Second, people socializing. socializing RIGHT NOW.


Such weak minded people... discussion posts nice positivity, away “distance 2022!” “No immunity” “Stupid Americans!” posts. Okay, wouldn’t elderly person vaccinated?
If it’s logistical thing quickly get production line wouldn’t factor anyway would busy vaccinating grandmas? 

If logistically could would impossible vaccinate risk population?
Or rates 98% whatever. (We smallpox)
I’m going pretend I’m expert vaccines know flu vaccine isn’t 100% *but* covid one meant give complete coverage? 

Thanks taking time actually talk me. 
I think vaccines amazing gift humanity I’m
Just dubious one *may* rushed disease less chance flu killing me. January going hell. 

A lot parties Halloween spread November.

Then people visiting families Thanksgiving spread December.

Then people Christmas New Years. 

If months go without serious efforts taken, going shitshow January. yet countries really created innovative products life changing. US dominant created one best products: social media (ig/facebook/snapchat huge whether hate not), iphones, excel, amazon prime, netflix..All changed life...can't think much countries done compared products..Because innovative products, think US ahead while.  Hence obsess reality TV surgeon general got trouble going Hawaii. Eye roll. ***failure adhere self isolation cost capitalism Yeah, like brings surveillance chips e.g. smh. brother well. Luckily tested negative, work long time due covid take time contact positive person (who worked really shut things down) job long either. matter did. thing matters many didn't.

It's infuriating everything right others messed rest. trying basically call stupid tell wrong, trying give another perspective viewed. keep mind see reasons sides, lean way.

Most hate chinese government people living there. actually allowing virus happen first place, like said could happen lots places variety circumstances. delay getting information people find it. started appearing China year ago, maybe earlier. barely mentioned least month later doctors people trying get information, people persecuted trying get information disadvantageous China. 

So, part, people mad chinese leaders even feel sorry chinese people major reason zero problem virus spreading outside province decided get things control Wuhan. chinese government genuinely barricaded suspected, confirmed, cases homes. even welded doors shut prevent people leaving. Effective, yes, inhumane. People America get jail charges treating animals less cruelty well deserved.

The problem entirely 'exotic' meats, though part problem. unsanitary conditions animals living kept close allowed happen. Animals kept unsanitary conditions like caused get sick other, eventually virus mutates enough comes contact human hundreds thousands times, one going mutate way actually allows infect humans. least understanding I've read.

I know whole lot first cases, I'm assuming came bats everything I've heard. I'm sure whether human eating infected meat (under cooked otherwise) general contact animals. Either way, would equivalent US letting cow grow caged small area chickens, pigs, animals living near urinate leave feces. top killing serving piece steak uncleaned within small time frame killing animal cooked rare customer. I'm saying citizen's fault, really kind regulation wet markets also government markets themselves.

Covid really similar salmonella e-coli fact came another source meat infection, mostly difference. E-coli Salmonella basically never contagious, rare occasion rare occurrence. Though appear relatively similar fatality rate looks it, though probably lower. real person typed \^. Like, thought this, formed sentences head, jotted down, submitted it. can. Make concessions. binary.

We need shut society, example. need shut bars, restaurants, nightclubs. need mandate masks. need something school.

If nations things, stuck them, we'd problem largely solved.

It's damned stupid. Whoops, virus came back! understand people understand this. average probability works level population, individual, never know one individual falls risk spectrum. everyone needs pay attention. feds cracked hard banks afraid make loans. people legit deserved money get summer. bad actors go jail, millions people got paychecks working. doctors charge economics money factor cost / benefit analysis. job tell people best way get sick. understand impact global economic shutdown.

This also advocate extreme measures even illness health related issues arise like SARs mad cow disease. something that's easy people privileges say, harder real people live, particularly economic social support insecurities.

Also, lockdowns based flawed understanding collateral impacts coronavirus, incorrect premise virus gets bored goes away people make sacrifices fixed period time returning normal. fact humanity ever successfully eradicated one virus, would smallpox, almost measles eradicated US fucking antivaxxers ruin shit. average person might say, oh wore mask don’t know caught it!? Eyes, poor hygiene, enough hand sanitizer, trusted someone claimed 100%. There’s sorts reasons could wear mask still catch it. 

Soap water touching anything, sanitizer tissue door handles, avoid fast food joints, etc. know sometimes simply isn’t possible do, might even forget. takes one mistake! definitely planning, unrelated current pandemic sign, unfortunately, no, Americans better this. I’m telling you, Dems we’re ready largest stimulus package history nation last one ran out. tried cutting multiple times reach agreement. earth gives idea sides “working together” anything? Republicans blocked everything last... 12 years so. Dems aren’t perfect isn’t sides thing right all. lol that's even close true. also probably distinction severe cases mild cases - people get small initial exposure nose mouth, able fight spreads get mild cases. People inhale large doses deep lungs likely get severe cases. also explains ""imperfect"" masks seem fairly large impact spread - simply adding baffles front airway lowers velocity incoming breaths, makes likely virus get caught nose mouth rather express ride lungs. true. People making argument destroying economy lockdowns, yet realize lockdowns would decimate economy number people would die unable work due covid. ok folks say assumption give 100% effort respectful mask socially distance others out. Problem usually someone wanting asshole. BioNTech 1 ug 10ug dose “high” antibody response participants scratched table entered phase II participants. reason? Didnt last long. shit. point we've one November pandemic now. think hell hole? cite paper Fauci? social conformity goes beyond mask wearing. oops, that's right, child sick, im going use paper towel open door. Also, think takes many non-conformers cause spread. Imagine grocery store customers mostly stay home sick, occasionally shop wash hands frequently, wear masks etc. Add one person equation sick coughing without mask store. Add ten. makes huge difference. **kind** restrictions recommendations place whole time. 

And still do. They're drastically different. sure get re-infected remained asymptomatic? think know that. even suggested viable alternative paint scenario every country world resources ”heavy contact tracing” work home half year.

Before C19 fiasco te US, world managed infectious diseases like Ebola SARS1 source. different. First get rid lands help can't get rid even if, divine intervention, got worldwide cases 0, virus could jump animal again, we’re back.

That's problem long contact tracing. soon detected contacts traced animal best-case scenario, world would need maintain aggressive contact tracing local lockdowns very, long time, making pandemic never-ending.

I would say forever great thing. Pandemics natural occurrence postpone attacks nature throw us.

We 21st-century society. need manage diseases nature tries throw us. good time start.

Given cost epidemics, international super-team contact tracers infectious disease rapid response makes sense world.  You’ve got car crash survived; you’re dead one treat hospital. 

You’ve got heart attack; you’re dead even made hospital they’re full covid patients. 

You’ve got stroke survived; doctors treat they’re still treating covid patients. 

A lot preventable injuries diseasess become fatal hospital system collapsed. said - government incompetent dealing crisis. ill equipped. Washington good distributing money. distributing rapid testing, PPE, contact tracing, mobilizing shutting hotspots - things need deal pandemic - government sucks at. add science-denying, we've turned corner, Trump factor, economic disaster looming. economy toilet COVID managed, freedoms freedoms. saw month ago, girl know went out-of-state bachelorette party. So, ten women various areas country, getting together one idiotic tacky rituals existence, traveling back partners kids. 

Imagine risking health others could spend weekend drinking Pinot Grigio penis straw taking drunken selfies. Priorities...

(ETA shouldn’t say “girl,” I’m referring 40 y/o. Old enough know better, waaaay old acting fool.) agreed Belgium poorly, still can't compare even single metropolitan area US. Belgium one interconnected countries Europe. stone-throw away Amsterdam, Cologne, PARIS, LONDON, hosts central EU government, well older population US metropolitan area. ""it affect young people"". Tell kid's parents. big question yes article proof it. lies masks, acknowledge Taiwan, wants use lockdowns form punishment? Yeah baby!!! gonna great. Huge companies gonna real estate market, quality everything gonna go down...

But hey, least decade we'll cybernetics we'll able brawl ultramilitarized police, right?!

...For real though, Deus Ex, Cyberpunk, Blade Runner... literally coming together, frankly, even worse. 30 million doses available end January. I'd say majority reddit, young, overweight worrying. holy epidemiologists, must never questioned f'ing around numbers computer day Scientific Consensus (trademark) already predicted 1000 daily deaths start November. 182 today. Plus, look solidarity vast minority. Unless vast minority becomes majority, solidarity buys long-term hardship. Imagine government worked benefit American People vs class elite &amp; wall-street?

In March European countries drafting policy pause mortgages/rents also offering direct assistance citizens.. debating whether mask work Covid hoax.

Let’s clean trash.. vote everyone out.  wonder much better results we'd getting government said positive COVID result means:

* £400 bank

* Work allow take 14 days off, fully paid. 

* £10,000 fine leave house. I'm from, government offered total freeze mortgages protections renters. Organising rent strike perfectly legitimate exercise.

Perhaps landlord can't function without rent, get real job. Oh well remember reading 95+% chance something played safe said 90 Glad get look way. get privilege.

And ""You're test negative"" thing. workers helped financially? not, that's another downside. sure, year really shown external forces (social safety net, unity, common goal, social sense duty) affect emotional reserve population.

That’s kicker though, even resolve deal it, know statistically worse longer goes, less people will. sample size millions, can’t blame trend moral failing individual. inevitability society failed (or refused to) plan for.

I hear ya ptsd. Maybe that’s I’m loud topic. year felt *exactly* like past traumas. drawn lower intensity.

At beginning fine. anxiety filled brain go juice. reading every paper, logical science based PPE home sanitization plans, adequately prepared things got bad, etc etc... didn’t let up, systems fried never ending brain fog vague fear

Stay safe stay sane friend I'm living like forever neither everyone else you. miss bowling league, miss eating out, miss going indoor sporting events, etc. Maybe ok never seeing another human 99.9% people not. virtual socializing cut it. People need go fun release whatever problem have. Suicides spiked people getting depressed living like this. age really effect low infection rates/positive rates? seems like something must happened allow virus enter population much.

Probably best learn keep population uninfected. Age helps severity, think. Uh what?

If tested positive Singapore Vietnam forced mandatory quarantine upon you. Supervised quarantine top that. is! Dear Leader said? Note reinfections get confirmed. confirmed reinfection virus sequenced times confirm two different strains (not relapse infection). people get tested get sequenced.

Now, big question is: ... likely present within adults six months primary infection

How many most? 70% 80%? 90%? [64.4% vs 36.6% Rent Home 1/3 population would homeless eviction credit report make much harder rent COVID over. Id imagine, mechanics almost necessitate weight loss reduction intake hard breakdown sugars, make actually good you. though  long breathlessness think stupidity. people finding meaning community actively caring. administration's strategy since May care, surrogates done good job propagating messaging around that. Kushner? you? No, purpose government US historical beliefs standards. White House leadership seen weddings kids football practice quarantine.

There multiple things play here. 2 major ones economic cost poor people cant afford people give fuck anyone themselves. country divided emotionally invested division.

Says someone says bunch divisive drivel. fairness, address post title, people convinced stopped? 

Aside obvious point virus (with possible exception smallpox) ever totally eradicated, still people feel 8 months US, lock harder, close schools, close businesses, enforce mask wearing harder, go away? 

hint: won't. US simply big many independent people. It’s definitely mixed bag. Restaurant Manager large corporation TN. take every precaution listed CDC. around someone COVID? You’re negative covid test. Eh we're close enough. masks POE, distancing, cleaning keeping hands clean help prevent infection.

And yet people European countries hit hard right insist they're things. Dr. Fauci explicitly said online article interviews. called rent strike, often work pretty well. They're easy organise, however.  kind bounce around Springfield, st Charles, lake ozarks.
I born raised st Charles county, moved Springfield school, graduated fiancé still school stay time. go st Charles stay family least month.
So basically, live two counties getting worst Covid numbers lol
Im 23 immunocompromised due chronic illness recent surgery.
I’m mostly concerned 97 year old grandma lives St. Peter’s go much longer whole population snaps. data states least 12 months immunity covid, know really still new virus. Pandemics, like many disasters, uniform beasts.

This article points 100,000 Americans died. adjust population that’s roughly 200,000 deaths today’s population terms.

Over course whole disease.

Here 236,000 official deaths, unofficial. disease isn’t even close done yet. Cases keep going up.

We’ve seen chaos disease bring healthcare system grows unchecked. absolute disaster. averted worst *so far*.

It’s inappropriate hold post-mortem disease that’s getting started, comparisons 1957 valid, extent learn mistakes. extent pretend today 1957.

This disease *lot* show us, point looks like savior vaccine. Apathy means get see full horror show.

I don’t ultimately like “go face danger” message *without* clear indication responsibly. say “go face danger” doctor wearing right equipment makes sense. “Go face danger” someone partying without mask underground club different matter. I'm one people take daily low dose aspirin doctor tells (my blood clots much).

Don't take daily aspirin without making sure doctor okay it. good lot ways. vaccine highly effective (and highly effective, mean early 90s range, least), providing strong, long lasting immunity, *could* eliminate virus globally, impractical, wishful thinking. best, tame minimal levels.

That said, would pleasantly surprised somehow managed successfully extinguish coronavirus SARS, highly unlikely.  People keep trying present evidence X = result fact one really seems handle causes what, yet. becomes really irritating want discuss anomalies rational way, shut dare question we're doing. “hoax”. That's sound inevitability Mr. Anderson. Yes source common sense. know facts everyone holds self evident. Except idiots. Wow people r/coronavirus finally discovering hardships negative repercussions advocating global economic shutdown 6+ months? crazy. thought allowed fear-monger around here. Error due assuming false dichotomy. predominant systemic problems, form effective Workers' Union and/or ensure government cares public health. Well, lawyer (albeit constitutional lawyer, go one top law schools country taught one top schoalrs country) history country basically story human struggle freedom, equality, security pursuit happiness, that, finding reasons break Constitutional norms exceptional circumstances call better judgment calls it. 

Remember, slavery, gender inequities racism also basically built constitution. shouldn’t let constitution prevent us right thing. founders would surely agree that. That’s major point try drive across constitutional issues arise.

And no, Korematsu (the case regarding Japanese internment) little immigration. security. nothing like imprisoning 120,000 without due process law, one major fundamental rights hold dear, violate constitutional rights people name security. “liberty” interest vs “security” interest major concept constitutional law. Security often wins.

Dont mean debate history constitutional law except say, ever moment challenge certain constitutional norms ensure look like South Korea, Taiwan, Australia New Zealand terms coronavirus deaths current US Brazil, it. Nothing says security saving quarter million American lives, saving economy. virus rest world struggled it, bet ass economy would much better.

(Also, immigration used federal power. mostly done states. biggest intrusion state rights issue first major federal immigration law Chinese Exclusion Act several decades earlier 1882, angle never taught American school system mostly focus black vs white issues) key point ""self-isolation"". can't expect selfish Europeans (let alone Americans) think beyond &amp; immediate family. They're simply going quarantine unless they're forced to. Governments would strap ankle monitors issue huge fines, like house arrest, prevent public venturing out. started new job &amp; company policy can't even use PTO first 90 days. get Covid I'm screwed. going going least another year. ""Herd mentality"" happen make shorter. people vote right way, we'll another administration place January hopefully take immediate steps.

I'm sure people understand completely disorganized current administration is. flailing around anything, anything place anything even wanted (which dont want to). Yes late lot stuff since last December, still stuff still stuff. hold tight. can’t follow orders solder door shut inside send rations semi consistent schedule  know bothering comment seeing original comment referring someone tip. Yes, are. Millions. God country fucking stupid. truly boggles mind point. CDC reliable highly regarded source this? fact give pause. mean self isolation people contacted coronavirus. lockdowns stopgap tracing could established. that, sort federal benefits pay leave people test positive come contact tested positive. plan gets vaccine first FYI IDPH website. Opened schools soon; people still want believe schools drivers pandemic, everywhere opened schools virus spread rapidly throughout entire state/country rapidly.

California mostly control right Governor ordered keep schools virtual. Eradication repiratory virus possible take years was. Plus, goal flattening curve? assumes movements equally distributed throughout country. move throughout whole country generally? pandemic government advises travel? point, number contact tracers fixed countries. would far public health workers France NZ, example. Also, contact tracing usually handled local level. 

The total population size country relevant.  Regularly business, 2018. It’s late. response pandemic already politicized. virus exists every community significant level spreads easily. US, even Biden wins won’t get office January, vaccine hopefully started roll out, much do. admission, doesn’t even sound like institute national mask mandate. sounds like could help fund public health, listen experts, provide funding testing tracing, provide comprehensive federal plan states follow ( won’t work virus already politicized) provide good example leadership American people. 

Unfortunately, best chance semblance control pandemic right beginning. shut strictly transmission driven low level, created robust contact tracing program, instituted mask mandates right away, reopened slowly clear guidelines, reinstated restrictions specific areas flare ups, held vaccine available distributed. 

Instead, nothing paying price. POTUS set tone prioritizing re-opening. old adage pay pay later. chose both. Perhaps partially. vaccine likely reduce hospitalisation rate, allowing us tolerate daily infections, we'll still need tread carefully. read UBI meant enough replace working subsidize it. 

I don’t think would help someone much unemployment does, especially decently paying job. 

Though also admit don’t know lot UBI either quick google.  pandemic sure makes great case UBI it? wonder primary would turned happened year ago. Would laughed Yang stage? Fake news! can't say that. shown obesity plays role, someone dies, supposed say that. someone chews 3 tins tobacco day, develops mouth cancer dies, supposed mention tobacco might anything outcome. person suffering anorexia dies systems literally starved, ever mention lack eating anything it. must something else. probably people China NZ believe COVID. SK huge alt-right rally right-wing propagandists basically believe COVID government psy-op. guess what? government toss hands say, ""Oh, there's bunch crazies there, even bother? They'll ruin everything, might well stop fighting COVID!""

To me, that's complaints sound like. effective government, dissenters want, better worse, matter. US effective government. numbers aren’t bad rate hospitalization certainly higher common cold pretty much age ranges. Damn people literally anything talk kids. Eh, counter would SARS MERS, viruses virus similar to. appear give longer immunity. guy encouraged people go eat Chinatown pandemic first never made claims referring to. 
I said happening.
And is.. Thats bit nonsensical use word ""triage"". Triage done healthcare time, hospitals full. think latest stimulus failure sign less liberal vs. conservative, failure strictly-partisan political system. Neither side willing budge other, *nobody* one. Partisan politics good pandemic, need working together most. government failed us caught loyal whichever ""side"" on.

Edit: guys I'm trying argue, genuinely wanted discuss take :( Oh I'm sorry, dont understand feel bad  Covid-19 Solemnity Saints?

From Litany Saints:

Omnes Sancti et Sanctæ Dei. Orate pro nobis.

All Holy men women God. Pray us.

Or pre-Vatican II text:

Omnes Sancti et Sanctæ Dei. Intercedite pro nobis.

All Holy men women God. Intercede us.

And today Souls Day:

Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine. Et lux perpetua luceat ei. Requiescat pace.

Eternal rest grant unto them, oh Lord. let perpetual light shine upon them. May rest peace.

If can’t make connection pandemic two solemnities *celebrating praying faithful dead*, please let know I’ll best clearer much charity muster. you’re qualified program, Edd run out, supposedly they’re planning extend 3 5 months first another 3 5 months. forget one comes first total extension 8 months. don’t know qualifies I’m assuming you’ve getting Edd you’re likely qualified. That’s I’ve read, regarding plan Edd runs out. easiest soultion would let corona run wild. right expand that, they're actually making harder keep social distance forcing everyone home time. Oh wow, idea existed! Thank you. :)  worried happens medical community gets sick care control covid patients. girlfriend received positive rapid test 3-4 hours with/kissed her. We're young 20's immunocompromised decent symptoms still feel fine. live houses 5-6 housemates know quarantine I've already exposed isolate there's chance 1 us bad 2. spirits high would love hear thoughts! nurse - want support gratitude, want hazard pay, want put mask go see friends relatives, physical distancing. People's mental health can't survive isolated winter, get that, I'm asking stop enjoyable riskier things, want basic precautions them. stay, can't wish away virus

Like flu nobody cares about. Sounds like it’s Covid. í long **e**....

As *see*. Ftfy  oui, ça craint normal PCR tests seem quite accurate swab done incorrectly wrong point time, may fail. 100 % specific, false positives.

I've yet see Covid rapid test datasheet, I've seen influenza datasheet claiming 90-95 % specific sensitive, meaning result may wrong 5 - 10 %. I'm confident Corona test would used similar high number false positives. thought mildly amusing show-me state joke. guess nobody agreed :( Maybe needed sunglasses.  Americans posting kid deserved die fat, even fatter poor kid Maybe people can't afford miss day work what's alternative keep kids school vaccine comes? mean bad economic standpoint also mental health perspective well generally well kids. School important kids keep school mental health suffer quite alot early age due isolated friends also hinders education chance success life. especially comes kids poorer families risk falling far behind wealthier kids. risk creating lost generation school kids. young kids near end high school getting ready approach university soon.

That's reason many countries Europe going lockdown like England, Germany France still keeping schools open. Rather everything keep schools open aslong possible. employer ordering employees, everyone. Definitely insane, it’s like top order, said zoom calls, again, insane, requiring wear times. US weeks behind Europe. Something latitude, doubt. understand this. try shopping 1am *specifically* far fewer people store. pushing window increase density people hours? fuck gives shit phase 1 trials point conservative, aren’t stupid. anyone elaborate belgium failed hard contain disease? people wear mask, self isolating testing/contact tracing enough Good move, Boris, wake growing skeptic movement England could undermine strength policy. Hopefully lockdown done *right* time. means believe pandemic over, since referring previous event. Yeah moreso Media call pandemic fatigue fact society self isolate 2 years. get tired precisly pandemic, fact clear ending (and not). 
Instead people telling see family, couple friends, start saying hang relative security, everything outdoors facemask everytime can, ventilation indoor, avoid crowed spaces limit number close contact meet.
This flu also measless, necessary become hermit.
(I discuss ""you make zoom friends"") scare ravaged lungs

He long term side effects life. point game watch people horror die needlessly preventable disease. saying someone Madison WI listen equally someone Wuhan China says much governor New York saying daily? Unless U.S.; realize STILL one country? Late night partying maybe? People tend drink go bars evening may lead less careful. really sure though, least something Honestly. force thousands families jobs era massive unemployment, financial assistance, expect okay think responsible policy. Also, start producing months advance. That's one reasons vaccines always work well - guess main strains ahead time. think anyone advocating 'constant lockdown'

No we're situation people saying need lockdowns others saying need less, they're saying government making mess it. need spikes required 'lockdown' type throughout lifecycle virus, spread across different communities response fair virus. city sees spike stricter rules regulations businesses open, capacities, distances etc. businesses requiring facial coverings such. 

That's exactly we've UK tier systems. like kid covered paint running around house kid keeps yelling can't stifle freedom one parent saying ""nah, he's going get everything kids going going mess, needs go bathroom get clean"" parent saying ""Screw it, need house, many kids anyway.""

You're talking two extremes opposite sides. I'm arguing sentiment. I'm saying neither parents considered parents they're handling perfectly. parents need come decision going work keep bills paid trying utmost stop spread paint. Neither parent correct neither parent say wrong. know, bad around kids. kids, literally flu deadly. I'm bait posting. article headline super super rare kids die, kids die almost always extremely unhealthy.  10 days last test It’ll interesting see future medicine diagnosing illness quantum computing becomes prominent! Aren’t like 15 worked on? city local church. Started 18 known cases. 150 connected church. Oh, far 40 local deck hockey league. city running free Covid test site tomorrow. UC street PACKED  think providing direct stimulus disastrous 6 months. commercial real estate collapse alone, paired loss income livelihood millions something reverse. Partisanship needs put aside save country.  way ever going work money people actually stay home. happen. 

People could stayed home without lockdown. Even still go work school never forced pack bars restaurants. Nobody forced WI wear masks attend parties. lockdown everyone paid stay home *should* happened (and probably still should) ultimately people WI blame. Right, US large varied, states reporting 30%-50% positive rates according happened France, caseload spiked week later. thing happened southern US states summer less OK. time tell way state go time around. imagine others well. grocery store customers mostly stay home sick, occasionally shop wash hands frequently, wear masks etc.

I really know about, described grocery stores almost nationwide. People surprisingly unaware spreads virus, new them. MERS SARS always far-from-our-bed show never prepared way. It’s like certain countries Asia grow learn young age. amount people called asked contact with, first answer ‘nobody’ 30 minutes wrote 20+ people crazy. It’s like Secret Eaters, really don’t notice it’s learned behavior work pandemic.

And mention big amount people cannot isolate. It’s unfair blame trying best. learned group large. think individuals responsible, read article. That's problem West, everything individual. whole bootstrap mentality, may work well normal times (of course doesn't!) middle national crisis. Democratic Asian countries successful tackling COVID working government invested public health measures. What's US government invested in? Keeping illegals cutting healthcare? can't even right!

And anyone says anything Oceania, really think people Melbourne would stayed locked 3 months voluntarily without kind government welfare? Give break. Americans thinking personal responsibility 4 years ago went vote someone reality TV host. so... still waiting critical thinkers explain SK Taiwan beat virus Roommate started pain throat Saturday night.

He PCR test done yesterday (nasal) found yesterday negative.

He still pain throat gets urge cough little (just clears throat) often nose feels congested times. also mucous throat.

Should isolate ? nurse practitioner told doesn’t to.   I’m happy hear that. Would painful y’all didn’t.

Here Texas, non essential businesses shut employees lost jobs got 1 relief check $1200, majority independent small businesses went business, unemployment monetary aid EXTREMELY difficult get. friends made claims back April still haven’t seen single coin aid.  know immune system works right? get sick, body becomes immune disease long mutate. exposed diseases get sick them. regard Tegnell cause large number deaths, asking. ultimate incivility. ""rounding corner."" hear tomorrow, magically disappear.

/s explain South Korea Taiwan able control shit immediately. delhi 3rd wave highest cases far


In rest country 7 day average also reversed past 2 days. What’s death rate people younger 75? Less 1%? Pretty sure that’s par common cold. Absolutely.  know stop virus - stop people different households getting close contact other.

And would say, no. would need enact government police level make solution happen would way worse future anything coronavirus would us. 

Coronavirus, despite sub, problem world, existential threat human race, unlike constant growth surveillance state police apparatus is. honestly think scientists entirely understand fomite transmission either, least seem I've read. read interesting article regarding fomite transmission (just general, specific COVID) possibly airborne vector. done guinea pigs, found pathogen question settled bedding, simply act moving around caused become airborne riding dust/dander/bedding particles capable infecting guinea pigs fairly far via inhalation.

No idea COVID spread fashion can't see relevant groceries, make realize might making many assumptions safe regards COVID. instance; drive car infected person previously drove, aired drove disinfected steering wheel, could still danger due fomites stirred seat fabric might breathe in, instance? tin foil hat. dumb, virus, jack ripper. Another anecdotal response here...

I antibodies infected early March. either test wrong, antibodies lasted long time reinfected point without knowing got antibodies. New restrictions imposed MA. haven’t seen science understanding mask doesn’t really protect wearer, wearer sick reduce ability infect others. cough whatever doesn’t blow across whole room.

So initially organizations discouraging mask use offers false sense security bad habits. (Social distancing/hand washing still king protecting yourself). seem recommend wearing basic facial coverings reduce community transmission, even WHO. 

I don’t know there’s even evidence mask usage reducing community transmission.  hospital n95 masks proper technique? Sure. grocery store people wearing plastic face shields, cloth rags dust masks local government requires mask kind? doubt much. 

I would surprised find years people time sit back analyze various responses Covid isn’t evidence mask mandates made difference rate spread. like saying getting car accidents getting shot big deal you’re likely survive No? hasn’t reported case SARS since 2004. Yup, get ready America. :( Talk federal govt Agree vaccine enough protect elderly vulnerable fatal symptoms, Yeah feel genuine people. like blue badges, I've known people harassed parking disabled spots looking disabled enough. Awful  worst part terrible shortsightedness many healthcare providers (not U.S.) run nurses ragged begin with.

Then, something like comes along puts extra strain system already tension, bound collapses.

And worst is, nurses job really care people want help.

I'll job next lockdown. got fucked people refused take even basic precautions.

We share planet air, downside one us walk around, spraying deadly virus shared air.

That’s it’s important us unite shared problems, like pandemics. leaders failed you. People hanging friends family huge cause spread well. Well, fair really depends country question. mostly referencing United States. Unpopular opinion: stop eating dead animals. shit getting fixed. live like seasonal flu. 

Giving money businesses allows keep paying employees, Even shut down, keep paying rent means landlords don’t go bankrupt. :( bottom heart: fuck you. 1000% Facebook. chance hell monitored hard LE policing themselves. Asia does. Wear mask feeling sick, season disease. Theyre allowed approach me. set food down, knock, stand road see take it.

Plus actually pay decent wages start. Freedom's adults. Tell 6yo freedom cuss hear profanity. Hand 6yo gun tell right arms, someone gets shot. unfortunate apparently bunch children counts. Nope. expect millions deaths US leading way. Western culture doesn’t value life unless it’s womb. going get “validity study” outside perspective makes sense. Reports says it’s blood clotting issue virus aspirin directly fights that. Available everyone vaccinated? know vaccine available turned switch instacure without first inoculating everyone measuring effectiveness. sub answers question. downvotes. 

And even vaccine, likely may partially effective. Covihallowen already happened sense. 

I cleaning Friday afternoon put hand table. Felt something sharp arm pulled back, thinking nothing it. assumed scraped staple something wood. 

Went day. 

About 8 hours later notice spot knicked turning really red, washed soap went day.  Faster forward Saturday wake arm itching ferociously. redness worse, arm slightly sore swollen. I’m breaking hives shoulder hand. call dr prescribes antibiotic l. take day call next day hives accompanied look like random blisters along arm. go ER, wait time immense. look prescribe antibiotics sent home saying didn’t available observation beds requesting non-critical patients self observe. 

It’s Monday honestly think damn arm fall soon something. idea happened it, every Dr I’ve seen rushed workloads look longer seconds. mean reacted way late, measures weren’t strict enough Disaster aided terrible politicians.  quarantine you’re evicted place isolated? Try reading article next time English por favor I'm calling idiot ask questions see truly thinking critically don’t feel need genuinely

The vaccine necessarily prevent getting it. protects vulnerable people could easily completely unknowingly spread to. ok accidentally infecting possibly hospitalizing someone worried something extremely rare?

Do consider riding cars worth risk? Damage done either way. There’s magic way this. Hopefully don’t another pandemic soon... Nobody likes can't whine away virus ""over it"" like sub seems trying do. widespread community transmission, masks aren’t super effective since lot transmission houses (where people don’t wear masks). 

It effective curtailing community outbreaks. enough supply, anything would need worry enough people taking due vaccine skepticism, laziness, etc. exactly I'm saying always mystery EU seeing surge compared India saw decline cases removing lockdown. Yeah man, friends think envisioning vaccine day gonna like V-J Day something, bells ring everyone runs street drink, dance make other. keep trying temper view saying going long walk back, going vary nation state, probably even region, masks/distancing/etc. going lifted different rates different places restrictions imposed. I'm NY, I'm expecting say rural areas Upstate back pre-pandemic normal way sooner Brooklyn Queens. Much fewer people vaccinate etc. path back/easing restrictions LA NYC lot different what's needed rural Nebraska. Etc. shit. leaders actually lead us, made easy stay isolated, get proper testing, wouldn’t big deal. Yeah, contact tracing simply feasible past certain point, necessitating lockdown. Plenty countries also entered short lockdown early prevent reaching point reopened months without issue.

A decisive lockdown bad followed proper measures. that's correct remember study done United States Northeast mutation would affected people wearing masks. ""If scared stay home""

I would like personally punch person hear say this. think people understand this, said route getting ""means little"" via drastic changes new leadership adhering science + widespread vaccination. People downvoted saying things ""means little"" true.

The end goal hope see pandemic downgraded decreases infections achieved though two things (strong leadership widespread vaccination.) pandemic drastically changed city (NY) nearly flattened curve less four months infections drastically reduced via strong leadership adhering science...and that's even taking consideration plans anticipated vaccine roll 2021. two things combined mean much ""little"" - means LOT. SARS short term scare almost 20 years ago materialize significant threat people. anything, SARS comparisons early would sent message would blow quickly. I’m corned mandate take premature vaccine. Even it’s safe take virus already mutated new strain means got rush shorten year gap. That's everyone wears them... know point is.... hear point herd immunity maybe backfiring big time. However, also valid arguments continuing lockdowns could backfire big time. done needs shared regional coalition Germans always think that. :) think cabin crew does. passenger wearing gas mask suffer Yeah, day. 3 days far.

But worries decrease call ""this cannot happen without God intervention creative accountability"".

 went 24K 12K 3 days.

Hope true. hope Europe.

But quite unbelievable :S. China's borders closed. Typical crusty Bristol kids exact opinion joe rogan covid shamed media last months, people need work earn money there’s support government. 90% people, losing home able buy essentials worse 2 week effects virus China draconian lockdown Wuhan. Also, definitely cannot trust numbers. economy crashed like everyone else's. Worse better others. 

But right, source compares places outperformed sound great. Compared neighbours tho, economy declined line (and highest unemployment Nordic nations) nothing November. wasn’t Chinese New Year Chinese government admitted problem.

Canada less USA didn’t want look racist never closed international travel summer. I'm Hong Kong almost cases, government really top track trace game, every potential case quarantined.

Our restaurants open, bars open, streets busy, we've never lockdown.

The fact west copy obviously successful system making wonder they're copying purpose. Like end goal they're can't figure out. makes sense continue stupid shit over. Americans romanticize Canada pretty crazy conservatives own. ""But MIT lab collected 70,000 audio samples containing number coughs.

Of those, 2,500 people confirmed cases coronavirus.""

Robust. given emergency use authorizations tests WAY less data accuracy. might even able sent remotely phone recordings.

I'm in. Eradication would saved lives, helped economy long term. number half assed shut downs sure make one big one seem logical. 

Who knew?? 


// Everyone brain. 

Those looking report notice state put 2,709 today new cases added 1706 yesterday's numbers says 6,526 instead 4,820. screw new cases positivity lot add 2,709 + 39,169 =41,878 2,709 / 41,878 =6.47% Calculation version similar different positive numbers 4,651 + 39,169 = 43,820 4,651 / 43,820 =10.61%.

And retest positive ( 3,851) lower new case calculations ( 4,651) today. 121% new people tested positive 4,651 3,851. People watch many movies. OOH! Instacure! Take injection everyone miraculously cured instantly, back perfect health! Enough much! take away freedoms betterment society, called laws. 

Are laws bad? beautifully written, thank you.

It's interesting... Asia going much longer, big head start scientific government systems social constructs place maintain. 

I'm sure humans tired this. fight good fight, ever get it? one coming save us. 

We America never even got level flattening first curve.... yet people tired go go again.

It heartbreaking.

I'm tired, PTSD. NYC first wave. course, healthcare workers emergency workers true PTSD see partying inside....they remain vigilant trauma death they've seen.

I’m tired hearing Covid hoax made Democrats. Democrats South Korea, fucking idiots. travel bans don’t work doesn’t China open borders? think we’re stupid? 109 bands! That's really great. miss concerts well. Yeah, that's exactly antivaxer sentiment. obviously entitled him, insistent calling is? Hate say it, I'm kind getting point. mean could taken lesson china, italy, france, spain, uk, ny, texas, florida, texas again, or..... can't seem figure out. point halfta accept society going get it. matter say do, people going get it. Maybe deserve get. :( Symptoms taken account.

What I'm saying would be, everyone would report symptoms, people without symptoms get tested. Likely happen, wouldn’t optimistic vaccine. compare world population Spanish flu now, it’s big difference.

Yes think normalcy return slowly things all. pick one thing say “when X back normal” that’s easier talking everything once. International travel back pre pandemic levels restrictions could long.

What mean “out May”? I’m well aware hivemind sub thinks, never realistic chance eradicating virus US. 

The virus spreading unchecked unknown major American cities early December 2019 possibly even November. time first wave lockdowns started going around March, already massive numbers infected individuals major population centers, vast majority counted “cases” due lack testing.

Lockdowns slow spread, open up, cases come right back. takes one case slips contact tracing / testing begin exponential spread again. 

There “out this” 1) high-efficacy vaccine available large quantities taken population, 2) enough population infected recovered virus, rate spread slows manageable level. 

If waiting #1, aware highly questionable effective vaccine (50%, 75%, etc.), supplies limited first, may large numbers people simply refuse take it. Exactly I'm happy hear this, truth know sure presents wild. 

We wait there's consensus, think take long.

Just curiosity &amp; boredom last week, made list countries, including countries considered poverty-stricken &amp; politically unstable, looked population checked COVID statistics countries. interested fatality rate due COVID, since everyone seems worried dying (even though recovery rate estimated 97% - 99.75%.)

I really surprised findings.

There three countries COVID deaths 6-digit category:

* United States (330 million population; 227,00 deaths)
* Brazil (210 million, 157,947 deaths)
* India (1.3 billion, 120,000 deaths)

Strange India 3x population US half number deaths.

We're supposed social distance, wear masks, good stuff.

It's awful hard social distance places Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam heavily-populated countries people practically living top other. statistics countries are:

* Hong Kong (7.5 million, 105 deaths)
* Taiwan (24 million, 7 deaths)
* Vietnam (95.5 million, 35 deaths)
* Japan (126 million; 1700 deaths)

**Those low numbers considering overall population.**

**And countries poor &amp; corrupt think due lack decent healthcare, employment, food, transportation, communication, education, etc., everyone countries would dropping like flies. Guess again:**

* Chad (15.5 million, 96 deaths)
* Yemen (28 million, 0 deaths)
* Cameroon (25 million, 426 deaths)
* Somalia (15 million, 104 deaths)
* Sierra Leona (7.6 million, 74 deaths)
* Mozambique (30 million, 91 deaths)
* Haiti (11 million, 232 deaths). Hurricanes killed people Haiti virus.

**Just countries:**

* S. Korea (51 million, 461 deaths)
* Sri Lanka (21 million, 19 deaths)
* Uganda (42 million, 103 deaths)
* Malaysia (31 million, 238 deaths)
* Rwanda (12 million, 35 deaths)
* Cambodia (16 million, 0 deaths)
* Burundi (11 million, 0 deaths)
* Singapore (5.5 million, 28 deaths)

**Some countries 5-digit death rates:**

* Iran (83 million; 33,000 deaths)
* Indonesia (267 million; 13,500 deaths)
* Mexico (129 million; 89,000 deaths)
* Argentina (44 million; 30,000 deaths)
* United Kingdom (66 million; 45, 365 deaths)
* Spain (47 million; 35, 298 deaths)
* France (67 million; 35,270 deaths)
* Russia (146 million; 26,409 deaths)

The point I'm trying make think death rate would higher poverty-stricken countries, not. know hard get accurate count everything, nothing else go except what's posted online. Haiti expected decimated--but been.

There's disparity total numbers country country. places thought would overwhelmed COVID badly all.

I ideas COVID fatalities lower expected countries one reason average population countries age 20-30. that. Age can't determining factor. would United States highest number COVID deaths India, 3x population, 120,000? Vietnam almost 100 million people, 35 deaths. Libya 7 million people, 812 deaths. Nepal population 28 million, 875 recorded deaths.

It's masks social distancing--I'm sure distancing difficult Hong Kong &amp; India; live extremely rural area country, Chad Cameroon, think authorities going find &amp; tell wear mask?

I also think there's difference dying **from** COVID dying **with** virus, doubt CDC authorities make distinction. I'm willing bet passed died virus rather it. read article day man killed motorcycle accident, hospital listed death COVID-related tested positive virus even though displayed symptoms. died accident, virus. Sometimes wonder accuracy info there.

Any theories? You’re reddit. Everyone DR /s I've noticed articles read information recommendations masks anymore. What's go there? give hard? openly stated think they're effective enough helping stop spread Covid?

I ask anti mask friends family constantly referring whatever YouTube vid/news article supports view. I'm looking studies universites earlier year presents data scientific non layman's way easily interpreted time consuming. studies supports mask preventative measure something people taking time read (especially comparison YouTube vid sums everything neat right/wrong package them). 
So actually new studies information reason behind recommending masks anymore? agree Sweden done Denmark Norway, one worst countries world.  awful, incompetent, terrible cruel.

lmao, wtf It’s war fighting , half America stabbing back seems like mostly people barely graduated high school contradicting doctors scientists. really sure trust. What? SARS killed people fast couldnt spread it. Think that. hate poor people able isolate go work  long time since wife pregnant, totally get goes. 

And truly, worry it. course, *anything* possible, best way manage anxiety focus dealing probabilities. probability husband getting COVID-19 outside talking stranger distance sunshine (even person *had* it) extremely low. sad think country category China North Korea citizens take care other.

We absolutely *can* it. Americans *won't* it. government thing, people shittiest sociopaths world. Good us leaders  truly ridiculous. cant say anything positive without getting downvoted. God forbid say want go lockdown there's vaccine. I'm gamer. Staying inside easy aside running outside every adn then. 80% gardening channels eventually talk God Jesus say caused masks? Dude I’m sorry argued many times considering plan vaccinate 80 million people end January can’t give worst case scenario projections one looking incorrect numbers, sure.

The past four Thursdays (picked avoid kind weekend reporting bias, though eyeballing numbers seem exist anyway.)

10/29: 1.9%

10/22: 2.0%

10/15: 1.6%

10/8: 1.5%

10/1: 1.8%

Souce: [NYC COVID Data  correct. Rounding turn....into brick wall. assume numbers Covid back expected number deaths, though. Remember New York City found huge increase deaths? deleted expected number deceased rest counted Covid deaths never even made hospital. 

El Paso going lot at-home deaths. Many people never go hospital fear ICE whether documented not. Texas country. ship fraction people, takes weeks vaccinate millions people, likely require several vaccinations, oxford one require 2 doses begin with. yes take months 2021 protect vulnerable... maybe Trump step process magically make things go 400% faster americans... Pregnant women catch greater risk death severe illness women pregnant, even risk overall remains small, according federal statistics released Monday.

The [data comprehensive U.S. accounting date virus affects pregnant women — shows pregnant women almost three times likely admitted intensive care units, three times likely put ventilator. findings echo [previous pregnancy increased risk severe illness. Yeah. suspect Wuhan government gotten infected brain fog covid beginning Social distancing hard. Wearing mask hard.

Time grow get used changes.

COVID stay, can't wish away virus. UBI, probably. realize covid patients fill ICU beds go critically injured? dying covid. Relevant username. History kind Brexiters. great sustain it. Western Europe socially cohesive rational America still degree rich country self-indulgence. soon gains made business lobby started agitating ""open up"". claimed would disappear, still saying gone. world call right used word ""seasonal"" absolutely used word wrong?

In end people want weddings/concerts/proms/restaraunts/parties/sports/and five day week, person classes see smiling faces. 

So either get vaccine or...we get without (and probably death). people’s desires trajectory.   Thanks input! literally don’t go anywhere besides medical appointments (none scheduled next month 😊) 0 problems staying home. I’m overly cautious general first possible exposure either husband (that know of), anxiety whole new level. Still. Giving attempt US least try Countries greater success would bare minimum lowered amount lives lost losing coming year.

By means perfect can't seem rely another Countries solutions. Turn into? That’s people.  Kim Jong Un 2 talking kids/parents want wear mask. stay home.  Yeah, saying Western culture talking US. Didn’t think needed types articles keep us night raise anxiety levels... guess do. Got link mandate says wear mask house alone? One could also say positivity rate doubled last weeks. live super conservative college town.
Proper mask usage never enforced store work at. care, despite positive cases there.

My coworkers travel state go eat, hang family, go haunted houses, go camping large groups, also parties town. limited socializing. take masks or, best, wear noses.

So yeah, they're essential workers, spread happening primarily social gatherings brought back workplace, imo.

I'm sure varies location. northern Utah absolutely terrible caring people. Well, relevant response would blocked civility filter. fun licking doorknobs friends hope that's exactly read :-D Eradication complete total elimination virus.

I bracing tomorrow Wednesday, people make time go get tested weekend over. theres number studies suggesting Antibody levels decreasing time gives hope longer lasting immunity.

And would even make concession point still wear masks grocery stores them...but that’s it!  logical approach. case, good group good you. people probably didn’t well high school science listening leaders say know better scientists one. Thank you. Good see people using critical thinking. Yeah doesn’t work... could highest number cases yet France IFR 18s insignificant.

Over 50% spread home. teachers family need protected damned scourge. That’s great you, unfortunately threat real majority population put risk public spaces filled people may may “immune.” saying everyone needs stay locked house people parties/restaurants/bars helps one. cold 3 weeks, still little bit. hopefully I'm immune started going back gym opened last week (almost Summer here) Yup, international world borders always bit porous. That's stringent safety measures stamp soon gets here. We've beaten twice already; third time issue either. article mentions policies countries used work needing isolate. Exactly. Blood brain barrier breach reported March microthrombosis. Chinese doctors uploaded videos youtube/twitter told world treat/what etc. infuriating called scientists/doctors ignored effectively caused deaths hundreds thousands people. 

I also heard rumours persistent infection/sequelae early Feb. hope wrong awful even consider.

Listening isnt going get anywhere. would interested seeing credible reports contradict credible reports at-capacity ICU’s. many reports week Utah hospital staffs, example, calling state state find ICU bed availability. Countries well Covid closed borders stayed closed. countries others can't. teacher,

Do access N-95's? wish got 2 weeks.

Over 8 months still suffering shortness breath, tachycardia, overwhelming fatigue, aches, neurological issues, dizziness, memory speech failings, muscle weakness, blurred vision, whatever random bag symptoms body wants throw top that.

I'm convinced pushed breaking point months working grocery store, sick still. 

To clear, contagious months... virus messed body job support got sick. cut hours raised sales expectations apparently making enough money pandemic. grocery workers essential, individuals filling positions not. replace us less day, really care. I'd read article commenting you. microbiologist (although admittedly expertise bacteria viruses) also hopeful things get back normal within year two.

Just getting vaccine everyone probably take year more. also issues people likely refuse vaccine, lead flare-ups. probably still wearing masks year now. Also coronaviruses like mutate, likely need seasonal vaccinations like flu.

That said, cellular immunity news great vaccine trials (mostly) going well. I’m honestly proud awe scientific community whole handled this. Maybe trouble world whole never got things control. like polio smallpox, unless taking seriously everyone go away. takes bad apples spoil bunch - looking US, Brazil, India, bad examples.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vibe getting public is: many people choosing believe vaccine would essentially end pandemic doses distributed. think far reality partly fractured views topic, won’t back anything close normal anytime soon. hope party “Titanic” theme. sounds actually really sensible China bot here. I'll upvote it. US continues blaming others failing introspection better. Keep up.  Someone still using phrase ""global warming"" sort red flag now. There’s bunch misinformation know, didn’t hide certain information public early stages pandemic? true might dumbest one bro see positive trend day numbers high 30th October, might weekend 1st November public holiday Belgium. Weekends public holidays often distort corona statistics. cold weather problem like Europe. Put period dot com it'll jailbreak link could imagine crazy folks trying get positive get 2 weeks work £400... what's plan hospitals completely overwhelmed, health staff sick people can't receive care?

Farage give shit that. He, family donors right matter badly country many people harms policies.

We're talking man made sure children could get German passports suffer removal rights he's inflicting rest us Brexit. 90 year olds (or without) dementia didn’t agree sacrifice economy. job protect protected us upon time.

It way. That's lot deaths low case count. 

From looking Florida numbers past 2 weeks - actually kinda low - around 2-3K cases 100 deaths per day - however death numbers immediately impacted current case numbers (usually lag 4-6 weeks...longer factor many deaths counted months later), Monday, usually death count lower Sunday-Wens Ignorance like forcing millions third world brink starvation, doubt causing countless deaths. 1st world youre ruining everyone's livelihoods causing despair untold scale. bite southwest ass. ""Fears waning?"" fucking death toll racing upwards like one planes hospitals full. Maybe could try putting country passengers first instead profits trying/ difficult time. know anyone comfortable enough travel closed metal tube emergency (several people know forced fly funerals/ deaths family members/ close relatives - moms, dads, etc). Maybe southwest expecting influx emergency travelers meet loved ones sick/ dying? still leave barely surviving. Right?

I.

Can’t.

Wait.

Sadly that’s case least. question becomes, get people testing app like relying getting tested?

If tested result, demographic would tested refuses app says clean. still net gain tested. know two group sizes be. know would use app like feeling well one metrics determine need tested. really get point comment. 

When using science crafting public policy, want ensure method rigorous conclusions reached sound. study shows none things. 

Unless I'm supposed blindly agree reported findings. Movement restriction regions help, still lockdown? protect born give damn born. Send kids school slaughtered US. means child deserves die? people saying “it doesn’t affect young people” means it’s fine obese kids die (and weight even fault)? physician, require robust evidence common sense. thank opinion. PA. standard people tested. Little contact tracing. things could enforced state national level.

With right testing tracing - know high degree certainty guy grocery store without mask indeed pass Covid you. arguments able blame someone global pandemic thus invalid. Really noxious day link published study PR.

Yeah I’m Vietnam family friends back states couldn’t believe went basketball game posted pictures one crowd wearing masks. Fortunately, results they've seen algorithm far false negatives 15-20% false positives. Meaning using app would work, since would result overabundance caution percentage people.

Also, something important keep mind public health numbers game. test like similar vaccine, actually perfect make huge difference. That's true, often acute mortality rates hide serious long term morbidities mortalities may revealed time. Ultimately best get infected potentially harmful pathogens. course matters. Im sure family wishes weight managed better. fact is, 99% chance reason covid hit hard weight. Covid lovkdowns sre cost self isolation failures governments ENFORCING THEM. going say something, fucking enforce it. low jobs... hire people specifically tasked fining are/or arresting people breaking quarantine fucking asshole. dude sounds like real monster. Glad got fuck ! said lockdowns last resort, anybody conservative knew countries still go second third time.  Depending vaccine made factors prevent people vaccinated.

\- Allergies ingredients. common reason people vaccinated. egg allergy, may able get vaccine uses eggs production process

\- Compromised immune system. two parts, first vaccine side effect could wreak havoc bodies. second vaccine less effect body create response it.

\- Rejection vaccine religious personal reasons. controversial. faiths eschew vaccines. moral legal obligation force get vaccine? Lockdown started ofc numbers still high (we're 6 months, we?)  done? would feasible results would expected? wear mask public avoid large crowds, besides live life pre-pandemic. way I'm locking though, we're dealing bubonic anthrax here. everyone gets vaccinated, though. didn’t keep adding obese. 

What kids died? weren’t obese. What’s reasoning there?

Obviously overweight doesn’t help people, disease not. don’t disrespectful dead, especially it’s kid. already bail countries back first wave well? impressive. No, also pretend kids without comorbidity heightened risk, they're not. 99% chance died covid overweight. doesnt make less tragic. overweight kids risk. Normal weight kids not. Doesnt matter still person, someones child. same. wife critical healthcare worker, got job offer company NZ. 

We're waiting license transfer visa approval packing bags. Likely ever return US, regardless wins election. I’m sure 75% effectiveness good enough. preventing way many hospitalizations. Italy Spain. Sweden Belarus never locked down. Japan, never locked down. overwhelming evidence ideas actually help Yep. Lockdown politics middle upper class people shifting risk blame onto lower class workers. Ahh common sense then. 

Some studies shown kids tend spread disease. Others shown otherwise. Studies either way critics.

But view based opinion nothing else, nothing learn you. Whatever. He's getting free ride. needs lay low grateful instead trying dictate roommates live lives top contributing. AFAIK:

PCR Test - looks covid RNA 
Blood test - looks antibodies 
Antigen test - looks characteristic protein component virus 


Please correct dont remember right. Since seem unable understand saying, let make clear :)

When modders delete stuff, give Redditor chance contact mods comments questions it. 

When debate started, Redditor claimed able spread virus antibodies. Since virus really good spreading fomites, got kinda triggered comment wrote rude retort back them. 

They reported comment mods contacted mods. 

That means: ""talk"", ""wrote"" eachother. 

The Redditor realise already first comment mark, deleted message around time mine deleted. 

You already written personally complained comments long, really seem want apply reading comprehension write all, perhaps try start that? still cant believe people running around “mask exemptions cards”. ran one postal office.

What makes encounter extra different one blood shot eyes, literally coughing like tomorrow, got mad people moving away got close.

Like okay lets follow precious, exempt card, earth going outside clearly sick? Dont family members friends you?

Aside able live absolute freedom domestic restrictions? Wrongly tagged Canada - report occurrences US grocery stores. Spanish Flu 2 years way deadly disease going along fact quite harmful young people. contradiction. late then. think problem question immune response binary rather variable dynamic time. get older, immune system become slower respond sluggish response. population scale washes see generally speaking, immunity robust lasting. maybe less true depending upon specific demographic group talking about. Younger people robust lasting immunity older people, immunity may diminish become less robust grow older. government listen science? closed border China Trump called xenophobic racist, closed Europe called idiot. Could imagine fallout called shutdown February contact trace? Masks recommended scientists summer still controlled studies showing work real world use, mention enforcing would legal disaster. Schools source epidemiological spikes remained open even countries ""did right"" (but spikes) bet hear Belgium again. cause it'll fine. I'd glad proven wrong, COVID far transmissible driven disease prevalence that's low right now. vaccine would least 90 percent effective providing sterilizing immunity population would need take seems unlikely happen time soon. reason disease prevalence measles (extraordinarily transmissible) low vaccine 97-98 percent effective basically everyone getting immunized early childhood several decades now.

The goal COVID least reduce disease prevalence vaccines making actually infected COVID scary specific effective treatments. turn threat level somewhere common cold seasonal flu, we'll pretty good shape. Certainly good enough shape get back one might call ""normal."" Numbers show 90% deaths particular day accounted within 11 days meaning latest days inaccurate.

What numbers. cell b cell immunity. 

But SARS-1 antibodies faded two three years IIRC. 

Antibodies provide sterilizing immunity. Poor kid.

I wish best health mom &amp; loved ones 💞 always. Flu vaccine stop influenza infections. reduces number often severity. stop them. Sweden's started autumn pump, watch Long term health impacts Spanish Flu primarily associated exposure gestation shortly birth; there's lot data showing long term impacts older children - despite fact Spanish Flu impactful younger groups COVID overall. 

While obviously flu coronavirus different viruses, pretty typical outcome - viral exposure gestation and/or immediately birth often causes complications - disrupts mother's health critical developmental time well immature immune system baby. 

Despite scare articles long-term impacts COVID, likelihood material long term impacts asymptomatic infections unlikely otherwise normal children. lot medical reason case. long term COVID symptoms consequence inflammation (e.g., heart issues). Asymptomatic infection pretty much definition means (relatively) low inflammation. COVID scary enough without creating medically implausible long-term side effects children. 


That said, - children becoming spreaders means harm others (whether older people, late-gestation babies!). That's focus on. Kids getting COVID one getting COVID - kids getting COVID means people getting COVID. going cause house parties government absolutely control over. People going suddenly stop partying bars closed. would temporary virus defeated.

We're trying run society here. &amp; upvotes comments. lmao. We're also religious among developed countries obvious effects. couple easy - likely donate-able organs. Especially motorcyclists. heard call ""donorcycles"". Welcome albertabama graphs find internet deaths reported day. Sweden said there's ~11 day delay death reporting. delay exists everywhere Sweden talks it. 

30 days delay reported testing reported deaths highest I've seen. may lower (usually lower means things going badly). 35 days since Sweden cases started rising deaths risen. little weird, rise also gradual first. 

It's obviously mistake think rising cases lead rising deaths, usually higher IFR also. Sweden 2 deaths day summer 200 cases day.  they're 2,000 cases day deaths obviously going rise roughly match. good healthcare prevent long time (along obviously giving people best chance recover). teacher survive infected 18s? permanent damage? Quite possibly. Secondary effects seldom consideration. Much less tertiary ones like this. problem Bergamo less covid deaths triage enforce caused load secondary deaths.

Do source this? end wage subsidies extra benefit payments NZ coincided massive unemployment - expected peak around 6%. rush consumption go back living without restrictions helps counter damage. bad, risk 0.04%, apologise misremembering figure Wow. Impressive methodology. subjects actually get sick reinfection? less sick reinfection? old CCU study one two confirmed reinfections asymptomatic. False.

That enough data reflect ""clear trend"". That's tiny sample size. 

Especially genetic testing required confirm reinfection, resources going towards certain ones likely moderate severe symptoms. 

Last checked hundreds unconfirmed reinfections waiting looked at, vast majority asymptomatic/mild infections. 

Not mention fact majority asymptomatic reinfections bound missed like asymptomatic cases, even since someone previously infected less likely getting tested.

So no, clear trend even trend. small amount data that's bound skew way based collected.

Changing norm always met resistance (seatbelts save lives resisted, non smoking changes seen discrimination, fucking civil rights movement still issue US, airport secuity - hasnt prevented shit, etc.), ppl dont like change crying 'not wearing masks live normal again', theres fucking pandemic none us want shit, yet value feelings wants scientific facts lives others. quicker ppl accept reality stop bitching it, quicker effectively actually handle move on.

The argment ur 'not defending' comparing mask dog leash (fucking lol) commonly presented saying masks infringe civil liberty, masks not, not, never freedom period, mitigation safety others ever since fucking germ thoery discovered, u either accept science ur part cross fingers say jesus take wheel cus ur flat-earther extra chromosome. 

Masks exactly equivalent wearing cloths ur dick balls civilised society, wearing seatbelt save lives, drinking driving putting others risk aka helping prevent Asymptomatic transmission. Obviously u free things anytime like wearing mask dumb, selfish, could get somone killed.

Stop saying getting back ""normal life"". happening next year ALL. go again...

You proving article accurate. Utter denial mired groupthink.

Sweden highest fatality rate Scandinavia, far. sound way rationalize explain away. People keep throwing around paper like proves something. 

First all, looked dozen people, severe SARS cases. 

And show people immunity either SARA COVID, t-cells interaction covid casings. 

Finally, still might need neutralizing antibodies prevent reinfection even t-cells supposed do. Lol true Uh imagine NATO EU headquarters paid part diverse travel seeded population early became endemic. 

But that’s guess. 

Belgium tough lockdown, it’s amazing it’s much worse neighbouring Netherlands given lack lockdown masks there. long vaccine proven safe effective.  we’re mainly trying vaccinate at-risk people healthcare workers end thing feel confident groups extremely unlikely reject vaccine. final end (however long takes) wonder number orphans, suddenly single parent families, US (or heck, around world even). Slap press release terms like IoT, AI cloud powered watch VC bucks roll in.  champions! add word ""it"" right place comment, changes entire meaning completely i'm worried type-o. Yeah true lol doesn’t matter. moment vaccine rolled life change, yes slow return, mood shift sentiment turn. I.e. light end tunnel. can’t fucking wait. that's someone contact with, mean roommate got test? Anti maskers anti vaxxers far far far less population media portrays definitely putting employees harm's way, may want work others since legal anyway? 

Workers get unemployment lose job hours. get exposed Covid maskless diners, since people dining indoors definition people dgaf public health measures. 

I feeling public decide whether patronize long term.  Right I'm talking people partying parking lots people's houses. Much easier ignore social distancing avoid masks bar restaurant. doubt even could Belgian here.

Long story short: structural issue heart Belgium nation.

Basically, Belgium federal state 3 language communities, 2 regions 6 governments. 11.5 million people. Belgian politics dominated specific tensions communities span generations. Politics dominated liberal conservative stream prevalent elsewhere. 

However, given unique structure, parties ruling majority federal level, might relegated opposition regional level. turns Belgian politics 4D chess.

Moreover, complex political setup reflected byzantine bureaucracy already efficient lacked public's trust normal times.

So, comes leadership, easily breaks gets fractured among many voices, power specific domain region.

Belgium went painful government formation lasting 500 days. government currently power installed 4 weeks ago. that, minority government amended exceptional powers constitutional kung fu managed crisis.

All ultimate led failure leadership.

By beginning September cases started rise, politicians buckled several loud voices return normal ease restrictions. Public opinion tired time mismanagement previous government drama formation negotiations.

The net result? People stopped caring. Social life picked again. majority conservative liberal politicians happily picked promulgating schools businesses needed stay open ""at costs"".

8 weeks later are.

Meanwhile experts scientists warned everyone every step way. 

Even 10 days ago, one minister president went national television interview refusing ramp restrictions ""because bring extinguisher house fire"". Barely 48 hours later man convene crisis meeting government...

I'm saying politics alone blame. lot also nature population hang tight habits social life connecting others. politicians carry massive amount responsibility happened. even mean? That’s getting first. Period. Full stop. what’s left 3 billion doses vaccinations, start vaccinating people making widespread. 

You sound like wanted argue sake arguing. doesn’t need work everyone. vaccines 100% Selfish shit, smh. Fuck keeping health check, guess. feel you. really do. Fuck americas weird disrespect 😁 Yep, I'm 30, bit heavy I'll probably less fine long run. wait home till numbers less down... Okay... Cold weather changes behavior though make easier spread covid. wont stop protecting myself, product, others. getting point trying explain convince others worth frustration might actually harm good.

And maybe hard work nothing. mean fairly clear west never going success disciplined parts world. watching numbers rise places better US, worse mistakes slam progress made...knowing (the usa) inevitably going worse. makes question months isolation hardship ending place better rollin dice since everyone seems want roll anyway.

I mean even italy spain anti mask/lockdown riots real hope are, force will, going get control? sounds good, though many bullshit words description (AI, nano, holographic), even though using AI classification valid.  Personally, no. previous lockdown got Jack shit time round. Along rest country paying lockdowns decade, assuming run money starve then.

Edit: Downvotes, lol, love /r/Coronavirus. Lol it’s said stupid don’t feel like writing paragraph telling you’re wrong peak allowing people mild symptoms test themselves, previously people severe symptoms hospital staff tested. new wave, finally testing across-the-board instead limited group. Except additions people allowed tested - mild cases, end hospital dead, affect curves. new infection wave rather seeing delay hidden/untested figures looked like end first wave. Really? graduated high school '03 provisions sick days unless went doctor. There's way mom going pay even $20 take day work sick. want poor people stop getting sick need stop treating school like daycare center. like it’ll make covid general common cold

Im ruining lives many save lives few. Family member not. Thats socialism best destroy peoples lives long run needed save 90 yr old grandmother fat mcdonald's eating father. take empathy shove ass. Ok that's fair. never really proper lock down, gave month half gave up.

No, several states doggedly held lockdowns including New York California. economies devastated far worse states recognized lunacy opened back unenforced repercussions violating terms it.

The Feds cannot institute nationwide quarantine, local authorities institute curfews did. Many mayors governors gave strongly worded warnings stay home follow CDC guidelines quarantining, that's could do. communities curfew could land jail, without COVID. judges incarcerate someone 48 hours will, mental health patients often get scooped Friday land ER, Sunday free go charges filed. individual recognize danger others right thing judge commit hospital. simply law works USA. specifically Fifth Amendment protections for, otherwise person authority arrest another person could keep people incarcerated indefinitely without due process. fundamental Bill Rights individuals never allowed trampled stopped testing effectively reporting cases nobody knows outbreaks it.

This simply true. Tests readily available everywhere now, even 15 minute rapid test. testing increasing, time slowed summer spike fewer people presenting testing stations enforce Covid-19 exposed people actually quarantine. Nobody stopped people leaving homes spreading virus.

Doctors order person held 48 hours hospital police custody judge decides whether person held longer. That's way law plan assist Covid-19 exposed people get help needed.

Actually, Federal Government guarantees hospitals COVID patients' bills paid cannot otherwise pay via government private insurance. Feds also provided funds affected workers paid 14 days missed work directly affected COVID. person becomes unemployed due COVID exhausts 14 days still unable work, get unemployment benefits, even still word President time stating virus deadly.

February 29, 2020 one death due COVID-19 guess definition 'trying' much different President's gave American people months seeing glorious stock market plummet little.

He din't give up, fought us. gave us opportunity collapse anarchy protected people long term. Yes, people going die COVID-19. number much smaller would let country collapse chaos. Every wannabe Neegan praying lockdowns come back sooner rather later.  leader actually learned something covid trying keep people safe. lockdown done right one started four weeks ago. He’s fluffed it. Again. realize mormons liked rave Ya garbage lol literally takes Google search see time sub people presumably aware happening Europe right now. pretty incredible. golf club got £25k grant first lock down, year's free business rates (which equates 17k us). sounds like lot honestly lasted us around 4 weeks hit losses. 

Our furloughed staff also paid 80% government really helped. lucky reopened golf industry went boom people nothing else do, got back track couple months. 

As go second lock small grants available (£3k us) 80% furlough scheme again, little worrying. understand endless pot gold though! 

The government done great job trying financially support businesses, everything else virus fucked unfortunately. There's site called reddit people report weather countrymen concern masks distances - mostly don't. Masks masks, safe way 20-30 people room hours.

Im case, masks slightly slow spread, cannot stop it.

Enrollment slots limited. Participation last two years follow-up. works great find way less annoying n95 face mask. know Feb probably enough filters next year two...or three... You’re actually making arguments things didn’t say all. argument human nature goes norm. even remotely close said. said free gives us power go norm choose. happens people making uproar wearing masks choosing wear them. Yea it’s probably don’t like change examples cited valid, people still things. People still smoke science says shouldn’t (sound familiar?). People still drink drive don’t wear seat belts. would this? don’t feel like anyone power stop them.

The dog leash analogy show animals planet don’t freedom choose make decisions way humans do. direct comparison wearing masks whatsoever; yet correlation humans don’t simply go along something it’s deemed norm like animals will. Whether that’s right wrong different argument I’m trying have. simply implying people forget fickle humans comes things don’t like don’t want free plays part that.

Stop dense starting offshoot arguments. point free human nature coupled fact lot people tired going along restrictions since March. We’re damn tired sooner later, I’ve pointed out, people choose much longer want CAN. Belgium per million. article talking yes...they will. least government takes care people. government crap Bc that’s case every virus earth im even concerned old man dui something outside sit little bro lol actually unlucky. That's kinda respiratory viruses work- people exhale virus sick gotta right spot breathe in. less chance doors higher dispersal rate. zero. people around, higher chance.

So, yes, get walking past someone. virus magically stop spreading knows outside. Oh flaws, nobody perfect. ever one Trump. Thank Christ. human know yet. others alluded to, difference ""sterilizing immunity"" (prevents getting others sick) ""protective immunity"" (prevents getting sick). 

Difference vaccines disease provide different sorts immunity. example, oral polio vaccines given low-income countries Afghanistan give protective sterilizing immunity, actually [caused cases. contrast, injectable polio vaccines given US protective sterilizing.

Given dozens vaccines development COVID-19, may end multiple vaccine options choose from. Literally opposite said. said right. Vaccinate at-risk healthcare workers pandemic over. deaths drop at-risk people vaccinated pndemic over. know anything sociology? Society isn’t deaths low COVIDs secondary problems surpassing problem itself. 

Thanks. Try scheduling trip delaying rescheduling. Looks like he's studied ""which foreign media groups legitimate propaganda"" program taught knows virology. Tegnell sidelined now? significantly - slightly. equalized couple weeks. difference 10 percentage points start.

Those ""slightly"" 10 percentage points 50% significantly takes come mountain skis. 

Yes, go eventually found ways treat outside intensive care. 

Yes, morphine... conservatives lead province shock 1500 nurses died WW1, marker interested. talking explicitly prevalence mask wearing population.

That particular precaution, broad group.

I think lot evidence indicates extremely high rates mask wearing countries referring.

I’m going look anything isn’t disagreement, casting light seemed like deliberate attempts derail.

Ask comments referred comments, headline. Wow. Great news. used work MSK earlier. virus schedule... Ofc explain don’t actual argument Right? work considering staying open found loophole. Absolute joke end distancing enough vaccinated reasonable degree herd immunity. Vaccinating at-risk people (however want define that) health care workers isn’t going end it. people stop distancing would accelerate pandemic. Im curious too. extremely ominous soundbite mean? throw mask washing machine every night.

However, fomites shown minimal risk COVID, think worry unduly stuff staying mask/clothing/vegetables/etc. now? feeling get realise government, state federal, ALP LNP gives shit told someone work today life never wanted wrong.

I pride recalling facts random information. point I'm telling story something read years ago pause find right information. 


So world could please put place show wrong would probably cry tears joy. Unfortunately covid real. Also lot easier follow. Pulling masks time (which tend do) somewhat risky easy forget fuck up. sound mature people desperate kill people pull 6 year old articles wayback machine, change title add dramatic comment. Or, failing order government, school principals did? PTA? kids themselves, internet access? mean
Isn't curfew? Sorry would someone need expert this? Isn’t clear everyone still cases it’s gonna keep spreading? Look Taiwan/China/NZ handled trough one big lockdown spread... EU won’t eradicate virus keep comes back again. it’s even worse USA + even brain dead people. THIS! Even glimmer hope changes anyone's overall mood. know I, one, longer take anyone love granted. Tomorrow promised hope formal wedding moved back year 2021 November somewhat back normal! Nah like making fun people make weird statements like reddit. said “I get stereotype” understand people reddit make fun americans even though it’s representative I've seen studies associate reopening schools outbreak clusters. numbers rise vacationists returned far tell spread bars etc., large number ""unknown"" sources. Schools, we'd test classmates would known sources infections.

I may wrong. article headline simplistic headline still inaccurate... Blame people writing BS clicks. degree? isn't, outlaw rock climbing, skydiving, riding motorcycles, etc? certainly line liberty important safety. Considering times threats overflooding hospitals come true this, sure productive stories are.

They sell advertising. Like, people always vague make comments “new normals”.

Yeah, bet working home staying home sick stuff “never see again” .... darn .. /s 

Maybe wearing mask *only sick*. Seems reasonable.

More hand sanitizer stores? Fine me.

Things I’m talking talk normal:

 - able gather crowds, go weddings, concerts, musical theatre, restaurants/bars 

 - able travel - maybe China - Europe, various parts US, Canada. 

 - able return office choose it’s way better working environment sitting living room

 - wearing mask perfectly healthy. Seeing people’s faces smiles.

 - kids able attend school play friends instead wearing masks, sitting distances desks surrounded glass barriers &amp; assigned ‘play circles’ 

 - told avoid friends family unless live roof do, treating every human threat health 

Now, obviously stuff stated won’t return snap finger (or rather, prick needle). vaccine start gradual slide back towards this, see things get better better people get vaccinated &amp; less less people ending hospital covid-19. Wonder US get version Korea' doom day's church. thing. everyone chance catching COVID. segment population higher chance. COVID burn thru first infection decrease. wording issue.

You literally admitted *no sources* yourself. *That's* mocking you, realizing fact I'm mocking might want little thinking replying. Thats bloody wrong know that! general Virus tend live longer cold dry climate. Tropical climate hot moist good bacteria bad viruses like Corona. Every evidence around glove supporting far.

And main method infection via prolonged contact closed venues. open infections seldom. happens summer? people outside, venues like restaurants open windows 24/7 circulate. winter everyone starts go inside, people ventilate less bam, heavily encrease chance infections. summer infections overall germany, whether started get colder went significantly. people still argue back school nothing fall emergency?  Reinfection chance low especially new reports immunity coming support claim im making point like it’s hard give serious attention Say sorry resigning, sad idiot. Heh even think got post sarcasm. Because, per question, understanding users sub dislike Americans and, per replies, get emotional quickly conducive anything constructive. Unpopular opinion: would fewer pandemics didn’t eat dead animals. basically response Great Barrington declaration?  Look dude, I’m denying immunity long lasting not. BUT, chance getting reinfected asymptomatic still there. first case reinfection ever announced asymptomatic man tested traveling. think everyone needs bubble isolate human interaction indefinitely? No, don’t. Hell, posted question asking outdoor kbbq go to. fact there’s still chance get reinfected still spread thing big enough mindful fact anything super risky could lead super spreader event. Yes, Covid containment strategy predicated college kids making responsible decisions, already failed.  catching COVID walking past someone. Relax. Victoria 4th day 🍩 cases. Lockdown 111 days rain doughnuts. 

Also god hope right twitter Nope, kept transferring covid positive nursing home staff facility facility. That's much really care protecting vulnerable. get unemployment lose job hours

Illinois unemployment caps 26 weeks, many restaurant workers hit limit year. possible petition extension due COVID, lot workers going end homeless instead. numbers you’ve seen individual countries’ purchases. Sixty million here, thirty million there, adds up. 

Three billion fucken’ doses. Amazing. Yes early reports rather rocky disease progression feel like getting better set back. need shut place totally two weeks give health care system chance catch up. 300,000 people currently infected? Thats insane, almost 3% population Covid. what's store rest world without immediate action. Strict lockdown measures vaccine deployed essential preventing us ration care. care friends, family, communities make sure reason end wrong end triage tent dingy hospital parking lot. Re-opening party locations bars, importing corona holidays across borders - could guessed outcome?

On September 20th, did, based official statistics. Greetings Germany. Regional areas must loving it. responding guy literally said masks single handedly save day ""Hate breakit work."" see people saying ""he's right though"" right?

Your nuance indeed finely nuanced. True. IFR may vary factor 2. Case count (testing hit rate) easily vary factor 10. watching 'serious/critical' stat worldometer. looks like US adding 50-100 count everyday currently sitting 17,300. number system cannot provide care? possible limited healthcare workers get late year. Big rollouts happen Q2 2021. everyone masked up. Phrases like ""pretty sure"" ""somehow doubt"" imply person leaving door open discussion calming know everything. welcome disagree might want little thinking replying. Imagine different number would president actively embraced wearing masks? constant briefings w public, wore everywhere etc.  imagine lot supporters would wearing masks dear leader effect restrictions? mean saying it'll never normal? normal? B- counts years unlike 2020 work hotels amount people traveling ridiculous. Florida, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Tennessee, North Carolina. People started going weddings starting September.

Of course share deniers/non-compliers, but, state locked mask mandates less followed entire time.

If half states/countys taking seriously goes shit, regardless complied. NW burbs, nobody following restaurant ban, nobody enforcing it. fun ranting Pritzker trying wreck state removed toilets...blah blah blah. type mutations thankfully really happen.  America chosen take different path. free make poor choices kill hundreds thousands people. already much country much normal USA - get control contact tracing seems working really well. Obviously can. yet? waiting on? feel like similar Disney's reopenings. zealous people pack boats initially, surge die people want part it. show months contributed cases. emphasis short term economic gains hinderance.  ""Everything bigger Texas"" 

Peter Griffin “Models scientists suggest unless act now, could see deaths winter twice bad compared first wave,” Johnson expected say, according office.

5% population infected first wave. really think 10% population even could catch second wave? Still waiting prove it, it’s pretty funny keep commenting yet continue dodging main question want answered. continue emotional see city PD still refusing enforce order. Pretty sure judge file charges Chief PD dereliction malfeasance obstruction something.. Yeah, pandemic lasted 2 years. Wait hit 2 yrs covid-19 compare. Back normal soon 😎 🇺🇸  winter people about. 

Furthermore, countries winter already started, people kept wearing masks (like new Zealand) winter related illnesses like flu dropped significantly. 

So hope see encouraging results.

New Zealand locked winter, closed border,, that's flu season much pandemic issues. Merica ain't much things, anticipate New Zealand like outcome US. something completely different expecting good results. Unfortunately viruses work like that. (This information Walgreens COVID test site) tests run PCR tests live virus. tests sent lab get results back 3 - 5 days. locations rapid testing, aren’t different kind test, it’s test, it’s processed on-site get results quicker.

As far I’m aware proteins test less accurate one, isn’t widely performed anymore.

Then there’s antibody test, I’m sure locations perform those. others take back. Super spreaders country. Source? Damn sucks Im American living France honestly im tired everyone shits others. million total deaths worldwide disease time empathy finger pointing mocking loved ones who've past. Majority world handling bad nothing else need wake realize humans need get shit together children facing horrible future. know feel like thats fairy dream we're past point salvation hope overcome come end compassion other. Stay safe people love hard cuz never know whats gonna happen. Yes. Im aware that. dont get downvotes. happens ever open back up? bet virus come right back. Considering spread undetected long time fucking slippery slopes. mountain, dude. Wtf even talking about? 

Why would want go history? could easily make flu go away wearing masks small fraction population; many times less contagious many times less deadly COVID. fact remains reducing COVID mortality 98% barely different reducing 100%. We're upvoting ""all reduce mortality 98%"" comment. mean, duh?  1+1 = 2 correct, regardless says it. Attacking people instead ideas sign genius imo Fortunately vaccines (hopefully) start become factor next months - they're best shot breaking awful cycle. Everything know virus far tells us indoors, talking shouting, mask crowding perfect condition super-spreading events. Especially participants self-selected taking fewer precautions recommended. 423 cases would ~24 cases per 100,000 people (WV population ~1.8 million people). hospital currently “full”. lots beds shortage nurses. 

We actually less full normal many nurses quarantined. mean becoming President pretty impressive accomplishment whether like guy not. sure are. less relevant term whenever think last time ok use it. look dictionary definition word retarded actually find perfectly applicable describing people who, well, say retarded things. large enough supply give everyone thus rationed? smell shite. There's way suddenly popped capacity test many people one day. 

""More 40,000 medics"". empty hospitals? There's around 30,000 registered nurses Slovakia, many retired, many gone work neighbouring countries pay 2 3 times higher politics also corrupt core put past pulling fast one. Halloween saw lot kids Trick Treating without masks on. small groups, generally okay. then, groups kids ran other, merged bigger groups. Kids excited see other. Soon mobs 20-30 kids, masks off.

So yes, week probably spike among kids, generally asymptomatic, spread adults time Thanksgiving. sure hell ain't board ""new normal"" crap. vaccine's widely distributed I'm going back normal. narrative recommendations real scientists doctors actually quite clear. fault unable understand scientific process realize recommendations standard procedures change learn disease, fault vet sources information ensure getting qualified expert. Harping saying 8 months ago irrelevant since everyone else already moved understood said based known time. Never said people still comply we'll still need practice social distancing etc avoid spike cases. fully expect mask wearing compliance social distancing compliance fall quite abit next summer Except proven case strict criteria almost useless determining many cases have.

So ill ask - datq would use? glad governor LEADING using SCIENCE fix I’d lockdowns rate supported Spring. support mask mandate best option now.  No, won't. Welcome reddit mentality. Lmao downvotes Underrated comment right rushed, uk able accelerate review ongoing “challenge” trial basically infects people vaccinated virus obviously volunteers. gotcha, fault misinterpreting. 

Fauci knows fighting good fight go right side history! medical authorities Portland came strongly it, would listen. like others said, among best nation summer protests every single night. It’s risk-free, it’s almost certainly safer walking grocery store example.

We outbreaks Portland now, things beginning turn worse. vigilant following covid-19 outbreaks multnomah county indication (yet) coming protests. Yeah people type shit actually idea something like actually entails Michigan, multiple times. governor plot kidnap busted FBI, I’d say didn’t great effect. Well, isn’t big surprise nowhere.?Why didn’t somebody warn Americans that,
if virus got control demand ICU beds may outstrip supply causing triage situation? Hell, even nasal spray. Wanna bet economy end better yours? lesson thing end shut one way other. Honestly thanks posting helped come terms it.. whenever know find nothing best way go work out. Answering post worked feel good going back old normal.. old normal 🤞 Might well be. Stubborn pricks.  really, really doubt vast majority people accept another summer/holiday season social distancing. cant wait election tell friends family told so, country start take seriously Talked kind lady last week got kicked top kidney transplant list developed minor breast cancer. Every single selfish fuck went. expression. basically saying OK contribute spread deadly virus global pandemic order protest cause support. That's slipper slope, friend. Yeah, [Green Tag versus Black 100% closed though? essential workers truck drivers Slovak citizens cross? not, COVID's coming back. Emotional? I'm person data side. one that's sad data support feelings... I'm one saying mean absolutely nothing anybody. one whining like little child. Massive projection, kid. Joking aside, kind disaster triage usually saved mass casualty incidents. Black Tags ones cannot save - Green Tags “walky talkies”. never thought I’d see use something similar hospital setting though, that’s insane me. meanwhile 18 countries Europe worse case per 100,000 averages US

so yeah like entire western world struggling mental health right now, surely bunch stupid american rubes know what's good them. inconsistent messaging politicians? lack testing capacity? people forced back work social safety nets place? that's fault wanting hug grandma!! sub broken, people actually look data get downvoted calling pointless moral oneupsmanship, like jesus christ Good luck! got dinged last week. Plenty deniers surrounding states traveling Illinois last 5 months. I'm sure that's majority issues come from. complied lock downs mandated masks since beginning. costs? Seems like state hospital association wanted governor’s okay statewide policy. though societal disruption polio epidemics first half 20th century. despite fact polio extremely mild even asymptomatic vast majority kids caught it; outbreak area people moved try prevent infection small number kids would inevitably draw short straw. This

And they’re good people aside that. don’t openly talk politics anything usually. they’re close friends pretty much like guy said 😂 sorry, mistake. right Sterilization. say like Americans would listen international org. sucks but, even perfect, Americans would still stupid heed advice. 

The president anti-masker cult following; statement foreigners going make listen science godking. Lol fun

 hope let come home few, compared total population, pack bars. EVERYONE going school work people go school work. cares bars 8 metro/bus PACKED. measures wont break infection chains. PERIOD. im sorry, dont understand whats about. Still deflecting, like it’s hard prove I’m going keep calling it. Like said someone allegedly almost elderly adult seem getting pretty emotional comments made random person internet. Reopening happen. Governments going give power willingly  Ignore troll. think Trump Jr going run 2024. customers die would good incentive lmao. plenty countries underreported. Indonesia’s situation doesn’t surprise all. Back would showed certain subset people people actually getting it. Opt out. really do. Every person stays home reduction risk community whole. think health-care system handle two different viruses similar flu winter year long case COVID? ... Nope.   Looks grim Caribbean region especially.

I guess lockdown worked lol. Exactly. I’m actually Portland. Idk people downvoting comments. Medical authorities pretty explicit lack cases traced protests. It’s Fox News right wing talking point It’s lockdown. It’s restrictions according official release. reap sow. 

Decades religious anti-intellectualism, fundamentalism, corporatism authoritarianism - endorsed ‘but muh rights’ crowd. 

Coming home roost. 

Vote Tuesday - perhaps rebuild something humble successful. think Wall-E emotions. people least. DAAAAD! Mods. Internet janitors can't confirm fact control. get control, remember reaction watching Chinese military essentially lock people homes? OK US same? okay torrent aware many states Australia entirely COVID free months? WA completely normal 6 months now. Lockdowns, aggressive testing quarantine work bud. Sure everyone going willing honest. Sure. cases asymptomatic spreading around. contagious fully eradicate also lethal all. course didn’t. World Health Authority doesn’t exist. criticism organizations taken seriously demonstrate least know organization called. Organization. 1918 put toe tags living efficient nurses. could point. cousins huge house well.
Amazing sure. idiots vocal get media exposure. obviously apply people military think I'll get lot sooner age. ""two weeks slow spread""

eight months later... masks wearing majority country. need masks virus eliminated. Never wore masks state. pm proof want probably won’t though you’re lying lol **Nov. 2, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

The government divided nation seven zones, level zone determined based average number daily infections per Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* you: compare country countries see badly guys doing!

me: /compares country countries see badly we're doing

you: like that!! Human beings truly plague planet, sad true. Halloween parties cause? I’m travel nurse working Level 1 trauma hospital New England. hospital already capacity. patients staying PACU, post op recovery area, overnight sometimes days room them. COVID-19 patients already climbing. winter going worse last year. 🙄 God would anything able move Canada ha I'm here, reaching stranger might help feel less isolated alone. advantage feel step house, pretend everything's fine, act errands like smiling robot instead screaming see manager of... everything. Looking we're going think we're looking much much better season. Fingers crossed! Yeah never really lock live, weeks heavy restrictions around Easter time. yes live back normal. Well worth considering lives saved peace mind. ignorant comment blow mind though. think part world failed means everywhere else outcome. great outcome actually try stop virus, much better letting burn society causing death weaker economy. That's contact tracing quarantine/self-isolation measures come in. They're much easier carry vastly effective curve flattened. 

Also, countries lockdown small cluster. implement stricter temporary measures (i.e. smaller group size limits) new cluster contained. See New Zealand handled it.

Of course, measures going work people literally refuse follow recommendations. even worse people, especially one's leaders, attack health experts deny recommendations. might want ask anti-lockdown pushers like Atlas provide zero evidence support claims. First all, celebrating?

Do *want* case? No!

*Is* though? Well, guess since everybody seems forgotten pandemic let guard down, virus going subdue second (in places haven't, course). They'll forced eat words second lockdown comes. words, yes. many people despise Pritzker beyond me. think we're gonna come ""surge"" ""wave"" whatever looking kind bad, mostly legal stuff went, considering Chicago state's population, Pritzker really good job listening advisers first surge March April. really think state shutdown point, know much ability way Darren Bailey stuff went. love guy around, thought COVID response among better country begin with. Yeah, unfortunately it’s easy stop. Halloween parties hand kinda trivial. places going brutal holiday season year. Right, tell sport wears protective clothing? 

Also, I’m US. way American football, real “football”. Sure, people care rights. Wall-E job! Witchcraft!!! pandemic, big portion death burried outside Jakarta..
 
during pandemic, number burial Jakarta almost doubled..
 
Jakarta still data actual excess death though.. lost family member virus, level rage president, followers every person ignored virus anyone take seriously. still taste caviar fine wine? Sorry, others problem, pay I'm problem. Sounds like use error. so? worth civil unrest? fact control US doesn't? No, court room. Much closer mayor county think judge. valid concern. current situation seems imbalance availability certain hospital services. areas, ICU beds, areas excess service capability (e.g. preventative imaging) people avoiding annual checkups. One easily morphed other. Ok? Hospitals CYA lawsuits maybe. triage spins going angry people. Saw q-anon graffiti highway North QLD Huntington, WV resident here. zero trick treaters last night, hoping learned lessons previously started act like (I’m FB “local” social media).  Obviously I’m myself. Looks like things going start getting worse across country get betterzzzzz almost there's covid covid covid. Actually yes.

Unfortunately government.

But could people demanded instead demanding schools reopen. point. No, county judge texas normal judge. executive office county. like mayor county. hear cases, usually lawyers. order whoever work home must work home (previously recommendation, order), can't continue going work (e.g. construction, manufacturing). Also lockdown watching rest Australia get back normal enjoying life, definitely incentive. Oh yeah absolutely, sorry insinuating guys better there, thought interesting 3 different levels testing closure, US testing even teacher way us closing entire school 2 weeks.

I fully believe Canadian border properly close guys would better, yeah said tricky situation, logistics wise politically.

Our politicians closed state borders hardest either slammed Liberals shit flinging (not US liberal, see below) they're run Labor, federal opposition right now, enjoying high approval rates among citizens, case premier Dan Andrews Victoria, quite lot both.



In Australia, two major parties federally, LNP (Liberal-Nationals Party) ALP (Australian Labor Party.) LNP right wing current federal government, made Liberals, Nationals party, basically liberals ""hard workin aussie bush battlers."" Basically Liberal Lite rural Australia. ALP centre left party, currently federal opposition, go party working class rich. Labor power 5/8 states territories, LNP controls remaining three, although one three NSW makes almost third Australia's economy population, overall country evenly split LNP/ALP. happens even one person goes radar infects others? Lockdown again? makes sense. parties important human lives anyway. No. WSJ paywalled. really think 10% population even could catch second wave?

The second wave going end April, that’s least five months compared one month first wave. Stock pre pandemic levels. 

But demand still little higher normal crazy probably starting normalize. Pandemic definition: (outbreak disease) prevalent whole country world

H1N1's numbers still similar started particularly bad year last year.


So yes, still around. condescending want, one wrong.

Did take time actually look either two things mentioned them?

I think so. think that’s looks Turmeric cause Cytokines storms. fact supplements usually much safer medications often work better. Big pharmaceutical companies don’t like true. buying supplement companies. *That's* 'real question' offer? costs well associated pretty much letting run rampant won’t fully understood many years. can’t undead people, tough. never do. Yep, states already implemented victoria next couple steps. states It’s recommended carry go crowded places put order minimise risk.  think there's also confusion county judges Texas actually judges (they hear cases required lawyers). They're highest elected office county. remember kid getting cold times sense smell taste went haywire. I'm assuming might coronavirus.

In wikipedia says 15% colds caused coronaviruses Agree mate. simple ""oh okay. Better get then"". think wanted part get done with. Every website shoving cookies anyway. one clear do. clicked configure rejected all. political landscape bad Americans always like self flagellate. It’s like EU UK much better. Exactly. This. literally making point thanks lol love know debates lockdowns.

What debates? Lockdowns server intended purpose control outbreak via elimination (see NZ Australia) or, commonly, bringing numbers levels would allow effective contact tracing quarantines/isolation. also part 'Swiss cheese' strategy works extremely work followed things like mask mandates, social distancing enforcement work home recommendations.

There's literally data support virtually every country lockdown, especially followed stringent measures after. countries also tend better long term. laws/amendments

Viruses diseases don’t care Hopefully get another outbreak soon killing lockdown fantasies. even remotely. Michigan bad first wave April hospitals legit full COVID patients. Today loads empty beds ICU regular. easily created stopping elective surgeries necessary.

What media isn’t telling treatments knowledge COVID improved tremendously. People getting treated better faster aren’t staying hospital long getting sick enough vent. hate people. Oh not, denier science can't eat drink wearing mask bars restaurants high risk matter what. confirm, live Utah County people idiots Probably already said Melbourne's leadership (labor) massive landslide prior lockdown people supportive state government. additional general Australian culture particularly concerned individual rights (unlike somewhere like U.S personal freedoms concern country founded civil war etc). Generally Australians pretty chill trusting government especially man Dan.

Furthermore, think Australian culture (like many countries well) pride community helping other, eg. look bushfires start 2020, 'Australian' help support communities, think people understood needed did. 

Long answer hopefully helps :) I'm downplaying risks face saying work essential. Hell, last year basically janitor. vitally important jobs connected hospital seems like one untrained volunteer could likely brought do. 9.5 Million active cases? main threads completely broken right now

""everything US numbers joey bismarck's fault expects science work like magic wants hug grandma! saying decades systemic economic issues, legal blockades preventing strong federal response, cultural socialization might play role? saying look Europe's horrifying numbers wonder what's going too? surely must insane!!!"" Unfortunately, live county, 25 minutes site event. also county went summer:  Climate Australia ranges lot. doubt huge affect beyond seasonal flu (more people doors, dry air is). US Europe shown transmission certain level, fully open, little policy compliance, viruses spread regardless. Imagine living country saw 100k new cases day time attend party nearly 1000 people. type person would thing? bad one Sadly, it’s folks caused outbreak suffer. It’ll people following guidelines like elderly healthcare workers suffer. That's also headline particularly useful.

If 30% testing positive people tested symptomatic, really shocking. they're testing everyone healthy not, I'd expect lower. 

This mean 30% Wisconsinites infected. 
That said, WERE, asymptomatic, could double-edged sword. one hand means virus affect lot people severely - good news. hand means people likely unknowingly spread it. using BinaxNow rapid state sites now. Apparently request PCR, I'm reading right rapid antigen tests. I'm sure state data going break  Good question, stupid! 

At least state, state certification required both. either go training apply whatever agency want work get hired untrained agency put training. experience police departments likely hold academies, coworkers either come another agency put training. 

My former department hires people already trained work patrol officers. Working deputy jail require state certification though, decent in-house training program. Many start either certified not, send people academy state certification prove decent want go. say decent jail deputies never pursue state certification. care moving patrol becoming supervisor dig (and great it!).   Thanks! Exactly, get risk people healthcare workers back normal fast shit Well politicians bright moral usually, definitely ridiculously high level right now. put supreme court justice bench can't vote stimulus bill? many politicians incompetent except comes seizing power Winnipeggers problem R’s here. It’s high time identity politics thrown away. It’s tough mention even funding, people like, kids go great schools. problem is, school aren’t great, kids start behind. Neoliberalism rampant here. Dems Reps don’t seem understand common don’t. Kids need eat sure, schools feed answer. created robust online learning system hired twice teachers. again, like alluded to, pockets can’t greased, people fight get kids school gross meals come cardboard boxes. It’s pits. Agreed - kids grow fast, know trust parents educate them. even read it? It’s specifically Jakarta. even posted relevant paragraph explain Jakarta’s issues lack space.    reason believe anyone attending infected begin with? though. really want blow communal tube respiratory pandemic? stay mandatory though. Helps lot airborne diseases.  sea view cabin ventilator, please? Good you. tell immune-compromised neighbour happy sacrifice life freedom. jackasss rooomate handed candy trick treaters last night zero concern fact lives two people high risk complications due covid19.  continually visit friends go state (one even spent weekend NC cases spiking significantly there) people like nothing going on.  One roommate refuses even discuss pandemic like something wrong ask address real concerns.  I'm fucking done all.  lost career pandemic owe 3 months rent said roommates threatening kick despite nationwide ban evictions refuse sign document turn leasing office. claim eviction ban ""fake news"" despite shown actual government fucking website information it.  protect everyone else go fucking hell. home staying room I'm sealing vent room.  leave room reason going start wearing mask. 7 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

Try spin however like, that’s happened. work office ~6-8 folks. young clearly aren’t sweating covid. ages remove masks they’re need talk phone. AC, windows open. try limit time overlapped others there’s way completely also job involves supervising junior guys.

I’m trying say life isn’t black white instead it’s million shades grey trying navigate world tough. terms enforcing covid stuff ya they’re irresponsible one shouldn’t able pick choose. I'm expecting anything vaccine developed less 2 years research. Florida restrictions thousand-person conventions happening weekly Much more. Much much more. I'm actually teaching person online time. one every forty people contract covid die. really like odds. odds big enough think two class rooms, least one kid die. lucky. always healthy B blood types innate immunity virus act selfish preventing spread virus like wildfire.

All people A+ blood type vulnerable deadly virus account majority population. Think many young children A+ blood either suffer greatly die.

As healthy male. I've virus wreck heart lungs. wish anyone.

PS. downvoted single one comments. Europe's lockdown joke though - half countries like Netherlands still half-assed mask-wearing. People still allowed go long like 'exercise'. Lots house visits.

In Aus, leave max 5km house, per day, 1 hour.  
In Singapore, mingling different households.

You need proper lockdown. Russia’s death toll much higher official numbers indicate. Take look Russia’s excess 83,000 excess deaths March July alone, latest data available — *six times higher* official COVID death toll period. knows much increased since past 4 months. Again, child, obligation verify anything nobody like you. again, stated, verifying moderators. send copy diploma. Again, check back days (as hanging wall office back work Tuesday). take less, amount work teach online? Also, thanks input. Yeah, weird title, even think people Texas know are. Hell, work county government regularly. 

They executive county though. Dan lot hatred too. Fuck man worst year prime minister/premier fault that, assumed enforced everywhere. Well, then, thing get away outbreak sorrounded selfish pricks Yes, pretty lucky lockdown occurred winter. summer coming think we're eager relieved things looking decent. hope northern hemisphere get handle things winter. We're 71,125 day compared 63,737 last Sunday. Good 11.6% increase day's numbers complete yet. Lol yeah sure. Calling insanely hyperbolic nonsense definitely means I’m Russian troll. You’re hilarious. Lol I’ve worked medlabs years think least find real photo random tube labeled “coronavirus +” significant portion customers stop giving company money refuse spend money testing them? No? Welp CEO bonuses then, thank goodbye stars night, big bright.... seriously, look X top right corner banner ""pay wall."" pay wall, gotta read confusing Canadian guy living Germany.

You get title ""Judge"" unless passed bar exam.  percentage based new people tested. testing percentage positive half that. Still high, number misleading. Lmao “America great” finished

Cant wait till rednecks country realize literally level india china even delaying operation. would planning infrastructure operation executed. 

Let's hope email accurate time frame though.

But wonder would kept quiet. Perhaps happen people go crazy? That’s really common endurance athletes like cyclists runners. I’m cross country coach pretty much varsity athletes low 50s, sometimes upper 40s. Mine varies amount I’m training. I’m running 3-4 days/wk right I’m upper 50s, low 50s running 6-7 days/wk several months straight spring. dont even know im wtf talking about. know nothing situation country 

And know nothing China. Use archived page here: Man, Russian trolls full force today. problem Tories are, first time lives, forced think like socialists put people first profit. They're struggling clue think people mates. last 32 years 50/50 far R goes. 16 each. It’s simple. rotten place.  would anyone want shoot foot purposefully hampering economy? we'll see government attempts trace people going this, sure. without covid, reason, all, force people wear masks distance compare Australia, assumed Australia impossible compared places therefore implied improvement possible Jeff Bezos disgusting piece shit stingily hoarding wealth global crisis, could much good world yet essentially told sick, poor struggling fuck die. blood hands. ex left trashy greedy capitalist pig, give away vast amounts wealth leaving stop vomiting thought daily basis. world see too. wouldn’t touch slimy ass ten foot pole.  articles trying dampen impact vaccine ridiculous. even point, dumbass. Also got paywall 54 low? Fuck off. Went busy convenience mart southern iowa, good local hospitals. 15 people saw, one wore mask So, ignorance “in.” Noted. Sorry loss. us take seriously want protect families much possible. trying maintain sanity thinking office things get better. burning bodies simpler, faster cheaper? Despite downvoted legitimate question. think definitive answer correct balance policy long done. think victorian earnt small celebration time being.  Yes, alt, abandoned one year pandemic. name Torrent. everyone got flu vaccine every year would less issue  say anything Trump administration? Hilarious reading dude telling someone stop propaganda stating China treating people well. Unbelievable. still amazes managed eradicate smallpox 1970s. One humanity’s greatest achievements IMO Florida [The Agency Health Care oversight hospital operation, state level involvement. would expect, facilities became strained, would take active role directing traffic. like murder mystery cruise...except already know killer be. first image I've seen actually looks healthier least time prior getting Covid. Go back look photos 2019, dude looks rougher quite bit. Singapore, Vitenam, Aus far contact trace. went lockdowns almost harsh China. agree first part. vehemently disagree blaming vocal minority everyday people problems.

Masks mandatory Victoria, assume numbers stay like longer end month. I'm gonna honest meant type ""that's"" noticed lol ""that's totally right""

And yet follow long paragraphs condescension falsehoods still make sound like I'm wrong. 

""But also strike significantly less risky going store yourself""

Well bad virus care ""strikes you"" here. Person-to-person transmission biggest risk here, period. go fomite transmission, proven lot less risky person-to-person. likely see spikes Halloween night? next weekend? Thanks, informative! Sadly heavily outnumbered idiots Unless risk work job given priority vaccine (healthcare example) able get long time.  Hopefully impacted ability go peasant hunting Balmoral Sandringham leech modern society. Wisconsin loses 50 day covid19. saying SD 50 times worse death rate? That’s people like hear around here.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think fined anyone that. supply get stretched. It’s distribution o2 supply that’s problem. manufacturing problem. enough delivery drivers trucks go every hospital. 


What happen NY never happen anywhere else. Alternate Care Sites last resort. ever watched movie contagion it’s exact scenario. wish... he's almost 2. means going half life. 

All friends like us (won't hang all)... one quarantine friend baby, age. really hard... everytime exposed see another 2 weeks.

I actually worry lot him. think could havelife time effects.  sees people we're always pulling away.... kid talked everyone. No. Businesses like McDonald's restaurant consider essentiall close, thus anything... accounting dumbasses that. minority

All either us anecdotal evidence. constantly see people wearing mask, dropping talk people. perhaps 50% time? claim widespread, little evidence either way. mean killed 50% people lock voluntarily? There's another definite answer for. Could several things, like seeing numbers spike finding spreading amish family members like wildfire. Actually... may around time caught it. Either way, bought cloth ones super tight like ones given employer, learned deal it.

Now useful vaccine comes around safe wear anymore, likely won't. still sucks. Damn must poppin work restaurant. feel sick schedule 10 days even get tested test negative Covid.

So everyone now? report sick get tested. is, that's mentioned keeping numbers manageable level. overwhelm hospitals. Thanksgiving really thing Germany, already worried christmas usually huge family gatherings (like in-laws extended family 12/24, parents siblings partners 12/25, extended family including aunts, uncles, cousins etc. 12/26) restaurant visits.

Thankfully, mom pretty much sent ""christmas cancelled year"" message weeks ago. worry lot in-laws \~70 \~80 years old, suffer diabetes weight issues, feel like neither partner's siblings careful enough probably expect celebrate christmas least 10 guests hospitals area starting reach capacity right large influx Covid patients. I'm sure we're going come year. link actual source. plenty misinformation around. CDC source found shows quite opposite. Excess deaths predictions, factor estimates trends, age overall population, etc. way actual death rates year. amount people dying month increase January,

It actually every year, always deaths around holidays. I've seen people making mistake 2020 less deaths previous years using linear approximation ignores fact. That's really sad family. 1/3rd people feel like sick /s

I know Republicans still keep trying make basic safety measures like wearing mask reducing Covid deaths political issue. know prevent getting covid19.  difficult concept people grasp? coronavirus never end United States til vaccines...people selfish! see many big groups partying posting fb, started blocking friends reason is... What's point? would certainly former.

A country's IFR largely depend size elderly population, Belgium's elderly population much higher world. Belgium probably turn somewhere 0.5-1% range. smell another goalpost shift... flu vaccine effective scientists forecast strains circulation mutates rapidly. covid vaccine expected match variants. Gas stations harbinger germs. Think many people touch dispenser screen nozzle throughout day everyday getting wiped like grocery store keypads registers. 

That's one place would recommend using gloves. Put get car pull garbage touch car door handle get back pumping. finale sad, great way finish monkey test absolutely massive dose though. Luckily far looks like flu well. 

Covid restrictions much seasonal flu, R0 never goes 1 areas. people becoming long term permanently disabled loss function, people need ongoing medical care decades done, think massive drain health care system be, continue decades perhaps even next century. Also people public constantly touching masks whether pulling even putting pockets taking out. They’re talking eating public moments. knows hands whether air breathing moments mask Covid particles floating around. fear propaganda everyone starting realize scamdemic that, scam. People realize covid threat speaking unnecessary government control. sketchy vaccine around corner one wanting try something bring fear back.  cousin 60's died early pandemic. get funeral, one could visit hospital. like disappeared. terrible. people fucking stop? get it, sucks. want stay safe, want parents safe want able go visit them. None going happen people keep messing up.  know fitness influencer died covid19 recently right? something wife get behind! mean victoria australia? Australia island one goverment. Completly different europe.

Actually we've got one government, Federal government Murdoch death machine pushing us reopen, state government stayed locked control. way mean they'll effective. flu vaccine effective scientists forecast strains circulation mutates rapidly. covid vaccine expected match variants. Well, could see even overworked medical staff. also risk people got infected testing stations. definitely people false sense security negative test. said, right completely different environment set difficulties, solutions, even limited scope nationwide mask enforcement exist paying people enough stay home period tested positive, exist. Given tons money poured Wall Street. 

Look I’m blind political situation shit show. literally single government entity enforce lockdown, even limited sigle cities? genuine question 

For Europe speak italy used live there, disadvantage federal hence isolating hot spots much difficult since regions don’t power lock people likelihood able go restaurant safely 2022, maybe without pandemic sitting back mind 2024

Seems likely. 9% sounds like straight [dialysis ""midsummer"". also gives extremely inconsistent results look state state numbers, making think representative full population. Sounds like someone needs another milkshake. Don’t worry actually BLM/Antifa protest COVID didn’t spread ""We've tried nothing we're options!"" prick. China told Trump. make Trump China puppy? puppy do? disappear Easter, see. usually -70C freezer They're premature results out, especially thing ""the risks associated vaccination"" results sounds anti-vax. sounds like might much case first vaccines good, testing process designed test reduction symptoms, reduction actual infection (sterilising immunity).

But predict every country vaccine massively reduces hospitalisations deaths, political push end massively reduce restrictions. UK nearly removed restrictions summer even without vaccine (the speed amount mistake hindsight although level still good idea). problem virus political least be.

Viruses care politics. can't ""wrong politics"" one, wrong virus. CAKE LIE saying necessarily applies scientists quoted article, scientists vested interest keeping pandemic going.  Fucking assholes. friend died back May covid. 24 worked every day. Dude got Keto.

Also wife disease ruined liver spleen given effects leukemia (pancytopenia, low neutrophil numbers). super high risk covid.

So please, tell house meteors. Yea might one dumbest ideas I’ve seen app lol. grew county less 8,000 people. sheriff makes pittance. already money support would even consider running. high poverty area, leads tiny pool potential candidates. Hahaha really though, losers winners eat them. delpeted exhausted staff become vunerable making mistakes, catching covid severe symptoms someone well rested. past couple months I've heard people scrambling get certain COVID 19 test needed order board place go somewhere. pay attention going anywhere . . . . assumed (wrongly guess) airlines enforcing this. government always hoped people would isolate things got bad enough 

Except people don't. Cases deaths quite concentrated. rest community know hits everyone community. It’s protecting protect others. think surgeons wear masks performing surgeries....
To pass bacteria,viruses, etc. patient. 

Masks prevent spreading virus. 

It’s like wearing pants, keep yourself.


I don’t know much clearer need be. Wow...America wtf used ""party country"", literally ""party everything"". People literally willing let others die keep party control. arleady knew Charles it. still quarantine... see statistically valid data, can’t say all. actually mathematical tests tell difference data “significant” (not caused random chance), need wait data confirm hunches roll vaccine population. 

The consequences muddling along another weeks much lower consequences rolling ineffective vaccine.

We’re moving fast possible, can’t expedite past getting accurate data probably shows vaccine works early indications promising. That’s good way discourage people getting tested reminds Missouri repealed law saying wear helmet motorcycle. Pretty awesome seeing bikes fly highway 75 person helmet on. May god protect better science created helmet away with. Haha dude! It’s like came head. Jesus Christ. vast majority suffering Wisconsin country general traced back small handful people government. 

What’s amazing they’ll almost certainly never face consequences. Yes. Lol Also, didnt fuckheads driving US Alaska reality fucking roadtrip/holiday. Imagine type person wishes bad things happen others validate argument. co2 sci-fi future

Trees. It’s planting trees. Trees literally suck C02 atmosphere store it. sci-if future needed all. It’s trees. remember posting back April long term complications may end bigger story fatalities/fatality rate. good discussions unnerving genetic high blood pressure (well managed) wife factor V gene mutation (significant clotting risk). blood specialist said immediately call office contracts covid significant risks monitor. wont go detail scary AF. recently found ankle injury serious blood clot bedridden 3 weeks. 100s 1000s people around world undiagnosed factor V high risk clotting, pulmonary embolism, stroke covid. 

One closest friends got covid back May. Mild case, pneumonia, hospital stay. month recovery getting dizzy reason. Sure enough, low oxygen ground glass opacity lungs. He's underwater boat mechanic temporarily lost dive clearance July. Recent tests show basically little improvement. conversation switched potential permanent loss clearance livelihood.... awful. 

I get fookin mad ""99.9% survive! Open country go back normal!"" posters. alarming number people end problems last far longer covid itself. something downplay ignore. big damn deal. can’t believe many parties last night. Curious see there’s massive spike this. guess I've never seen sheriffs sign car except highway. know went Nevada, sheriffs per county like.... 5. Maybe el paso different.... good luck enforcing without police. 

If know... many sheriffs have? Well, put *that* way... no. believe take scenes like sink general population it’s real serious. realisation hospitals full loved one cannot treated even though normal circumstances would treated would survive. 

But scientists never allow get stage (and rightly so) easy dismiss hoax. It’s depressing. 

And again, saw images hospitals China Italy beginning still wasn’t enough convince hoaxers. Maybe we’re doomed. accept man apologizing Bullshit - park known parties. police step assert presence know it’s tine go home - fuck media

Edit: wasn’t obvious- cops break “party” every weekend last twenty years time nearly everyone wearing masks responsible Says Rudy cousin/wife People understand basic math. Things like deaths lag case increases 3-4 weeks, hospitals getting overrun means normal emergencies get triaged lower (leading deaths), etc.

""It is."" We're going find Tuesday country going use learning experience, potentially end modern era. Even former, we're still going very, long 3 months. doubt going let American tourists (or European) good long while. April nothing. yet take full brunt virus shown able handle it.  9 months going NOTHING done address it. doubt hundreds sexy nurses doctors there. summer i've read HIV really infectious first months infection. goes remission viral load really low body beat it.

&amp;#x200B;

wasn't confirmed fact article COVID viral load discussed HIV infection rates dropped years true let's requires 80% inoculation rate. half Americans already claimed take vaccine available. think understand you’re getting at, choice words bothers me. I’m US, 10% COVID deaths US far ages 35-54. 23% deaths 55-64 age bracket. That’s 33% COVID deaths coming people productive years. 

At 55 ain’t young ain’t old either, like people brackets, family depending rather way around. risk death causes gone least 10% year thanks disease. retail grocery worker I’m especially exposed it. feels pretty real me, (when) contract it, risk death pretty real too. 

By way, I’m relying CDC statistics count deaths positively identified COVID-19-related. Since deaths causes substantially higher beyond that, risk death realistically 10% too. 

So maybe could say “predominantly” “of greatest risk to” something like that, instead “really”? Every one deaths real someone matter age. mean? cant wait shit over.


ive never hated people pandemic technically flu pandemic every year burn restaurants nah Erie County (Buffalo, NY) sheriff department absolutely worse local cops. sheriff literally said resisted bodycams would give public wrong idea. Yeah, truth rot goes deeper presidency. There's entire news network, bunch theoretically independent legislators governors party chose enable every turn. you. one deserves kind power. Pretty soon going epidemic everyone else gotten control worth, alone. (Heh, pun). Lots us best slow spread end pandemic sooner rather later. appears challenge people go want, make excuses needs fun, normalcy, socializing prioritized greater good. guess reading people like us makes squirm bit. keep keeping on. finally over, know part solution. Happy cake day say gonna vote lol.... moron know trump family new Kennedys rep. know run. 

&amp;#x200B;

He name recognition (which equivalent intelligence average voter), plus already said going run .... smiled. America that's surest way know going run. Keep post next 4 years. I'll back rub in.....  nit picky, specifically said 50 came back ""under 65"" statistic. would imagine insignificant chunk ""20% covid deaths 65"" going upper end spectrum 50-65 range. understand doomscrolling sub I'll probably get downvoted this, try consistent stats please? cares? families 231,000 people died? Right live without parties especially ongoing pandemic. wear mask??? Yeah good problems.

1. everyone sensetive are. Infection chance high others dont wear mask.
2. Even Everyone wear mask, still small chance infection.

Its best activities ongoing pandemic. end world. welcome come dislike leader much dislike yours. Seriously. People aren’t going quarantine forever, don’t know headline. agree it’s bad can’t expect people isolate long. 1000 people much though. call Shirley. President Trump showed basic persistence, good attitude, roughly $5 million cutting-edge medical care, anyone make COVID.

I really see people making big deal this... near St. Louis love people say ever change.  horror March April nothing compared coming. Utah day. Every cell phone  too! Flu shot always effective flu mutates rapidly. Covid hasn't. Yet.  Yeah. regional data seems vary highly.

Applying 200-300k deaths 0.4-1.5% IFR may best way get range. it'll really wide one. Assuming thorough spread disease across US herd immunity reached 70% infected, assuming disease 0.7% average IFR per CDC, enough people dying people know someone died. Spanish flu killed somewhere 50 100 million people time Earth's population 2 billion. Covid might kill 3 million pessimistic scenario. Adjusted population today, Spanish Flu would kill 200-400 million. IOW, orders magnitude dangerous this. flu, coronavirus. They're really comparable. shops eateries brought fitbit last year. compatible windows 10 compatible android phone had.

Yeesh. hear much covid. They're charge, mayors.

And apparently they're good making critical decisions. I’m sorry you’ve isolate long. many people same. You’re trying bit, take responsibility societal level. perspective New Zealander, that’s right thing do. Yeah dude deserves break glass whiskey. Russia invades US brains, never needs gun. Bars still open. People still hosting weddings, trick treating, going dinner friends, we've got hunting season Thanksgiving right around corner.

god damn it. what? gonna get bad... known long time vitamin regulates interacts many parts immune system.  known long time vitamin deficiency makes individuals vulnerable numerous diseases. 

Here another survey, supports many conclusions: thing notice articles is, large number citations. Almost every sentence supported specific on-point research findings.

The surprising part is, many people continue claim important role vitamin human immune system established. firmly established decade ago. let young people die made couple bad decisions (which young people do)? You’re sick that. Well weren’t supposed fucking elect him. flu season somewhat predictable, would 6 weeks worst it

But I'm sure that's much inconvenience 🙄

Flu terrible. kills tens thousands year US, causes stress, pain, loss productivity individuals caregivers (in case children elderly.) able try masking flu, since literally costs thing pretty much effort. hope people stop freaking masks, realise cultural get it- least wear one they're sick winter. must payroll! China puppy! China knew, knew. give fines like there’s tomorrow. like show don’t understanding saying.

Good try though  wrong. sufficiently large percentage workers supply chain become sick (or call out) time, create immediate shortages particularly food deserts harder reach communities. hope every state experiences enough different trajectory limit this. Using vital signs measure health exactly novel idea medicine. 120 resting heart rate concerning though.  I’m starting wonder I’m crazy one thinking there’s still pandemic going on?  coinciding lot hysteria Q shite, already leading violence... Nothing happen guys. showed party, commit felony. Yes dare older people access healthcare anyone else. Proof Royals *really* want know anything, done Governments lose ton influence power financing. lockdown completely counterproductive that.

If government wants keep power, best interest keep lockdowns short possible. Thanks speaking actual facts government put money would likely dwarf Gates Foundation.  bet added up, us put close 10 Billion.  sure look get total. academic debate. knowing. Trump learned Xi airborne China resources take airborne procausions even hint airborne transmission. rest world anywhere near kind resources capacity required jump conclusions like that. Lol according who? Citation needed potatoe friend 

Because actual science says completely wrong? Sick Home Alabama! someone rich buy 30 second ads showing rows paralyzed intubated COVID patients. Might us good. Enforced who? NY can't impose rule airline aware FAA rule Nope. Folks local newspaper's Facebook still going ""lockdowns work respiratory viruses"" today. Yes. NY partiers definitely scream ""redneck"" me. thinks COVID-19 go away vaccine

I think people expecting go away. lowering something manageable like flu realistic expectation allow us get back normal. one blaming America pandemic. Americans responsible actions control spread within country however far handled well. find worse examples planet, number. 

Is really surprising people disappointed? *should* better developing nations. setting example rest world. We're failing total embarrassment. Americans love think highly we've good cause it, stings sharply watch us decline example hard watch worst qualities full display biting us ass time, like shooting us repeatedly face. Folks getting bitter. people stop caring go lives.

a vaccine made eventually, whole year becomes textbook example handle pandemic one- even Australians- gets without mandatory 2 weeks quarantine hotel expense. There's definite sacrifice battling thing hard pressed find someone (without tinfoil hat) thinks worth it.   There's plenty *supporting* evidence. CDC think convincing enough, current guidance people wear masks.

It would pretty hard conclusive evidence can't actually control variables. sheer number studies reach conclusions offset many concerns. masks help all, studies would different results ended with.

Edit: Danish paper, discuss rejected, can't say journals rejected it. Lots papers get rejected, I'm sure there's reason it. right people claim political. authors outright refuse discuss find someone publish it. read it, one say justified not, really help point either. perfect world.. seriously from? ever seen single cop gather group 40 individuals 

""Hey all, line up, give ticket.""

(Evwryones reaction)
""Okay!"" Scott Atlas Great Barrington people say herd immunity reached 10 20 percent. Morons...  I’d ignore it, since it’s stupid fucking question ignores possible negative outcomes COVID infection. Funny understand 😂 mentioned article, actually pretty reasonable choice. antigen less accurate PCR, suggest people treat positive antigen ""probable 100% guaranteed"" states would hope positive antigen result would also get PCR guidance probably well published need chillinois I'm Chicago conversation virus day said, ""well, hates us.""

I actually surprised sounded coming mouth. *He hates us.* Like, actually hopes suffer look bad support him. disliked presidents never felt actively hated one, like would want see us badly sick sense revenge. 

I'm used caring us. another level. actually sees us *enemy* terrifying. Hostile. Id rather die COVID wear mask vaccinated lmao what? enough information know strong possibility, rather warn people error side caution, played risk.  Username checks out! Lol

Endurance athlete? Alabama possibly fatigued about? don’t understand. Yes, everything fault lockdown /s care.. long care left give them. need back line behind everyone forced exposed covid opt voluntarily. Healthcare workers, first responders, essential workers, people infected performing actions necessary live (grocery shopping, masked up, distancing), etc. daily new cases well. understand everyone complaining Trump saying actually pretty accurate.

In country always less nee cases weekends simply test less. think takes long. need breathe droplets left hanging air.  Yeah hospital converted another unit keep going up, going end using field hospital parking garage.

Meanwhile family home state getting together Halloween acting like nothing wrong.

It. Makes. Me. Want. To. Scream. Good, time lack leadership strained society much people getting tired. social distance long right first time. physics different types stresses like stress stretching object pushing object. stress strain long enough object break. tested. pulled pushed far long next 3 week see frightening rise deaths. Thank you. can’t believe I’m getting downvoted common sense. fact people think rapists murderers deserve life teenagers trying good time deserve death blows mind. think girlfriend got from? Wait! thought *not* getting paid covid claims. non-sheep can't keep conflicting truths straight. Outside cities business like usual. Parties, bar crawls, weddings, masks etc.. Ugh. 
I'm Australia I'm stressed country week. Please everything safe... Covid random 'patriot' gun. receive taser shocks til flipping ""no nut November"" card Ones raised priority individual say whatever want, bad things happen others, happen you, fault fault someone else. 

Ones raised empathy suffering others taught track consequences actions action.

Ones ... 

Ah forget it, I'm going bed Thank you. Best wishes “the talk.” Tell what’s pressing mind, first. hear said plainly. I’ve considered wearing mask bed. time I’m like whatevs sleeping alone, need rest peace anyway. we're still Quarantine imposed lockdowns dont want admit wrong continue make problem worse people think enforcing pandemic rules tantamount fascist police state argue it’s people whatever want.. sigh WSJ gives certain number articles read. hit limit, way get beyond box asks choose subscription. limit reset, even clear cookies browsing history. yet. That's state plans were... costs would higher dragged much longer hadn’t happened. one saying cost this, acting would far worse. You’re trolling right? think China liberal hive mind? None places subject US Constitution. weird definition freedom case everywhere else.  hilariously pointless security theatre. I'm amazed police even complying point Im guessing hard people sit chill others get social. everyone treated equally. Seems triage irresponsible person better outcome would treated 65+ year old health issues.

How would determined someone wearing mask? patients family asked healthcare workers trust them? take time schedule view social media proof they're anti-mask? private business testing , docters offices private. Exactly. Workplaces schools still get pertussis/whooping cough outbreaks despite vaccinations. Happened middle school. got even though vaccinated... bad compared illness without vaccine Lmao no, that's like saying either trump lose win, 50/50 Chicagoan here. got tested last week tested negative, part drive % down. You’re welcome. def get it. sides bad Yeah, that's true :(. go bars private parties, bit disappointing walk Clark Street Wrigleyville. hospital space available that's one thing, someone else needs ventilator, fuck em. think anti-mask assholes get treatment. someone shed light matter? I'm supposed travel roundtrip NYC Los Angeles weekend. leave Friday evening return Sunday morning (total trip 36 hours). time Saturday get tested LA. get tested Thursday Friday NYC, okay let back NYC Sunday? Like, far ""you need test negative arriving NYC"" part goes - enforcing this? airline board flight confirms tested? enforced arrive NYC? Oy Basically version Voice America.   responsible first place.  science, deals peer reviewed data, argument authority. 

All answers 0% 100% false.

(Until time peer review, fairly sure) others words saying US new cases high testing way people including ones minor symptoms all? hoax hospitals getting full enough ICUs? explain deaths New York beginning pandemic? broad way music, refrigerator truck full corpses, corpses corridors hospital?
do really live bubble believe one tells lies? people like statements, end anytime soon. second wave come first come end never said either things. takes someone average intelligence know incorrect.

For starters, characterize clinical care COVID-19 throwing darts pretty insulting profession medicine. contagious pneumonia ctyokine storm, something know treat. treatment educated guess. Maybe know exactly coagulopathy, covid toes, people showed symptoms SpO2's 68%, lot ancillary. 

It factually, provably incorrect say localized. we’re fucked Exactly, there's much attitude ""if X get covid"" subreddit, ""if X chance getting COVID even higher chance riskier."" need think terms us risk getting it, there's automatic guarantee attached spreading. 5 8 states/territories lost jobs Victoria recent reporting period, 19 September - 3 October.

Covid damage?? I’m doctors evaluate. OB stretching head. wondering anyone else experiencing this? contact multiple covid patients, viral load higher.

Also, doctors know treat first. putting lot people ventilators, creates new set problems. they're quick ventilate, treatments seem work. i’ve wondering midwestern states. seems like every state go hell order take seriously (even florida people wear masks pretty well now) look table patient data end, people get influenza vaccines comorbidities associated serious covid infections lower rate (e.g. lower prevalence obesity, hypertension, etc.). valid say people cognicent getting flu vaccine likely things good health. believe paper recently published linked many cases rallies also I’m sure would quantify it...the people attending rallies people aren’t wearing masks social distancing outside rally so🤷‍♂️ helped admit patient ICU ER last week started okay, noticeably getting worse throughout shift. put strong face, hard see afraid really was. best help keep spirits night even though knew headed. returned ICU days later intubated sedated. still know she'll live not. watched another Covid patient spend long time intubated wanted die rather remain intubated. family let (because effects long term sedation consciousness, family often become decision makers situations). eventually died prolonged life beyond wanted.

ICUs surreal places, particularly nonhealthcare workers, even noncovid times. Covid, least me, put overdrive. Well fuck too, asshole. like week trump wins, people wont care live life normal again

Y'all stupid can't see politics lol hope get smoothly possible. selfishness, obsession individual freedom's expense public good.

I imagine sort legislation would met civil suits people would decry draconian though. falsely speak there's trade-off.

lmao Constructive criticism needed. People different views.  makes us human.  

But asinine language rhetoric federal leadership made people disbelieve science scientists even worse made health well public political issue. live part Australia case since March, due aggressive containment quarantine. needed wear mask once. even one. There's upside taking seriously. People prolonging virus parts world want sacrifice anything short term prevent spready live free it. decisions consequences.  Wear mask dipshit realize

Healthline ran doctors put sound medical information reporting. “doom porn”. Sorry don’t like cold facts Coroner: many suicides today

Me: wonder might future issues, since tough times?

You: NO! coroner said “everything fiiiiine right now” believe Science ™️ Yes, I’m getting lot “you’re problem” I’m nuancing opinion. 

It general statement, aimed you. 

I agree see people summer long outdoors, day. christakis (same guy) writing vaccine probably widely deployed U.S. achieves herd immunity—a level infection population, roughly 40% SARS-CoV-2, limits epidemic potential pathogen. likely reach point 2022 matter do. clear, however, vaccines would still enormously valuable protect uninfected people even way, good vaccine without one, Americans live acutely changed world 2022—wearing masks, avoiding crowded places limiting travel, least wish avoid getting spreading virus. immediate pandemic period.For time reach either herd immunity widely distributed vaccine, people still recovering overall clinical, psychological, social economic shock pandemic adjustments required, likely 2024. lingering response, typical past serious epidemics, demarcate intermediate period. Then, gradually, things return “normal,” albeit world persistent changes. Around 2024, post-pandemic period begin.


you read unpaywalled



the late 2021-early 2022 period consistent people like fauci said. christakis seems talking sociological side people take heed virus go without fear. group people gets smaller every day pandemic fatigue. like said, americans (anyone really) fortitude stay inside till 2024. getting downvoted *reddit* saying that, users site probably less social average. likelihood able go restaurant safely 2022, maybe without pandemic sitting back mind 2024 That's works lmao bad week stop sniffin glue.


I think every week good week stop sniffing glue point even masks. Physical distancing absolutely essential. smart would number system enter store like that, allowed time, etc. Suffice say that's pipe dream. get trying clever, hold times played sports feet, rather horse. Hence rugby also called football.

Not mention original American football ball fact, picked up, kicked among things. iirc even round too? basically, blame college dudes late 1800s problem name. Papa football Mama rugby baby gridiron, took fathers name. really big deal. first one looking samples serious Covid patients course going see poor immune response associated worse disease. 

Read paper. looked GC responses convalescent (asymptomatic), severe intermediate, severe high disease patients. convalescent group, still patients similar GC defects. individuals fall category people I've talking second one says memory B cells important factor immunity virus. 

Look actual data. headline. low decreasing levels IgM class switched memory B cells 3 months follow-up decent number patients. 

This distinguishes us PhDs armchair amateurs. actually dig data rather read headlines. Also, reported harassment. Coronavirus... finds way. Oh let’s forget visiting elderly parents old school buddies Thanksgiving! Woohoo! Spread virus wide far reply right person? agreeing you. Ya still takes work, 10 hrs day think paid? Maybe health experts saying needed get infection rate much lower heading winter we've done exact opposite. Maybe hospitals around country getting swamped patients, forced transfer patients states.

These things predicted exact people who've said gotten better treating virus. thing hospitals overwhelmed, enough beds staff available, people might lived medical treatment die.

My question you, people downplaying start? fighting rational action day 1? know chief coroner. got it. Reddit: Japan low covid positive tests wear masks

Also Reddit: Americans can’t go outside can’t trusted wear masks

People think something objective reality actually cultural preference. wakeup call we'd need like climate change likely ignore instead... Nobody expects perfect vaccine. one lets us go back normal. Aye aye I’m Scoob! could call arrogance would say it’s inevitable (and arrogance too, mean come on, mass event?!). Trying stop people desired behavior long something usually works well matter right society. That’s adopted education less severe limitations many risky behaviors, even though safest path.

*Which reason initial, effective lockdown important (or follow one, whatever gets low enough actually trace, quarantine follow).*

Now we’re left trying convince people follow restrictions month month get worn out, run programs resources offset impact, see others following anyways (this report silly mass Halloween gathering all). sorry loss Spiraling around black hole. conversation phone friend long ago. saying need isolate vulnerable rest us go business. told that's fucking plan...she agreed. take qualified individual ascertain case loads exceed hospital's capacity individuals would've survived medical intervention die due lack treatment increasing proportion individuals die disease. explain alternative?

Ie, logical well thought policy. warm weather coming Australia? Coincidence?  mean I’m sure it’s still circulating seeing everyone celebrating without social distancing many wearing (mandatory) masks making little anxious. Fingers firmly crossed though! hilarious thing kick refuse sign CDC order completely fucked either gets covid19 try help out.  may well end homeless themselves. That’s bad citizenship I've seen projections economies probably recover around then, think things feel pretty normal then. Though would, personally, love see positive shift constitutes normal. Though current people charge, likely deny treatment BLM protesters. [Oh, [I  distance mean constant lockdown closures 

I mean guess feels good knock strawman really accomplish much.  Good point. lot sports this. Samsung pay me. always forget though. Definitely worth trying remember though!  review studies, found conclusive evidence, American CDC.

But find curious case, Danish study got rejected three different journals content. sound scientific? Evidence narrative suppressed?  agree sentiment far tourists... Hong Kong Thailand widely visited destinations planet. defeating virus largely due mask adherance good public policy. today  realize majority vaccine's developed American companies? sound like idiot. vaccination record covid-19 Americans requirement future, similar yellow fever vaccination currently parts world. ebola country, trust scientists

But yea, I'm going parks cafes, Europe US going horrific waves, I'm definitely feeling sense victory pride. fucking it. Sure, aren’t yet. Closing bars restaurants lockdown. Yup, op describing advertising overlay us seeing. Covid flu bro. Covid weak can't even kill people severely inbred genetics. think found takes longer show up.

In even sort high risk group, fit &amp; sporty thirties. I'm me, I'm people's parents grandparents ❤️❤️ Well replying comment UK. also highly doubt US 15% population infected, kind infection rate observed absolutely massive outbreaks regional tge US. It’s simply unnecessary whose jobs, therefore lives, depend dining What’s interesting America outbreaks localized, mostly rural areas fewer people. Urban area mask compliance restrictions gatherings US broadly comparable Europe, better; worst outbreaks right places like North Dakota, South Dakota Montana population density lower.

Because US never fully beat first wave, many people cities stayed home constantly last months, leaving shop/obtain takeaway/seek medical care/see small groups close relatives. all, enough make serious impact viral spread. such, better positioned second wave’s arrival hadn’t fully resumed public gatherings dining like Europe has.

The US also much south average, winter arrives later here. expect huge surge month southern states begin forced indoors dining.

Tl;dr Americans irresponsible, actually careful average European August/September Lol doesn’t. many Darwin Award nominees year lol, nice Murdoch rags willing Victoria fail. Utterly ghastly. even said administration ended pandemic Since words short, works multiple ways. tend accent strictness internal words— true across languages, although policies vary quite bit— one-syllable words tend work stressed unstressed practice... whereas say word like ""indifferent"" /ɪn.'dɪf.rənt/ accent first last syllable, sound like never heard word before.

If we're strict allowing vowels /ɪ/ /ə/ considered unstressed, get almost described, 3rd syllable stressed, vowel sequence is: \[**aɪ**, ɪ, **aɪ**, **i**, ɪ, **aɪ**, ə, **oʊ**, ə\]. English tends allow monosyllabic words hermaphroditic regard stress level, also communicated vowel duration tends flexible.

For example, standing alone two syllables, ""poem"" typically pronounced stronger longer first syllable: /p**oʊ.**əm/. still understandable sound wrong (a quarter beat shorter) /po.əm/. 0 also number. shows impact. Thankfully Dallas seems pretty board. getting along roommates suck. ""can't"" evicted long provide landlord declaration form CDC website. need roommates signatures end district court judge likely decide fate (if say true probably fine). least Trump got eviction ban moratorium right. woods yet like chances going forward. 
must remain vigilant! There's evidence masks *don't* work.

&amp;#x200B;

^(And lots evidence masks work.) really can’t wrap mind around it. It’s handled expected handled. Everyone wants kids schools disrupting education, administration creates waves changes schools following different federal protocols every years. states. need money politics schools. Fully fund equally. see plays out. 

We also need move work home society IMO. Sure, certain jobs can’t done home, there’s slew aren’t power control. Reality is... shown real numbers, would choice lock weeks ago.

Less public knows, keep train chugging! People die time. people going die poverty, depression missed illnesses/delayed diagnoses covid. What, saying lock everything virus result deaths typical flu? where’s FEMA this?  military hospitals?  embarrassed man wished people empathetic community :( Right! felt like many friends family knew bum deal, else could it?

The problem young people getting together parties isn’t going away get worse weather gets colder. Bro you’re man. pretty sure many others taking streets summer protest ridiculousness- sound like quiet acceptance also hard locked inside due stay home orders

i think we'd love see fact-based discourse everywhere else, unfortunately requires pretty sweeping discussions role media abroad serve Give break. Science magic. said know. There's nothing wrong demanding evidence. lot people think big one... least never know.   deception? Liberty safety. urbanised populations urbanised matter Wat abt Sweden then? But... Trump rally thousands supporters? legal? Fine me. formally agree waive right treatment whatsoever, please resume normal life, highness? Second! sometimes wish put effort campaign PA, WI MI.  came close hospitalized last year. antibiotics worked would been. can't imagine coronovirus, stupid expose willingly. what's point keeping private?? Yes, that’s exactly works lives line Thank responsible quarantining case. You’re decent person. Sounds like girl trying responsible too. feel like many people would assume fine go daily life. seems right looking really sweet plague doctor masks online, bad don’t money waste there’s point pandemic. I‘d say it’s pretty small, states own, unfortunately. morons Yeah might well give sadly. mean victoria australia? Australia island one goverment. Completly different europe. Lol, stay fuck home, then. geography help? place practically close internal borders political there.  talking bar stars exist get absolutely shitfaced weekend

How interesting painted everyone article way. feeling personally attacked? 

Nah kinda hate going bars honestly, congrats power deduction.  true,nowadays money power life unfortunately rich always survive Sealing vents? Wtf waaaay much overreaction. Youre living terror lol 400 deaths day country 85 million tough even imagine. People generally compliant first month two, quarantining beyond half year, close year, end sight? gonna happen. unrealistic frankly illogical. economic mental health damages alone going enormous. Maybe dealing actual terrifying disease, glorified flu. buddies miss smile laughter. Get see-through mask lasts long. Oh daddy yeah lick boot! literally never want know Downtown Orlando looks like used spend time there. Yup. significant majority restrictions place world theatrics political maneuverings  grow up? one bringing level. Measles? Small pox? lethal contagious. American, confirm selfish fuckers. Makes sad embarrassed. talk people without party 500 people.

For fuck's sake. See that's get. People talk governments (around world might add) using ""scamdemic"" exert even power people.

In reality, putting restrictions help government all. Restricting number people inside stores restaurants? Less tax dollars government. Lockdowns? Yeah, pretty much tax dollars coming in. Mask mandates? know half people refuse even put one on. Closing borders put huge strain supply chains course destroys tourism hospitality industry, huge money maker many governments around world. decreased movement people also means less revenue energy usage.

I might add western countries massive amount national debt already even pandemic. What's benefit governments impose restrictions? Grow up. 80% people get coronavirus wearing masks still get it. dont spread fake news guy lot fun things NYC Halloween don’t involve needing in, lot kick ass things do. It’s win/win either way.  Yeah theres quite big difference partying handful people thousand lol. chill friends u need to. Early pandemic March, man tested positive fighting quarantine order Kentucky governor local authorities forced stay home. can’t remember exact details, back governor treated like hero it. feel like people would flip shit, even though it’s exact thing. It’s like people listened much conservative rhetoric living fear virus like flu. It’s stupid really. knows happen New York party people come contact with. one weekly thread, essentially YouTube spam another anecdote.

yawn.

&amp;#x200B;

once again, covid isnt deadly disease spreads asymptomatically mandate state pay balance within six months end date. June pay Hey man there's us there. done shit go work wearing mask outdoor distanced activities. Hopefully stay safe neighbor. Best happen January? many projected deaths worldwide per day? I'm concerned world. finally going Summer, rough Winter. Hope vaccine released soon possible. worry stuck back head? 

alcohol

and also sick authority figures et al telling this. basic young adult rebellious shit Yup. 

Everyone talks rest world social distancing/quarantines/shut downs ""wrong"", matter extreme government things. comment reply random statement? learn live it, going away tried find job right actually living wage? partner worked bartender 15% bars restaurants closed city. ones opened slashed staffs nothing. tried get different job applied probably 150. even interview. Oh trust me, I've fighting COVID taken seriously office since area's mitigation restrictions went effect there's communicating malignant narcissist gets information Fox News. seem mostly relates heart sympathetic nervous system. biggest thing heart rate jump orthostatic changes, similar POTS. instance, showering hit heart rate 170 (before diagnosed medicated). also get hand tremors slight provocations little minor things like blood pooling feet stand extremities going cold pale. diagnosed particular dysautonomia, agreed seem sort especially relates heart. want know many people died, click updates week state drop menu.


Spoiler alert: 300,000 dead. studies showing anywhere 3x 20x case undercounting. doubt changed drastically time. get bounds sanity check way, doubt get anything accurate. driven southern Utah, mask adherence incredibly low (everywhere went except downtown Cedar City acceptable — didn’t go SLC imagine it’s ok there). Almost one walking around streets hiking trails wears masks. wonder cases spiking there. quite shocking compared random towns/hiking trails Nevada, California, Washington. Nope, point weighing pros cons going theme park love roller coasters much like “if go, catch corona, least I’ll ridden coasters die. don’t go, catch corona anyway, I’ll missed last chance.” remembered I’m idiot. That’s good comparison. F I'm pretty sure bronchitis March 3 weeks. bad enough - need developing another virus pneumonia worse time breathing already (I mostly fine sitting around day couch, honestly got fucking winded trying clear books bookshelf one day) Generally yes, catch it, contacts I'm know almost sure. long... Certain hospital New York 24 hours oxygen left rest oxygen supply went NICU/Pediatric Unit. used much oxygen delivery trucks couldn’t keep up. lot people died night. nurses called team transports morgue Grim Reaper every time showed someone passed away.


That may lead to. hospitals describe Rationing Care. making trolling obvious enough sub guess. vaccine distributed within 18 months something never expected. initial plan give 6 months start living life normally. Seeing quickly vaccine progressed able dig current set three vaccines already produced distributed. However get vaccine done pandemic. ""better"" vaccine years willing put life son's life hold long.  word advice: narcissists lie, like time, it’s like blood vampires. lie accomplishments, lie people sons, hire people lie them, incessantly. It’s do. sooner get wise narcissist, happier aren’t getting fooled anymore. 

And yeah, sucks realize nearly everything said lie, kind blows mind imagine another human this, sad fact lying form self preservation. It’s armor build layer layer can’t distinguish difference truth lie that’s lie convincingly. Likely fining (or even jailing) organizer. Everyone else gets told go fuck home. vibe saying mothers never get abortions life threatening situations, yeeted leftward sole purpose government serve people. can’t trust that, people need stop voting assholes power. much lack education country happen time soon, though. Nothing. I'm serious, call Shirley. head cdc says flu 5-10x deadlier covid-19 children Well, they've certainly looked past ""Love thy neighbor"" many cases, I'm sure they've figured morally flexible. Dammit. know. I'm teacher I'm hoping end stay home order city includes me, I'm scared dying. want kids lose parent. one hospital. Selfish? Yeah, kinda. want people unemployed though. Cases decided go back fall. known. Oh well, dammit... really isn’t much attitude. 

If anything everyone’s got way much laid back attitude comes virus. One per person basis per test basis. Essentially per person basis count someone once. essentially get surge harder keep lower due running people degree. comparison chart see two rates diverging probably keep getting apart. mom actually discussion manding masks vs helmets/seatbelts. REALLY upsets idiots wear masks impacts others' health. And, regarding others, like ""I really care. Feel bad family, crash highway spl*t road, really affect body"" know I'm pretty harsh, but, people think they're invincible. absolute definition /r/confidentlyincorrect worries want answer, dysautonomia like? feel may go compare Victoria's August numbers Europe. worth noting graph burial Jakarta.. data excess death Jakarta..
 
before pandemic, big portion death buried outside Jakarta, pandemic, could difficulties bury dead relatives outside Jakarta (hometown neighbouring city), especially death patient suspected covid (there cases death buried Covid designated graveyard Covid funeral protocol later turned negative)
 
for excess death data, actually weird first several month (march may) reported death way smaller previous months, point way less reported burials..
 
it supposed people held back reporting death relatives (for death certificate purpose) social distancing measures..
 
edit: 
another complication Moslem custom dead buried within 24 hours (unless foul play suspected) suspected patient dead result came out, buried using Covid protocol designated graveyard..
 
edit: trying denialist, putting context..  Well congratulations, reasonably healthy twenty something like reddit, even need vaccine meet expectation. Sweet source there, pal. Really - top notch. favorite color crayon? I'm guessing.... brown? Ha share this! Idiots Like ever table. people care partying Halloween certainly care gathering Thanksgiving/Christmas. 

Everyone else demanding full eradication virus would stayed home regardless idiots refuse wear masks, refuse quarantine infected think hoax. I’m freeloader! make rules too. everyone antisocial basement dweller like are. Ummmm.... india PHUCKED. Source: 2 indian coworkers significant # close relatives india (i’m states) interesting  wearing masks...you won't. Wait so. Y’all finally getting scared thing you’ve pushing may actually come fruition ?

Y’all pandering ages wanting normalize masks even post pandemic acting like hermits, someone half lot worship says it’s problem?

Maybe. maybe. stop acting like scared children, speak mind, fight back. 

FUCK narrative fuck new normal bullshit “great reset” posted source. response? Exactly. Certain politicians loved point Sweden early days country put mandates place; however, looked Swedes' behavior voluntarily compliant safety protocols need mandates. much less mistrust government health officials there. Fuck me. thought vaccine meant would never get disease. Apparently case one thinks guaranteed get around someone positive. Every medical professional would even Americans would it. 

The risk higher worth irresponsible. envy you, lot. CDC data longer public information. apologies using word “moron” 

It’s fair, especially someone realizes made mistake. already awful, going get worse. plans pay 5 months rent Due January 1st??? I've seen many John C videos since early March, long, yikes lol understand differences April November. may see mass graves take seriously.

Well right mortality still stable compared April, half back then.

The difference April, centered specific cities like New York. see far lower that, spread among states cities Covid hit.

Even intense localized springtime situation, New York hospitals managed, although things tough. dont think triage became issue? Succinctly said.  bad, taken account restrictions vary state. Ontario (Canada), recommended gather household. mistake misinterpretation! Absolutely not. That's saying. clearly trade trying control virus, balance needs found. reason South Asian countries value collectivism individualism done better virus, think West could look self-assessment. Nobody wants anybody welding people homes. 400 steps get that. think would helpful people lean heavily towards individualism spectrum sincerely consider if, example, mask mandate big intrusion lives welded homes. love dumb Americans, “pros” you’re trying point available lot countries negatives USA. 

Nice try though, drink kool aid, im sure it’ll help think US begin lockdown election Nov 3? dumbass said virus hoax, time believer Nibiru. friends hunt shacks stay days people. much hunting, camaraderie goes along it. flu eradicated evens things Hey, leaders working hard marketing campaign popularity contest 2 days! Real Star Lord. Y’all don’t even wanna know downtown Orlando looked like last night Yep, 6 people. 4 less maximum state permits. 

People allowed gather.

Edit: taking moron, fair mistake. Today ate outside cold really wanted Torchy's Tacos. Zero people patio still put corner one left right behind closest table front like 10 feet (it stayed empty, rest). first time ate restaurant since beginning March maybe even February. even fathom eating inside people wearing masks -- people care cram together drink?! Police stop party, write names. ID, plus call right away confirm number. keep list. Incase one gets infected, bam. Tracing. 

Plus citation. Fuck em. flu 5 deadlier currently is, known unilaterally effective widely accepted treatments, vaccine, could outdoor dining, take out, catering, curbside pickup, mitigation factors, guess would seasonal businesses. mean, it’s generally impossible precisely pin respiratory disease caught, unless community transmission small strictly monitored. Crazy steal public data collected government.... write paychecks? First disqualifying criteria social media posts partying mask wearing. grandmother die 30-40 year old asshat went Halloween party. Thank everyone kind words. Unfortunately grandpa listened president downplay virus taking precautions. indictment healthcare system pandemic response, although shit Lol What? Shat hasn’t made hate states. ive deal morons since born here. Nothing citizen country makes proud happy even organise underground party hundreds people show up? 
You can't hand flyers post Facebook.  constant drunken breath parties Garmin picks infections. sudden big rise resting heart rate month ago. took week running. husband got 24 hour fever week later. never got tested idea mild dose Covid.  miss? But, you. trying good time 

They're fucking selfish morons without empathy deserve sympathy. 

They well aware science now. believe science walk nearest cliff test whole 'gravity' thing. personally Instagram friends showing private closed party's. massive attendance, mask all. 

I hate snitches. knew location. I'll call cops them. wear mask 12 hours day, see nephew sad b.c halloween, plus limit exposure , forget holidays use go get wasted great night. Fuck you. want family alive. gathered people, gathering household pandemic don’t job yet carry disinfectant wipe stores, operate pin pad touch screens wipe, saves maybe helps next person Freedom fray, naw there's hefty fuckin' fay threshold changed 60% FDA's meeting 22nd ahh, recall plan said BMI. info comorbidities long ago. also remember whether active short period applies whole pandemic there.

in state update triage plan summer remove ""productive"" think word. whatever can't consider things like physical mental handicap, though age still factor course conditions might shorten life. something leaked? Shouldn’t public information? Right lmao. Redditors absolutely hilarious  forget flu spreading alongside COVID, someone gets doubt even hospital would save them, could easily see CFR get close 18%.

Agreed. think high CFR March/April may coinfections flu locked down. would also explain hard predict would end needing treatment. 


Last note, heard coronaviruses swap DNA one another situations, another reason keep spread limit repeated exposures. much, since halloween party wearing masks like should.   interfering ability get tested, harassing it, could run trouble, can't it? sound like paranoid nutcase lol keep rising afterwards Unfortunately result policy makers thinking states handle piecemeal rather putting weight nationally coordinated pandemic plan action. myopic best. Never better case full court press coordinated fully funded national response. Instead going completely overwhelmed bankrupt states. complete disaster either way coordinated federal response. federal government. handle problems big handled state level. Imagine war feds tell states need mount defense one one. thing. virus enemy. Absolutely retarded decision making. one would mistake administration visionary. Best bit brexit. see guy's smug face Brussels anymore. Farage's goal consistently wrong side history, remarkable success. CDC: [Hold hunting season

not sure outdoor, relatively solitary activity lots distancing going create case spikes *These* people police teargassing. think chance happening ? A) wear mask

B) don’t think it’s fucking cold

C) Don’t tell don’t fucking care I’m part that’s I’ve done since March.

Edit: I’m type person thought based nationality instead owning apologizing downvote walk away. Again, sincerely, fuck you. Chilling, mostly.

Why, wanna talk? Reminds dad. get cold it’s fault careful. gets cold it’s fault giving him. earth data hospitals showing full soft hypothetical? data deniers same. facts feelings.
Ps-they full absolutely bungled response pandemic. Smoking doesn’t always cause cancer seems like accurate statement me.  Even 50% effective, couldn’t provide protection 50% work perfectly for? flu vaccine always explained 100% effective. However doctor would say even wasn’t totally effective me, likely I’d partial response less severe case.

I hoping covid vaccine also works like that. 50% plus population works designed. large majority others helps prevent Covid severe. could still spread it, vaccinated you’ll likely survive mild case. found this. March September Jakarta reported 1731 covid deaths 11100 excess deaths. That's quite difference. cunt Maybe try week without news. glued phone torture impose ourselves. us follow international news even talk daily people around us (neighbor, cashiers etc). people can't even say hi back street, compassionate strangers different places can't even acknowledge another human street ? He's pheasant plucker  
he's pheasant plucker's son  
he plucks pheasants  
when pheasant pluckers gone. found this. March September Jakarta reported 1731 covid deaths 11100 excess deaths. That's quite difference.  I’m saying it’s guaranteed transferred person person you’re close someone whose positive. mean something, means exactly said. Lmao I'm talking socially drinking, i'm talking bar stars exist get absolutely shitfaced weekend. can't believe seriously 0 power deduction able figure out. feeling personally attacked? ain't packing least 16 people dining room, ain't celebrating!

/s aren’t vents left. Well way things going might always true. Americans? mean world? Cus America, close half population even take vaccine. Great sensational headline. matters happened last month, happening now.  midwest states getting lot new cases.  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa. different policies seem lots new cases. Please It’s we’re already spiking anyway, stupid isn’t helping things any. u/pixelprophet said '/s' 17 times.
Tag reply anyone mention ""u/scountbot u/{targetperson}"" anywhere want count many times they've said '/s' ! flu kill people too, anyone spreads flu get manslaughter charges too? Fucking schools restaurants dumb fucks sitting inside without masks perhaps? always post archive link Washington post articles post.

Here’s link Seriously. Nursing made hate people much. They’re horrible  United States. donate kidney go top list kidney transplant remaining kidney fails point. he’s working self interest. point original comment. He’s working everyone stations self interest exposing covid quick economic gain. again, it’s dumb hell. Maybe learn reading comprehension least better devils advocate. never suggested anywhere refuse safety net. given. you’re mixing two different discussions—economic survival civil rights false choice two. trying argue? age comorbidity woman helped? BORTLES!!! snark right? Mexicans want close border.  Ironic, holiday celebrated wearing masks one sight.  Hi there, already posted Reposts removed people dumb cases otherwise healthy 20 year olds dying it. norm still possibility.  cases doesnt mean deaths.

That exactly cases means exactly math works. Oh, gotcha. Came across justification (I can't tell anymore) incentive - Go back life pre C19. Private Orgs conglomerate. Imagine big companies affected Covid. Think Boeing/Airlines/AirBNB/Uber/Lyft/Pharmas/Hiltons/Marriot/Hyatt. companies solved unique problems big scale. It’s amazing elite human mind collaboration achieve. Lol trust live place daily shootings thing. know look for. comes covid. fuck knows. N yup. hate stiches lol
Oh wait... Hi there, already posted Reposts removed get vaccine done pandemic

I'm sure I'm inclined believe idea works I’m curious now. Please tell us. Cotton mask? better? agree 100% can’t force anyone right thing. recently moved back elderly parents dad cancer. course got back side country around mid February. parents work(ed) medical field fully understand dangerous virus is. asked mom morning Thanksgiving actually hoping would agree bad idea. sat silently answer questions realized case. said brother expected coming over. 54 year old brother, talking virus coming end time since April, bringing 6 year old vector him. I'm really worried this. correct. Flu vaccine 30% effective. need learn live COVID long term. Utah county Utah Utah, makes sense. Okay? He’s working self interest that’s point comment . doesn’t mean agree dunce. Learn reading comprehension Good responsible. know many people would never stand way shut something felt getting hand. Mah freedumbs! Civil rights non negotiable it’s okay force people poverty taking right survival away refusing offer safety net

I issue protests. issue rationalize protests civil rights wants government continue take away rights millions earn living survival themselves. aren’t crimes. friend posting videos raving nyc last night. Posting ig stories. mask sight. kinda want un-ask bridesmaid. Fuck her. Nerds false. speak german English. better translating German English way around. largest issue usually odd verbiage rather anything incomprehensible.

 I'm sure idea deep L better come from; however heard repeated recently friends speak English. theory similar stated people comparing memory Google translate many years ago now. Oh all. 1000 people party time like this. I'm offering perspective commentors first question. Durka durka What's crazy going months people totally complacent it. think want know bad actually impotent change it.

I hard time even putting words bad situation is. blatant lies. Honestly boggled. varies greatly. Pennsylvania sheriffs serve warrants aren’t even allowed make traffic stops. don’t even full police powers. comparisons made human behavior.

Obviously viruses differ. thinking he’s gang runner dumb. public servant dumb. putting others risk dumb. America dumb. Even though doesn’t make dumb. Look president. zero, mean zero evidence first claim. current evidence suggests latter. also apparently misunderstand strain is. change dna relatively rarely means change antigen structure. 

You misunderstand immunity means second. yea imagine attending protest even people Wow. wow. Civil rights non-negotiable. Full stop. love people think they're invincible.

We took every precaution still got it. idea where.  Police vote 80 percent trump. Trump says virus fine. makes total sense end country civil war kinda way yea, hope rioters link proof? breaking protests Getting alcohol poisoning weekly basis social drinking.

Social drinking 2 3 boys pub long work week going fuck home.

These people get absolutely wasted. social drinking, binge drinking. So....your solution what? nothing watch millions die? Well it’s the... stochastic nature events? example Fukushima Daiichi caused increased number extreme weather events caused global warming unpredictable intersections random events exacerbated climate change.

So climate change didn’t make virus may destroyed habitat took bat come city, live roof market, take shit pangolin whatever. increased probability event occurring occurrence event greatly increases probability happening again. Agreed. 18yo partying something like this. ain't stupid. truly understand seriousness covid, would consciously make excuses something irrational. awe...the next generation leaders...we're screwed Economic interests Include jobs put food peoples table. last checked still needed money pay rent,buy food, electricity. 

But making big deal. arguing civil rights supporting people’s livelihoods destroy ability survive Wrong! always wear masks, social distance etc. wash mail... groceries... 

I'm careful anyone know. got (my whole family). like wild fire.  cynical accurate hate Let em die, honestly less people better world, getting tired shit. totally justified feeling like that. shit situation. expressed principal/superintendent/whatever? serious situation got wonder going work worth feeling anxious 24/7 Honestly, despite death, might good thing long run. might finally lights fire asses rational Americans deal evangelicals anti-intellectuals. They've becoming bigger bigger problem every year. r/misanthropy you’d like commiseration. people speading COVID small gatherings, original spreader catch from? community. community cases already high, small gatherings definitely spread. Otherwise, gathering issue. would mean headed massive depression?? wash mail, groceries.... always wear mask... social distance... 

My whole family got it, idea where. Gas station... grocery store... 

I'm careful anyone know. Bive seen people walk around gloves... that, thats it. “we’ll back 1918 standards care worse.” That’s beyond absurd, certainly needs sort evidence support it. excuse. Mexico one nations bad, probably even worse US terms managing pandemic. leadership likely terrible. So, economic interests important civil right?  glad live New York. terrible police state. herd immunity baby Honestly, think lot New Yorkers fed obeying rules everything supposed months, watch rest country give shit continue live lives they're taking chances now. sad, longer goes on, going see. agree 100% this. let us prepare downvoted oblivion ""being racist"". get free tests throughout lot new york... Say again. fan tall poppies you? 

It's late change; heading miserable existence think it’s like English language propaganda boosted Russian botnets leaking English (and German/Spanish) speaking world. 10 months, people afford care take airtight precautions middle class above. 

Working people - “get fucked” Probably y'all's liberal brethren, slap em wrist. keep breaking cultures societies subcultures reach individual level, still overall tendencies. fuck-you-got-mine individualism present greater degree US probably country. ""Human beings disease, cancer planet, plague, cure.""

Agent Smith wise, er, program Made China, Distributed USA. Welp, going long 2021... isnt 2022, I'm going turn antimasker, point living like rest life rest friends partying fun. exactly didn’t want risk trick treating year. knew could run one groups. candy stations found driving around neighborhood even homeowners sitting right beside maskless, totally defeating purpose. found three safe enough grab candy. Sorry, suggesting nothing else matters besides covid? everyone sociopathic this? fear? genuinely want know. world lost damn mind, yet seems pretend caring...but refuse discuss anything covid. breaks heart see unwilling people discussions. expect leaders better?! Look general population. Sheesh let keep partying Reopening needs happen months, weeks. system also needs place deal small outbreaks without using lockdowns.  K everyone basic empathy people could kill running around like little plague rats.  Yeah NHC report give detail SARs shame. I'm aware daily cases Hong Kong imported. Florida it’s world. +1 Don’t pretend source would good enough skeptic like that’s already made mind mean think he'll care future lot harder kids good Halloween memories Halloween became orphan. Someone still buy product. Manufacturing down, less goods bought. moment beginning pandemic raw oil negative price. Meaning oil companies pay someone store oil. rookie numbers! US better position:

1) Theres hard evidence supporting 15% number would around 50 million people US almost 9 million currently reported. Almost certainly 9 million reported, extent doesnt appear publicly available, peoples guesses.

15% even true wouldnt good thing, better thats even looking Herd Immunity, likely thing either virus mutate like common cold coronavirus.

2) US isnt needs mitigate going get worse. Extremely misleading headline. Yes. term strain gets thrown around lot, probably two strains. D614G seems stable spike turn might make infectious thus different strain.

This first flagged potentially new strain sequence alone mutation spike. go well evidence? 

Can elaborate post source? really. Ey friend slovak beautiful language Nope! think it’s fun whatever do. Even riding subway people watching awesome. would wait year Village Halloween parade (hopefully next year). It’s thing everybody experience life Must grocery store. 

Good luck. probably everything right still got unlucky. least managed delay it, though -- they've gotten better treating it, diligence pay little least, right? anybody know frequently tests yield false positives and/or false negatives? curious kind margins we’re lookin local hospital nearing capacity covid patients. full many postponed appointments/ procedures lockdown hospital sat empty. backlog plus going cold/flu season. seriously, what's gonna next? enough damage already many people know died heroine? Shall make free all? think goalposts moved black hole point. Still, heart good see people sub scared. handle fame? pandemic specific definition neglecting. Stay home possible  Hey goalposts...where at? Ok virus less likely kill bigger side effects Florida journey, destination change administration make restrictions stronger, lot us want. treated properly beginning, could've free now. anyone else learn name Tedros seeing face news since March? Greece deserves mention. cancelling carnivals 1 reported infection back February. January Greeks predicted pandemic planned accordingly: quarantine periods foreign travelers, limited access care homes, events cancelled on.

Meanwhile England everything carrying normal 700 people hospitalised daily basis, including untold numbers people stepping flights Milan, time serious problem virus, checks whatsoever.

It's absolute disaster 'round. walk 'round country July eyes open anyone semi-functioning reasoning capacity would predicted we're seeing now. 'Same continental European countries. remember watching Belgium opened things again, 'could around end June, stood top one another, close enough work next person breakfast day: clearly thought safe wearing masks. It'll countries seeing results failing take due care.

'Defies belief really consider happened March April across Europe.

And, worst is, still learn. open things point December lack care display here, everywhere give another couple months we'll left choice lock again. 

There's thing getting house order, quite frank European countries proven incapable that: once, twice, third time. And, asked grasp concept 2 metres follow it. say, defies belief way: manageable event government capable putting together effective test trace system people care want bit.

I scoff United States never done know exactly people like based happening many parts Continental Europe people different.

So, congratulations: handled abysmally badly European countries. going break truck rallies freeways/highways impeding voting Tuesday?? Johnson faults lot, give credit COVID wanker (the two Trump Bolsonaro) take heed virus got hit it. done then... control life People sofa king stupid. I'm Wisconsin. insanity. live small city half population following mask mandate standard precautions best considering workplaces opened up, meaning people sort ""have to"" go work. half seen packed bars football game nights, restaurants dinner family, holding events like weddings birthday parties large sizes.

Our city county also hot spot, guess well that's going. county 3,500+ infections per 100,000 people, yet people huddled maskless bars complaining - gee, wish something people could it! /s

And, yes, say maskless many local business owners completely health, safety, economic stasis nation enforce mask mandate laid Governor Tony Evers. also state republican-controlled legislature handles COVID-19 policies, aka vetoeing everything comes somehow slipping like avoiding Bears fans packed Packers game Chicago.

But digress. personal experience comes fact attending work usual, homes elderly CNA. provide care companionship directed, found one clients hospitalized tested positive, self-quarantining 14 days Friday. I'm getting tested Tuesday, earliest could get also guaranteed test kit.

Luckily, I'm asymptomatic far temperature normal. Though DHS website states self-quarantine close contact even first test negative I'd rather air side extra caution; anyway, finishing last week job CNA moving onto new endeavor right after, probably good time good idea stay home. sad bad people self governing. fucking many them, man agree people take enough care, I'd argue even stuck post-July rules we'd still situation.

It's possible open borders (or soft, unenforced quarantine) let people continually reimport virus overseas. huge chunk recent cases genome linked outbreak Spanish farm workers. 

We end cycle describe long border porous. New York City nutshell One's statistic, one's drama. Americans shit math obsess reality tv. Living Belgium would say that’s one risks laughed spring really materialised. people would take risks mask would out.

It powerful beginning would say social distancing went away summer. course result general fatigue many countries started use masks exchange social distancing part “return new normal” autumn. Many seen matrix somethings seen safe inside mask worn. think sends potentially dangerous message.

Take easy example. agree meet two friends safest way would us take walk. would require mask Belgium. sat beers restaurant could sit hours without one. 

Yes, people misuse them. chin, use cotton mask weeks take call cigarette. It’s never doubt mask work laboratories individually, it’s net effect population worried public health agencies upon un till spring. dumb thing block over. Thanks creating sub Australians Kiwis looking oddly. *dosent appear*

What hell, New Jersey!? sister says he's good job pandemic. surprises you, watching enough Fox News. Science religion, tons people opinion biases. middle pandemic people big picture, people end different bias 

\- Pharmacist : work hard vaccine, test show see good immune response manufacturing ramping 

\- Physician : patient got covid twice, seems people keep sufficient immunity disease, sure vaccine work 

\- Sociologists : strength anti-vaxx movement would amazing get 50% population vaccinated 

\- Epidemiologist : reach herd immunity 60% population immunized 

Thats less various opinion see sub, likely based actual science, indeed might summarized vaccine end pandemic vaccine save us.  Let's hope first True. tried... looking back maybe there's could done.

It's frustrating know people gone life, problems all.

I think long run feel better handled it.... hard pill swallow (watching idiots around problem) RIP little buddy. Fair winds following seas. would deleted? Doesn’t realize pushes undecided voter towards Biden? Lol Studying covid charts

I dying. That’s perfect National defense good, manage masks certain practices, things like rotate 50% crews mitigate capture exposure also require contact tracing. it? 

Seriously everyone, VOTE. 5x worse rest country right remember... shitty gov sent sick old people nursing homes infect others blame Trump!

Here great state Florida don’t let stupid people make decisions. Things awesome. Personally went 4 nights row bars atleast 1-2000 people great time! Agreed  Dig away! I'm offended. I've tested twice. ended ER something unrelated tonsils inflamed hurt swallow. strep. flu. COVID.

Even rise testing numbers though, percent positives remained same.

Madison365.com great tracking tools. nuts here. allowed Sturgis motorcycle rally go 600 thousand people flowed town Sturgis 2 weeks drink, screw watch Smashmouth Here. We. Go. Agreed.  piles hand sanitizer car always use that. 

I used paper towels beginning.... think got lazy (I still sanitize, agree... that's strong possibility, things tones hands per day) team members know would allowed investigate source all.

 That's jump. came GOF lab accidental leak. course going allow investigation.

P.S. Article delete downvotes 3...2...1... shit much preventable. tools make work school home be. Obviously jobs can't whole thing poorly handled people dying it. We’re gonna need bigger bell ? mean countries deal deathly diseases daily basis learn ?

The effect happens US military regarding truth. glad-handing careerists move up. US fallen is. Scott Atlas, else need? Plus democratic hoax disappear 2024.  correct. Viruses tend decrease virulence (severity harmfulness disease) increase transmissibility time. fact, seeing SARS Cov-2. 

Let’s confuse overall assessment pandemic getting better. Globally it’s clearly still progressing

Both things true! im gunna doubt police could would sit hours hours taking names 1 1 issueing fines. Minnesota we're testing 20-30k day(weekends closer 15k). changes mean Swedish model sustainable all? surprises too! Trump try (he promising vaccine week two weeks ago debate). think severe government actions might help. I'm sure would work. There's many variables. 

Federal government authority close states (or would challenged court sure)

We can't/won't give people monthly stipend stay home....

So many people Healthcare. 

Not trying negative, I'm sure see way this. Might also demographics. Indian large young population. Singapore migrant workers biggest cluster (comprising 50+k cases), 0 fatalities. 2020 made hope meteor strikes something ends humanity. go again... prediction thing, predict anything, never predicts, said every coronavirus viral illness ends end winter/summer/autumn/spring usually would've perhaps case Covid-19, predict anything. Id also look way, lot anti masters area, decided play dumb get refuse admit time frame leading positive results would require people go get tested. We've got something like 72 sites testing statewide. days lines. days aren't. cost dogshit communication ruling people, 'eat help out', 'virus retreat, good longer fear it' etc. still think funny people compulsively go holidays abroad knowing dangers. west spoiled little brat long willing selfish asshole? That’s got comment. 

I don’t understand everyone doesn’t realize we’re FUCKING PANDEMIC. I’m sorry can’t go vacation spot year, celebrate couple holidays, go like do, it’s constant selfish acts people don’t care prolong virus keeping making worse like states. don’t like either, also don’t want get virus, get sick point need stay hospital, end $50000 medical bill (but that’s whole different discussion)

I also know I’m minority saw life hasn’t changed much since began I’m fortunate regard. Main thing don’t get go weekly bars friends anymore, realize virus bigger desire hang bar. I'm going way catch it, get it, get it. vast majority people, bad cold. get sick. recover. tiny percentage, still lot people, die suffer whole lot. believe greater chance getting COVID19 take vaccine don't. also take care trust care stand profit this. honestly think enough leaders honest long pandemic would last. Many people rescheduled June weddings October ""when restrictions would lifted."" thought government restrictions ending, fact pandemic probably going rage 12-18 months. 

Most doctors people know pandemics knew right away long would be. government officials want freak everyone out, there's guarantee, took weeks time, months time. everyone kept thinking would couple months, couple months later thought would another couple months. Hence people buying plane tickets visit aging parents. 

Surely it'll then, right? mean *so long!* Maybe us feels long virus.

People understanding pandemics, even less understanding exponential growth. half country gets information propaganda network telling fine big deal focus low death rate percentage, people long term disability this. played Fifa, make coach I'll win Champions League! listen infectious disease doctors. need listen different opinions, including economists, health care experts (including psychologists), education experts, etc. cure cannot worse disease. fair WHO, warned early April (in covid strategy update) lockdowns negative impacts individuals, communities societies sustainable way suppress virus. People really listen part... people dying virus, thus fewer people alive, thus maximum amount fear lower. I'm mathamagician trust say ones ? 

I know lot scientists misanthropic neckbeard who'll love stay home order. seriously... 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember scientsits paid taxpayer, science budgets tend cut every economic crisis, shorter pandemic earlier money science. NY Times probably hoping blames China Covid-19 - never going happen.Also love Europeans talk reforming - continent record amount cases.Before wanting reform anything make sure continent drowning- absolute jokers. Clinical trial drug approved phase IV studies trials continue approval. exactly left teaching job year severity second wave attributed circumstances First World War.[81] civilian life, natural selection favors mild strain. get ill stay home, mildly ill continue lives, preferentially spreading mild strain. trenches, natural selection reversed. Soldiers mild strain stayed were, severely ill sent crowded trains crowded field hospitals, spreading deadlier virus.


From wiki . FUCK destroying society lockdowns. Really productive comment buddy program like would great came provisions exclude evicting tenants. 

In reality, calls waiving rent early also needed met waiving mortgage loan payments too. may sound awful you’re covering banks losses, that’s best way garner enough support actually prevent hitting people really need help. still Thanksgiving Christmas look forward /s AIDS, Ebola, SARS 1, H1N1 wake calls. Common sense source. know thing schools try drown people make work themselves. Hopefully Biden would rehire he’s office January. Yeah, thought same. prepared fornthe zombie apocalypse... bit disappointing taken early. 

It's lesson though.  Plus doctor said wearing masks probably made less severe case.

I think point may become difficult avoid entirely, prevent serious case, might best thing aim for. Stay safe, good luck. Definitely . ! people 3rd world countries kids want though, 1) poor sex education 2) lack access birth control women 3) abortion bans 4) there's still high rate marital rape many countries. country even super 3rd world abortion illegal everytime try talk sex education kids/teenagers conservative right starts throwing flames mouths claiming we're gonna start showing gay porn kids.

I sorta agree rest. Yeah idk sub exploding absolute clusterfuck Iowa right now. see headlines every day I'm like ""wait, Iowa blew past days ago"" That’s love electric car 

It’s charging home charger sits sunlight rapidly disinfects Use head think. No, point Soldiers sick sent back home, trains whatever mode transportation.
This helped deadlier version virus spread.


And isn’t true. He’s confident, it’s cute ❤️ freedom, anybody else unfreedom.

That's opinion way, that's excuse used. course, ethically impossible something like that, frustrating moral cognitive level. hand, also ethics apply medical attention unrestricted. 

When comes choice two grandmas, similar age likelihood survival, one vent, one could protect others, flaunted publicly also infected many others... gets vent? mean, I'm pretty sure we're thinking thing here. Yes. Feels like hit pause. Selfish b@stards. last show went started, boyfriend got extremely sick week day two taking hospital. love shows concerts, need watch go shows sick obviously, even people that. Come on, let's value venues keeping numbers low mini concerts. one parent. one works. Like 90’s touche Ok, sorry sent home back battlefield base camp / city centres troop centred. 

Happy ? 

Btw exact point initial comment. I’m glad someone else said it. Yes, sad situation, however, entirely preventable. highly doubt boy living kind healthy lifestyle. It’s real national problem. think 1/50 states actual normal average BMI. 49 average BMIs :/ states much worse others. survive half year income?

yes, government support - e.g. furlough scheme UK. solved pays every business person go next 6 months costs paid? removes trash cities? processes food ability eat next 6 months, refines oil natural gases electricity heat next six months? tasks require time, money, effort?

The government pays, essential workers carry - would supposed bust ass next 6 months many sit around nothing live lazily? skilled workers supposed risking lives useless degenerates live?

Yes. know Public Health Emergency, continue support communities. Would rather catch covid? Lol time I’ve contacted 5 days exposure. sure good supposed do. 3 Phases according CureVac:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let make something clear you:

when saw report instead carrying argumentation, talked modders it. mods answered would delete original comment already deleted yourself. know fucked comment made, reason character development, believe purpose Social Media feel like win something. 

I warning invent conclusions things proven. 

Coronaviruses neuroinvasive nobody yet provided evidence shows virus ever leaves body infecting you. 

That antibodies something, means, body combat pathogen easier. 

For example, measles infection recover completely solid immunity. measles remain nervous system unable make sick antibodies prevents it. Fast forward become old body weaker, measles start replicate nervous system body longer provide strength keep battling virus. Even though body able prevent virus replicating effectively years years that. 

When scientists say longer detect sars2 virus you, mean proven gone good. 

They longer *able detect it*. jumping conclusion same, virus gone system. means, simply means longer detect virus. 

If actually prove virus longer anywhere body, would kill you, dissect completely run tissue samples, every single millimetre body. would able say certainty, still carry virus not. 

You say reinfection beyond rare, using 24 millions statistic satisfies need feeling safer now. 

But study referenced, claimed 1 10.000. also made sound like real laboratory study 10.000 people attempted reinfected proven impervious except 1 10.000. 

Your statistics make possible conclude claim conclude. *was* possible reinfect individual *same* strain virus, cannot prove all. strain would showing tests, since cannot prove strain still body, simply means would proving strain either reactivated individual become reinfected. 

You want science unknowns. cannot actually study science unless make comfortable unknowns. 

You report warning unknowns, saying want there. Make comfortable fact coronaviruses neuroinvasive cannot know virus dormant could reactivate next time immune system becomes strained normal cold. 

People sars2 virus fluid spine brains, virus nose throat. documented. virus hiding somewhere still feel safe, might make mistake thinking become impervious, much virus still unknown. 

You lie much need keep lying prove bend facts suit comfort. made fucked comment tried help protect put people danger need feel specific way inside refuse debate. you, social behaviour become replaced hostile behaviour see abnormal is. Stop using studies privately conclude studies actually prove deal fact know everything virus. 

Early studies showed many people develop antibodies. studies showed antibodies last long. 

Now studies finding people antibodies much much longer people initially. 

So mindful continuous production antibodies indicator virus might remain nervous system, causing host continue produce antibodies prevent replicating effectively nervous system. top that, coronas cause ANTIBODY DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT, meaning work like dengue, making people sick keep getting exposure. 

Just take care put people risk harm feel need feel good emotions inside you. try charge character development, social skills really needs work. 

Have nice day safe.  question advised travel bans. provided evidence show ever preceding PHEIC travel bans demonstrated work. 

Why would advise implement travel bans evidence demonstrated they're ineffective? 

You're also neglecting mention Italy US implemented early travel bans China. going present evidence suggesting work deal counterfactual. 

The right recommend travel bans. misread thought asking person article DG. yes, DG quarantine. lmao fuck? Irrational? I’m irrational caring people surrounds me? LMFAO. Funniest shit I’ve read today, thank you. Yeah, I’m super jealous bc want careless shithead too, super clever friend many die even go rally? went, got infected did. site probably violates GDPR cannot legally serve you. thing annoys is, people get tested think exposed, test negative go back world. False negatives thing. yes, government support - e.g. furlough scheme UK. solved problem.

I promise entire nation cannot survive half year government pays, essential workers carry - would stop?

What would motivate put harms way? sacrifice lives??? wtf wrong Yes. know Public Health Emergency, continue support communities.

You degenerate confirmed. “Before Times” making lose it. I'm Melbourne let tell you, I'm always proud say I'm here, best feeling. Daniel Andrews phenomenal state premier although copped fair hit last weeks, he's still miles ahead opposition. He's quite treasure. federal government Canberra though, well they've made good calls travel restrictions Jobkeeper payments, they're biggest pack fuckwits imaginable. federal treasurer trouble setting foot back native Melbourne way carried trying force us open prematurely. short though, get leadership demand, Australians got pretty good right now. very, high expectations global reputation uphold clever lucky. never going fumble. Tag Good News, please. easy blame people ignorance, it? That's Dr. Tedros, Director General. person article him. No, something isn’t speculation layperson.

I’m sure find confusing. child. parents “sYstEmS” play here. longer put right/smart thing, harder do.

No one reputable ever said could 'over' two weeks. said needed two weeks slow spread, *and* contact tracing, *and* extra precautions, *and* better PPE, *and*....

The thing is, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, others managed stop least significantly slow spread disease, cannot throw hands pretend result natural disaster. may started nature, completely within collective power keep getting bad. Following science hard, unpleasant thing short term avoid massive death economic destruction long run *has* worked, people willing it.

At end day, people control ourselves. Individuals responsible actions, failed many levels government, excuse people things choose do. nothing wrong blaming individual taking selfish actions known put others danger. clearly know much GDPR. cookie warnings old (and around better part decade much older legislation) achieve GDPR compliance whatsoever. 

GDPR much comprehensive framework involves attestations responsibility, clear data residency adherence, things difficult achieve companies based EU. small-town newspaper whose audience primarily US-based, no-brainer try geofence traffic restrict access Europeans. 

GDPR pros cons. clear, yet another step march balkanized, fragmented internet. Hes absolute idiot. Depends local case count.

Few local cases? Pretty safe. Rising cases percent positivity? Heck no. winter coming exercise activity makes people expel virus, chances still safe idea going down. (Be careful local area testing LESS that's reason case count lower.)

This whole situation sucks. troll around you, bud Except concern new viruses even know exist yet. measles vaccine nice all, help regard. Sounds like you’re jealous people aren’t scared irrational you. work Yes, there's article sub that's trending:

**WHO Chief Quarantine Contact Tests Positive Masks help b airing classroom regular basis effective method reducing transmission. Technically yes, better actually higher adherence. I’m willing bet, seen, people actually willing quarantine 14 days (especially there’s enforcement). However, significantly people would willing get test beforehand short quarantine another test. knows, vaccine might transform take economy.  *Big bran time translation* 
Most people dumb make choices unlike circle friends bastion intellectual enlightenment sea darkness ignorance.  Hahahahahahaha Well, first post *this* article. article Glendale's one several rental assistance program Arizona, city work directly landlords instead tenants. City officials say allow efficiently obtain paperwork process claims. landlords apply assistance missed rent payments behalf tenants ready access lease agreements, rental rates like. state's rental assistance struggled quickly deliver funds, part paperwork requirements tenants must owner receives aid, must wait 30 days start next calendar month begin eviction proceeding.

I think seems pretty reasonable.

If National system like this, would probably better off. Sadly ones denying issue exists also ones don’t get obesity risk factor. Outbreaks. Plural. also blame people shove garbage gullet. It’s time stop acting like it’s forbidden knowledge Zebra Cakes aren’t staple food.

Personal responsibility thing. cheap eat healthy eat garbage. make grains chicken dirt cheap. beans etc. Obesity massive issue, please look larger systems place cause obesity (as opposed blaming individuals): corporations, technology, lack access public spaces exercise, unhealthy societal relationships work, etc. tell smart, educated friends think key conquering covid? :pulls notebook: agree masks aren’t solution. Defense depth Swiss cheese model risk mitigation. 

However, it’s understanding European spikes cases loosening restrictions masks can’t worn (I.e. restaurants, bars, etc.). that’s case it’s misleading since masks aren’t worn situations. least way they’re supposed COVID lets people take drink breaks. Enclosed spaces + poor ventilation + HVAC system = infection.”

Thats unique “only restaurants” though. thing could said public-buses small shared offices grocery stores etc. 

The location irrelevant. is:

* density people/crowds

* hygienic (or not) people are

The reaaon restaruants Bars “hotspots” anti-masker “you can’t tell do” idiots (and young people think somehow superpowers immunity). 

If people followed rules, restaurants wouldnt problem. develop permanent immunity”

Most studies far show antibodies fade time,.. T-cells show longer “memory” ramp creation new antibodies even extended periods time. (and showing promise therapy:  never recommended lockdowns primary method control. blunt tool high consequences. parents schools enforced dress codes? think spaghetti straps dangerous covid. Even Fauci rehired, still loose pension he's fired. honestly think enough leaders honest long pandemic would las

Remember CDC told us ""we might take break normal lives 2 weeks""?

Peppridge farm remembers. Im South Korea (Canadian).  lockdowns.. city 3 million like 7 cases week.  could handled much better many places.  Korea learned MERs mistakes. didnt canada learn SARS1?  

Its fruatrating year.  things havent perfect either (far it).  Korea gets A-, Canada gets C best.  wont comment countries attachments Americans (the sane ones) barely functioning right now. shit ton people none less clear long time: many countries community transmission has
led outbreaks near exponential growth, countries
have introduced widespread population-level physical
distancing measures movement restrictions order
to slow spread set place control measures.
Physical distancing measures movement restrictions,
often referred “shut downs” “lock downs,” can
slow COVID-19 transmission limiting contact between
people. However, measures profound
negative impact individuals, communities, societies
by bringing social economic life near stop. Such
measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups,
including people poverty, migrants, internally displaced

and resourced settings, depend daily
labour subsistence. going there? bad, 3rd wave, many dead? see point, somewhat agree, believe could done. wrote disappointed lack leadership many levels handling outbreak. fully support steps taken, studied science University understand exponential growth. I'm appalled lack effective communication displayed public health agencies around teaching people undertake steps called one thing really risen forefront this, least area, give public health agency power world give great PR department convince people important, power quickly ends meaning sweet diddly-squat. rely police enforce rules people agree understand them. Hope supporters reminded everyday rest lives. can't die somebody work him. This. goverment write whatever check needed allow 70% america stay indoors 1 month. 30% people needed make sure power water stay food comes doors recieve ridiculous levels PPE hazard pay.

Then month life could go back almost pre covid days.

Mask wearing mandatory, people refuse stay home face charges treason, contributing need another shutdown.

If legit medical reason wear mask, health insurance required pay allow stay home spring. insurance, Medicare pick tab. 

And happy pay higher taxes next several years pay this.

1 month hard core government funded stay home would significantly reduce case load. Letting us get back almost normal.

Oriole actually using masks social distancing would keep low, spring vaccine set things right again. said syndrome?? mean like jackass directly comment calling ""teachable moment"" childhood obesity? kind asshole? clearly propaganda like everything else subreddit. possibly new york would 1000 people gather single party time square? Always knew India would grind out. Immune systems steel bred generations. ""Delhi belly"" saying. last 3 influenza pandemics originated developed countries.

The H1N1 ""swind flu"" originated Mexico.

The inoculation farm animals order reduce losses causing ever-increasing superbugs enter food chain. solution next pandemic probably much closer home. US, even live, government adopted strategy problems require collective action, make seem like individual preference. way hell individuals overcome global pandemic individual actions. That's governments for. provide guidance support overcoming collective problems. That, he’s surrounded loyalists. doesn’t realize firing Fauci would bad idea nobody willing tell would be. mean agree scientist....but mechanisms vaccines...I addressing whether Fauci actual info candidate vaccines...one thing would temper statement though, antibodies still accepted ""main"" effect vaccines, becoming aware key mechanisms too. many examples injecting antibodies huge effect. Youd probably known Trumper. Thinking beat little know science back Cheers

""How could get this? I'm confused!"" thank food manufacturers America childhood obesity epidemic. put carbohydrates form sugars, broken molecular levels easy absorption, everything make. happening hundred years, accelerated greatly since 1970s 80s

Don't forget impact fast-food advertising, existence food deserts poor urban areas, fresh foods literally unable obtained.

Yes, *technically* preventable problem--kind of--but problem much systemic harder overcome personal level people want admit, may inkling of.

I know, know, people know better, read food labels, choose themselves--but look food labels, many different forms sugar given product? There's good reason labels long filled chemical names.

Sugars broken molecular chains easy digest play havoc insulin production, there's also epidemic Type II diabetes--which used called ""adult onset"" diabetes, used rare. sugars come corn.

In book, *The Omnivore's Dilemma*, Michael Pollan points corn single successful species entire planet, thanks human beings, corn isotopes found every living human. Even animals eat fed corn, avoiding one's diet, do, let escape corn isotopes dominant body.

As says, ""The great edifice variety choice American supermarket turns rest remarkably narrow biological foundation comprised tiny group plants dominated single species: *Zea mays,* giant tropical grass Americans know corn.

""Corn feeds steer becomes steak. Corn feeds chicken pig, turkey lamb, catfish tilapia and, increasingly, even salmon, carnivore nature fish farmers reengineering tolerate corn.

""The eggs made corn. milk cheese yogurt, came dairy cows grazed grass, typically come Holsteins spend working lives indoors tethered machines, eating corn.""

I'm going stop there, list foods containing corn one form (or many multiples forms), goes enormous list.

I've gained control weight part, eat manufactured foods, I'm kidding even whole foods come from. 

I'm mature, retired person decent education, responsible supporting family low wage job. imagine hard parents today, lifetime. tend disagree.

Most infections 1 1 infections. refrained contact mean death vulnerable person, many contacts. Try build infection group - group people little contact people outside group possible. Inside, contacts A-OK.

I'm Germany ""scheduled"" lockdown November. November (or longer, depending long lockdown last) kids adults choose one household. go meet anyone household over, anyone schools class, since schools still open.

The idea minimize potential avenues virus spread, reach us, make easy warn everyone contact us. Anyone us positive test? need warn small group isolate quite sure spread infection far wide. entirely false


BLM protects outdoors definitely wore way masks plenty research showed little influence spikes, meanwhile Trump superspreader events masks outdoors venues kicked outside.. wouldn’t return school ever Trump done lot things people would say about. directly constitution use platform promote we've found empty words page authority stop him. safe go gym?

I've got planet fitness nearby always good cleaning even pandemic, even better cleaning stations set everywhere, staff clean equipment people cleaning equipment use hand sanitizer everywhere, pretty empty, mandatory masks, touchless check-in, machines use spacing okay. think temperature checks thing besides employees tho. sound safe? I've sitting home since march going need to, want anything rash, getting hard stay home 24/7 They're equally dumb. virus discriminate based ideology. shit Sherlock, every body well. gives shit us got country 360 million Trump leadership country 24 million land mass almost size slightly better leadership went 6th austin easily couple thousand shoulder shoulder masks lol even cops You’re right, give bored it. /s tests used antigene tests, tests antibodies. I’m sarcastic. It’s disappointing even discussed point. Makes sick think selfish many Cold symptoms alone big red flags. headache fatigue usually part Covid, specific Covid. Fever, loss smell persistent cough indicative. Wait out, there's high chance battling common cold.  none those. worried since live uncle 50s.

Are RRT-PCR really accurate ? New Zealand. know getting downvoted. sister nurse, great, 1 year program high school went straight work. one year long, also 6 month programs nursing assistant (often people taking vital signs doctor sees you).

Basically anyone go become nurse. admissions requirements lax. lack long term testing scares me. normal circumstances, I’d never even consider getting new vaccine little testing behind rushed market. I’m going especially skeptical there’s one vaccine it’s promoted US. want see countries also promoting one multiple, would make feel comfortable it’s passed different vetting systems (even they’re relaxed normal).

I definitely say tho 100% getting vaccine I’m pregnant (I’m early pregnancy now) likely won’t get either kids vaccinated since they’re low risk anyway. see successes little news side effects maybe second third year I’d get vaccinated, I’m chicken risk health now. I’m anti-vax slightest normally politicized vaccine rushed market scares me. Dang it! Ok, Imma build Montana. one lives there, right? one notice. According city, private homes. Bars, restaurants, everything else negligible. else need ? 

The test tubes swabs 1918 well ?

Others say might return FSU spring. students say feel “stuck” FSU either concerned professors accommodating move home, conditions families aren’t conducive studies. Two parents also responded say FSU “is job.” scary getting car accident, needing emergency surgery ICU bed getting turned away. shouldn’t cute, terrifying. I’m Canadian comes across certain efforts steal election pay off. prolong virus

But.... lockdown expedite things? Like locking would ""prolong"" virus?

Also, selfish admit life changed much seem primarily concerned getting large medical bill? want REST WORLD give everything working, eating sleeping, sake

Yeah, keep calling people selfish. ""No, government, watch feed kids!""

The ultimate shirk responsibility - children hope right. I'm repeating read. Shut  even said ""on record"" part surely realized meant? mean, course get virus within seconds. able to? ""viral load"" scenario? takes 2 seconds sneeze accident. That's plenty viral load right there. increased travel shopping 

I expect black Monday super spreader event nationwide  Although first case, Trump certainly going give without fight, seems :( Posted again. Stop looking clout. Indeed. Pretty sad comes money. Could infect someone else receiving vaccine? I'm worried infecting immuno compromised person can't take vaccine themselves, mean still risk infecting take vaccine? .... tiny island nations closed borders. They’ll remain shut international travel vaccine comes Laterally anything else better option.
 
The idea either 'win lose' idiotic. Measures save 100 lives save 100 lives. Measures save 100,000 lives save 100,000 lives. ""Fuck let's give can't perfect"" tiny American thing say.  sick obese child checked out. probably thyroid problem something. Studies show ...

Do they, though? would highly recommend correcting wiki entry. 

Now see everyone microbiologist like you. froggin around. straight. probably person hosted party's. Dislike people personally hate this, due ongoing pandemic. nothing wrong. reason care. family , want get sick all. 
I tell, see feel boogie man outside. pandemic over, care w.e around like before. simple.
Snitches get stiches... looking god father? laughed. one says today, call loud. person loud, that's it. Welcome world. 

No one ever said anything shooting one. said live bad neighborhood. costume to... probably live suburb every one goes Hi, good morning. time see you.F.... Wait.. No. Ok much deal. Well, let's make 48th party good, worry anyone took pictures. That's travel ban. Mandatory quarantines recommended WHO. Count calories. changed life. OP's comment confused well... Wrong  Wow projection much? think one line comment try get empathise another group outburst? Yet every single one responses paragraph long rants filled assumtions personal attacks. It’s almost like people aren’t going hide bunker rest lives like guys. Shocker Where? Hospitals always like 90%+ capacity since trying optimize profits. plenty capacity surge one dying can't get care. People dying fear mongerers scaring going hospital treatments people think isolation lockdowns effect.

People binary thinking. touched past looking earlier results trials. example, Oxford researchers found tests monkeys vaccine prevented virus infecting lungs test subjects, virus present samples taken nasal swabs. means infection localized nasal cavity. virus could replicate lungs, test subjects experience symptoms consistent COVID-19. check Trevor Noah's trump impression daily show. oddly cute, like raspy baby. funny call US plan. Current infected numbers worldwide 40 plus million expected increase winter season. 

If vaccine pushed next spring together already infected recovered, expect things “back normal” summer? travel bans worked - way there's difference travel ban border closure - would imported cases all. That's myth travel bans. failed US Italy. common sense appeal travel bans. outbreak happening somewhere, e.g., China, ban travel China problem solved, right? 

Go look evidence posted above. ends happening there's over-reliance ban, fewer IPC measures taken (see US example). Also, people want go want go. Instead flying China US (because ban) fly China Australia US. People lie they're crossing border. allow travel hotspot monitor people coming better monitor test them. 

Travel bans seem like obviously must work, reality always adhere common sense. BS. virus contagious, know since January. can't blame individuals misguided measures incompetent politicians. fools simply come back ""But whaaaat BLM demonstrations riots, hmmm???"". doubt infections happened way, outside usually masked, even less 2m apart, proven several times spikes infections *not* happen weeks started given location. she’s probably LPN RN. huge difference maybe put pressure employers offer paid sick leave aid mitigating influenza infections.
The amount people die flu also unacceptable. Okay understanding travel ban bit different probably. China hasn’t banned countries yet require everyone China 14 day quarantine, which, nonetheless, effectively travel ban me. Tesco really know kind democracy America is.

At moment? isn't.  What’s unfortunate chance. countries managed well back normal. US ditch years. 2020 ultimate year denying personal responsibility. Nothing choice. Everyone victim!

In truth, right. There's excuse \*at all\* people uninformed make bad choices. Everyone circle saying virus big deal, doctors making money inflating counts, political. Wonder getting from? Again, intellectual laziness much higher would ever imagined. government failed us, especially top. realize pushes undecided voter towards Biden?

Undecided voters day election high profile really exist meaningful number.

This get help GOTV effort base literally 10% body fat, lift run six days week, played intramural soccer rugby sports stop Illinois lmfao. told daily chant ""CCP virus"" keep virus away. Chant ""Wuhan virus"" lessen pain. sorry, it. Let’s completely ignore role gluttony plays

In places like TX, servings restaurants massive - enough family three share. used one people. eventually grew up. dArE AsSuMe HeAlTh pHoTo! It’s easy compare New Zealand United States different many ways. get you’re saying many places bars still closed. don’t large controlling nationalized government , it’s local states enforce. That's mirror looking at, picture. innocent mistake. # FAUCI UNCHAINED Yeah, everyone died. covid denire yeah kids died issue them. handful died morbidly obese. clearly huge contributing factor. obesity epidemic far worse covid. poor boy :( response ""Fire Fauci!"" chant, said: “Don’t tell anybody, let wait little bit election.”

Here's story video saying it. wife factor V gene mutation (significant clotting risk). blood specialist said immediately call office contracts covid significant risks monitor. wont go detail scary AF.

Heterozygous homozygous factor V? Fortunately kids well behaved neighborhood. large party going somewhere nearby though. Mitigating problem starting January require lockdown. South Korea executed US plan less 500 deaths. thing headline. goal mean it. media always this? Lots cities still closed, places ever completely reopened, states considering rolling back more. It’s hard deal many patients torture weeks ultimately dying get one save patients age bracket. 100 mile round trip every day. lived sticks commuted city. Cost £10-15 diesel +£5 parking. wear tear things happen stuck home lol.

I 19 time living home. first ""proper"" job, glad took grind real. I've poor. Eating healthy challenge sure. getting fat isn't.

It take education know certain foods going expand ass others. Especially every single packaged food buy nutritional info packaging.

Most people obese either ignorant lazy anything it. Food availability price little it. available PopTarts, eat less them. complicated.

That said, one group control children. kid severely obese parents, old enough making choices eats dinner every night. Support what? Colombia doesn’t even money feed poor times good. going get now? expectations “the authorities” third world countries completely unrealistic. Colombian people caught cartels, US government, political corruption last 50 years. much power think authorities have? like her, voted her, Trump like coming antichrist, I'm religious. man immoral unethical corrupted, also hypocritical (there way honestly religious). nothing good there, rot. is. 

BLM protestors dumb gathering pandemic, likely blacks died COVID19 protests police.

Trump rally goers dumb gathering pandemic. They'll like making things worse themselves/families nation love. Natural selection spoken. How's BMI? Seems obvious I'm glad proved it. even understand could get weaker. now?

I believe, though know definitively, government stopped stealing inbound PPE shipments states selling highest bidder. could definitely worse Christ, thank you. need post Reddit I've coffee really, another 10 20 years best Netherlands water.

I vote anyone though. they're going chalking annual flu deaths covid doubt make seem worse actually is, lying public making worse is. favorite part said big parties shit. people go parties thousands people it’s shit way spend time. completely delusional think Trump gives fucks controlling COVID-19... NZ island million people, US massive country hundreds millions people No. People need willing sacrifice careers long term financial stability COVID. Dying exposure street lost home work? Well least COVID! Reddit needs Sarcastic Haha Button. zero regard citizens another way. (hopefully well known) John Hopkins information test positivity rates (but also sort new cases amount tests carried wife prescribed blood thinner like Colombia would never able afford that. person would able tell that. never cosidered. Yet corrupt politicians still pursued policy knew work country cause social economic misery. also concern: looming mental health crisis among hospital staff. PTSD exhaustion, also anger elements communities take virus seriously. long risk health people seem care? Biden would rehire he’s office January.

I assume Fauci gets fired, Biden hire onto transition team. I'm certain Biden's transition team tons Covid focused experts, get highest profile he's free agent? Y'all fit police broke BLM protests people lmaooo make valid argument. However also surrounded ""educated"" ""smart"" people. 

Even ""smart"" people adhering recommendations. Even ""smart"" people question experts form opinions based absorb. based inherent beliefs. 

Or even arrogance. selfishness. 

Source: quarantine due actions one types people. called former Flotus socialist trying get kids eat better. Republicans deserve vote, unless it’s dog catcher town rabid feral canines. depends area. Current science suggest activities involve talking much safer, even heavy breathing generate fraction droplets compared talking. require people wear masks exercising, even better. much ventilation distancing done also matters. Try rough estimate. (Their bar ""extremely risky"" exactly think be, may want compare risk level things already do, like grocery shopping, get better idea risky something is. look percentage risk small print bottom, big colourful letters.) area, “parades” certain candidate, getting 9,000 - 10,000 people participating time. masks, social distancing. It’s going long months. hospitals already screaming rooftops they’re full stay home. Say people businesses whose livelihoods depend social gatherings. Covid lockdowns first foremost failure governments take measures mass testing, contact tracing targeted quarantines. guilt tripping individual persons. US even closed? travel ban cases imported right? Meaning caught get inside spread virus people. Taiwan, New Zealand...... met people?

having customer service, people dumb shit. Dumber even. breed, teach willful stupidity kids. need authority charge, fines jail time. would better good education system got rid “entertainment news” live made, adult babies don’t know ass hole ground Hell, NOW. 


This thing hard everyone. easy super dilligent first couple months, even see people around taking ""risks"". Even people TERRIFIED beginning done things like travel summer. 



We supressing human nature hard last 8 months.... likely supress even rising cases looming world (The thought new lockdown sucks, think matter time Canada.) taking toll everyone. whole situation sucks :( Thank empathy. comments heartbreaking. They're poorer country really needs tourism $$$. I'm border state many friends Mexico constantly they'll let party hard want masks touristy area US democratic republic, would never allowed America. We’re closer Greek city states terms design. you’re describing scary support it. tho? test double blinded, one access phase 3 data yet? Unless started review (This question). Getting lucky ~10% chance correct. Asking since got buried end yesterday's What's general advice stopping isolating symptoms headache [NHS ok stop isolating 10 days even symptoms (cough smell loss) present, symptoms (fever, vomitting, diarrhoea, sneezing nose running) mean isolation continue. headache fatigue mentioned; wonder anyone knows scientific public health information either way. Sorry, respectfully disagree. B- far high. D+  still don’t enough rapid testing, enough contact tracing, enough compliance social distancing hospital PPE still good (I still get 1 mask week non clinical worker, bed side nursing gets 1 day, 1 per patient encounter). good position approaching winter.  Agreed. Even boss fairly conservative, credit, said anything government necessary handle, it.  I'm anxious election cuz one ignorant asshole other, I'm anxious society react either outcome. protests/riots packed. masks perfectly protective even densely packed areas, can't go back normal world, except masks on? Fake news. joke sure thats people calling story think make great point US possibly pushing vaccine great, countries pushing suspect best. can't blame wanting get pregnancy! doubt testing effects vaccines may unborn child. I'm hesitant get 15 month old vaccinated reasons. Congratulations pregnancy best luck little one! hope able stay safe healthy! Thanksgiving going kill lot people. let’s give option besides vaccine herd immunity nationalized lockdowns designated “green zones” forced Chinese style lockdowns lock home.

It's not. Stop presenting bullshit false choices. 

 

You teenager annoyed parents let stay late. adult talking global pandemic. Act like it. like people make argument did. cannot afford time sit home kids day, every day. unless going watch kids pay childcare, kindly shut mouth issue. Trump can't keep anything secret except COVID dangerous implied! world? Thanksgiving Christmas going along planned among friends family. Thanks. think way!! I'm work right bro.
I live nice condo family. probably staying home big deal me.
My home nice place be. really feel people disappointing lonely home life situation. U.S. failed state. extra unemployment ran months ago we've one stimulus check. 

Even poor people want listen WHO, can't -- else they'll get evicted. WHO's primary audience really member states, public. certainly communicate directly public, comes questions essentially policy (e.g., lockdowns) communications national governments actually implement policies. Obviously know seem little strange people around world saying thing last couple days. Good think mom... color pills? paramedics get they're going need know help you... daredevil risks life something stupid. People denying severity covid running around killing people encouraging others likewise. Nobody's going make leave mom's basement rest us want get back normal, dude. hide forever think sky falling long want. San Francisco. rise 30 cases mayor shut reopening plans.
Very strict succeeded. bad rest country. sneaking suspicion stuff like would happen. Like fuck nurse US right now. Doctor too, least making bank considerable risk. see *lot* Canadian nurses doctors coming home states winter. 

I arsed risking life sanity treating people refuse change behaviour. Get back BC Toronto. cared children nation would reinstated Brady Bill. things West Africa days? work home. wear mask go store. I'm visiting everyone's grandma block. Thats executive order changing civil service status issued donald. wish shared optimism.  'Suggests' appear appropriate word here. 'implies'. wonder what's him. That's going win swing voters. Perhaps he's flailing around like lunatic. much ""pro-life""

I've literally never seen ""pro-life"" person. pro-birth give fuck live child woman. here's admit defeat. literally stupid talk to.

Hey, bad flu, go volunteer old folks home get with? I'm sure fine. bad flu, all, could use extra hands, I'm sure.

Have fun. What’s even better party posted page get tested became symptomatic. 

Unbelievable seems schools weak link here. Speaking someone lives east coast first visit torchys last fall... would sell family science experiments get back enjoy tacos punch. often literal dreams punch.  Problem many deaths people attending rallies. loved ones passerby's stores. forget 2 month period potentially lame duck Trump office. mention suspect turn entire process circus refuses accept defeat. 

And wins think he's invincible (more already does) become even tyrant already is.

I've never legitametely anxious election. next week going scary. Probably unable follow EU guidelines harvesting personal information. Wanting fine, long actually it. Watched Totally Control. Still independently verifying lot, it’s appalling seeing know happened connected together 2hrs.

Edit: also fuck Jared Kushner school bring additional counselors Wednesday **when students return middle school support**.

Cue *pew pew pew* sounds that’s like saying getting doctorate actual doctor thing. They’re called “doctor”, it’s completely different reality. You’re muddling water order make bad argument. job adults protect young tools self govern.

Putting harm's way collective gatherings abhorrent.

We condemn big parties schools?

There never enough talk public bathrooms lunches would work school building. can't fucking idiot would think kids could handle this? can't even get stop sticking gum desks.

They know unsanitary schools are. school janitors decision makers politicians since know bad would be.

Collective life work pandemic.

You tax slave class state daycare needs condition young go keep machine running. one day feed machine. listened lockdown part (largely) forgot use time implement long-term management suppression strategies (which always advised).

As Kiwi, I've surprised New Zealand lockdowns famous education extensive trace contact strategies developed alongside them. New Zealand successful put number viral escapes recently without resorting lockdowns. Contact tracers rapidly identify close contacts infected put isolation. Genomic testing used try determine source outbreak. public kept upto date lot technical details included - think incredibly important, people happy part, understand why. Cry river lol. feel bad kid’s parents. It’s matter time Alex Jones Trump says life fake news. say hate poor people able isolate go work Get bullshit outta here, 3 friends weekends include playing DnD basement doesn’t mean young people don’t like go out, socialize, dance hookup. None activities taking place standing 6ft apart masks on. Here's latest case/death charts Arkansas, running 7-day looking good.

Arkansas currently 63.87 deaths per 100k population, ranks 21st per capita they're ranked 5th 7-day per capita deaths (hot watched well work elsewhere.

Here MA, went bad period, right things get numbers down. said ""the numbers down, go back living way made numbers go high"" - surprise, numbers going high again. like places that.

It's like watching someone pull hand fire burning - hand burning shove back fire again. stupid. people allergic notion maybe maybe modicum control lot life. 


All bad things befall random externalities. thank food manufacturers America childhood obesity epidemic

What parents feeding kids? food manufacturers shoving food throats. Everyone. That's really good question I'll need ask. Can't remember. remember consult genetic testing pretty depressing. ended basically worst case scenario mutations (factor V isnt one. Can't pronounce 2 others) Trump wins, Fauci quit work country better grasp reality  let’s give option besides vaccine herd immunity nationalized lockdowns designated “green zones” forced Chinese style lockdowns lock home. no, don’t want I’ll take option letting vaccine nature run it’s course. 

Why none worry long term ramifications allowing that? Don’t think would abused used means control? That’s history tells us would happen, man naturally corrupt therefore governments naturally corrupt. Allowing large control lives temporary safety terrible decision. It’s getting people vote 

Although Trump great strategist. It’s instinct could New Zealand did? closed borders. ""leadership"" started immediately called xenophobic racist. peak ~100 cases day. likely far beyond February even known issue. would ""strong leadership"" done differently, knowing knew then? commented it! saved grandma! Coronavirus Circle Jerks  8 points · 1 day ago  SUFFERING SAVING YOU

Do troll downvotes? This. dumb may be, listening definitely made things worse Forever. literally described normal day day existence clinical health care professionals US. nothing new. Thank you! knew people going start bringing weight right saw sweet little face. shameful! better yet proper lockdown.. schools still open there’s solution distant learning? US careful things. ""Allmänna råd"" best translated ""[Administrative think Trump made kids fat? Laughable. Wear underpants pants tier funny. Underrated comment right approach I’ve taken. wife child one family neighborhood see. Neither us venture beyond little bubble, gives us enough socialization keep us sane. Then, somehow one us contracted virus, web would small. Perfectly said. Yeah outbreak Europe nothing fact kids went back school September. Nothing all. What’s really upsetting lot us don’t fucking choice.


Like fill “survey” work (at restaurant) let tell you, want real answers. fully expect work unless *obviously* showing symptoms. 😕


My best friend symptoms waiting results, spend time together work together job. told job that, like, “Oh well, let us know results come back.” Fauci telling people wear masks, save healthcare industry, demanding industries give hospitals PPE, needed keep lungs, time, Amazon blocked sales anything remotely like mask individuals, including non-medical paint respirators, PM2.5 respirators people breathing issues polluted cities, said people would able take summer vacations, important part American mental gotten comfortable celebrity doctor politicians call want ""expert"" read people's work like one hot South American weather girls. needs go. first response title “no shit”. surprising amount woo nursing profession. reading carry (ie lockdown) 2x numbers Easter. lockdown later week hope prevent numbers. Seethe. Nobody's going force leave mom's basement vaccines come out, dude, chill. undecideds Wrong lol hospitalized truly believe reason country (usa) isnt taking seriously killing children. . reason society whole (looking antimaskers) dont care Grandma dies.

If mutates becomes virulent lethal children antimaskers pretend wearing mask along

For example one Trump supoorter community took Covid seriously became political. good risking immunocompromised family members adhere political ideology. I'm looking forward seeing cuteness face leave office.

VOTE clear enough average person. People read said ""see... lock downs bad never done"". understand lock downs response failure properly contain virus less severe measures. understand certain circumstances argument lock downs made. understand periodic lock downs needed long significant part population respect social distancing, mask usage personal hygiene guidelines. Trump president thus focus media criticism. Duh? 

I around much Obama president. imagine left-leaning reddit liked him, also plenty stuff liberals pleased with. Hell, hard find liberals ragging Biden here, particularly bernie bunch. sure, isolate island country sustain large amount time without travel, able it. That's realistic US, realistic Europe... think we’re mostly back normal next summer regardless availability vaccine. Mask wearing social distancing two summers row going happen. Here's latest case/death charts San Francisco, running 7-day good job far.

SF 16.80 deaths per 100k population, less 1/4 US per capita average 69.31. anti police demonstrations, sub would cool know feel better others Broken beyond ever thought possible like (Feeling alone this) breaks knowing wide spread. never person felt needed drugs, lately feel like finally understand persons desire hard drugs. I'm them, despair heavy long little things used make happy making happy longer, finally understand feeling wanting feel good costs now. No, need him! Hes one things that's keeping country together. Fauci 2024 Hey now. us try avoid public wear mask kept kids home online classes quite working well. lump us there. comments harsh, really know getting downvoted. entire notion obesity something akin weather ""strikes"" randomly mysteriously needs put down. xarelto since ""event"" something similar life. specialist said blood thinners generally ineffective clotting caused covid though sense security there... hope never know fitness influencer died covid19 recently right?

With due respect dead, cares? 

In demographic, white male 50 fit, good area, good insurance, survive 99.5% time, floor. 

Because live alone work home, stand 0% chance spreading scourge home work. 

And know I'm going catch it. matter time. year, next year, year that. Covid-19 going away. Ever. 

By, dunno, 2050 so, give take couple decades, another cold. people come contact with? think afraid it? Well rhetorical question understand feel entitled decide deserves die. GDPR covers far banking data. covers things like personal data GDPR broadly includes data like IP addresses. 

Basic data like IP addresses used sorts logging functions - ads (although definitely ads). logs - used ensure security integrity site example - allowed exception, sometimes okay. meet items? taking logging European IP addresses even make European data processor? (Actually, part, yes does). updated privacy policy? named roles required GDPR? check boxes default opt-out? 

This tip iceberg. would bother? much easier geofence claim ""reasonable attempt collect EU personal data"" implementing above. December going real bad US Thanksgiving gatherings. *I fear year most.* 

In places now. admit ardently lockdown orders information. 

Back March fully prepared take seriously hard yards family did. masks, go out. turned May... June, July, August things kept getting punted real actionable results. 

And know much COVID now. Imperial College model wildly wrong, like orders magnitude wrong guy made model criticized past almost absurdist apocalyptic models events. 

In beginning told going kill 3-4% people got it, would put par Spanish Flu pandemic killed 50 million 2 years. wildly incorrect. total IFR covid averaging 0.24% younger healthier counties low 0.1% 

And know affect children... like all. tens millions cases globally count serious cases children one hand. 

And even talk fact average age death covid actually average age death overall. Even hardest hit categories old sick people still 86% chance perfectly fine. 

And I'm sick told online I'm grandma killer wanting open back up. question risk assessment. done much damage livelihoods tens millions people estimated 3 million Americans never economically recover this. Globally collective response pushed 100 million people back abject poverty. choice economy people. economy people. estimate 75,000 100,000 people kill deaths despair due economic downturn doom oriented people talking saving lives. fact even celebrating saying stuff like ""fuck business give shit"" Twitter. 

And rewind little decade ago swine flu pandemic killed close 600,000 people tell people nobody remembers shut world make everyone live like hermits. 

We've lost sense risk management blame media creating hysterical feedback loop. media gets everyone hyped up. Politicians act seen something. media continues feed fear, politicians see positive results pushing ever draconian restrictions we're stuck ride can't get questioning official narrative makes mass murderer. responses see online doom gloom people walls. politicians see realize can't ease restrictions without costing career double down. 

And I'm done it. Um... people loosely equate EU Europe - y'know, free movement across borders jazz. karma. that’s okay

I'm sure ok half subreddit make term introvert look like exhibitionist, anyone heads asses understands 'goalposts' are, going view suspicion.

Not life return 'normal' vaccine released, vaccine even fucking job. hope covid destroys lungs Wdym? Versa 2 totally compatible W10 Strap on. going quite ride! Well, edited comment, recall exactly wrote, way phrased, implied target 50% (otherwise would commented). apparently downvoted based initial wording. Thank clarifying intended meaning. Ok win perspective smart interesting Wouldn’t NZ thread without “but they’re islands!” comment. outside inside? Egypt’s leadership far competent.

Better make sure control knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers then. source post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* piss Egypt’s leadership far competent. Also, Egypt literally less 2k active cases. didn’t talk Aussies comment. masks protecting people again? protecting others us? Travel bans also never worked contain virus. Seriously, called obvious corona denier bullshit comments deleted civility apparently matters mods. 

Hey mods there’s big difference civil discussion allowing trolls go bullshit unchecked. People wear masks chins even places 100% compliance. obviously explain everything. Risk ratio according ""Factors associated COVID-19-related death using OpenSAFELY""

Asthma:

With recent OCS use: 1.13 (1.07–1.20)

With recent OCS use: 1.55 (1.39–1.73)

Full PDF: Table 2 full list conditions, cancer, dementia, obesity, gender racial factors. think know look like friend 🍩 list people caused trouble/issues pandemic basically put blacklists possible  Hate burst bubble sport lot countries reporting almost zero new cases. 

Granted right wing media outlets crucifying people made happen hey, fuck right wing everything represents regardless. shined state leadership agreement health important economy fucked either way much worse nothing try contain virus. 

Our federal leadership absolute garbage part, passing responsibility states, blaming problems happy sweep take credit goes right. sniping sidelines towards state political allegiance rather helpful.

For example Victoria premier assaulted sides months end ""just open up"" rather trying rid community transmission. one grateful told go listened medical professionals best curb virus. I’m interested source well. *""The spread rapid tests could help fight pandemic, said Drosten. “If available sufficient numbers, test vulnerable groups regularly low threshold,” ""*

This generally believe solution.

We need rapid cheap tests! Like $5 test (or less) 15-20 minutes results. would game changer.

There also test asymptomatic people run app phone, analyzing sound / frequency signature cough. I'm bit skeptic, developed MIT University, works approved could also help lot. strategy along, hasn’t worked. Europe, along many US states like WI mask mandates. 

In many places, movie theaters closed. one seeing movies. Immune compromised not. 

And yes, advising people risk much sensible approach shutting society everyone. personal decision, government one unless situation extreme. it’s sense word, extreme point. videos actually better there. He’s expert, means, presents info simple, concise way.  am, staying home part assholes this. don’t worry, we’ll closed back time. 4892093 baguettes Look, can’t argue anecdotal evidence. CDC Infection fatality ratio 24 year old .0002 .02% according CDC.

Yes, assume 0.02% fatality rate result 24 year olds careful currently are. became really nonchalant said ""well, fatality rate low big deal"" fatality rate might actually increase dramatically.  asked Dr. Fauci said shoot neck. would unethical ask patient wearing mask beyond scope information needed assess treat patient. knowing exposure enough. doctor read Drs notes often side healthcare I've never seen get quandaries patients, happens TV.

A LOT people receive emergency medical treatment selfish. Think people speeding motorcycle helmet think look cool. Someone shooting gun thinking look cool. Riding horse middle nowhere prior experience think it'll inspire them...or literally falling death take photo place standing. could go could debate hours counts selfish not. 

And none matters. role hospital system pass judgement anyone. talk mad shit stupidity gone? Yes. everything need make sure leave alive? Yes. We're literally terrible exponents well. People seem always slamming CU Florida schools, Texas bars popping parties everywhere. Good idea, I've edited wiki now. Holy shit mitherfucking Seinfeld reference That's minister justice, Grapperhaus, party nobody adhere covid rules. long time denizen Irish pubs Portland area, I'll fun wee bit anecdote. According DHS website current testing capacity 42,474 tests daily. really fault since can’t force people get tested. cares

Possibly royalists. 100% understand you’re at, case get hate this. lot us boat. conventional bananas face disease threatening wipe out.

Hell, even first time happened. NYC grad school years ago, went Halloween club night organized NYC subreddit. people meet go first place super awkward, went there. 

If city, generally things super hard find. Last year Boston, bunch friends went Halloween-themed circus/burlesque performance local theater. mostly got floor standing seating got balcony table partner think good time.

I'm ""old"" (30), Halloween become scary movie night candy whether pandemic on.

I overweight particularly attractive, understanding attractiveness helps, also suffices least one attractive social friend. social fun around, keep getting invited around. either really helpful (I got parties helping stagehand friend setup) money always bring decent alcohol, also helps. sociability key, attractiveness. Often people use Sweden example shooting ""herd immunity."" couple things make different US: 1) Sweden pull shit together function unit, instead bunch screaming babies. told isolate, isolate. 2) people Sweden live alone! makes huge difference rate transmission. family home spreads Covid like crazy, direct contacts isolating (which US) . . . yeah, that's bad.  bunch anti maskers probably betting vaccine letting everyone go outside live normal lives, reality probably enough supply even keep demand. Seinfeld! almost feels like~~ we’re testing test. we’re taking contact tracing seriously, testing isn’t ~~as~~ effective.

There FTFY. right. I’m sure everyone’s satisfied much got. can’t money. cell responses present individuals six months SARS-CoV-2 infection. cellular immune response directed range proteins virus, including Spike protein used vaccine studies. However, comparable immunity present additional proteins, nucleoprotein  remember outbreak traced button panel, remember one bunch people rode office tower elevator infected person riding too. live mid-rise building although we're told ride lift anyone else, definitely breathe shallowly I'm it. cough symptom? Exactly!! definitely expect us work unless physically positive test. 😒


We sign near one POS’s says something like, “We don’t call outs.” golden era internet unified, global, boundary-less entity sunset.

You make seem like GDPR responsible instead trashy sites like make money stealing personal information. EU actually authority balls enforce, everything covered GDPR closer rose tinted view internet ever been. Teachers aren’t babysitters. Nice try, though. May please link original? Jesus christ cell responses present individuals six months SARS-CoV-2 infection. cellular immune response directed range proteins virus, including Spike protein used vaccine studies. However, comparable immunity present additional proteins, nucleoprotein usually take educated guess likely place. Fat Last time got tested told too. work told CDC told needed negative test chose quarantine I'd penalized accordingly attendance. send thoughts prayers every time school gets shot up. politicians receive another check nra nothing ever changes. care kids. really care fat kids. Maybe super hot 15 y/o white girl perfectly target demographic people like Trump clinton.... ..odd. careful use swearwords anything civil. may role, times like everyone listening say announcements big impact public opinion related matters COVID-19. Tits Cry river lol Statistically, chance die something else COVID within 28 days test quite small, cases would case outnumbered people dying COVID diagnosed COVID deaths. Honest question, what’s purpose making seem worse actually is? life me, can't understand thinks good thing announce election. Fauci high popularity rating. comes around goes around right?  Sure, not. I'm low risk category one could be. Hmmm, wear mask? comment makes much sense therefore downvoted Sorry realize talking delicate flower crowd. Stop drinking sugary drinks. bad childhood habit. drink water, tea coffee (no sugar). schools universities staying open could take rallying cry finally admit obesity epidemic ruin end many lives Covid ever will...……………. probably not. People get defensive, people make excuses, nothing change. state live btw? I'm willing go 2 dimensional analysis. Everything year election related. Everything. miscalculated early doubled afterward. pretend altruistic fighter people, he's cartoon villain either. There's big gradient work within. campaigning over, expect moderate stance. scenario see continuing win, even then, think continues is. find narrative claim whatever changes makes approach always would done. excited since doctors appointment That's numbers september France ... We're lockdown till christmas now. let guards  You’re moron want guy bloody obvious mean, didn’t Chinese literally weld people quarantine? Yeah that's right, economy cratering, tens millions jobs disappeared could years return all, education entire generation stunted, deaths dispair way up, huge rise depression, loneliness, substance abuse, pretty much everything everyday life people enjoyed involve looking screen table LOL Well everyone fucking supposed to, we’d I’m racist. Spain stole celebration Mexico Spaniards destroyed indigenous people. You’re racist appropriating culture. good indication mask usage doubled. (sigh...). countries Europe locked March April. quite simply, majority countries simply money repeat kinds lockdowns (you can't force businesses close without guarateeing kind financial security). quite easy say done public health perspective, lot factors controlling response virus. Actually several countries succeeded essentially eliminating virus: Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand. thoroughly understand sentiment. city shut 2 months early on. retail, restaurants, bowling alleys, theaters. feel like thought sucked, understood greater good. now? seems like nothing. Cases rampant county. We're taking steps backward.  think worst is: end sight. *knew* June 1, 2021 things would OK again, think could sort pull together get it. stands, there's way knowing.  

My kids 13 17. 13 year old school since mid-march. I've watched go social kid basically loner.  Yes, kids technology have, like said: people meant isolated like this. *nothing new* happening day day...what even talk about? 

Sigh. 

Sorry hijacking post.  *is* hard. feel things look forward stolen away. oldest basically senior year taken away. depends are. It’s ridiculously overblown, it’s Vaccines wont. Proper hand washing will. Probably thing agree on. ready let benefit doubt assume local newspaper data stealing vampire 

How think sites like make money? fact straight block EU visitors biggest hint do. know can't make money them. agree I'm seeing people across board showing work symptoms mild. many people working paycheck paycheck trying miss work anything workplace cultures toxic calling sick especially Canada. Boss want gone 2-3 days waiting covid test.   Next try tell water wet.

I healthy kids refuse send school. responsibility parent right thing schools told wrong thing. fucked I’m Rochester NY. study Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine handled Rochester Clinical Research. walked target weeks ago saw 3 people enter exit door masks on. Refused put on. good. child obese failure parent, full stop. feel sorry kids. Fucking lol. 

He made predictions knew anything covid trump massively botched handling it. America would locked fuck like rational countries politicized pandemic, probably would gotten summer vacation. ""Damn Trump spreading virus!"" Distance learning doesn’t work everyone. ADHD I’m usually 3.5+ GPA student, semester I’ll lucky get C average. know college students usually always top falling behind.
Plus research shown high school middle school students possibly lost YEARS worth progress “dIsTaNcE eDuCaTiOn”.

Not mention poor families don’t money get babysitter nanny kids working. Plus working families still send kids nanny daycare anyway. Might well send school least fuck education good.  Yep, doesen't seem easy achieve real world. agree subject taught national level either school via widespread campaign targeting fathers. Sorry came accross condescending previous post. Yep. Either mask shut month lock down. It’s really easy easy never easy fellow Americans. everybody polarized subject?

In large part condescending assholes like yourself.

How's financial security way? forcing idiots line. much I‘m individual liberty, come cost people's health. trash Sturgis study put economists, must say I'm pretty wary Stanford economist study well. know well done well methods really work. one least immediately fail eye test. I'll take deal 🤝 want midwest well solely manufacturing farming products tend remove ""Poltician says \_\_\_\_\_\_"" posts purely political and, allowed, would never end. Malaysia around 1000 cases day....  takes time, knowledge, money eat healthy. 

It's fast, easy, cheap eat like shit. People reddit judgmental hating fat people. Huge sections society terrible eating habits bad habits get passed generation generation, making hard break cycle. Even middle class, surprised number people can't prepare healthy meal. hate it. don’t give shit weight. little boy’s life value society number scale doesn’t change that. 

How insecure must someone say little boy deserved die weight? kind joyless existence causes people seek sort attention? that's thumbnail.... Anti Maskers lockdown skeptics (of lean towards) use argument 

“It sickening! 99.76% recovery. Median age death...80 years old. Curve flattened respect deaths. Herd immunity growing. Kids generally affected. Many symptoms. Great therapies available. “

What response comment? 

I respond worried I'm waiting learn long haulers, Death doesn’t worry long term disability does. absolutely matters. People aren’t gonna accept “by end 2021”. Nobody losing another summer this. much better normal? Ha no, it’s night public holiday can’t even get half empty bar terrifying guy president leader United States. nothing bully. dictator. promotes violence. Fires anyone disagrees him. Refuses listen experts. Lies time; everything says lie. Makes things promotes fact feels certain way things wishes way.

I've conversations past week two separate people told children incapable contracting impossible coronavirus without showing fever coughing

There's nothing done people like these... news, news outlet (liberal conservative), children get spread virus many people asymptomatic. People hold beliefs unlikely touched PR. people fall ridiculous category. Flat earth type people. 

I also fully understand top medical professionals wrong, really blame them... unknown, go educated guesses. But, I've fortunate... employer absolutely fantastic- something I'll always thankful for... pay impacted, I've better financially pandemic (mostly due expenses going way down). man, small business getting hammered COVID/restrictions, I'd pretty damn upset ""oops, wrong"" (even that's completely irrational way looking it). 

In general, agree :"" going bad long time, here's estimate based XYZ... we're putting place why... fluid situation things likely change"". matter spin that, that's weak ass PR. boils ""we're clueless"". vaccine lot manageable NY averaging less 20 deaths per day months now, uh, no? remember hearing Jan/Feb 2021 earliest. Trump pushing election day vaccine lives little world. 

And technically lot vaccines, need go long term human trials make sure there's terrible side effects. Yeah honestly sounds little pathetic.
If can't live meaningful existence without socializing problem you.
I see friends family time, hang outside (this normal us pre-pandemic too)

Get hobby devastated can't go bar whatever.
I know economy suffering places, booming others.
Its doom gloom everywhere, adapt survive. never left local government, even state level. kind infuriating kids able go school since March, yet schools 10 miles away still school still playing sports. bars right street still packed every day. caused gluttony? countries fatter others? states cities fatter others? “gluttony” problem, zip code born within influence chances obese? always go back individual - that’s U.S. discourse fall back upon. makes conversations like nearly impossible have. Unfortunately one wants listen. believe one know personally caught it, died it, there's way real. quote Trump's recovery, forgetting level care got literally best world. Hey Stranger — Happy (early) Birthday! Everything even remotely related entertainment gatherings. I'll first line see overwhelmed ICU's. know three people work hospital losing hours nothing do. losing income, hospitals losing income. Take tour please! ever occurred people countries done nothing address pandemic things would much, much worse? proof measures work proof virus incredibly contagious.

Sadly hindsight 20/20 people idiots. Comorbities? also note positivity rates Madison still 7%, low compared lot rest state large hospitals, yet we're still point. According Wikipedia statistics, around 66% population. 

Taking considerations children, elderly working/studying abroad, great number participants. Germany. 25% newly infected even idea caught it. Yes done that. Trusting people quarantine stupid. New Zealand too. Cause makes sense. People dumb. Don’t trust quarantine. instead get miserable protracted time. Useful, detect asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic non-cough symptomatic infected daughter works fast food. 100% got there, brought home us. :/ Sure. ""adults"" reddit want change either. Look controversial simple 'don't drink soda' message is. can't imagine life without soda. Given fact COVID-19 also blood clotting disorder, actually somewhat necessary probably still undercounts. know someone died back late April due ""previous undiagnosed blood clotting disorder"" ""respiratory illness"" probably uncounted COVID-19 death (they never got test, back difficult unless severe respiratory symptoms).  Thank this. comments rotten people sick. 
💜 first I’ve heard curevac.. would considered 2nd generation vaccine? interesting live Manhattan drive NJ often giant Whole Foods H-Marts.

NJ compliance better Manhattan compliance, surprised me. must cluster infections people/family gatherings. mask compliance spot there, NY. People wear masks outside parks even walking alone sidewalk. see much NYC. Many do, people wear outside. November babies unite! parents got valentine's day are! that’s opposite.

Fresh uninfected troops trenches allowed virulent forms selected trenches.

If OP said that, wouldn’t asked Soldiers sick sent back home, trains whatever mode transportation.
This helped deadlier version virus spread.

This claim. sick soldiers sent home spread virulent strains.  Look psychology. many people resisting sensible measures world-wide pandemic, theres credible possibility government trying (or even wanting to) impose measures theres need them. promoting dystopian fantasy government would actually want. way better ways educate government goons claims fraudulent election nd send supreme court. think rushed ACB fast? Mask mandates also seem municipal bylaws rather provincial federal.

Mask mandates Provincial, provinces delegated municipal level. strong weakest link.

Hopefully humans realize bottom falls out. trust American people make good choices families.""

Which frickin' hilarious, given American people already proven beyond shadow doubt left devices, far many going make good choices. remember early pandemics government saying masks (because didn’t want mass public stealing resources frontline people) focused respirator production large corps using executive military order. 

How focusing N95 masks testing everyone? think current “face covering” mandate still failure people wearing masks different quality (some less effective compared other). Lmao live west side Chicago.

Which makes argument seem twice uninformed. grew doesn’t make are. live dead smack middle hood don’t even follow whatever code you’re talking 😂  think would helped sort Halloween guidance. seemed *really* divided town, since trick-or-treating officially canceled, people carried like normal, less them. know couple people hosted Halloween parties. :/ child died first thought seeing “no kidding”???!
Not oh poor child. Oh poor family.
It “no kidding”. pos. Halloween second favorite holiday. can't imagine Halloween. pretty big around here.

Not everyone parties hard. Plenty people marathoned themed movies (Addams Family Netflix!), made mulled cider, etc. got curbside cider donuts weekend, highlight me! Whenever someone makes fun systems, always feel bad shows don’t see much get fucked systems blind to. great day. single sucks right too. LBH virtual dating sucks nothing excited makes worse.  mutates becomes lethal age groups, give 50/50 chance people smarten up. Lol win election. Trump \*lost\* election. reason pushed get kids back schools worker class build empire.

Or maybe get education screwed whole life. immunizations things. Yellow fever, typhoid. Cholera, Japanese encep, etc. MMR helped infections perhaps vaccines well?  think irony whole thing- I’ll first say someone able work jobs home I’ve able make also save money simply places closed. Financially I’m better situation eight months ago. forget 70% Americans can’t afford $1000 emergency. article cop blaming victim. Used leases people getting nutty leases 2020 bolt Kids dumb stop drinking soda. parents teach eat properly. Unfortunately, bad parents set kid lifetime disease poverty parenting. want know many people died, click updates week state drop menu.


~340k including flu pneumonia year, **7k** confirmed influenza.


So probably looking another 100,000 people dead covid included official numbers, counting death certificates simply written yet. \*sigh\* Ya... Despite downvotes, you’re 100% right. Doctors medical professionals get loads trouble leaking medical records. Asia are, what's Europe? thought this. dont optimism like you. know much already lying cheating now. watch. Bush thing. Comey McCabe two examples come mind immediately, easily found google it. know, thinking thing many decisions last several months. actually think could re-election would stop extreme, bullying anyone disagrees with, attacking democrats, handling covid even tiny bit better. simple things.

Instead, keeps rallying core base would vote anyway. alienating lot people. ever go speak campaign undecided voter, democrats (which done people always vote person running party see better alternative). 

I experience marketing campaign strategies confident could done better job whatever advisors almost guaranteed re-election. Instead, either bad people around him, listen (probably likely) focused boosting ego stray away appeasing core base order retain strong support admiration. wish speedy recovery.  

this cannot understand: fucking selfish idiots hurting people like dad. understand taxed hospital system affects anyone everyone needs medical attention??? Honestly doubt it. places might contributed it, they've open since around May least country. think probable explanation vast majority people simply returned daily life going work/school, using public transportation fact entered respiratory illness season. sort advanced access data least advanced access/regular conversations top experts working it. I'd imagine way better sense what's ahead most. He's muted diplomatic updates far fact tone seems moved optimistic tone lately encouraging me. lot made enormous second wave eu, I'm wondering if, us ever gets wave, gonna see even bigger second wave us well? I'm guessing kids. would mean Big Government higher taxes pay high paid civil servants slack off, everyone else best pull bootstraps. /s idiots think sounds badass. think lot us wish jump line “appointment” you....😉 False. South Korea locked everyone crossed borders, imprisoning 2 weeks forcibly removed families 

Would worked here? done here? person grew poor uneducated parents managed become educated myself, literally zero clue even start becoming healthy 21 years old. point 360 pounds, one land whales. managed lose 110 pounds realized change living would die due cardiac issues diabetes. one explained me. can’t expect uneducated people educate themselves. child much easier know importance health. 

And honestly, you’re poor, food food. taught eat never let go waste, lead lot overeating.   asked lady across could please cover nose, said 'I'm exempt' (suuuure, wear mouth-covering mask?) switched different seat, snorted rolled eyes.

I've never met woman, hate burning passion. read article? element issue media filter. vast majority people read/hear filtered media. asymptomatic transmission issue great example this. Many months ago Maria VK explaining recent contact tracing data highlighted appeared truly asymptomatic people (i.e., never develop symptoms opposed pre-symptomatic people - eventually do) rarely transmit virus. point, explained, encourage national authorities effective contact tracing possible contacts develop symptoms traced properly. 

The media passed message asymptomatic people transmit virus failed highlight point eventually develop symptoms properly called ""asymptomatic"" ""presymptomatic"" are, fact, potentially highly contagious. 

This got spun around anti-mask types saying sick people spread virus, like saw SARS 1. Maria clarified next day group pointed said ""ah ha! flip flopping."" And, use favourite line ""the lost credibility."" truth explained well, headlines produced media outlets distorted truth. Yikes dude cells make antibodies... We're talking humoral immunity. cellular. cells protective immunity. What? Nothing said incorrect. I'm struggling find source 3-6 month window described. scientists saying could last year 60% efficacy. Considering survival rate thing 99% low-risk individuals, application vaccine kind longevity success rate 'high-risk' individuals would massive terms quelling outbreak. Particularly taking consideration first form development continue. heard nordvpn? death. also 40% country pushing us toward oblivion ignorance.  Really? I'm subscribed hitting paywall. logic using, what's different instance child something harmful themselves?

Is kid failing school abuse? drugs? Self harm? Getting injured football wrestling? That’s true. used past, still underdeveloped countries, cheapest foods ones filled sugar carbs. mention food deserts exist country. Good point - need masks mandates also still need restrictions bars, restaurants, gatherings. (and financial aid businesses employees) 

Masks, distancing, limited time indoors (restaurants, etc) OP musta died 'rona finishing title! government restrictions little impact people gathering, traveling, etc. already stopped prior formal decree. going way open back up. official government response lag behind society's actual behavior. sure did!!! Happy Birthday!!!!! 🎂 someone attacking us? 99% military stand we'd totally safe still? think answer yes. continues cut health care try privatize it. Exactly need pandemic /s Mandatory masks? they?

Thank you!!!!! thread helped morning. It’s nice know one feeling lost. That's gonna help holiday case explosion... /s thought exactly! Tf corn isotope? Corn-14. don't. 

But communicate governemts approach well hand. people know expected go full spaz. 

When lockdown clear expected us. Go home stay home. kind. Stick bubble. supply chains fine. 

Bit fuck erie. Whitin minute shops closing. People streets saying goodbye's. See flip side. 

I went vet get dog cat food bottle store shit kicking off. going stay behind give manager hand. Turns three times sales Xmas. aspect going focus gdp, sure guess? bu there's lot life that. undead business though enough effort possible new government support! saying will, maybe some. mean, guess forget Atlantic Canada BC good hold compared provinces. see daily browsing reddit europe first time 50 years contagion threatened human race global scale. Particularly US, acceptable anti-vaxxer moron and/or believe anti-scientific fairytales. Since considered major societal faux pas like atheist childfree, people gladly believe crap preserve 2019 way living. understand well. Sometimes want forget are. choice. care? test data? freedom burn neighbor's house along yours, yes thought too....but come think would still risk children’s lives. Really? That’s news me. Time knowledge sure, it’s myth eating healthy expensive.

A bundle bananas less 20oz coke. apples cheap, peppers cheap, celery, broccoli, etc. items cost less bag chips cookies. 

Chicken ranges price depending much care free range, organic, etc. frozen chicken expensive either. 

There may correlation low income poor diet, believe much education actual income. Really? prove wrong, downvote run away?

Grow up. Unfortunately, people want wear masks distance. Due antivaxx movement, one four Americans said get vaccine. know else done. It’s difficult make be. Hefty fines, incarceration, proper policing two three weeks would’ve much effective 1 whole year wasted nearly 150k casualties. Italy got control similar tactics worked. None legal. realistically speaking practically, yea. 

Absolutely nobody going sacrifice another summer shit. Enough enough. things closed, people gather party beaches big groups. We’re seeing right without vaccine. 

I mean there’s reason humans live packed together societies, constantly surrounded one another. beyond heart breaking  rated level headed comment. Yeah I’m going continue feeding real fruit. Thanks suggestion though Cool band name Yeah...

Alot people gave media asymptomatic people considered contagious. get wrong are, believe pretty clear main vector infection. People start shedding virus symptoms, often get symptoms need focus on. (contact tracing, etc...)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, province Canada, government essentially every possible symptom COVID symptom. makes hard focus specifics. understand want stop spread COVID, think focusing solely dry cough fever, loss smell/taste would go long way...

&amp;#x200B;

Instead right kids runny nose schools get covid test, really counterproductive. late...thanks kinds idiots work overtime gatherings crowding lack masking prove bad things happen nothing done. Post office workers railway workers seems increased risk getting Covid, according Slovak testing results: Exactly, locking staying inside harm good. us already decided take risk extreme mental distress. It’s worth ruin quality life over, I’m glad people realizing this. “The research UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC), Public Health England Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust demonstrates robust cell responses SARS-CoV-2 virus peptides timepoint participants following asymptomatic mild/moderate COVID-19 infection.” Yes , wonder effect age etc Tcell response. feed fat kid much. complicated take personal responsibility.  kid allergic peanuts say welp brother always ate them. Same. two healthy teens virtual school rest year. I’m less concerned death, concerned long term organ damage Slipping breaking neck highly contagious. Convince self. Oh mean like ""ended"" countries listened lockdowns such? Google ""France covid cases"" ""Germany covid cases"". Lockdowns delay inevitable. point assume everybody US knows somebody who's caught it, somebody who's lost friend family member. Almost 3% country confirmed case, almost 4% Florida... There's way asshats know someone who's bad. give fuck. can't true, Reddit told school openings never linked COVID spread before. Viral load patient. lot factors play gluttony. lot actually genetic. believe google twin obesity studies start reading up. huge genetic component overweight people like completely dismiss despite science backing up. Excess deaths people denied treatment hospitals due covid rules ie Cancer patients others due operations denied pushed back, flu season going tally alot false cases annual flu deaths, deaths occur every year chalking covid. Contact tracing basically impossible large countries USA France. New Zealand small island nation population 5 million people so, they’ve working them. Taiwan too. “suffer many freedoms.”

r/coronavirus, ladies gentlemen says “the majority” people doesn’t mention specific figure. would big difference say 55% 95%. fair never expected outright “end“ yeah like 60 70% effective side effects 80% compliance would nice probably going reality… Merica, cost 10k dollars, require referral specialist, count pre-existing condition. idea could someone doesn’t take covid seriously. I’m sorry. Alberta done this. EXACTLY. Let's get rid fire extinguishers building use them. Oh look fire, wish proper amount extinguishers plan contain fire take whole building. known !!! Back work everybody, widgets make themselves. Hmm, real question spin *still* tell people covid-19 dangerous threat forever? can’t trust Iran’s,China’s third world countries numbers.

Then letting propaganda mislead you. Maybe country like NK Eritrea two isolated world completely hide massive losses. People going horrible harsh lockdowns happening China. Pretty sure they'd hidden HK protests could keep going could. Iran one worst hit countries early completely public knowledge. Unfortunately ""working sick"" mentality become utterly ingrained within American psyche, impossible pandemic flu would break way thinking. disgusting. blame individual. individual entrusted government job, government failed. well.. No. Next question. determine though?

The way determine kind abuse, judgement trained professional social worker.

Prader-Willi rare special rules put place it, ASD present flavor texture issues surrounding food that's difficulty parents handle. kid eat anything chicken nuggets, feed nuggets *don't overfeed them* nuggets, they'll stay healthy weight height. 

I'm discussion giving parents non neurotypical obese children extra support help navigate unique challenges, I'm also OP - abuse. beating neglecting children mean harming oversupply food. care. kids bringing back adults, parents care long receive free babysitting. Soo much this. family members absolutely express ""pro-life"" stance practically single issue voters comes issue. Yet, push say well must okay social safety that. mockery term ""pro-life"" said, care point child leaving womb, pull bootstraps mentality. CDC currently recommending 10 days first symptoms assuming fever symptoms improving. symptoms develop, 10 days positive test lot people think cooperative side fence. unity one side other. 

&amp;#x200B;

It almost war, Technology curse sometimes. also live Chicago people around don’t care all. jewel/Walgreens/etc ton people wearing masks :( Yes maybe, theres number studies suggesting Antibody levels decreasing time gives hope longer lasting immunity.

I presume vaccine would create similar Tcell memory ?

""Paul Morgan, professor Cardiff University, involved study, said: “The work provides welcome dose optimism Sars-CoV2 infection (and immunisation?) induce robust sustained protective immune response, although yet prove immunity infections require longer-term surveillance larger cohorts.”"" tested real capacity try identify exactly algorithm learned significant sonic factors differentiating COVID vs non-COVID cough? hearing something like vocal strain associated frequent coughing, extra mucus throat, would hit false positive anybody throat irritation COVID. article specify control tested different diseases.

I think generally public gets way excited AI without realizing AI process that's fed data. However perfectly try make equation data *never* know focused obviously stupid illogical way differentiate things. They're smart, they're blunt force tool works simple association trial error. I'm pretty infrequently happy idea using one critical circumstance like COVID testing. Sweden's case let infection spread society Nordics, covertly triaging going on, perhaps understanding palliative care enough, time proud hospitals could cope situation.

Some people Sweden militant giving specialised care elderly might die soon things anyway. Swedish mentality society sometimes bizarre behold Nordics. Especially fronts forerunners improving life quality. [‘No Way Prevent This,’ Says Nation Regularly nation case, someone Melbourne COVID mass shootings rare, well...  Everyone pull weight, believe responsibility would've meant we'd clear May disingenuous. would've required global lockdown 2-3 weeks. Every single person would need stay isolated time. single person get COVID-19 time, start over. That's simply feasible global scale.

We could country basis, ban travel country duration pandemic. One case entering country could mean back today. would incredibly difficult given global inter-connectedness countries. morbidly obese ultimately choice, general obesity pandemic country due poor regulation No, that’s slightly different comparison. That’s comparing per capita death since start. 

This saying SD’s per capita specifically day would X number deaths day US experiencing one day per capita deaths.

Initially alot people considerate, minority inconsiderate. people considerate became inconsiderate saw people inconsiderate (including president USA).

&amp;#x200B;

Now almost half people inconsiderate.

&amp;#x200B;

This really culture thing. Asian culture always aggressive comes type disease (flu etc...), extremely lenient North America. common thing family go gatherings cold even flu... instances people go serious symptoms, mean contagious though. would always get least cold Christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing also funny mention, people know (which highly educated) thought got cold outside ""cold"". know would catch cold contact someone sick. thought flu thing. Yeah, stupid fucking poor minorities dying COVID . follow rules??

(I hope sarcasm evident enough post get removed) Yeah, sure. literally bad flu. Like seriously hold candle flu. speaking personal experience. one bad ones. people know got Covid thought seasonal allergies cold. 

I would take Covid million times catching flu. unhealthy food often cheaper much accessible, terrible food regulations, ends way many freedoms, deep misunderstanding freedom comes public safety? Great, let's things. 17 states statewide mask mandate plenty mandate enforcement mechanism. 

Near me, 2 bars cited ignoring 10 PM alcohol sales cutoff following mask social distancing requirements Halloween. citation comes immediate penalty enforcement mechanism. weeks state liquor board hears cases assesses penalties. cases gone mostly wrist slap penalties - 3-5 day liquor license suspensions $300-500 fines. I'm defending *him*. I'm defending rational honest discussion. people continue think binary fashion continue confused surprised world unfolds around 3 dimensions. “Be curious, judgmental”

Walt Whitman Thanks, someone tick behind age, agree go route. saying kind understand people fall before.

How months thing people still understand possible educate children without killing them? different versions covid19. travel bring back one different continent someone dies strain. might ""beyond reasonable doubt"" 100% problem. 

The provinces defaulting decisions made economic outcomes priority don’t fiscal ability shoulder lockdowns. 

I’m disappointed haven’t heard premier step say federal government leaving island backing financially. That’s provincial governments failing. 

The federal government passing buck letting provinces set policy.

Do leave doors open let raccoons ""nature cannot controled""?

A brief severe lockdown would drastically reduce current number infections cases. EVERYONE wearing masks social distancing keep spread small.

Halloween night watched tons people trick treat (our neighborhood big Halloween celebrations) without masks driveway I’m wondering crazy crazy. think you’re right. sad. true. catch (or virus) largely goes away week. obesity still there, even find healthy eating exercise lifestyle that's sustainable long-term, risk factor many diseases beyond virus. NZ small city island. hear every day count 1 3. Cmon stop already. dad also 70 definitely see one old people all. article shared actually mentions neighborhood committees reason successful managing pandemics. neighborhood Wuhan organized committee residents volunteered help monitor temperatures track isolate sick members. decentralized form action helped CPC dramatically. Good work Slovakia 🇸🇰! say hoax well time consuming im getting paid day im waiting doc. kinda lame. feel perfectly fine. fever anything. Right.

*Essentially* eliminating eliminating.

You get numbers low, can't stop it. give fight, go back work would nothing return to. Who? indeed drink flavor aid, appreciate historical accuracy. actually think UK's policy masks, actually one, pretty sensible paper -- late initial uptake them, use never pitched panacea, instead additional measure used contexts maintaining 2m distance difficult.

Unfortunately government also totally cocked contact tracing quarantining systems, communicated rule changes poorly humanly possible, aggressively reopened en masse first sign cases dropping summer, 'sensible paper' goes far anyway. 

I'm truly sure idea masks one thing matters, rather one useful tool arsenal many, came from. impression particularly American line thinking I've heard UK folk lately too. COVID-19 R0 thought 2 &amp; 3. Couple incubation period sheer number people US. Point is, LOT armchair epidemiologists talking easy stop spread. Haha either city me, happened literally everywhere. I'm American, live jurisdiction love foreign man.

We're terrible half assed job, either give up, apparently. actually following science quit screwing around.

No, must sacrifice fellow citizens lives health, instead. Year year. Baal, capitalism 2020? Call whatever want, argument made rules due hoax causing people dying mass. beyond ridiculous. I’m incredibly sorry. absolutely heart breaking. actions Trump anti mask followers smacks faces lost loved ones health care front line workers putting lives danger every single day. patience gone. join rage Trump ignorantly following lead. can’t take anymore. Biden loses complete total breakdown. Maybe people put pressure politicians actually fucking something then. We're point parts U.S. hospital systems going collapse nothing done, people cannot afford lockdown currently help government. Yep friend's bank works take survey morning they're ""sick"" can't come they're PTO take day unpaid. Strong incentive lie need money. 

The flip side wife's job they've ppl call saying feeling well, try come back work day later wife pretty sure wanted day know one's trying take chances right much pay posting ads? isolating? job Also herd immunity thing people get reinfected! ""If adequately warned public health experts, epidemiologists, every major medical organization, objective reality soaring infection rates deaths widely reported reputable media. everyone's fault ignored listened fox news know-nothing randos facebook."" going drive second spike Utah. looking good! surprising. little world thinks epidemiologist one blame, least place blame on. Fine 2,000 pound each. Give 1.4 million small businesses affected lockdown. Sounds fair me. Mask mandates unenforced spotty best.

Do see 100% compliance certainly don't.

If do, envy community live actually care fellow human beings. Provocative headlines 2020 basic logic No, responsibility backing ridiculous far-fetched claims. Although, seeing can’t even form complete sentence spell anything correctly, I’m surprised slipped mind Pretty much, get lungs producing much breath? Let's innoculate untested rushed vaccine virus 99.9% survival rate even work according Fauci ""that's okay"". There's long live forced isolation almost house arrest even city's suburbs allowed go fewer restrictions. like we're seen plague rats made example of, reality damned. 

I guess cracked month ago begun think way city handling pandemic theater point. There's carrot end lockdown stick, stricter measures arbitrary metrics little isolate people, drive poverty, push socializing underground, discourage testing actually sick. Imprisoning whole city end sight long already suffered much many us survived dangerously sick almost help (but officially infected due testing early on) cruelty point.

Note caught April going outside, getting groceries occasionally delivered, washing everything could came in. still caught it, said necessary, tend think we're showing fear hubris think stop thing all. learn live somehow. refuse call ""pro-life"" people. never ""pro-life"", majority literally support death penalty. don’t tell expecting vaccine that’d resurrect every person covid killed need stop afraid death let people free. I've got friends nurses. One seems care safety comes virus. Going bars maskless, dining inside.. Baffles government intervention (stimulus, etc.), locking stopgap, emergency measure best. Without government intervention, really extension privilege wealth white collar workers.

It's realistic assume people stop working multiple months year ok. Instead calling restrictions shutting businesses, government leaders need figuring way least harm keeping things going. course ideal, expect people lose work, shelter, food anything unrealistic. number broken November first week. say exclusively cancer patients Really? ones? re·cal·ci·trant

But shine light systems might worked well. interesting conversation cultural advisor council Friday. Really knows shit. Absolute top bloke. We're literally testing test. even quarantine properly. People disregarding positives think false positive ""feel"" sick, people going feeling little sick got false negative. mess. Yeah, agree. I'm UES. Compliance outside truly spotty, especially outdoor dining right sidewalks.

People say, ""Buuut I'm outside!""

Yeah field alone, sure wear mask. Manhattan, always around people. Wtf. That's depressing. hoping rest Canada would smarter. 40,000 medics, troops, administrative personnel volunteers fanned across 5,000 testing sites scheme used antigen swab tests, return results 15-30 minutes less accurate standard PCR tests. Young children exempt. People chose take part must also go lockdown, according rules. “hard blows”? It’s vaccines work. experts ever claimed vaccines eradicate virus. bring IFR significantly though allow us go back less normal life. want people stay home, pay them. It’s simple that. We’re it. don’t know happen soon spring, agree people get back normal vaccine. Maybe won’t huge events next fall, masks could well worn certain areas situations long time - like NYC public transit example. don’t see magically ending next spring, vaccine knowing far less chance dying covid ... yeah sign peace mind far greater medical knowledge production capacity 1918. Even hospitals overwhelmed, it’s going erase 100 years knowledge Best solution calling lockdown least 2 weeks a) source.

b) One links crappy Google citation said getting treatment covid rules preventing it... covid stressing healthcare system. valid (and arguably one valid) arguments covid killing people)

c) telling 300,000+ people US (I figures countries) died beyond excess entirely cancer patients getting treatment due 'covid rules'? Covid killing anyone, people dying operations pushed hoax? heartbreaking, truly sorry happening you. Bring cash where, house I'm meant leave lockdown? happened GameStop? shut right away, opened masks limits customers? much herd mentality. here’s think nationwide lockdown would go....

President/federal government closes borders states. 

Governors issue stay home orders.

Municipalities/cities enforce stricter lock things like curfew. 

Local police law enforcement attempt enforce measures fines. 

Federal government national guard ready state requests assistance.

That’s probably straightforward answer. Whether political set precedent like whether people comply without rioting another question. Thank asking obvious unaddressed questions 1 28 infected Florida. There's that. Women deserve sovereignty bodies. Period. discussion needed topic. People breaking hospital supplies raiding delivery trucks. Imagine would happen actually said masks help. Sharing border US help. Lately hotspots BC near border crossings, meanwhile Van Isle almost covid-free. China? poor leadership wasn’t willing close borders enact strict lockdown first place? irony China done pretty well one countries citizens go lives normal. I'm leaving largely accurate, another commenter pointed thing ""corn isotope"". People stupid. read signs, obey doctor's orders, overeat, indulge bad habits -- list goes on. way plan requiring people follow set rules going work. chance. 

The correct plan always **assume** people comply, work there. Ontario well. drank flavor aid, want well. voluntarily, they'll try make you. simple since legal ground it. can't even restrict travel different regions Sweden, since constitution guarantees right travel freely within borders. That’s pretty extreme  prerogative. ever specifying El Paso Police Chief. Sheriff part discussion previous thread. Doug Ford exactly thing. still good chunk population opts get it, allowing us reduce number serious cases deaths enough full reopening. pains much. family members staying us work based United States I'm completely stable. I've basically told them. 

Don't worry work, life, etc. best now. move forward leave horrible disease behind.

We've playing fire since April since operating rooms hospitals. Tired hearing increased Covid cases, decreased hospital beds, top potential everyone household outright getting someone household helping save lives.

This could end year turn disease partisan issue. Bunch fucking assholes. immunity news keeps getting better better better

If vaccines help immune system recognize coronavirus clearly long term immunity. think year moving watching Tennessee Titans piss away another season stands Nissan stadium approach normalcy  masks anything positive. mask compliance ploy; 8 months realized this? droplets go evaporate Covid linger days? 

Comply once, easy comply again. ""Wear mask, good. Give us guns, good. Spend 6 months driving downtown permission build deck backyard, good. Equality, everyone shares wealth, wealth owned government, good"".

Little little give away rights, unwillingly, unknowingly. TRUE lockdown! would require loss water, loss electricity.. mean, LITERALLY turning world graveyard. is, ironically, obscene ""death-inducing"" thinking called ""save grandmother"" crowd. 

You act like nobody hunkered kept distance, blame broke rules plans work. full Ifs Ands Buts; none enough contain situation built purely impossible hypotheticals. Already happening, let burn folks every thread days. realistic China Vietnam, neither Island countries. I've saying Europe Canada weeks future while.

Goddamnit can't guys give us hopeful prediction! Greetings Europeans; tell us bad gets eventually, government probably proceed flop hard end roughly spot :p give tax dollars pay school back. Scroll there's plenty, aunt passed away cancer past day. accountant might able tell afford it. arent nearly witty think lol shit Sherlock, what's next? water wet??? Nope, yet.

Iirc coronavirus mutates quarter rate influenza genome that’s twice large. (Also influenza segmented rna mixed matched, coronaviruses dont)

Part making flu vaccine year guessing segments prevalent.

So far haven’t found changes would lessen vaccine efficacy D614G variant (or strain indeed strain) common throughout world vaccine trials tested it. Prader Willi extreme example would two entirely separate statistics. Hundreds thousands? Dude talking ass, straight up. know bunch kiwis, NZ abroad. Every one beyond thankful quarantine measures. None ones abroad ""suffering"", overly dramatic way put it. abroad choice, return home time want.

Just look election results. 10% country (hundreds thousands words) overseas suffering, families suffering, incumbent party win absolute fucking landslide?

 


I'll tell how, kiwis happy government response know fuck talking about. Lose fox news talking points look like even tool. Comparing positive testing rates foolish metric universal testing strategy. states schools employers, even, testing everyone weekly. states people getting tests think they'd exposed. Clearly latter higher positive percentages. Sounds like massive class action lawsuits. put infected student back dorms tell anyone? sounds like neglegent homicide anyone dies Studies also show masks even work surgical settings. controlled studies show masks actually work real world. said wear mask anti masker. Full herd immunity may happen 20% still obviously effect. Ro 1.1 20% people immune, Reffective .9 much easier control 1% US military involved power? survive without working weeks? deployed overseas wouldnt problem would they?? I’m disappointed haven’t heard premier step say federal government leaving island backing financially.

What? large circle friends know anyone died think ridiculous something kills .00001% (or ridiculous number) people. surreal disturbing. even know long term issues Fox address it. sure that. Sheriff's department constables begun citing El Paso businesses already. good news ? Doesn’t mean would need multiple vaccinations ? Potentially, think data come vaccines approved related this. probably depend sterilizing vaccines are. 

I’m assuming really vulnerable people can’t vaccinated may need shelter bit vaccine rollout, level local infection controlled. Mask mandates everywhere, months. Use head. No. Fucking. Shit. someone suprised? US bad job change leader. europe bad second wave, even germany. can't emagine next month America...so sad see. would much easier look countries got infected leader still closes eyes problem. everytime covid media jealous time media. virus steals time tell poeple lies great good job doing. really hopeing guys get change chance get back feet. ✌🏻😷 

2nd time way around simply persuasive. 

Based rational political ambition theory, president 1st term likely enact popular policies secure 2nd term. According theory, Trump combating COVID-19 tooth nail. would base support (actually they'd support regardless does), many Liberals would well. effective COVID-19 campaign could yield landslide victory. 

Conversely, theory suggests president likely enact idiosyncratic policies 2nd term. makes total sense because... care electorate? Whether good job not, like get elected again. 

This theory assumes politicians behave way primary impetus remain office. Without possibility office, politicians guided personal political interests. iron-clad, generally pretty persuasive. 

I suspect Trump's ""swan song"" would even controversial. It'd last bullet; he'd go ""make count."" la little faith ""right"" thing. Idaho’s hospitals full, send patients states like Oregon Washington. Fuck Idaho.  Burnout real thing. happens, there's collapse efficacy empathy. terrible thing burn out, yet way US organizes workplaces, benefits, vacation time, sick time, family leave, that's really expected outcome. like it? Get another job. UK, tip.

Facts longer matter.

There narrative. pick side. fools believe headline suggests. end up, due Hitlerian approach coming top. really can't trust Chinese sources, thought well established. ""A total **38,359** people 1.06% took part tested positive must quarantine, Matovic told news conference. ""

Not 8,359. mean shit copy paste? right. one job, op :( hate kids, too. least explain one day mask, though — mom dad right thing protect us others, even though everyone else it. 

Ugh I’m ready over. cool, 50 years herd immunity! Yup, notified contact covid positive literally cannot stop working right quarantine. I’ll getting test soon possible it’s positive I’m fucked. Probably face masks too. Ontario slightly better mini-trump surprisingly prudent things... compared mini-trumps govern Canadian provinces many US states, course. He's still populist though, he's back screwing nurses teachers. Im also reading stats literally show average human near risk reinfection don’t want act like is. stats literally back up. nothing “character development” LOL. anything believe Iran China representing deaths/cases representing. would foolish trust autocratic nations information this, use baseline guess it’s fraction truth. INSERT LARGE LETTERED REPETICIAN POST anyone know specificity antigen tests? hope 99.9%. 99% specificity, would expect 1% positives chance alone. Keto terrible you, bad choice. There’s always going reason something. concerns though fact people still taking virus serious. could potentially mean far over. Right simply unable access entire damage caused date.

The work provides welcome dose optimism Sars-CoV2 infection (and immunisation?) induce robust sustained protective immune response, although yet prove immunity infections require longer-term surveillance larger cohorts.” Made reservations go eat anniversary last month. Tried two restaurants. second time we've eaten since Valentine's day. (The first sidewalk rather decent place atmosphere ruined cars blasting stereos homeless person trying sell ""art"")

I asked first outdoor dining area heated. said no, could outdoor dining inside.

The second heated outdoor dining...it inside event tent. walls kept constant fresh air flow...but turn heat till leaving like 45 night freezing whole time.

I'm eat indoors restaurant places gotta get shit together. Eating important us, mind take really want support small local restaurants. dead inside capitalism Statistically least million Americans die. lot companies testing too, means dont goverment one. restrictions scale compliance people. Lol condescending said? Asked simple question gave logical explanation? Man, social media really fucking us. lot screwups happened early weeks months. Like recommending masks. Even understand likely reason (keep public panic-buying and/or stealing PPE hospitals), hurt credibility months later reversed direction.

Closing land borders politically impossible US board. Thankfully someone talked sense Trump March (a right-wing pundit believe) closing coordinated. remains seen whether could even continue locking casual land crossings US stops bothering reciprocal closings... Especially since *flights* US Canada still allowed.

Edit add: CERB relief program done properly. glitches like large scale implementation, emphasized getting money (up $2000, roughly $1500USD) every month people claimed need it, without lot up-front checks, would auditing accountability later. Compare contrast US' joke relief program, single $1200 payment contingent first verifying people actually needed it. local REWE (German chain supermarket) lady hand treats kids came costumes. wore plague doctor mask leather outfit together plateau boots - could also normal clubbing attire Berlin. :D Really cool costume, though, kids seemed afraid. really surreal see slightly leathery plague doctor standing basket treats normal evening shoppers loading pasta packages onto conveyor.

Right. blame also trying get information short timeframe air.

If wanted real conversation topics, we’d force presidential candidates debates last 3-4 hours break halfway through. really see given thought various issues articulated points. added benefit actually say things camera, put political ads post something campaign website might do. 

The current debate format leads shit like BUILT CAGES JOE! LOL. 1. Masks prevent coronavirus
2. Masks eliminate need social distancing
3. god Fauci wrote peer reviewed article majority deaths spanish flu pandemic actually bacterial pneumonia caused masks
4. Masks create false sense security, people masks large gatherings like protests shoulder shoulder think okay masks make invicible covid Nope It’s like talking bunch rebellious toddlers: CAN’T NICE THINGS, KIDS! herd immunity bad. number people must infected insane. Literally millions Americans die, example. Plus shown last Apologies, thought meant food comes restaurant. yes, still give money delivery person (they put food somewhere) believe taken advantage employer, else order restaurant citing poor treatment employees. part solution bother complaining. Use /s tag “We don’t call outs.”

I'm fucking glad food service industry. Played game 5 years, more. bullshit? fully understand I'm screaming void, here. 8 months (NYC metro) people still fucking ridiculous. Take action context leader person would ridiculed locked looney bin. Unfortunately feel like America's stupidity contagious (see there). seems like wanted to. That’s point though, talk, media speculation, Internet social media chatter. I’m saying take vaccine poof, covid gone.. but, won’t know anything final data released approval. use worrying something hasn’t happened yet. Hang parents ""schooled"". Pasco, FL. seeing spike cases. vast majority children exposed, parents, bear brunt it. 

While children rarely seem effected, parents fatigue, muscle joint aches, nausea, lost taste smell, sore throats, cough, fever, trouble breathing, headaches last weeks, etc. 

We midst community spread. sheer numbers rising. Yesterday clinic doubled cases we've seen previous days week. spread exponential. 

Oh. forget church. Yesterday made aware large-scale spreader threat. Hopefully effected many people, could bad. big takeaway pandemic. coming unless proper lockdown actions taken. 
Please safe really deadliness—it's long-term effects curtail people's health, even never show symptoms infected.

A giant chunk nation suffering permanent damage lungs, brain, and/or heart nothing glib about. worth lockdown (which, again, would take weeks committed clear governance subject like nations did) avoid wholesale weakening country, young old. like French them, they’ll go lockdowns within week two.
It’s hard decision lesson clear; earlier act it’s effective, yet governments still wait last possible moment.  honestly doubt cities let things closed, however. need tax money business owners need means survive live. likely demand reason supply point. copy-paste article. title. Call stupid thought already positive phase 1 data vaccine candidates?. misinterpret past posts particular vaccine candidate published phase 1 data? too- far im even remotely shaken give luxuries year. Yep. call people past blaming others working unsafe environments. else supposed do, become homeless? Going Chinese example: Two-three week total lockdown heavily affected areas, masks, regular testing entire population mandatory isolation remaining found sick. skimp first step emphasize last two more, Korea; can't afford last two, double first, Vietnam. we're lucky enough island, NZ Australia, last two might end that's needed.

Total economic damage: Severe. China lost 4-5% total annual GDP growth. Everyone else negatives.

Costs inaction: Well, we're seeing right less. Economic damage cry uncle; care economy keeps getting F-ed.

Additional risk: Reports covid infects animals. Need confirmation can't reinfect us. can, may forced targeted extermination program animals; stuck world permanent track/trace/quarantine get good vaccine.

Silver lining: Major chance accidentally wipe many common diseases exact time this.

I see evidence one full year total lockdown needed actually impose real lockdown. Unfortunately, step also impossible, west never stand it; many places Earth straight state capacity it. (TBH; beginning think west state capacity either.) 

So yes, literally impossible; simply hope coordinating anyone everyone Earth collective three-week plan. would require one year's worth lockdowns. Hi, paywalled can't view it. post transcript original study? latter applicable, can't tell. showing symptoms mean it. Could also asymptomatic nice try buddy. Great red herring! I'm worried virus. save energy that, histrionics. bring /r/coronavirus, course. agree. remeber started italy really bad saw video someone walking ICU everyone weird bubble things thier heads heard beeps going constantly. pretty terrible. accurate headline would “Contact tracing increasingly unrealistic COVID community spread broadens” something like that.

Exactly. virus everywhere, even stringent precautions reduce chance get it, completely prevent it. asking me, exactly? live Washington state. lot nurses furloughed/laid here. hospitals verge bankruptcy ""customers"" sent everyone dying home last 4 months clear space Covid patients. never came. hospitals slowly opening back elective procedures surgeries. hospitals never overwhelmed. folks Ireland might disagree.

 Covid-19: Level 5 lockdown '***pre-emptive***' strike bring virus Yes we're talking government lives little world reality decide fuck anyone says they're wrong. health minister literally went doctor's drive way screamed meme Dr shared Facebook. Thanks. acknowledge provincial population density tell whole story, think important thing note.

There handful US states smaller cities less overall population density NS suffering large outbreaks virus, low case numbers definitely given. certainly agree must continue vigilant keep cases low though. don’t know I’m sorry. Hope okay. healthy default trusting article like this. 

This particular one looks pretty robust though. worst could really say cherry-picked headline data bit, likely 98.5% TP asymptomatic patients rather 100%. 

I'd interested hear criticisms reading methods Table I. Unless literally welding people homes tearing roads no, adopt China model.

I don’t think anyone needs resort China’s methods. Fast accurate testing contract tracing well mandatory quarantines new arrivals mask wearing needed. Yeah, even boasting they’re going something like wear mask past certain date it’s soooo difficult. Haha, crusty UK slang? Thinking bringing US plenty could labeled “crusty” means think means. Yeah profit really drinks, we're getting takeout.

Dine-in I'm getting least couple craft beers missus gets glass two wine, sharing bottle.

Takeout...I'm stopping packie. fucking arrogant tell dude he's presenting false bullshit choices nothing arrogance offer. grow fuck learn conversation actual meat instead getting childish jollies insulting others. test need perfect useful. needs good enough. 

The virtue test cheaply easily self-administered without taking medical professional's time — and every test provides training data algorithm.

Will false positives? course. like AI ""looking"" radiology scans, extremely effective identifying prioritizing individuals need tested. 

P.S. Every COVID test imperfect, including nasal swabs. swab deep enough, swab coated mucus easy miss tell-tale RNA. Failure self isolate China? Thanks Swedes much different health care system U.S. Got it. point comment cunty vibe. Bullshit. New Zealand without resorting China model. Taiwan South Korea. I'm saying wrong, can't find 7 day world data anywhere time enter excel calculate myself, according currently number 1 world daily confirmed cases per million inhabitants (it appears using yesterdays  origin covid-19 whole point. one super powers, situation looks like global coup west. safe you’re bubble household members, isn’t good way get social needs met. don’t understand desperately need eat outside homes isn’t friends family don’t live us. Seriously, people- stay home now. Dining rooms even allowed remain open areas widespread infections... especially since STILL don’t anywhere near enough access testing. covid high risk group

Being covid low risk group, would nice see guys better protected. doesn’t take account appropriate context. American’s experience vaccines get particular disease(smallpox, chickenpox, etc.) literally never worry catching disease. Secondly, government leaders going tv framing vaccine perfect solution. Even scientifically literate society can’t expect everyone depth knowledge vaccine efficacy rates, look sources information average person relying upon. wonder area, yeah, seems supermarket management getting free reign instead limiting capacity. guess positivity rates go might people line outside stores again. Lolz like re-reading march here. hilarity ensues, pendulum tips back anti-viruses-are-real folks. 


It's like watching humanity learn nothing, instead 100 year scale, 6 month scale. MASKS NECESSARY. SOCIAL DISTANCING COUNTS!
MASKS FALSE SECURITY.  “Disaster response” 
Their death toll like 5700 70% care home long left live.
By European standards that’s way disaster (comparing Norway doesn’t make disaster) point making? Governments failed provide support necessary people voluntarily self-isolate. covering failure authoritarian lockdowns. No. job present infinite scenarios judge scared.
  
You wrong. end. 
 
Grow fuck up. think proof's going pudding - detectable T-cells may lower actual T-cells sufficient mount immune response, final answer going actual reinfection rates. annual thing, still going see improved immune response whatever memory cells remain. well-designed vaccine theoretically could well exceed immunity get infection. US mostly “herd immunity” unannounced without healthcare support system behind. dogs AI Algorithm think would better screening people now. odd. I'm thinking least north much reason lower temperatures moist weather mean lot people stay inside many running noses etc.  fawk first statement assumes 100% vaccinate elderly unrealistic. 

You say ""my level risk"" heart issue. seem concerned safety at-risk population even though risk EXTREMELY low. 

You say ""it’s less dangerous car ride"" look actual numbers, risk getting car WAY higher vaccine injury. may seem less dangerous due exposure situation sincerely ask reconsider position make logical rational decision based actual risks involved protect vunerable. anyone saying vaccine would eradicate virus, ones moving goalpost close (or making goalpost minds). Vaccines simply that; every disease vaccines still exists societies around world, effectiveness confer longer immunity thus lower infection rates. Seriously, fuck trying blame people. bullshit trying blame consumers corporations fucking environment. 

The self-isolation fails government failed make self-isolation feasible. Recommending masks one worst things could’ve done — even right reason. wish said “wear literally anything mask face get made hospitals, please still wear something.” hmm. aspirin is. Yeah, United States implemented universal basic income unemployment system broke. could given money normal people instead billionaires REITs. many people suffering. Yup, I’m sure people expecting cure created? Mandated self isolation year ????. go outside get thrown forced isolation until...????? I'm assuming countries common locked quickly first time kept numbers low there. lock fast enough. 

And believe least second lock downs like now. Yup, I've asking girlfriend periodically I'm crazy one I'm seeing previously-cautious friends starting act like nothing going on. Going sit restaurants, breweries, vineyards, weddings, etc.

It's insanity. know they're smart people, like watching extroverts killing they're incapable staying cautious longer month. Hey pretty good takes sub need global lockdown like 6 weeks allow family spread well. includes getting food, going hospital etc. There's chance could gone away people need food. decide getting food okay, there's many vectors spread. it’s not, it’s failure government provide free fast testing, tf expect people self isolate don’t even know it? heard asymptomatic patients? Grocery stores. Restaurants 30% cap area, yet grocery stores jam packed. not. That's exactly said, response /u/wrongsaladbitch. I'm familiar restaurant, patio /u/creept suggested definitely outdoors. sucks. still live home, risk getting evicted, quarantining since march. became unemployed 3 years ago, struggled find stable job started fulltime course, took year. started 2 month internship company, happy me, got 6 month contract give full contract least duration internship. state supported internship, legal minimum wage. sucked, 2 months left I'd earn least decent amount money (easily 600 monthly increase). *Poof* - 2 months early contract got stopped left 1/3 minimum wage due unemployment. 
 
Now state ass get job, I'm like ""you know there's pandemic right?"", want work, want treated human pandemic. want end, going end soon everyone packed schools, factories, whatever. never got stimulus (probably I'm US) whatever, never got % loan loan get % off. boss still plans hire everything settles, long since money. colleagues work 2 days week since march get % loan. 2 months away that... It, fucking, sucks. really get job market competitive without factory work? studied hard 2 years get thrown away greedy incompetent governments? Nah, I'll wait. They're probably run testing kits... Anyone else found hard follow title first attempts?? Vaccines work natural infections. Apples oranges. Sweden taking precautions. They're still few. excuse Sweden's disaster response March. Currently reading first one. It’s brilliant Back early September, talked going outdoor mall states corona sub someone, children, said ""ummm get 3 month olds wear mask"" said kids young dont need masks basically said terrible parent. 🙄 I've learned ignore weirdos. ~Meanwhile California~

We've masked shut 7 months going anywhere. Better nothing though guess. Yep, circulated air powerful air filters. say risk free also don’t agree people saying awful person fly. people thinking, going vacation Spain last summer? ""leadership"" problem. 

We still closed borders second wave either. however, leadership problem. Ive working restaurants pandemic, one who's gonna enforce rules except customers makes difference. 

One place worked, customer called health board lot ppl going masks, distancing, letting kids run etc. video evidence 

My boss knows ppl board argued, ""well want risk anything stay home"" end that. kind everywhere rn balancing act lives economy.

There's argument made go lock fast enough. see much argument either constant lockdown never lockdown. overwhelming ICU's keeping economy going best can. people bored unable cope mental health disorder get socialize. understand it, stupid want spend time needed either.

I agree this. minority selfish idiots make harder us. can’t remember where, data this, maybe clinical observations alone, coming China back intense Wuhan. aerosol transmission, many features make sense simple virus.
Of course studies valuable, terms knowing we’re dealing with, haven’t really seen something new since March early April. anyplace western hemisphere succeeded?

Atlantic Canada done pretty well [""Atlantic far Collectively, region lowest infection rates world, far better developed New Brunswick Prince Edward Island, rates around 25 36 cases per 100,000 people, respectively, better New Zealand, held model success controlling without sacrifices, however. months, despite low rate infections, almost everyone travelling outside Atlantic Canada required self-isolate 14 days upon entry – rule particularly hard tourism hospitality two-week quarantine rule brought provinces themselves, addition federal rule requires visitors outside Canada self-isolate. part country, exception Northwest Territories, taken quarantine restrictions far. one throw huge party? I'm asking maybe apply knowledge coronapocalypse. preventative measure work 100% time useless? NJ enough immune people avoid major second wave overwhelms hospitals. big deal all. don’t think that’s even scenario worth discussing, multiple vaccine candidates good data behind them. vaccine summer 2021, question many people gotten then. I’m NW suburbs well. family careful never eat indoors restaurant, always wear masks we’re public place, social gatherings we’ve small, outdoors, social distanced. Unfortunately, I’ve seen heard, people aren’t like this, flat ignore rules mask compliance stores. sister bunch stories cheerleading friends meeting careful, even one family member COVID, luckily part of. thought iMuNiTy know joking, friend who's sex worker CO go, lot peers desperate need money. Clubs bars shut down, clients isolating spending money, sex workers can't exactly apply unemployment. really bad them. Like, real bad. literally carry permanent health consequences survive. let guess: real facts you? chance dying worth avoiding. selfish asshole. Anecdotal, still encouraging. Seems like lot also fact lot states, especially midwest, essentially first waves. Localities tend respond urgency it’s longer far threat. I'm 🐒. I'm hoooman. Probably reasonable. transmissions planes, mostly mask requirements.

I'd vastly prefer kept middle seats open, legroom squick factor, masked properly many events traceable middle seats populated. Due ventilation design, data shows plane actually relatively safe place be, even shoulder shoulder.

I'd say though business decision, extra seats sell better worth optics making move cases explode worldwide.  big problem. avoided getting tested add case, avoid going hospital? I'm sorry. terrible many people guilted putting lives risk holiday season.

We need teach next generation boundaries still respected. Boomers raised ton guilt, shame, emotional manipulation parents hard time boundaries still turn around. 

Reddit often overreaction this, recommending people never anything want regarding family. there's middle ground. us want good relationship. 


Good luck family holiday season. hope father recovers soon. think I'll keep practicing, physician friend mine also mask outdoors. We're aware data subsequent research moved panicky public. 

Curious, living? something tech? Tech people panicky people there. Probably something able work home literally able seal public bypass pandemic earning full income. point? course cases increase stop taking precautions.

What expecting, magic?

Just waiting numbers reach arbitrary point stop taking precautions without implimenting robust controls like testing, tracing, enforcement makes sense.

Additionally, level numbers far lower U.S. took things seriously pressed advantage summer.

That far better shape U.S. still. shown immunity last, antibodies stay blood forever? body uses memory cells produce antibodies virus re-encountered, continually produce antibodies every virus ever encountered.  look comments thread, you’ll see people saying opposite. It’s offered everyone year, usually not. user never expressly says it’s usually different. Based comments /r/askeurope, seems norm: it’s recommended offered everyone. I’ve heard people talk I’ve never seen any. Something air circulates filtered? plague doctor. That's masks called.  money businesses allows keep paying employees, Even shut down,

but predicated ACTUALLY FUCKING THAT. 

we need middleman lmfao. bought Lamborghini getting $4 million PPP loan. faces fraud like rampant.

they're taking loans pocketing cash ""paying"" family instead real employees. First thing, actual paper/research (which conducted economists) they’re reporting hasn’t submitted peer review, it’s literally printed first page it. It’s nothing r/theydidthemath post PDF written people completely different domain. could completely valid it’s scrutinized actual review board, shouldn’t take proof anything.

Second, doesn’t say think it’s saying. paper conclude virus transmission doesn’t occur protests. conclude since mass gatherings seen unsafe/giant disease vectors non-protesters, doubled social distancing efforts avoiding areas taking place entirely. sounds little far-fetched, source this? like 3 years form course, soon people’s vaccines start kicking see improvements situation far Korea goes, it’s also possible due significantly lower obesity USA large number asymptomatic cases never picked testing. 

The USA’s complacency regarding obesity made us vulnerable number diseases vastly worse prognosis obesity factor. Eg: covid, cancer, heart disease. basement dwellers trying get higher standard, end looking foolish. (and especially we, U.S.) chance things right way failed. looks like used mix ResNET 50 layers, also four meaningful features. features used taken previous study meant detect Alzheimer's based cough. used transfer learning adjust COVID model. 

Those four features essentially derived ML though, direct interpretation. However, trained indicative four things:

1. Muscular Degradation 
2. Sentiment  
3. Vocal Cords 
4. Respiratory tract probably get much better explanation look references, I'm giving search haha I'm confused still...it sounds like saying person symptoms all, need get test they're assumed COVID? I'm probably missing something here. initially infected start year, mildly symptomatic. multiple long term exposures since issue. need read written respond instead letting tribalism rule life dude.  worried surviving civil war 2.0. mean vaccine help reduce spread? thanks. 

You vile want facts don’t lie. saying mid 2021-2022 it. 

There's going lingering issues outbreaks crowd reductions think expect much better next Christmas. 

If definition ""over"" completely 100% back 100% normal, that's different standard, know. I'm happy low rates transmission area. Source ? can't take this. I'm tired. lost everything.... Thank providing information.

What difference RRT-PCR RT-PCR? actual answer, ""it mutates less deadly"" wishful thinking.

It may, may not. random.

Smallpox never did. Polio never did. flu may likely population immunity reduced severity (just like getting flu shot reduces illness severity catch it) words like US, implement adequate test/trace/isolate programme... It’s sad completely given identifying source outbreak. going come back bite us 10-20 years China reopens wet markets. message necessarily people. governments enforce, encourage lead constituents properly.

Most Western countries warnings: chose disregard it, would costly. costed ignore it. Possibly. There's plenty homeless folk could roof heads. Hey! go homeless could move in! Perfect!

Jermacide's always option starve enough. I'd recommend though. answer you’d live like forever then? covid never eradicated you’ll keep like keep cursing not?

I’m 100% going restricting time public especially going restricting time enjoying holidays getting together friends. That’s life about, won’t stop living highly survivable disease. 

I’ve know couple people overcome various forms OCD cognitive based therapy I’ve heard help health anxiety (covid phobia anxiety feel). Could useful case? There's still going people making claim, I've seen. actual immunity, we'd see WAY reinfections year. makes logical sense. Ive traveled world, ""here"" ""over there"". ""over there"" know little people survive on. much states consider essential really isn't. mean usa shut everything needed survive. Couldve rationed food shut stores. People actually required stay home unless job life death people(snow plow would needed ldo, thats job contact people). course would require politicians put public safety re-election. Would Americans willing ""suffer"" 2 weeks save 150000++ lives? US? Europe aweful Trolls disaster response yes. Nobody cares sick attitude elderly. could save lives simple precautions. excuse letting die. literally killing them. criminals locked safety equipment elderly care workers use need punished. They're getting away covering them.

It's disaster standards. Sweden one worst countries world. Despite best circumstances. Practically Island nation, notified advance, many work home.

Absolutely excuse worse Norway. Denmark. Finland. Iceland. Yes, make disaster. island nation standards. Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iceland. Sweden awful, incompetent, terrible cruel.  Yeah, US locked like Italy France Netherlands, great right now. used way, used actually protect everyone? 

What ""that way""?

There lots despots throughout history who've done lots good people governed.

Romans liked emperor Augustus. keen Nero. Covid takes 2 weeks fully get over.

The number Americans many paid sick days few.

Some companies pay tested Covid + false negative rates far high. spent 5 months actual lockdown (2 hr week go permit) can't blame rule breakers anymore.  wonDer right mind JeopaRdizes sensitive data..? he's right though...masks work only. hard core lock thought seen governments pre-ordering candidates massive doses getting produced advance even trials still underway hopes one work... idea would trials done December know one two work already hundreds millions doses ready, real hurdle logistics deployment. Could wrong that... Infection fatality rate need keep 25%. Could raise 50 even 80% long still markers stand line, importantly people continue wear masks. That's 2021 going look like, probably 2022 beyond well. local news Columbus Ohio story one restaurants put domes rooftop restaurant. remodeled bit, ran electrical flooring made sure domes properly bolted installed. lights strung inside domes (about 50% bigger pictured here) table, 4 6 chairs, lounge chair (if wanted) side table style infrared heaters. also showed employees wiping tables handheld sanitizing misting thing hit walls, ceiling, floor soft surfaces. also upscaled restaurant renting domes $100 hour (waved tab equaled least $100). made sure say always hours time next customer make sure dome properly sanitized. 

Sorry can't find Video right now. Time tell approach work. sure price friendly restaurants thing. could outdoor dining inside

... tell people bankrupt Idk I’m doctor, trying make logical connection discussion purposes. completely agree sentiment, think letter law (mind lawyer) says differently. 

Without looking would guess internment camps justified control immigration, federal power (probably grossly misused natural citizen immigrant doubt interned born US). defending policy even Constitutional, still stupid cruel. reason uphold checks Constitution. 

The 10th Amendment says Federal Government *only* allowed Constitution. power creep, including pretty silly arguments support creep? Yes. even war similar emergencies, need cap Federal/Presidential powers, lest president declare war St. Martin invoke war powers. Think current administration could unchecked Constitution instead ignoring Constitution. nasal cavity could still spread talking/sneezing/coughing may reduce amount virus that's transmitted. Oh get hell outta here. wouldn’t said flu despite flu almost equal IFR college aged kids. schools
 asia little kids wear masks Yep sucks. could functional life assholes would wear simple mask time go angry person trying make point. sure point is, there's always least one person making it. getting rolled Poland sure getting tested first Poland seen big spike last weeks coming time. What? could swear Tegnell said reason strategy worked consistent change time...  boy, see lot people online turn complete jerks year. unfollowed memes, dankmemes, facepalm, funny subreddits becaus that. failed properly warn people consistently gave politically best advice best advice people. failed horribly thier purpose. truly unable vaccinate everyone 100% rate. possible due many factors. 

In example, protecting grandmother vaccinated, protecting grandmother grocery store get vaccine whatever reason (which inevitability). able 100% vaccinate at-risk population would completely right thinking ""why would anyone else need it?"" Unfortunately, something happens reality. Wut? many examples dictators declaring “temporary” state emergency curtails freedoms 20-30 years. one location. I'm upper middle class, part reasoning really strongly distancing specifically try keep must keep working safe. Exactly. Ive given drinking bars. livelihood. different. whats true death rate make decent guess total number cases? Yup; I'm voting straight Democrat, wearing mask pretty much everywhere. I've cut almost every single activity outside house used enjoy. However limit I'm willing sacrifice family. Giving 18th months life child's life limit. wait majority people want vaccine get it, that's us. We're rolling dice living life again. care lot parents, care even child indefinitely something accept. try hard save shows lack faith God. Anyone really religious community able corroborate.

To concerned means ""panicking"" trust God. There's actually stigma this.

I watch gardening channel YouTube guy channel said something stay home order April ""we panic believe Jesus Christ.""

How fight something people believe almost goes faith try stop it? Sure maybe wear masks store congregation want show worried believe Jesus Christ. 

I'm talking catholics cities. I'm talking christians Idaho, Texas, like *real ass Christians* church primary social group everyone neighborhood also religion might even go church. 

Tough times. size groups talking about?

I started seeing family recently (6-8 people regularly screened generally cautious exposure). I'm also county everyone wears masks positive cases relatively flat couple months. strict? yeah, lot hippies/“wooks.” friends fit criteria fortunately brains aren’t fried point something like this. yet still listening he'll say. Waiting comeuppance, redemption, scripted Disney/WWF storybook ending. hold breath. OK listen people matter. get far, yes. didn't, course, read actually wrote, you? Yea saw happening. they? UK people liberal? time back Redditors praising UK people baby balloon. Testing step one. testing, positive cases need quarantine. one seems study compliance rates regarding quarantine. many anecdotal observational reports people following quarantine guidelines, understanding it, sometimes, pressured work positive. either increase voluntary compliance quarantine, enforcement, virus spread. Sorry embarrassed wrong . really. test runs lung fluids accurate, can't use routine testing invasive. 

I heard saliva tests may better, seen research evidence.

The high rate false negatives reason people still asked self-isolate even test negative. negative result mean virus free, means swab failed find it.  everybody polarized subject?

Good question. 

The really stupid thing overlap anti-mask folks anti-lockdown folks. 

Um, masks help allow lockdowns lift. That’s fair mean something like covid scale states need support bc telling 50 individual states whatever isn’t solid plan success imo still gotten clear answer big problem hospitals, counties, states release data. reason public seems rely CDC inform them, also trusting them. Plus company needs certain size (I want say 50 people?) apply small business. What’s aim articles like this? Truly? trying tell us life never going back normal? sure city live go check Water St. Brady St. Milwaukee weekends tell look like non covid weekend. Basically news we've waiting for?

or could try respectful, wear masks, social distance. choices dictate route needed. Tell argentina, france, spain etc Agree. health experts seem think living bubble years end practical realistic. Maybe country government actually gives shit people smart. Furthermore, I've months ago, get exposed again, T-cells hard work getting rid could contagious. Even though chances getting sick tiny, way treat people can't really change.   Even lockdown France nearly enough get manageable level daily contagions Maybe mentality people espouse reality ground.  herd immunity transmission slowdown observed subsidized 20-25% population horrified carelessness others either due vulnerabilities firsthand loss. Movies already open. Plays could long people wear masks. Measures reduced going away. Sorry upsets I’m genuinely confused, saying can’t 100% vaccinate elderly, viable candidate vaccine? 

So country sensible nation would inoculate elderly sick first. 
So would even take dose? 

So (for example) grandmother vaccinated really care either way don’t get covid drive hospital statistically dangerous covid vaccine injury. 

I’m serious risk vaccinated need bother?  season

No I’m wearing mask three months every year rest life. school open back person class Fall 2021 earliest. 

Yep. Good see someone seeing things clearly. Like stinky hippy/punk types 75% effective, know how, exactly? could Dec 31? vaccine that's suppressed could 7.8 Billion doses ready, deployed enough time passed without outbreak Dec 31, 2020? thought government restrictions ending, fact pandemic probably going rage 12-18 months.

They thought government would actually control virus instead letting rage.

I'm infectious disease expert saw shit show coming US since February. *still* thought we'd better position thought government least going *try* let get bad. Totally this. Drones deliver dinner , groceries, Amazon packages. crazy. Essential workers certainly spread infection household (who could spread others) much smaller conduits spread virus. one infected person possible exposing less 5, vs. one person possibly exposing tens hundreds.

Plus, I'd bargain people share household essential worker would likely follow guidelines quarantine positive infectious status determined, nature pandemic always directly impacting them. work sign sheet paper, tests temp checks (despite telling customers do), half people even wear masks customers leave 🤷‍♀️ small office big business. It’s called common sense. Cold antibodies don’t last forever. last couple years. anyone whether Boris hospital yet? ...which supports point.

He might infected people properly isolated isolates protect others. What? China? Try watching 5 moving dots small computer screen, watching 25 much larger one. becomes much difficult, no? It’s essentially principle, factors = harder. working job year US eligible FMLA leave.

There whole list conditions need met qualify FMLA. two biggest one year employment employer certain number people within certain radius primary work location. even work large employer, may qualify work branch office tra elling sales. also exceptions mission critical employees. Yup, covid positive person house, anyone else house, even behind closed doors, constantly exposed person covid longer house, free contagious disease. What? People intelligence acting like it, people lacking intelligence acting like it? Say so. FFS, article healthy people isolating 3+ months. 2-week isolation people recent positive Covid test, contacts. isolation failing due lack financial support serious enforcement.

It's simple stuff could make big difference. implies debate population-wide lockdowns crime problem, debating whether nuke neighborhood ignored tried sending police. Didn’t say drunk mma podcast friends though? That’s talking nonsense. He’s always stance wear masks end lockdown soon possible stimulus!!!!! depends. situation desparate enough people know able get treatment case accidents, likely adhere anything they're asked, probably more. principle yes, still cannot shout ""fire"" crowded theater. free harm general public, intersection stuck masks. little less hostile take, human free civilized society cross paths must forced common compromise lives everyday, thats civilization is. 

If dont understand thats exactly masks important part civil society today accept / embrace change ~ look infraction civil liberty part problem cant nice things. Yes Clotting hospitalized patients makes sense since laying bed extended periods plus severe symptoms. treatment recommended severe patients months ago? people still imply good treatments yet treatment studied remdisivir approved fda. Sounds like it’ll make covid general common cold. though point 40 years covid probably evolve enough point it’s 5th member common cold corona viruses. even theory Russian flu 1889 corona virus endemic Coronavirus I’m serious risk vaccinated need bother?

There couple reasons, /u/bassp1aya laid nicely. ones wanted add may wish consider:

-In vulnerable populations elderly immunocompromised, vaccines actually work well groups. person's immune system may react strongly ""supposed"" to, therefore vaccine less effective vulnerable person ""normal"" person. majority population vaccinated important. know 100% case forthcoming covid vaccines, possibility (as example, see flu vaccines vaccinations arouse strong immune reaction immunocompromised/elderly folks).

-Another reason even vulnerable person vaccinated vaccine works well everyone else, vaccine 100% effective. US, minimum threshold approval (I think) 50% efficacy. We'll really well get like 70%. another reason need lot people take vaccine - reduce overall likelihood exposure general.

-Even symptomatic, still vector spread virus. elderly otherwise vulnerable relatives may vaccinated, guarantee (and others) can't still catch due ""not 100% effective"" thing. vaccinated reduces odds asymptomatic spread.

As note - asymptomatic pre-symptomatic spread getting lot attention covid, true flu well. another reason get flu shot even never get sick. still helps protect elderly vulnerable groups preventing unknowing vector disease. “Reopening states like peeing section swimming pool”

*Neil deGrasse Tyson* based study 104 adults working grocery store Boston area May, 

You know, science asked “follow” pretty poor. northern states. Lack PPE, lack hospital beds, lack hospital *workers*, shortage test kits, etc. Basically inability provide adequate care. America millions active cases? took south Australia 3 month hard lockdown 700 cases day (not 70.000)
It’s unrealistic goal  great! source could share? government failed us, question. much blame individuals. People making personal choices go without mask, go parties distancing/masks, make unnecessary trips hobby stores, etc. decisions made individuals themselves, government. Decisions need held accountable for, selfish behavior what's keeping pandemic going.

So yes, I'm blaming individuals. selfish assholes. all, good chunk. i’m sorry, boiling cultural essentialism instead government competency absurd. australia new zealand rooted western tradition country. democratic east asian countries still liberal democracies strong traditions protest. otoh, failures hubei, india, latin america, etc. came authoritarian responses. through-line competency, culture. same, provided full 12 month window, lol.

I’d happy “I visit friends (who aren’t state) without putting community risk”. Group chats healthy replacement social interaction. I’m even extrovert man. I’ve taken half dozen hobbies that’s still same. What's even point keep saying this? COVID-19 Deniers use say lockdowns done. Cope Hope ends "" there's immunity this"" statements. volley, I’m convinced sides working together delay sort financial aid. One pitches idea knowing reject they’ll go back forth, meanwhile months passed they’ve done nothing intention anything. Sympathy checks $300 would even welcomed tennis match. Yes, still infect someone else. 

The hope 1) vaccines decrease impact symptoms, 2) shorten long someone infectious. come back year? Seethe snitch heard stories essential employees super spreader events.

Do think media accurately reporting every contact-tracing result, think might tend go sensational ""50 cases linked wedding"" headline rather ""50 cases linked people shopping"" headline? Also, suppose may constraints contact tracing make easier detect cases coming mass gathering rather grocery store common place? Every time people get complacent, cases shoot roof. shouldn’t reopened prematurely shouldn’t stayed open, shouldn’t sent kids back school, shouldn’t deal stimulus direction federal government. people leadership positions saying shit safe, tons people believe them. won’t comment says people it’s sad situation around started president that’s cronies downplaying global pandemic. they’re still it! China bots incoming downvote oblivion. ""four week"" shutdown Germany begun today Merkel already alluding possible extension spring (that would 5-7 months). salami tactics getting ridiculous. Ah, true. Maybe take 10 years. still happening, seethe  fact additional compensation readily available shows pay us enough anyways. even enough. extra $20 day they're getting still enough miss two weeks. Say make $16 ""compensation"" per hour, paycheck means make $1280 pre tax. miss two weeks covid, missed pay equals 600 hours ""compensation pay."" environment masks fully mandated. bullshit system. Perhaps called whA would muscle back statements. Well, we're talking typical, typically, seasonal coronavirus protective immunity short-lasting. El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego says county struggling find space rising numbers COVID-19 patient According Judge Samaniego, county set fourth mobile morgue unit medical examiner’s office, coronavirus patients dying faster county investigate COVID-19 patients pass away, county investigate whether died coronavirus process takes time, according judge, COVID-19 patients El Paso dying fast medical examiner keep up. Maybe it’s people extracurriculars friends, talk closer classroom. think people also need consider chances low kids die virus, real way knowing kid follow trend, one rare, fatal cases. 

As someone two elementary grade kids, don’t even want risk it. knowing long term effects virus are. Noooo Americans fun stay home unless protest riot noooo fucking morons happy, isnt yall begging for? seem scary actually coming? still see sentiment posts sub. depressing. I've still seeing friends would encourage well. plenty ways hang friends safe way almost mitigate risk transmission.  article:

Only Romania Czech Republic registered Covid-19 deaths per inhabitant. trend continues, 8,000 official victims Christmas
-

Spain added 7,100 coronavirus fatalities official death toll since July. equates 15 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – third-highest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants Europe. Germany, figure 10 times lower, Italy, one-third rate Spain. Portugal (eight), France (nine) Belgium (12) European countries closest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants. What’s more, Spain reported average 150 daily Covid-19 related fatalities last week, making virus leading cause death.

The two European countries higher coronavirus fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants Romania Czech Republic, saw relatively low number deaths first wave pandemic March June. number coronavirus victims must considered care: figure Spain reports European institutions based information Health Ministry, ongoing problems underreporting notification delays. example, Health Ministry’s official death count 30% lower number reported Spain’s regions.

Yet even problems, Spain recorded daily average 150 official coronavirus deaths last week. figure equal deaths caused respiratory illnesses 2019 10 times higher number fatalities caused traffic accidents 1996, one worst years record. rate slow, Spain recorded 8,000 Covid-19 fatalities Christmas. Spain adds victims official toll tested positive coronavirus.

The second wave pandemic hit Europe time. Spain one first affected. France Italy, coronavirus cases began rise two three weeks later. Typically, number fatalities start spike cases, leads hospital admissions later deaths. France Italy trying stop happening new restrictions, former total lockdown, latter closing establishments 6pm. next graphic shows number daily reported coronavirus deaths risen 16 European countries, European average grey.

The epidemiological curve Spain following pattern different countries Europe. August, number coronavirus infections rose quickly territory beginning September, Madrid region highest cumulative number cases continent. France Belgium began report cases, number dropped Madrid plateaued nationally. attributed first round coronavirus restrictions introduced second wave also fear: perhaps alarming data August made Spaniards cautious September. weather may also played role: cold indoor activity behind rise Europe, surprise Spain’s warm weather delayed effects. since October, number hospital admissions deaths spiked: coronavirus cases hospitalizations nearly doubled.

Case fatality rate
-

The first table also shows case fatality ratio rate (CFR) European country since July. represents number deaths confirmed cases. Spain, figure around 0.8% since July. words, every 100 confirmed diagnoses, nearly one person died. CFR Spain slightly higher average. Romania, Bulgaria Hungary worse figures, given likely many coronavirus cases going undetected countries. Spain, however, still long way Germany, CFR 0.4% since July. figures approximation: CFR rise Spain many recently contracted coronavirus infections yet time cause deaths. Covid-19 fatalities also tend reported delays new cases.

It’s also important differentiate case fatality ratio infection fatality ratio (IFR). IFR addresses important question: percentage infected people end losing lives disease? determine figure, one must know many infections detected, asymptomatic gone doctor. Last week, Imperial College London published detailed study estimated IFR high-income countries first wave pandemic. According researchers, figure around 1.1% infections, taking account undetected cases, based seroprevalence studies. study also points IFR flu least 10 times lower, standing less 0.1%, according data United States.
Differences Spain’s regions

The coronavirus fatality rate since July varies greatly region Spain. Aragón hit second wave earlier, outbreaks among seasonal workers July. incidence rate since stabilized, never truly dropped. Meanwhile, number deaths region continued rise. Since July, Aragón worst fatality rate per population Spain’s 17 regions: 54 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. nearly double figure Castilla León (32), Madrid (30), La Rioja (29), Navarre (26) Basque Country (23). end spectrum Canary Islands Valencia, fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants four five times lower.

It also important remember official coronavirus death toll reflect entire impact pandemic. firstly due aforementioned problems reporting Covid-19 deaths. extreme case Catalonia: region reported Health Ministry 306 coronavirus deaths confirmed PCR tests since July. represents 20% 1,400 fatalities “suspected” caused Covid-19, figure likely accurate line fatality rate European regions.

The point consider number excess deaths according civil registries. second wave, National Statistics Institute (INE) recorded 13,000 deaths 2019 2010. figure accounts deaths causes, likely include coronavirus fatalities added official toll, well likely rise victims diseases, diagnosed received worse treatment result coronavirus crisis. excess deaths that, attributable Covid-19, likely caused health crisis provoked pandemic. day Fucking absolutely not. huge difference risk take go indoor party unmasked pass someone street sneezes unmasked. 

I don’t think it’s possible actually trace whether someone’s gotten sneeze passerby it’s hysterical think spreads easily vast amounts data show indoors unmasked lots people easiest way get corona models saying happen 10 days. So, 10 days, two choices available: Transfer patients Germany hope triage…. we'll triage. [That means] one bed remaining, two patients. doctors choose one two patients able bed have. That's triage. Usually, done terrorism, war, catastrophes like nuclear explosion. Uhhh literally like every vaccine? Wear masks use better treatment/testing vaccine sure works properly. Otherwise might another ‘social experiment’ like herd immunity one. previous study detailed cases two hairstylists Missouri tested positive SARS-CoV-2 May – around time grocery store workers examined – seemingly pass virus 139 clients saw entered quarantine.

This among many news sources fail report two-thirds hairstylist clients tested.

The results supermarket review surprising.  regularly exposed viral load, matter time high percentage become infected. worst part would taken ONE month fix EVERYONE followed guidelines. fun, would 30 days. 

Now we've got dragged torment, US, certain percentage population selfish idiots. Hazardous pay teachers, class students tending cemeteries, age-appropriate. angers parents, masks seem bad. Yep, 

rather deal either like intelligent peoples.

Both topics politicized weaponized. 

Facts longer matter. FUCKING HOAX!!! west suffer many freedoms

I'll take 3 million US deaths rather running risk becoming anything like hellhole China, thanks. thoughts exactly. Anyone bit logical, critical thinking could've told us this. governments virus control (like US) failed people, paying it. evidence this, better.... show me. know are. average American denial point Sweden example life carry virus willfully ignorant mitigation efforts went Sweden. I'm right you. think initial lockdown part helping scientists understand virus better softening blow medical system. we're point keep somebody like trump alive getting infected think we're okay make major changes we're dealing virus. think restrictions based risk factors. People risk severely/fatally impacted virus going isolate regardless mandatory lockdown. protection efforts aimed them. I'm tired seeing countless people get infected barely feel anything think entire life derailed something benign majority population. I've times suicidal seeing articles they're saying going return normal helping whatsoever. tired forced tyranny pants public. Fuck eyes prudent nature Im free damnit!!

Except masks save lives, theres that.

Also, arguing 'telling makes want more', could childish. Lets allow society run childish tendency grown ups talking go back youtube conspiracy courses. Fucking gardening channel YouTube. Alright sure, that's **Island** Conservative leadership bang job putting Citizens Economy. carne asada bomb yo We're symptoms mild moderate, serious? never absolute individual liberty, would include liberty individuals take away liberty individuals. 

Therefore, it‘s simply question far willing temper individual freedom. 

This one core principles liberalism, much freedom possible, many restrictions necessary. 

Currently, necessary restrict movement higher degree usual. blame article lies people self isolating symptoms contact someone tested positive. governments haven’t helped citizens isolate. That’s snobbery. ""Like"" OMG...

FFS means tolerate 10x higher infection rates hospitals become overwhelmed. exponential spread, that's nearly much headroom sounds. Hey Aus friend... Glad guys managed get things control. first 24-hour period community spread whole country? That's really good news. us US... There's way hell we're going able control things appreciable way winter. Even dump Trump, he's office January 20th... individual states' governors implement control plans. even ones who've taken seriously tried best (like mine Michigan) fought every turn vacuous, mouth-breathing anti-mask wretchlings.

Hope guys stay safe. good god bushfires season, okay?! think government officials media really need stop saying ""we handled COVID crisis like country X"". seems like many countries places gotten virus control trouble soon. decline funding til mandate measures Americans become complacent dishonesty theft government types situations become, “Eh, gonna it” types reactions. much icing cake, begin accept bad bad. It’s sad allow much though, we’ve lost fight back government knows it. They’re taking advantage every scenario right out. somehow think need medicine survive.

But millions jobs vital life limb done. experts say article:

""Provided enough people get one, vaccine may slow pandemic already killed million people worldwide.""


""It’s tempting look first vaccine President Trump does: on-off switch bring back life know it. “As soon it’s given go-ahead, get out, defeat virus,” said September news conference. vaccine experts say prepare instead perplexing, frustrating year.""


“It yet dawned hardly anybody amount complexity chaos confusion happen short months,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, director Vaccine Research Group Mayo Clinic.""

Carl Zimmer, New York Times  think big part done well Australia $1500/ fortnight payments workers and/or jobless. People choose eating/ paying housing getting covid. whole free healthcare thing. Thank soo soooo sooo much this. need this. world needs this&lt;3 spread right info. Go go CDC!!! UPTHESCIENTISTS!!!&lt;3 Virtual socialization replacement close face face socialization. Yeah top. That's 4 degrees separation - test everyone basis, testing every American. Thanks. sounds like good strategy drive infection rate. every state go hell order take seriously (even florida people wear masks pretty well now)

I've got another tab open says parents FL suing schools making kids wear masks. think WTF kids school all? FL hit rock bottom yet. I’m sorry. 

My sister works department zero appointee makes target. hope friend hangs there. situation hard enough healthcare workers.. let alone receive death threats job. Yep, that's I'm saying. would unfair expect responsibility No, elites right. peasantry wrong. stupid understand, peasant. I'm adding bike lanes, investing public transportation, producing cleaner vehicles. One advocate climate friendly world without forcing social distancing masks throats. Making joke connecting persons name Mengele civil. thinking comment deleted. idea helping climate change locking us house forever even long vaccine found? Better ways solve climate change electric cars instead regular gasoline cars big corporations emit alot pollution etc. remember climate change activist calling us locked house. 

Also yes technically covid probably us forever vaccines come get better treatment covid much problem. Pandemics last forever states fire anyone reason, reason all. long they're explicitly employee member group protected federal job discrimination laws, like race, sex, religion, national origin, 40, etc media creating scary headlines like one article pm2.5 surgical masks reusables, really see morons wearing bandanas thinking they're cool mean vaccine meant do? UBI would massive improvement fact would eliminate cost bureaucracy people need apply. Imagine much money could give directly citizens manner. vaccine like putting house fire. eliminate fire fast enough, flammable objects never touched.

The risk never going get vaccine begin with. risk. Even vaccine rolls out, isolate longer rejoining us. Mon Dieu! Yes. general, 80% ones salary. can't speak US, Germany, seems like major outbreaks food processing factories (especially slaughterhouses) pretty regular basis, often cause strict lockdown entire region. would consider food production essential work. least here, ""we need damn lockdowns guys would stop meeting friends"" utter bullshit. examples: Tönnies Rheda-Wiedenbrück, 1500 7000 employees got infected June, even implementing hygiene concept, second (albeit much smaller) outbreak October 80 90 infections. Another Tönnies got 112 600 people infected last month. Even slaughterhouse small town grew (Westfleisch Coesfeld) superspreading event (130 1200). Last Friday, Blömer Fleisch Grimmen shut due 57 118 employees testing positive. ones think top head, googled ""Schlachthof corona"" limited results last month seems October alone, five six meat processing factories shut production partway fully huge chunks employees testing positive. exploitative industries cramp overworked underpaid employees small spaces regard safety probably similar numbers meat industry.    
I'm saying personal responsibility important, OK big wedding slaughterhouses fuck efforts anyway, ridiculous put blame free-time activities population lot cases caused horrible working conditions essential workers. Even sat asses home never met single soul outside workplace grocery shopping, corona would continue spreading. Social distancing effective corporations shown value profit wellbeing entire world get strictly supervised state. They're least attempting to, know much. countries 20-40 age range needs targeted. Generally little difference case numbers two groups. I've seeing postings jobs field Scotland/UK now, knew God trying tell something. fact though, are. amount whining hand wringing change that. no, CAN'T it. shit funny. People dying, families destroyed, homes lost, know need laugh every thread that. 

Please, people, show empathy fellow human beings. Looked Saints gathering...they seemed letting slide. sure lockdown started last week appear really started enforcing anything today. like already know expect. serious? expose anybody high enough dosage (usually extremely high) get reinfected. accomplish? plandemic I'm process trying use 16 years' worth accumulated sick pay take time off. company make easy. prove I'm really sick, chronic diseases without official diagnosis get taken seriously hardly anyone... think medical billing even code long covid yet. stressful expensive mess I'm afraid they'll deny use sick pay. 

But ultimately, felt like already permanent damage pushing hard many months. go leave weeks ago (flma applies, unpaid) even without guarantee money. company care me. worth dying for, that's sure.

I wish quit last year. yeah think that's top, could secondary spread else good get tested regardless Thanks - he’s happy out. get physical therapy rehab surgery hospital able provide end. He’ll get mom sister’s family getting says lot. hospital full. cousin works communications hospital can’t say capacity are. honestly don’t think people care unless know someone it. dad’s sister lamenting shutdowns brother hospital. friends lost healthy family members one college friends fighting WI spouse respirator. It’s flu sadly people lack empathy doesn’t help head GOP makes everything political regarding common sense measures like wearing mask. need new public hygiene initiatives federal level.

It would nice leadership issue. get Hans Franz too? XD absolutely contest this. also go local press it. mean except Russian virologist intentionally re-infected successfully 6 months? No. understood fine. absurd think Sweden can't count single digit COVID deaths quickly that. even two day delay would hard explain. 

In case, apart extremely low death count, another extremely important aspect Sweden's deaths vs. new cases two metrics become completely decoupled. 

Cases surge, deaths remain flat. something amazing going high time gen pop sub acknowledge it. citizens England receive stimulus check monetary aid work lockdown?


I’m painfully unaware things working across pond...just man US, Texas curious. nobody called police? Ffs.  vaccine possibly work risk poor immune systems that’s susceptible covid? 

It’s going global endemic point failures true capitalism society. pulled together months ago, time wasted? Boris Johnson going differently lockdown? like came Thanksgiving last year. one brought weird jello-marshmallow thing? ""Cloaked secrecy""? Drama much?  interesting. NJ three months one wore masks outdoors all. going stores. Welcome club. good masks people wear? 

I'm UK people flimsy single-layer spandex/lyrca masks see lips cases mask. cloth masks plenty gaps side, around nose wire. 3-ply surgical style masks without nose-wire crimped. think problem may widespread now. husband gotten (that know of) I'd highly doubt we've never encountered least small amounts it, passing people outside, masked work, masked grocery store, eating delivered pizza... Fomite transmission seems rare vector impossible one I've read. Sounds like guys might've crappy roll game chance.

Unfortunately people like generalise based people. mean every country stupid people obviously given US much larger population alot countries easy think everyone US idiot especially look st amount people rallies old donnie. Also help certain man charge behaves like complete dumbass nice tip, thanx Belgium 1000/sqmi population density, things go quick numbers.  full shit tip people here's example lmao defending us tipping culture saying one right underpay workers Baker basically said serves reminder home, rather actually target specific vectors Mask usage observed high levels nationwide according surveys. Sadly can't measure hand-washing distancing easily, large people complying recommendations. worry got meant didn’t agree sacrifice freedoms wealth so...  block getting regular unemployment eligible that's open PUA claim.

They gambled relying recommendations consistently lower mobility throughout year compared Nordics 

The mobility significant lower Nordics ""lockdown"" restrictions applied measures effective longer time Sweden comparison

No, new cases almost disappeared Nordics already May continuing long time Sweden. accusation, established fact. 

It's etablished many Swedish elderly given palliative care oxygen help intensive care. graph showing age groups intensive care Nordics Sweden outlier regards 70+ 80+.  really hate say this, think pandemic eventually ending herd immunity vaccine come around. We've helped hospitals lot lockdowns. However, states like Florida driving herd immunity, even though states like Maine super tight. Completely incorrect. addition forms immunity antibodies, vaccines ability stimulate Ab response infection. I’m volunteer trial experimental covid vaccine. got want able hug parents without fear infecting them. unfortunately blow idea. get it, I’m low risk I’m really afraid. want able go visit 70 year old parents without killing them. talk window every time kills me. It’s situation everybody loses. It’s pandemic. stink. 

That said, set goalpost thinking around April shit mostly done I’ll best behave hopes that. coming someone already COVID recovered o_o. 75% still bad first gen I'm actually crossing fingers for. That's considered 'high' efficacy would seriously change course pandemic, likely downgrading endemic. Yup. money printer running much better body bags full grandmas. I'm sure day count was. scanning subreddit morning saw 2 countries reporting 1.6.

I'm sorry Canadian, im seeing American education system obviously failing years parents gotten intelligence protect kin. mask end? can’t promote “wearing masks” solution pandemic there’s endgame masks. vaccine best solution allow us go back real normal, “new normal” masks on. Look restaurants resist idea sick days workers strongly.

Their workers generate money daily them; think care customer? Contact trading joke US, unlikely issues getting customers sick, worse people outright shame others feeling way feel. Another lockdown going nothing cause revolt. one outside Reddit going tolerate it. right nobody saying never pay rent again... fix shit... instead giving giant corps millions dollars could give people could pay rent won't... afford school pay for. also married born single father now.

Like not, society set parents (if exist) work kids go school. German I’d say could done lot better though daily discussion. rarely see pro-restriction, anti-social comments get upvoted. Here, ""doom gloom"" exist despite stereotype r/Coronavirus.

Even moderate comments advising caution gets downvoted hard. vaccine always promoted ""end"" pandemic

Where promoted end pandemic? beginning end, taking vaccine immediately make everyone completely immune. takes time roll out, measure effectiveness along way, etc. always clear first round vaccines going help end-all thing. People watch many movies expect instant cure everyone's back perfect health. could be, one anecdotal experience. Let fix headline. Closing schools seems havehelped contain outbreak San Fransisco, numbers still higher necessary reopen them. Ha. twice many waves America. United States can’t lose war Covid refuse fight pandemic. like Ghostbusters. long disappointed person sometime soon I'll gladly accept it. saying lockdown happen, masks, get cases 3 days. C) enough money saved. could well worn certain areas situations long time - like NYC public transit example

That’s fine long it’s voluntary. vaccine mandates lifted. Well people get immunity good old fashioned way then. Sucks them. fact countries like Germany 1st wave much better means could done better politicians businesses focused revenues/profits relections. 

Short term pain long term economic gain much governments bases. necessarily. 

Asymptomatic people less likely stay home feeling sick, course. spreading get high risk people. Yes, fine spreaders symptoms increases probability transmission high risk people. Dr. Fauci said Q3 2021 people might begin feel normal indoors without mask (I think specifically talking Broadway show interview saw, can't find now) *assuming* vaccine distribution goes well, people take vaccine, vaccine efficacious. Fauci pretty cautious guy would trust Q3-Q4 2021 begin feel ""normal"" (meaning pre-pandemic) assuming goes well (so I'm agree you). would surprised masks remain required big events like baseball games, concerts etc. awhile longer maybe mandates things like restaurants bars stores get gradually lifted. using 7 day count 14 day count? countries? give examples? Take look past 7 days Europe only. article said 3rd highest excluding microstates (e.g. andorra). kind somewhere microstate typical sized country. We're definitely lot bigger places like Monaco, Liechtenstein, Andorra etc. can't find consolidated incidence rate data world though. Perhaps places world worse Europe article Never natural infection ever led herd immunity population. I’m saying it’s mixed bag states employers offering compensation time missed due covid. apply disability state understand easy thing approved. research tho big box retailers profiting covid offering compensation like Walmart. Someone start petition something. get 12! anybody 12?! So... important factor competent leadership. People fully understanding Ask government shut rest stimulus checks are. Agree. COVID disease. Let’s allow human nature here. tame disease without turning a**holes. even recommending lockdowns, says self-isolation failures problem less 24-hours Director-General quarantined contact COVID positive person. people place blame China pandemic, completely downplayed let spread rest world.


And yet everyone still looks benevolent monolith wrong number killed even issue places anymore. \-Actually majority businesses operate degree social distancing measures

Lol no. Social distancing many small businesses live decimated them, many shutting doors good. Storefronts, sure, fine social distancing people out. Social distancing within bars, restaurants, music venues, cafes, etc, mean order enforce social distancing, legally limit customer capacity. means restaurants normally hold 75 people one night number reduced like 20, barely covers paying wait staff (let alone rent bills.) holding Summer '21 make money back point really can't tolerate serious restrictions, except maybe occasional mask enforcement temperature checks. Asking businesses operate people ""a years"" insane. small businesses left rate.  Typical thinking completely misses point. Housing isn’t magically available without landlord. Buildings need maintenance utilities. Local governments need property tax revenue. 

You don’t pay rent landlords go bankrupt houses go derelict city can’t maintain infrastructure. 

That doesn’t even consider banks take possession property likely evict tenants Sell property recoup losses Defunct mortgages. homeschool then...? It’s antivax it’s unnecessary lot us.

There election tomorrow. Won’t help time next time.  US 60% bigger Europe (excluding Russia) , bit smaller Europe (including European Russia). far ballpark comparisons, although European country US state comparisons likely meaningful. r/conspiracy posts. decided today. far two options mentioned - either closing borders testing borders. However testing borders would require medicap staff.

If coming risky country already need EU approved PCR test. second sentence example, sprinkle little projection ourself winner.

Conservatives literally surpessing people voting way possible try say democrats it, like actual fuck. I’m talking contact tracing. ability track individual person infected covid interacted with. Wow. Dont hold back now. Anti-vaxers anti-maskers people. selfish shitheads rely others right thing. Interesting, wonder features algorithm narrowed identify that. restaurant industry isn’t well known shit together. would suggest keep ordering take out. Supporting small local restaurants good all, never risk health business. People getting weary stir crazy covid restrictions closures it'd realy nice empathy towards ridicule them. stupidity, humans can't handle isolation able socialize normally much longer. affecting people's mental health.

I look forward day environment snitching, shaming, treating disease like moral failing stops. good anyone. Three Days Grace puts it: ""MAYBE WE'LL TURN AROUND CUZ LATE, NEVER LATE!!!"" also claimed 15 cases would soon 0 said numerous times we’re rounding curve.

I’d take anything says grain salt, whether ends true not. Yeah mean want make slippery slope argument make countries real mitigations. China obvious one ask think New Zealand Australia hurtling toward authoritarian dictatorship. Yes I'm sure juussst lurking around corner, actually enforce rules 12-18 months pandemic last. I'm sure come end 18 months looking like dictatorship. Jacinda rubbing hands together excited force everyone lockdown fOrEvEr ::evil laugh::

Not everyone useless call center retail job. 

There many jobs done 24/7 beyond hospital workers, honestly plenty hospital positions aren’t needed lockdown.

As said million times point: constitution prevents restricting freedom movement citizens. no, can't magicked way easily. Odd, odd. work, positive that, good enough safe enough lives return normal? probably, dont know take time, least year best case scenario Body count++ want differently starting today? 

We know do, want it. Wear masks, stop going disneyworld, stop going bars, avoid unnecessary travel, get vaccinated available.   

It take lock things. Without lockdown (and without disaster relief keep rent paid food table) many people still go work, go parties, thanksgiving dinners, smash mouth concerts. 
 
Lockdowns need eradicate virus. get spread point outbreak occurs city state needs lockdown rest us go uninfected lives normally. problem limited small area actually testing contract tracing needed impacted area prevent reaching anywhere else. virus clear area open too. Unfortunately ""pretend virus exist"" plan resulted outbreaks everywhere without lockdown going take time lower number infections.   Bet won't. He'll wrong, surely.

Based comment graveyard assume people pointed exactly actually responsible making virus political. apparently facts reality political subreddit. don’t deserve support gratutude... deserve hazard pay, sufficient PPE morons outside wear fucking masks stop selfish minute. Exactly.

And military mobilize NYC, reserve/guard doctors/nurses fighting CoVID19 civilian hospitals already military doctors/nurses fighting CoVID19 facilities.

Sure there’s bit capacity across whole system, enough help even tiny fraction overwhelmed hospitals.

The military much tapped summer handful FEMA deployments areas full ignorance. Can’t help deniers time around. !remindme 10 days 5 people gathering go separate gatherings following weekend, see community spread still occur even without mass gatherings bars/restaurants. I’m expert means, thoughts.

You make good point, even mind, seeing different people still less likely risky there's low spread community. Yes correct. Nothing change course pandemic Italy degree necessary. Dithering, dithering. end lockdown come, except longer going on, likely lockdown 3 months more. Idiots. motivating words keep young fellas lifetime? real. I'd unglued none worked. almost looking like 1910's again. half America ? Looks bitter reality! What's funny salary slightly less numerically (before exchange rate), actually come ahead.

Taxes less (on real dollar amount basis). Health care free.

What's love? Thanks words - I'm hoping survive COVID election chaos get there!  health. dont know much know vaccines, fir example chance vaccine causes wrong type antibodies created, effective disease, hard correct body always try use againt covid ir similar vaccine correct difficult... said many things go wrong, hopefully wont Goes right Trumper rallys. ways educate kids without putting viral incubators. tip retail workers you? positivity rate barely budged still 2%. That's them. like serial procrastinators figure wait long enough get around something, irrelevant.

""Sure, never got around shoveling snow, point let melt Spring arrives."" Except Spring new wave infections, snow melting people dying left right. correct. could people produce weaker immune response virus majority. That's lot doom gloom there. Yes, eradicate virus, it'll lessen symptoms, greatly reducing hospitalizations severe symptoms. That's key, essentially keep killing grandma. Things go back normal. why? phase 1..it's going take year get approval phase 3 Get retested! Normally critical mass people incorrect make suddenly correct democracy. tests nasal swab, PCR tests. 

One original deep swab. done NYU Langone. take test make online streamed appointment doctor, told needed one travel. authorized test account, could schedule online system. went scheduled time, got line people. testing there, results quick. said would 1-2 business days results within 7 8 hours. One weird detail NYU, issue number listed use general help line. might need download mobile app (I think called MyHealth NYU Langone something) get everything working right.

The test took doctors office. one swabs around opening nostril. made appointment, took test, given estimate would come 2-3 business days.  ended getting results 2 days later. sent test quest diagnostics. Important note could guarantee results would come time flight (which took multiple tests used different labs), said lab overwhelmed might take longer.

If New York tri-state area, recommend google NYU Langone PCR test. Set digital appointment immediately, schedule test closer time flight one thier facilities. lot locations, state, think limited Tri-state area NY, NJ, Conn. person replied thought I'd chime in

I'm data scientist

&amp;#x200B;

I criticisms per se questions data. *that* big sample.

Simple things could completely ruin results. Take following (simplified) case:

Say 4 classes people participated:

1. people sick. assume 100% mark ""no covid""
2. people sick negative covid result, assume people participate one reason another
3. people sick positive covid result. 100% people say covid
4. people sick gotten covid tested. assume people say positive result

&amp;#x200B;

there surveys showing *many many times* people *think* they've covid actually it. lots people think they've it. real big assumption case makes may end accurate people gotten negative covid result low participation data

now, people sick thought covid (somewhat supported surveys many peopel think covid) many people negative covid test bothered participate, would actually discriminating forced cough healthy person forced cough sick person, ""sick"" case people actual positive results always equates covid.

&amp;#x200B;

i'd interested targeted training set x amount forced coughs disease (flu, common cold, asthma, allergies, etc). gather paper *is possibility results meaningless*. like said. case came fabricated. nothing paper telling case. *know* set bunch coughs people ill diseases &amp; people correctly said covid. results study could well meaningful make be, situation like one described could mean results absolutely meaningless. study warrant investigation.

redo coughs recorded doctor's office given covid rapid test also keep metadata know flu, cold, respiratory illness, covid , show correctly identifies covid instead things instead covid vs ""not covid""

&amp;#x200B;

edit: also beginning pandemic, doctors would say pretty much everyone ""presumed positive"" hospitals working low staff tests go around. turns covid. neither gf. neither friends ""presumed positive"" got antibody tests couple months later. participated study, would marked covid doctor said presumed positive. really *anyone symptoms* would classed ""presumed positive"" remember, supports skepticism. said, believe well made machine learning models most, I'm convinced yet. hope redo better data they've given initial indication might work well thing is, Sweden reports deaths delay 2 weeks.

So pretty much everyone else. 

* [90% deaths Sweden recorded wtihin 11 
* ONS data (England Wales)[ reporting delay 11 days date due processes around death certification registration. 
* [63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date bet countries similar, first couple checked. 40% population obese Different symptoms. Yes, spread, things like severity symptoms make difference. understand cultures form “day dead”. need understand Spaniards stole holiday Mexicans! I’m sure Spaniards honored dead Souls’ Day whatever day dead. day dead Mexican holiday stolen NEW WORLD. Maybe stop arguing someone right. recommend following article. experts still interpreting data - appears lockdowns reduce deaths. specifically talk Sweden voluntary isolation effort mimicked lockdowns countries. millions us high risk thanks shitty genetics young, want live full life too! ”drive-in funerals” ""Mass Grave""

That's go mobile morgues. like 40% population Wut still people deny issue. self-fulfilling prophecy. selfish assholes rejected attempts help slow spread, many months. whine they've deal restrictions (that ignored) *so long* caused tangential issues, *have* ignore even *more*.

If followed restrictions voluntary distanced while, we'd mostly back normal. pissing read people giving *when never even tried begin with.* latest excuse wearing masks, limiting outings, etc. figured could get long enough make ""it's long!"" final line reasoning. Schizophrenia Oh good. starting eat themselves. sure. capacity regular morgues hold extra bodies. bad.. recall early pandemic. us thought seriously schools would even closed. partners close contact with. COVID parties, haha good yous, absolutely blame ya! Go see Blacks game me, always dream mine see play there! 

The salary might good there, accounts quality life excellent, particularly outdoorsy types. probably cant wipe planet, definitely able eraadicate community spread turn something like measles, chance low cause concern. Low test numbers = low cases. Australia too. even testing- simple mask wearing! SK, Japan, countries area always strong proponents wearing masks sick. US masks somehow became political issue bunch morons ruined everyone. don’t think anyone clear understanding actually saying healthy kids greater risk. true adults unless much older.

But would said kid asthma another comorbidity like diabetes kidney disease? given society, entity would say power mold behavioral patterns individuals within society? Yeah, covid turns something gets kinda sick couple days that's it, nothing else really matters. Humanity living long there's humanity. mean, 5334 tests yesterday get number, like they're anywhere near identifying SARS really hit one area particularly hard (Toronto) 15 years ago. Since Ontario, there’s deep cuts public health, little growth healthcare delivery, wage stagnation nursing, increase 30% population “experienced” city. take together, it’s unsurprising response was/is mediocre Toronto, basically first time “laissez-faire” pretty much everywhere else. can't force people test. test surely available though. Again, legally contact trace scale talking about. insane think guy without mask gave you; could dozens people store? Masks 100% effective People west isolate similar situation like Colombia, can't afford another lockdown restrict travel country. think would happen vaccines taking longer usual? don’t think people willing sacrifice another year, let alone love. one party system. never, ever democratic.  somehow blocked collecting.

You fight it, employer deny reason fight do. time get even win fucked, designed way.

A year ago people spouting benefits wiping 50% population would finding tons great points. facing reduction 1% people forgetting benefits people dying. Well, one likes Mondays guess great. thread UK. cheap ass neighbors tip anything.

Whereas nobody tips UK, pay decent wages. UK paper talking effects UK scheme people UK.

Maybe make sweeping statements assuming everybody subsidises workers like does? Ehhh... watching Instagram stories friends London pretty big parties. T.y.  Covid 19 mutated strain sars 1 utterly sad many levels. said 'in west' - pretty much definition also going include canada, western europe, australasia (and decent number would include democratic east asian countries heavily influenced west, least politically), definitely US. 

saying suffer 'from many freedoms' thing asian kids math different point government competency. Yep :) Record 163 individual gigs 2015, working part time concert photographer, 109 gigs last year almost exclusively bands wanted actually see :D Maybe try Know-Nothings Going-Against-Research something like that. seem imply places wore masks majority populace asian countries predominantly do. seriously doubt hypothesis. known reporter cases SARS since 2004 Hate bring age it, long suspected Boomers thinking straight this. 

This **isn't** even close 1957 Flu Pandemic, 1968 (which killed one grandmas). survive either flu find possibly permanent heart problems. may acceptable 80s, much 20s 30s. 

(I say twice cancer survivor kid 40s developed heart issues chemo) healthcare workers see hospitals overwhelmed, colleagues infected, end sight stream new patients every day. money stimulus checks come from? comes bonds sell __China__. pay interest bonds __China__ __30 years__, pay __China__ lump sum bonds' value. 30 years, China continues steal jobs technology mismanaging research labs heavily populated areas real oversight, another accident happens cannot ""contain"". Next up.... “but never vaccine coronavirus!” like lottery bag. COVID maniacs mandate masks, even people home, alone, themselves. 

(protip, that's already happening)

&amp;#x200B;

so guy said border closures travel bans unnecessary need wear masks June?

K. Agreed. perfect middle ground let vaccinated, healthy population live lives normally continue isolate risk can't get vaccinated.  say torrents new alt posting three days ago mental health wants ASAP Oh know, thats said mixed bag. try can, heard horror stories. finally going give NHS £350 million per week? would indeed help covid. may seem like comforting number compared almost 8,000 Saturday, almost 30,000 less tests numbers based on. 
Illinois right around 50 daily new cases per 100,000 residents. right around 9th highest US. climb around 15 extra cases per 100k past week so.
Positivity rate also steadily climbing. 8.1% today. widespread across state. like summer contained pockets around edges state part. Wrong thread. Also, think stroke writing that. paper 20A.EU1 also Sneaky sneaky Others follow. bet going we're gonna lock national level two weeks. could say 'Taiwan' . Unprompted, even. Nice!  point, going happen going happen US.

BUT interesting seeing perspective people 80s...who would course risk pandemic. seems family members concerned health, own, I’ve seeing articles anecdotes grandparents want normal holiday season families want “take chances” (im broad here). Plus many lived public health crises, like points out.

Also, think becoming strange obsession case counts death stats...with latest technology people seem obsessed those, almost horse race game best worst states, whereas previous pandemics (even H1N1 remember) wasn’t constant running meters graphics. 

Idk, even agree disagree article, interesting perspective. China literally welded people apartment complexes couldn’t leave. PLA soldiers patrolling streets guns detaining anyone outside.

New Zealand never anything like practically eliminated virus. 99% normal. Fuck 65% nonsense. 65% little we're many places. shit, course late stop it. could stopped source last year. kids schools closed. It’s big deal me. honestly, care virus effects, go live life. Nobody's preventing gathering, throwing parties, traveling eating out. I'm liberal progressive SoCal played ultimate frisbee park weekend. literally quince going couple dozen guests freakin mariachi band! kid not. point pandemic every man/woman themselves. virus hit town community one protect you, one save you. late that. maybe admit there’s excessive death toll 2020? love guy. He's getting Hate groups ignorant assholes 30 years, still fighting I'm northern NJ would say mask compliance really really good stores i've to. granted I've literally inside supermarkets admittedly Walmart attract kind clientele (even pre covid).

As relates parties/gatherings, really struggling stop these. spread truly coming private gatherings hell do. Short become police state really know, becomes line think can't crossed gov enforcing people homes. Ill work mathnatical models run program give u theory day two need ground look schools

Sure everyone slack go chin masks, places generation remembers OG SARS slack much much less. definitely true, even positive rate tests high. Germany estimated 6,2 times people covid tested. could lower like Slovakia validated here. much effort avoid something damn simple, called fucking lawyers masking god people suck Excelent data test decreased. dramatically.

Positivity decreased last week. seems increasing now. dramatically either.

Check * ** figures updated due non-consolidated data. u stupid people You’re expressing fault blame hospitals empty, November, pointing finger at? 

It seems like you’re making blanket statement large part byproduct Covid. 

To point, could attempt place blame government perhaps back spring, hospitals aren’t restricted really haven’t months country. First off, I'm wasting time work, trolling. Weird metric trolling. 

Second, sure context comments supposed be. hospitals already overloaded lockdowns may necessary, always said. used primary tool (as already said). context think I'm missing? there's people tell stop 'selfish' go homeless *might* infect someone covid person *might* die. 

They idea homeless is. Cool, again, that's yours. Anecdote best. representative situation large. unemployment 5 months hoping state would go lockdown... ran savings unemployment. I’ve working 2 months point, I’m worried fucked taxes going next year unemployment/ lack insurance getting Covid.. they’re setting us failure. destiny US depends elections. One choice means US was. DT fluke. democracies around world change demeanor towards US based that.

C19 big part it.  Hey buddy I’m you. think need get Reddit shit censored owned Chinese. right. wrong think nation infant mortality rates life expectancy like Libera covid tests? us Americans much man lol like dude get stereotype lot us also upset we’re getting ass whooped covid Yes I’m sure nobody target store, none 150+ coworkers have, responsible spreading virus. It’s darn wedding folk. living Broadway like I'm Bachelorette party live AK feel you. I've actively mocked public wearing mask. understand people's thought process. consumption tripled since lockdown.

[You'll needing Ehh, extent. dont contest unemployment benefits get paid sick days dependent long they’ve 40 hours/yr iirc. 

Its average amount time work/ last 3 weeks. say average 35 hours/wk 3 weeks. get 35 sick days max/yr.

We also gave 15-300 week 3 weeks, whenever locked down. guaranteed $50 bonus per shift +hourly/tips working lockdown. Dude Alex Jones gave sandy hook denying piece trash air time. I’m sorry screw Joe Rogan thing make effort need backup. Western countries failing mild. Akin head cold chest congestion. Listen. Lockdowns optional. population distances, masks washes hands government tests, contact traces isolates.

Have pillars working hard shutdowns necesary.

However, population enough, eventually virus goes, well, viral healthcare systems overwhelmed. shutdowns longer optional.

Do want avoid shutdowns? Wear masks convince others wear masks. Fam asking thing. free cash dope know people really need it. authoritarian, privacy-free, human rights abusing, anti-democracy. Wouldn’t good news? algorithm useful determining sick cough vs healthy cough. actually intended differentiate covid respiratory illnesses.

The point really figure exactly works, idea determine experimentally works. reason AI exciting let's us solve problems ways necessarily come intuition. Simple association incredibly powerful sufficient trial error.  doesn’t fit narrative. bet people get covid grocery store. It’s going reported way What's alternative hospitals already overflowing? keep taking comments context speedy reply obviously trolling. come bring sources then. season passes? i'll take 10 thanks. Gladly Hoax would imply Virus real, is. I'm sorry life goes on. people want take vaccine oh well. It'll like flu people get higher risk. difference people die.  Former teacher checking. taught five years leaving pursue another career. Parents want what's best kids. want what's easiest convienent kids. accountability parents. always teacher's/school's fault. Administrators much better throw anyone bus necessary. 

I can't even imagine teacher pandemic deal ignorant parents. used teach Texas know parents making life hell teachers right now. 

When/if kids, seriously considering sending public schools. mind paying taxes fund public education, want learn quality content I'm sure today. much want pin ""better-to-do"" people, let's realistic. Better-to-do people huge advantage, Halloween, traveling rich part town back apartment, tell big correlation income disregarding COVID rules.

This education problem, can't ignore it. ""covid-iots"" often lower class citizens (as rural Republicans). clean picture victims perpetrators (unless look deeper oppose education citizens). First, self declaration: job provide it.

If caught something else work declaration, work made accountable.

Second, know got number 90% workforce I'd definitely love source one.

And finally, answer ""I know"".

I crystal ball.

Maybe times prove right, maybe won't. empathize position ultimately feel right kids. said, point reach emotional rather rational response something, elementary school aged kids, think falls bit emotional category given COVID infection fatality death rate ages 6-18 order 1 100,000 (and includes long-tail instances children compromised immune systems due pre-existing conditions, etc - average healthy child, death rate even lower). 

I sure things already, concern would best invested things like - making sure kids know swim avoid accidental drowning, purchasing cars latest safety features, giving healthy diet, moving away point pollution sources, engaging parenting behaviors correlated reduced drug use late adolescence impact keeping child home school COVID. 

Again, good reasons keep kids home centered around controlling community spread vulnerable. advocating in-person schooling begin with. fearing health children losing argument - material risk. get KN95/KF94's amazon/ebay ask wait outside car turn. waiting area potentially sick ppl dangerous. general, nurses, doctors &amp; practicioners direct contact patients regularly tested nowadays avoid asymptomatic transmission. First. I'm Missouri. Proboaly first lol. know. I'm living boat.

I individualist though, abso fucking lutely wear mask. might individualist, ironically strong self preservation instinct exactly *why* care much getting others sick.

Just wanted say mutually exclusive thing. people scum. think I’m saying racist need work English definitions more. also need study history, since Spaniards bring dia de los muertos Mexico. already holiday celebrated Valley Mexico long European reached Americas. uncultured historically ignorant. 

And stop calling racist, nothing I’ve said racist. said Spaniards stole holiday Mexico. It’s historical fact. Good. Probably one weirdos, honestly. federal government doesn’t jurisdiction healthcare. can’t set health policy whole country without obtaining buy provinces. masks useful track-and-trace strong. victim blaming person infected invisible hard detect virus?

Him getting sick prove anything. tell GM?! must know artificial UV lighting, would work?  Eradication impossible virus circulating non-human animal hosts. Yep. lockdowns India put people confined space together without good ventilation, would easily explain that. Unless infected, quarantined 3 months. 

Isolation specifically infected presumed/potentially infected. That's talking here, people quarantining. Complete total misuse word ""eradication"". feel like giving convincing ""distance 2022"" crowd anything, least lives back summer they'll still houses can't annoy us  Front-line workers essential workers. Though many confuse two. clapping shining lights doctors nurses, frontline workers. essential workers refers well, also includes office workers, restaurants, anything close lockdown. eys, agree sentiment bullshit. mask distance 2023 then.

RIP dating. RIP career. 

Gotta start scratch.

Also, RIP grandma. 98 completely fine, guess I'll never able hug see smile unless live 102.

/s. GTFO here. I'd trust 100% cure vaccine widely available public near future expect Texans' front office ever anything competent. live around become political social statement wear mask indoors public. don’t care others, care get sick. federal government didn’t “delegate”. don’t jurisdiction healthcare per constitution. can’t take something outside jurisdiction that’s super unconstitutional illegal. Chinese invented paper there's that. mean “what”? would never given complete lockdown conrainment suggestion,

China totalitarian State means reasons try complete lockdown 

All countries went ahead followed totalitarian playbook 

But China used State support model sustain revive economy , whilst democracies copied Chinese model lockdown still figuring recovery package sick people work, that's failure policy economic system. Individual critique warranted case. 

I'm irritated failure even basic care taken people's private lives. starts really simple stuff. Today took garbage municipal bins front house, meet two neighbours standing close together entrance hall talking fucking dogs without masks on. Neither likely infected. even manage trivial case properly, work people comes safe public transport safe essential work? responsibility actions individuals lies entirely individuals. society's government's responsibility instill sense civic duty people. continuously fails so, thus partially responsible consequences every single person's antisocial behavior. wish could build group. wife works hands children can’t really see anyone one fucking said that. extremely rare occurrence. appreciate posts here, vibes daily threads really prevents doom-and-gloom posts getting head objective fact necessary restrict movement higher degree usual. People disagree this, factual question. 
You need set criterias, people agree criterias importance criteria, get problems one objectively wrong here. fear people reading headline article, also misunderstanding difference isolation quarantine.


Isolation = infected close contact infected.


Quarantine = infected choose avoid contacts/going outside.



They talking sick isolating, close contact isolating. 

That's failure talking - people told told stay home staying home governmental policies surrounding isolation often lacking. co-worker came work yesterday chills, sweats,and vomited break room. boss told take extra long lunch break tough out. 

We're supposed following pre work self check. Staff follow it, management could give less shit. wonder 25 people put two weeks 4 associates got Covid past 2 weeks. Follow regulations long impact numbers kind BS. could look steady increase cases deaths late September disregard predictions weeks?

If orders magnitude criticism would warranted, they're not. People behaved irresponsibly leadership failed educating communicating populace dangerous virus is. talking Germany particular EU US general.  makes difference, makes us hopefully **less** susceptible second wave.'

Context bitca innit. SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, coronavirus, genetically similar SARS-CoV-1, caused SARS outbreaks.

SARS-CoV-2 mutated strain SARS-CoV-1, ie descended SARS-CoV-1. 

I’m pretty sure Google link research origins SARS-CoV-2 - there’s lot genome analysis going right now. individualist realize good whole case ALSO good you. (Not general, pandemics? Absolutely.) ""Socialism bad! Except pays medical care god-king! bails corporations using tax dollars! someone joins military!"" --You, probably No. usually get sick winter. thought cold tested positive. Well, no. mean exact locations claims overwhelmed. That's actually US right away. Trump even provided CDC research, criteria setting certain restrictions let governors run states. result people hopped state state, enjoying extended break, wound bring COVID country. Communities managing well got overrun people started moving taking them. 

What else could done? Lock people test positive contacts? would caused real revolt everyone knows it. think BLM rallies bad, seen anything. People self isolate long money runs out. US one stimulus check. Don’t blame people failures federal government. There’s much individual do. extent still have: 1) people getting sick even vaccine, 2) people accept vaccine getting sick, 3) vulnerable still affected well No, government fault. comes personal responsibility. think co-worker trying say s/he direct contact someone turned positive, want admit it. cousin get tested g/f made similar story, fact socializing group sorority friends, hanging eating without kind distancing. appreciate thoughtful reply. helped develop thoughts little bit find yet another way look pandemic country’s response. (To frame perspective, I’m speaking liberal community embedded rural/conservative US) 

This pandemic’s mortality pattern unique doesn’t change shape normal mortality patterns. makes steeper. older always makes likely die. obese, male, heart disease, diabetes asthma, “underlying health conditions” general, (I say it) poor minority.

I think resistance lockdowns may connected this. least live there’s sort of, well, fatalism life, believe linked myth individualism state healthcare system. It’s easy think trying extend one’s life futile unrealistic. way thinking, it’s luck anyways. Like Americans stripes, living one paycheck disaster time already. Losing job, even losing hours work week, familiar immediate threat. 

The resistance shortsighted, though, especially extended much less disruptive measures reduce transmission rates – masks, social distancing, etc. also ignores widespread disruption happens even normal mortality patterns accelerated beyond certain point. middle-aged men hidden heart disease die heart attacks every year. family community ways adjust already built in. don’t way adjust bunch die time instead spread years. Ditto mortality factors. Ditto emergency/intensive care medical system. myth individualism - myth, blind deep interdependence. Yes think contained stopped. I’m going honest man even tried threat covid completely absent immunity muh antibody decline means immunity (i guess) Anyone job receive it, whole point underwhelming manoeuvre allow basically anyone (except leisure industry) work (thus kids go school). able travel Rome Paris Marseille plane work reason, needed documents: one control flights. actor, shooting series. Seriously? wear n95 basically day long, avoid crowd, respect distancing, wash hand, felt living proof lockdown useless. Obesity. 97,000 infections behaving intelligently around virus. That's subject. one trying distract that, claiming infections testing.

Until say tests cause infections infections cause positive tests, misinforming people. bought planeticket Xmas back lockdown long cases falling sure Xmas would safe cautiously travel again. Also plane ticket like what, 60% cost ticket last year?


Welp. late refund :/ Lol someone seriously downvote this? F GOVERNOR! We’re acting like it’s typical earth coronavirus mutates seasonally. republican party stating entire time. sure telling me, was, again, responding comment poster said tipped.

Also, seem like UK good job providing waiter waitresses, maybe subsidize help oh Great Benevolent One: bright side, WHO's website shows zero flu deaths last months. got going us..... long still trust WHO.. they'd never lie. saw many people went highschool posting instagram stories weekend huge halloween parties. one person posted video smoking punch bowl... like wtf trying give friends family covid?!? That's great all, people already following experts. vaccine releases makes COVID ""mostly safe"", even cautious people go back everyday life. could see happening possibly holding major things like massive sporting events gatherings. That’s real shame, I’m sorry husband experienced that. I’m glad get N95s stay safer. boyfriend residential plumber obviously can’t work home either. boss shut months keep guys customers safe (going 3-5 homes per day already spreads virus quickly is), reopen qualify small business help, get everyone back work UI ran out. often full Tyvek suits wear N95s homes now. friends work home fairly well-off Millennials, never said word it, risks labor industry depend take. want everyone able stay home, vote better social safety nets hold government responsible gets held up, like state, unemployment checks took MONTHS get paid out. then, many people going continue work. 

Your husband’s work shouldn’t vilified can’t home, I’m sorry received criticism that. I’m glad you’re able pay bills get masks. Best wishes both. Thanks work do. Yeah thought we'd able better job too. part job everyone engaging public health measures, think we'd able stop implementing things got better.

Seems pretty comparable me. Things happen cause happen. let happen. group powerless. France many obese people. I'd say vaccine available, optional - business requires it, business must provide it. Given many people there, what’s stopping people giving false name?

Not sure different States, generally here, needn’t carry ID outside specific circumstances (driving), confirming identity hundreds people reasonable time quite difficult(constitutional rights concerning holding individual unreasonable amount time). Many minors don’t ID card all, given many lesser crimes expunged 18, 17 year old could give false name avoid fines. Time jump grenade volunteer local hospital.

Yup, 13 year died insignificant. /s fair, not. advocated multi-pronged approach paper primary promotion media focused lockdowns. mean we’ve one stimulus check. much people want prevent spread, literally work survive.

It's worse that. People come work even paid well given sick days. 

I'm white collar, excuse. People still get entire office sick. really need change view work sick days. done purpose btw reason force people back work hell consequences.

They dont care us. labor shortage lead hospitals offer better incentives (pay, benefits) attract nurses...... nah... Somehow Hospital execs screw patients nurses time. It’s easier post source make assertion though. Google search give tons results may accurate. it’s always nice see origin statistics told. Lol one social distancing get vaccine What? live remote island connected largest trading block free movement world. think study supports fact one less careful social distancing recovering COVID, that's implying. Yes. Except pandemic started last November Asia. United States centre universe. South Korea took swift action anything really known. Yeah, there's still social pressure it. Like hoping get sick living normally wanting so. Kindly take shame tactics borderline death threats (because that's essentially statements like ""Enjoy getting sick going ICU"" are) go.

TL;DR: part shame culture talking about. Thanks proving point.  *surprised Pikachu face* Sounds like US utter shit managing itself. opened link first thing says “Dia de los Muertos—the Day Dead—is lively Mexican holiday draws indigenous European traditions.” 
LOL No, didn’t hear? November 4th we’ll completely stop hearing COVID yes case vaccine vulnerable hospitals nit overwhelmed, masks past places, proper vaccines still certainty, could many hurdles overcome, mainly strands, covid vaccine work like flu vaccine guarantee everything seems illegal party happen, covid would still thing. every party happen, covid would still thing. shut society extent prevent spread, would starve freeze. people trying kill parents, empathy instead blaming  others stated, beef people work outside home enable family stay home. beef really people weddings, going church, meeting extended family, engaging riskier activities.

Those actions selfishness goddamn reason. [For comparison, 1918 flu deaths looked like every pandemic, second wave always worse first. Yes, tangentially related coronavirus, maybe one vectors unexplained contact cases ambulance service northwest England, one areas **worst-hit COVID-19**, said declared major incident Monday exceptionally high volume calls, especially Greater Manchester area.

“We trying best reach patients soon possibly can,” North West Ambulance Service said statement, calling people **not call ambulance unless condition life-threatening**. You’re overthinking word delegate. don’t mean feds passed buck crisis, meant exactly did, implementation health care assigned (or “delegated”) provinces constitution. Doctors nurses also get sick burnout higher rates well, since they're handling disaster-level amounts critical patients days, even weeks row. see effects New York state's Covid stats: 33,000 dead 514,000 confirmed cases, 6.4% fatality, drastically higher 1-3% seen states overwhelmed badly. actually lost 6 new servers 3 weeks would go screaming rampaged. happened multiple times new employees show would line they'd walk middle service. would scream yell constantly. 


He faith staff. would hire outside help weddings big functions think could handle it. refused let us collect tips tip pooled everything. Even working 200+ person event bartender allowed use tip jar. Servers never tipped per ""rules"". since tip pooled tips, would hire outside help would take away actually employees payroll cut share. INSANE. 


After covid even let put bar stools out. basically worked service bar, get tipped last month making $8.50/hr outrageous considering restaurant typically average $35-$40. 


I lost ton money working there. Hard labored hours setting tearing rooms. shit ass pay. get yelled conservative old fucker. Fuck that. 


So told basically that. Called monster, reminded still owed tip $150 dinner wife two weeks prior. tickle twat. ""Common sense"" quite frequently contradicted scientific inquiry. ""Common sense"" trustworthy tool realms science medicine. Tali fine Yes agreed, could really game changer.

To clear though, probably helpful situation describe son. Based way algorithm works, would likley get result ""unhealthy cough detected, go get tested"" even though cough caused covid. know plenty essential employees. Trust lot young like go out, dont blame thou. deserve fun.  testing widely available? contact tracing millions infections without breaking civil liberties? tragedies happen, way prevent them. Blaming dude grocery store global pandemic reaching meaning psychologically similar conspiracy theorists: something bad happened must someone's fault Bad bot! Moron party still morons. virus virus muppet downvoted thank response kind sir Nope. acceptable vaccine keeps deaths hospitalizations minimal. Feel free enjoy benefits even lower employment rate case. don’t live don’t work there, work multi-billion dollar essential business follows state mask mandate letter. 

It’s beyond defeating trying maintain every cdc protocol, liar waltz right defeat purpose. Meanwhile I’m trying play therapist high risk employees around maskless people every single day. 

The anti maskers California won, high risk people lost. Political correct place n pandemic policy prevent asymptomatic spread spread people die. 

You think we'd wearing masks covid common cold? god Fauci wrote peer reviewed article majority deaths spanish flu pandemic actually bacterial pneumonia caused masks

Can point say masks cause? conclusion identifies ""Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, treatment secondary bacterial pneumonia, well stockpiling antibiotics bacterial vaccines"", ""avoiding mask wearing"" means reduce mortality.

I've read majority, can't find anything suggest masks problem, search ""mask"" return results. except coronaviruses ""mutate seasonally."" that's flu. goes show doctors like Fauci never lie. severe consequences people Fauci’s position lie. comes next? Water wet? Ummm went £8 April year, mean next rise... central NJ.

Mask usage required 99%. people see take masks get car leaving store.

But parties gatherings what’s killing everyone. It’s chilly lately, people gathering indoors now. went Halloween party outside said goodbye friends unless unnaturally warm winter won’t seeing next year. 

People gonna wanna do. I’m teacher district chose continue remote February. know see video classes? Kids houses, abroad visiting families home countries (which spiking rates limited space hospitals). Won’t stop, can’t stop. ends society says does. sooner people stop complying en masse, sooner we're done. Please celebrate Christmas year help end this. Polio =/= Covid.

Las cruces basically suburb el Paso. big whole lot (mostly good restaurants). except ""forcing idiots line"" negative health consequences lot people-- loss jobs leading poverty, chronic health condition. really saying want liberty health elevated people.

Honestly though saying ""individual liberty come cost people's health"" asinine, especially talking indirect effects like respiratory virus transmission. would possibly draw line statement made? drive car contributes pollution poor air quality, obviously damaging peoples' health. allowed drive cars? also 1/10th population much better IQ obesity levels..... we're stuck shit really really long time  Yep, that's truth--Same thing Czechia(550,000 US equivalent cases one day last week), much pronounced reduction(US equivalent 121,00 cases yesterday) Belgium call bluff accept deal? three players, House, Senate, Oval, odds beginning. plan released support two three. disease isn’t issue exists! That’s trying say. found SARS1 existed July year. looking pandemic list comparing Covid, and...I actually know ones list existed either. [No, said main podcast, definitely always held get element levity conversation, think pretty clear part people reacting to. sub terrified start pandemic it’s fair. Tell health care workers. Latest information another round tests regions 0.7% positivity higher next weekend. Future plans also include testing healthcare workers employees retirement homes twice month moving forward.

People tested positive required self-isolate together families 10 days. take paid sick leave specifically purpose they're employed.

As groceries etc. generally expected family/friends buy leave front door order online delivery guy leave front door. Apparently single person thread bothered click link read first paragraph, talking self-isolation tested positive. I'm pretty sure majority sub young adults decided live van awhile instead parents basement, could return whenever feel like. agree it’s bad situation screw people don’t think designed way. 

Without sort checks balance system open abuse bureaucracy takes time. 

Not knowing almost anything it; genuinely curious better system would look like? anecdote: western countries many people still strongly believe god. 23 years old. That's different. Apparently single person thread bothered click link read first paragraph, talking self-isolation tested positive. think there'd real problem segment population relying app exclusively, ignoring ""getting tested"" part. People need check MD making decisions based posts here. Well aware sure relevant. proponent long term lock downs extensive government intervention. Important note monkey's study fucking shit tonnes coronavirus dosed them. read much stuff nasal cavity, still quite possible vaccine usual amounts coronavirus essentially eliminate nose. People die covid though. average 400 people month die El Paso. 

But covid deaths come that's morgue overwhelmed. Anyone understanding implications imperfect vaccine virus's secondary effects, e.g. heart complications, brain fog, neurological issues? dad tested positive again, 7 months later. We're sure false positive not, odd symptoms nobody else house tested positive again. noise especially problem Canada. close US, constantly told ""not bad compared states"". problems minimized even efforts praised least bad US.

It's frustrating living reading countries surviving fine closures lockdowns we're convinced working compared noise US. dont include results daily statistics?  Fucking exactly, look NZ full stadium's rugby - sure looks nice normal me. again? Oh yea, 7k stimulus, hard quarentine lockdown measures, care packages, extensive thorough testing, tracing, MASKS, BOOM months later, fucking rugby. Snowden leaked information could handled privately. whole affair could handled internally.

Contrast public need information many hands possible. case whistleblower, one follow established means report mishandling information, options release information publicly. Man bots getting smarter everyday. way person human. looking small fraction picture here. Take look chart 7 day rolling average new cases. line relatively flat last 7 months going straight upwards. El Paso seeing extremely alarming rate exponential spread. deaths follow curve 2-3 week delay. there’s widespread vaccines then, ain’t way masks required. Besides, important people always get first.  Yeah :/ live Rogers park/edgewater area. husband cashier, pick extra shifts call-outs (non-covid related, least). worry time. really get point truly like living seasonal flu periods would pretty good compared now. much worse that--Belgium recently 652,000 US equivalent cases, yesterday US equivalent 470,000 US cases, today 330,000 US cases--If US 'dumpster fire' Belgium freaking Volcano care they're ""calling for""-- Illinois shut restaurants bars financial support coming balance loss work. 

It seems like call support, still enact lockdowns even support coming. complaining about? Trump said US cases testing. Slovakia tests half whole freaking country, 1% positive cases. I'm trying say, probably badly, shows wrong Trump is. Taking risks makes situation complaining worse. Validating decisions say screw helping situation. Sometimes answer sucks grown ups it.

This occurs young, well suffered brain trauma maladies.

My suggestion cede making determinations things like get resolved. opening schools :) go NJ /s ridiculous. No, antigen tests show Covid moment, less reliable PCR tests, much faster (result 15-20 minutes). looks like awesome use rapid testing sus asymptomatic cases. anyone Slovakia Slovak speaker insight public health plans dealing information? people positive tests expected self isolate? Slovakia social net place ensure people tested positive don’t miss meals/rent? Transfer patients Germany...

Germany 9 neighbour countries read same. spring patients also came Italy Germany. Let's hope Germany keep numbers manageable, though even Germany's ICU capacity never meant big enough patients half Europe. hope time come Germany able help neighbours anymore. Oh I'm disagreeing all, understand city try shut got sued state Texas it, pretty unlikely work. US might end control group global experiment. number 1 indicator whether COVID vast negative repercussions ones personal health. Thats nature disease.

No country dealing COVID optimally. think government primary reason Taiwan Japan performing better looking cultural economic variables allowed report low infection rates. Yeah everything I've read even mild cases people sometimes need several weeks rest make full recovery. dealt chronic illness suggest bite bullet figure way sit home month resting. Talk friends family tell need help. Look local aid, fundraiser internet whatever need stay home get health back. 

The possibility suffering long covid fully understand they're starting suspect might autoimmune. subreddit covid long haulers might able help get study something well make suggestions recommendations they've do. really think US Federal government timely, thorough, consistent appropriate response? beginning, even since?

To suggest everything could laughable. would funny. masks? people keep getting sick, half year small fraction people covid. want people stop going parties, pick handful people bubble love god, cancel weddings selfish pieces shit.

Well, guy, control yourself. sad reality life everyone different hierarchies needs, get tell people do. thought ended Easter that’s rounding bend /s yeah I’m hoping next summer it’ll good news bad mayor isnt wearing mask properly

It's bit odd largest Covid treatment center country closed lack patients Covid Care Centre (CCC) Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC), touted biggest facility treatment asymptomatic mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients country, shut September patients cited reason closing 10,100-bed facility.

India still incredibly low deaths/million. currently #87 world 89 deaths per million. f defending billionaires lmfao.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* agree. State wide Mask mandate changed well. masks necessary outside distancing can't kept.

They completely mandatory public exceptions. “We didn’t anything we’re ideas.” - Texas gubmint article also says there's going 3 billion doses ready January! Plus, frontrunner vaccines supposedly going boat. Guardian independent track US Nurses lost front US keeping healthcare worker statistics hidden.

A separate analysis global infection rates International Council Nurses (ICN) suggests least 20,000 healthcare workers died total COVID, although extrapolation concrete numbers exist.  helps explain El Paso virus lurks night lot cases reinfection last month. think last number confirmed reinfections saw 129 total. actually know long term effects kids like children 1918 pandemic (ie. although kids asymptomatic time infection, virus might damage scar organs arteries resulting poorer health outcomes kids age). wtf mean? think ignoring mask gathering mandates? Even national government failed, states cities implemented mask mandates social distancing guidelines still ignored. People acting like nothing going violating government policy 100% blamed looks like encountered resistance quit. better system tell state's Department Labor told us. feel like close enough hear it, late you. Lyon, week week I've seen restaurants bars PACKED.  Good. Self isolation mean lock down. article claims everyone self isolates positive covid test / close contact covid positive, might even need lock down. unemployment benefits needed billions/trillions government stimulus.  They're going say pollution contagious, come on, man.

The issue keeping people line is, well, draw line? fines anti-maskers? Probably. people calling cops neighbors there's extra car driveway? No. let people individual liberty comes running red lights speed limits, also prevent people buying fast cars. point, also quite accurate compare 4 cold causing corona viruses circulating populations least long we've able identify viruses. Also situation probably infected right now. risk transmission spouses 27.7%, (See Table 3 one small study said spouses quarantined together much higher risk, around 60%.) 

Covid primarily respiratory disease, spread easily lacks direct access lungs. multi-hour conversation small enclosed spaces, sang together, droplet exchange would high, risk transmission would higher kissing/saliva exchange, even would 100%. nice illustrations viral concentration buildup works. 

Best luck both! wearing masks helps period.

WEAR FUCKING MASK thing, mostly surplus TP hoarding means spend 3x much time plunging toilet Interesting, thought 'k-rens' (a misogynist slur middle aged women) care restrictions? confirmed ones. ones severe symptoms looked first (and likely picked period).

There dozens dozens asymptomatic mild reinfections genetically tested yet. backlogs. Hundreds really. Many probably happened earlier dismissed testing issues long infections.

On top that, point symptomatic reinfections stick out. recently infected probably testing much. asymptomatic reinfections probably completely missed. 

And lets forget reinfections early likely happening people proper immune responses. **(Edit occurred asymptomatic first time, least likely case trigger strong immune response).**

Healthy immune systems learn better combat virus like coronaviruses, influenzas, etc... Reinfections happen, everything we're finding far, majority asymptomatic/mild. even know they'll widespread point. handful confirmed reinfections change this. enough data show trend all, small sample size. Especially consider everything else mentioned. first place knew site ok.

Have fun paying servers poverty wages blaming consumer dude. civilised countries price items high enough pay involved clearly that's concept advanced you, rather lie say tip everyone retail rather take board. 🤷‍♀️

Btw example euro shitiness American food establishment. wanted persuade people stay home, label trailers ""morgue"" set front city hall. hide behind medical examiner's building, put people see them. CFR indicator testing, mortality. New York cases testing, would expect higher CFR. get Trump far ideal situation exactly could differently right now? country divided kind cohesive strategy gain traction. Add amoral assholes taking advantage phenomenal investment opportunities throughout pandemic melting pot chaos really doesn’t want crisis end. Exactly. Thank Oh there's plenty blame government dumblefucks running sporting events, weddings, 100+ person parties, etc right now. we're obsessed partisan politics, whose ""side"" on. draws focus away agreeing ideas wastes time sides trying ""beat"" party.  change starting tomorrow.  Vote moron making covid precautions debate... basic precautions summer wouldnt talking lockdowns again... Actually, I'm Vietnam main factor full isolation society. Kinda like culling herd cattle, must isolate sick suspected healthy. one found infected automatically sent military / university / hotel isolation facilities remained fully recover. also employ third- fourth-degree contact tracing system aside infected, rest expected maintain home isolation close monitoring. found test positive sent away too. course things free living facilities.

People's full compliance help government basically went war propaganda mode drill people's perception severity regarding situation. 

Also closed border early (I think earliest world) every time global hot spot emerged (China, Korea, EU etc.)

We community lockdowns mostly ensure temporary isolation testing purposes. national lockdown April mostly full eradication efforts. people severe infections? reached point society obvious must buried. expect young people die covid-19 see headline like this, assume young person obese far, every headline shown case. We, least I, like think kids safe alarmed see story like this. look picture understand exception fits pattern known high risk portend serious involvements young people general, young people obvious (meaning instantly recognizable) risk factors. So, pointing dismiss death, explain set apart main group children way re-assuring large, children okay. understand: People can't hide symptoms included people told come symptoms. tested, there. It’s heartening see bipartisanship! Hell yeah dude! real. worst manager I've ever worked for.

Trivial discussions vibes going tend upbeat central topic sub. think real sentiment among log ""pro maskers"". like enjoy masking up, ""anti maskers"" clearly point can't live like forever. willing live like little bit though. \~1 yr initial time frame. Everyone feels differently, agree timeframe, we'd much better spot today. AKA, anti-maskers worn mask last 6 months gave today, we'd better spot today. Every day people wear masks enmasse, save lives. Plus France old world country much older buildings less prevalence working mechanical ventilation. bunch stagnant air old buildings. Actually, I'm Vietnam main factor missing comment full isolation society. Kinda like culling herd cattle, must isolate sick suspected healthy. one found infected automatically sent military / university / hotel isolation facilities remained fully recover. also employ third- fourth-degree contact tracing system aside infected, rest expected maintain home isolation close monitoring. Nothing explains Florida. Cant blame one Jews... shit Sherlock! Makes sense! tell stuck way nose got results 20 minutes lab onsite. claimed wasn’t rapid test. make sense ? LOL McDonalds? apologize eat places feed literally shit. European arrogance absolute worst. also took french patients border regions spring. Thank you! definitely give look. I'm tired shame tactics. can't isolate indefinitely. proven time time shame-based public health efforts effective, yet see governments, health organizations, colleges, administrations constantly tell people feel bad isolate constantly, matter reason. Plus 40 000 people already quarantine (active cases), need test those.  Thanks! one years ago major quality control issues filters (the red dye test failed sealant problems filters, according company) ended getting rid it. might time check though. Closes bars certain time. spread much want.

If goal ordered bars shut completely. grilled two whole chickens saturday great Grocery shopping actually fine. considered essential. Along going work, hospital, getting take out. remind people gathering. That's problem lot cases coming from. getting downvoted right. Hospitals overwhelmed everywhere. Early around April so, lot healthcare workers losing hours jobs work going COVID patients. separate hospitals needed COVID patients, prevent spread serve patients.

The point decent mitigation practices, like separate hospitals, places like worry ICU overcrowding. point? vote. Especially local elections. Everything Tony Evers tried help people shot republicans. Sounds like wage theft well. Really criminal offence. makes sense nation would characterized leader, especially relatively democratic nations. Calling ""a people"" distorts situation much, probably more, generalizing. They, including Trump, start claims like inauguration day. Trump make speech liberals, Biden, Antifa, etc. responsible COVID voting Biden going destroy America. base absolutely eat believe every single word comes mouth. Also, data many people died diseases past years, easily compare to?

""Excess deaths"" keyword data looking for. would ééé Bééééthoven.

Our vowels pretty much like Italian Spanish. 23k day Belgium. Population 11m. would make around 700k cases population US. want distance education.

Don't want mask wearing schools.

When kids get COVID, ""I take responsibility""  Sure, we're actively challenging immunity viruses way challenging bodies immunity virus mitigating controlling spread. PCR test accurate, especially already displaying symptoms. None symptoms stated really scream Covid bug spreads around fall. give rest. McConnel basically said ""No deals election"" Dems asking lot? guess helping fellow Americans think Dems completely fault this. #LoserAttitude US remained high it’s moved around place place. states ups downs similar Belgium (say NJ, population. Bad March April, went little, coming back again; etc) Fat kids greater chance serious case. obvious fat. cannot eat way kidney disease.  Truth told though Boris Trump 2.0 European Version. much changed. everyone studied immunology predicted works plenty viral infections well coronaviruses too. know might finally draw right conclusions what's needed get lives whilst making least (aka acceptable) amounts societal/human/economic damage? it, lot people don’t care. I’m self employed nurses coming business scrubs mask immediately saying sorry forgot fess aren’t wearing one they’re sick wearing one day, smh. 

Yeah cheers, I’ve covid already, tested positive twice get I’m fucked close again. yeah they’re tired wearing mask. wish police UK would start police masks now. Last time checked, common cold also come risk heart disease, strokes, blood clots, lung &amp; neurological damage, country remaining ICU capacity. authors article medical experience

The sample tiny effectively closes bars def impact specially 40 crowd driving current surge. feel bad! Silly little puns rough life sometimes, fault. Missouri nickname, called ""Show-Me State"". remember why, I'm lazy google it. curious, makes say ? people dead...how economy? Unfortunately, 9 people decide say “to hell masks” you, one says “ want mandatory masks” there’s much do.

Majority people don’t want wear masks forever. don’t care enough change live life. Belgian, I’m sure. lot people bend rules, another large part population follows them.

We masks mandatory shops 6 months already. almost people wear it.

Perhaps demographically almost Belgium one big city? 

Perhaps kissing hugging culture large parts country?

I really know affected much similar nations.

She's close changing professions actually. hoping nursing home (current job) accept cases again. nursing home investigation anyways office manager passed COVID son contacted OSHA. Guess care 2 workers 50 patients also perished contracting COVID took one admins OSHA start paying attention. think really important. people wear mask also meeting friends others homes? Plus contacts waiting PCR test even given appointment, one member family tested positive PCR, everyone stay quarantine even without test. I'm standing empty field wear mask? wonder people starting push back hard masks. non-sense. conclusion presumptive. (and still labeling speculation such) importantly, think, faster recovery = less time infectious. seen Barrington Declaration?

It really accurate portray anti-lockdowners uneducated. Stack ‘em high stack ‘em high stack ‘em low stack ‘em low Yeah, includes fair number governors Trump. guess didn’t follow science. Today, contact someone COVID-19 back March antibodies. person, however, spent several hours 3 days ago someone tested positive COVID-19 today. quarantine? Get tested? F makes immune system first learned incredibly violent is. Like total war levels carnage. Sometimes survive spite immune system, it. Autoimmune disorders suck. misleading 97000 new cases reported vs countries good available testing is.

97,000 new cases reported means roughly 97,000 infections previously thought were. matter whether cases show moment infected, matters exist all. Since insist pretending statistics: moving average COVID infections US skyrocketing that's what's bad. us reasonable mistake countries handling virus worse justification country's poor handling virus, care country handling virus poorly objectively care could prevented one group people insisted denying reality preventing reasonable, effective virus control measures enacted. Look death rates attributed covid based population 100k United States average better rest world. Why?

Because we're one richest countries world, relatively well-distributed, expensive, healthcare, several states obfuscating COVID-related deaths pin blame literally anything else.

Comparing US countries meaningless attempt distract fact US handling virus effectively virus' spread throughout country continuing worsen. That's 97,000 new cases means that's 97,000 new cases important. bungled understanding statistics testing plays relevant. COVID infections rising people infected, people tested. people infected, widespread testing would show increase cases.  simple. Oh yeah, remember giant Covid spike Massachusetts saw June July?

I hate bills come US.

The medicine itself. Great.

The abuse physicians providing care. Awful.   thought going twice 2 consecutive weekends. double test overcome issues anitgen test shouldnt it? Oh sure. remarkable thing human immune response. CDC guideline say quarantine situation. (Here: Unless exposed someone tested positive (or someone strongly suspect ill COVID like symptoms), would say quarantine. cautious, wear mask, like always. hate say problem face. much freedom think rights important someone else's. proven masks, Confederate flags, statues, smoking, etc. can’t say rallies causing spikes say protests aren’t. countless videos show protesters aren’t wearing masks wanted get together large group midst global Pandemic. say let hang folks month. Looking bigger picture help protect families home bringing home virus. Remember hundreds kids hundreds households hundreds jobs means contact whole lot people. else propose since disagree me? job losses massive, Victoria lockdown, doesn’t highest unemployment rate🤷🏻‍♀️ Also pushed limit gatherings back 10, made mask mandatory public times opposed can't keep social distance up.

Without enforcement though dead right, empty words say tried something. Thank posting this. Haha! Right? Someone Facebook page posted pandemic first got underway and, thought genius, didn’t think make username it! Funny someone already original? LMAO hope they’re putting good use! 

When see user name hear Busta Rhymes, “Wuhan! Got check! step place...” Fun times living in! Lol. proper researcher always understate, definitive proof. mean time, suggest would look better also qualify speculation such. contact tracing raised big red flag would thought, also say many people refuse give names. wonder ones hanging friends family want admit it. maybe undetected trend. mostly speculation part though. kinds stores open middle night are? Sounds like great place insomniac work strange hours. remember isn’t saying immunity six months, it’s saying immunity six months; it’s open ended right now. hate hate socialized medicine probably misinformed. That's fair, reinforces non-binary nature infection immune response. know fact wet markets caused virus hop animal human? 

If yes, illegal/banned yet? 

Most western world's handling pandemic piss poor, absolutely denying fact though. Baker Walsh nothing say abourt BLM protests Pride parade Boston throw temper tantrums 10 people gathered barbeque. know that, thanks; makes original point stronger. recommend countries enter lockdowns. consistently said key controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars flu, test people, trace contacts ensure positive close infected quarantined.

It seems strange remained silent topic first 5 6 months pandemic. beginning pandemic, scientists debated extent smaller droplets transmit COVID-19. “It’s difficult quantify somebody gets COVID never know person infected,” says Daniel Bonn, director University Amsterdam’s Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute experimental physics, who[ published October 27. “What try set risk analysis see likely get infected aerosol route.”  colleagues measured amount volume large tiny droplets produced healthy people spoke coughed, used mathematical models estimate aerosols travel air inhaled. Based findings, says, “It’s possible plausible route, it’s efficient route, probably.”  new research provides evidence suggest airborne transmission “improbable happen,” says Phillip Clapp, researcher Mucociliary Clearance Aerosol Research Laboratory University North Carolina Chapel Hill Center Environmental Medicine, Asthma, Lung Biology. “What shows...is aerosol transmission COVID probably predominant mechanism transmission, doesn’t mean shouldn’t concerned it.”  little project worked weekend. aim able show progression disease various parts country.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* see distracting that. go hand hand. manage spread contact tracing testing self isolation, need many large-scale lockdowns.

Of course, tests available, that's going work. Also, although failure individual case level, mean individual's failure. cannot isolate get assistance society make possible, society's failure. literally hands use without breaking law Absolute donkey, left late reference needs corrected. Immune response individuals corresponds disease severity. people getting fucked COVID 19 developing robust, long term immunity it. People shake head cold different coronavirus couple days really develop immune response.

Compare disease severity, coronaviruses. wouldn’t trust Russian vaccine. spreading point tiresome ""herd immunity"" conspiracy tell doubt reply Tegnell never explicitly said reaching herd immunity goal Sweden's strategy. absolutely clear that, early days pandemic, expected herd immunity result Sweden's approach, would result pandemic coming control Sweden. fact made specific predictions herd immunity would result infection rates peaking declining Stockholm (May 2020). predictions pan out, initial reaction surveys must wrong!

I ask this: practical difference ""hoping"" herd immunity one positive outcomes strategy unsuppressed (or barely suppressed) viral spread, making explicit goal?

Here's clue: countries talking herd immunity making predictions would reached. Tegnell? Bars *are* shut MA, unless restaurant also serves food cooked premises.

This order mostly get people stay home. real gaslighting: “you didn’t self isolate enough lock down”.... I’m bunch people forced go work public keep roof head. want people self isolate need make possible without becoming homeless think US can’t lockdown?

The reason think people won’t comply. got told stay home, it. worked together greater good. lips God's ears... Congrats! 2020 interwebs idiot year award! That's easy feat proud. 😒 speachless. Honestly completely lost faith haman race. approach like never fight virus future ones.   death count difference lot countries though? Look excess death. mean current total numbers Sweden complete shit (which Tegnell also said).

I also experienced hostility towards masks. Though FHM believe nearly effective do. Personally I'd want recommend right now. clearly solution pandemic reddit would make believe, important tool Bigly. Dont forget half people say take it. Bill Gates financed multiple production lines time approval distribution bottle neck. less one anyway. Ah see. Jets fan hoping complete Seattle collapse next year year matter . guys second favorite team. loved Pete Carroll brief time Jets. people like then, would better opening everything self isolated (which anyway), let run course low risk population. would back normal life long time ago. could continue flail away half hearted feel good measures people ignore know intuitively danger. even are, believe witness first hand. Hoping suddenly change course fall line delusional futile. Remember spike saw barbecues? Don’t need bars open drink eat large groups. see month makes difference not? tried point another redditor, (your last sentence) response was, ""No one's dying! wrong!"", soooo.... I've kind stopped trying pass information, facts, help really want it.  


It's sick really care causing another person die, point deny reality right front them... caring take them. :( “Taiwan, example, masks medical supplies storage. addition, almost two million masks day already produced end January, April almost 20 million day. meantime, still fundamental argument Germany usefulness masks - scarce resource made available medical personnel. Masks finally ordered China countries, desperately. numbers higher.

We people selfish preferred continuing seeing friends family without wearing mask. 

We test kids asymptomatic.
I'm pretty sure 2.5yo daughter Corona right I'm scared. super careful since march told schools safe. super sick bad cough 5th consecutive day fever. can't get tested kid. Reading health system may collapse scary. Great. handled, teach anti-masker’s kids. It’s silly say won’t take massive effort get done. socialize again? I’m shy around family? Yeah, sure is. Could also issue data hear you. private school chose remote option. Yet get daily requests in-person kids' parents inviting us homes playdate.

Um, picked remote reason??????

I go someone's house right reason. 

I actually starting wonder people able grasp basic science. 

Don't remember makeshift morgues street?!!! get it. truly don't. Wow, I’m sure Covid really starts spreading right clock hits 9:30. horror! types restrictions ridiculous that. mean, much difference business curfew really make? Hard judge him. many parents wanting offload students onto teachers failures government society general. Comparing Boris Trump idiotic. Yes, far let go? think that's stops? heard ""Covid cough"" since beginning dont think actually imagine life me?  live, gave contact tracing first weeks. people test positive, saying given instructions anything. even told try contact contacts themselves. Many people, understand contagion, incubation etc. really confused. Massive failure Public Health, although underfunded got overwhelmed early. Glad see good news Belgium. Good, closing restaurants virus .27% IFR ( world health organization, oct,14 2020). absolutely insane measures put place virus 99.73% likely survive. Isn’t herd immunity though? don’t give shit get system, leaving everyone else fairly safe cretins get infected pass virus? don’t really care, you? graphs? trump graphs?

&amp;#x200B;

/s Something teaching, would imagine. Enough this, issue greatly exaggerated; especially you’re mainly trying vaccinate at-risk people healthcare workers. think America free country world? Trump reelected. Yeah JATC switch back zoom classes trying person classes bit. dont know, whatever helps stop/slow virus I'm game. DeSantis kind partisan ass would likely shut Biden wins. US basically exposed don’t give shit workers it’s going define country decades come assuming people live end actually pushing change happen. blame anybody unfortunate contraction virus? That's meant, goal eradicate virus, reduce numbers Bruh shit never gets solved rolls uphill. Inc. (NYSE: PFE) manage distribution COVID-19 vaccine rather U.S. government’s designated coordinator, officials question whether U.S. adequate supply medical-grade freezers point use vaccines requiring storage ultra-cold different, just-in-time distribution plan. ship COVID medicine directly U.S. manufacturing facilities warehouses end users help trusted transportation providers, said Tanya Alcorn, company’s vice president biopharma global supply chain, Thursday webinar organized U.S. Chamber Commerce. That’s amazing illustration. Clearly people need freedom form privatized healthcare. wouldn’t calling ambulance cavalierly pay like USA

/s Technically correct, exhibits utterly dissociated reality respect people's lives. love ocean, jersey see !?! work Newark airport right now, everyone mask. Sanitation excellent. Newark airport gets bad rap time but, think really well. Thank you.


Couldn't easy time. continued mask usage required allow time vaccines manufactured, distributed, actually administered. take months vaccinate millions people.

Yes. people start get vaccinated, infection danger less more. happens, likely restrictions slowly lessened. Keeping mask wearing likely good tradeoff able things imo. Haha ""good news' flair. Bad news folks: way hell downloading Administering doses take monumental effort. 😅

😂

😭 Thank clarifying details me! short, smart mandatory quarantining, unlike 'quarantine home maybe' thing going Canada :// victim complex strong one. pandemic. want test youll get test

damn lines becoming interchangeable except sometimes infections worse second time immune system likely go overdrive, that's big problem COVID first infections, even. 

Or maybe initial infectious dose infection important swamps factors. 

If look confirmed cases, likely worse second time. that's small sample size. coworker got covid. management ignored isolated. need paychecks management knows turn blind eye. I'm glad still get paid. work retail first thing want vaccination hug parents, man. mom auto-immune disorder history lung issues pretty much self-imposed lockdown. Never ever forget company worth dying for. Whatever put first it. People recovered covid damage rest. personal experience think recover things proper rest support. lot cases often know proper support is. Look answers though. improvement even 100% improvement worth it.

Don't give up, try yourself. health, body really thing earth. Fight yourself. want heavy authoritarian responses things perfectly safe, welcome it. despite west's response single crisis, quality social, political, cultural life balance way better China's. I'll take faltering moment ""safe"" securocracy.  hear you. Like many health care use gallows humor get by. 

The truth though, refrigerated trucks going back service done holding bodies. Maybe people realizing make decide real. news antibody treatment new biopsy method deserve shout-out well. another end goal, gotta population control. laughed loud, I'd say comment accomplished mission. think telling repeat test coming months. 6-8 months still really early, antibodies present still likely risk lower. 

Still good data set course, it’s good know reinfection time frame unlikely... pretty short period gauge of. broken record titanic party going rebrand hindenburg party. posted times already.

But no, really. crazy that's thing now. XD guess notice much notice ""lockdown skeptics"" anti-maskers come brigade daily discussion. think enough brigaders target every single post sub, daily discussion, avoid congregate here. Hence difference. call lockdown unless there's lock? Like, people still going school, there's fines, there's LOCK lockdown temporary restriction. I'm even American get 😂 reinfection worrying, expected. We've got 24 confirmed reinfections 33 million recoveries. There's problem right now. man wear one day, it’s end world wear mask you’re visiting business 5 mins. You’d think nurses would know better though, yeah don’t care there’s nothing stop them.

Look anyway stay safe mate! Omg.... twins?!!!

Brother???? 

Yes, read every study came China, Europe here. Thankfully, medical journals gave us free access. 

I still gives illusion control micro universe. 

Ah, well thanks much beautiful writing. helped make sense mad, mad world. honest, causing despair (not understanding people kept upset it) helped ease troubled soul today giving much needed perspective.

I mean, karmic consequences huge never understood people understand.

My going getting sick could kill hospital nurse children orphaned. get someone random grocery store sick party innocent person brings nursing home people isolated, suffer loneliness die. children suffer. 

So much suffering. get sick reckless bar outing take hospital bed someone suffers heart attack can't get die. (This really happening - people dying hospitals turning away due beds filled coronavirus patients.) 

Or I'm irresponsible meet friends, get sick kids take school kill teacher. mean, possibilities endless harming others careless actions. 

People think lives hands time truly yoked together.

Everyone matters. It’s definitely still net positive though. Assuming that’s case, least cut severity coming years, enough people antibodies already.

It makes likely covid became another part yearly flu battles, least lower risk, especially we’re able make yearly vaccines viable option. sure did, since tried implement herd inmunity sick. keeps flipping sides opinions every month. Atleast one science based. Next month may suddenly declare victory covid again.. You’re also denying fact there’s countries controlled minimized risk covid want empathy people want drink get high. Countries controlled spread without locking everything down. yeah robster644 said ""next year"" imagining 2021 season China eradicate virus. information freely available, something leaked like state secret? Looks like we're back April 2020 Covid-19 status. see made progress contain thing. don’t think everyone rushing get first iteration vaccine especially given rushing it. Weird... leader first world country withholding Covid information public months ? think this: people get critically illl may soon longer access hospitals. means survive medical help get medical care, mean much higher rate deaths we've seen is. I’m Oxford study, got first shot yesterday. 30k people worldwide study. recently traveled Canada back US. entering Canada, asked describe quarantine plan customs. people plans rejected reformulate them. sure whether enforced, nobody checked (and adhered 14 day quarantine). least got sense airport could enforced.

When returned US airport kept waiting moment something sort would happen, didn't. Nobody even told quarantine. Many others described similar experience flying US. get paper tape don’t want fog glasses. Costs $3 amazon. put strip top mask. “ ICU 90% full“ ICUs always 90% full, hospitals double ICU capacity utilizing outpatient procedural areas. don’t know field hospitals used. risk population small. even winter yet - continue path we’re won’t long hospitals overwhelmed.

That means anyone heart attack, stroke, cancer, appendicitis, sepsis, pneumonia, broken leg, car crash etc etc, receive treatment bed doctor them. exactly

people need understand Yes, shall see order effect. guy fucking idiot. also zero regard human rights*

And yet 231k deaths. tragedies every single day Land Free inaction easier. Imagine putting life risk everyday trying save lives, accused corruption. statement idiotic cruel. Try educating automatically absorb every idiotic thing comes orange god’s mouth.  extended Mormon families etc? True, worse they're now. Without paywall: 5% upper bound. based good serology, could lower bound calibration done correctly people losing antibodies. That's good news.

I agree expectation herd immunity scenario 10x more, 2x more.

It's extremely worrisome Lombardy, 3 months worth extra deaths (roughly 0.3% PFR, though approximate, idea actual prevalence caused that), cases STILL doubling every week. ah makes sense internal international boarder closures, one state significant restrictions place (including masks), currently easing. NZ pretty much open, bar one outbreak contained. seem mind Trump administration lies everything related pandemic.  300k dead according excess deaths millions upon millions infections US. 

No one gives fuck China anymore.  amazing even communist regime able treat people better pandemic ""leader free world"".

Stop deflecting.  Stop arguing bad faith.  Stop pushing propaganda lies us favor sit shut fuck already.  People like precisely US complete dumpster fire people sick fucking death it. Literally. Yeah, number people I’ve seen get angry asked stay 6 feet away someone political opinions makes think we’re fucking doomed

It costs NOTHING, it’s painful, it’s inconvenience slightest. It’s taking time move line, you’d walked path anyway. Saying “no” saying opinion valuable someone’s concern.

I’m ashamed fellow conservatives. I've gotten tested twice major hospital area turnaround day. use CVS said could take 7 days IIRC. I'd call hospitals, clinics, urgent cares area see say. accurate? Jeff Goldblum, you?! observation made would rearrange number cases (46920), get 69,420. governor, I'd put whole state lockdown school closure, budge *inch* vaccine widely available. course, I'll also make sure continue mandating masks socially distancing even vaccine out, people get complacent. anyway, people vote system fucked represent interests. plenty people trying get fix hard locked inside house due lockdown day. 

you'd really well look decades economic, legal, social policies here, incompetence dude charge, contributing shitty numbers, rather saying everyone North Dakota stupid rube needs go stupid rube jail. reddit guess know expect. Kids spread more, schools shut. like saying okay piss swimming pool long shallow end. Oh okay, called ""new hoax"" technically call virus hoax, **BIG FUCKING every single decision trump makes terrible

Probably every single decision makes terrible. pandemic direct result climate change COVID pandemic global warming caused egoistic self-destructive human behaviour. think said lot first wave well, actually happening? Right resort “look mum I’m better ..”, vote better people real question.

Will ever let take cloth face again. Yeah week ago anxious, outside everything, bad lately feel like fucking around ""Better nothing"" kind situation we're facing here?

(I'm sorry ask rude questions) like YODO. people wear mask. Make clean covid hospital wards. Stupid question, sheriff receive police training? high enough fatality rate ever reach point Wow that's nuts. know stringent requirements run? better nothing. recall correctly, discussed Pfizer earnings call. believe ramping manufacturing/production get doses get emergency authorization.

Only one company, assuming others something similar get results third week November (again earnings call), it’s possible begin getting vaccine distributed beginning Mid-December. wrong, mentally handicapped. fucking goal posts. isn’t football game. Asia

Ah yes, Asia, favourite homogenous single-culture zone Thank you! feel like would take miracle point, could still pull together. I'm deflecting all. little children like demand things treated like little children demand things. always get want.

But yes, consistent testing assumption claim stated. testing changes CFR (which mostly measure testing) also. Stay safe, friend! :D Found fed ^ Haha yeah it’s hard sorry recovering covid feeling relaxed genetics Greek god , pretty bad strain. ""You need wear mask, we've put microphones everywhere. "" Psst... research article linked retracted. Best double check sources, bud. Also, even retraction, support ""50 years meta analysis"" claim. far, still looks like one lacking basic understanding science. Thanks source. want summarize results others:

- 133,266 confirmed cases
- these, 0.18% still tested positive 45 days
- ""long haulers"", 22.2% strong/good evidence reinfection
- risk reinfection therefore estimated 0.18% x 22.2% = 0.04%

Caveat:

- know precautions people taking. mean that, forgo precautions getting covid, chance reinfection would 0.04%.

- risk *re*infection compared control, i.e. risk infection. are, say, 0.04% 0.05% respectively, seem like there's much immunity contracting illness. 0.04% versus 0.4%, acquired immunity pretty good.

- looked cases 45 days. time passes, investigate risk reinfection changes. don’t think you’re really sorry.

No poner todos los huevos en una misma canasta Correct, snapshot infected last however many days. tested population weeks ago get another completely unique set people. taze USA! USA! USA! We're number ONE ! We're number ONE ! We're number ONE ! 

Oh wait?! chanting about! I’m liberal come giving credit credit due.

Dennis King followed instructions people like Dr. Heather Morrison also done bang job. working together, others, allowed us reopen stores, schools, take part Atlantic Bubble.

Yes PEI island Quebec residents traveling island way Magdalen Islands. We’ve hundreds people across Canada come summer homes island (many Ontario Quebec case numbers high). We’ve community spread instances matter. We’ve lucky enough enjoy local restaurants, beaches filled people, even Cavendish Music Festival changes. This. US better welfare system place make lockdown feasible 

Australias successful lockdown possible quickly job seeker/job keeper payment system implemented. 

Job seeker anybody unemployed need start looking new job. normal times get payment prove trying find employment got rid requirement now. think $800 per fortnight. increased payment normal temporarily also. 

Job keeper new still job few/no shifts atm. believe Job keeper paid employer pays you. heard employer abusing this. $1500 per fortnight.

And besides couple angry boomers yelling 'bUt eCoNoMy' nobody objected getting started ASAP. ""I can't think single event would want attend would awesome I'd OK 1 1000 attendees (or person close them) dying. ever anywhere awesome thought ""This great, even care kills grandma dude sitting front me.

i say i'd act it, yeah, nights would really tempting even current circumstances. Good. There's way many people near wear masks outside also keep distance. I've abandoned several walking paths normally take crowded people often unmasked. could “training problem”. give people enough samples positives negatives might start pick differences 6 feet larges distance range ""we that"". googled found rule influenza remember experiments confined spaces droplets found 5 meters away.

¢¢: rule is: Stay home. Keep much distance can, wear mask near enough spit people. already making god-awful looking coins holding captain America shield.

Childish. That's simplistic comparison considering:

- testing criteria are
- person tested multiple times
- testing method accuracy

For example, initially US tested people met narrow definition. tests almost always came back positive. contrast, Slovakia tested two thirds population 2 days found 1% positive.

Sure Germany may testing less, probably finding less positives per test. much indicative tests/population. Meanwhile neck woods life exactly ever. almost impossible grasp shown news reported thing changed 1 10 people mask outside. schools 5 days week, job busy ever, Amish still building barns houses jump FB , reddit watch news doom gloom. like blind someone try explain happening silent movie trust fact Russia ""already vaccine"" still outbreak thirty young given going halloween. can't wait he's fired.

Y’all “just know”? seasons relevant IUD placed first kid born, failure rate like 1-2%, well got pregnant mine.
No way hell, I'm taking chance ""some odd"" precent... would love blame leadership. do, extent. like mom blaming friend bad influence got caught breaking windows old abandon factory. might done without him...but one huck rock. Blaming bigger impeachment character blamed me. way morel center it, spine stand peer pressure well. C19 fiasco US, world managed infectious diseases like Ebola SARS1 source. different.

Yes, it’s different. Contrary popular belief, fact virus got foothold US failure current administration, inevitable. Covid19 comparable Ebola SARS1, *far* deadlier less infectious. Neither two pandemic potential, whilst Covid destined become one minute jumped animal human. problem long contact tracing. 

Yes is. wildly optimistic view contact tracing do. Say virus spreads animal person NYC. person remains asymptomatic, goes two concerts, five shops house party week after. 20 new infections. people spread disease unknowingly (before get symptoms) 3 random strangers bar, Walmart. None get tested, cause 20 *very* mild symptoms. 

At point people walking around infected society, majority untraceable, since strangers. way stop spreading exploding impose lockdown entire city. 

This scenario would happen monthly US. Contact tracing good keeping spread low, especially measures place (such limitation gatherings), ”normal”, pre-pandemic society, limited chance stopping outbreaks themselves. would say forever great thing. 

You realize way nations containing virus abhorrent, albeit temporarily necessary, violations human rights personal privacy. China population Orwellian surveillance, contantly ready lock people homes, really way keep check unless seal outside world like Australia NZ. 

None countries *do* virus check moment see current state affairs sustainable long term. 

Your idea impossible, serious scientific entity even entertained it. mean satisfied ""wear mask seated desk feel free remove breathe germs air day""? know Plague Inc., evolve virus well, cause entire countries fall? That's Sweden. 

Thanks ""no-lockdown"" strategy, country transformed desolate, apocalyptic wasteland, zombies rule streets, left brain-dead COVID's long-term neurological effects. Everybody wants eat brainz, one's even *thinking* happened economy. Sweden failed state rule failed states. I’m thinking need go lower ""That's can't nice things"" --WHO 

how even remotely news- Reddit-worthy? usual, biggest problems America always loop back towards greedy corporations. makes sad kids. Thank you! explains lot  whole thing really broke faith 'Western' society I'm honest. 


To me, seems like we've accepted extra deaths price business, we've effectively voted sacrifice people see significant personal risk personal reward, - understand manifestation pandemic battle fatigue, still represents fundamental difference way say East Asian nations handled pandemic vs us West\*, decided trusting individual make right choices using group norms bias choice selection. 


Sure, individual agency important thing. seeing collective results choices made individual agency here, looking great. think missing discussion fact we've effectively made choices people - individual agency at-risk group, reasonable choices have, virus high level around them? take away *their* individual agency? view, fair demand lock indefinitely get access hospitals, demand share burden. 


I really know anymore. naive glance could almost seen life cheaper West, would reversal we've often accused outside sphere influence doing. 


\*(Australia NZ really interesting exception sense good starting positions governments temporarily took much authoritarian/collectivist nature - even could see response early days along lines emphasising individual responsibility stop disease) That’s said. said universal mask wearing could allow controlled reopening. 

Then people began perverting message distract derail. See hospitals, fuckers! Maybe healthcare workers go strike. already wife quit job healthcare lack people taking seriously. Muscle relaxers target skeletal muscle tissue used someone ventilator body doesn’t try breathe. would sort “work against” ventilator timing wasn’t perfectly matched machine confirm. CHD take 81 mg day Enalapril too. “distributed” mean “manufactured” would distribution take several months it’s merely transporting it? order move Covid patients nursing homes states? Ok lol. problem assuming friends careful also friends see outside also careful. everyone sees friends arent seeing people thats 30 40 people could trusting remain careful.

One friend's thought taking virus seriously gone eat inside twice basically said ""we cant cocoon year"". get it, risking everyone else sees actions. people may make calculus internally much harder eat socialize outdoors think announce everyone hang with. Yeh agree. flu. Population urban density don’t change seasons. Taking trips time away probably common summer. 

The flu season never summer though. LOL nah son tell im part problem Send school sacrifice alter economy. Shame. incorrect headline. don’t know immune cells responding covid reinfection yet. know elevated t-cell production. questioning likely intentionally misleading information. kind person rejects that, outside intellectually dishonest one?

Seriously, hard imagine another reason whine hardly something, outside hoping shout censor skepticism.

Pretty weird People likely vitamin deficient winter months, socializing inside, dryer air. woman connected community pregnant contracted COVID. went hospital baby came early, healthy. mother got worse, eventually died. Tragic think lasting impact family. Preeetty late conversation, want say thank you, man. refreshing see someone calling idiots BS. Yes, mhmm, good call. They've discovered hours 10pm 5am virus deadly. rest day sorta deadly. sad think people totally ok without human connection. masks social distancing measures stay place least another year

Nope. Halfway next year I’m anymore. surely done contributors money. Great us! (Help us) bit context: BioNTech (who develops Pfizer vaccine) acquired production plant long ago production capacity 750 Million doses per year. That's 60 Million doses per month 2 Million+ doses every single day. that's one single production facility. include production capabilities corporations like Pfizer AstraZeneca others I'd wager guess capabilities exceed BioNTechs new plant. gain life experience college. that's something proud of. really depressing. Considering instagram stories looked like Halloween, confidently say next summer distancing vaccine lol We've caught one wild! r/ShitAmericansSay  Free tests usually limited cost much also slow (24 hours).

We need quicker simpler, cheaper. done airport, border, etc. said bragging emergency fund? opposite, asking country did. USA issues trillions bonds pay stimulus package, paying next 30 years. actually read said, would realize $1.7T currency circulation. pay stimulus cash would literally impossible. Thanks proving point :) know interferon used treatment people cancer multiple sclerosis - mean people less affected study? im starting feel tbh...even though im glad restaurant business, job 6 years since came back denver ""found myself"". havent without job income 6 years!

i structured whole life around it! every single thing. boss made deal chase bank buy property...i lost job. restaurant SIX YEARS closed. told im gonna take break 1 2 month most, holy SHITTTT....im already starting fucking feel it. 

I hope find something. went basically 360 420 EVERY week jack SHIT night. officially one month tomorrow o.o

so...i hope find something :( cause money gonna start running dry yeah get reopen colleges. 100% predictable. infections come gatherings bar/pubs/restaurants mask usage common. Yeah, even I'm vaccinated I'll happy see medical workers at-risk people get it. huge load mental state. thought said every country combined wasnt *that* suprised tbh freshest clothes, chillest restaurants, hottest dudes mean is, people refer things happened ""back pandemic"" time period ... unconsciously conceding think pandemic over. find people usually refer march/april ""the pandemic"". United States course. Imma edit clarity though, see mean. local hospital reinstated visitors policy today.

I wonder long kids go back remote learning/possible lockdown. getting bad again, especially counties closest us. everywhere else Rallies, concerts, protests...and people think catch virus see much people outside. True, though think MD would know actual answer whether aspirin helps not. course. That's excluded chose first country population 10 million. Another good article centrality super-spreading events Covid infections: OK get u I'm American, get rank armed forces keep even though longer in? don’t use numbers... /s  incredibly deluded. absolutely ironic, seeing progressive state government actually beat virus using science... haven’t lived you’ve Walmart midnight. Yes, lot hospitals close overwhelmed summer. Luckily able divert resources areas. recent surge may different suspected virus spreads easier colder months.

The mass grave New York several bodies dumped day. island typically used unclaimed bodies, morgues beyond capacity. yes, includes freezer trucks.

With PPE, we've barely meeting demands PPE recent surge. There's also reports medical staff reporting exhaustion. become manpower shortage now. biggest problem N95 masks shortage supply chain one intermediate product. Suppliers working getting new equipment online. Hopefully they'll running demand outstrips supply.  mutation makes spike stable. spike virus uses enter cell.

My comment side issue on. comment fact acting like children freedoms becoming liabilities, perhaps first time century might well better adult putting us time think done. 25,000 close contacts COVID-19 cases identified TraceTogether date, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong Monday (Nov close contacts identified, 160 eventually tested positive coronavirus.**

So app identified 25k close contacts risk, 160 virus. Singapore report total 58k cases means app responsible finding 0.2% confirmed cases (so far). small cost $$13 million (including SafeEntry QR tokens). “Taking trips spending time away home top two contributing factors COVID-19 growth, relative importance 34% 26% respectively. next two important factors population urban density, relative importance 23% 13% respectively.” Blame forinners, obviously Donald Trump dumb fat fuck survived maybe kids get it. pandemic plan left current administration Donald Dumbass got rid “bLaCk MaN mAdE iT”.

“I make absolutely apology whatever level best — level best government — avoid going back national lockdown,” Johnson said Monday, pushing back claims government moved slowly gonna troll, least right. never claimed rallies causing spikes? bringing Trumps rallies discussion?

I’m sure make claim countless videos showing protestors wearing masks. someone participated NYC ones several times, guarantee us masks on.

What’s portrayed media isn’t often representative majority protests, least experience, largely peaceful masks everywhere. Harper behind scenes pulling strings. LOL US government desperate look like they're something they're throwing money treatment weasel past FDA.. effective not.

This, plus bamlanivimab -- Eli Lilly's ineffective monoclonal antibody product -- repesents huge waste funds would likely better spent PPE production additional vaccine development funding. Honestly, know, limited understanding little column little column b. Wow politician believes science. Hey neighbor, I'm sorry guys anti maskers well. Try take care stay well. Europe still bad us comparison, though. agree Western cultural lens pandemic still going objectively difficult matter what. Obama Clinton Bush office, still would bad tens thousands people would dead. said, there's still big difference tragedy catastrophe measuring additional 150,000+ people died Trumps ignoring virus, medical expert advice, politicizing pandemic.

Thank everyone still battling fatigue inadvertently killing someone. quote that’s debunked? says right numbers used growing much greater rate actual ONS deaths. Iive outside Cincinnati, Ohio, get ""free"" tests, easy described.

There places offer free, referral required testing like described, however norm. Often travelling facilities they'll X site Monday, another site Tuesday, etc. permanent testing facilities, get busy, especially lately. Last checked one cincinnati (or one opening tests looked, 30ish minute drive away).

There plenty places offer free testing become symptomatic, still kind need doctor referral. generally call doc tell symptoms they'll give referral.

If close contact, hoops jump through. may able get referral saying close contact, may little tricky.

So get tests, definitely go clinic get test. 

At time, get it, we're place anyone reason get test, want focus symptomatic close contacts. got reported false info subs.

Oh, one people... fundamentally idea hell talking about, justify using anecdotal evidence understand.  He's living fantasy world. great example problem using wiki source. source New Yorker popular press article non expert.

I decided read 20 year old New Yorker Amherst College biologist Paul Ewald argues brilliant 1994 book, “Evolution Infectious Diseases,” normal circumstances mildest offspring flu family always triumph, people infected worst strains go home go bed, whereas people infected mild strains go work, ride bus, go movies. You’re much likely, words, catch mild virus nasty virus you’re likely run someone mild case flu nasty case flu. 1918, Ewald says, rules got inverted war. Spanish flu turned nasty late summer France. mild strain flu spreading soldier soldier trenches stayed trenches none soldiers got sick leave posts. debilitating strain, though, resulted soldier’s shipped crowded troop transport, moved even crowded hospital, every opportunity infect others.

The government really sent cloth masks every household beginning. would immediately normalized mask wearing early date minimized mask hoarding. 

You can’t dictate people do. incentivize too. 44.2% supporters 44.2% everyone US? got nearly six thousand dead Sweden thousands new cases every day now. population 10.2 million Australia 25 million lost less thousand. Australia also almost zero communal transmission.

You get antibody test Okay. Totally agree. border closure works. Sorry terminology difference.

However don’t think travel ban, correct definition, “seems work”. Banning specific countries like catching water hands. OBVIOUSLY don’t work. ""The lockdown ordered mandatory!""

""I think like that""

""Well shouldve tought shoudve locked voluntarily""

""That would make difference, still lockdown!""

""But would voluntary!!!!""

For makes difference give freedom someone takes it. One way another gone, unacceptable. That's slime operates - learned mob lawyer buddy Roy Cohn. Never outright say going shitty thing, imply heavily leave door open plausible deniability. Wait... feel free bash Obama stage? actually pre-rec bashing someone POTUS? 

Just curious... Reddit around back too. see PR department figures out... 

What PR department US back March given following facts: 
- know deadly virus is
- know spreads fast, know fast easily exactly spreads
- parts country plenty hospital beds available, getting hammered
- completely unclear treat patients (remember respirator thing?)
- know long pandemic last, but, wishful thinking, there's end sight
- know people able/willing fully locked long
- Medical professionals, Fauci included, already given vastly conflicted statement. CDC clueless, account potentially 180 recommendations future. 
- also account politics/economics plays this. 
- finally, simply people go ""fuck it"". ""fuck it"" crowd stupid, legitimate concerns. Feeding family keeping roof head legitimate concern. Making sure kids get properly socialized grow healthy adults legitimate concern. Mental health legitimate concern. 

You're underestimating complex situation still is... I'm law student Illinois will, minimum, spent half legal education online universities open back person class. hard, China style lockdown mean people's lives normal live lives normally. extend heartfelt sympathy family,""

Everybody smell bullshit mile away. There’s nothing horrible foods. It’s called moderation. mean feel necessary. feel that’s bit extreme. theory let kid cookie. entire box. too. chronic illness still work. going broke trying stay safe keep others safe, might get sick idiots. partner works three coworkers got covid going party together! Hang there. tried nothing work approach. I'm sorry see sooner.

I'll posting elsewhere too. even bad 2017 flu  perhaps vaccinated? Masking social distancing Little Rock. tons appearances talking Trump was/is asshat. time ask me... treatments available unfortunately, approves people going ICU real

The fact needs said email adults - statement like saying ""Apples grow trees"" - depressing. Oh changed tool. risk getting exposed risk getting infected, normal situations, people get exposed get infected. site said getting exposed 200 microCOVIDs per week translate 1% chance COVID per year, I'm really sure translates one-time activity. think tool useful comparing different options seeing one relatively safer. Take care! also agree this, child 2-3 normal, bit older allowed things like ice cream cake. otherwise create problem later make choices overcompensate. 


It's important teach kids eat healthy make good choices also teach treats perfectly fine moderation. 


The important healthy yourself, *show* good behavior around food. takes ONE person still it, vaccine think anybody unless test entire nation isolate positive close incoming travel. 

Jw determine though? don’t know situation surrounding child’s home life. Another comment pointed poverty’s relationship obesity. also strong correlation developmental disabilities genetic disorders, like Autism Prader-Willi. may late contained, mean give wearing masks socially distancing lower numbers catching it. *cough* read article data released states publicly daily. 

All data aggregation data usually accurate. sites like John Hopkins aggregated data high quality results. one relies CDC data. 

There cover loss data folks. known months months. article completely misleading trying get people think conspiracy hide data public never was. Yeah says 1 thing, doesn’t think she’s actually criticizing , let’s give benefit doubt /s saying sounds exactly like contrived internal narrative affirms wishful thinking. 

It's consistent Trump said done thus far. Even test negative, symptoms self-isolate home install app phone tracks location, turn internet/gps even second get panicked phone call asking turn back again. 

For 2 weeks virus? Fuck freedoms, go ahead, track me. like invasion privacy anyway - meant stay home, like they're nefariously watching go learn you. They're checking stupid inconsiderate dickhead can't protect fellow human beings.

You're completely right, makes despair people would kinda thing (complain liberty told stay home people die). would. friend manages health department N IL. received death threats. cruelest ironies (not intelligence understanding, luck) Trump right somewhat seasonal.

Then pissed away seasonal advantage absolutely nothing leaving us worst possible shape seasonal resurgence.  necessarily violate block it. lot sites realized easier cheaper geoblock even find compliant...let alone actually enforce comoance. That’s study looking at. looking amount viral RNA infected individuals. viral load innoculum initially infected them. wait there's vaccine? Oh yeah Western Europe really well. Stats facts don’t matter   know says it’s unlikely terminated position. Didn’t dig official result people fired job pension associated contentious “fired”. like private sector. chill care little bit

Source quote? person that's wrong literally everything US ""leadership"".  caregiver requires compassion, trait many Republicans seem lost. This. fuck 330 million people supposed coordinate pandemic response individually.... lot govt incompetence (every state bungled except like Maine). Blaming individuals (for eating wearing masks etc etc) easy don’t want think places allowing indoor dining + don’t mask mandates. like there’s support people stay home either (the one $1200 payment bunch people didnt even get) bright side , family food bill drop half. Unless die, no, go think minor sacrifice community &amp; country's well-being freedom taken away? realize sacrifices people made WW2 support war effort &amp; communities? recently become ""acceptable"" within certain group selfish.

If American, seriously get fuck country &amp; go live somewhere else. everyone patriotic, certainly need opposite.  don’t actually lead world deaths, well deaths per million actual statistic look at. We’re #10 according Worldometer agree could done much beginning currently! want take personal choice options avoid top nationalized approaches. Closer Sweden model. example. without single thought wider implications

Bit simplistic. thinks effects actions. others. says fire Fauci crowd supporters chanting it, gains support. talks loses it. issues result firing Fauci directly effect him, give shit about. strokes ego, it. really matter everyone else says him. mind makes move says something thinks super amazing, (in mind).  isolated 3 damn months till ran savings pay bills anymore. hell supposed do? gotta pay bills! guess could starve become homeless? Would help everyone? Sure wasnt fat ass killed covid? Boy walking heart attack 8 years old. good old American corn syrup diet. Mmmm.  paid lot people stay home. still paid stay home, end first lockdown furlough ended, people still going crowded beaches. 

No, evidence people beaches furlough, Occam's Razor applies think - way **every person** going enjoying sun totally ignoring social distancing someone furlough. way all. alumni school, surprised. Autism Prader Willi maybe responsible 1 1000 cases childhood obesity. Super true - parents made sure ate healthy younger - particular mom never let soda. got high school, vending machines everywhere filled soda junk food, part-time job! think fact played soccer every day saved me. Senior year also used stop Starbucks almost every single morning get iced caramel macchiato. don’t even want try adding amount sugar consuming day back then. Suffering alive 100%

Death virus young healthy miniscule, immeasurably small. par car accident etc. pleasure response food way strong people overcome. designed crave seek highest calorie food order survive. way get majority population healthy weight make difficult access high calorie food, like past.

We really missed opportunity giving UI six months max around year, pushing retail companies move online pick funding closed things like theaters depend large crowds. Okay feel like getting somewhere! started becoming widely cheaply available “Boomer” generation ... highly processed foods! also around invention tv. Y’all, things rarely happen “on own.” U.S. blindness influence large corporations truly wild. blame other/individuals things far individual issues. Thank you. aware. prescribed amount doctor low levels. won't. People accept kind bullshit much longer good reason.  Thanks! Thank  heard Lizzo radio say fat beautiful??? Paying tests means less money abscond with, heck thinking. Lol travel luxury. Sucks them. worth sacrificing health entire nation. Also return repatriate. New Zealand borders open early March still. obvious shit hit fan. people don’t sense return repatriate immediately that’s them. Hey /r/, anyone know whether there's database ICU beds (availability occupancy) World and/or Europe historic data last decade so? desirably week (or even day) granularity? I'd like bit BI dimensions time country. ""health database"", example, ICU stats end 2014 also yearly granularity. traffic deaths workplace accidents way down.


But deaths respiratory diseases? We've 340k far year. Less 7k confirmed flu cases. unless there's super deadly common cold virus going around know surfaced year, (spoiler, there's not) undercounting deaths COVID 100k, least.

And include people died home strokes heart attacks never respiratory symptoms. I'm really sure many are. I'm guessing know numbers way fact analyze stuff depth.

 Honestly, need to. read stats months ago expected vaccine said friends going tough sell, everyone, including majority sub, thinks vaccine=cure. absolute worst people scrutinize anyone living life. Went happy hour last weekend bozo screamed us “killing grandparents”. Mind covid previously, can’t spread it, live alone apartment we’ve decide ok taking risks. 

This social stigma disgusting. ok mate first thought too. merrier. 0-100 range referred bloodwork. totally okay clubs, bars, restaurants, music venues, sporting arenas, movie theaters, broadway theater, way flop none function social distancing years end.

Where people find jobs pay well enough live?.

Pay us taxes give social programs, working government laws. Well done Slovakia! could well become model countries too. different people use obesity tool push ""covid flu"" rhetoric. researchers think virus would spread among conservatives supporting Trump, never among BLM ANTIFA rioters destroy cities. Wisconsin also probably populous think. disagreement under-testing, we're &lt;6 million people, many rural. answer that.

&amp;#x200B;

Is perhaps data available people know look? Sure, one gets negative test live, public health officials say still isolate 14 days. Im infected today, get tested tomorrow, almost surely test negative, really useful limiting spread. True story little story above.  closing dad wife daughter showed huge sack McDonalds food. Dad eating double quarter pounder cheese got tend something. little girl stepped ate burger (after eating burger well).  comes back wife thought ""it cute!"" gobbled burger too. Also this. anticipate protests leading riots regardless outcome.  Obviously.

And pandemic waves reflection people's behaviors.

Ignoring pandemic far costly responsibly reacting it. countries need quarantine measures, contact tracing, mask use. Please note link posted middle east Columbia, though point relevant: 

Lockdowns run arent worse cure, may well people cant afford eat though id hate make decisions people starving vs dying Covid.

Locking Countries like Middle East link put shows lockdown may benefit people afford lockdown expense vunerable societies lockdown cant implemented properly. really sad - virus exposing flaws different societies.

But please conflate countries cant cope basic day day necessities able lock countries able cope lock downs citizens...don't want to. appreciate it, maybe open borders us K thanks Don’t drugs. help. hurt. Take old fart. would great idea except live Governor keeps saying ICU’s going problem every person know works actual ICU’s talking about, directly, completely underwhelmed opinion ridiculously overblown. wholeheartedly agree you. Vos Fitzgerald Tavern League running show.  Taiwan hasn’t closed border. test airport, get results airport. mean, nobody Wisconsin really taking seriously. People still going bars like normal year, people can't wear masks properly (if do). Fuck there's four different performing arts organizations Milwaukee putting in-person fully produced shows holidays. FUCKING still long period attempts create vaccines both, even epidemic period passed, attempts failed.  Also, “yOu’Re KiLlInG gRaNdMa!!” could probably get mailing list people interested attending live events generally send address day of.

I think could probably publicize list facebook, word mouth would get around.

Where Americans going vacation exactly? know world going tell us get stuff together let us come in. He’s thinking revenge. Fauci basically said Biden administration would listen health experts Trump administration went different direction. That’s closest he’s gone endorsing candidate right election. Ok. jobs require negative go back work. false much done it. America functioning state know anti-COVID practices working seems like they’re longer needed. Don’t open schools get nation-wide handle this, unless want lock borders down. Lmao. Even lifting boxes McDonalds standards. There's way hell identifying world emergency like pandemic none. 

And said it, China responded hard shutdown major city nationwide mobilization healthcare. early March. world watched raised eyebrows. Stop pinning blame like responsible slow response. Many governments chose downplay implimenting tiptoeing policies after. That's 'suggests' means (the implied alternative 'said' going fire Fauci, wrong).

It's clear enough fairly trivial I'm going get long dialogue it. article online live ticker corona updates Slovakia, important part is:

And yet, I've really heard messaging local public health agency daily news release. They've got maybe half-dozen comms people working there, best, they're focusing crafting news releases handling facebook/twitter accounts. 

They making decisions dramatically impact lives million people, give take, thousands businesses jobs, yet direction provide messaging supposed use either week later need (as business managers) non-existent. 

To points, course going ot say fuck it. rest, could far greater impact simply said:

1. doing
1. it
1. different said before, changed understanding virus
1. long think measures going place
1. pretty, simple, effective visuals show virus works, transmitted, protect family. 

I've conversations past week two separate people told me:

- children incapable contracting coronavirus
- impossible coronavirus without showing fever coughing

Seven months pandemic still completely false understanding know coronavirus. Beyond basic failure science education fundamental level, that's also failure get messaging hands people need most.

He's bankrupted everything ever inherited n=1 amount cover up/public blackout staggering. visited New England weeks ago friends brought local school two infected children prompted shut down. lamented shitty Deep South mudhole live in, they've changed laws *they tell many cases school someone infected*.

They blown away inhumanity. folks live Tennessee Memphis Schools 25% infection rate they'd consider lockdown. That's... unfortunate. He's wrong right, well corrupt immoral. Y'all saw overweight child lost got dang minds. Excess deaths people denied treatment hospitals due covid rules ie Cancer patients others due operations denied pushed back

Going need elaborate here. saying excess deaths people denied treatment covid rules? rules? people denied treatment due ""covid flu season going tally alot false cases annual flu deaths, deaths occur every year chalking covid.

Either dishonest now, understand mean asked excess deaths. need explain more? answer make sense otherwise. cause death largely irrelevant asking, deaths occurred, occurred SIGNIFICANTLY would otherwise, specifically started occurring right line covid outbreak. 

Whether covid confirmed cause death report irrelevant question. well good, locally super hard get tested. doctor's recommendation showing symptoms almost refuse test. Unless willing shell cash self test hard get tested. So, asymptomatic people running around spreading it. need better, frequent testing (which going drive numbers even higher). Lock downs going slow virus, stop it; rising numbers EU proof that. historically four large peaks 18 months got Spanish Flu, we're seeing peak three covid. Doubt time line peak count match, give us clue. live (Switzerland). Raw vegetables things like rice potatoes considerably cheaper meat premade meals. agree expensive necessarily (unless US stores sell rice vegetables they're grossly overpriced). Cooking home takes bit knowledge, though, time. yea places going winter. appreciate innovation safe Italy highest number since beginning pandemic right now.

The first lockdown worked, need another, dont kill virus completely off. people need follow orders Fantastic flu says can't spread it?

"" Dude, cannot control virus. cannot contain nature. ""

In contrast flood myth west, dominant myth China Great Yu Controls Rivers. echoed Wandering Earth, Earth doomed nature... (entire world) goddamn move Earth itself. belief nature \*can\* controlled probably helps attempting control it.

At least, however, appears say west. governments can't seem control virus. Unless we're Australia New Zealand, they're technically right near countries actually control it, fair enough. Don’t see happening. Ok, here's science. look national flu tracking data. report 12 (about early October/end Sep 2019, 2020 respectively, roughly timeframe) number lab confirmed influenza cases year date 298,120 2019, 21,156 year. locking Covid, also knocked 90% lab confirmed flu total, year date. 

Lockdown wearing masks works. smashed Flu season dropped Vic \~730 Covid cases day 0 3 months.

The current drop flu season ending. coincidental come complately control end winter, heavy lifting done winter. Flu, Covid-19 largely reduced/beaten year generally, 80+% people right/smart thing, listened health experts. 

You see graph clear second wave Victoria, lockdown stages put effect, numbers Victoria. gtfoh 'it's flu season ending'. sacrificed victory community, others. victorian lockdown one strictest globally worked.  elderly first vaccinated don’t see would pose risk them, unless it’s like flu vaccine realistically learn live covid.

And say cars worth risk? 
Well that’s level risk comes covid 19 it’s less dangerous car ride it’s precisely little interest taking vaccine. Actually no, Tedros elected China’s support. knows bite hand feeds him. That’s never see criticize Chinese government’s response even directly contradicts guidelines. really need read written respond instead making everything tribal game. think part problem virus last long, easily spreadable covid almost like system designed hold poor down. really kind annoy people act like kind inconvenience.

Wearing masks POE, distancing, cleaning keeping hands clean help prevent infection. Campus might neutral source data. Also possible pretty high mean pretty low comparison successful cases.

Masks probably mandatory unless lock everyone homes. means wearing masks might help fail criteria, wearing masks probably mean doomed fail (unless, again, lock people homes indefinitely) never responded I'll state common reasons I've seen:

1. want control that's governments do. want see much freedom take away using virus excuse.
2. Politically motivated, they're anti-Trump, leftists liberals using virus tool push agendas.
3. Doctors hospitals profit virus. get additional money assist caring covid patients, there's monetary motivation report coronavirus cause death.
4. Incompetence. tests inaccurate cause false positives. Additionally patient may infected influenza appears similar coronavirus, doctor fails perform test marks coronavirus.

I agree above, stating whether statement true not. I'm summarizing reasons I've seen.  Individual liberty must allow people affected negatively, can't individual liberty one affected negatively. One thing note is, basically voids one main arguments Covid non believers, keep claiming mortality much lower claimed huuuuge amount asymptomatic people. Well, experiment completely voided argument. number positive people around 1% nationwide, 3% hotspots.

So take consideration, mortality calculated based confirmed cases vs deaths far away reality. don’t want full lockdown. want people work. Actually, want government help people don’t choose lives livelihood. anything want people stop going parties, pick handful people bubble love god, cancel weddings selfish pieces shit. say hoax real blown proportion. Wow almost like acts like typical virus mystery space virus portrayed months opposite. highly infectious virus nose throat, much lungs. Vitamin D3 also assists blood clotting cytokine storm. fucking wearing mask base experience Kanto region Japan that's live, here... that's definitely wrong. Seeing people without masks extremely rare, definitely nearly 20% people maskless.  GENEVA — cold weekend mid-February, world still harbored false hope new coronavirus could contained, World Health Organization team arrived Beijing study outbreak investigate critical question: virus jump animals humans?

At point, three confirmed deaths Covid-19 outside China scientists hoped finding animal source coronavirus would unlock clues stop it, treat prevent similar outbreaks.

“If don’t know source we’re equally vulnerable future similar outbreak,” Michael Ryan, World Health Organization’s emergency director, said week Geneva. “Understanding source important next step.”

What team members know would allowed investigate source all. Despite Dr. Ryan’s pronouncements, advice emergency committee, organization’s leadership quietly negotiated terms sidelined experts. would question China’s initial response even visit live-animal market city Wuhan outbreak seemed originated.

Nine months 1.1 million deaths later, still transparent, independent investigation source virus. Notoriously allergic outside scrutiny, China impeded effort, leaders World Health Organization, privately frustrated, largely ceded control, even Trump administration fumed.

From earliest days outbreak, World Health Organization — public health body global remit — indispensable impotent. Geneva-based agency delivered key information testing, treatment vaccine science. Trump administration decided develop test kits, rather rely W.H.O. blueprint, botched result led delays.

At time, health organization pushed misleading contradictory information risk spread symptomless carriers. experts slow accept virus could airborne. Top health officials encouraged travel usual, advice based politics economics, science.

The W.H.O.’s staunchest defenders note that, nature constitution, beholden countries finance it. hardly international body bending China’s might. even many supporters frustrated organization’s secrecy, public praise China quiet concessions. decisions indirectly helped Beijing whitewash early failures handling outbreak.


Now, new Covid-19 wave engulfs Europe United States, organization middle geopolitical standoff.

China’s authoritarian leaders want constrain organization; President Trump, formally withdrew United States body July, seems intent destroying it; European leaders scrambling reform empower it.

The search virus’s origins study compromises W.H.O. made.

On surface, investigation virus’s origin progressing. Beijing recently approved list outside investigators. health organization agreed key parts inquiry — first patients China market’s role outbreak — led Chinese scientists, according documents obtained New York Times. documents, never made public, show W.H.O. experts review “augment, rather duplicate,” studies undertaken China.

Even heaped praise Chinese government, organization refused disclose details negotiations Beijing hasn’t shared documents member states outlining terms investigations.

“The W.H.O. prioritizes access country,” said Gian Luca Burci, former legal counsel agency. “But bitter end, lose soft power.”

The question virus’s origin remains critical mystery that, solved, could help prevent another pandemic help scientists create vaccines treatments. first SARS outbreak began spreading China late 2002, officials hid epidemic months. finally acknowledged it, soon allowed international teams investigate animal source.

This time, hunt source shrouded secrecy.

Internal documents interviews 50 public-health officials, scientists diplomats provide inside look disempowered World Health Organization, eager win access cooperation China, struggled achieve either. solicitous approach given space Mr. Trump allies push speculation unfounded conspiracy theories, deflect blame mistakes.

The prospect apolitical inquiry virus’s origins dwindling. China extracted concessions health organization helped country delay important research spared government potentially embarrassing review early response outbreak.

“Unfortunately, become political investigation,” said Wang Linfa, Australian virologist Singapore helped identify bats hosts first SARS coronavirus. “Whatever symbolic.”

The organization said committed full-scale investigation irrespective political distractions.

“Divisions within countries provided fertile ground fast-moving virus grow gain upper hand,” W.H.O.’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said statement Times. said political attacks undermined world’s response. “Leadership crisis requires listening, understanding, trust moving forward together.”

The question Covid-19 began especially intriguing initial theory, centered illegal wildlife sales Wuhan market, doubt.

There powerful evidence new coronavirus passed naturally animal humans. Scientists found virus bats close relative, suspect may infected another animal species reached people.

But though agree many cases linked market Wuhan, many scientists longer believe outbreak began.

For now, however, it’s still trail goes cold.

A Contaminated Market

On night Dec. 30, according local reports, workers protective gear began scrubbing Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market Wuhan, warren vendors selling produce, meats wild animals. scoured market, going stall stall, spraying disinfectant stop outbreak officials believed originated there.

A day later, another team arrived China’s Center Disease Control Prevention. According one official account, experts took samples products sold market environment.

But three weeks later, George F. Gao, chief scientist China’s C.D.C., indicated reporter market closed team could conduct thorough search animal source.

This key moment. discrepancy accounts leaves open two possibilities. researchers tested samples live animals, may concealing potentially important clues origins virus.

But arrived market closed disinfected, may taken samples places like door handles, counters sewage runoff. Many outside experts consider likely scenario. said understandable local officials, focused preventing human illness, would rush clean market rather pause preserve evidence.


Yet would mean Chinese officials probably missed chance confirm outbreak did, not, originate.

The W.H.O. repeatedly said investigations underway done little clarify uncertainty. Chinese health diplomatic officials respond repeated interview requests publicly silent happened.

“This part Chinese psyche — demonstrate world best science,” said Peter Daszak, disease ecologist president EcoHealth Alliance New York. “But case, didn’t work. think reason don’t know much more.”

Identifying source virus armchair exercise. 2012 outbreak coronavirus MERS, scientists found evidence carried camels. took researchers like Ghazi Kayali, drew blood samples Egyptian slaughterhouses, confirm that. researchers eagerly awaiting details China’s early tests.

“What actually find?” Dr. Kayali said. “Was live virus, fragments RNA? sample animals present there?”

The closest Chinese government come publishing findings Jan. 22 news release, declared scientists found coronavirus 15 samples market. unclear whether virus shed humans animals. Chinese scientists published genetic sequence samples, information provided clues virus’s origins.

The W.H.O. may position answer questions. mid-January, China’s National Health Commission briefed organization’s local office market investigation, according official direct knowledge briefing.

Chinese officials said January outbreak began market. Dr. Gao, Chinese C.D.C., blamed illegal wildlife sales.



[...] Uh stop listening government overlords start thinking yourself. Unless involidyou're going die. Yup. I’m giving pandemic year.

But also Halloween actually went year pretty fun. read pangolin bats, wet markets. knows? 

And basically going 13 year old emoting: upset literal Chinese people ""gross"" eating stuff, turned terrible pandemic.  eat meat, especially bad. IDK.  even want throw stones wet markets, cuz serious fuckery going animal processing plants here. 

Personally even feel *more* upset Chinese government bullshit pull. sort added big pile. quote relevant models saying happen 10 days. So, 10 days, two choices available: Transfer patients Germany hope triage…. we'll triage. [That means] one bed remaining, two patients. doctors choose one two patients able bed have. That's triage. Usually, done terrorism, war, catastrophes like nuclear explosion.

So they'll transferred Germany, people get care, another hospital system days collapse collapse, people even less trust hearing story different places around world wolf cries never coming fruition. infection rate high enough, hospitals still overloaded even ""significantly reduced"" rate serious illness. Hoping finally get Patriots ticket mediocre team. This. Idk “ran out” right word. Assuming you’re talking US, is. say iirc dumped large businesses beginning without batting eye, likely haven’t handed nearly much actually need (the individuals). 

Our country funds take care citizens. simply refuses so, charge 1) worried it’ll make people “lazy” 2) falsely believe (or least want *us* falsely believe) money fact “tRiCKlE dOwN” spreads enough, eventually get people vaccine really effective. hospitalisations reduced by, say, 80%, *still* overload high enough case counts. Well continuum things, capacity provide care majority folks need intensive care would surely qualify.

See GracchiBros comment thread definition used President Belgium's medical union. think folks late getting vaccine shit ton danger folks feel less danger careless distancing masks. 

They targeted roll limiting folks 70 first PhD thesis virus specific memory cells. still think pretty likely eventually able reinfected virus (just like commonly circulating could become reinfected COVID-19 would make unlike virus ever known history epidemiology. 

That's even close true. viruses give life-long protective immune response. ones way induce antibody response lasts decades. cells great, preventing reinfection entirely do. think people know this, though. don’t know specifics boy obese, we? intake many calories body process burn may portion story. Hormones like insulin, cortisol eating disorders huge contributors people end obese staying obese. simply assume it’s strictly simple caloric intake disservice him, talk obesity epidemic. 

And say statistic mind 80% people lose weight end gaining back more. It’s cut dry. Yes motivated lose weight, lose it. what? Sure, may 20%, happens 80%? 

This it’s super important label obesity medical condition needs interventions allow long term treatments instead seeing like easy short term problem fixed simple solution. easy fix wouldn’t situation. misunderstand me.

I mean numbers older 10 days reliable. latest 10 days reliable, deaths counted retroactively. person dies particular day take 10 days death registered.  Plus, multiple parties makes everyone cooperate better. talking about? graph covering half year. delay death reports (ie weekend early week numbers get reported wed-fri week week) pretty irrelevant. start going corporations actually causing climate change, locking everyone houses forever fucking eco-fascist people retarded inconsiderate ass holes. know man tested positive COVID still went shopping supermarket. cunt. Get somebody else get food take advantage home delivery click collect services. millions stupid inconsiderate people earth im certain made pandemic much worse. People ever fuck want care rest us. Blanquer (Education Minister) lowered health procedures mid-september 'cause many schools closing COVID reasons, he's virus' best friend. Still things remain relatively unchanged, stores open, roads full. get much worse El Paso. “hoax” implies hundreds thousands dead people overblown. Yeah really sucks. I'm sorry hope paint Christians broad brush feel like know exactly type I'm talking about. funny oligarchs win either way: back salt mines poors (sacrificing granny along way) scarfing sweet sweet gummint corporate welfare nothing. need outside box thinking. Thanks posting this. Thats completely different subject. getting party friends family, people ""sacrifice "" another July 4th? 
 
Take look 1918 pandemic follow timeline. matching nicely. 
 
And narrative shifted im getting vaccine done Xmas. flat-out less likely people getting grocery shopping, though. Reporting bias issue. 

Otherwise, would seeing major spikes least constant rate grocery stores basically thing open.

Think it. going safer place shopping almost everyone mask entire time mostly distances 20-45 minutes event multiple hours people constantly going without mask drink/eat, talking/shouting loudly other, fun happens party.

It's almost even worth worrying infection shopping masking washing hands touch face. Doubly people morons too. lots evidence point agrees this. Well it’s stay, bother wearing masks social distancing? Thanks! didn’t realize changed it. thought typed thing expert criticizing...You self isolate. people usually lockdown. Self isolation may risk maybe symptoms, contact someone tested positive. That's really interesting. theories, really, though wonder testing capabilities accuracy cause death information places lack decent healthcare, wonder areas much higher death toll virus numbers reported due aforementioned poor care/corruption, etc.

Though sit think it, mentioned younger population could part it. also wonder cases pathogens common areas afforded immunity COVID (heterologous immunity). According one article: ""Heterologous immunity relatively common within closely related species also seen unrelated agents. demonstrated within various groups pathogens, including parasites, protozoa, bacteria, viruses, also highly divergent groups, bacteria viruses.""

Could mean that, especially lower-income/poorer countries, there's exposure pathogens usually encounter areas better healthcare, different climates. suggesting China, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc., closed borders, restricted movement countries, that's reason well COVID poorly restrict traffic? (that's billion people, probably five times size US?). Lots selfrighteous comments, expected. people seem takes counter virus never commit mistake distancing measures. wear masks bothered human too. want enjoy life. could well die tomorrow know selfish previous epidemics? debts grown unbearable rates. long going pay that? Maybe would worse lockdown see conclusive studies reaction virus effective reaction led result. blurry care people affected virus. naivety gloom us want enjoy lives deprived rare moments happiness sad times. much self righteousness apathy really makes think redditors either hypocritical apathetic. Source ? monkey trials again? social distancing several years

Hell fucking no. It’s man made disaster actually. Leaving aside moment shouldn’t way... 
The federal government constitutional authority national mask mandate, constitutional authority quarantine healthy people. 

Like not, legal system requires states job. 

And, leads things like ... NY massive case load (which still worst world), threatened sue states required NY residents quarantine... NY requiring travelers state quarantine. 

Sometimes, humans behave like bunch rats. Damn amazing news Again, saying component, think main driving force. People need go work would want stipend/stimulus reopening. People want go reasons would want reopening instead (or addition to) stimulus/stipend. coughing 4 days straight couple months ago point still feel effects, wonder could covid, dry. Covid pretty high survival rate. Depending age conditions risk health low. mean, fucking epidemiologists convinced late stop paying attention. 
Only mitigate/slow there’s vaccine theyre veryyyyyyyy expensive  Thank you, always struggle words 😅 . Trust me, dems voting. Trump going around country encouraging everyone vote cause knows too. It’s also hilarious poorly rallies planned leaving everyone cold 🥶. got woken last election voting  weakening quantifiable way? [We middle second lockdown say Realistically math make sense. highest. Multiple countries reported 1.5% higher. 0.6% USA! USA! USA! read FDA set bar effective coronavirus 50% efficacy. also don’t think people really know consider “50% efficacy”. look flu vaccine efficacy sold us:

“The first Cochrane review looked effects influenza vaccine healthy adults 25 studies conducted single influenza seasons North America, South America, Europe 1969 2009. found vaccine reduced chance getting laboratory confirmed influenza 23 cases 1,000 9 cases 1,000.

While seems reduction 50%, seems less optimistic expressed absolute terms.

The infection rate adults drops 2% per year 1%. could say that’s halved, effectively drops 1%. means every 100 healthy adults vaccinated, 99 get benefit laboratory confirmed influenza.”

Quote people entering Slovakia generally required quarantine show negative test result/get tested border? first time last fall Houston visiting friends. Man... taco's punch! swear days think flying get damn taco's. Africa 1. Median age 19, 2 lot's sun neutralize virus groups claim 10,000 people showed party group claiming responsibility 

idk say that, set Erik Little's group he's pretty vocal about. expect Western culture lockdown 6 months?

Keep dreaming. Good time get oxygen business immature think. ""But want,"" really core. Really? experience all. live Lincoln Park/Lakeview area. ... difference inaudible humans. Thanks reply. right first time- may locked :) It’s left’s fault crazy gas lighting population push whatever narrative suits needs. It’s permitted suggest animal sources virus? kind both. cities (Madison, Milwaukee) access excellent, convenient encouraged. 

Outside those, though, testing done massive scale, predisposition counties outside major cities seems lean heavily ""denier"" direction, thus stipulating tests done necessity alone. Yeah, doesn’t get points basically fucked entire country ass. Pay fine time guess ways would make sense people India often younger, better diets, get lot vitamin spending time outside westerners, built immune systems less clean conditions, probably able deal virus better westerners. education emotional maturity. There's really immature educated people react like 2yos told put seat belt. yeah, got lot snippy comments husband went back work April home two weeks - unpaid- son. works construction yeah, can't work home. I'm lucky enough job primarily work home anyways pandemic, wtf - want us go one income new baby medical bills coming way? husband safe job site luckily line work - painting - allows pretty secluded others, also wears precious N-95 masks everyone wants days part day-to-day. people like, judging working sat home cushy work-from-home jobs really frustrating. reply veered wildly off-topic original point policing. also disagree pandemic ""Utopian dream"" Capitalism. Small businesses greatly matter capitalist society. french lockdown, lost jobs 75% salary paid state.

Business ask state sponsored loan reimbursed next year

It still hard small business self employed people, 
But least lost job still pay rent claimed would seasonal. wound seasonal. means correct. it. Nothing more, nothing less.

If said sky blue, would say wrong everyone knows blue. would silly. life Asia? Oh no, let’s bring success stories. I’ve unemployed since January project manager let bunch people team go. virus happened. unemployment benefits? run certain allotted amount time? go away first place?

Fuck US Government OK... we're told Swedish people obey ""recommendations"" law, rather making law forcing people stay home, simply recommend everyone stay home four six weeks, pass laws saying anyone follows recommendations receive compensation (as employers)?

No problem constitution then, Swede's obedient FHM claims, effective, right?

It's economy, cost factor, trying achieve herd immunity, stopping spread virus would good thing...

So, not? democratically diluting power vote moving key decision making abroad union that's beyond accountability british people. socially opting pursue destructive immigration policies intersectional race based politics brought terrible consequences poorest vulnerable society.  Yes didn’t like accusation hey agree it’s novel virus don’t know shit. think agree risk low there. Let’s end catch time Key quotes article:

"" recommend countries enter lockdowns. consistently said key controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars flu, test people, trace contacts ensure positive close infected quarantined. ""

 "" 'For me, big missing link what’s going many European countries management isolation,” said Dr Margaret Harris WHO. “That’s isolation people sick – it’s isolation people contacts first-degree contacts. ' ""

The point article need testing effective contact tracing people know positive, come contact someone positive, symptoms. need self-isolate.

The point everyone self-isolate (that's unenforced lockdown). think lack access testing? think people kind denial, feeling need go get tested unless gets severe  kidding partisan yourself?

The democrats china town NY asking people hug Chinese republicans blocking travel. 

The democrats blame republicans enough calling racist anything. 

Police arrested church goers cars outdoor car service joe Biden exact thing events. 

BLM protests seem perfectly acceptable events, masks social distance. anything, shows selfish humans prioritize personal enjoyment protecting society weaker. yet. Although DeLuca thinking something similar. likely travel regions reduced ""urgent"" needs similar things, region lockdown. Bear mind Campania (Napoli) Lombardia (Milano) two regions biggest numer cases, may locked (lockdowned? locked?). can't find detailed stats age gender, think available later. Americans can’t afford $1000 emergency

Then can’t afford go fucking bars sporting events rallies restaurants. don’t blame anyone needing work, keep ass home otherwise. Keep mind wearing mask protect protect others, including immunocomprimised can't take vaccine. Try good person vaccine cuts infections deaths flu-like levels isn’t good enough return normal life? soon remotely safe go back normal it, can’t live like longer. I'm hoping thats true.

Democrats need win 3 branches force law allows voting day legal holiday make tax credit something make people actually show up. change policy doesn’t mean pandemic over. pandemic RESULTS change policy seen measurable decrease infection rates. 

I don’t know that’s hard people understand. Yes education part mentioned emotional maturity too. Lots educated people childish anti authority can't even tolerate simple rules emotionally 3 years old saying ""no!"" find kind perceived parental figure mind. life now. Get use it. can't afford children them. Awfully condescending you. Here’s CDC’s info flu vaccine effectiveness.  mean, people/sq km, maritime provinces higher population densities BC. Obviously tell whole story, like there's nobody here.

Also different reality? Come on, pandemic that's touched pretty well everywhere earth. really fair write success Atlantic Canada like pathetic people need literally spelled them. Even pathetic ones still fucking get it. stupid ass getting fired tomorrow wearing mask infect you, fucking turd. long spit face, fine wearing mask. I'll take chances. get back jerking Biden ads collecting disability binge watching 600lb. life thinking somehow better folks 🙃 Don’t worry us sane know letting deadly virus run rampant isn’t smartest take report said *did* detect it, even asymptomatic people. right article: ""The way produce sound changes Covid, even asymptomatic.""

So need someone already sick coughing, apparently many asymptomatic people still least minor damage lungs, AI able detect asymptomatic people asked cough mic. completely fine believing anything without evidence. reminding although evidence longer virus respiratory areas like lung, throat nose, scientists can't tell yet virus hides places body. 

Just forget fact, even though respiratory system cleared right now. let *anybody* talk taking care yourself. many people willing push eachother bus. okay like me, accuse one people willing uhm, push people bus ;) Depends source. I'd suggest ask another rona sub permitted discussion here. Well, mail ballots need counted result known Another one?

Are ever gonna see things rolled en masse? 

Feel like hear quick testing yet nothing actually feesible large scale time soon.  Lol wrote another long comment people dumb can't trusted make good choices. mixed bag. know there's someone would come work flu can't afford miss work. much nicer area me. ignoring base issue people enough money eat told can't work 14 days. mixed bag, bad. new person charge, new policy, new vaccine means little

These things mean everything that's exactly less people come sick hospitalized. Literally new leadership multiple vaccine candidates change nearly everything better. True 75% effective good enough return normal financial aid huge thing missing USA IMHO. think way people, even virus skeptics, would willing comply stuff like distancing, limits crowds masks entire livelihoods risk result it... hard tell people close business source income weighing risk years penury vs. catching disease likely die from. saying right take one way other, saying fully understand people feel way do. exactly. :D well, could lie.  They're trying ""whine away."" think going go away. They're willing take risks. clearly becoming common sentiment.  That's good hear. Hopefully holds. gotten sick otherwise since? Posting articles March altered title isn’t sub allows. Check rules That’s fault ""talk modders"" us agree delete users' comments, that. OMG, irony charts. Broadyway = Covidlandia (right now) whole point wearing masks times prevent asymptomatic spread?

If vaccine allows asymptomatic case, that's acceptable sudden, there's reason wear mask unless sick. also get Imagine cover celebrities spotlight lives? people want!? /s kid fucking died. Don’t dick. Actually primarily do. Almost every vaccine supposed mimic spike protien, introduce body body learn fight better. different natural infection, really apples oranges. 

We still may need multiple vaccinations though, primarily T-cells might enough provide protective immunity assumed majority English speaking people reddit seem US. It’s almost automatic assumption everyone US based (I get assumption thrown time I’m not). it’s well known isn’t universal free healthcare US unlike many countries. I’m glad get free COVID test. realise raising minimum wage all?

""We are"" ""we did."" guess sucks people new wage kicks in, cool. contrary birth sub. actually bummed fuck whole month April. Lockdowns 2022, treatments remdesivir, early vaccine trials beginning considered poison heresy. optimistic voices overshadowed drowned negativity doubt. Things different ""end"" horizon darkest sub got darker. Belgium still create extra ICU capacity, problem can't get extra doctors nurses longer peaks doctors nurses drop out. 1200 2000 bed ICU capacity. need accurate cause death.

And yes charts expected death rates vs actual find. Actual corona deaths around 330k think going work, everyone knows people go work. possible work done remotely. possible, work done proper protection well. 

The problem things. parties, gatherings, dining out, weddings, etc... recommends lockdowns economic affects. Trust scientists guys... isn’t supposed do?  state gov announced heath department deemed mask wearing efficient someone tested positive masked on. reason quarantine test symptom. Funny far truth. Considering headed flu cold season, something distinguish everything else covid help people make rational decision whether need quarantine head work. China actually notifies public places covid cases gone. 

They like Matrix level contact tracing, using Big Data superstalk people. 

And lie, u r big trouble. 

And also government constantly sending announcements, local citizen cooperates wearing masks. 

There people believe virus hoax well china side-ism media given platform. 

Also total social media control. try spreading something like Plandemic online presence probably gone second. people everything right months somehow show effect.

This completely wrong irresponsibly paints picture implying there's point right hit hard anyway.

France reopened pretty much summer. example, restaurants fully reopened (as in: indoor seating) since June; schools also. Sweden delay much volume reports decentralized structure administrations multiple steps takes report death nursing home national level. hospital deaths reported almost without delay, ones happen outside hospitals usually take longer time two extra steps reporting. Sweden. they're great, without destroying country  MFW humidity low house month wake dry mouth. 😱 hoping Trump would reconsider selfishness noncompliance contracted virus himself. Alas, case... Republican one post collegiate adults president taking seriously, would think average college student would? assume produce quite bit since one dose 0.5ml. million doses would 500L vaccine. Ok little bro keep crying abt Pretty much western northern Europe + Japan. feel sorry rest world. Vote. Please. Sincerely, rest world. Look youtube Diamond Dave Princess Sally. covid February essentially livestreamed whole thing cruise ship cabin. Every day, sometimes multiple times day exposure first GI symptoms, admitted pneumonia eventually recovered. Nice old Brit couple 50th wedding anniversary trip. love authoritarian governments much, move... Nobody would. Lol Forgot tag And? happens non-EU countries: Genocide dictators killing people. 
EU countries: Natural disaster. 
This woman queen hypocrisy. Hmmm Maths again... Dude, we've video coverage overwhelmed hospitals since 2019. saw coming wrecked Wuhan. got confirmation unique China completely overran Italy Spain. proved ""American Exceptionalism"" provides immunity kicked *shit* New York. we've 8 months hospital workers *literally* working death shouting ""THIS JOKE, STAY ***FUCK INSIDE***!""

And far we've done help cheer balconies them. morning trying sleep. *so fucking glad* I'm medical field right now. Kinda hard proper policing months anti-police protests. even read article? Antibodies source immunity. US constitutional restrictions Federal Government do. think would Constitutional Federal Government tell store sells products state (aka 99.999% stores) require masks get closed duration Covid19, instance. Federal Government could require individuals wear masks-however Federal Government could deny highway funding states meet Federal mask guidelines. 

This US Constitution since born, know Canadian Constitutional Law, sorry. Ratfuckers, lot them. Go Slovakia 🇸🇰!"
