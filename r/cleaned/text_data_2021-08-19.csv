0,2021-08-19,"    Let’s deny care std’s people don’t use protection too!! Obviously not, FB everyone tells ""just 1% death rate"" ""vaccine leaky, harm DNA"". first time people talk anyone idea reality they're ICU intubated. That's last year. year get daily email saying many cases yesterday instead. No. don’t need show ID many states. everyone even ID.

Your making crap up. really understand posts political comments removed. *all* political point. Fuck 'em. chance, chose death/illness. need respect CHOICE mean unvaxed? Well, district via email. companies/institutions administered vaccines definitely kept records, part process, account them, even ones threw away. That's anyone verify card without access medical data, call people administered ask vaccine lot listed card play day. definitely incorrect. far given.  you’re vaccinated don’t actual medical reason get yeah you’re fucking plague rat also wish you’d die everyone like (your disease, mentality, ignorance, ego) danger society. What's point masks social distancing there's way anyway?  I'm pretty defeated.  I'm vaccinated, trying live life, patiently waiting anti-vaxxers die. I've sacrificed enough 70% effective infections, 100% effective hospitalizations original clinical trial don’t think it’s soon ask? said almost died stepsis…. likely eventually, dropped mask mandate couple weeks reinstated. wasn’t even dropped numbers far, far lower recommended threshold.

I don’t imagine mandate changing cases across country stabilized.

Regardless, mask usage consistently high here. Even mandate dropped, 99% people wore mask indoors, besides bars restaurants obviously. (AP) — Three senators said Thursday tested positive COVID-19 despite vaccinated, high-profile collection breakthrough cases comes highly infectious delta variant spreads rapidly across United States. Almost every member Senate spent long hours together chamber’s floor last week all-night session budget votes leaving town August recess. breakthrough cases emerged day U.S. health officials announced plans dispense COVID-19 booster shots Americans. Cancer, emergency surgery, accident, problems birth... potential problems abound.

May wise assume worst locale kind important elective coming up. something snagged first possible date off-chance becomes issue. I'm good area (for now) tends right thing, aside relatively people really mess things &amp; they're going far wide ""oops"", best assume. like energy grid telling don’t consider patient’s history prioritize transplant?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* course, pro-covid party. No. They're figuring 94% people UK antibodies 2-3 weeks, numbers similar. think whole thing around end year schools need close again. beginning, lot quarantines, they'll find quarantines lead - - additional cases they'll stop those, well. That's guess. Quarantines exposure end around Oct/Nov. Transparency golden key crisis communications. wondered they’d slowed making since supposedly making profit vs Moderna/Pfizer. there’s enough supply without maybe stepping back. us thinking anyways.  Lol yes. recall hearing budget cuts CDC earlier parts Trump admin (a years pandemic), staff morale plummeted lot top-performing team members left

Plus chaos past 18 months, I'd imagine staffing resource situation probably ideal. organizational capability might bit stunted Yeah know what’s regeneron? Yea like sort way prep body able fight covid hits us. Like fire alarm drill fire.. call magical panaceas v-a-c-c-i-n-e-s Except criminal enterprises (police unions) make sure aren’t subject mandates like unions make sure cops never held accountable law things like murder. Nice routine bit mundane wow sticking landing!   ethical decision basic triaging? adding another option triage. Last year went Halloween Horror nights Universal Howl-O-Scream Busch Gardens. keep masks we’re fully vaxed, dangerous go Delta went last September masks vacinated? appreciate detailed response know. Thank you. literal demon? tell anti-vax that, they'll come tik tok doctor skills boat you. boat don’t want on. BADLY wish could go pharmacy get mRNA booster. freaking hell out. mention many children ICU Dallas testing positive COVID-19.

Anyone know find number? Swine flu. Yeah, there's woolly array definitions 'long covid', impossible pin right now. Studies estimating 'long covid' prevalence 5% 70% - that's uselessly large range - methodological anarchy. Agree psychological impacts likely good bit 'fatigue/lethargy' portion it, also seem distinct physical components including post-ventilation trauma lung scarring severe cases, impact infection along olfactory nerves, potentially impacts blood clotting, long lasting defective immune responses. know else fun? dying getting debiliated due disease vaccines for!!! AMAZING CONCEPT!! \- hope government decide make vaccinations compulsory - said chairman Medical Council Prime Minister prof. Andrzej Horban. 
Prof. asked forecasts fourth wave coronavirus infections, Andrzej Horban replied predicted milder course spring wave. - Several, several thousand. Let remind 30,000 infections day, horrendous. think even 15,000. depends many factors. total relaxation - said prime minister's chief advisor combating pandemic. 
When asked introduction obligatory vaccinations Poland, prof. Horban replied, ""Our hand itches recommend mandatory vaccinations certain groups risk infection."" 
\- soon time comes, start compulsorily vaccinating - announced. added change attitude authorities expected. groups vaccinated. - hope government decide make vaccinations compulsory - said. 
\- divided people believe fact falling ill sufficient punishment, sometimes punishment fatal - added. 
\- long 200 infected day, focus convincing (for vaccinations) - said prof. Horban. - 1000 cases day, stop sounding alarm. clearly introducing restrictions - added. hope right. ER nurse northeast, seeing fair number covid patients returning Colorado. understand hippocratic oath cancer patient's cancer habits got going kill someone else. obese patients. renal failure patient. emotional physical toll families, I'm told generally survivable, choices kill others (besides consideration 2nd hand smoke, fuck guy smoked around family, anyway...)

&amp;#x200B;

COVID antivaxxers choices kill others, full stop. they're taking needed hospital beds first 3 patients likelier die. screw em. them. I'm glad care I'm sad get put belong back line. would say pedophiles, murders, rapists anyone else, say, waiting kidney transplant objectively better human beings also waiting treatment. we're it, even coming hospital? distrust medicine? deal conspiracy believing families, - enough RN doctor friends know worst patients entourages right now. Again, good job they're care real many us give single shit time up. Meanwhile hope get COVID combative anti-mask families.     think risk transmission significantly lower vaccinated people occurring whereas vaccines prevent that. referenced another comment vaccine immunology experts agreed herd immunity impossible point next strain likely much contagious among vaccinated people yeah don’t think they’re even trying aim herd immunity anymore thinks we’ll needing boosters forever. like flu shot every fall probably good idea. Maybe I’m planning worst pleasantly surprised? much hope early summer; life grand month. Then, Delta paid us visit… Desantis right though, early treatment save lives.. aka prophylactic/preventative measures... like saaaay vaccine maybe? JFC, this! ^ becomes endemic virus kills unvaccinated

Pretty much, I'm beginning wonder effect probate courts. could, one sense, change actuarial tables life insurance underwriters, might even provide unintended relief social security trust funds. Sucks finally reach age fully vested, never get draw much it.    Bloomberg research paper languished publishing limbo year half contains meticulously collected data photographic evidence supporting scientists’ initial hypothesis—that outbreak stemmed infected wild animals—which prevailed speculation SARS-CoV-2 escaped nearby lab gained report, published June online journal Scientific Reports, minks, civets, raccoon dogs, mammals known harbor coronaviruses sold plain sight years shops across city, including infamous Huanan wet market, many earliest Covid cases traced. The data report was collected 30 months by Xiao Xiao, a virologist whose roles straddled epidemiology animal research government-funded Key Laboratory Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conservation Hubei University Traditional Chinese Medicine.  

In words, 18-months later reasonable explanation origin COVID-19 even supporting evidence. like organ donations. here. understand things rough people, get it. people real health issues needed take precautions whole time. really end world. thots? makes say this? We've almost peaked delta. Rt dropping spread slowing dramatically. We're likely less two weeks peak (yes, local places peak later, imagine everywhere peak mid-September overall cases start dropping within next 10 days so, based lot data that's coming out). Lock downs coming back anywhere. CDC shutting admitting data making kind assertions part reason many people get vaccine say they're lied too. Like obviously complicated CDC wants inform people, jfc PR skills garbage. There's paywall.

Anyways, without article, patients sick would likely unvaccinated patients. Needed ever. example. CIA going remain active Afghanistan hopefully head another 9/11. One could argue covert CIA operations bigger bang buck overt military operations. Ironically enough regeneron effective treating mild moderate covid, severe patients still thoughts prayers rely Someone people like laying carpets okay. /s California Highway Patrol. Everyone vaxed wear mask doors take covid test week. medical staff isn’t, be, accountability. wholely likelihood survival. end hospital Covid likely die, even they’re vaccinated, even great medical care.

If hospital running resources it’s better use someone likely die anyway.

This *not* reprisal punishment unvaccinated, simply applying regular emergency triage.  Erm, parents go work bro. That's normal triage right? Focus better chance survival. hospital. public library thought based Israeli study? agree this. actually really refreshing see always feel crazy, even without masks, think increase cases would negligible completely non-existent. Community immunity much widespread we're giving credit for, think still expect peak cases 7-10 days, based lot modeling that's coming out. Careful there, know 100% folks get 5G VACCINE actually DIE? 





Usually ripe old age 100 natural causes surrounded loved ones great grandkids lived hopefully good full life, probably reminiscing possible cause got vaccines listened proper medical advice. people won’t get vaccine antibodies they’ll collapse waiting room get antibody treatment?! anyone even sympathy anymore? Hard least one guy wait week surgery shot six times. You’re missing point. vaccinated people get covid don’t severe symptoms. Fauci said specifically. whole point people sick they’re extremely symptomatic course high viral load regardless whether vaccinated. **That argument isn’t correct data showing vaccinated people test positive don’t symptoms mild symptoms.**  convenient.. please see amount holdings various governors company RNA* can’t catch fat die weeks like covid unvaccinated happy try spread you.

Selfishness price well.    Polio vaccinations distrusted CIA made worse. Peope who're afraid polio vaccine much different people who're afraid Covid vaccine. CARE SUFFERING ANYONE recall election... chad move would vaccine mandate get elected flip bird anti-vaxx crowd victory speech. seems writing wall herd immunity long time, journalism catching epidemiology. virus continue circulate, impact decline repeat exposure (or repeat vaccination) builds immune responses. Absolutely. One NYPD unions openly threatened DeBlasio doxxed daughter zero care consequence. city real power sides know it. Yea, maybe that's rest jackasses need to? Definitely question doctor, would suggest call tomorrow. said, I’ve read number horror stories r/nursing elsewhere unvaxxed pregnant mothers, exactly zero vaxxed pregnant mothers. pregnant, I’d getting vaxxed ASAP, even recovered earlier variant. Especially considering latest studies showing naturally-acquired immunity via prior infection good Delta variants, pregnancy known immune compromising increased risk severe disease. need restrictions economy dip anyway. preface saying right move.

But point, even matter? non-masked days already done work spread families, already overloaded hospitals. Genie already bottle, seeing bad gets. It’s possible time future may need consider idea possibly getting booster shots. Thanks. really scratching head knew this. original thread wife said he's relatively okay, he's immunocompromised way that's sought treatment. bad analysis. She’s assuming cases reach 7k day, looks like things already peaked (thankfully). literally care. number one objective preventing prevention? get it.  want someone live go eat indoors either. Vaccinated not. Especially older, assume mother is. every hospital, state, country vaccinate children. Relax. considering 90% population jab half workplace hasn’t. therefore workplace unusually high amount people vaccinated. wonder job attracts people?  ask doctor, reddit phd 28 days later .... *announces* 3rd shot needed Fuck yeah! Dudes awesome No. expectations really. novel virus implications emerging. going take long time parse repercussions everything. means biologically, emotionally, socially, economically, etc. many unknowns helpful change expectations necessarily good (positive) bad (negative) try wait see attitude. mitigate, weigh risk/benefit/cost ultimately there's much do. realizing this, knowing much control, way react things within control helpful. Science dynamic, constantly changing. going become endemic. need listen experts doctors telling us go there. ripples pandemic going effect lot things many years come. important calm lose perspective. going like probably 5-10 years, going get gradually better. I'm fully vaccinated, wear mask, social distance. son 13 fully vaccinated person school since last fall. husband ER physician come contact intubated CV19 patients every day going 2 years. He's never gotten sick this, completely asymptomatic. He's subjected weekly tests taken one test sick something else, negative. nurse PICU NICU. gotten sick work around positive patients community either. tough balance, everything minimize risk maintaining perspective still live lives without hermits catastrophizing every little thing. Media, social otherwise one worst things people real fear severe anxiety consume. live time media polarized, click-baity, maximized generate clicks/money. algorithms designed. Staying informed educated good, important step back unplug. Instead this, people talk personal physicians even consider therapist needed. going okay. going take time.  Yeah. course lot nurses, example, aren’t bedside. Educators, Admins, even Case Managers. retasked bedside, especially med/surg, can’t jump cold critical care environment. takes extensive orientation.  Pennsylvania entered chat  also think many subreddit split personality comes COVID now.

“Get vaccinated” “I don’t trust experts anymore”

“The science virus change, must go it” “fuck CDC said X three weeks ago saying Z”

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fire Congrats antivaxxers, comprising kids health education!  Nice add list possibilities linger back mind. though intercourse strange town name.  think lot ""absolutists"" aka conservatives trouble understanding this. said, dropping mask messaging right Delta making appearance pretty short sighted take scientific background see that.  lot us U.S. got J &amp; J point time vaccines scarce government investing lot public relations saying everyone get whatever vaccine available order increase speed rollout benefit whole country. probably right call point time.  
 lot J &amp; J recipients, like me, feel like government forgotten us. one jurisdiction know of, City County San Francisco, authorized J &amp; J recipients get another shot. Lol course do, 100% world soon enough. It’s like propaganda makes us forget viruses work. think learned biology, right? current bottleneck isn’t space, it’s staffing.

I figured case. people read ""hospital X running ICU units"" think space equipment issue, easy solve. reality time, staffing constrain, hard solve. Texas, Bishop Strickland unvaccinated persuading fellow priests get vaccine. anyway secret! It’s shame misleading people seek guidance. actually changed positions get Tetanus booster part new hire physical. Anyone arguing vaccine put fight Mantoux test. Need person classes well… Loss taste smell common among respiratory viruses REALLY common COVID19. test PCR rapid test. PCR would accurate test could take. also believe ingredient test poison going give cancer.    Remind them:

1. vaccine reduces number breakthroughs, thus making less likely spread disease.

2. vaccine helps people breakthroughs clear infection faster, contagious less time, thus making less likely spread disease. don’t think it’s entitlement much longer required situations… Ask doctor. would say get vaccinated, ask doctor knows ask advice get fever reactions. *confirm* first hand knowledge mention covid death certificate death counted covid death trackers? saw report wanted shake woman. thought sure going say yes, I’m getting vaccine soon can. nope - isolated talk reporter wall, still unsure. can’t people. Last heard, people due 8 months second shot. opens couple months someone 8 months past second vax, they’ll wait.

But things keep changing—so knows? What?  live Texas, afraid break leg , get car accident, get food poising, anything could land hospital. Btw vaccinated still… surprise No. There’s enough trained staff fully man actual hospitals. current bottleneck isn’t space, it’s staffing. would need National Guard FEMA deployment, I’d guess. argument place blame CDC public's inability reasonably handle informed. 

I, one, appreciate learning illnesses 2 primers plus booster work incredibly well. know article. I'm glad now. mean I'm going burn CDC ground turns COVID like that, made clear know. 

I'd rather informed possibilities rather intentionally left dark ""PR"". media cherry-picks statement, stand stance media, CDC, guilty. fact developing world remain indefinitely unvaccinated ensure never leave COVID conundrum, always new variant deal with.

But reality modern politics. guess big cities extra people sacrificed yes short term benefit person school year versus long term consequences tens hundreds thousands kids getting long covid, idea long lasts really understand people think masks work. like bother cover mouth sneeze. friend runny nose congestion, etc couple days ago went get tested. tested negative. Today told lost sense taste smell. suggested get tested likely COVID point? dont think issue risk much risk school year/semester. unless we're going month smth (frustrating everyone) need pick plan stick it. person schooling dangerous 90%+ people school vaccinated, includes children. can't rely current case rate politicians country shown give shit let another wave happen 2 months Cleetus McFarland Cooper Bogetti. large group people around knows many others infected. [Epithelial Well won’t find CDC infinite wisdom decided track HOSPITALIZED breakthrough infections sounds like vaccine side effect. know someone got Covid days getting vaxxed last December. idiots heard vaccine?
Let losers lay get medical science reject. Seriously! I’m much looking forward getting 3 year old vaccinated. won’t take anywhere indoors without mask mandate, recently, one around required masks. We’re still mostly sticking outdoor activities. I’m looking forward going back library story time, signing dance gymnastics. 

I still think I’ll refrain licking doorknobs though, lol. 

Hang there! Poland, best! refuse that? type get vaccinated? LFG Oregon tight  No, none masked primary school. must new here.... Welcome

Read FAQ sub find support crazy stuff called science. yes take precautions that’s exact point. compromised don’t feel need so, neither friends family affected decision. like said, wear mask get vaxxed you’re worried, i’m knockin means. yall know nothing people’s situations i’d chill yelling anyone anything. you’re concerned, would suggest attending concert 40k people. went tested negative twice far PCR home tests. perspectives yours. Hold Florida man. Even do, enough trained staff available man field hospitals? thats american way, ignore problem means might get re-elected download it.  friend ask go Aquatica(water park near SeaWorld Orlando) group friends Sunday. feel like I'm going end opting stay home. That's [an example Simpson's older people likely vaccinated, also likely get seriously sick.

Once compare vaccinated unvaccinated people age range, vaccine 91% effective severe disease Delta people 50 years old, 85% effective people age 50. I'm immunocompromised got hospital want take precautions I'm gonna fucking take precautions.

Particularly around moron antivaxxers. Although dropping like flies area that. Omg Twitter profile pic  It’s posted account whose information “Medical whistleblower. anti-vaxx, pro-truth. Pseudonym. MD. PhD.” I’m going outright propaganda herd immunity waning antibodies. American College Obstetricians Gynecologists (ACOG) Society Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), two leading organizations representing specialists obstetric care, recommend pregnant individuals vaccinated Anyone want speculate about:

* whether mRNA vaccine induced spike proteins, built cells, act same, might able cranked open make discoverable smaller, shorter lived doses... whether that's big risk case recently vaccinated individual got infected live virus
* long permanently closed viral particle likely circulate removed body people ignoring actual long term effects Covid proclaiming “it’s flu!”
make crazy. talking New Orleans African Americans make 60% population. Reading comprehension important   strain. delta strain virulent. want, science says get vaccinated, that’s wanted people do. people act dumb, that’s fault. 

Nice chatting. good one. happening Canada since last year, returned class learning. Moderna vaccine April last week got Covid. It’s really rough. I’m jealous vaccine actually works for. roommate who’s around entire time tested negative. Tbh exactly *should* appointed. don’t need best scientist helm CDC…we need someone scientific background actually knows handle public messaging.

The CDC absolute disaster since start pandemic, continues streak incompetence new administration. honesty, US gone week lockdown Delta cases first started reported. way US politicians would call that. can't serious. someone enlists army 18, can't decide sleep older person...

We'll keep people bubbles hit 25 years old. Effects testosterone general physical activity? Transient myocarditis occurs younger men athletes, seen infections. concept herd immunity 70% something came early studies projections. made sense variants. aiming something slightly different now. Herd protection instead immunity. still get infected infect others vaccinated, vaccines protected severe forms disease. Vaccines make us immortals, protected. Unless kids put private schools, seem restrictions, homeschooling still might overwhelming families. sounds like even get third shot still want everyone around wear masks forever. fine, view, don’t expect real world actually work way.  mostly think supply solveable problem. It’s booster third world. both.

From everything I've read, seen anything indicates manufacturing plants staffing could scaled time soon?

If proposing new, previously-unplanned manufacturing capacity used boosters, instead using manufacturing capacity would otherwise used first doses, etc., would support that.

Nature said may take 2 years summer finish vaccinations - boosters use manufacturing capacity would otherwise used first/second doses, guess could even longer? Well, made bad decision (and many times) confidence decision make future good 🤷🏼‍♂️ Isn’t something thats generally supposed done prior releasing public? supposed blindly take hope issues arise? 

Also shot uses Dead virus particles like flu shot force body immune response much different shot makes bodies RNA replicate copies spike protein create immune response, never used humans prior; don’t ya think? also take precautions- may know, masks really protect others wearer others. They've vaccinated, bodies mount strong defense drugs take. I'm hoping get third shot soon. I've heard conflicting reports mortality rates specific situations, 60 extra weight. Even social distancing indoor capacity limits might need brought back, can’t safe. No, think made bad decision.

I think people getting vaccinated high enough numbers one problem.

I also think waning immunity vaccines another (but smaller) problem.

And think ignorance people refuse wear masks yet another. 

We’ll kill ourselves. don’t need agency around instruct us, humans appear pretty darn stupid anyway. Can’t blame cdc that. Texas spreading COVID fast, would think stable electrical system ventilators. Don’t forget, vaccines monoclonal antibodies EUA. “experimental”.

But one gets talked political prophets, one gets talked up. That’s is. there’s peak, it’s Florida, they’re ~53% vaxxed.

Alabama ~35% vaxxed. consensus breakthrough case. 

This study seems include anyone vaccinated tests positive breakthrough case CDC counts hospitalized died. Well that's I'm currently going hopefully that's case. feel totally fine definitely feel like ANOTHER 10 day quarantine one over. would interesting see those. needs “photos covid” subreddit going beginning now. wish saved pics links start   vaccines developed delta/delta+ variants currently? [Sorry raining circlejerk  don’t use absolute terms, kind article extremely misleading.

We data clinical trials. isn’t going super widespread problem suddenly discovered. 

They’re talking extremely rare side effect slightly less extremely rare. get first vaccine Walgreens 1 state get 2nd dose Walgreens 21 days later another state? Walgreens city? mom works assisted living place, absolutely fucking nuts. said she’d rather give security job loves work doordash instead. Mind you, lives condo pays everything herself. doordasher saw didn’t make much. thinks she’ll locked camp isn’t vaccinated, vaccinated people danger HER. I’m fucking exhausted. feel bad saying I’d love watch employers force needle arm point.

But don’t know exact thing nursing home. bet it’s not. might want research opinion…oh, wait, username spot you’re aware. misleading though. UK Israel incredibly high vaccination rates, way fewer unvaccinated people hospitalized.

For countries high vaccination rates, need look overall rate hospitalization compared vaccines. Considering Delta variant radically different virus one existed last year, possible compare. July 24th seems kind long time ago using source that. 

Using CDC data divide AY3 amount AY3+B.1.617.2, get following data weeks ending date:

5-Jun	15.67% 
12-Jun	15.29% 
19-Jun	13.73% 
26-Jun	13.98% 
3-Jul	12.61% 
10-Jul	14.41% 
17-Jul	13.13% 
24-Jul	13.23% 
31-Jul	12.55% 


Seems like tendency towards declining. use lower bounds variants, there's maybe slight increase AY3 time relative OG Delta, use upper bounds there's clear downward trend. 

Maybe AY3.1 different? point though is, think CDC guidance couple months ago reason delta got bad? so, CDC consider possibility releasing guidance? CDC knew delta time still told us remove masks without confirming true risk delta  PLEASE get vaccinated.

You doctors’ care point need monoclonal antibodies. Republicanism sociopathic ideology enjoys killing people. Many countries willing buy/pay vaccines enough supply.

It appear boosters coming previously-unknown vaccine manufacturing capacity. Instead, going come facilities previously planned/would otherwise used get first doses, etc. non-rich countries? kids find classmate dropping bugs head every time scratch though. Last year NY informed us. year refuse to. Unless test within last 5 minutes, it’s worthless. Ah, would make sense. male though? parents say. said *at time*.

Evidence Delta running wild suggests *now* — surges happening — it’s better everyone wear masks. 

We learn covid time things change. Also environment changes lot people area sick. Like right I’d rather NY Florida. would made reverse argument March 2020. Dude, article January. post article pre-vaxx era insist *what goal whole time* another “layer Swiss cheese” (as problems solutions mentioned somehow equal other) makes think don’t much faith science public cooperate want. weird considering well latter worked year half… Even mind, getting vaccine difference minor cold tube pharynx Tom Hanks never got that, deniers would've latched someone else scapegoat vilify. fully realize reason, logic, critical thinking involved, better understand them.  wrong eye love still thinks vaccine availability thing drive variants. 

What think drive variants vaccine Boosters never issue supply going unused thrown away.

I checked, ""In many states, data shows wasted unusable doses 2 percent received federal government successfully administered."" (From month.)

So forms waste/unusable dosages tiny, tiny percent. boosters presumably *many times* doses wasted/unusable doses combined, rolling large scale booster programs, doses thrown away likely increase well? response school NY. also provide remote learning kids health issues can't attend person safely. like last year year flipped places. Somehow got things right last year year made bunch shit ignored reality. Please stop talking.  robust immune inflammatory response perhaps? US much higher percentage (especially higher risk groups) unvaccinated. concede numbers US cumulative 2021, stupid way measure.   alright kraft punk, got thank submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It’s like people concerned obesity, wanting top notch care heart attack. mean Ken Griffith, owner Citadel science back simply vaccinated people safe without masks.

You never predict people do. best science based recommendation (and still is) get vaccinated. 

I think made bad decision. don’t think inherently political. Misguided, sure. Aussies care comment sentiment within country? can’t imagine people put much longer  Vote out. get another chance while.  basically understood people liked aligned it. 

As result liked better it. Yep too. (we) even want help poor, nevertheless poor. world sucks right now. Especially us. going say … CDC stop saying things challenge let’s go. (respectfully) agree :D

The 30% country problem *is* larger social issue. Also, people created vacuum. drove positions?

I could go length terms opinion, I'll try brief. 

It's worth noting probably vast majority remaining 30% also identify ""conservative"" (GOP). believe coincidence. GOP undergoing demographic crunch, neoliberalism decimating rural infrastructure, jobs, services (e.g. rural hospitals closing, grocery stores except dollar generals, etc); GOP stay relevant must radicalize, since GOP party paying lip service rural areas *the GOPs base also radicalized.* 

Part radicalization dismissal science, established norms wrt politics, dismissing anyone challenges party dogma even sensible rebuttal, shouting ""FREEDOM!"" whenever restriction public good suggested, etc, etc. combine radical attitude already exploitative system (that people intuitively sense level), system plays fast loose human life, etc get people *identify* anti-mask, anti-vax, both, etc.

To close this, every system suffers *diminishing marginal returns material/social complexity.* fuck people long enough eventually want trust even actually trying help them, even need cooperation, etc. should’ve common practice beginning country like India, it’s really hard keep track numbers. There’s also thousands people dying COVID never formally diagnosed disease. Given ground reporting, expected massive undercount.  See (also published NYT that's behind paywall). 

The problem people get vaxxed think anything else. problem also people get vaxxed. 

Vaxx + mask + distance + STFH. Here’s table [from Laurie showing % variant states. Definitely seeing uptick AY3 US south.     now? Credibility top priority CDC …… apparently. Hmmm... speculations prevalent males 30? I’ve never Disney, u admit, I’d maybe considered going first opened back up, seemed far less crowded time. 

But again, didn’t see huge amount footage opening back lockdown real though. couldn’t wait protected see ape Right? thoughts well. I'm sure comments freaking about. Wow must kids Honesty best That’s many breakthrough cases Congress. When/Where catch that? missed it. One local article, District hundred teachers quit , top 27 openings already they're scrambling big time nothing mess getting worse. prove *is* issue third shot.

How many flu shots gotten life? US giving 3rd doses donating excess. scary stuff when, numbers go up, another virus kicks in. Started? anybody really think Danny Boy’s grandchildren going public school? Nay friends, go private school masks required. Texas felon chock full shit. Hell even within single county it’s hodge podge. 

In area neighboring districts run gamut full mitigation measures like masking, distancing, eating classrooms, etc. districts literally nothing reporting cases isolating close contacts it’s required law. science long time. countries banned total crapshoot. mention pointless since Americans travel countries come back. know, totally ridiculous. Wtf pandemic application laws, codes legislation?

Also, magnets? Great example divisive, politically motivated rhetoric filled twisted facts blame. ideological media outlets destroying country world.

I'm sure Democrat politician DC came agreed Patrick topic would skewered much. We'd thing even much high vaccine coverage. elimination strategy maintained least vaccinate kids, happen months. Even we'd totally completed adult rollout we'd 65-70% population coverage that's nowhere close herd immunity Delta. we'd locking regardless. Look China, high vaccine coverage still immediately went lockdowns Delta appeared. 

I'm also worried containing it. lockdowns tight. Basically everything closed right aside supermarkets pharmacies. even allow takeaways, short list essential workers. outbreak burn way lot households spread much beyond that. Numbers drop sharply couple weeks. I'd like finish reading article there's pic someone needle arm.

Urg.

I confess, avoid shots much possible. painful child still painful. injected fluid burns addition piercing pain. went 12 years without tetanus shot never gotten flu shot. *(I contact immunocompromised)*

For everyone saying hurt, I'm glad you! Everyone experiences pain differently similar taste: different densities nerves pain receptors mean people feel sensation and/or perceives sensation painfully.

Breaking skin either pierce slice makes squirm. can't watch it, can't see it, even image. *hate* stock footage injections splashed publications days. thinking shot makes knees weak. remember crying tot every trip clinic; matter went.

I went got J&amp;J soon eligible available. Yeah, hurt, pinch injection. wait booster ends advised transmissions still problem local me, go get despite idea shots makes feel, know hurt degree, 3 days flat side effects.

I get trembly-nervous blood draw weak kneed actually prefer draw injection. I'll still booster COVID.

Like.... Let's keep pretending everyone else's fault guess? likely vaccinated? Ridiculous, administration joke, Canada 80% vaccination rate 10 times less cases per capita. science anymore.  kid case well. I'm sure changed big thing work 2018 breakout sent kid home got told incorrect state rep. He's also re-election 2022, % last time. could toppled. shows Michigan 54.3% vaccinated; googled it, World Data showed Michigan 49.7% vaccinated.

There's still difference Detroit, quite large comment indicated. Though perhaps percentage looking subset age groups whereas saw looking entire population? wearing masks gets way beating peaceful protestors. supposed mow crowd police SUVs faces constricted? /s detached reality. I’m RT Minnesota. Burnout becoming difficult combat. Whatever….  Exactly. working class ones allowed vote. landlords, politicians, business owners, none garbage. Might well said “I racist everybody!” Mandatory work office, needs over.  ...he's literally saying bad stuff load. I'm shocked, disappointed. tired all. Guy works mom die COVID. Still spouts COVID fake pandemic vaccines unsafe. person oblivious? Nothing wrong Democracy way ancient Greeks practiced it. Universal Suffrage undoing. half voters average intelligence guarantees race bottom Don’t bring anyone’s mother cheered day. Even year, would say. Also, interesting statistical paradox.

So booster really able consider like flu, last, isn´t it? bodies!?  Unlikely general population. vulnerable groups quite likely.  That's official timetable going be. Israel, probably people, think 40% symptomatic 75-90% hospitalization count ""good"" ""robust"" protection that's sufficient, CDC thinks does, wants numbers drop even first. 

If guess why, think they're trying make ethical compromise, delaying often people US get vaccinated get vaccines poor countries. disagree low they're willing let numbers drop family following recommendations Israel, boosters 40+ now. also obvious need everyone 6months. 

With many doses we're throwing out, I'm worried ethics line jumping. recently went Europe amazing much better handling pandemic US. stricter rules including ""health pass"" everyone actually seems comply rules. I'm sure people mad international travel open, honestly felt much safer traveling abroad US. actually felt like could trust person sitting next restraunt right things whereas US certain percentage population openly flaunts indifference suffering others. Driving rural Pennsylvania way Canada recently people looked like two heads went around wearing mask. Saying racist bit loud… least they’re trying pretend anymore Look bring facts feelings fight. must pretty mediocre governance need people ""rat out"" municipalities find going on. Isn’t hospitalizations death lagging stat? Shouldn’t come decline infections? recording fyp white folk anybody else don’t know what’s vax shit like this. Make make sense. admit is, first time seen AY.3 mentioned becoming prevalent Delta even admitted could cluster testing time we'd see. Thanks updated data though! know get common cold again? Similar principle work here. I’m losing track. Lambda supposed spread less easily, isn’t it? serious Delta contract it? affect vaccinated people way Delta does? also get antibodies one dose catching covid. One guy team (26 think) bit anti vaxer pro-covid, stereotypical American type, 'natural better' type. think type anti vaxer have, tell get vaccinated protest, hard convince take it. 

He's arguing fair Europe non-vaccinated allowed go gym, supermarket, clubs etc. pretty obvious he's vaccinated. whole team vaccinated him, even Trump supporting American boss vaccinated. Especially since elderly still risk, something like 95%+ vaccinated UK. Easter. guess right, EU tourism US larger Europeans leave much money US way around (as Europeans stay 3-4 weeks Americans generally days). 

For EU general, sure. EU states much reliant tourism others. country like Germany probably care much whether US tourists coming not, countries around Mediterranean much affected reduced Still point think reciprocity language US administration would understand. Block border Americans, rethink policy.

I hope EU consider summer holidays coming end. current US policy absurd. world enter US fine, despite often worse outbreaks EU countries, yet people EU countries, closest allies US indiscriminately banned. USA sadly self sufficient single European country... doesnt need tourism.

I think key thing USA ain't willing deal making enforcing rules enter. opening select countries, play numbers game. Opening UK alone would prob bring travellers existing open countries combined. would say this? Idiots “It personal choice get tested,” Sanders said. “I don’t believe taking away personal freedom choice enforcing testing.”

Testing 100x less invasive vaxxing, wtf. TX world hurt. hit right head. federal government trying wipe hands Covid soon push responsibility states. Healthcare US style. Almost 90%? doubt much. Maybe king, pierce snohomish counties, way would hit 90% Mississippi west,eastern Washington, included. mean heretic. toss suitcase full em front window. least thats around here. Imagine dying covid 2021. Pathetic. Everyone mask get vax

This 100% right playbook corporate America. everybody else cares anybody themself.  yeah, here.  know getting downvoted. 

Like shit, booster boosts, would really happier boost every 6 months. that, high-risk categories disproportionately vaccinated % vs general population. serves cases drastically skew hospitalization/mortality cases towards vaccinated population.  breakthrough cases rare anymore, vaccinated too, maybe test easier use (like one Olympics).   AY.3? concern waning immunity. plan re-vaxx every 8 months, out?

If that's worst face, boy dodged bullet. last sentence makes hell song lyric Vaccination effectiveness reports: data vaccination status: Effectively, high cases, low deaths. vaccine never meant cure anything. significantly reduce need hospitalisation. Basically making Covid like bad flu rather something worse. 

If want evidence vaccines vs deaths illness countries - Check Iceland. scenario. High cases, almost 0 deaths last 6 months so.  don’t want get vaccinated they’ll inject peoples antibodies, guess tracks.  That’s assuming relatively consistent rates vaccination across population today (from basis data drawn). NOT; people high risk categories disproportionately vaccinated compared general population, serves skew hospitalization/mortality rates vaccinated. Given vast majority deaths well known occur vulnerable populations, could easily distributing, already today, vaccines effective reducing mortality across population. Australian, agree determination avoid deaths cost. I’m grateful haven’t lost anyone close me. lockdown miserable plenty people really tough severe loss income. current situation can’t hold don’t know happens next. many kid ICUs near-full/full moment southern US. may reason. writing condescending manner way.  correct.

Well...I mean, US, article UK, comment we're discussing coronavirus, specific country. said incorrect: likelihood mutations causing global issues quite high, we're middle situation right now. original question still answered: consider delta variant ""excape"" variant, setting boundaries? 

Congrats high rate vaccination, btw. one thing appears holding steady, regardless vaccine, variant, country infected, radically decrease death rate. graphs quite striking.

I think 10% ICU mostly sinovac government offers 3rd dose Pfizer ones took 2 sinovac shot first. think probably considered data well. even 4th dose available. Dumb people. People pay attention news/think covid hoax/they immune it. think pandemic something political.  Ah right see, US. guys really facing quite different challenges us UK, discussion about. 

We've vaccinated 90% adult population, used combo AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, booster program starting vulnerable September. intents purposes though, people feel confident moving forwards lives think. think intentions well meant, hopefully turn endless lockdown. NZ government able stock outbreak, it’s gonna take while. look parts Australia now. Texass need Governor get ! 😉 guess right, EU tourism US larger Europeans leave much money US way around (as Europeans stay 3-4 weeks Americans generally days).

Please note capacity prevent severe illness likewise lowered. 

And ""remaining unvaccinated"" every country involves children can't get vaccinated...depending makeup area, 10-20% population. 

Lastly, answer first question, US discussing necessity booster shots every six months year. Full vaccination. least one dose closer 80%. takes one like class 25 put everyone quarantine.  Started Monday fed office Dreading done nothing prepare avoid. That’s even worse something blue. They’ve since January 2020 get together masks, distancing measures, and, since December 2020 get vaccines. amen need herd immunity, need get hospitalizations low enough maintain hospital capacity.

People read history give context communities bit providing context.

To close Dan Patrick huge piece shit. unpopular. CDC estimates 1.1 million ""newly vaccinated"" booster shots.

it's cdc guideline unvaccinated person (which 11 year old surely I'm confused herd immunity means point. UK something like 95% 18+ population antibodies.

human scientific achievement isn’t enough solve problem global warming. don’t think it’s reasonable pretend humans suddenly going change behavior, that’s suggesting. aren’t position try survive. use science solve issue. Right now, doesn’t seem like human scientific achievement coming solutions. 
Not sure felt need vote rather respectful debate. Take upvote well.  forgetting long COVID. going vaccinated least order magnitude less likely require hospitalisation, even orders less dying. catching COVID becomes acceptable risk. matter anyone did, corona always getting NZ Aus eventually. Asymtomatic spreading virtually impossible. coughing. sneezing. bodily fluid spreading things.

The reasons viruses make symptomatic first place there's evolutionary advantage so.

A coughing/sneezing infected person spread virus. asymptomatic person won't.

If disagree, please cite evidence. Unless I'm mistaken Alabama one first school systems start classes, believe August 2? also one highest ICU beds per capita Nation... beds, bode well rest country...I predict Florida go back top couple weeks...they started school.... States reporting 20% hospitalizations breakthrough cases. numbers 98% hospitalizations unvaccinated metric based total infected since January 2021. course smaller percentage. 

The numbers looking breakthrough cases last 2 weeks month.

To clear vaccinated think everyone get vaccinated narrative needs change now. Giving people misleading information contributing variant spreading jeopardizing people's lives.

The vaccines effective initial covid strain delta variant anymore.. vaccines less effective overall resistance people deserve know that. 

Not mention anyone contracts another chance virus mutate. Delta baseline meaning new variants transmissable potentially so. Thread starts fresh every day. people allowed take antibody tests prove effective immunity - regardless whether comes vaccine surviving Covid?

And, could come ""just live route"" if/when vast majority global population vaccinated. happens, continued high case rates paths mutations pose greater greater risks everybody whether vaccinated not.

Covid keep mutating mutation less lethal before. figure 2025 figure become annoying endemic disease like flu. keep fighting else healthcare system collapse. called triage, happening right now.

Last checked hospital system simply COVID ward refuse get vaccinated. return Jedi ending celebration anytime soon?  Well idea antibodies body attacks virus soon body, it’d nice prevent outbreak body exactly? Like yes could done better covid problem literally every country world right now. additional information soon, nobody who's immunocompromised supposed getting boosters September 20th anyway. think LA Times looking arc pandemic eyes California residents. fact 2 Americas: one vast majority still masking taking precautions worrying whether attend family functions &amp; large concerts/events; another South/Midwest itching ditch masks, put blinders &amp; get back fun (no matter falling ill dying). anxious feel really depends part America live in.

I mean, know transparently hit piece, western countries taking massive gamble long covid. even China. potentially really sabotaging ourselves. US likely far behind time fall hits.

We're like 75% adults vaccinated. We've got natural immunity days. we're getting first shots 400k people (not adults obviously) day.

As rough winter? I'd surprised vaccinating kids then. Seems like anywhere virus go winter. theyre DIRTY DIRTY PEOPLE! :) one person likely higher risk dying kids teaching. another situation change dress code enforce masks, still compliance state order they'll reference it? feel point someone gets covid goes hospital, ask they're vaccinated. vaccinated, come treatment. vaccinated, ask would get vaccinated; answer send home.

An excerpt copypasta:

 “Phase 3 results evaluating third dose expected shortly submitted FDA, EMA regulatory authorities worldwide. U.S., Pfizer BioNTech plan seek licensure third dose via supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) individuals 16 years age older, pending FDA approval primary BLA submitted May 2021.

Like need read post bunch links like they’re type definitive evidence safety directing someone take this. 
Even words state authorized except immunocompromised yet beyond emergency use. Yet using links like they’re guaranteed proof safety. called previously.  Nice Beats ventilators, sickness death. Well, one thing, people seem understand covid, unlike common cold, much cardiovascular disease respiratory disease. causes lot problems us long term communicable diseases used to.

Also, people tired want want information conflicts pandemic over. get it. I'm willing stake long term health ""want"" believe. I'd rather information make informed decision. Oh ok guess trust anymore thanks insane. city (NYC) come house, give vaccine want, pay $100 service. people want?! read article Douglas Co. patient dying ICU beds. awful. I'm getting 3 shot every 2 weeks allergies right think I'll live adding 1 every 6 months Hospitals put statement saying triage unvaccinated covid patients last, less chance survival Ok thanks They're macho talk radio listeners. ""Deeply frustrating"". kind. guessing surge beginning. know I’d consider 70 odd cases large impact. Source? little prevent spread delta variant.

People keep saying true.

Vaccinated people still less likely infected all.

And vaccinated people get infected contagious long.

The vaccines really lot slow spread. 


The nice thing is, take word it! sources:

Finally, Leana Wen, great job describing [Washington Post fact vaccinated sometimes spread disease mostly relevant people live elderly, children, immunocompromised. Vaccinated people main drivers spread. Prob  say becoming useless 6 months, seems like efficient delta variant variants. Also testing milder cases too, understand Pfizer's phase 3 focused severe symptoms time studies testing people every minor system either.

It still good job keeping people away hospital. honest, never bought idea vaccines preventing virus completely vaccinated person spread disease either. never tested goal. actually liked wearing mask cold weather 🥶 I'm assuming boosters talking mrna based shots, often get sent ""developing nations"" since can't store them.

So tell pfizer mordenra stop start making J&amp;J vaccine instead? Nothing link says illegal send home notices. provided NYS link another comment seemingly ignoring downvote it. key amino-acid change might underlie coronavirus variant’s ferocious infectivity

I'm still reading understood text title together Delta may less infectious on, right? run room every aspect possible people left stay home. exhausted staff space likely lock doors sense. collapse would workers walked out. Last years Sturgis 70 cases related it. report example bad healthcare system, show willfully ignorant people country  image exist people gotten vaccinated.  like option vaccine mRNA vaccine. could opted traditional type vaccines available instead. I'll see news try hand around October would 6 months  would even possible?  video scared shit me. exactly point -- people vaccinated think dying getting hospitalized crowning achievement.

long term brain fog, fatigue, neuropathy, myocarditis.. things really suck happen EVEN vaccinated stupidity concerted effort tracks back almost local state elections special interest huge donors huge stake keeping people divided downtrodden. Things never change. According CDC less 350,000 Americans get chicken pox year thanks vaccine.  Last night Rachel Maddow Dr. David Kimberlin Alabama saying he’s afraid hospital system Alabama may collapse. shutdown, economic activity slow restaurants can't enough income pay rent close since relief time around.

If hospitals get point people dying waiting (we far that), people scared. Scared people go eat out, go movie theathers, bars small venues. go malls either. vaccine prevent long covid   Hm, yeah, that's weird. stick 1:1 ratio indica/cbd, low-level stuff. Weed bred intense take little get high surpass feels good feels control. know several folks get bad anxiety sativa, much indica/cbd. 

I've also heard good things Delta 8/9, described weed lite, tried personally. beat it. They're wrong. letters still sent. FDA inaction approving use 2-11 age group criminal. city seen 4th death child 10 since March Covid. 

These mystery drugs, they've already put hundreds millions people. going convince physiological difference 12 year olds 2 years olds extreme vaccines would kill them.   hope kids remember party trying get killed. well mayhap time everyone call sick  described basically 21st century India.

Not many old, lots young people carry lots diseases.

US 330 million - 720k excess deaths

India 1.4 billion - 4-5 million excess deaths (probably)

The US spends per capita healthcare anywhere else world, example start covid US 44 ventilators per 100k population UK 4 ventilators per 100k. US 10x number ICU beds China does.

All money US pays healthcare actual get spent expensive toys save life emergency. That's awful. can't even imagine terribly angry sad would make shoes. still wrong. NYS form letter available schools. me, madness events happening places even open time like this.

Disney State Fairs never ""necessary"" ""essential"".  sure - I'll take booster day comes out. also advocate people knowing (minute) risks involved data-driven approach.

There key factors making decision like this.

There course always privacy risks involved weighted necessity, effectiveness, proportionality.

**Necessity:** must evidence-based must less privacy-intrusive measures available equally effective achieving specified purposes.

**Effectiveness:** must likely effective achieving defined purposes

**Proportionality:** privacy risks associated must proportionate public health purposes intended address. Data minimization needs applied least amount personal health information collected, used disclosed.

For example, Ontario Occupational Health Safety Act, employers duty protect workers health safety risks. exists similar duty federally regulated employers subject Canada Labour Code. Accordingly, certain circumstances, argument could eventually made that, face evidence demonstrating COVID-19 vaccination effective measure reducing risk transmitting (as opposed contracting) virus, employers within rights mandate immunization order protect employees workplace. erectile dysfunction part every billboard, every commercial break, Facebook ads.

Hope mild case. keep coming back Reddit. Y’all got chuckling. need start infecting anti-vaxxers Covid super strong superior immune systems beat back 'flu' get antibodies like real strong people do.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m parent don’t want disrespectful don’t you? illegal logistically difficult stay home? I’m really genuinely curious. sympathies. aggressively unvaccinated: death opportunities lives. world better without you. According Bloomberg Oregon given enough vaccines fully vaccinate 60% population. That’s really good far US states concerned still leaves 40% unvaccinated also takes days vaccines really kick in. Obviously unvaccinated already covid recovered 40% still significant unvaccinated population provides plenty room variant spread especially 40% aren’t taking precautions. can't wait hear big babies cry mandated employers. windfall r/byebyejob Unfortunately also applies vaccinated.  Oh lol, sorry thinking September 2021! Oh jesus. That's parody sub... can't imagine long. They'd probably need subdivide point next highest risk factors, would probably start immunocompromised. White House COVID-19 Response Team still giving regular press briefings. People stopped paying attention. Ehhh. I’m fully vaccinated, get tested couple days ago typical mild breakthrough symptoms. I’m concerned myself, I’m contagious, need know even careful around friends vulnerable, know?  still one rich country Europe vaccinate chickenpox  Oh, I'm sure applicable majority small towns throughout Oregon.  real. Safety trials over, get there! mention, many hundreds thousands likely millions Americans going long haul symptoms haunt god knows long....probably vaccinated folks bunch too. want covid, wear go\* dam\* good mask numbers come way down! viruses work

It isn't? mutations viruses happen replication process? mutation potential transmissable, lethal and/or resistant vaccines? people mutations (hundreds millions per host) increase chances?

What relief. Thank you! made loud angry noises hit paywall. 😅 hope appellate court judges science denying morons. We'll see. least moron top gets blocked weeks. Sometimes, comes anti-vaxxers, finger wants tap caps key never let non-capital letter exist. ""Infuriating"" far weak word. Let workplace mandates begin! Important note: Wisconsin, CDC.

""A press release Wisconsin Department Health Services confirms intend get third shot permitted choice long 28 days since initial two-dose vaccine series completed.

An advisory committee Centers Disease Control Prevention recommends receiving vaccine type originally given first two appointments -- suggestion echoed Audrey Boerner, public information officer Eau Claire City-County Health Department."" Fair point. sick vaccinated still asked much accommodate unvaccinated. Sure, you’re immunocompromised you’re due booster get ugly breakthrough? isn’t something happy about. gross symptom rotten exploitative system. Exactly. quote April 2020:

*The latest figures show 264 U.S. hospitals 6,000 country ability perform ECMO. geographic distribution, 58.5 percent adult population United States access ECMO-capable center. number jumps 90 percent effective interhospital transfer available, ideal circumstances.*

Only small portion ones listed knowledge capacity small children.

It's certainly remarkable treatment provide chance survival cases otherwise none. However, far certain. I've reading several comments lately social media people sure loved ones would survived covid received ECMO. may well true cases, fatality rate covid patients received ECMO still close 50% based ELSO registry.

In words: One definitely try get ECMO considered useful hospital, really want situation means extremely serious risk death high. Posted earlier. hospital now. Can’t breathe. There’s lot protocol involved get tested get admitted. Waiting truck come me. 

Don’t make goddamned mistake made. symptoms go hospital immediately. I’m trying inconvenience staff godsamn feel like I’m gonna pass ^^^^ vaccine you? well then, icu bed you! - simple SSRI withdrawal now, decades late, acknowledged medical community. Hopefully days treating psychiatric drug withdrawal symptoms mental illness recurrent symptoms existing mental illness, treated psychiatric drugs, soon behind us.  read persons comments, said narrative Israel highly vaccinated done away with.

And even then, vaccine still effective small proportion total vaccinated individuals hospitalized. travel now. then. Asymptomatic case Aug 2020, last shot April 2021. Unvaxxed eat salad every exercise times week 💪  Mild cold. Humans get colds. Take look around stadiums filled tens thousands people look death hospitalization stats. Vaxxed getting tested anymore. cold aka covid, arent logged. Millions them. Bc cases mild. Literally likely die lightening strike. go paranoid live perpetual sensationalization viral cold youve vaccinated against. dont know else tell u. See comment above. give livers *practicing* alcoholics. post could written me. Apart isolation ends Saturday picked son think got swimming lessons. 

My advice would testing. lateral flow tests seem pick virus first experience main three symptoms (cough, fever loss smell. testing negative three days later LFTs. son still tested positive PCR test day 10. 

If feeling sort change body. Even slightest difference get PCR. 

Lots people UK still cautious far returning previous lifestyles believe helping keep numbers down. 

Like others stated real test kids go back school temperature drops.  Highest median citizen age? I’m double vaccinated, second vaccine 2 months ago. Went work last weekend - first outing 18 months - got covid. It’s absolutely kicking arse. day 4 symptoms hoping dies soon. I’d advise arguing Reddit. People get emotional stuff site lack eq understand medical ethics aspect it. 

This regularly advocates extrajudicial lynching people hurt animals (and make mistake 0 sympathy abusers). Hell, half time want justice system treat like regular murder. 

It’s hard get across people true ethics morality this. 

Medically, ethically, can’t deprioritize someone’s treatment chose get vaccinated. understand emotionally us want get second rate treatment next someone vaccinated can’t get vaccine. Fuck, even think that’s ‘just deserts’. ethics standpoint, that’s giant hard no. Even explaining people it’s go met people going “bUt cHoSe sO” (or “how come it’s okay endanger others!!!” true, it’s shifting discussion away doctors duty). People don’t think ramifications beyond immediate future example. also hate invoke slippery slope argument, ethically it’s tight rope walk. Plus people sometimes make bad choices. Making mistake shitty opinion isn’t grounds doctor sign death warrant. 

It sucks, doctors often wrestle dislike too. thankfully understand ethics oath. Fuck unvaccinated, ethically still duty treat anyone else. Medical care fundamental human right, can’t start segregating treating people don’t like choices they’re morons. 

As much basal/reactionary level agree people saying unvaccinated people deserve fate idiocy. sucks know people everything right unable get vaccinated potentially suffer selfish entitled asshole didn’t want get vaccinated. incredibly, *incredibly* difficult thing turn cheek towards right thing on. 

Of course it’s also much complicated make be. Medical ethics (and ethics general) entire field study. spend years studying stuff, single Reddit comment never going able explain adequately foolproof. ? go online last year making health care administrators wealthy

Insurance stockholders. [""For decades, patients liver disease related alcohol use told must sober six months get liver transplant. even that- they're simply less likely survive covid  sure currently 55% hospitalisations unvaccinated meaning alarming 45% vaccinated. 

You'd assume much fewer vaccinated dying hospital seem get figure.... People worried lockdowns affecting businesses. However, covid causing businesses suffer significantly Florida naturally, people want get sickness. So, congratulations Florida, played yourself... also, lot people dying hospitals near capacity. Let freedom ring! Totally agree. ""wE FiX GeRRyManDeRiNG!""

- GOP 10yrs nature runs course demographic trends Ireland people smart GJ! So… lot little what?  couldn’t believe big dick vocal extremely small minority. problem newspapers give much coverage everyone else, causing people think group much larger really are. bet I’m coming May    absolutely suggest that, suggests there's option priority goes vaccinated individual.

It's terrible awful thing decision needs made, certainly hope 100% agree decision.

Even without vaccine immunocompromised would lower priority situation. I’m left handed confirm omniscient.  Totally agree love - trying reconcile current state affairs Israel? know alcoholic abstain alcohol 6 months considered. true?  probably one try everything options



Shame magic $20 pill something would stopped booster decreased odds getting COVID relative double dosed 60+ 4.2-4.6 times second shot become \~40% protective start with, bring back 85-90% solid example donor organs - alcoholic get replacement liver. /r/punchablefaces graph using data [from using CDC's definition breakthrough May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health importance.

The CDC defines breakthrough case one requires hospitalization. vaccines provide extremely high protection hospitalization. hundreds thousands vaccinated people infected Covid, 6.7k hospitalized. Beloved? surprised me, -- caused post removed r/news, damn shame.   data side effects efficacy third shots literally “efficacy declined old people Israel everybody needs 3rd one!!!!”   fluid situation they’re trying adapt changing conditions. waited data, we’d still waiting first vaccine doses.

We need get comfortable idea decision guidance almost always based imperfect data sometimes things change. do, reassess adapt new conditions. Bacteria alive readily target (antibiotics kill bacteria mostly targeting bacteria's cell walls)

Viruses harder fight since technically alive need interfere use cell machinery replicate: think one look prognosis many drug food addictions strong faith individual ""free will"" support many individuals' self-interests.

Really, best course society actively supports healthier life patterns (high taxes addictive substances; subsidies vegetables, corn &amp; junk food products; bike trails everywhere, congestion charges vehicles, etc). trying rescue succumb unhealthy patterns society encourages. Right, fucking end this. good job making personal choices like adults do. Zero, government pays right Clickbait! We’ll probably need booster jabs every 6 months year, though. vaccine wear time type headline shit article anti-vaxxers wrap claws around grip dear life *irrefutable proof* vaccines don’t work *give you* COVID. like constructed giant multiparty indoor tent dining spaces outdoors comply local ordinances winter  ones protect delta? reason? 

When’s next round coming out? get combo pack? *extremely* great ending. love future (compared conversations early last year).

My family fully vaccinated. mother high risk, it’s still relief. 

I’m happy you. Fur places amount local transmission much higher imported cases even preventing 100% cases essentially meaningless. Hawaii may different given much tourism hub is, still hard imagine benefit substantial given already high level community transmission. Pretty crazy see things typically \*don't\* spiral control areas high vaccination rates!! /s

Sarcasm aside, point clear there's striking correlation vax rates outbreak strength.

Relatively high-vax states seen cases rise, much slowly. leveled out, leveled lower levels. exceptions (OR, WA, HI) really low natural immunity (and event seeing outbreaks better worst states)

Relatively low-vax states getting hammered. exceptions (e.g., Dakota's) off-season, albeit starting see case spread

tl;dr: vaccines still work I’m genuinely confused person thinks differently? Sore throat = get tested. may exposed soon second shot…before boost protection chance kick in. may simply caught another respiratory virus that’s floating around. Good luck, hopefully it’s cold you’ll feel better soon! Good news!!!

""However, even though cases likely continue rise concerning manner near future, rate increase beginning slow, said Prof. Eran Segal, computational biologist Weizmann Institute member Health Ministry's advisory panel.

This already begun happen due recent increases number triple-vaccinated recovered people, said, cautiously predicting increase cases could taper first second week September, leading decline.

""This certain, it’s days we've seeing trend,” “we may see halt spread,” said. “There’s still certainty, scenario looks like it’s starting go direction."" won’t. Watch. amount fucked healthcare professionals saying crazy shit don’t expect triage vaxx status. patient responsibility likelihood recurring infections.

An unvaccinated patient entirely likely wind situation vaccinated undervaccinated individual.

I highly doubt issue even going determining factor many decisions anyways irresponsible use resources one likely come back die rather that's going recover stay away. There’s PLENTY people got Covid, got it, never went hospital whole thing. 

How nice worried stranger pain, also keep worries yourself. rational, reasonable Britons

First time anyone reddit called us that! venn diagram people don’t want get vaccinated don’t care masks mandates basically single circle.

Nope. Lots entitled people think vaccine panacea wearing masks. think difference scenarios describe, people hurting themselves. antivaxers endangering us. one main reasons we’re hospital shortages first place. 

So yeah, maybe I’m cold hearted, there’s one hospital bed left, go either vaxxed person antivaxer (I’m including cannot get vaccinated), definitely think vaxxed person get it. Totally normal point agenda get back normal, people damned. 

Either die won't, damn fuckers want BBQ. Compared previous peaks high though. considering back normal miracle. masks, night clubs open, social distancing.  guess liver transplant based sickest, need abstain alcohol then. Drink up! Honesty? Compared anti vax infected people hospital wishing taken vaccine instead agonizing pain worrying going die. dislike want, happened still happening. governor Florida threatened cut school funding schools instituted mask mandate realized get away threatened pay administrators instead.

Other countries facing difficult ethical questions re-opening, half US seems care. big may sound right need re-evaluate ethics country. People need start taking responsibility health decisions. much blaming actually face consequences decisions. clearly haven’t read “Mask Facts” esteemed epidemiologist Emery Leonard. Get well soon! article saying hospitals cannot staff beds already have. build more? Presumably useful, body producing antibodies would reduce severity/duration administered early enough I’d imagine. Oh it’s ok states everyone vaxxed right??! worried vaxxed? won’t end hospital, right? don’t worried. job also requires this. it’s honor system aren’t requiring proof vaccination. 

Let’s say dishonorable people work KNOW aren’t vaccinated…. news article tagged Opinion? headline fact opinion?   “In first version memo, there,” Fine told me. tried keep note short said doctors don’t lot time read. 
Pretty Half assed. operational Triage guideline scoring system certain variables pt presentation weighed, assigned points, triaged based cumulative score. non vaccinated status result lack resources availability, change weight variable cases. finished reading thread - thank do, years poured becoming MD years ahead you. Although there's part beyond frustrated anti-vaxxers silently thinks need hit back line, completely agree oath - explained clearly, quite well spirit, practice. Keep fighting good fight, truly 💪👍!

~ random Canadian lady choking back tears bus. mild cases vaccinated people. I'd like see source claim. definition mean ""mild"". ""Mild"" cases can, still frequently do, chronic outcomes. mean seems early draw conclusions, could infected time administration, elderly/immunocompromised can't protected 3 shots, we're pretty long road. primary purpose schools function daycare. mean they’re terminally ill, bill isn’t gonna mean much loved ones. inheritance, hopefully won’t thing they’re grieving about… Yea parks thing insane. really wanted discourage anyone leaving house first month April 2020. that, parks thing politicians making rules appease people without input knew talking about. LA County reported 5,799 cases, 193 hospitalizations, 13 deaths fully vaccinated people past week. Maybe, maybe not. takes time behaviour change, people start feeling safe again.  Yes, confirm. tight lockdown since start Texas seems ride every single wave can't trust people community reasonable. Exhausting. way prevent this! Something inexpensive, take lot time effort. ... way...? That's re-statement thing. tells us ""un/vaccinated people serious health symptoms notice hospitals similar levels virus.""

It contradict ""the vaccine prevent lots people ever reaching stage.""  still get it. get hurts personally factually correct answers different questions. question knowledge answer would ""don't know"". question stance, cannot answer ""we know"" means they're anything sucking thumbs. They're things based assumption booster shot needed acknowledge sure assumption correct. problem media took answer twisted answer ""do know"" question.


Here's example: general told men set defense perimeter. reporter asked ""do know enemy's going do"". said ""we know"". reporter asks ""so setting defensive perimeter"". replied ""they could attack anticipating that"". reporter tweeted ""enemy attack coming, army readying defenses"". go LAX? Uncle Law travelled LA get vaxx'd mexico russian chinese vaccines recognized Canada. got COVID right returned first dose. 

Thankfully, even one dose seems helping, feels terrible avoided hospital. 

I heard rumor LA friends LAX basically hot spot itself... way bruthaaaa really people still follow trust CDC says?! Thanksgiving, we'll probably kids' vaccines though. 

If shut down, I'd expect earlier reopen new year, that's big IF. Oh No!

Anyway... know  Couldn’t make argument countries low vaccine rates? say that?  phrase is, “I couldn’t care less”. I’m sure you’re also regularly tender hooks, wouldn’t say boo ghost. 100%. without support many yahoos state. decent majority lot pretty severe nonsense well, deserves lot credit working though latter. Damn, NY nasty Let’s put silly word perspective here...

Silly mock racist character vs mock character clearly intended inform rather cause infighting...

I’d say making fun necessary, said Maddow feels bit like reaching low hanging fruit forgive excuse making-coward boy.

I digress, think us could good bit *ranked choices* channels get support/air time, right *handful billionaires* would rather us other’s throats. doesn’t happen though.

Obese people smokers long times becomes problem them; don’t overload hospitals unless event causing comorbidity express itself.

That’s difference here.

But yes, get rationing care, obese people smokers get deprioritized they’re less likely survive.

That’s pry what’s happening here. don’t vaccine likelihood dying Covid much higher, it’s better use resources treat someone else likely survive.  problem spent last 18 months telling everyone sit house wait serious symptoms instead educating public early treatment options. could wrong heard TV something, need organ transplant, unless wealthy buy way top list, cannot responsible enough take care donated organ denied transplant, think. 

Like need liver transplant can't stop drinking permanently think decide transplant, least prioritize people need liver non alcohol related reasons least shown ability stay sober long period time.

I see situation vaccine similar. course still treat unvaccinated comes last bed ICU vaccinated person prioritized treatment since responsible. Trust scientists correct pandemic, government leads world least corrupt transparent indexes, makes denial?

You're uninformed.  really need nationwide trials hold people like accountable. Every moron local sheriff refused enforce mask mandates, every local politician sabotaged efforts contain virus, every organization deliberately spread misinformation profit political gain. failed us crisis. let go happen next time? learn avoid future let pretend like fight society side virus. That's assumption helpful. Additionally every day passes first dose provides little bit protection. Even someone contract covid soon vaccination, may end bit less severe. Fair point, quitting smoking hell lot harder getting vaccine. Also important think percent people vaccinated number. That’s still incredibly low things considered post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, vast majority people hospital vaccinated. everyone could vaccinated vaccinated, next nobody would hospital.

Breakthrough cases happen, absolutely. driving ICU hospital admissions. even close. adults...

there millions kids mean people CANNOT get vaccine medical reasons doubly SOL? don’t think read whole article.. it? mom eating shit Covid now.. unvaxxed obv. brought guy didn’t mention name. District? haven’t heard yet, don’t trust parents notify school either. Fuck I’ll say it. 

If anti vaxxers come hospital seeking take ICU bed COVID infection, think turned away. 

You’ve quite long time make decision research. gave chances world. THREE vaccines pick from. 

Go home take care “flu” damned bed. Pfizer moderna start working vaccine stupidity? holy crap thank you. terrible Apparently San Francisco's cases dropping. good bad? Guess notifications weren’t turned lol

The fact brought nephrology actually quite head scratcher statements. Renal transplant patients routinely placed quite strict qualifications, including abstaining smoking ETOH, nothing underlying kidney pathology. 

The whole thing big LARP, “I’m kicking hospital not…”. Dude you’re even prescribing Tylenol order without co-sign senior, get lmao. 94% adults.

there millions millions unvaccinated children  sucks someone responsible got vaccinated suffer assholes cases dropped almost directly line schools finished summer. massive proportion positive tests last months school children (i.e. totally unvaccinated community). soon school out, kids stopped mixing sorts numbers normally school cases dropped. How's stepsis anyway sorry already leaving bye curious Agreed places won’t, someone lives large East Coast city, they’re 100% coming back month two it’s major bummer ""Open business"" I’m terribly worried anymore, since I’m vaccinated, I’m back worried 10 month old daughter. lung condition really don’t want take chance getting Covid. pandemic much unfortunately. 

I think lot parents moved concerned older relatives, Covid 1.0, concerned kids Delta times. Moines emergency medicine specialist Dr. Clint Hawthorne, like many doctors Iowa, concerned situation could get worse Iowa State Fair, expected draw 1 million going able handle that?"" Hawthorne said. ""There's good answer that.""

Does virus get people's brains make crave Corndogs?
It's madness people going Iowa State Fair, Disneyland, Sturgis etc. time we're running hospital beds. think post histories for? Need 10 second car?  According Worldometers - Florida \~42K deaths already, China 4.6K

But even multiply reported Chinese deaths 9x - still lower Florida (and that's assuming one trusts numbers DeSantis-land) can't spread diabetes, obesity, lung cancer high blood pressure....they highly contagious deadly viruses...so argument moot... could sold rally events packing venues full unmasked people. moving 7 day average deaths 16 beginning July stands 93 growing according worldometers.info. 5x increase considered ""flat"" nearing 100 deaths day going flu season ""manageable""? Really? ffs seem like public put risk.

Especially given real choice whether interact cops not. think foregone conclusion school openings cause another wave. get young children vaccinated, proven young children transmit COVID well. also think likely prolonged wave continue Fall given much immunity people current wave. Lastly, think schools make much difference little social isolation going outside schools. Travel barely budged summer, restaurant bar visits remained fairly steady. like last year everyone isolating home sending kids school.

It seems like everyone already decided cases rise September October, think fall months. Correct. Cant send kid home either. bed bugs. Cant tell families send kid home I'm sure coincidence cases syrocketing right time schools finished summer, plummeted straight down.

In June/July bring three kids home school due someone seperate classes testing positive covid - one twice inside 1 month.  already make similar triage decisions organ transplants. think heavy smokers way priority list comes new lungs. Sinovac allowed countries children older 3 years, definitely possible.  “T R G E” OP, fully vaxxed eating/drinking indoor restaurants bars data prevalence long covid breakthrough infections much clear. many unknowns throw caution wind, I'm ""full lockdown"" mode anymore either. gone back kn95 masks vs cloth masks public spaces though. data showed efficacy would increase 86%? news came yesterday?  easy lot redditors cheer on, reality sad fraught ethical decisions stick people long time. hate come this, reasons multifactorial. trouble public health always trying protect people themselves, seeing scale none us ever seen before. mean this? think huge difference ""we know often boosters needed"" ""we anticipating need every year"".

Same ""we need boosters yet"" ""we know need boosters"" Covid going way show us care politics, it'll infect anyone. hospital gets overran people smokers obese, I’m okay treating least obese first. reason think COVID ever peter become endemic like many claim? seems every article says happen says happen that’s always happens, there’s even sliver hope happen COVID.  I’m surprised they’re even checking books That’s pretty amazing true. Especially that’s what’s observed 60+ cohort Somebody made mind reading article. least they’re willing backtrack rather double-down. Maybe.  understandable, applaud way think. never wish harm ill anyone, main difference made everyone angry illness affects diagnosed. Im frustrated too, I've seen toll taken us healthcare, still dealing with. happy im also mad man call critical whos treatment failing he's critical wbc levels getting blood work done hall bc can't fit in. surgeries shutting again, people sitting next covid positive people er bc theres rooms left sit lobby begging help whove come emergency kidney pain stroke. Anyways, unvaccinated choice taking rooms responsible different intentionally hurting themselves. shitty situation in, while.  There’s really nursing shortage, it’s shortage nurses willing continue get shit kicked unsafe nursing ratios hospitals want take patient shifts. 

Source: last day week ago I’m 6 resigned 3 week period. Well, don’t feed hot dogs people might choke (infants toddlers), wear seat belts cars use car seats (all legally forced us) don’t sell booze minors, last checked death toll things combined won’t touch 6 million dead people world wide two years, keep going bubble data add terms real world numbers. 60% Israelis fully vaccinated, yet current spike trending high previous spikes, pre vaccine. think vaccine effective Delta. study missing something. LIBRARY. prescription referral? library. Labor Day weekend Atlanta host 40,000 people Dragon Con tens thousands Alabama vs Miami SEC game weekend hotels. go great.

The convention least requiring masks well vax negative test result still seems like landmine. getting downvotes think need /s really. Many states don’t even require ID get vaccinated encourage illegal immigrants fear vaccination.

Not states records, ones don’t everyone. many actually intelligent, well educated people using real science technology track ""new"" variants may variants concern interest. Buzzwords trash.

Read. Consider. Understand. 

Take deep breath. virus evolving, science watching happen planning next. Stay safe. good others. Uninsured underinsured vaccinated? That's crazy! see mandatory vaccines another lockdown. mandatory, mean basically able participate society, forced anything.  can't tell making joke idea I'm talking game...  DeSantis school’d. Seeing Nebraska isn’t even reporting cases deaths *at all?*

And Florida lying numbers whole time?

Yeah it’s worse Wuhan ever lmao 71% reduction hospitalization wouldnt issues hospital capacity.   reason believing good idea punishing antivaxers. believe getting vaccine means likely better outcome likely listen doctor follow care instructions. disregard medical advice refusing vaccine likely disregard advice take medications prescribed follow physical respiratory therapy follow appointments. care rationed going follow medical advice. It’s important factor vaccinated likely survive due least immunity. care rationed go best chance surviving.  Ya, live Fort Worth thought high prices expensive homes rip. Yeah isn’t great all, much dislike antivaxxers still hate see needless death especially droves Delta burned UK population quickly, probably helped 80% population fully vaccinated. Less hospital resources need taken way. India mad scramble families trying find oxygen tanks, even empty ones, fill supply ill family members. People sitting cars oxygen tank next door oxygen hose running window person sitting passenger seat back seat treatment available. comes point deaths increase necessarily due virus itself, due conditions require hospitalization yet beds open offer timely adequate treatment. reason reducing curve emphasized strongly start pandemic. point southern US curve approaching vertical line many ICUs beds least staff needed work ICU beds, effectively keeping service. Even Covid patients currently ICU recover fully gain natural immunity, help people meantime heart attacks strokes getting injured hospital nearby take in. can't hit snooze heart attack tell happen hospitals room.

Yes, variant going give lot people exposure antibodies due effectiveness spreading, mean come high cost. never get fumbling mask shit early on. Yea sure data say masks prevented transmission... DATA ALL.

You telling consistently messaging masks generally good precaution new respiratory virus bad science?

I really wonder much politics came play despite CDC supposedly independent-ish everyone unvaccinated anti-vax conspiracy nut. 

No, they're Asimov's professed confident ignorants. ignorance screwing economy preventing us getting back normal lofe, oh no, they're risking lives quality life hundreds millions.

Based on......? ignorant cows shove preservatives/dyes/emulsifiers/""fillers"" (USDA jargon) gullets 6 times day without question

They're selfish, deluded, stupid fucks. Full stop. Ty  question virus asks. suggesting doctors disrespect patient's choice. Part might related [the change way report Well, yeah. cooties Many people - especially need most. dad, heart issues. uncle, multiple strokes died last month. isn’t even counting others experience life-threatening infections like u_Mr_Boneman. reverberating effect fans people trying access preventative care can’t even get resources tied up.  one told it’s “experimental”. Npr said September 20th today they? Non vaccinated?
To morgue. 

Next! way predict new waves Covid-19. Article says likely due schools. knew? me, looks like Pfizer **the best** vaccine Wuhan variant, novel variants late 2020 early 2021.

I like news hear efficacy delta, hate spoonfed bits pieces data. Contradictory statements officials certainly help.

 summer I've living lived COVID, last couple weeks feel like I'm January 2020, waiting bad news.  supporting it: appreciated thought provoking comment Why? largest union supports mandate announced much right announcement. it’s anything like nursing unions, majority either go silent. Delta vaccine resistant. British study found Pfizer's vaccine effective symptomatic disease Delta, compared 95% wild-type. comparison, Pfizer's vaccine effective Beta variant, know Beta vaccine resistant. 

Moderna tested using 3rd booster original vaccine, Beta-specific vaccine, results different: (Slide 29, mRNA-1273.351 Beta-specific vaccine)

So would think decided using original vaccine good enough, reworking production line variant-specific boosters getting approval worth benefit. lmfao seethe allow religious exemptions folks. ER needs put tents chairs parking lot treat citizens care thy neighbor first. I'm telling you, there's something up. First, T-Mobile 5G coverage this. mean capacity restrictions, closing bar service, libraries, museums, etc. Masks next nothing (especially paper cloth masks people wear) indoor dining entertainment full-capacity if/when gets worse close things grave matter, happened Hippo!? Ok, cite source don’t guess it?  distinction always clear, especially smaller hospitals anyway. Well obviously. Well Sharon helpful set Beach Body diet, would wrong this? fair, response also incredibly slow start, she’s prodded act numerous occasions, including stuff. Ted Wheeler fucking people got take seriously last year.   Education. Wish 'merika declining resistance annual jab, us choose annual jab. It’s big hassle. guy last week rather significant head injury car accident really hard time finding bed him. also covid. illustration fallacious belief choice managing pandemic economic well-being. wish could say people stupid, past 20 months requires qualify that: lot people America stupid. 

They know things COVID situation worsening becoming dangerous curb activity ways damage economy. Stories overloaded ICU's mortuary trucks people dying unnecessarily - directly due COVID say stroke victim can't get care need EMS hospitals past capacity - cropping up. become prevalent - inevitably places like Florida Texas - people adopt version shelter place, especially time younger people getting hit harder previous waves. I'm vaccinated yet bcs hardly find place providing Johnson's vaccine. Multiple REALLY late term abortions. Waiting 5th district. Protect kids! don’t know clear way state it. guess said things go back thing first happened last year. Events getting canceled worldwide, people India getting asses kicked police wearing masks, people Hazmat suits China setting check points &amp; checking everyone’s temperature….I’ll specific next time sake downvotes. Except children rare medical exception. let many many unpaid bills go collection 20s 30's. shitty barely livable job looking several thousand dollar bill made laugh cry. never paid dime shit. real job insurance. good god healthcare system need revamping. Uhhh, sure. refuse treatment, continue behavior, magical STD imagining infectious/harmful/deadly COVID?

Have ever selfawarewolves? would love there! Multnomah County 70+% vax rate, Portland’s probably fine. Eugene 62% vax rate, trending national average. It’s Union Medford asking about. This. Efficacy noticeably less days. Yep, Israel study. Probably age. That's big consideration comes organ transplants. makes lot sense give young person. guy fucks ground zero. Repulican't Party goes tubes. close extinction, speak. murdering own. Age also helps. 20 year old recipient likely beat 85 year old one in, stolen? Boosted? *Hijacked!?* 25,000 lot people lose. bad kick virus' ass. Herd immunity! Congratulations!!! Love different countries helping other. interesting exchanges. disagree we’ll enough immunity 2-3 months case We're really quibbaling meaning essential. hear saying disagree it. That's said important. think idea you’re hoping people vaccinated quit know it’s coming. 

But mean, check counties fueling surge. Union’s sheriff wrote ridiculous letter freedom her, Newberg’s busy trying pretend gay people don’t exist. weren’t going listen anyway. nowhere else post this, day saw guy interstate riding motorcycle, wearing N95 mask helmet. republican voters I'd assume... reddit

I feel like people expecting much every little statement, honestly. get people want answers like uncertainty there's nothing certain virus. comes covid, uncertainty expectation people want opposite. Obey die? Yeah get 3? yes it’s free. Kids 12 eligible vaccines. They're willing try something lot less testing mRNA. Fucking amazing. Yup. pushing eviction requirements tenants well.  concern low income disabled people don’t access. mentioned Yet leading medical ethicist studies COVID-19 affects communities says worries adding vaccination status triage patients unfairly harm low-income people people color. groups historically disadvantaged comes obtaining proper medical care.  Banning flights isn’t lockdown sense word. mean Taiwan done everything open there. complain getting downvoted that’s pretty broad inane question countries completely different policies lockdowns. True, vaccination status primary factor deciding triage care. 25 year old unvaccinated probably prioritized 90 year old vaccinated. However, factors equal, comes difference vaccination status, yes vaccinated people better chance survival. course, become really subjective determining whether things actually ""equal"" puts lot stressful ethical decisions onto medical personnel.  
 
Forcing hospitals triage mode bad thing. Data? Nah. CDC clearly prefers say whatever people want hear… CDC pisses people later actual data means CDC guidance rotten. 

You’d think as, don’t know, CENTER DISEASE CONTROL CDC would know mitigating risk following science. 

Nope. covid vaccine free everywhere? I’ve 3 free shots don’t even insurance. Masks low-cost NPIs work. matter bad gets lockdowns required make cases drop immediately.

This happened literally every wave everywhere world.  Isn’t 82% great? Article 21st July. tl;dr - 90% people age 60 hospitalized bad case Israel unvaccinated, vs 10% fully vaccinated.

If vaccinated old, 1/10 chance severe case even without booster.

The numbers probably even better younger population. that's worst delta surge ripping entire population. Life normal get vaccine  often actually recorded way, recent 11 yr old death mengicoccal Covid Delta, logged death Covid, old folks home large transmission occurred same, cases pneumonia etc, recorded instead. Medical professionals standards, plus ultimately Govt certainly want higher Covid reporting, influence, pressure way, anything, seems likely pretty balanced.  rural counties rabidly anti-vaxx now. letting natural selection run course.

When resources scarce think justifiable graph also lists hospitalizations though… dont think main reason. Amen.  ... seems reports coming saying vaccinated spread Delta easily similarity high viral load? Although vaccine still effective reducing hospitalization Get shot available want to, gonna stop making time soon. Sure, almost 100 100 huge difference like said yourself. 98 vs 99 still lot death. 95, even more. vaccine great, amazing really, considering probably 5% hospitalizations states among vaccinated, let's also report properly.

This war fighting. Yep, honestly happened last year get vaxx change:

1) Kids kids spreading germs

2) We're going fall/winter, colds flus get worse Yes, indeed. Psychologically, people would rather try something feel like took good gamble ""give up"" nothing, even nothing outcome. patient refuses chemotherapy quality life, may stillbdie either way, often receive criticism ""not fighting."" according Google stats.

Aug 18 2020:

Cases waaaaay up, deaths (although percentage deaths vs cases lower) Lord, went SEC school, imagining typical game day back then, stadiums least issues. start partying hours huge parties after, know aren’t stopping.  I’m questioning that.
I’m asking possible vaccinated person who’s body abilities fight lower spread covid still enough viral load person isn’t vaccinated benefiting body reacting covid. yes, wonder vanishing antibodies 6 months, leaving 2 month window what? protection? diminished sort kind protection? knows what, we'll find 8 months maybe? least advocating vaccine.

The vaccine enabling immune system prepared respond infection quicker; way able rid infection overwhelm unstimulated immune system cause life-threatening illness. Sometimes means immune system respond virus establish foothold. sometimes not; symptoms infection appear similar similar replication levels. yet, although we’ve declared soft Code Able (external disaster) sent flairs. vaccinated shed much unvaccinated take away reason lots people got vaccinated, would spread it. understand, still less likely catch it, possibly likely capable spreading many days? 6000 Houston area alone, today weed Jaw dropping.

Elimination mean never cases. example, say measles eliminated US, time time infection abroad results outbreak. thanks effective disease control measures outbreaks quickly suppressed.

The situation COVID-19 China New Zealand exactly analogous. cases due infection brought abroad escape border controls. China, robust quarantine measures mean recent outbreak originating Nanjing airport quickly brought control. Yesterday, number new cases COVID-19 community four (4) across entire country; three stemming Nanjing outbreak, one coming border Myanmar. fully expect number back zero within next days.

As animal reservoirs, yes exist, neither China New Zealand recorded even single case transmission animal human. cases animal-to-human transmission reported elsewhere minks humans, exactly high-risk route many people. Breeders aware take appropriate precautions. 

Even Nature article cited states ""More one-third respondents Nature’s survey thought would possible eliminate SARS-CoV-2 regions continued circulate others. zero-COVID regions would continual risk disease outbreaks, could quenched quickly herd immunity people vaccinated."" pretty much situation polio measles, pursue COVID too? China New Zealand proved already done 20% world's population, even single vaccine available. think got workers cleaning breaks something  friends make livelihood service industry, outdoor festival events, theatre. They're vaccinated I'm sympathetic frustration things keep getting cancelled.

And I've working in-office whole pandemic, place plain enforce mask mandate. I've constantly exposed whole time, I'm vaccinated. wear mask I'm asked to. I'll get booster shot timeframe health officials recommend so.

But I'm going distance. reason travel, even reason ""I want to,"" will. Maybe makes callous irresponsible, can't continue shoulder burden people help themselves. hospitals collapsing get vaccinated, behavior change that.

Whoever decided virus political complete moron. related question: anyone developing vaccine booster specigically targets delta variant, perhaps variant gaining rapidly? eventually need move vaccines target old wild-type SARS-CoV-2, right? 94% adults, smaller percentage overall u18 population. actual percentage population antibodies closer 80% children vaccinated yet. countries higher percentage vaccinated people, percentage vaccinated people hospitals course higher. country 100% people would vaccinated, 100% people hospitals would vaccinated well.

In Belgium, 1 3 people covid hospitals vaccinated now. half found infected routine tests going treatments, I'll covid. 82% adults fully vaccinated here. means 82% population 1/6 serious cases remaining 18% responsible 4/6.
This also country going hospital going leave huge bill, people wait extremely ill go hospital.

Of hospital (over here), small percentage vaccinated people ends ICU, vaccine still protects well. ...as opposed pouring vaccine skin like water.  Serious enough put kid er hospital 3 days. I’ve got picture corpse body bag Covid would make sense.

Edit ... sorry say might make sense case. mich evidnce dont know. difficult sometimes pick apart actual research speculation media reports. He’s blatantly saying money valuable peoples lives… could COVID good business ? mean would want dine-in go bar local hospitals collapsing? 🤦‍♂️ yup I'd completely agree. would literally new virus support complete lockdown think. also pay twice live get settlement. (Going car accident) still free LFT's order well. honest, ordered save I'm seeing anyone old vulnerable. imagine things ask test going forwards though thought I'd in. crawl kids' backpack home crawl another kids' backpack school. Nasty things. That... anything near same.  what’s problem that? countries going do. Booster shots mean. Based exactly? Sounds like another carrot stick. I’m vaccination need stop talking circles speculating. problem fears vaccination promulgated exacerbated people vaccinated whose kids wear masks mandated private schools.

Yet people find amusing others paying targeted misinformation, health lives. i've heard deadly one sure contagiousness he’s racist then. see dragging babies rope behind car, you? Exactly...not far enough right! anybody realized sub become r/politics  friend mine went bald early 20s. Maybe time “But there’s surge.”

Let's settle 4 millions argument's sake.

At 1% IFR (the assumed IFR Western demographics) would mean 400 millions infected. Given India younger population one would expect much less, time collapse health system would raise number, halve IFR 0.5%, meaning 800 millions infected, meaning 57% population virus. 

Plainly, still enough avoid next wave, might help affected areas. GFs (fully vaccinated) brother (fully vaccinated) tested positive covid yesterday. saw five days ago. took lateral flow test yesterday returned negative result. safe interact people?

That's there's still great protection death, little less hospitalization, 40s symptomatic illness. Pfizer uses lower initial dose Moderna (30ug vs 100ug), probably effectiveness symptomatic drops 6 months, Moderna yet, they're similar hospitalization death still. Wow, hope enough product everyone.

Look, unofficially, get booster whenever want. prove immunocompromised, like prove already vaccinated that. We're throwing doses thousands, there's ethical concern line jumping.

I know they're justifying 8 months, lot people, we're taking recommendations Israel's health authority, they're full world class experts too. CDC seems risk-averse even accept data countries, insist waiting til numbers get confirmed here, finally happened 2 weeks ago Mayo Clinic study. kept saying 'the data show that'... Fauci specifically asked TV, 'What's Israel seeing we're not' answered data there, we'll wait see happens data. Like we're different species different strain. watching attention since July, bc Spain seemed two three weeks behind, also Delta variant. felt little relaxed cases started decline.

We seeing even steeper decline well, maybe still restrictions place schools still closed.

I agree risk sanitary collapse seems over. think Lt. Governor implying Governor got covid black servants, maybe? Lazy eyed psycho 1. figure adults.
2. ""Herd immunity"" requires fairly even distribution immunity reliable. large pockets people congregating vaccinated...

2. means herd immunity forever grasp COVID-19 us forever.

3. billions people even first vaccination time West getting third. also understand works. Agreed eventually see mortality continue drop (though older populations may still get I'll enough die). stating one get again. 

The best course action everyone remains get vaccinated, whether not. _why say anything_, then? recent report stated 60% deaths vaccinated month ago likely since then

France, according supposedly hates vaccines even higher 54.5% vs Americas 51.7% (Norway Finnland roughly 45% comparison, least according Google).  94% apparently lol

Edit: assuming consistent across nation ofc. Hi, sorry, wanted highlight everyone thread seems referring England, UK.
*must get political, must get political*

In Wales, wear masks law shops/large indoor areas public transport still. Social distancing still recommended work home mandate partially lifted. also gigs happening outside pre-approved test schemes.

From experience here, masks part life. I've never seen someone refuse wear shop pretty common see old people go walks masks.
The biggest thing I've noticed young. chavs back train blast music throw chips never used wear masks, despite rules.
Since Delta started ripping young population England, kids come across started wearing masks. Thank account. really helpful, makes feel little better hair loss might vaccine related.. wonder something else unique me? yeah might bring next tele-health session. Thanks again. get jab, think still give people knucks Peru somewhat older population tha India, though. equal conditions, would expect fewer deaths India. Yay, late! Actually, ""entered"" wave early July (exponential growth started back then).

But case numbers high enough general public notice, guess. We're close weekly rate 50 cases per 100k, used ""more restrictions needed"" threshold vaccines. Yes vast majority one dose simply waiting second dose. look travelling tabby covid site graphs first second doses time see two dose vaccination rate roughly one dose vaccination rate 8 weeks ago. Another pro-lifer proving he’s anything but. else would vaccine go?? thinks we’ll needing boosters forever.

Me thinks like flu shot every fall probably good idea. 

It's bit meme, bears repeating: Covid-19 like flu. case, that's actually good thing.

The flu caused multiple different viruses family. different variants, actually different viruses. that's one problem. next one flu viruses mutate even rapidly coronaviruses. top up, genetic data influenzaviruses segmented several strands, opposed single long strand RNA like coronaviruses. means 2 different influenzaviruses infect cell, cell produce new influenzaviruses using RNA segments two invaders, mixing matching create new forms virus.

All properties together result fact vaccinating flu vastly difficult vaccinating anything else vaccines against. also flu shot commonly used vaccine updated seasonally.

Other vaccines, childhood vaccines, shots (1-3 typically) done.

So still need booster covid-19? we're sure yet best prime-boost interval is. childhood vaccines mentioned considerably longer delays shots covid-19 vaccines. running vaccine 6+ month delay shots several trial phases amidst ongoing pandemic good idea, vaccine researchers essentially took shortest interval still made sense: weeks. experience vaccines suggest longer intervals provide much robust long lasting protection. Based death certificate reporting 600 people died Covid latest reported week, likely higher week based daily reports. yes 100 deaths Covid day. death toll based death certificates excess deaths consistently higher based covid testing, idea daily counts full people dying car crashes covid positive reality. reports? anybody even care anymore?

As terrible sounds thr reality people care thr Pandemic anymore, many covid-19 another virus. Hair loss side effect vaccine. Pierce nowhere near high. I'm City Council one cities last figure got Monday 48% city. I'm Pierce County Regional Council well briefed last month aggregate numbers Pierce 10% behind statewide average 20% Seattle Metro. naive. Hospitilisations already 1/4 peak pandemic, summer schools closed. really nothing stop cases hospitalitions rising come winter, highly likely see reintroductin restrictions months time.

Regarding covid death stats, also tracked death certificates, covid death count reported death certificates consistently higher daily death counts based covid testing.

Your comment reminds people acting like covid last summer, saying variants nonsense sub January. I'll accussed scaremongering stating obvious. boyfriend received Pfizer vaccine experienced abnormal hair loss. Obviously can't speak others, though. become bothersome issue you, recommend addressing doctor, can. beginning August 2019, Covid, husband's caregiver. various conditions kept us lockdown.

My husband passed (not due Covid) June 2020. California, many places closed off. remained lockdown.

I've followed restrictions. I'm fully vaxxed. CDC said May 2021 could remove masks indoors, kept wearing mine. Delta proved decision right.

Keep mind, locked months Covid. Thanks Delta variant, value playtime actually helping end pandemic, responsible choices still limited.

I've canceled many plans, gave making new ones. right thing do.

- loving this? NO!!!
- resent insist prolonging pandemic? YES!!!
- absolve responsibility keep part, matter what? HELL, NO!!!

But make major advocate vaccine mask mandates, adults get back living lives, responsibly. [Here good information 27 risk (of hospitalisation) unvaccinated people 50 around 10 times higher* risk vaccinated people.

the risk (of hospitalisation) unvaccinated people 50 around 12 times higher* risk vaccinated people. concept vaccine equity - either desirable normal - absurd... 
The two main factors determining mortality COVID-19 old age obesity, far prevalent certain areas world, makes sense vaccination take much higher priority there... You’re implying you’ll stage play rate Lambda reporting likely little scaremongering.

The Lambda variant emerged months Delta, yet never even got close gaining dominance except specific regions highly transmissible variant time.

If look relative prevalence chart different variants note Lambda peaked 3% sequenced samples around April year. time, Delta already 10%. Since then, Delta increased prevalence 86%, Lambda gradually declined 1%. think completely missed point maybe misread? I’ve two Moderna shots stopped wearing mask, contradictory information regarding CDC guidance seems like we’re probably going get matter do. probably reasonable expect antibody rates high children due rampant spread likely schools peak.

Depends mean high, expect even 50%. kids vaccinated, infection rates high. set boundaries ""resets progress significantly"". look deaths hospitalisations proportion cases UK's latest wave compared previous waves, vaccines demonstrably working incredibly well. We've lifted remaining restrictions, still holding true. 

I think ""escape"" needs mean ""significantly overcomes vaccine's ability prevent serious illness death"", UK's example last months think Delta qualifies that.

Boosters therapeutics continue erode effects virus, we're already manageable state get better continue vaccinate holdouts. 

Thanks vaccines btw. get wrong, much criticise UK's response pandemic overall, think vaccination effort showing path covid society-crippling crisis, something not-ideal-but-manageable-and-getting-better. hope States follows, especially vaccine-skeptics realise billions people already vaccinated keeling growing horns whatever they're expecting. defense, types don’t give shit healthcare education guess it’s business usual? know there’s political party LOVES uneducated populace well.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

There's also suggestions people Covid carry smaller viral load they're exposed (making less likely spread it).

Anecdotally, went gig little brother last week. 
He (single vaccinated) really bad case Covid, partner (double vaxxed) symptomless positive (previously infected, single vaxxed) came back negative 🤷 pessimist think delta new beginning virus. never seen variant much sub lineages like delta. Delta continues evolve worry. example country, saw delta lineages carry N501Y E484K(worst mutation vaccines) also AY.1(K417N),AY.2, AY.3. something like covid 19.2 would delta EU 63% least one dose US 60%.

True, let's honest, March 2020, brutal wave little known time virus spread. hindsight absurd much people like bash government that, made sense time (some things like walking dogs kids, able go bars parks lockdowns began lifted, didn't, core measure did).

In August 2021, limiting exercise one hour reasonable excuse, looks like sadism sake it. People always dying quickly since 3/20. course people, take while, die quickly. April 2020 husband, ER doc, coworker-another doctor test positive. wife go stay mom's house that's lot healthcare workers quarantining away family. got positive test Wednesday, talked wife Thursday afternoon found Friday morning. Covid vascular disease really, autopsies see tons little micro clots everywhere. hive people heart attacks, pulmonary embolism, stroke, end stage organ disease, brain damage, etc. One word: tourism 
They couldn’t afford another summer without foreign tourists takes big chunk economy many EU countries. Ironic though EU blocked much higher vaccination rate USA.   Boosters then. Everyone eligible able get it. done end year. Probably not, though. Lambda new AY.3 variant potentially problematic. wanna travel. bought tix NYC friends Labor Day weekend (we’re vaccinated). don’t know even go more. Sorry American, Irish. need Irish passport that.

Have even Irland? Could excess deaths delayed care due covid covid itself? covid adjacent death? saying shouldn’t count wouldn’t reported differently? They're requiring inside outside correct? Honestly right located required period. NJ requiring schools open medical offices optional everywhere else. Virus spread higher near southern states. Honestly see people wearing masks everywhere. Vaccination rate also ticking up. want take shot microgram mRNA vaccines, take 2 galleon DNA veins. Moderna dosed 3 times Pfizer. children, producers looking much smaller doses, hopefully much less side effects.   guess that's sorta relief personally. wonder pfizer much much dramatic dip efficacy.

I'll sure keep parents updated it. Thanks info.   really don’t understand Europe simply closes border US. Reciprocity basic rule things. privileged take. living 12m2 windowless room first lockdown. wait over. know downvoted that. Federal government cannot shut interstate travel. get they're hypothesizing, conjecture point. think key takeaway they're realizing vast majority Americans take another booster shot 3rd. Like take annual flu shot? think they're starting brainstorm Plan B... meaning truly going endemic, hospitals going swamped passing wave unless staffing boosted. Market forces alone correct staffing shortage quick enough, see CDC asking feds step recruit hs &amp; college grads form kind emergency covid health corps. study Mayo Clinic US. showed similar results Pfizer, efficacy infection falling around 42% 5 months. Moderna much better 76%. seems Moderna much higher dosage. still drop protection (it initially 95% both, IIrc), much less drastic.  long time since I’ve seen sentiment expressed, though remember it.

Difficult necessary certainly enough viewpoint restrictions, frankly correct one essentially anyone average person policy maker. recognizes value NPIs losing sight real trade-offs kinds things. damn obvious going need boosters. even make comment like did? say ""we cannot comment time. still get one."" Hope so. Maybe force act. person floor background kid, sure they're years old. probably gotten vaccine yet, unfortunately.   might necessarily know yet whether antibodies fade booster not, seems they've pretty much figuring go. think childhood vaccines US, almost given multiple doses (3 4 cases), shots need spaced time full immunity built. majority final dose occurring 6 months previous one. 

Obviously there's way know one work way, maybe. Hopefully worst case would combined yearly flu shot. people. People choosing vaccinated wear mask. governor republican even said wants people vaccinated. Somehow confused conservative disastrous health decisions.

That would put overall population vaccination rates somewhere 50-60%, go quickly they're vaccinating kids (I think 16-18 year want happen? 90% adults 1 dose, they'll second coming weeks. headline says, 94% adults antibodies. 

Frankly, care vaccinated people passing vaccinated people, risk either serious illness death minimal, even gone away altogether. Unfortunately, frail unhealthy people going keep dying forever, along handful otherwise healthy edge-cases. mean, remaining unvaccinated, they're taking chances.

**Edit:** BTW efficacy claim Pfizer significantly wrong - wondering anyone experiencing hair loss took Pfizer? male (22), never problem losing hair now. 11 days since 1st shot administered.

Like run hand hair (length: bangs touch bottom lip), lot strands come (sometimes clumps). 

Really scared.... someone shed light situation offer advice/articles.

Thank you. agree one thing Philippines colony US anymore use PH instead PI means different Filos tho (P*tang Ina = M*therf*cker). Brace     Yea heard Israel's reports it. curious moderna sorta silent ""might"" need booster.

This delta lambda variants gonna wreck us that's sure, hope get data points within month so. Getting researchers key.    Yeh 25-32 age group getting 2nd jab bump numbers. it’s anyone 18, done. Shouldn’t long. good remember Alpha still too... vaccine still helping that. Speculation. Anyway, perhaps dosing schedule 3 shots getgo. may find ""booster"" truly kicks immune system gear. Studies shown delaying 2nd dose 12 weeks (vs 3/4 advised) produces far robust immune response. 
 
If original approval 3 dose scheduling would Americans vaccinating population first (in terms months) still offensive? Long covid significant problem, going cause serious healthcare consequences going forward. America every right take care people vaccines first choose. vote America. Florida running 20% test positive rate clear indication there’s enough testing done. lot undocumented cases there. 4 5 dentists got Covid also recommended Colgate Adults vaccinated much 70 - overall population that’s, new measure since started vaccinating kids, level metrics count, feel like kind shifting goalposts here. matter vaccinated not, develop another active infection, pass everyone unvaccinated person. Additionally, assumption suffering severe illness also incorrect. moment, majority ICUs fully vaccinated. Yeah, Ohio, everyone dropped masks long time ago, even CDC recommendation. 8 months thing, honestly know. CDC said single thing wait 8 months. mean, said ""everyone still well protected point according data have"" maybe ""waiting 8 months allows robust immune response"", etc., I'd feel better wait, seem real reasoning it, data waning immunity Pfizer vaccine suggests happens way (about 5-6 month mark). .... thing is, one even need trust science anymore believe vaccine safe.

Immunity sliding scale people antibodies still get mildly pass wouldn’t let hospital administrators babysit dead goldfish much less manage sick ICU patient Beyond happy decision. mandatory masking schools, I’m beyond grateful he’s actually listening science.

However. Virtual learning needs offered. It’s pipe dream assume year two pandemic done like normal school year. Covid cases going jump kids without doubt it’s going force districts go virtual.

I sincerely hope gov touches speech today. Families need know effective plan place cases spike here. they’ve already done quickly. “These results highly encouraging. suggest third booster may restore vaccine efficacy original levels”

Right, concern waning immunity. plan re-vaxx every 8 months, out? gf nurse one major hospitals Chicago fed up. six patients every nurse terrible. comes home every day drained honestly know anymore. says boss good manager hands tied higher ups. hospital truly values profits staff patients. fucking sick.

Nj here, governor also announced virtual option school year. absurd touch. understand teachers beyond overworked, asking super tech savvy run class online limited resources lot.

But. It’s hugely discriminating omit remote learning option. many disabled/sick students benefit it.

I homeschooling three kids (under vax age) since March 2020. I’m sending back public school mental health declined much 17 months pandemic.

We mandatory masking schools, gov supposed announce today mandatory vaccines teachers school staff. decisions make feel safe sending kids school. However remote learning option needs available. see cases spike, especially children, I’ve doubt many states revert back online learning.


I want nothing things back normal. I’m also willing homeschool kids long necessary help save teachers students. know else bad you? Prolonged isolation crippling loneliness. remember UK COVID subreddit full lockdown.

Its enough see lockdown difficult, necessary. Instead, need think actually great thing, anyone wants go bars alcoholic, anyone wants see friends family extroverted zoom calls instead. 

That's without even considering abusive households, homes lack space etc. point expecting different results. course Delta going lead people higher viral load. previous results apply.

Maybe read comment replying to. Vaccines late last year readily available free adults kids 12 May. time people told wait long possible hospitals capacity. Like vaccine readily available along masks yet people refuse both. Boggles mind honestly. heard called intradermal injection.. 100% sure.

But also heard method way painful. Please clap. Absolute Muppets. experts.

US bad shape, particularly Florida, common tourist destination Europeans Canadians. tourists start coming in, there's still going breakthrough cases, even rules vaccinated only. likely, it'd vaccinated negative covid test, meaning vulnerable get US. adds strain healthcare systems.

Furthermore, tourists means people vacation things, tend come along higher risks accidents. areas hospitals may actually unable properly treat people normal accidents medical conditions due covid surge.

It nothing thinking people risk bringing covid everything US already struggling take care population unable add foreign tourists top it. Right... bait titles getting control. contradicts claims ""peaking September"" Labor Day, well UK saw. bet would see numbers live (exact opposite side country).  so? large group people refuse mask, social distance, get vaccine, kids bearing consequences that... reason think kids' parents exhibiting behavior.

You sound awful ignorant mRNA vaccines someone pushing onto others without much, knowledge TV tells you, use “how many flu shot” argument valid points. She’s even considered exposure tested positive yesterday, unless symptoms day something. Typically people contact 48 hours prior positive test symptom onset would considered contacts. It’s podcast done virologists immunologists. basically read latest papers give opinions analysis. show existed COVID obviously much popular now. “This week Virology”. amazing resource times. sensible person wants wear masks forever 28 year old healthy condition outside ER three weeks ago breakthrough case Covid. may able answer question.

Thankfully Southern California one top hospitals. doctor ER saying wasn’t readily available many places back then. I’m glad hospitals using moment really way look it. I've seen non-peer reviewed write ups testing Sinovac. clearly far less infectious, around good new delta variant. Could become something? knows there's reason think even close delta terms impact. I’m also Italian much Fox News (even tho Fox requiring it’s employees vaccinated, wear masks submit testing … rich). Vaccine uptake. Supply could infinite. Doesn’t matter half population believes drunken uncle says it’ll turn lizard person track you. 

It’s US either. less expected usage multiple countries. IMO variants never stop point. It’ll like flu we’ll target prevalent variant year. long everyone wants vaccine get one, that’s bar care about. Beyond that, stockpiling based assuming everyone accept one bit silly point.

BULLFUCKING SHIT

Vaccinated STILL getting way much long covid problems worried. Yeah, PROBABLY wont die, covid still fuck shit up. thankful stringent mandate passed yesterday. However wanted highlight difficulties epidemiologists gov officials having/ going have...22-27% population (not individuals, families children cannot get vaccine) likely affluent, non minority, possibly well educated actively safety/betterment society... keeps up, consequences mentality reach far beyond pandemic.... ground hog day nightmares. Yeah don’t even know approximate number

I'm trying make mathematical determination, social judgment likelihood sad number parents care politics kids. china's pov, coutries can't control pandemic argue china choose let virus run beyond reason, saying, 'if others ate sh*t, would you?' work healthcare (or know someone healthcare) thought much consequences overflowing hospitals predict this... blatantly obvious would happen, especially last winter warm-up. Nothing going change people's minds anyway. Even article exist would come kind crackpot theory justify they're getting vaccinated. asking that? think lot people 80+ also middle aged younger seniors immunocompromised.

But I'm sure healthy, fully vaccinated, 30 somethings too. many cases unlikely things happen, frequently.  anxiety went fine resisting urge go pull physically building.

Why resist? Yank out. Canadian perspective would much prefer close border rather open ways. understand huge hardship people every time see US license plate think ""Well, there's delta, there's longer lockdown October."" know people crossing vaccinated negative test required, afraid people believe vaccines badly behaved enough get fake documents. Well. fewer 'em. So, like 70 percent non Atlantan Georgians... care Covid causes erectile dysfunction sterility men, kills pregnant women? won't. else upper levels going rationalize spent whole lives pining corner office? need see egos. agree, point contact point shared group chat. Yeah agreed virus endemic. going away, least time soon. best option someone right vaccinated get COVID mild possibly risk hospitalization low possible. 

The vaccinations, less hospitalizations, vaccine efficacy high (for first 6 months shots) less virus spread. heard predictions US could start seeing 200,000 plus new infections every day. frustrating preventable part.

It preventable culture US. think much bottleneck US. strong arm (infrastructure, money, etc.) there, cultural character US allow getting good grip pandemic. Fauci Biden dropped mask mandate soon. Lets still give Fauci prize though maskless unvaccinated considered murderers? wondering think…. Herd immunity achieved. nothing Abbott wont ruin wonder first 2 shots spaced illicit longer better response. 

Also, know Pfizer moderna working variant booster. exactly companies booster, around corner would better give 3rd booster variant booster instead? political - economics. US economy suffering heavily COVID. government desperate correct soon possible. severely underestimated vaccine hesitancy well spread variants. 

Simply put, American corporations struggling, US rushed fix made worse tradition. ok GOP fine sacrificing old weak. Fully vacconated vaccination? 165,000 people come managed quarantine system far. Every case slips through. first one six months. lol  Well, life changed ,,Do everything home"", wont take this. vaccines quickly adapted New emerging strains, soon nivelul trataments disease, already saw UK live virus bare minimum restrictions vaccines. Terrible okay everyone. I'm sure Governor close administration access medical services. rest you? Meh. something time mean ethical issues. Doctors review boards seem care issues CEOs.   important thing try despair, even outlook less ideal. Believe me, feel you: taking strong precautions pretty much since pandemic started recently. got vaccinated (that's Europe young without risky comorbidities) return normal social activities necessary precautions situation merits moment.

Even ""extremely socially awkward"" human contact still vital good mental health, vaccinated encourage give up. We've already done avoid getting spreading virus, there's really much else do. propaganda bullsh7t girlfriends aunt died covid today. second Pfizer shot 2 months ago. weird loved one tells they're vaccinated mentally like ""cool good!"" 

then hits even harder good study also using PCR tests compare viral loads. tests capture inactive active virus. it’s possible immune response triggered vaccines lowering active load detected. Florida lots covid infections Guarantee it'll something entirely useless like ""get vaccinated happened"". jesus, shouldnt reproducing  masked up? yeah actually read too.

You've fallen victim narrowed vision. US, country huge numbers people vaccinated. even are, still case majority cases unvaccinated people, admission! thinking whole world, plenty countries hardly anyone vaccinated, countries access vaccines.

Their statement true. overwhleming majority covid-19 spread world among unvaccinated people. Vaccinating people first time would reduce spread much quickly giving boosters. latter without slowing former, great, let's both. latter actually slow former, bad can't ways: we're told constantly we're supposed care hospitalizations deaths. we're also told letting virus spread freely leads development variants. apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people count?

Here, bit confused. seeing lot messaging that's trying counter claims ""vaccines work"" vaccinated people still spread Delta (although lower probability). counter even Delta, vaccines still extremely effective hospitalization death, personal protection, getting vaccinated definitely works really really well.

But anyone told means *only* thing matters, wrong - maybe say explicitly interpreted way. main thing matters *for individual*. public health perspective, overall levels spread always mattered, I've never seen CDC say otherwise.

As ""apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people"", confused. ""freely"" mean? Vaccination significantly slows spread even Delta, level fully contained vaccination alone. course counts, point this: Getting unvaccinated people vaccinated first time, reduces spread lot giving vaccinated people boosters, know far. things reduce transmission, valuable, based current knowledge, getting people vaccinated first time slows spread lot more, giving boosters does. that's tradeoff they're talking about.

Your comment basically summarized I've saying now. 

People advocating vax passports instead negative rapid test realize recipe disaster. I’m still therapy 2020. 2022 months away I'm arguing vaccines. People misinformed believe vaccines cure regularly attack unvaccinated; reason replied poster first place. level lockdown guy probably wants China level, agian doesn’t matter COVID’s going away, massive animal reservoir, always come back lockdown over. That’s actually get ppl comply. SF lot fewer kids. Among adults, they're par  ""THE US"" monolith. European countries size states. States like Vermont beating EU countries. states like Louisiana original CDC PCR test documentation specifically mentioned looking three sequences ""highly conserved"" regions viral genome -- regions genome mutations often observed.  

These regions like areas bullet holes observed returning WWII bombers: ; (mutate|get hit), (virus|aircraft) usually survive (mutations|hits) areas.

You get unanimous verdict positive negative test result -- three present three absent.  IIRC samples consistently tested one two three sequences present reported CDC investigation.

The chance multiple mutations would near-simultaneously pop wild invalidate three target sequences low. Thank you, getting impression naught. We're losing 95% efficacy hospitalization 80-90%. Breakthrough infections possible still 40-60% effective that! That's still miracle. Boosters new targeted boosters help long term. Every little bit helps. totally agree actually. requiring negative test unvaccinated attend event, makes sense require vaccinated people well. comment mostly combat narrative existence asymptomatic cases reason get vaccinated. ??/ wanted people wear mask eating? new type mask allows this? timeline inline what’s reported. Basically 45-60 days out. Israel incredibly important case study Pfizer first potentially see waning antibodies. idea trying argue Israel incredibly important data point already bad places  11x likely survive covid vaccine without. need know.

The vaccine turns covid covid downplayers kept trying claim despite evidence contrary. lmao 90% adults vaccinated. \*MIGHT\* notion came  Ok article masking, vaccine mandates, restrictions continuing. way prevent that, like nowhere else world prevented it. health expert? Didn’t think so. Shutup. Sure let’s promote variants Definitely talk doctor. However, take prednisone daily doctor counting hours could vaccinated. Bye then. do!  go medical detector directly infringe constitutional rights. Mandating medical procedures does. Especially considering medical (gbs) religious reasons non-exempt.  Locking occasionally works. see Taiwan New Zealand. They've Virtually active spread detected eliminate it. islands likely we'll get zero vaccines slow thing enough quick measures including lockdowns eliminate spikes, flattening curves improving overall health outcomes. 

Why arguing vaccines?!? !remindme 127 days Serious question: ever seen virus level transmissibility *and* long asymptomatic dormant period? feels like we're really new territory here. Ah. Yes. disease vaccinate probably similar animals, put square thing square thing, press correct button, get object bottle etc  Go cold turkey ut helps quit good better sleep less anxiety  really wrong thing say. nothing like chicken pox far deadlier. I'm vaccinated want bigger person I'm relating comment hard   said he’s healthy likely think that's point. Realistically, spread Covid today preventable.

The adverse health effects minimized wherever possible. that's need take free vaccines. going anywhere. missed boat year ago.   CDC estimates 1.1 million people given booster shot pretending first shot. CDC announced people need boosters. real number probably much higher. Triage going common term media ICUs get worse. FIA Fluorescent Immunoassay. appear BinaxNOW uses technology. Whenever feel healthy enough work out. feel fine, go it. Even helps prevent spread infection. risk spreading still high enough would likely still lock down. Like see Israel, Iceland, Gibraltar.

You living fantasy stupid Republicans fault getting vaccine reality matter.  I’ve said I’ll say again: 

When mix science politics, get politics. Abortion isn’t really rejecting science tho. morally disagree believe fetuses already soul. 

You argue science suggests god, souls, etc. don’t exist science also cannot prove either. 

I’m pro-choice &amp; think it’s ridiculous religious fundamentalists take stance extremes it’s really rejecting science. Yep, stupid cards many levels, US unified system probably never one. 

I appreciate state level solutions mess. Imagine verify vaccination records people entering event, presented one dozen apps, cdc cards, state level paperwork 50 states. 

I'd assume point sort verified vaccination event largely vaccination theatre fake cards trivial duplicate, things also are. stands football games disastrous. Okay, makes sense 👍 Variants given letters become interesting enough. many variants watched granted Greek letters yet. TF sending school!? could used better metaphor.

Unless give everyone huge box self tests self-administer, it’s easy calculation make. Sturgis surges Unless affects personally, antivax/antimaskers care. already know this. unvaccinated Bears, baboons, tigers getting COVID vaccines zoos across U.S.
Here’s know experimental COVID-19 vaccine rolling zoo animals—and pets aren’t getting it.
Kern brown bear got COVID-19 vaccine July 21. ate whipped cream straight can.
Along vaccines, tigers got favorite meat—beef tenderloin—on shish kebab skewers, spritz goat milk mouths. siamangs—big black-furred gibbons—each got large marshmallow. baboons: gummy fruit snacks (peeled) hard-boiled egg.
At Oakland Zoo, California, 48 animals—including hyenas, chimpanzees, mountain lions—have received least one dose experimental COVID-19 vaccine made exclusively animals. Half already fully vaccinated. 
The Oakland Zoo among dozens zoos, research institutions, sanctuaries requested vaccines veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis. requests came wake news great apes San Diego Zoo became first zoo animals country receive vaccines; February, first reported National Geographic. 
“The story sparked interest many zoos, that’s led big donation plans,” says Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president global biologics Zoetis, developed vaccine. 
Those plans include fulfilling requests send 11,000 doses animal vaccine 80 institutions 27 states free. It’s promising development zoo animals, risk disease proximity humans. 
But much remains unknown. effective vaccines be? protect animals Delta variant? rollout complicated anti-vaxxers’ loud objections? pets ever need vaccinated? scientists institutions heart animal vaccine rollout hope find answers coming months.
Why vaccinate zoo animals?
Since early pandemic, zoo animals contracted virus. First, tigers lions Bronx Zoo April 2020; later, gorilla troop San Diego Zoo Safari Park. June 2021, two lions died zoo India testing positive COVID-19.

“We large spectrum animals care for, little poison dart frogs elephants,” says Alex Herman, vice president veterinary services Oakland Zoo.
Although Oakland Zoo hasn’t detected symptoms COVID-19 animals, “we knew animals risk,” Herman says. staff fully vaccinated, “we don’t know severe Delta be” risk transmission animals, says.
“This virus originated animals spread people, know spread back animals,” adds Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation wildlife health officer San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. addition wanting keep San Diego Zoo animals safe, “we wanted best interrupt [transmission] cycle prevent virus sticking around.”
Getting experimental vaccine zoos 
After dog tested positive virus Hong Kong February 2020—the first reported case domesticated animal—Zoetis began developing COVID-19 vaccine dogs cats. October 2020 pharmaceutical company confidence safe effective species. 
The experimental vaccine, Kumar says, works similarly Novavax vaccine humans, currently large-scale efficacy tests. Instead using mRNA (like Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines), viral vector (like Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine), live virus, uses synthetic spike proteins trigger antibodies live virus would. 
The vaccines distributed zoos experimental basis. U.S. Department Agriculture (USDA) considering commercial approval vaccines animals, exception mink fur farms outbreaks spread widely, Kumar says. 

Prior shipment, Zoetis must get case-by-case approval USDA state veterinarian zoo located. “There’s lot work,” says Kumar, overseeing 80 individual [zoo] agreements 80 individual requests USDA state veterinarians. far, Zoetis completed process 15 zoos sent 2,000 doses. 
The company received many requests zoos facilities internationally, added logistics navigating various countries’ regulations challenge, Kumar says. now, they’re focused U.S. zoos.
Deciding animals get vaccine
A year half pandemic, scientists still know little virus affects non-human animals. studies identified species may heightened risk. many cases, veterinary community must rely limited data sets, learning individual clinical cases sporadic outbreaks handful species. 
Both San Diego Zoo Oakland Zoo requested vaccines primates carnivorans—a group animals includes big cats, bears, hyenas, ferrets, mink, among others. animals known susceptible virus, aside deaths two lions India, majority big cats primates minor respiratory symptoms made full recoveries. 
At San Diego Zoo San Diego Zoo Safari Park, 266 animals received least one dose vaccine. None animals Oakland Zoo shown side effects, according Lamberski Herman.

Animal anti-vaxxers
After Oakland Zoo announced plans vaccinate animals, immediately faced backlash anti-vaxxers social media, phone, email. Anti-vaxxer Instagram influencers tens thousands followers helped amplify attacks. 
“It onslaught,” says Erin Harrison, vice president marketing communications Oakland Zoo. “Saying you’re poisoning animals, killing animals.” 
Many messages, filled misinformation, took fact vaccine legally defined experimental indication zoos conducting experiments animals. “Half said we’re going report PETA,” Harrison says. 
PETA, part, put statement support Oakland Zoo, noting, “These vaccines clinically tested administered animals deep consideration veterinary professionals. Since growing numbers big cats, apes, otters zoos contracting SARS-CoV-2—the virus causes COVID-19—from asymptomatic humans, evidence clearly indicates benefits vaccination susceptible species far outweigh dire risks infection unvaccinated animals.”
The Oakland San Diego zoos plan antibody testing vaccinated animals share results zoological community build database help determine vaccine’s efficacy various species.
Why zoo animals getting COVID-19 vaccines pet isn't
Although dogs cats tested positive COVID-19 smattering cases around world, Centers Disease Control Prevention World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) don’t recommend vaccinating pets, due relatively mild clinical signs lack evidence pets transmit virus humans. 
“It remains opinion need owners consider vaccinating pets SARS-CoV-2 time,” notes WSAVA April 29 report.

Between zoo visitors animal caretakers, chances zoo animal getting exposed virus higher, Zoetis’s Kumar says. compared lions tigers, “I wouldn’t say [domestic] cats less susceptible—just cat getting exposed people probably lot less.” 
Any request vaccinate cat dog would go process vaccine requests zoo animals, individual approval USDA state veterinarian. “You imagine got 100,000 requests cats dogs. it’s practical way us supply it,” says Kumar. 
Vaccinations cats dogs would depend government soliciting authorizing broad commercial use, says. USDA currently accepting applications animal COVID-19 vaccines mink, unless changes, Zoetis vaccine available species experimental, case-by-case basis. 
“The best way prevent [COVID-19] dogs cats let people become infected,” says Lappin. words, Kumar says pet owners, “vaccinate yourself.”

 poorly virus BEAST. So...unvaccinated people battle virus, like average person going ring Muhammed Ali. good odds....but still possible survive although many don't. Getting vaccinated means go ring brass knuckles gloves Muhammed Ali. still going fight hands...for lessor fight others still helluva fight. still perish, large chunk still get brutally pummeled survive, able knock Ali one lucky punch. See range possibilities happen vaccinated. wide range ...from death one end....to completely unfazed virus end, much higher percentage side range serious severe. Unvaccinated people range goes death one side feeling kind crummy....however, higher percentage people range leaning toward severe disease, hospitalization, death. Pharm.D here.

We can't. idea go letting bodies pile up. everyone would listen wear mask, vaccinated spreading unvaccinated. I'll take sniffle ventilator anyway. 

If anyone catching disease could chance vaccine, nobody blame yourself. Decisions consequences.

Get vaccinated wear mask, really want see die. fact many states making easy get tested also contributes dilemma. nonsense dealing last year.

Neither read article fully you? vaccination decreases severe infection death. Vaccine status therefore may considered making triage decisions part physician’s assessment individual’s likelihood said, “This move COVID-19 patient back line. one many factors may considered, want considered based upon somebody angry unvaccinated subconsciously. want considered objective basis.” basis is, likelihood survival? 

They're using vaccination status way inform likely survive. one factor many. complicated nuanced.

Read damn article get mad. think 90-95% herd immunity delta please quote that. Unfortunately, makes basically impossible unless children vaccinated Question. So,once become doctor, run room patients, do? start turning away patients walk in, look already have, start prioritizing way save people put situation? I'm genuinely curious. probably worst thing doctors need decide, happening now. need six months sobriety get yransplant. give liver someone os going destroy too.  one ads comes cable TV login car insurance ad back back 4 times. Yes around Thanksgiving  I'm speaking schools hybrid invited students come back. Many predicted schools would forced shut one saying denied care, get deprioritized behind vaccinated emergency health situations (ie heart attacks, car accidents, etc) think agreeing... said (emphasis vaccination personal choice (**and don’t think be!)**

What makes sense making vaccination personal choice restricting *everybody* make personal choice feasible.

We need mandate vaccine everyone wants anything public. crazy unsustainable. anyone would like see things going London look insta @billykeanemusic see situation pubs! Happy days  triage muthafuckas Really well said. You’re good doctor; thanks burning out.  got j&amp;j tested positive August 6th Yeah thankfully prove yet I'm sure long til happens. want everyone thinking I'm anti-vaxxer lol Going doctor months know triage means... hope work EC. Keep dangling carrot! Yeah also anticipate future variants might transmissable delta Dying go bangladesh sex someone prostitute poverty? Strings grasped.  Lmao say so. CDC added 799 deaths Florida’s cumulative total. one last month. One thing would help, direct infrastructure money building (much needed) rural hospitals. places across Florida panhandle 50-60 mile ride nearest hospital.

Here (Alabama), least, problem finding money build them. keeping open built. Rural hospitals already exist closing. say Pfizer drops Az, says ""more similar"" (i.e., much greater Astrazeneca). Virginia.   British expat ordered committed psychiatric hospital mask, covid fake, bullshit, Judge, hearing wearing mask train. family wrote Court also, saying become increasingly deranged throughout covid, worried af.

Singapore fuck around.

There American caned (sentenced 6 strokes, negotiated 4) vandalism 90s, yes. fuck around Singapore. That's IDF Figured much. lazy putting off. already happens medicine anyways, pandemic not. viruses eventually become semi-benign. 

That process is: humans highly susceptible likely die early, less likely procreate. humans innate resistance likely procreate dying. Repeat hundreds thousands generations humans, eventually virus tamed. 

Covid may mutate quickly solve herd immunity vaccination. 

It would hell lot quicker go New Zealand route burn infections zero iron lockdowns.    would contact place got it. got mine, example, county health department. Otherwise don’t know. gold, kept mine safe. Wait wait wait, form bullshit take anti-malaria drug crap?

Edit: don’t bother, you’re worth time. That's exactly saying ""we know"".  See state centralized vaccine website. long time since needed prove things current parents school children might familiar. guess schools/doctors/the state use websites days took get tested way home school yesterday staying home results. really beloved lot people! I'm fairly certain beaches start getting beautiful, west they're brown nasty looking. Delta kill people previous Winter, Delta *will* take valuable ICU space things ""returning normal"" thus stalling people need get ICU's non-Delta injuries/illness. could higher effect mortality cases whole. Normal healthy children usually range 97-100%. Infants range bit broad, 90-100%. 

You watch trends. at/about 96% hovering around 92%? downward trend concerning. sustained at/around 90-92% certainly it’s 90%, need supplemental oxygen. 

But oxygen saturation levels part clinical picture. respiratory rate? elevated? respirations look like, look labored? hear wheezing? get winded minimal activity? What’s heart rate? elevated? Etc.

[Vital Signs new record deaths? SF done well throughout pandemic, even vaccination went general population.  No, means hospitals dealing rsv covid time... 3rd shot might make pebis bigger, bobs heartier, give superpowers!!! said might! Thank that. needed reminded show compassion all—-even antivaxers point, triage, treat person likely survive. Yes, way, DeSantis’s donors profit Regeneron make money. tell us unvaccinated hospitals, subject story someone vaccinated got sick anyways. not, reading article something else add list try. appreciate thank linking this. I'm sure. think bigger problem made scientifically factually correct statement like using ""the data suggests..."" ""it possible..."" media ran twists headline generate clicks caused mass confusion. point, either control media publish CDC shuts up. case shutting up, media run go ""experts"" ""according Twitter post"".


I bet people even get CDC statements CDC media. Sarcasm aside, kiwis rare privilege able live life almost like pre-pandemic. know we've got we're terrified losing it, compliance rates incredible.

That said, person replying probably referring leadership Australia deadshits (NSW premier one) Hope feel better soon  plasma somewhat different monoclonal? Google, since I'm definitely doctor haha. ""
Convalescent plasma comes people donate plasma, monoclonal antibodies essentially made factory. big difference that every unit plasma little different, whereas monoclonal antibodies tend standard product every vial  get this, part hypocratic oath also minimizing harm.

When lack resources taken consideration like prioritizing ICU beds example, going want defer patient higher chance surviving.

The unfortunate reality typically means going vaccinated unvaccinated patient soo incredibly sad! heart goes kids caught here, unable get vaccinated whose parents let get vaccinated whatever is, pay price. schools things ventilate bring fresh air in, get better filters, maintain lower CO2 levels aren't. hope kids safe mask constantly, fingers crossed.  usual, Alabama Mississippi jockey last place every positive category. Hope u r well. sorry through. like toddler thinking close eyes can't see them. Yo, Cornhuskers, *can* see you- fuck think fooling? lifetime supply covfefe. $50 vaccine vs $1000+ monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy. could get antibody test interested.

Not antibodies actually neutralize virus, antibody tests able discern level neutralizing antibodies (need serious lab this), regular antibody tests can't tell still protected not. Also fun back napkin math get realistic Israel picture. 

According 2019 numbers 9,000,000 people Israel. far 69% total population vaccinated (78% 12+). far leaves 2,790,000 vulnerable.

There 962,193 infections Israel. make crazy assumption say unvaccinated, would leave 1,827,807 vulnerable Israelis. 

If 5,000 people Israel infected every single day next year, that’s long would take remaining vulnerable infected gain modicum immunity. 

Maybe it’s lack awareness large global populations days. hear 78% adults vaccinated Israel almost hear minds “that’s it, reached almost everybody, pandemic over”. even high rate country less 10m people, leaves LOT vulnerable people. I’m Africa did, follow suit mate. feel you. Musician life, never retire. I’ll die stage. praying ur downfall fr good luck [Death chart Florida weekly report CDC blank. are, pardon pun, swamped right now. least that’s charitable explanation.  Well much bet? should. plenty articles studies asked, part answered question:

* areas South Africa good public health policy, didn’t politicize things like wearing mask
* reason believe poorer countries didn’t testing capabilities deaths may reported
* younger age population whole, compared place Italy
* poorer slums, may stronger immune system becuase subjected pathogens daily basis
* live warmer climate outside more, especially poorer areas aren’t locking inside air conditioned buildings.

The list goes on, don’t suspect actually *care* answer. fact excess deaths thinking nearly 200K people dying virus “fine” seem really weird. Alright, clubs festivals still going 2? Months?  I'm spoiled live smaller county Texas (160k total residents), ER visits 5 hours total. live Scotland several place. UK level, foreign travel main restricted area. vaccine rate high? politicize virus? Trying control common (but serious) childhood colds masks seems like calls permanent masks children, think harm people realize. Temporary fine kids need see mouths facial expressions school amongst friends. 2nd shot. That's 8 months coming from. Good try though. Literally routine ICU patient would deprioritized vs. heart attack car accident victims Good. 

Jmo, right thing Dumb. dumb. This. know several people breakthrough cases received Pfizer first started distributed December. lines well Israel saying. I’m following point they’ve reliable source data far.  LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  I'm simply saying, looking article, listening speech, made belive vaccine almost 100% save death hospitalization. vaccines hugely hugely successful, that's true based metrics. fully understand done way get people vaccinate. there's fine line full honesty opinion. Seems like indication medical examiners slammed right don’t time reporting. Florida probably weeks behind deaths. Eventually, get added cumulative total. yeah, it’s good. 

If look recent weekly Florida covid CDC’s website, you’ll notice death chart page 7 blank. *94% adults still alive 💯 this, understand mind boggling me.

Maybe misinformation social media really powerful? Maybe slight misinformation that's pro vaccine well? e.g increases penis size causes weight loss absolute fuck wrong you. admire shit healthcare ""most powerful"" country face earth. Okay take away seriousness normal ERs wait 5 hours treatment broken bone? always like hospital considered pretty amazing. NZ basically become isolationist. really doable rest world.

I believe China's data (and barely believe rest OECD data), even within data eliminated it-- still cases. Despite basically full might one least free governments developed world, China still cases. worth tradeoff means giving essential individual liberties? so, free move China Mandarin speaker! 

There huge differences eliminating COVID polio/smallpox. Namely, fact COVID animal reservoirs. know nice fantasy, happening. Guys know Reddit last place personal senioritis shit mix. Struggling rn prayers appreciated. People think somehow test there's pandemic? Florida anecdotal reports people home testing positive reporting results. thinking tactic quite pervasive now. expert means sounds like mental health well-being might influencing many patients’ lack effort improve situations. wish great emphasis physical health. right attitude makes difference, experience.

I don’t believe people’s stubbornness selfishness simply spiteful contrarian. many seem unwilling trust expert advice tend interact people intellectually equal.

If I’m totally off-base feel free call (anyone), I’m less-educated tradesperson observes lot personalities line work. must specific state. Sure hell ain't 6k deaths. Yeah, watched shows side side almost certainly agree Maddow infinite amount Carlson (because I'm sure I'd ever agree anything Tucker said). trying mock making legal argument Maddow made silly foreboding scene, like 6 months? one get new card? process packing moving got mine done dumbass lost card. say miracles anymore, think I'd touch God,"" says Crowell.

Never mind doctors, nurses, technicians engineers made possible. country fucked. Texas fucked. Probably. underlying medical condition prevents getting vaccine likely mean they're less likely survive covid triaged lower. grim reality antivaxxers created. Facist? apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people count?

The virus would benefit mutated variant would allow vaccinated people asymptomatic, remain infectious longer period time spread new hosts. vaccinated people get booster, less likely happen. Hopefully don’t see another 25,000 - thankfully LA taking Covid pretty seriously Virus Economics 101: going ""open business"" slow spread virus. 13 percent people received full dose. think bit misleading article title hint vaccines current reason low March.  sure report soon consider anyibodies? Bc seems like disregarding already it. Yep. emergency appendectomy begged discharged hospital could take care got recovery room. neighbor much worse though. sepsis couldn’t even get bed. waited 17 hours looked at! He’s lucky survived. It’s awful us quarantined vaccinated *all things*, wind dealing consequences morons something happens that’s within control. people already lower chance survival ICU, regardless vaccine status. Good input interesting know things side ocean. hope improving health send wishes. Maybe, vaccines free available everywhere, yes, want low income people vaccinated well.  latest research indicates

The excess death counts America indicates 100s thousands potentially here

Hell coroners caught saying refuse report COVID deaths username checks out.  Spread word. Since say work clinic, assume healthcare worker, right? Would know people would allowed get boosters earlier 8 months recommended CDC? 

I ask CDC's 8 month recommendation 8 months seem actual basis data all, data Israel showing massive decline effectiveness around 5-6 month mark. I'm really worried Dad, 71 Parkinson's Diabetes 5 months second Pfizer dose. According Israel's data, protection infection could low 42% now, able get booster end November CDC's recommendation, feels like really long time Delta raging like is. Can't get third shot sooner? :( think people keep overlooking this. people told us are. Look response COVID. imagine worse situation danger dire outlook. Imagine they’ll treat then.

The unvaccinated, conspiracy spouting selfish maniacs die this, better we’ll be. would need large scale antibody tests large number states know. large scale 50 state antibody study released last September values ranged 23% New York State 0.1% Alaska. Given contagious Delta presumably another study done nearly over. It’s partially US’s fault denying aid beginning due sanctions. don’t even know temporarily lifted them. Shame us. already pace take OG Delta, mainly helped Mississippi states seems variant could possibly contagious OG Delta point. Charts information: Quote tweet thread (From July 24th):  epi-trends clear, number genomes AY.3 seem increasing faster Delta B.1.617.2 . could potentially due cluster testing also, surely needs epi data confirm.

It's another ""wait see"" seems pointing picking steam.   What’s sad you’re trying post things like articles virus written someone PhD Polymer Chemistry Engineering. medical doctor kind.  getting great medical facts don’t understand people agree statements. watched YouTubers got Covid didn’t get properly tested. One bad enough nurse friend give oxygen home. 

Seeing flippant get properly tested made realize Florida’s numbers much higher what’s actually reported. India alone accounts 17% entire human population. Many people need organs added waiting lists 'behavioral' issues - including untreated substance abuse disorder mental illness. Like ICU beds currently, donor organs short supply. allocated people appear likely manage health ways give transplant greatest chance success.  Bc ALMOST 100. Fucking idiots cant comprehend population 8b, 99.99 percent still = deaths. Yea remember story man dropping walking somewhere. speculated massive organ failure. 100% conspiracy theorists would called assassination covered labeled covid. also make travel you’re married American, anyone wondering saw downvoted. 

Do (the downvoters) seriously think fully vaccinated extremely ill person low survival chances get priority over, say, naive unsure unvaxxed 18 year old heavily influenced/brainwashed crazy parents trust, sick? woman trapped severely abusive relationship cannot escape whose husband threatens beat torture gets vaccinated (think extremists sure would this), also less sick incredibly ill fully vaxxed person? (Think hard would fully lie knowing caught might kill you... easy walk get vaxxed lie abuser's face hint lying might result beaten death).

There really complicated probably super rare situations people considering unvaxxed, think pretend exist, can't make absolute rules denying care based vaccination status alone. situation denying alcoholics liver transplants, last heard semi common naive young adults violently abused women convinced forced binge drink liver failure. cool Lol, data. need PR classes, need learn public health actually ( state labs could teach them). Crazy. would double total reported deaths worldwide far.  Ah yes, vaccine die, let’s get facist  Hello sir. banned questioning narrative. good day There's hardline refusing provide care, performing triage. 
 
In ideal world, triage never means someone receive life saving care. 
 
In real world, COVID one long Mass Casualty Incident. limited personnel resources. maximize effective use resources save many lives can. means prioritizing trauma patients vaccinated COVID patients increase turnover ICU beds, versus letting unvaccinated patient poor prognosis linger ventilator 3 weeks, least amount harm. 
 
I get wanting save everyone. can't. Wanting everyone get maximum care great trait physician normal circumstances - critical care physician midst MCI. technical expertise workers need could take two years complete education training. 

That seems speculative pessimistic. Countries like India making vaccines Covid non-RNA tech. USA scaled production RNA vaccines less year. rate we're going, shortages RNA vaccines many years. RNA vaccine tech applicable diseases Covid. sooner tech expertise transferred better, profit motive keeping happening. picture taken library, know sick husband would sick enough hospitalized. people seeking monoclonal treatment, apparently get without prescription referral Florida. says article.

Also, know patients admitted hospitals vaccinated still got sick. sick dying people unvaccinated. Hippies. going go Eugene... One more. Clinically, realistically, whatever u want say. covid cases mild. breakthru cases mild. 

Prevalence mild, moderate, severe COVID-19 cases
The latest research indicates vast majority COVID-19 cases fall least severe category:

Mild moderate: 81%
Severe: 14%
Critical: Absolutely.. headlines coming almost every state ICUs overrun, children hospitalized record rates, critical shortage staff facilities etc you’d expect wall wall coverage. really hope Texas secedes... Ahem.....Tik Toktor asked for, received albutetol inhaler covid February year. also good luck I’ve bronchitis past, covid felt lot like bronchitis me. Agreed 1000% whole point people sick they’re extremely symptomatic course high viral argument isn’t correct data showing vaccinated people test positive don’t symptoms mild symptoms.

That contradict point. ""Testing positive"" also mean *low* vaccinated people get covid don’t severe symptoms.

Correct, **AND** [viral-loads results suggested among people testing positive, vaccinated **had lower viral load** average unvaccinated people. Paul Elliott, epidemiologist Imperial, says results differ Ct studies study sampled population **at random** included people tested positive without showing symptoms. follow examples work social life need office it.  Exactly. sister put heart transplant list likely survive surgery. Anyone experienced anxiety future, regardless personal vaccination status, think consequences illness large percentage population. vaccinated, also recognize disease leave many maimed, many dead. war we've fought.

I know near future, even. effects anti-vaxx opinions also place strain society economy long-term, thinking effects epistemological breakdown.

Yeah, I'm anxious it. young children too, think of, watching society march despite death unnerving. Super anecdotal. u really going say breakthru cases arent mild? cases unvaxxed mild! Sorry. truth. cite NIH. Though pretty fucking common knowledge now.   Well … yes? actually controversial given many people could killed? ""But need is, modulate fears protect without driving crazy, need manage expectations life going look like virus better control."" 
 
What kind expectations referring to? Masks social distancing forever? going tell truth breakthrough cases aren’t “rare” hoping meant people cared enough health everybody else's get vaccinated get bed everybody else, minus kids, park hallway. Seriously, flow information confusing start, ""masks ineffective"" ""vaccinated wear masks"". war ba sing se kids school Texas confirm indeed losing mind. What? not? protect kid send everyone home? unvaxxed willing get monoclonal antibody treatment? Surely must afraid nefarious ingredients contained within... 

Who knows much autism magnetism microchips one might get IV infusion? /s restaurant maybe, hospital. access correct answer.  Logically, yes course. sad we've come point, urge people remember unvaccinated people too. I'm vaccinated nurse enough lot things past year, want others losing humanity already. situation lose-lose, reality. sad I'm lamenting.  High school. gonna get worse sounds significant  turns vaccinated either, goes line said above. always overly religious conservative folks.  I’m thinking means vaccinated person car accident needing ICU would get last ICU bed even unvaccinated covid patient needs it. February 2020 sickest I've far ever remember. Terrible fever bad whole bed soaked felt like hallucinating. ""better"" really vicious dry cough go away. 

At time knew little Covid outside basic symptoms called one hotlines find something / quarantine / know what. way could get tested like 1 3 hospitals nearby. wife talked kinda came away decision Covid probably putting serious risk getting going didn't. 

I never got antibody tests I've always wondered could Covid not. college high school student? senioritis times lol. It’s ironic, problem going posts downvoting (like one hi!) required show id, refuse you, ask contact information least name refuse present Id, records, keep track well, that's easily looked up, no, I'm making things up. legal give contact information, reason, prove vaccinated. new stuff.  Obviously doctors would take consideration--as immunocompromised people increased risk regardless. sorry experience, glad made through. Hope you’re better now. started booster drive last week, knows even time response third build people? Two three hospitalized immunocompromised, well, depending, vaccines may little none them, regardless time.

Nevertheless, nice get Delta-tailored booster running time something worse comes along. kind owned they're talking way Secret Service waited Trump laying floor moaning took hospital. really surprised states banning mask mandates (the bare minimum prevention measure) shutting economy prevent spread coronavirus?  Yup. Michael completely utterly destroyed ruined rental prices. housing market PCB disaster.  1 ecmo, two patients need one. exactly prognosis 1 vaccinated hasn’t. make call?

Hypothetical? Let’s hope emergency planning emergencies According article even info, crap article Lol shit article jesus Recently got sick even though I'm vaccinated. Tested positive covid. lethargy sore throat, fever, chills, headache. vaccinated J&amp;J May Singapore, huh? tourist get actually physically whipped sentence spitting chewed gum sidewalk there? Can't wait see they'll fake vax card holders! normal circumstances, I’d agree you. people openly invite misfortune upon themselves, reap sow. don’t trust medical science keep getting COVID, suddenly trust cure them? mom always said “If you’re gonna dumb, gotta tough.”  vaccinated cases mild…  meaning teens mid 30's  What’s point CIA anymore. keep putting money it? started giving boosters; infections happen that? Sorry you’re feeling well. Maybe go get tested? Texans must sick tired whiplash point. would losing mind lived there.  Lol Thank presenting this. I'm extrapolating Covid mutation always mild cases amongst vaccinated/natural immunity population ad nauseum, rarely deaths, eventually leading virus ranging symptoms somewhat likes influenza common cold. might even say thing vaccines viral mutations. Maybe NONE matters everyone needs chill fuck article somewhat contradicts title.

""It immediately clear whether 14 contracted virus receiving booster.""    someone refuses stop smoking sticking particular diet conditions, put list life saving organ transplant.

This almost ridiculous untrue lol. 

These exact people get organ transplants lol. That’s great hear. [covidestim says Texas currently local maximum (i.e. currently appears peak, knows future holds). would guessed well, thanks! PLENTY people didn’t get vaxxed, got Covid, DIDNT need go hospital.  funny, thats exactly felt travelled UK back early December shit kicked wave earlier year.  Yes, medicine.

Triage always part medicine.

If someone refuses stop smoking sticking particular diet conditions, put list life saving organ transplant.

If shortage drugs, goes history actually taking time doctor's requirements.

There many examples.  It’s pretty much true though. wear mask shops case makes someone else feel comfortable.
The one thing fear new variant vaccine proof meantime let’s crack on.  Good. Bitches Crazy?!?!  Stay safe!! also, escaped lab wild bats, jump bats 

Because that's absolutely preposterous ridiculous proposal, least SARS2 immediately come bat kind. likely run across sampling bats coronaviruses.

It clear hypothesis gaps concocting absolutely implausible scenarios. Roger Wicker mask mandates.

I wonder plague carrier? isn’t situation. treat syphilis guy doesn’t mean guy doesn’t get treated. there’s one ventilator two people come suffering similarly covid go vaccinated outlook things bleak point. Good luck you. seems like really nice person. hope make long time ideals get crushed. thought stuff like happened Russia Dude pulling numbers LOL Seems like lot cases many people vaxxed. Please stop lying. made exceptionally clear believe jobs exist social life. finally thrown jail? (I know. It’s rhetorical…) Yeah, town like 77% fully vaccinated. I've shopping inside stores again. vaccine everything delivered. people still wear masks, extra comfort. Although, came back shopping heard someone sneeze side store. feel like sneezing inside store today like yelling bomb. Lol.

I also went camping friends last week. little water park kids outside felt comfortable using it. already contracted Covid recovered? ASCENDED final form! Even infected vaccinated person contagious, un-infected vaccinated person much less likely get infected first place, right?

So isn’t herd immunity still possible vaccinated people slowing spread simply catching first place?  consider far enough ""escaped"" fit criteria? looking exactly sort scenario delta right now? Pfizer vaccine went efficacy 95% 42% delta. Yes last sentence specifically. one disease ever single handedly overrun medical resources like covid. Generally speaking, typical times hospitals ability treat everyone regardless whether innocent complicit landing there. typical times unfortunately it’s time group responsible (the willfully unvaccinated) held accountable.

Edit: one disease modern times*  watch Israel closely. fucking around. Much honest messaging . guess took lot things granted huh? always complained there’s much ppl. Turns it’s everyone make things fun it’s 2/10ths one percent. highest percentage stock Facebook cares? I’ll get one week they’ll give me. know people lose minds shocking idea could need two shots month apart this, it’s reactionary outrage sake outraged. 

After kids get vaccines, that’s it. hope people interact least got first two dose regimen beyond like flu shot me. get religiously every year, becomes that’s fine me; don’t get it’s recommended, think you’re stupid it’s much business.

Walensky isn’t saying anything controversial crazy here. agree learned media going latch onto anything turn headline. continue living without seeing die? Yes. essential? No. 

Will die anyway without seeing them? Yes. seeing first change fact? No.

Like said, important essential.

You like true. Teddy Munster. Well, accomplished reduction tourist revenue. even already got recovered expected get vaccine??

It would really cool could quit cult this. Exactly triage emergencies requires prioritizing survival. vaccinated patients better chance recovery get priority scarce resources. difficult choices made places like northern Italy NYC start pandemic. ""healthcare""  Pfizer putting hit CDC director. Cutting pharmaceutical companies future profits like that. bad medicine basic triage.

That's absolutely basic triage. headline suggesting vaccinated lose priority. Practically, nobody flow analysis individual room even hospital, much less classroom store, way knowing air filtered without plastic barriers. lot variation room design (intake vent cornder, center, outside room, etc.) hard imagine kind study huge error bars effect ""desk shields"".

I think plastic barriers could trap viral particles interfere getting filtered out. could counters, desks, checkout lines, food freezers, couches, etc. Especially, ""shorter humans"", like kids. kind 12 can't vaccinated yet.

The plexiglass barriers keep certain physical distance people, people momentarily lean transmit sound well. Mad Pub ! little, late. Unfortunately media spin saying ""I virus humbling, don’t want say never, necessarily anticipating need annually,  Immunocompromised people used shots booster shots already. get current flu vaccine every year, plus pneumonia vaccine longer intervals (been 4 years think now). covid vaccine boosters different, lot easier done doctor packed crisis vaccination centre!

Right I'm compromised usual I'm going chemo late December. Rules cancer ward ""Wear mask around others family close trusted people, go big concerts stuff like that, go work (I work children public library) make family careful can, too."" Hardly anybody part Norway wear masks now, got funny looks hair fell - Cancer Look get it. really need scrap current healthcare payment system. making health care administrators wealthy wasting many government private dollars. totally get you’re saying don’t think anyone saying anti-Vaxers *denied* care, there’s enough resources treat everyone, people chose vaccine prioritised chose to. Negative tests stronger evidence person going infect others Pfizer example possibly less 50 percent efficacy Delta, tons infected vaccinated people. Kids six school age kids.  Good you. jobs exist social life. 400 17’s vaccinated one evening walk clinic sister volunteered week. Monday. tried say month ago, mass downvotes, lol. DELTA infected everyone burned ran victims. happened India. MUCH infectious dangerous means masses natural immunities help fight subsequent infections. Wuhan never number deaths states right now. ... bad medicine basic triage.

No doctor wants decide treat comes point there's option needs guidelines making decisions.

Italy ran problem early pandemic generally speaking patients highest likelihood recovering longest life expectancy prioritized.

Having vaccines available adds one metric consider. Democracy free speech proven nothing weaknesses. reason China overtakes us. nothing Euros schools that. Farr's Law epidemics: cases rise fall rate, shape bell fully go Israel’s data… said Pfizer vax losing steam, ears perked up. feel like US hedge hard bad news. Thanks GOP ruining economy.

Again Time steal DVD players propose city council change name NYPD New York Sissyboys fully comply public health orders. u get sick 3rd shot like 2nd shot? enough infections able real-world vaccine efficacy Pfizer (42!!!!) Moderna (56!)  need live rest life like this. Covid forever. 

Also, vaccinated people shorter period transmissibility unvaccinated people, reducing number people infect.  It’s called healthcare capitalism. rich powerful Americans get best treatment afford best care. rest us option go bankrupt deal 20% copay $100,000, $250,000 $500,000 hospital bill survive! accomplished ammo needs win gop nomination 2024. vaccinated people still distance loved ones?

I'm gonna say it, really care antivaxxer gets sick decided hang friends, went see movie. I'm gonna held hostage lunatics anymore. Well course one means people aren’t allowed get vaccine. We’re talking people could get choose to. Fuck people.  Thank much well written answer. state laws regarding vaccine extremely easy do

Already done, confirmed liar. Send link prove require give personal address dumb mfer.

🤣 something never asked for. asked state claimed vaccinating kids, done everything possible avoid providing full s**t Currently eligible =/= struggling get vaccinated. Important mention vaccinated people covid antibodies. Kinda point vaccine. 94% figure includes vaccinated people, people it, active infections, indicative active infections. accuracy reporting pretty... Loose. Countries banning flights in/out countries. Also restrictions included, curfew, shelter place, etc. MIGHT not? … also might? Hey, super helpful. Next week they’ll tell us MIGHT stick dicks vacuum cleaners avoid catching shingles. Maybe back add context though. “subject” story man taking photo, person picture. man vaccinated breakthrough case went get recommended free treatment hospitals currently overwhelmed area (Jacksonville). symptoms mild. start showing severe symptoms, treatment doesn’t help. That’s take before. 

Breakthrough cases happen, always look reported numbers. Oregon, example, seeing roughly 7% vaccinated hospitalizations less 1% vaccinated deaths. vaccinated people serious illnesses issues. trend repeated states well. vaccinated person still still much less likely infected. shorter mild illness. 

Is rare? Probably best word use. it’s relative. 

Here Ontario, Canada reporting details daily unvaccinated make 70-80% daily cases, despite 25 % population. That’s good point…thank you. last year. words last listen. original point age say that. said people Medicare struggling get vaccinated. “Blessed patient vaccine counselors, bearing unvaccinated change heart “

-FSM 1:4 Ultimately, vaccine affects chance survival COVID. simply part patient's medical history factored triage process. position rationing ICU beds, vents, etc., prioritize patients higher chance survival. case COVID patients, means prioritizing vaccinated patients, vaccine improves chances. factor, absolutely factor.  Define “worldwide lockdown”  sound insensitive, pictures like going do? people lying floor. Like took benadryl today allergies wait line, I'd lying floor too, I'm fine.

Don't get wrong. WISH something would get people. pictures people napping generic commercial carpet gonna it. knows. earth knows. unpredictable. August 18th, 2020 47,000 daily cases America.

Face shields alone don’t work though, you’re right. does, people need use them. get hospital they'll deny ever covid nurses doctors caused problem, walking lollipop mouths Even worse news: damage abbot lies told, universities schools pretty much FORCING in-person attendance DESPITE extreme transmission. Universities worst right , charging kids rent fees. forcing attendance, saying “ university allowing hybrid delivery option concerned” 

Somebody help schools university students it’s gettin bad.  point still stands, kids need vaccines. stopping benefits people might sound like good idea first, sad truth might increase vaccination rates much instead lead lot uninsured people continue use medical resources, ERs treat uninsured law, higher death rates.   I’m terrified elderly parents emergency unvaxed plague rat occupying bed could have. conference center library that's used clinic. library open public moment. I’m guessing you’re age 12. Person replied said stop Medicaid payment aren’t vaccinated. large portion people losing Medicaid would children ineligible vaccine. drugs helping you?   People encouraged lateral flow test twice week think many bothering unless job etc.

We are?? That’s first I’ve heard wonder seems like many people child free person … really isn’t. find original Reddit post r/pics, think? husband vaccinated showing symptoms, went go get treatment like told hospitals space. 

You need positive test get treatment it’s free sites. Otherwise need referral. Unfortunately like 6 sites whole state, also overrun desperate. Yeah challenge average Joe speaking speak scientific medical jargon, saying stuff like “no evidence”, “it possible”, etc specific connotations. 

For example, telling someone “there conclusive evidence drinking grape soda doesn’t cause cancer” implied subtext danger, medically scientifically speaking true neutral. 

I still feel CDC needs get better PR sensitive media average person reacts statements. fair still getting sick dying? : ( Good, happen, deny modern health science, get sick something preventable, get denied modern healthcare Sadly, [it's happened last week name Joel Valdez. Google name get dozens articles  oh like Monoclonal antibodies therapy around decades illnesses. It’s thing vaccination. Vaccination stimulates body make antibodies. direct injection antibodies. Every unvaccinated patient covid point deserve medical care. hope count every single unnecessary unvaccinated death. Fascinating.  Nope happened Houston last week person replied suggested Medicare/Medicaid pay healthcare recipients aren’t vaccinated. lot children Medicaid eligible vaccine yet. understanding they're able take scared get shot makes sense whatsoever? anything probably stuff original vaccine. Read again.  Yes, great idea! ? im medicaid 0 issues getting it, free regardless matters cause even though I’m vaccinated I’m apparently still able pass along others much viral load someone hasn’t even damn shot. There’s also people getting long Covid vaccinated too. yeah, kinda matter isn’t rare we’re told. No, science bro, can’t go disrespecting bro without saying something Yep, mentioned earlier comment, know guy died due able stay sober I’m sorry go that. hospitals vaccinated children point. (Unless *legitimate* reason one.) need positive Covid test. Here’s thing though: average wait test like week areas, takes 3-4 days get result after. 

Libraries actually make lot sense public health stuff like this. usually ample public transport access, AC, space. use warming cooling shelters needed well. It’s really hard convert needed. think it. get booster available you. shot arm better shot sitting refrigerator. helping humanity everything stop disease vector. Pfizer alone planning hit 3 billion doses 2021 delay (especially live place low vaccination rates vaccines expiring thrown away!). Couldn’t lie vaccination status? I’d imagine testing antibodies may take longer simple covid test they’d already admitted. might want check platforms running governor right now. go home covid kill daddy, grandma? 

Also many people ignore potential long-term effects? suspect can't really understand personally impacted long-term effects viruses bacteria, pretty terrible even adults got live half lives first without long-term effects sickness.

I wonder anti-maskers ever moments reflections ask angry willing treat fellow humans poorly want protect people wearing masks. anti-mask parents think school administrators trying people wear masks next decade? whine complain children.  vaccine info available state’s department health website. don’t know live, think that’s probably good place start. call city/county department health. point right direction. Like episode Scrubs alcoholic set recieve liver transplant (I think sober point) surgery neared somehow let slip docs glass champagne daughter's wedding denied transplant. Forgive got details wrong, always wondered situations like come real life. Yeah. Might want edit one. It’s easier say “we don’t know yet don’t want speculate” proverbial PR handbook says handle kinds situations. Otherwise media exactly it’s now, cherry pick pieces statement turn headline. currently one cannot receive vaccine due medical condition acutely ill (e.g. viral illness, pneumonia, treated hospital already). 

The CDC otherwise recommends vaccine EVERYONE age 11 (12 above). includes pregnant women surprisingly even history GBS.    got one last year great! use see asthma weird things start coughing. also use feel like i'm coming something. Peace mind dude.  “headlines recycled 2020” bingo￼ Might totally wrong, thought Israeli study 5-6 months antibodies started waining. think question sooner, especially given availability right now. feeling sub seems choosing 8 months logistical reasons (and maybe allow time currently unvaccinated get it), medical reasons.

Republican nursing homes:

Meanwhile:[children’s hospital Colorado experiences 60% increase Santis promoting Regenron actual vaccines. Yeah, fuck journalists getting paid, right? Say's who? 

Vaccines infallible. Even vaccinated get infected lungs. 

That breakthrough infection are.   read article mRNA vaccines start stronger less long term efficacy (be due less antibodies variants) , thus need booster already. Remember, shortcut.  Despite making 14% population probably accident due stuck appliance like washing machine dryer. exactly they’re designed do, keep surgeon’s spit droplets spraying someone’s open chest. Surgical masks designed protect surgeon patient airborne virus. Surgical masks let air rush right around side them. doctor visiting covid ward better surgical mask on. Let people don’t get vaccinated sign receive zero icu care worst case event. Done thinking someone gets hit $500 bill go pick medication get message pretty quick vaccination rates shoot up.

The government limited levers pull get people go get vaccinated hitting wallet bring home personally.

I support letting people die resources available save moment lot people dying non covid things ICU's full unvaccinated covid patients.

People right thing getting vaccinated left die delusional selfish idiots taking resources. Yeah sister take immunosuppressants live. dangerous time. New Zealand us (no covid) went back Australia. right like CDC know year. either want care health misinformation spreading Vaccines available worries you. need getting upset though! YOLO!! Excellent. Downvoted truth. sub hates good news hates extremes necessary damage control. COVID December, first week felt like bad head cold got worst, mild case. it’s like WA, I’m assuming probably be, it’s public, private, charter schools. I'm surprised insurance companies live evil selves now, charing sliding scale people depending vaxx status. 2nd shot 10$.1st shot 20$.no shot 34,543$ per day. hate stupid people Triage protocol usually save highest likelihood survival, divides people 3 buckets. probably survive without care (highest chance surviving overall), probably survive care, probably die even care. exact boundaries three flexible point focusing middle group save many lives possible focusing people make greatest difference odds survival. People highest chance surviving told tough home. Nice. didn’t know rolling boosters already. Well done.  florida archdiocese churches openly yet?  turn away perfectly good schadenfreude? lemmings thing, there's stopping nature lol old you? definition triage. lot anti vaxers assume supply limit medical care…it lot different without safety net. Okay understood wrong. thought saying people weren’t getting free. 

I went vaccine event, showed card, checked immune compromised. Gee. wonder group people downvoted information. antivaxxers die, (or already have) infected multiple times over, less less symptoms time. exact details long-term natural immunity debate, endlessly reinfected every 4 6 months one time gets best them?  bodies get good fighting longer asymptomatic reservoirs? Still either vaccinate children let covid ping pong Yup called triage two mains schools thought 1) treat sickest first 2) treat best chance survival first. first come first serve that's lazy. That's point. point governor forbidding steps protect public transmission funded company provides treatment. knowingly increasing transmission rates donors profit treatments. honestly think surgical masks would still used surgery nothing? fully vaccinated get breakthrough case, I’m curious means protection?  Im sure live live insurance take account lifestyle choices. choose cover things based choices. could say that, could look caseload hospitals Texas Florida, vrs states higher vaccination rates, make decision there.... mean, matter pays it? bribed politician play vaccine endorse alternative would worth looking into. mean saying is, saying worth looking into. talking denying care heck it, discussing triage. 2 patients need ICU bed one bed available choice needs made. According decades long principles triage, treat person likely survive. patients similar medical history one vaccinated, vaccinated one statistically likely survive therefore get priority. 2 beds available patients get treatment.

If individuals choose make decisions lower chances survival outraged doctors take information account triage situation. got back 5 days ago 10 day vacation/trip see family Ghana. amazing. Whether I'm dealing Covid US, somewhere else, matter?  I'm fully vaxxed, masked, took required PCR tests before, trip, negative. 

As aside, also got Yellow Fever vax trip, already gotten typhoid within last 5 years trip Zambia 2017.

I feel like new normal, unfortunately, done life hold. want travel, follow required guidelines. Seems agree studied thus far US. That's everyone masks - vaccinated not. think actual triage guideline North Texas hospitals, reported news, opinion. Thanks insight! try patient. Unfortunately live GA, approach COVID IDGAF stressed it.  best vaccines developing countries necessarily mRNA vaccines. Focusing vaccines need little refrigeration would far wider reach globally. 

The US able scale production mRNA vaccines actually facilities produce people technical expertise. US working mRNA technology one fashion another last 30 years. wasn’t country able create something nothing US gave resources existing system.

I believe it’s non-RNA vaccines probably easy scale up. However single mistake manufacturing process could cost public’s trust. Facilities expanded multiple countries vaccines many different types made. think viral vector, protein subunit, whole virus vaccines hold promise rapid expansion. course much depends existing facilities supply chains. Same! awful . guess need couple child deaths make change minds. infuriating every step pandemic bungled certain subset people. possible virus isn’t duplicating lungs you’re vaccinated? It’s absolutely ridiculous. emailed child’s school principal superintendent. urged please reconsider notifying parents. told small child home chronic lung condition least, notification help keep distance school aged child 2 year old. brought fact notify us lice. told per lawyers advice, aren’t going notify us. privacy staff important them. 

I know it’s dramatic literally cried. disagree. There's number vaccinated anti-maskers.  It’s also kinda fucked demand scientists get everything right first time rather giving credit update previous notions they’re presented new data.

The vaxx protect getting worst COVID want pass onto someone else.

You still go drive sit backyard mask on, interact ppl case carrier. Get tested 2 weeks prudent. GOP literally trying kill people point anyone vaccinated without valid reason (immunocompromised, etc.) admitted hospital. I'll getting booster right around Christmas too. US- It! reached 70% vaccination, oh never mind it’s 90% Forever? catastrophising? 

ICU beds full larger swaths country. end goal? Better US, bar somewhere around sea floor. one population Jamaica Oh, sure, *now* believe medical science. asking lots questions what's it? amazing news 11 brothels. That's uh..... Low sure hope does... anyone familiar triage formulas speak would weigh situation else besides vaccine status equal two people one bed available?

In particular, likelihood survival treatment weighted heavily likelihood death without treatment?

Where might look related stats (if anything like even exist)? Well. new story I'll hearing anti-vaxxers work. Awesome.... [It looks like Louisiana past Rt lowest ever number infections dropping dramatically. I'm seeing peak near peak trends places hit hardest first well. idiotic mindset. pandemic impacts tons people across nations. That's called pandemic. 

It's like saying climate change me.   hey didn’t reverse decision, said everyone wear masks, CDC said Thank love state.  Fortunately unfortunately depending look it, delta variant seems rip areas quickly.  devastating going seems subside pretty fast. 

I'm saying good thing. seems pattern. Happened India England. remember countries numbers roof stopped.  

Not doctor looking patterns.  

I could totally wrong. point virus passed inhaling respiratory system. Since still high number unvaccinated individuals, infections allowed greater chance even worse variants. way stop current surge wear masks since even getting vaccinated right means fully vaccinated 6 weeks.

 guess alternative allow continue killing people last ones standing mostly immune. Wait... definition ""essential travel"" means travel somewhere ""save life""? it? Hahahahhahaha Saw article awhile back source, remember correctly proportional replication rate virus inverse size genome. think Covid something like half replication rate flu double genome, significant mutation rate would around 1/4th flu. That's originally thought one vaccine would good would worry much strains. 1/4th flu mutation still plenty spreading around globe like wildfire apparently.

Boosting months give secondary immune response common vaccines— hepatitis B, polio, others. mean, get science adapts. thought odd CDC didn’t least consider possibility cases going removing masks, least wait data delta (which exist time) concerning variant. Makes wonder anything CDC says legitimate it’s political. Based what? Every tracker I’ve looked Alabama still trending upward.  refuting point made mRNA vaccines ""rushed""
Then claimed Az vaccine like traditional vaccine not.
AZ vaccine new went exact trial process Moderna, Pfizer. 

I trying get point across 

Both viral vectors mRNA vaccines next generation vaccines. 
Both easily thier genetic instructions altered develop vaccines diseases. 

Both thing.
The get cells make viral proteins.

Through slightly different mechanisms.  fucking tool. Non Well played ignoring long took admit virus airborne, making recommendation six feet pointless.

It's really defense reason thought incredibly dumb, thanks tuberculosis related mix point, every public health professional world assumed droplets larger 5 micrometers rapidly fall ground contaminate surfaces. Hence basically virus considered airborne. true it'd basically impossible droplets get sick directly. problem true droplets ~100 micrometers stay air hours. one said wouldn’t. Fauci said wasn’t data needed one yet. new data coming almost every day. weight evidence became booster would beneficial. vaccines came scientists assumed would need booster point observation time would needed see when. New virus, new disease, new vaccine- many unknowns. That’s vaccine cards two extra lines people told laminate cards. Whaaa? cite source I’m NY got note kids school once. Yep.

From article Aug. 10, CDC changed way reported new cases deaths Florida. Cases deaths used logged total new cases reported single day. Now, Florida reporting cases “case date,” according CDC rather date case logged system. result change lag cases date significant number cases backfilling time.

Our reporting methods changed repeatedly. Anything obfuscate direness situation. time, yes was. great thing science learns time goes on. people want use negative, need think they're promoting- scientist learn adapt. prefer tell truth best information have, leave politics selfish agendas politicians want use personal gain. wish data contagiousness asymptomatic vaxxed people. wish vaccines could reduce asymptomatic contagiousness phase much possible, know that's realistic.  remember collapsing people videos. wonder we're seeing now. been. lot virologists (most PHD lol) say thing actually. TWIV one favorites type info - general fear mongering media. It’s like I’m reading article third world country can’t anything else except lock people indefinitely. reverse might imply that, order implies people worried spike cases getting vaccinated previously hesitant. think people afraid vaccine hoping enough people would take confer herd immunity without taking personal risk side effects. many people getting sick again, vaccine side effects look scary comparatively speaking.    doesn’t really make financial sense though It’s mind boggling. There's date. know image data sometime 2021 least 6700 people vaccinated. wonder whether mild infection vaccination would effect booster? weren’t wearing live either. time wasn’t public knowledge difference needed distancing outside, since we’re densely populated area (though level NYC) people wearing outside. cops. one day road work construction crew (who usually kind bandanas least) two cops standing redirecting traffic, DUST FLYING EVERYWHERE. Nope, reason wear mask here. gotta know I’m voting Trump. someone decided get one shot instead two Moderna Pfizer, open receiving booster shot, eligible?

I ask read mentions people get booster shot 8 months SECOND shot. Yeah wasn’t. huge mistake politely let it. 200 days lockdown areas. That's enough make crazy. That’s kicker. wasn’t vaccinated. Biiiig mistake. That's true. also pay survive. Yes. It’s called outercourse employment… happens virus runs rampant. People dead streets.  also science based tell vaccinated people take masks couple months ago? Many high risk people still taking precautions back normal life. People stupid.

So instead taking vaccine prevent severe illness that:

1) costs public $40 doses 

2) studied *exceptionally* large number people and

3) gives durable cross-reactive resistance virus future variants future

These people decide to:

1) forego vaccine get super sick

2) take monoclonals cost public $1,500 per dose, which...

3) studied fraction people compared vaccines

4) continue audacity say big monied interests behind push vaccines and...

5) still statistically worse chance recovery higher chance Long COVID let disease progress  say Beach Boy diet? know Sharon. Use Incógnito 4? data used study show likely fully vaccinated person Delta variant pass infection another individual, compared unvaccinated individual virus. high viral loads found study strong indicator risks transmission vaccinated unvaccinated people Delta variant could similar.

Isn't possible reduced symptoms, things like coughing less end reducing transmission?

(This question. I'm position make statement like this) would reduce capacity Really? thought offered free vaccine. Yep. prove yet Beshear stated today 19-20 flu season KY 29k+ cases flu. 20-21, 150 cases. no,.masks work. Buckle there’s going more. I’ve accepted species don’t plan prioritize lives face climate change it’s effects like increased pandemics. I’m negative, stoically accepting realization came many recent deaths. smaller scale, individuals like doctors others still trying save lives least, now. people supposed protecting us? dumb. dumb. hopeful.  hope get this. want life back. Whatever life maybe want back. moment time hopefully drop bucket rest lives.  Let's to, get move on. don’t think people think means there’s pandemic. don’t see point. dad tested positive last week breakthrough infection. home didn’t report it. told work said come x amount days

He’s fine thankfully. Felt like cold 3 days so. Get vaccinated people Paywall Also, username never checked more.  could also say gravity isn’t thing try jumping cliffs. Yeah don’t know. I’m hard time optimistic days myself. third shot pose new issues?
Nobody tested third shot yet?
They assume, science it, wont cause issues?

Also, remember read this, someone said seeing reports something like 30 deaths actually like 100+ higher. don’t disagree, delta spreading efficacy vaccines waning enough 8 months suggest boosters, country going put populace risk. 

Knowing know, really need boost production support efforts. almost smell grift. thinks equity US? would want anyone else? reported properly credible sites, sans facebook clickbaits, ppl dont comprehend properly. ppl susceptible pre vax still vulnerable vax. Ppl also denial vulnerabilities. see many overweight obese ppl unvaxed bc say arent risk. delusional consulting doctors science. facts unchanged past year ppl still dont understand probabilities. didnt pre vax either. didnt understand 3% fatality meant millions would die, might them, esp XYZ. Really disinfo rampant, wouldnt exist without lack comprehension follow.  already know worn N95, that's worn family.

Is good faith say ""Perhaps one reason resume makes look overqualified"" one even apply jobs? Yes no? spouse told would think actually applied jobs, apply would feel good statement? Moral issues aside, get vaccinated, never free COVID.

Getting developing countries vaccinated matter self interest. People getting 3rd already though. volunteers got vaxxed public? Shouldnt past 3rd shot now? Oregonian, teacher, let's keep vax mandate, start letting us pump gas! u anything like schools around here, parents find week later kids already sick. aware memory b cell cell immunity. but: need booster then? israelis getting sick. many contradictions many sources.

DeSantis touting monoclonals since refuses admit mistake regarding mask mandates (or vaccine passports??). probably news. careful, HR serve company, you. become liability might find way let go instead. Something learned number. 95% vaxxed represent, instance 20% deaths meaningful. Means 80% deaths cane non vaxxed folks. story fucked up, rational reason Jewish die firstborn Egyptians live?

Hang there. know 2 approved, we'll get there. (And can, might worth seeing vaccine trials near children 12. live highly vaccinated area 400 miles away me, might fair better. Assuming willing participate it.) immune system killing millions bacteria viruses daily.  u link Worldometers government website.

&amp;#x200B;

""In case COVID-19, vector virus delivers specific genetic instructions cells body produce harmless piece SARS-CoV-2 called spike protein. cells display spike protein immune system triggers response"". 


 think cells instructed make viral proteins ?  


DNA vector gets transcribed mRNA instructs cellular machinery make proteins encoded sequence mRNA

mRNA instructs cells make proteins need day day out. part every day biology.  
 also used viruses case vaccines produce viral proteins.  
 
The mRNA vaccines skip vector virus part use mRNA directly. 


Both still different traditional vaccines would either attenuate deactivate SARS-COV-2 virus inject that. found article helpful understanding people saying market didn’t sell study made public right away, search origins virus might taken different course. study contain conclusive evidence live animals sold human consumption epicenter outbreak, Newman says assumes Xiao collected blood-sucking ticks wild animals studiously cataloged. blood meals frozen tick samples could examined traces coronavirus, would extremely helpful identifying infected species prior December 2019. Xiao didn’t respond emails requesting comment.

The evidence sounds like would tick samples, aren’t studied? think worse 2021? hope could happen. That's awesome!

And positive experience, she'll help spread word.

That's happened flu shot me. went hell marking calendar October get one. Meanwhile, kid minor stomach bug night school started - per usual [non pandemic - course pandemic] guidance, kept home first day school (e.g. ""24 hours vomit free"" - even though fine next day), still get test come back, that's one (many) covid symptoms. 

it's quick easy get test, heck not? (Our school rapid test, school. bring quick swab school RN, calls 15 mins later) Well said. many mention even pandemic, masks seen highly rude America. often wore something covering face, associated nefarious activity \[as well cowardly\]. taught kids cough arms instead wearing masks. Masks also banned school dress-codes far know long time. Apparently, virus causes CoViD-19 protects immune system using 'hoodie' made sugars. virus periodically pulls back 'hoodie' latch onto cells.

(also, apparently, 'hoodies' fairly common viruses)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AFAIK, last year, researchers photographed viruses 'hoodies' off, photographed viruses partially fully attached human cells.

&amp;#x200B;

The OP article speaks team researchers, using super-computers, able simulate opening closing process virus's 'hoodies.' 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe one researchers behind simulation quoted OP article suggesting information could used build novel therapeutics; specifically:

&amp;#x200B;

""""""Amaro believes research team's gate discovery opens potential avenues new therapeutics counter SARS-CoV-2 infection. glycan gates could pharmacologically locked closed position, virus effectively prevented opening entry infection.""""""

('hoodie' ""gate"" them)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious whether anyone speculate (or smartulate) long permanently 'hoodied' viruses would float around system.

I'm curious whether anyone speculate (or smartulate) whether proteins make taking Pfizer similar hoodies... guess probably no; there's reason try open non-existing hoodies attempt make vaccines effective.

Lotsa question too. like said needed 15 days flatten curve? Yes, actually seen stats happens get re-infected? infection original covid good pfizer vaccine preventing death alpha infection. original infection plus pfizer vaccine makes people almost totally immune delta infection (when pfizer vaccine alone 60% effective) study came today UK. 

I'm immunologist, understand works. Variants evade immune system like think do. Even delta variant almost identical original covid far immune system concerned. Subsequent infections happen immunity wanes, long term immune memory ready reactivate happens. might catch covid mild symptoms, die it. That's long term immunity endemic pathogen looks like. That's never heard HCoV-OC43 now. Kids protected yet, currently kids within 3 months turning 18 schedule vaccine. Teenagers age 16-17 wait GP call them, classes start back soon they're running time get even first round protection. 

So, good care young people. Yea I'd like know end game too. continue part - sheltered place got vaccinated soon could. want go vaccinated people live life again. responsible people supposed shoulder burden irresponsible forever? people refuse get vaccinated ones whatever wanted whole time. thought omnipotent? guess be, frustrated could take long least die offer little hope things turning seound Fucking liars juicing stats antibodies don’t vanish. level decreases time, different different people. relates blocking initial infection- exposed, memory cells produce antibodies fight infection, well cellular immunity kicking in. vaccines work. 5-10 years still long time masks restrictions… ugh. appreciate insight sharing, thanks Jeb! Cool. order mask mandates schools late. practically begging pregnant women get vaccinated. absolute toss happen baby get Covid pregnant. chances bad outcome vaccine incredibly low plus somewhat prepare/treat (for example- fever treated Tylenol).  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Although point everyone’s vaccines I’ve full supporter lockdowns etc point things get locked rate vaccinations it’s complete bullshit move live part lives. Hoping countries get vaccination affairs order quickly too. say something press release doesn’t mean can’t still publish detailed scientific info. Heck think publish that. 

It’s you’re director CDC Fauci press conference, important exactly say tend quoted far media.

It’s kind like look prescription drugs contact lenses, site split customer vs doctor different information geared towards audience. America healthcare all

^who ^can ^afford ^it ""the study, yet peer reviewed, concludes.""

Well, let's wait see peer-review says well yeah, masking again. wait start long, rollout going well now, higher per capita daily numbers UK US reached. like in-laws! course covid New Zealand, now. would sacrifice liberty, economy, people letting covid run rampant? makes sense. thing death infectious decreasing 

So people thought safe Omg say can’t stand thought processes. Saying need mask policies still doesn’t mean forever. That’s ridiculous. “I part, I’m done now” ignoring reality. Vaccinated people get spread delta. It’s rare, it’s quite common point. SUCKS, especially basically full protection alpha. reality. protected getting ill, fully protected hospitalization death. 1/6 population can’t even get vaccinated yet ffs. novel virus, shifting changing, middle pandemic hospitals overrun. Deciding arbitrary timeline going ignore reality senseless. Refund exactly? school never altered tuition regardless person not. Oh look, they’re exactly said might happening!

You already done fair share helping, point beating up. This. Virii care political spin. 

They look new host. muscle, rather skin blatant lie. COVID evolved beyond options limit spread transmission


Respirators highly efficient use properly.


Unfortunately sadly, many people including doctors, public health authorities, media, etc, neglecting recommend use good respirators general public. hope we're right! Might make stereotypical Brit, love Spain, beautiful country I've best times life can't wait get back. Let's hope worst behind us now. rapid tests hours less accurate. Many sites them.

Lol, make up? buddy whose hardcore conspiracy theorist/anti-vaxxer legit said day.

“I think we’ll see real damage 3 years” - source: based literally nothing.

I joked 18 months data stage we’re half way still 70-90% protection hospitalization 6 months. agree they're letting drop much.

I think want delay boosters cancel already planned exports. Vote god damn , VOTE 89.7% adult population, 87.3% 16+ act like supposed make sense.

What's next, suing Catholic Church let preach Satanism pulpit instead Catholicism?  won't. ""parts Australia"" twiddled thumbs enabled rapid exponential growth go unchecked long. NZ dropped hammer immediately. wisdom pay off. I've Covid positive since middle last week, Friday still blocked nose scruffy throat (despite two doses). symptoms end?  cannot said Colorado bishops unfortunately: via air go non essential reasons ? Hopefully least permanent hybrid schedules pandemic response done. keep home get older son tested today. CPS isn’t going come knocking door today.

We policy district tested, one kids covid symptoms, they’re staying home know it’s Covid. I’m teacher. Pfizer working delta specific booster hard find much info it.

Another alternative wondering receiving 3rd dose Pfizer, I've seen information indicates significantly myocarditis cases Moderna Pfizer per vaccine given, making Pfizer safer vaccine people age gender group, although concern safety efficiency mixing Moderna Pfizer vaccines. answers questions would greatly appreciated. I'm sure continue happen. stupid problem have. It’s showed help patients early stages disease. Yes anyone get many people getting likely gaining benefit possibly hurting chances. test positive go get immediately. Someone like Gov. Abott.

But jokes aside, frustrations run out. purely leaders can't make informed risk decision. Every decision based media optics outcome. think CDC is

[CDC COVID Reporting Breakthrough May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause.  Governor big part problem.While outspoken taking vaccine also take measures outside telling people responsible.
Her saying ""Alabama open business"" proudly ignoring going ignorant.
She said ideas..So step aside lead.
She panders moronic base,and sadly 65% state. mean... he's hospital, great. It’s true. Smallpox horrible disease it’s easy prevent. first vaccine ever developed 1796 (thanks cows). low-hanging fruit eradication. Full press Right. think quote used context explain mitigation measures going necessary. 

Once EUA exists 5-11yr group, think we'll past peak number population easily infected going lot lower due prev infections, adequate immune response vaccine, increased mask usage. likely fall timeframe Pfizer winter Moderna. u/chazj says: HIPAA. 

Medical privacy, yes, courtesy, ethics, etc.—NOT law, especially HIPAA that, assumes homogeneous mixing populations, instantaneous infection, personal measures, etc. pretty much case everywhere US. Rural and/or poor. Across races. Getting wrecked false logic virus. Unpopular theory here, don’t think that’s moving people. think laaarge chunk “newly vaccinated” people seeking boosters. Several friends posed first time vaxxers get another one deathly terrified virus, work healthcare risk populations go back Jan/Feb/March like myself. free all. started wearing masks mandated thing stayed day outside rural clinics waiting someone turn dose could get Jan. They’ve slow boosters delta breakthroughs rage. really really don’t blame people taking lie whatever save lives. Heard Texas hospitals use vax status criteria beds full. Let's forget potentially violent anti-vaxxers! 

I can't WAIT!/s I'm young healthy. already acceptable risk. common side effects, would heard now. See map texas (scroll two screens down) note governor abbot said bullshit. urban areas highest vaccinated texas lowest happened Kay Ivey beginning saying would follow Drs,and Science?
She huge let down.All done take half steps,and pander base,then got news base caused,and causing lost shit,and blamed saying ideas.Up praised ""the good folks Alabama"" part.my entire family vaccinated,we masked distanced since began still do.My kids 2nd year virtual school,we go except work,and groceries Drs.
I tired proud ignorance,and defiance morons show.We suffer,and overflow hospitals.
All kids 12 could vaccinated,but kept parents kills me.Thet literally killing kids,and screaming comply simplest measures.
Ivey may ideas,but patience idiots. Great book. Wait, live New York State, got notes said head lice classroom. didn’t get specific people, got told kid child’s classroom them. heard predictions US could start seeing 200,000 plus new infections every day. frustrating preventable part. batshit crazy always thing. don’t know exact rules knew multiple Canadian friends US many times year. Outdoor activities definitely lower COVID-19 risk I’ve coughing blood 18 months, confirm psychological- also would agree think it’s post viral illnesses flu inaccurate. probably think since got exposed it, they’ll immunity don’t need either vaccine mess. antibody treatments available anyone now? Like kid caught covid, could get one treatments wait severe case, case antibody treatment help much anymore. Well blame Jebus. world created 9 days something……sorry information wrong I’m big reading fiction. Maybe need Noah’s ark style cleansing earth stupid fake religious Republicans. Maybe move back Russia born. sorry false information (humor people). seriously fuck Republicans they’re stupid religion. different Taliban Hell even Lauren Bobert supports Taliban guess that’s Republicans kept voted her. she’s Taliban supporter applies mitigation measures significant immunity population. Germany's system called Mixed Member Proportional. also used New Zealand, great system.

People keep saying 'Ranked choice voting' would help, really. Typically people referring instant runoff say ranked choice. Although proportional systems use ranking, important part breaking two party stranglehold system proportional - i.e. party gets 20% votes, get 20% seats. Generally, no.

Reimplementing restrictions risky people simply won’t follow — what? 

I don’t endorse behavior, humans generally aren’t going tolerate restrictions/limits forever.  hospitals collapse something that's preventable highly vaccinated population. certain governments would rather cater antivaxxers what's needed protect society. mean, like that. would love something that's good something that's awful. basically swab straight plane, went results came back within 6 hours landing.  1. whole topic strictly reference US people want boosters future. flu shots yearly. far infeasible.

3. That’s sad reality. won’t first instance western vs developing world inequity. said, ventures see massive amounts success simultaneously. US leading world vaccine donations plans increase, countries surely contribute well. well, goes zero covid policy window. vaccinated people faster. Anyone vaccinated healthy - especially young live whatever life want to. Younger healthy people faced little risk covid, vaccination risk minuscule.

And negotiate people argue bad faith. never happy even they're capitulated to. Keeping cases control always best way, people US educated enough think long term. honestly think that's is.

With amount idiots getting vaccinated, never end case.

I explained family member good math / statistics means. 
I still sure fully grasp it, feel good read situation aligns experts. would thought Alabama MS but.... 101% correct, even inconvenient. Reality UK Europe also tough autumn winter even higher vaccination rates much less antivax sentiment. Vaccines absolutely reduced hospitalizations ""only"" 50% (look ratio hospitalizations cases vs. last winter/spring, see mean), transmission still high - higher last summer, means we're entering September not-great place. combine reality restrictions, patchy mask-wearing, schools offices reopening en masse, people caring virus anymore, absolutely get jump cases bad wave hospitalizations autumn/winter even highly vaccinated population. Delta wicked. lurk /r/nursing read unvaxxed patient stories. article here. I've linked before, 20% vaccinated healthcare workers breakthrough cases studied ended long covid. still better 30% shown studies unvaccinated. still need data it.

The vaccines work still working better could imagined. told cdc mask sole purpose chance everyone masks county unvaccinated people. safety measures taking.

Likewise, New Zealand also collective heads straight believe UK's strat behind fully reopening right now. feeling natural selection Darwinism finally catching humans. strange thing see. UK recently said 40% cases breakthrough think high US. Mostly vaccination rate lower, partially vaccines slightly better preventing symptomatic infection (although, evidence claim feels rather thin). really (the US) clue. We're looking.

Possibly even bigger factor: Vaccination, responsible adult, tightly coupled US. So, unvaccinated least likely making changes day reduce risk exposure. Maybe that's also true UK, I'm guessing much? shorter contagious window able fend infection faster. Delta contagious symptoms whether vaccinated, vaccinated increase potential spread infection, especially consider breakthrough infections less common unvaccinated infections. asking data risk factors, saying was.

It’s true overall kids rarely seriously affected covid, undeniable, want know more. pretty aggressive response. Get fucked Abbott, hope Florida next DeSantis bullshit bans. Oh yes, understand mean. trouble hearing people time. need people enunciate normally tend mumble mask makes worse. I’m vaxxed Xanaxed. Let’s need normal Christmas sanity. must like 90% people form immunity now, Delta wave already peaking, we're getting boosters starting fall. winter going bad??? article really say.  Unfortunately CDC gets blame want track breakthroughs end hospitalized pass away (admittedly easy) best maybe look smaller data sets.  predicted 20+ years never really happened. Dealing time zone difference US India bit nightmare getting teams produce incredibly difficult. Nevermind quality products usually come door well.

Fact matter is, successful tech companies care talent, cost. get best best Bangalore, will. get $20k/yr, competition willing pay significantly that's case. Someone good science statistics explain isn’t death blow converting anti-vaxxers. Twitter fire right quoting haven’t heard anything put perspective. classic ""damned do, damned don't"" situation

China takes strict approach controlling COVID, media outlets blame draconian stifling economy (which IMO false dichotomy - solving health crisis boost economy long-term)

But China this, instead cases (and deaths) increasing rapidly, media outlets blame China inability control cases, spreading COVID around world I'm convinced point better understanding prevention long covid. Could imagine rolling 3 sided dice long term disability every time got cold flu. vaccinated might give 1 5 odds. That's good enough convinced go back normal. risked odds brain damage instead miserable days every time got cold I'd sure hell avoid catching avoid public places people spreading it. No, hospitals still filling recently announced state emergency there. Currently mask mandate, 1 meter rule (3 feet), bars close midnight, 200 people come together. strict, still restrictions.  hear Australia??? US vaccinating Zoo animals!!

Sheesh, world :) put context; effect they’re studying something “think” might happening rate 12.6 people *per million.*

Yeah, they'll shift camps Yemen Syria. back Afghanistan. likely back Afghanistan, given time Taliban massive influx foreign fighters, potentially Al Qaeda ties. Given rapid collapse Afghan government, would CIA able foster assets Afghanistan? They'd rely satellite imagery Pakistanis. 
The way prevent training camps Afghanistan flood country regeneration aid via Taliban. Which, Vietnam indication likely happen. They'll create embargo country, Taliban reach ""alternate"" sources funding. Hell, Australians even refusing cooperate Taliban order evacuate citizens. can't rhyme. consistently combined vaccines masks could better outcomes.  majority, it’s problem. fringe traditional Catholics problem thinking conspiracy, vaccines moral evil, end times, etc, etc, etc fact there's limit outdoor exercise ridiculous given know outdoor transmission. masks ineffective thing frustrating situation. beginning really know cotton masks were, know N95 masks surgical masks were. due PPE shortage, want encourage non-essential people purchase actual medical supplies.

1. Heavily increased vaccine production. Main reason beaten virus big pharmaceuticals heavily dropped ball production. Releasing patents vaccines may greatly help alleviate this.

2. Quicker updates present vaccines. We've boasted able tweak vaccines target new variants within weeks, yet seem using vaccines released since December combat future variants?

3. global effort control future strains. genuinely think UN make useful start sanctioning nations refuse impose lockdowns new strain emerges country. point, honestly believe that--with remote work--companies like Apple continue pay salaries based HCOL Bay Area employees go live somewhere cheap?

I'd bet anything won't, companies already explicitly said this. Preach brother I’m seeing articles different states countries say “Why now? six months ago?”   Solution: Unvaccinated choice?

At least remote work, economy evenly spread out, everyone prosper 21st Century, including bright-minded individuals cannot afford physically located near big city.

Of course means broadband infrastructure, that's different conversation (that even GOP supports). Ya, immensely helpful me. spent 2 hours driving store store, called 41 stores pharmacies, home test available.  sounds silly ever tried VR? bought oculus quest 2 dad. depressed sad basically human contact aside mother I. well now. made ton friends VR. close wants plan meet whenever over. experience even though avatars cartoonist actually feels like person's presence. hard explain. Anyway plays games people like pokerstars vr, chess, population one, fishing game, dead buried 2.  long though? 94% adults, including children.

High school students spread ton. 1 year making $11.02/hr, starting $10.40 amount making Fred Meyer going hospital. minimum Idaho still $7.50. worked kitchen staff always 1-3 short left. Every day heard nurse leaving. Things looking finally finished isolation unit (10 beds) right left. hospital services 1 city 70,000 people total 2 partial counties (as well full one) 200,000 people area, 150-bed hospital. seeing Idaho lot. last 30 years, private hospitals replaced county (government ones) lower bed counts fewer in-house services, price healthcare gone way up. area NEEDS least 1 hospital, think 2 handle flow better, eat $20M year profit. guess I’ll one break you, everyone earth likely infected COVID point. you’re vaccinated, live life. We're reaching herd immunity whether people like not. get antibodies easy way hard way. Strange didn’t blame Mexicans like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. change motto everyone's dumber Texas?  Delta follows pattern took countries likely peak relatively fast numbers begin drop again, especially areas high vaccine uptake. Remember, even low vaccine uptake parts country USA still pretty highly vaccinated compared places world, especially over-65 population pretty vaccinated. 

If want personal opinion think another, much smaller wave November-December-January correlates holidays people gathering inside more. mirror current one, low-vaccine areas get hit harder, much smaller current Delta surge. late winter/early spring (barring another, crazy variant) things mostly returned normal places USA virtually everyone either vaccinated infected. think places USA see rotating mask requirements like early next year, nothing universal places life mostly normal vast majority people, especially kids get shot (and hell, already many places... looking around I'm social end pandemic happened June governor lifted mask mandate). stupid.

It's designed party consolidate power. plan (a) make situation disastrous possible, (b) blame party cleaning mess.

Check Dan Patrick's recent statements. That's *exactly* what's going here.

Of course, kind plan works (a) uneducated, gullible voter base, (b) limp, feckless opposing party call besides couple pro forma ""we really wish that"" statements. 

So we're doomed. too, super frustrating. I'm immunocompromised bad lungs, I'm single dad me. going suck, I'm vaccinated worried kids. located? you’re US wouldn’t expect thing really need affiliate link I’ve sent many damn people. 

But worked getting UK also returning US it’s fantastic.  rhymed chan chan get ban. get fucking van. Anything involving India counting humans safely assumed ridiculously inaccurate. Nobody knows sure needed. may needed boosted immunity may durable well. may needed elderly. 

On hand turn we’ll require annual booster , booster 80-90% effective , that’s horrible thing. would expect COVID endemic, absent new universal vaccines. So, people probably either get disease shot.... No, first detected August 2020 made massive progress/dent delta. think time we're safe assume infectious delta can't really make assumptions pathology vaccine effectiveness. short is, current evidence suggests super variant - delta still #1 enemy long shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over next couple years we're going see many variants. So, based completely untrained uneducated opinion Lamda going one rip across half human population. Thank you, ordered! see story teenage girl Mississippi? Jeez one rough. star pupil close knit community died days. week school lost band director COVID. Utterly preventable since eligible vaccine. Even interview mother showed probably wasnt enough change behavior vaccines use attenuated virus, yes, discussing whole inactivated virus sound awful ignorant mRNA vaccines someone pushing onto others without much, knowledge TV tells you, use “how many flu shot” argument valid points.

Wtf? Explain please. Considering vaccines don’t shit cellular replication machinery, that’s dubious shit Sounds like bs roads lead Omega I'm suppose surgery December year. already started Pre-Op process. mentally planning treatment pushed back Jerks Vaccinate. pissed surprised.

Mask alert situation soon  Still way slower be. vaccination rate increase, welcome anyways, barely moving forward. One dose adult number still 72.5%. moving snail's pace.

We see theology wins suppose. Job performance matters. people happier work home still perform job well, forcing people unhappiness benefit perceived necessarily real?

I could easily argue daily commute time dress up, reduced comfort outside home would outweigh benefits listed terms productivity impact. think agreeing point.

Reciprocity makes sense. Considerations like absolutely make sense. Scientific experts urged us hold ""Freedom Day"", originally scheduled 21st June pushed back 19th July Delta variant.

We legitimate fears new daily cases going skyrocket well 200k end August. looking increasingly unlikely.

The unthinkable happened. New cases peaked 54,183 17th July, plummeted less half figure within course nine days, they've slowly rising since. ZOE's data also suggests symptomatic infections dropped remain stable moment.

It's quite ironic highly vaccinated nations, we've almost completely dropped social distancing mask mandates reimposed restrictions since. however looking impose domestic vaccine passports enter large scale venues nightclubs end September. plans highly contested. feel state fair requiring masks (I get this, since outside fair food) requiring vaccination/negative test enter?  Emed.com great self test, deliver next day, I’ve using travel. take test video conference work lot travel requirements. That'd awfully long title, sure could bit better. make anywhere near straight shitty though.

Since fourth COVID wave began April, HCM City recorded 165,000 cases. city carried social distancing 43 days Government’s Directive 16. — VNS  CDC monitoring hospitalized worse cases, acknowledge anyone that's vaccinated tests positive breakthrough case. That's put qualifier they're monitoring.  idea. shit never politicized. couldn’t go college without vaccines, couldn’t get current job without TB test. Public health measures thing forever, idk there’s much pushback. It’s far less fit compared delta, it’s prevalence tells us nothing level infectiousness.   Uncertainty quarantine rules teaching plans city public school students exposed COVID-19 cases sowing confusion weeks kids return class.

In-person public school classes start Sept. 13, Mayor de Blasio spelled criteria officials use decide students must isolate home exposure coronavirus case class, schools instruct quarantine.

The lack clarity ratcheting stress levels city parents worried school disruptions. Educators uncertain they’ll continue teaching rolling quarantines interrupt in-person classes.
“I’m pretty sure least couple kids going quarantined. think would better plan now,” said Stacie Johnson, parent elementary-schooler Bushwick, Brooklyn. “They giving us crazy, last-minute changes. Last year pretty stressful year.”


Some lawmakers advocates criticized mayor’s decision offer remote option students school year. argue system would allow students keep learning temporary quarantine.

“That really irresponsible outrageous Aug. 19 — principals taking well-deserved time waiting mayor kindly come plan,” said City Council Member Mark Treyger (D-Brooklyn), called city offer virtual option kids 12 immunocompromised students.

De Blasio stayed steadfast refusal continue full-time remote learning, citing benefits in-person classes kids low COVID-19 transmission last year city schools. Building citywide remote school would major undertaking staffing curriculum needs.

“I absolutely convinced health safety measures put place, lot vaccination going happen opening day school ... [in-person school] going place kids need be,” de Blasio said Thursday.



But big logistical health questions still remain in-person school look like.

Officials haven’t yet specified criteria determine students need quarantine COVID exposure.

During much last school year, city officials enforced quarantine policy epidemiologists agreed overly cautious, temporarily shuttering entire school buildings two positive, unrelated cases cropped within week other. protocol resulted widespread back-and-forth closures.



The current rules, effect city’s summer school, mandate 10-day quarantines unvaccinated students staff sharing classroom someone infected. Vaccinated kids teachers required quarantine. Whole schools closed four cases officials conclude virus transmitted school.

As Thursday, 266 individual classrooms across nearly 800 sites offering summer school programs closed temporary quarantines, according DOE data.

De Blasio suggested Tuesday city continue standard exempting vaccinated kids adults mandatory quarantine. DOE officials immediately respond question whether city adopt CDC guidance allowing even unvaccinated kids sharing room infected classmate forego quarantine long kids wearing masks — measure would likely cut significantly number kids required isolate home.

Then there’s question schools continue teaching kids forced quarantine. Several districts across country committed teaching quarantined students online, others say they’ll livestream in-person classes. districts plan send kids home paper packets, according recent review Chalkbeat.

Treyger worries schools saddled extra work produce uneven results without coordinated help guidance city instruct kids quarantine.

Johnson, Bushwick parent, said hopes least time school day daughter receive remote instruction regular teacher she’s quarantine.

“You’d think would way jiggle around … would least hour teacher could log kids home,” said.

De Blasio said Thursday details plans teach kids quarantine coming days. Keep eye /r/COVID19, they're pretty keen upvoting J&amp;J studies. Yeah I’m saying careful making statements like “we’re learning many people really don’t care kids,” least percentage parents right things. really fucking hope right, sinking feeling you’re wrong, least America. Hold butts.  Bloody PERFECT response! think they're sustainable another year two we're still transitioning Covid endemicity. 6 months ago approved nearing approval country's equivalent FDA legal issues. Losing medical staff, vaccinated not, middle pandemic would cause people die halls waiting rooms. Nursing homes already understaffed can't function losses. 

Basically harm caused antivaxxers quitting would greater harm cause continuing work. pick poison situation. higher vaccinated areas like Maryland lose many people vaccine mandate. bumfuck Texas I'm afraid may collapse lose antivaxxers majority.

In rather ironic twist need antivaxxers keep working help us deal antivaxxers getting sick.

I'd say age 80+ hit hardest. again, 95% 80+ vaccinated, it'll interesting see 16-18 follow trend. 

For worth, 18-24 year old higher vaccination rate 25-30s.  I'm glad ok! doctors give insight you, fully vaccinated person, experienced dangerous level infection? I'm teacher, fully vaccinated, go back classroom next week. I'm pretty worried become vaccinated person ICU wondering happens people. Really glad got it. So… based numbers, would mean 71% unvaccinated adults got COVID? That’s staggering number. Even take high-end estimates single dose (82-90%), that’s still well 20%.

I’m research role, myself. guess would may help, vaccinated people already reduced infection average. resources treat everyone it, would probably wise. people probably also calling Biden denied communion following Church teaching. goes show GOP show. made point. everyone wear masks school.

But moment sun made everyone FIGHT basic civility. embolden conservatives think they're losing absurd ""war"" think they're fighting.

It's part strategy. mind losing. actually play better behind. I've heard combination tested.

Why interested J&amp;J booster? think lot people like ""We hunker even vaccinated!!!"" mostly privileged people gotten work home whole pandemic. us vaccinated go outside whole pandemic work stuff, immediately weight lifted shoulders got vaccinated, recognize is: medical breakthrough gave us lives back.

Absolutely impossible, I'm 100% sure guys. omg... please stop... CDC site makes clear, 7-day moving average DAILY deaths. chart allows see deaths day. Add divide 7 see numbers above. 

So 25,654 deaths year... 179,580 year. eventual flip-flop. Meanwhile California... Lawsuits 3..2..1.. mark “allowed now”

Unnecessary uncertainty best strategy public health policy according Abbott who’s 3rd shot already.

...but monoclonal antibodies without moments hesitation? mean testing vaccinated unvaccinated people frequently well? read months ago concern myocarditis younger men received Pfizer Israel. wonder new finding associated comparatively larger dose given Moderna vs Pfizer.  

I wouldn’t surprised find effective vaccination come multiple smaller doses delivered longer period. vaccines behave way? Isn’t rabies vaccination series several shots multiple days weeks? good friend sent hospital yesterday. Fully vaccinated pfizer, 35 years old. Healthy underlying conditions. really hate everyone thinks vaccinated never end hospital die. are. significantly better odds vaccinated that's it. employer going accept wonder mentions Sinovac / Sinopharm ... ""not work"" ?

Anyhoo got Moderna 1st shot, yay :D   children, imagine would like asking ""Did wearing shirt school day create issues?"" question would strange. (at least I) accepted COVID boosters part life like getting annual flu shot. Ideally roll two single shot.

The new mRNA based flu vaccine supposed approved soon. Maybe bundle together? Moderna much higher dosage. effective Pfizer Delta studies coming side effects due higher dosages ? Future pandemic movies changing everyone relieved confident CDC staff enter room everyone face palming derpy CDC staff enter room someone says, ""Get morons here."" like point booster shot lmao? time start considering whether time start conversation whether consider reality may possibility may one day need booster. important point - vaccination rates approach saturation, hospitalizations vaccinated. fully vaccinated wife ended getting COVID June. fully vaccinated, never transmitted virus me, tells vaccine worked two levels:

1. completely protected infection
2. reduced severity wife's infection. still got sick (and already immunocompromised), never hospitalized.

She probably got unvaccinated 10 year old daughter, came virus days wife. Well, considering 1/2 US adult population vaccinated, VAST majority Covid deaths vaccinated, think wrong. said got first dose January. safe? all. expect people wear masks pandemic. control, masks. I'd view immunocompromised relatives. governor said one reasons spike COVID-19 cases coming schools.

No reason couldn’t include many children tested positive.  shit fucking sucks. I’m destigmatizing, MAN idea talking title. That's 500 deaths day, week. looking CDC data represents 7 day moving average DAILY deaths. Stop spreading Weird Guardian reports 62% fully vaccinated today. worries, get it. think it’s good talk stuff out. enough days.

😊  people also believe literal mass shooting casualties hoax paid actors.

Dont keep hopes  Still uses fiber lines. Yup, got vaccinated part (and get boosters advised to) fully moving normalcy whether people like not.

Thanks, you. came hostile anything truly wasn’t trying to, it’s tough “agree disagree” nuanced discussions stuff. pre-delta. sure everyone agrees US whole first world anymore. Much less South specifically. :-P article says guy already vaccinated, still got sick. said. said ""WHO calling moratorium boosters least end September, enable least 10% population every country vaccinated.""

From cannot accept countries already used global supply vaccines using even it, world’s vulnerable people remain late May, called global support “sprint September”, enable every country vaccinate least 10% population end September. We’re halfway target date, we’re track.

Yes entire family got covid time still doesn’t change mind get vaccinated. 

I told herself, get family friends.. said “well you’re vaccinated PROBABLY alright give you” literally stopped talking point. Vaccination treatment... way see doctor No, .1 100,000 - words, 1 million. second hit India fucked.

Delta originated India... so... mean kids 12 infected? I've got friend camp. I'm avoiding till over.

The chance stance delta fuel ""see, making data up"" rather logical truth science moves ahead situations change. Moderna's data booster pushes antibody neutralization higher wildtype, implying efficacy delta infection could back 94% then. 

Israel data claims 86% improvement booster, though really think recent Israel numbers reliable. 

Countries 3 month gap first second shots (UK) seeing decline yet, promising happens third shot.

But seems pretty clear one month gap regimen want booster. Don’t know u downvoted this. share sentiment well. would trust safety someone doesn’t believe science either ways. don’t even think half people join police department actually protect serve community. sense power know “they law”. super high population children (especially compared developed countries), adult population highly vaxxed anyone know BinaxNOW rapid antigen test meets requirement ""antigen FIA test""? know FIA means googling around helping states, children required parental consent vaccines.

Well yeah, number worse scenarios possible too! really, high CFR direct advantage virus either. benefits most, evolutionary terms, possible living things passing around meekly serving hosts reproduction.

In way, covid actually worst could be. super high fatality rate, hospitalization rate length hospitalization still terrible. healthy people get live, they'll maximally stress society's resources process... say nothing potential long-haul effects. seeing people literally drop dead streets drowning blood on, vs. quietly dwindling away quarantine respirators, see antivaxxers, vaccine hesitancy, covidiocy working public health policy. Luckily, problem seems handling itself. county health officer said today anticipates vaccines 5-11 year olds approved early October sooner. seems much earlier previously expected can't find source back up. anyone know anything?? honestly. opened early. still lockdown.  frustrating preventable part.

BTW got email doctor's office apparently qualified booster shot. Interestingly still say supposed take brand originally (Pfizer). also leaves people took J&amp;J ice.

Is reason requiring brand, tracking side effects? people childish delusional believe covid real  dying  course not! alternative would involve actually learning ***admit they're F'ing wrong!*** would damaging ego literally dying disease. Right get sick, numbers implying 5% chance becoming hospitalized unvaccinated vs 4% chance vaccinated. 

Vaccination however reduces chance becoming sick 34%. seems unexpectedly low slept awhile, maybe eff'd math. sMaLl gUbmInT 

DOnT tReAD ask helpful citizens won’t wear masks get vaccinated something else people. work fine. seems right 🤦‍♂️   Bad take PR horribly stupid. 

This data looks like actually completely honest. You’re telling public health officer SF Bay Area. “STFH” something we’re advising time, good reason. level caution longer necessary, I’m sorry messaging led believe that.

As rant growing up, im really glad defending people find difficult, good reason makes seem like child eyes. think honestly fucking hysterical assume people refusing get vaccinated going comply wearing masks. mandate shots enforce it. wanna get shot, tough shit, normalcy you. Absolutely! FEMA set mass vaccination sites. Get Alabama vaccine need get everybody shots. boosters? first time get vaccinated? I've 3 shots several vaccines diseases. We've known since spring 2020. even new Delta. reason hygiene theater contain it. mass testing, masking, proper ventilation capacity limits help stop spread. Covid brilliant disease turns assumptions procedures containing infectious disease upside down. really takes advantage blind spots collective thoughts habits. means squat talking cases. matters total population vaccinated. don’t know ur tryna say. I’m vaccinated continued take precautionary measures. point ur unlikely get skeptical people low risk dying u deliberately hide numbers mislead people political manner cdc done repeatedly Ask Gov Abbott explained many COVID-19 patients require liquid oxygen treatment. OUC used liquid oxygen treat water supply locally demand liquid oxygen high COVID-19 surged many said could impacts water quality city reduce amount water need treat. Isn’t good though? feel fine number cases isn’t daunting. Nope! fully vaccinated mum can't visit UK directly hangs high risk country like Mexico Turkey two weeks totally fine! Site study please. peer reviewed study? one? Long covid shown blown proportion vaccinated, taken seriously enough vaccinated. Meaning, somewhere between. grave risk everyone makes out, still serious enough need get vaccine. keeping track stats Worldmeters seeing sharp decline deaths Florida past 2 weeks:

6 days ago, Florida's 7-day moving average deaths peaked August 5th sharp decline right after. Today, 7-day moving average shows peaked even higher, August 8th (at 148 deaths) sharp decline right after.

So seems Florida regularly reporting low number deaths every day, quietly updating numbers weeks later. Dead-first would appropriate. sad! Without vaccine mandate mean.

Lollapalooza seem issue. Az pretty much shelved Europe, relatively high risk blood clots younger people means recommend older people here. top new studies showed less effective Pfizer/Moderna, many European countries recomend people waiting second AZ dose get Pfizer instead. 
And even long delays deliveries EU. guess never felt like could completely fulfill US orders, file approval EU stopped using it...  Greetings sunny (stormy) Florida! winter came early it’s shit show. currently two temperatures… surface sun worst storm you’ve ever seen. Usually day. inside time. Add fuckwads live currently breaking new covid records daily. 

I can’t wait winter rainy season ends air dry tolerable outside enjoy life again. Unfortunately, unusual. Many countries excess deaths considerably exceed reported covid deaths. seen [the Economist.

Note many countries lack detailed historical death reports, meaning way knowing excess death guestimate it. Among others, that's case African several Asian countries. actual infection estimated closer Idk. back shit really hit fan. VP recently follow meeting everyone reiterated shit. know sort off-topic, I'd love know old are, worldview includes ""having 100 contacts."" :D flu vaccine starts less 50% effective, iirc thought well. care religious beliefs (or aren't). support defend everyone's rights believe believe. However, religious beliefs can't include right put risk. want wear mask get vaccinated religion? Fine. expect use free pass expose endanger others. kind sick religious belief would anyway? private university mandating vaccine? Rice students vaccinated, hospital? questions best answered specialist?/ collapse civilization starts. Unfortunately, people vaccinated still get sick. it’s legal ethical deny care unvaccinated favor treating responsible got vaccine, even though it’s incredibly frustrating. 

I patient admitted last night, though hypoxic brain may clouded judgement, made sure tell (between labored breaths) wanted decline vaccine. 

I finding far less compassionate time around. aware it, can’t change it, frankly starting question profession point. 

The facility work decided make vaccination mandatory, week it’s nothing conspiracy theories rights freedoms that. nursing staff probably 50% unvaccinated it’s hard listen day day out. Snowboarding savior think depends are. Someone likened vaccinated low vaccinated area wet log fire. Probably bad analogy..... hospitals start turning unvaccinated people away. trust doctors prevent getting sick? trust heal you.  could get vaccine spare this. use oxygen create ozone disinfect water. better approach using chlorine disinfecting water. also it, double vaccinated - mild cold best.  demon made be, me, personally. lot people getting sick dying, dispute that. big deal. Delta fatal attaches better harder body fight, lasts longer. Even vaccinated.  longer duration, continues spread. try using nice dry flower vaporizer - find smoking hits real hard get anxious come bit. vape high lot smoother clear headed. everyone different. I'm fairly certain vaccines used zoo animals human vaccines. Israel paid price early rollout. Health officials, Pfizer, said data showed dip vaccine's protection around six months receiving second shot.

Waning vaccine efficacy hard prove. confound dominant strains easily transmissible. So, infections rising vaccine effectiveness waning, newer variants? difficult tease apart causality. essential oils industry booming! seems... wildly unreasonable, although know evidence well.

I think preference would occasional sub-infectious nasal colonizations kept antibodies topped up, although I'm also fine frequent vaccine boosters. Good news, bad news I'd say. side good:

1)DNA stable RNA, storage less problem. 

2)A DNA vaccine produced quicker lower cost RNA one.

Bad news:

1)Unlike RNA vaccine DNA one get cell also cell's nucleus. may connected with...

2)This vaccine seems less immunogenic RNA products. article reports manufacturer recommends three doses rather two

3) possibility DNA plasmid may integrate genome patient. Plasmids are, fact, one tools fo genetic engineering. case effects plasmid/patient DNA integration unknown. Perhaps none. Perhaps great effect. real - got card past May. things get bad again, least there'll weed time. I'm fully vaccinated, give shit happens people choose vaccinated, kids unable vaccinated? need know feel. OUC used liquid oxygen treat water supply years. Dyer said could impacts water quality city reduce amount water need treat. Isreal half hospitalizations vaccinated folks, nationally good vaccination rates (80%).  100% agreeing getting vaccinated needed obvious, like wearing mask public. point things still wont protect completely unless new booster vaccine gets developed. virus winning point sadly. rate going country, going need Doctors Without Borders.  water liquid oxygen? (I can't read article, unfortunately tells ""not available region""...)  live Moscow. 

Delta variant ravaging country, we've around 800 confirmed Covid-19 deaths day past month half (and government stats, know those).

With said, barely anybody wears masks (I feel like people look weirdo see wear one), vaccination levels low AF despite vaccine readily available (you get vaccinated mall). 

I'm mad! That's great opinion I'm disparanging it. I'd rather opposite. I'd rather get mild covid avoid really nasty disease. know vaccines wearing off, know latest strain broken - best case scenario get mild covid every 6 months keep antibodies system (and keep immune system primed). rocket scientist doesn’t want vax I’m sure lot people qualified job waiting Home Depot  fit narrative tell everyone get vaccine times matter thing help end pandemic. pretty amazing people want focus vaccine much rapid testing little. rapid testing, people activity negligible risk, especially compared vaccines allow spread.

This say vaccines bad, useless, they're useful, especially risk populations. they're golden ticket end pandemic /r/Masks4All list reputable sellers. learned triage Vietnam era, genius. know medical ethics, don't.

There ethical reason withhold ICU treatment unvaccinated COVID patients, vs vaccinated COVID patients. time disease progressed point benefit vaccination passed, equal outcomes.

Cuba plenty faults, good healthcare system. friend works hospital Portland area txted last night...""In news ...we almost ICU beds need open another COVID unit hospital...national guard coming too. may getting patients transferred hospitals Oregon completely run"" That's personal prediction barring something unforeseen. 


My personal prediction: 

The places got hit Delta first see peaks drops areas country see waves. Things calm bit next winter wave.

Meanwhile, vaccines get full approval along 5-11 age group also approved fall. Booster shots also start rolling high risk groups first rest population. Expect vaccine mandates start coming well. ""The war Christmas"" Floridians see stuff like praise lard SLC Thanks Gov. Brian Kemp fro helping turn Georgia Blue! thanks Gov. Brian Kemp though turning Georgians blue :( HEEEEEEEY! MACARENA!  people wearing masks stop unvaccinated people getting Covid

It stops them, that's slows transmission. would 3 sided dice looke like? I've read really depends cloth. many different styles materials ways made. even 4 layers middle pocket fit one surgical masks even better filter. confusing, really. many varieties. carrots, sticks

What Earth mean? I’m able watch moment. it’s much trouble, response? Yeah nothing compares benzodiazepines It’s 90%. 60% number comes children cannot vaccinated. Calm down, everyone, vaccines still work. Delta many inches face hold lighter/candle flame test mask? 


I'm finding information online. Looking answer, thanks exactly we've seen countries. Everyone already CDC said masks longer required. long masks required every single human being, virus going keep circulating. shit Kids still get preferential treatment vaccines approved yet. people choosing vax sit curb let amazing immune system save themselves. I’m sorry. HIV positive relative, worry every day this. That’s really story around maybe everywhere though, right? county almost 72% vaccinated. neighbors? 38%. Again, 800 billionth time, no, legal issues mandating anything EUA. made up, thing. (Aside states like Ohio specifically passed laws past couple months forbid mandates anything EUA)

With said, everyone wrongly assumed everyone would get vaccine everything would take care itself. reason mandate anything.

Now clear nothing get back normal unless forced, mandates (FINALLY) starting pop almost everywhere. Haha thanks laugh, that's pretty old episode. depressing little changed. Many saying while. Breakthrough cases way higher don’t hospitalized actually counted. weird. trying brainstorm ways could increase proportion people rational critical thinking skills society.  expect solution removing conspiracy theorists...

It’s obviously still heights First all, talking hypothetical societal impact potential long term cognitive effects covid. reply general topic.

But better opening prematurely (before herd immunity) ending massive surge like US performing top economic side precisely need lock massive numbers people every time ICUs full like here.

I live US, anyway, US recovering economically better faster countries world, including New Zealand.

And also: told US lockdowns containing therefore massive surge...but tell China lock massive numbers people every time ICUs full, unlike US...which *not* locking massive numbers people?

I would even go far saying average American living outside pockets (especially NYC Bay Areas) subject fewer restrictions overall since last summer average Chinese. significantly least. first lockdown also significantly less cost testing containment clearly less cost shut economy.

The point large vaccine coverage need either these, increasing number countries showing. additionally heavily impacted 

Those actually work industry China beg differ: Considering absolutely cannot avoid contact COVID positive people work environment.
 
New hospital influx covid patients. they’ll spread virus non-covid patients hospital outside public..
 
That's already problem. Nothings going solve that. (and have) gone hospital recently days ago. checks, temperature checks, vaccine card asked displayed. covid, way knowing that. GA actually put language ""consumer protection"" law.  FFS morons charge here. better moniker might wrong said dead [You already get doctors note required. attest it. lying identity lying immunosuppressed, think I'm going latter. Vaccinated people wearing masks stop unvaccinated people getting Covid, slows transmission rate (the old 2 weeks bend curve mantra). 

Also, people need realistic mask mandates. Washington DC, mask mandate, required bars/night clubs restaurants since people eating/drinking. Even mayor wear mask sitting table even eating/drinking. So, masking reduce transmission rates bit, going stop transmission. Great! waste heart someone likely ruin heart covid anyway stupidity. Give someone cares living. can't take vaccine save life, maybe take pills needs.

transplant recipients weak immune systems, gets covid transplant gone.  question works vaccinated people all. rather get it. Studies Regeneron proven really effective given around onset symptoms. Since vaccine already 90% effectiveness preventing hospitalisation, makes sense give person vaccinated, likely fine without (and time notice needed late administer it...). 
Even surge availability, antibodies finite resource given likely benefit, would people hight risk, unvaccinated early illness. good studies month two. Mandatory outdoor masking absurd. sure logically makes sense, seeing someone coming airport sitting airplane 100 people/chance catching covid vs 1/100 chance. well late now, perhaps recovers thought MS requesting hospital ship...issue state wide mask mandate f'ing ship...but without mandate would throwing water balloon wild fire. tolerance went away/way down. love feeling high established tolerance. smoke first time long time, always uncomfortable makes anxious rebuild tolerance again. usually get around smoking very, little time start again. arent going get *anyone* vaccinated calling idiot.

Thanks.  Older people also frequently poor immune response vaccines. cheaper offer booster 80+ test antibody levels. Seems virus wants pandemic lol. Smart. Thanks, I'll go try that. hospital virus, vaccine going now? yeah high percentage. read CDC even tracking normal breakthrough cases anymore, tracking ""severe"" breakthrough cases.

It also said members Rice community tested positive Covid despite high vaccination rates — 98.5 percent — among student body.

“I’ll blunt: level breakthrough cases (positive testing among vaccinated persons) much higher anticipated,” Bridget Gorman, dean undergraduates, wrote letter school’s 8,000 graduate undergraduate students. university didn’t specify many breakthrough cases were.

More 12,000 people hospitalized coronavirus Texas, officials prohibited masks vaccine mandates, Gov. Greg Abbott recently tested positive.

“We’re hot spot right now,” said Rice’s president, David Leebron, adding decision move temporarily remote classes made give university time assess results recent testing.

“Having new information concern, people worry breakthrough infections, people children worried around issues, wanted little bit time gather data look carefully,” said.

Hell, look chaos suffering - wearing mask worth damage? 

Similar goes vaccination, understand people hesitating. masks? Really? 2 statistics refer antibody tests vaccinations reported community, mean private households. figures exclude individuals hospitals, care homes and/or institutional settings.   think 90%+ rate they're showing county site 12+ 'at least 1 dose'. Going fully vaccinated only, closer 81%, I'm math right.

As someone one somewhat similar county (there's ~8 counties 70%+ fully vaccinated folks 200k+ people), pretty similar here. first cases church since returned in-person May - couple &lt;12 kids tested positive, contact traced alerted families kids Sunday School, families near service (using livestream recording).

Viruses directly benefit, adaptive sense, killing us making us sick. anything opposite, since virus hurt us anything we're going vaccinate otherwise mitigate against. China's vaccine shit though.

Also, it’s piece fabric. Grow up! GA is. Almost stores signs standard language they're responsible risks associated contracting covid-19 premises walk around maskless... personally tried futilely boycott businesses put signs out, them...

An estimated 94.2% adult population England, 93.2% Wales, 89.1% Northern Ireland 93.5% Scotland **would** tested positive COVID-19 antibodies week beginning 26 July 2021.

PS: know protests France clearly 100%. Yep, people trying hear that. also think ridiculous people claim reducing stopping infection never goal, hospitalizations deaths. That's utter nonsense. Stopping spread preventing illness absolutely goal. one know like ""as long die, I'm fine whatever happens."" books rule!  sister NURSE Washington REFUSES get vaccine. 

She care infected treating patients, *their* health *their* responsibility, hers. 

She's bitching non-stop Facebook want mandate vaccines. 

She fucking selfish. infection rate, stronger infection rate specifically vaccines. Symptoms could also become stronger, would random. might get something worse current Delta, might get something milder.

For example, take look data here:
nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global

This chart displays mutations various variants came be.

It seen Alpha variant started appear mutate vaccines rolled Delta variant took vaccines freely available everyone. seems extremely likely virus responding vaccines sense there's favorable mutation variant get defenses mutation likely live capable infecting people, mutations can't. Extrapolating this, think plausible think virus capable mutating creating new variants responding vaccines.

Technically vaccines could even make mutations happen faster randomizing symptoms every time. many people, hope optimism thing help get pain associated restrictions. need believe temporary, sake mental health ""Antivaxxer"" means different things everyone.

There's plenty unvaccinated people getting vaccinated even now. think conversations valuable there's LOT fence post sitters. Covid would evolutionary pressure become less lethal made likely spread. Covid relatively lengthy period infectiousness presenting symptoms, pressure become less lethal reduced. Delta perfect example this, it’s overtaken variants yet it’s also lethal are.  Mask recommendations deceptive - figured early ensure hospitals didn’t run masks. mean, looking run toilet paper… people would hourded masks respiratory devices hospitals would SOL. 


Efficacy oversold - cdc talking points = vaccines massively effective COVID early variants, never sure transmission rates. 


Their bungling Delta pisses - fact decided track hospital-based breakthrough cases pathetic. people thinking, war mode meaning anything one side says side exact opposite. issue right children public schools. say mask up, spread out, test regularly. one side says ""no cannot make child wear mask"" side says ""you wear mask, teachers take experiment vaccine even prevent transmitting virus kid"". Neither position makes fucking sense unless accept society war absolutely nothing public health anymore.

Compromise thing works. Wear mask, distance yourself, get tested. Forced vaccines refusal follow safety measures obviously completely irrational known virus, war. I'm curious see one get go-ahead. 3 dose vaccine produced sub-convalescent NAb titres phase 1/2 trial. sight source education? NH reputation shit public schools. surely officials know deliberately hiding numbers sewing mistrust. Looks like Chicago's getting head start. Masks mandatory indoors starting today ??? various vaccine mandates already implemented (my work one). schools (a friends experienced this) waited last year students moved onto campus dorms within next 2 days moving informed students would online learning throughout semester wouldn’t refund cost room board regardless chose stay campus not. makes sense though huge elderly population here. bad vaccination rates are, elderly still par rest nation… meaning inflate numbers states bad worse Alabama. makes sense they’d younger. I’m ready move another country. Even countries highest vaccination rates world experiencing delta outbreaks right now, isn’t covid-free place they’re living life like it’s 2019. no, walked back texas comments - delta fatal, really add said cool. way most/all/other viruses operate too? breakthrough aid virus treatments? test sample. son tested. major hospitals Atlanta, GA ( Including Children's Health Care Atlanta ) sent medical spokesperson outdoor event yesterday Mercedes Benz stadium live-streamed FB. talked bit bad particular hospital soon going forcing make hard decisions provide healthcare scenario.

And saying FB responses chilling. People flat calling liars. usual anti-covid responses. Chilling ... absolutely chilling.  Yes, true. kids older maybe forgetting anxiety provoking early years are. (Also fwiw Canada many—not all—of preventable risks mitigated). always complicated personal decision baby right Covid adds risks pregnancy infancy, really hard predict. That’s hopeful, remember needed vaccine half population wouldn’t take it. makes think people start helpful now? need 90% vaccinated point, large portion world doesn’t even enough shots go around.

Breakthrough cases happen depending age health, issue. Also kids can’t get vaxxed Vaccines absolutely reduced hospitalizations ""only"" 50% (look ratio hospitalizations cases vs. last winter/spring, see mean)

Yeah that's disingenuous bad-faith way frame data. notice point hospitalizations overwhelmingly unvaccinated. mention R0 delta 2-3 times higher.

I’d curious see study that. oxygen, treatments, vaccine. virus that’s already rapidly mutating become infectious potential become deadly, like 1918. It’d devastating. that’s great makes lot sense! Thank you!  hardcore opponents coronavirus vaccination — group say they'll never get one — tend older, whiter Republican unvaccinated Americans still persuadable, according analysis Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus  Probably option ever giant new building footprint have. much sunk Covid loves Brian Kemp. leadership however. keep people stay angry fearful. easy say ""see Democrats? They're reason angry fearful."" shit they've pulling 70 years.  disgusting is… August 2020 RV park. owners friends come visit, visibly sick. None got tested, bug.

The staff got sick tested Covid positive.

July 2021, vaccinated son (who server restaurant) got sick. tested flu strep. negative. urgent care doc refused request Covid test fever.

My guess is, speculation admit, asymptotic cases reason test. Others refuse test myriad reasons. see reported case counts legitimate statistic. profits one subsidize other. see happening state wide mandate even liberal states US.

I see private businesses requiring masks masks schools, political party survive restriction party 2022 elections. rapidly increasing vaccinations (over million day), vaccine booster shots next month partial protection people get COVID, mask mandates, vaccination mandates, situation much better Christmas.

Those good points, think people careful making optimistic visions covid. pessimistic side better.

Remember people US optimistic spring vaccinations going solve everything. Masks went trashcan on. Well, happened?

The pandemic takes new turns time. might new bomb Christmas season waiting, hit harder take nonchalant approach now. confess immunology never strong suit. Basically, antibodies developed cells called B cells. B cells developing, undergo series mutations specific part DNA helps randomly create candidate antibodies. candidate antibodies displayed surface cell,And buy antigen presented, best sellers allowed mature start making actual antibodies.

If bunch circulating antibodies make, simply buy antigen neutralize it. never allow get developing B cells.

This Rh negative expectant mother given infusion antibody Rh positive blood. prevents developing antibody response Rh positive blood doesn’t kill baby.

I’m sorry wasn’t really good explanation, perhaps somebody stronger immunology better job did. Based data NYT, NYC around 57% fully vaccinated? sounds low me. so, that's lower Miami-Dade much lower San Francisco. seem high enough tamp eventual Delta surge. believe children several states, included, going back school next week week after.

Charter care. Charter thinks working office supercedes legitimate concerns. Tom Rutledge care employees, kids, die suffer long lasting effects covid. get car accident way office easily could sign home, fail get timely treatment bc ICU beds full. 

Tom Rutledge cares control putting butts seats bc ""CoRpOrAtE CulTUrE.""

Fuck. know anti-vaxxers looking convinced? rest us still need information. delusional still delusional, rest us better informed. instead saying, Vaccine required, cancel? almost if, one wants actually use vaccine good. ""overwhelmingly"" unvaccinated UK, best data. Fully vaccinated currently account 35% hospitalizations partially vaccinated additional 20%. (Source: Yes, get high highly vaccinated population, figures suggest even despite high vaccination, cases triple next months - easily could - still see hospitals getting overrun. 


I saying vaccines work - ""bad faith"" reading post. Please read carefully, said: ""Vaccines absolutely reduced hospitalizations."" point work, simply enough allow full return normalcy. controversial? something puzzling debate around vaccinations, particularly US - questioning whatsoever idea vaccines absolute god-send deliver us evil earns endless litany ire, despite mounting evidence multiple studies multiple countries vaccines simply perfect Delta. necessary sufficient return normal.

EDIT: lol, provide NYS site showing form letters current click little arrow. lol, classic. expect see vaccinations 12s become available? I'm part time tutor would really like see student's faces funny faces make lol. I've heard say fall kind optimistic, would deep winter could expect EUA year done? Right. That's hate people act like economy damaged people complaining nothing. Like know economy game people right? Like grocery prices shooting up, supply chains disrupted, everything online hurts people, damage economy literally pushing people 3rd world countries starvation. CBT work try IFS. Yes, certainly safe. previous vaccine long gone system time get new one; there's conceivable mechanism could interact. different taking one drug switching different one (you often make sure old drug gone system starting new one).  vaccinated dad recently tested positive covid far mild tickle throat little bit nasal congestion. 


Those symptoms guarentee Conservatives although rhetoric huge part problem visible. tragedy also lies within black community vax rates lowest all. two group polar opposite things come together anti-vax.  Yeah unfortunately long covid going exist future even vaccinated folks. However, already know chronic fatigue syndrome existed covid likely due viruses affects people similar ways long covid. never worried chronic fatigue syndrome - eventually long covid. myocarditis quite common infected Covid Rumoured mass nurse strikes next week week half live (hint: big province Canada).

The unknown vaccines mandates appease healthcare unions enough scale back threat strike. free, safe effective vaccine available… mean obvious answer don’t care public’s wellbeing People really blaming getting difficult science wrong. People blaming outright lying. 

It took long say masks effective, COVID airborne. second believe stupid actually believe masks ineffective viruses (doctors would taken masks long ago case!) know COVID spread air. virus identified outside Wuhan enough evidence spreading air.  
They likely said things ensure massive demand masks immediately, people panic. 

More recently, oversold efficacy vaccines, vaccines important tool fighting COVID rightfully want maximize number people get vaccinated. 

In opinion, criticisms things exactly correct. Science especially medicine always pay attention ethics fields -- ""Don't lie"" one basic principles group whose entire purpose supposed disseminate truth.  
Why trust someone know liar? Even I'm stupid actually discover truth myself, might inclined believe mistaken conclusions conclusions expert lies. 

There lot good public health organization responses throughout world, take serious issue CDC's, ethical standpoint. frustrating many people turned CDC figurehead ""science"", lot people's trust science whole dragged down. 

Let politicians lie us - ""scientists"" lie us, anti-intellectualism country get rampant...  Yeah Humans social animals, kept away eachother unhealthy wonder people going insane right now. People always want look perfect option can't find one, usually can't, they'll try jerry rig best option perfect mind allow complaints criticism, even someone side.  Next we'll get gamma beta alpha omega hopefully everyone's drunk beer pong games.  extremely negligible

damn good thing got someone information future, huh? zero evidence support statement. Please link research showing that. Especially Afghanistan, vaccine mask manadates popular, continue decrease popularity longer continues. Neither comment thanks playing Vaccinated breakthrough CFR UK 30-50 1/3,000 Delta. comparison average annual mortality risk age group something like 1/300. increase all-cause mortality year 10%.

Remember breakthroughs semi-rare; UK data vaccines reduce 9-fold. one-month gap doses much lower wane faster, booster take factor 9.

Without vaccination 9-fold protection infection goes away also (in UK data) 3.5x likely die test positive.

The training immune system got vaccine still helps breakthroughs, joke. idea breakthroughs always mild absolutely false.  that's without even worrying 30-fold higher risk unvaccinated.

[UK [age Isn’t astrologic sign? That’s good point. Also lot less obesity.   (Virginia) avoidable though? feel like virus going continue rage seasonal cycles children vaccinated. Definitely CFR mortality rate, I'm reading correctly incidence reported myocarditis pericarditis also per million receive vaccine, respective treated/infected populations I'd think comparison still apples:apples. distinction would inflammations one many higher frequency severe adverse reactions mRNA vaccines, think true.

tl;dr rates effects per 1MM affected population.

I'd interested know misunderstood comment.  Covid never end. thing publics interest it. many freedoms give covid? They’re close personal manner people, wouldn’t want protect public? vaccinated going choose nonzero risk contracting COVID never leaving house. Returning lockdown seem fair. *Vaxxed Effexor entered chat* much Magic Gathering tournament.

And love games.  Let unvaccinated get smoke let vaccinated live lives, dumb. be. sick, worried, stay home. megacorporations large advertising budgets designed get people addicted cigarettes, strong public health messaging smoking bans public smoking relatively new. Smoking decreased lot recent times likely self-limiting problem. really anti-vaxxers opinion. people influencing beliefs gain decidedly not, however. really surprise. (large) company also put return office plans set date anymore.

I'm little annoyed gotten lease started traveling around different places staying temporary housing. came back normal city got new lease return office plans lasted total 2 weeks. minor complaint, still sort sucks would liked visit cities. going spread forever. Pretty much everyone will, eventually, get covid whether they're fully triply vaxxed not. difference vaccinated, outcome will, almost assuredly, much better outcome. everyone vaxxed, we'd still reporting thousands cases day... there'd almost one dying, hospitals would full, we'd living lives normal (until vaccines lower point longer provide adequate protection, course, that's solved booster)

There's use trying stop it. Lockdowns effective purposes containment. virus every country planet massively spreading (with exceptions), there's objective achieved lockdown. can't make go away. create illusion business gives shit

Im picturing cute little masks Vaccine mandates? Why? Vaccine us effective Delta variant, lie people like that? Vaccines change game large majority population vaccinated, case places yet.

Australia plans move less aggressive started population [70% zero-covid countries probably something similar. interesting article, thanks sharing!  recall, states still 30s (fully vaccinated) like Alabama Mississippi. Stupidity isn’t limited political affiliation Except getting vaccinated addictive. runs right first day school. Lovely.  completely random. people test positive months. Unvaccinated people often test positive month also depends CT score arbitrarily decide counts testing positive. like lot indiscriminate licking SC. Stop hating culture!!   throwing there, remember give CBT perhaps antidepressants fair chance well possible. Really hope shit peaks soon,

I feeling going multiple peaks different states affected slowly quickly cause drag months. Vaccine mandates going help past winter. Even every unvaccinated person got vaccinated today, still leaves partially unvaccinated October 2 weeks second dose. 

For focus getting people vaccinated course think slightly higher priority getting people masks. mitigate spread overall regardless vaccination status continue distance mask. 

We keep working vaccination vaccine mandates that’s longer term solution would best immediate mitigation efforts. I'd assume next year it'll included annual respiratory-disease shot. Whether shot desirable spring unknown unlikely.  possible…unless already exposed. Perhaps serious consideration given paying trump endorse vaccine  Ok, I'll stay away country guess.

I wish. got covid could get vaccinated, fiance teacher able fully vaccinated then. around entire time due living small apartment get covid. Definitely not. people care stopped interacting crazies, far tell. problem crazies like 20% population given up. think hope FDA gives authorization, many large healthcare institutions like insurance, hospital systems, etc. make stand Rare lead full icu hospitals begging legislation change. weirdo cult leaders won’t promote vaccines unless got monetary kickbacks so. probably tell someone dumb enough buy fake vaccination card also probably know fill correctly. cat also needs vaccine.

Meanwhile, nurse hospital Hazard, KY runs page swva FB encourages people take vaccine, basically denies COVID puts allll kinds lies false information. bragged yesterday granted religious exemption vaccine hospital. comes eastern Kentucky hospitals made clear hospital staff would getting vaccine lose jobs.  


Why heck seem like one cares anymore?  Funny said last christmas it'd July year???  Unvaccinated people bad

People kill millions second hand smoke drinking-good, encouraged socially acceptable thought read article Delta able infect got original Alpha variant again, due mutation. mean. I'm dummy, I'm well aware they'd pass costs me, really much problem waivers going away.

If vaccinated, risks high (especially among 65 crowd overwhelming majority covered private insurers) I'm sure COVID treated differently influenza illness insurance standpoint.

Most COVID costs coming unvaccinated point. I'll take risk pocket little become breakthrough case hospitalized pick larger share bill unvaccinated people.


And get wrong. want universal tax payer funded health care US. rules current game we're playing mind decision health insurers one bit. Hispanic Black vaccination _rates_ per week slightly higher white Republicans. 

But percentage actually vaccinated still lower. still hitting minority populations harder (except Asian-Americans vax fiends).

If actually killing base, they'd 100% scapegoating mode, denial touch scapegoating. Antivaxers think that? ones know think everything fine made up. recovered get least one shot mRNA vaccine highest measured antibody levels. one links above.

I'm sure looking numbers this. still minorities getting worst it. 

News cameras follow white people, that's see news. One interesting takeaway epidemiologists like Osterholm saying typical cloth masks paper masks enough slow Delta. donning high-filtration N95 equivalents, even kids schools. runs counter typical opinion public health experts (who may fear trigger run N95's needed medical settings). don’t understand. It’s going super spreader event. high vaccination rate guarantee 30% vaccinated state fair. technically correct - best kind correct! revise statement clearly reflect intent.

But really sucks much everyone gave caring part manage pandemic got vaxxed. get it, elated receive vaccine ""get right back normal"" too... went back restaurants, met friends, even ditched mask awhile.

But cant keep denying reality front us. fantastic vaccines really help keep us safe, fact is, pandemic isnt gone, potential get even worse, personal actions continue contribute situation getting better, worse. Theres real reason anyone NEEDS host/attend big event, pack busy restaurants, jump cruise ship.

That said, bunch states starting adopt SMART health cards that, integrated individual systems function nationwide verification system, accepted globally. remember got downvoted told nut job saying going away even 75% vaccinate. Ever since Iceland, I've parroting yet many posts downvoted deleted misinformation. Yes this! Interesting article global news (Canada)

So even though passed 3 stages clinical testing shown highly effective, I'm guessing still available long time.  Yea response get it’s parents choice mask get vaccinated, governments.

Sorry man, also citizen don’t mask get vaccinated, you’re getting sick return. Quit greedy self-centered. Yeah, pretty expected infants less social interaction exposure new people environments, delays development. question much permanent, probably lot. big problem course lower income education parents already associated slower development, kids may catch up...

It’s literally useless flat shitty journalism. Give us case numbers hospitalizations. Ok said ""like here"", Canada clear.

The price US paying almost thousand deaths per day (7 day avg rising) infected per day (7 day avg).

That something Chinese willing accept (at larger scale, like four times population).

Since last summer I'm pretty sure percentage overall population, Chinese fewer restrictions Americans.

Especially considering majority people ""feel fine* less likely get tested.

Delta one hellish variant seems like screaming wall point. Anti-vaxxers gonna anti-vax. I'm boat. believe science, got vaccine. gone long enough. think I'm willing make sacrifices people selfish put piece cloth vaccinate. I'm going mask less hopefully get anybody immunocompromised sick, get anti masker sick, Even piece cloth helps, least terms slowing spread. may offer full protection wearer still, entire STATES full people acting like pandemic helping. breakthrough case month ago. wrecked 5 days I'm still 100% back normal. think mean people *anywhere* wearing masks. nobody anywhere wearing mask, there's arguably higher risk (or least higher discomfort) everyone wearing masks *in general*, taking restaurant. Y'all need plan covid instead surprised it. covid (mild) - double vaccinated, took precautions could reasonably take. work conference idiot coworker went ao 1000+ gathering work dinner him. everything could reasonably do, covid still broke through. thing could done better simply go career company really needing trip. 18 months quarantine made trip got mild covid. sucks likely transmitted people, everyone circle vaccinated. kids might might get it, hopefuly fine like every illness. 

I guess point - break through, inevitable. actually WANT get mild covid, get immune boost. concerned long covid much symptoms mild. could issue probably long covid related severe disease is.  big chasers never run bullshit justifications snake handling, you? No, telling people get vaccinated instead. He's getting recalled either way

I agree confidence that, please back confidence least voting get bad anxiety indica even sativa hybrid never pure sativa (when find it). Everyone different concerns regarding one size fits mandates. it? I've heard contagious general nothing outside specifically.   Everyone going eligible starting Sept. traditional vaccines developed India &amp; China use dead virus. guess would effective variants body might develop antibodies spike protein, parts virus.

The Covaxin India less effective symptomatic infections mRNA vaccines, 100% effective severe effects AFAIK. Wildfire smoke notably increases risk contracting virus, air quality NorCal pretty bad several weeks. Add amount people displaced, really making tough situation, lot grim. Thx, Dad definitely ask Doctor least. That's fantastic. Last heard mid winter great news.  Ha, good luck. Already ahead anxiety. Nice try Delta. That's probably many people UK far, 47 million people first vaccine dose - 87% over-16s - nearly 41 million - 75% over-16s -  Thx keep getting vaccinated new variants (as long keep working) unvaccinated keep creating new variants world ends? 

Seriously understand caution, frustrating. saw doctor California said quite cases folks coming reasons mandatory Covid test come back positive. guess Delta going push us basic herd immunity areas. Overwhelming majority hospitalized Covid dying Covid point unvaccinated. facts. Tiny relative course, variants effects that. 

I also recall seeing fairly good data early days suggested original Wuhan outbreak likely started much virulent variant virus significantly higher death/complication rate. behaved like original SARS, spreading slowly, killing more. probably fooled Chinese authorities thinking something like SARS, SARS itself. point fairly early new variant split much contagious (sort like Delta signficantly contagious previous variants). variant broke worldwide. 

If turns true, starts fitting troubling pattern. virus seems rapidly mutating (not surprising), mutations successful taking mantle pandemic contagious ones (also surprising). Theoretically, order virus become contagious, may sacrificing disease causing abilities, lead lower mortality rates (which may seeing Delta already). points scenario many hinted at, Covid becoming seasonal disease circulates along similar lines influenza. I'm looking distance options. term begun required decisions May. may option point. Right, mask recommendation Delta tracking is, believe, absolutely ""ends justify means"" kind deal. 
It's kind thing want see politicians, group that's representing science.

By tracking breakthrough infections less, looks like vaccines effective preventing infection. 

The conversation vaccine=no mask required referring overselling vaccine efficacy though.  
We knew various sources point countries better vaccination rates facing COVID surges, breakthrough infections happening rates negligible. teachable moment. virus teaching us won’t survive lesson. would think many lawyers would fight school, free charge take gov Satan down. Generally, health conditions. Agreed, idk wtf redditors think half time, like come back real world, it’s video game lock every one in, doesn’t work way, cause issues, financially physically.  many times anti vaxxers need hear “only unvaccinated dying hospitalized” fucking get whats actually happening az vaccine? ist getting approved? geographic area.

My point was, profit driven. done COVID rampaging greater rate ever.

They afraid universal healthcare much were, softening policies expected.

The second conversation around universal/single-payer coverage comes back popular consciousness, see change policy make sure maintain business model create flows disinformation muddy waters.   intend return office if/when make us, I'm also telling boss plan want affect bonus.  Used work pet store, tell people buying fish antibiotics personal use definitely thing. one hand though, fish meds flavoring agents coloring that, ingredient list usually already human safe. hand, mostly really common low toxicity chemicals like amoxicillin. mostly encountered people prescribed antibiotic, tryings save money buying form quality controls.

Which bad idea, sure, far cry nuts self-prescribing dangerous experimental stuff. Cheap acne meds vs cheap off-brand chemo. lockdown would kick infections road. Vaccines way go. tested positive covid Monday, Aug. 9th quarantined til tested negative twice yesterday (the 19th). yesterday lost sense smell taste. possible? text negative still symptoms virus? RT?  2.2 million visitors 2019 small town folks? sure? Health Ministry data, nine times serious cases among unvaccinated people age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) among fully vaccinated people age category, little double number serious infections among unvaccinated people under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) among vaccinated age bad news, doctors say, half Israel's seriously ill patients currently hospitalized fully vaccinated least five months ago. 60 years old comorbidities. seriously ill patients unvaccinated mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly. Didnt massive event? gonna get official word boosters J&amp;J? feel awful decision take ""2nd tier"" vaccine little data they're providing it. known would like would waited Pfizer instead getting available immediately. Ethically, always feel need everyone, matter much idiot they've been, resources scarce, that's things get tricky, see priorities coming play, like treating sick child sick elderly person. minimum, see unvaccinated people get good facilities. family member accident something needing bed? want us lying floor hall someone ample access free vaccine taking good equipment, especially odds might good treatment won't. 

And even *like* saying that, don't...but dark place society goes crisis. happened Plague various events. starts turning ""every man himself."" Variant could first come anywhere time, speed mutation spread come later depend several different factors also fighting variants. look time mutations Delta started occur coincide well general availability vaccines. also coincide well fact Pfizers efficacy gone low (39% according Israel), implying Delta variant optimized mutations Pfizer vaccine. Look dots chart, new discovered mutation.

Delta mutations could've milder version itself.

For example Delta variant could've discovered 1921 moon, matter actually started mutate spread fast. Yes - hand, incredible science understands many detailed molecular mechanisms, starting target specific processes. Might take while, though.

But, end, obvious: reduce risk contagion via reasonable distancing masks vaccines. Vaccines get better time. Peak? even fall yet NY. would really nice facts figures meant something people hesitate get vaccine.

Instead bolsters argument ""see what's point still get virus!"" Yeah issue WA State. There’s ton buildings indoor things fair though. Plus it’s literally shoulder shoulder crowd arenas even outside weekends (midway, busy food streets) SF masked since April last year. likely also contributed low infection rates right now. likely combo unconfirmed cases, hospital overflow, people hesitant seek medical care non-covid illnesses, deaths related pandemic's economic effects Rural anywhere may well Alabama. Source: live rural adjacent part California. important consent always important want people forced take take it. argue might want it, still favor people deciding choose take without force coercion

This disease preventable vaccine masks prevent happening. Countries high vaccination rate also large amount people hospital, also different capacity may different culture different believes societal standards

There science behind choose strengthen immune system well stay healthy rather taking vaccines drugs, true acknowledge basic science, focus types rather vaccine drug based solutions hating big city liberals ""ruining America""

Health insurance impacts might tipping point. Reposting reply linked wrong macaque study  scheduled annual heart attack later year definitely honest data bullshit 99.99999% PR campaign. 60%

I expect better you, NPR. one's making articles surges countries/regions actually highly vaccinated--Iceland get half much attention--I wonder is? /s sure downvoted. cases long Covid could absolutely permanently. effects could due nerve damage organ damage. also resistant existing antibodies spreads easily. contradiction?

I say would get less fatal, get fatal; said would get fatal there's something else gain. clearly see two big gains likely related fatality rate. Assuming rate exposure vaxxed unvaxxed (that's huge that, admittedly, even fully comfortable making), graph nicely showing breakthroughs potential far less ""rare"" people keep claiming if/when Delta takes community many/most/all people meaningfully exposed fall (?).

Remember, CDC estimated 1 3 Americans already covid point, IIRC. since pandemic started, Delta future transmissible strains out-compete Delta entered chat. Sydney locked 8 weeks. COVID still spreading there. Unless China does, can't contain it. It’s huge 2,126,551 attendance 9 ten days 2019 it’s largest state fair attendance per day country. possible weather it, take account burnout heaping onto healthcare system may break places. certainly breaking medical staff. What’s terrifying sounds like virus still room become infectious. might want ask someone /r/datahoarder would interested backing hosting them. I've looked videos recently hard find 💯

Vaccination best protective measure take right now. Followed closely masking public. you’re high risk avoid unnecessary crowds careful indoor HVAC ventilation might circulate virus. guy went college bragged Facebook kid’s school isn’t masking instant unfriend places still does, due low vaccination rates. preventable part.

I know preventable... Delta contagious. One way another almost everyone going get near future. thing try slow enough hospitals larger economy grind halt.

Schools might end achilles heel. matter hard try everywhere else kids vaccinated spreading school putting homes almost everywhere people going mask home.

Masks social distancing best shot slowing nothign prevent everyone getting infected. (imo)

In California schools requiring masks importantly set protocols kick someone tests positive. Many students get quarantined stay home 10 days even get negative test. kids showing symptoms get test negative, return sooner covid develop slowly test positive several days they're choose route assumes contact known infected, passed virus test negative show symptoms almost 7 days. This, hopefully make less likely kid come back keep spreading even negative test symptoms. I'm learning go pick kid keep home 10 days. symptoms contact known positive. 

That 2-12 vaccine can't get fast enough. agree. However, don’t “kind of” wish it. I’ve ignorant, knuckle dragging, anti vaxxer bullies. Ashland surprisingly high vaccination rate! rest Jackson County shit show though. exception vaccine status ACA. that's want going take congress. needs stop. 

You became health care provider reason that's help save lives....you without prejudice....

The country divided t-man need division this.

Do ask best ability without regard race, color, religion, vax status, insurance, etc, etc, etc... CDC's approval process tests vaccines pretty bad. vaccine test US nearly instant approval others take months legal battles. Yeah it’s 90% plus fully vaccinated, even one dose better 0. It’s binary.

I’m pregnant lady, hoping hold give birth. husband vaccinated works home, I’m stay home parent. risk vaccine seemed higher possibility getting covid.

I think also case lot parents. Hesitant parents similar situation low exposure felt ok waiting bit cases going down. But, delta affecting kids school starting back changed things . Alabama doctor announced Oct. 1, longer treating unvaccinated patients covid. Sadly, made really happy. still 30k infections per day. stop pretending anything except endemism going happen anywhere?

Patient told vaccination required transplant. refused get it. won’t get simple vaccination, doctors expect follow necessary drug regime prevent organ rejection?  Makes sense, knew that, reason today thinking excess fatality count meant ""extra deaths could prevented handled virus better."" Thanks taking time! Guys, solution enforce vaccination, way. outbreak smallpox Yugoslavia, 1972. government quickly imposed martial law quarantine vaccinated entire country, 18 million people matter weeks, halting outbreak good. Vaccine weapon, problem world full assholes douchbags. agency captivity. cut edge. think could done shit stupid fucks gotten vaccinated. yes, absolutely. got (breakthrough case). person got also vaccinated. meeting later learned one person it, one got tested. symptoms. (i never developed symptoms. even one.) nobody else got tested symptoms either. know, every single one could gotten it, nobody would ever know! visit Canada though, think, unless that’s changed. spreading anyway, let spread rest stupid friends family. Children born pandemic yet potty trained. Yes. mostly young males. investigating one fatality (not sure results). usually self resolving needs minor treatment issue. mean, there's one thing gotta love America, least they're Americans once. say ""What mess!"". feds step say fund whatever unfunded state?  feel like editor really let wording title published. 

It seems really unlikely patient, go onto ECMO, person calling around ECMO themself. Hopefully October. Pfizer track submit EUA end September. 4-6 week turnaround FDA. Vaxxed Prozac'd. I'm ready. Even Trump got vaccine!! dont get either. gonna need boosters take away initial vaccines poorer nations. dont see happy herd immunity ending anywhere globe. Yeah, unfortunately, 2-3/10 american adults children 12 unvaccinated 350 million Americans that's lot wiggle room highly transmissible delta variant. would dead got door. I'm armed liberal vet. I’ve trouble depression anxiety whole life, obviously intensified isolation. However, getting COVID clear shift emotions mental health. reported CDC got add Coronavirus page site.

I appreciate everyone’s concern already see professionals mental health. people actively trying get nurses/docs refuse vax fired/shunned? hands deck reddit actively pushing this? I'm starting come around point view can't get line. High chance dying beats high chance dying every time. unknowns either me. Let's face it. We're gonna live virus rest lives. thing might next common cold flu. However worse aspects. Unfortunately make sense. try take the... we'll call optimistic? view here: Yea Israel. Realistically know surge would happened regardless, feel like missed chance give grandmother hug months ago careful. would CDC even able estimate asking one centralized database? Excess fatality meaning 1 million people die average year year 1.5 million people 500 k excess mortality. Russia documented 175K deaths Covid also 500k extra deaths occurred year (outside norm) idea caused it-maybe died home street hospital testing done. 

Often pandemic noted true death toll noted plus excess mortality often later attributed pandemic. makes sense right? Like always million deaths pandemic hits get bunch extra deaths something (like pandemic) probably caused it. great, still 5-6 weeks useful late.

And feel people delayed catch actually fully immunized fuel ""vaccines work"" crowd.  build million ICU beds, still need proper amount medical staff man bed…  still catch spread COVID vaxxed. Wear damn mask. That’s delta became dominant strain shit happened man. parent said COVID spread preventable which, point US, not. mean try COVID going spread regardless. Cases way South America right now. think everyone South America started social distancing wearing masks properly?

Nice job making political. Yeah cdc doesn’t approve tests vaccines, FDA does. odd thing I've processed issues required working dose decreased. Maybe I'm older, slow metabolizer comes chemical, pretty neat psychopharmacology all.

I'm glad found something works you. Finding right chemical individual needs difficult sometimes, change brings nice. vaccinated healthcare workers breakthrough cases studied ended long covid

I mean, true, also true whopping sample ...39 breakthrough infections hospital workers. 

More research needed, way small really say much prevalence.

Beyond this, really need careful talking ""long COVID,"" used describe incredibly broad range different symptoms. want minimize long-lasting COVID symptoms (which absolutely occur), feel like lots folks around treat inevitably permanent, debilitating condition...when seen data indicate that's case vast majority instances God forbid Covid cases come in. million own. situation much better Christmas

Yes, news media continue make sound like national crisis. **We've got best healthcare system world!** 



^^^besides ^^^most ^^^other ^^^developed ^^^countries ^^^including ^^^some ^^^much ^^^poorer ^^^than ^^^ours ^^^:D One small subset Democratic party low vax rates. fixed.

However, entire Republican party low vax rates. NJ cases go much today it’s steady increase past weeks? thought done sub back May hooray, again. shit never going away it? Feeling completely hopeless right now. started get life back summer. Guess fun lasted. counting year's end No, that's Econo...line. lot people conflate two statements makes talking COVID illness versus COVID pandemic pretty difficult. can't shut country population US month half. lie say vaxxed not? ""must....save.... morons... from.... selves....."" interview B2B side. Ended turning job. Real boomer ass mentality communications company. pretty much 100% guarantee virus mutating every single vaccinated (and unvaccinated) person gets infected RNA replication (and pretty much nucleic acid replication) error proof. SARS-CoV-2 genome around 30 kilobases RNA-dependent-RNA polymerases error rate 1.5 x 10e-3 bp-1, around 45 mistakes every genomic RNA replication. also happens unvaccinated people, anywhere virus replicating. important way lower chances variant concern limit number parameter space SARS-CoV-2 genome gets sample. best way prevent replicating, best way vaccination. guess semantics around word ""mutate"" insignificant SNP effect virus people mean say ""mutant"". god isn’t protecting fake virus? sniffles? Well stay home call church ask start prayer chain. Don’t believe science refused vaccine? God forbid take monoclonal antibodies science produced. don’t know what’s them. addressed anyone here. responding idiots crying admitted. whose families doubt try file wrongful death suit afterwards. Yep.

We're really sure why, theories, looks like two doses mRNA vaccine help long covid. he's dealing lingering symptoms, might help. Talk doctor, course. Check Dad Grass website. Sounds like right alley. IQ scores factor age. Compared babies previous years scored lower. hell IQ test baby real question  Democrats real interest showing spine. That's obvious since Gore. either apathy design, years, think might apathy. Purely anecdotal, got back road trip CA southern Oregon coastal region. *Very few* people saw wearing masks, point changed plans ate meals exclusively room. 

Not surprised hear news, sadly. Sure, going mandate vaccination, modify lives make things safer unvaccinated/maintain hospital capacity. doesn’t, point becomes late f progress we’ve made fight.  I've heard happening lot people, able enjoy cannabis long time suddenly starts giving anxiety, paranoia panic attacks. I'd like know happens. late July. I'm pissed now. worried, little scared, taking precautions, getting vacinated, I'm fucking pissed. That’s I’m betting too. It’s pretty annoying every time cases drop peak people act like that’s impossibility somehow due testing capacity. 

Schools wildcard might make drop gradual “plummeting” we’ve seen countries, kind extremely widespread transmission isn’t sustainable long much Florida’s population infected, vaccinated, point. extent problem US. Cobb County? not, that's weird coincidence. :)

Edit: 11 year old 13 year old Cobb. 13 year old got Close Contact alert Tuesday. They've week. I'm tired them. never get vaccinated allow get vaccinated. either make life bureaucratically difficult unvaccinated effectively prohibits choose take vaccine job (and also cut benefits), use physical force vaccinate unwilling get themselves. mention patient vaccinated not.  


I'm betting not. think enforce vaccination. allowed challenge it. Flu mutates lot faster virus. Here's latest case/death charts South neighbors, they've gotten relatively lightly date. checking charts, may making now.

South Carolina currently #10 weekly per-capita I’m dreading long term fallout flu bro propaganda. It’s like heart disease diabetes contagious. Covid’s clotting cardiovascular complications make even mild cases bad health care system. Hope people least support M4A UBI enhanced disability ADA provisions workplaces. really money. symbol power. want buzzing metropolis, ghost town. vaccine clearly made immortal, obviously Fauci lied. /s  Keep fighting!!! Given first year largely staying home maybe bit optimistic pandemic timeline first, choice actually makes perfect sense me. Actually mom older kids lockdown reminded mat leave (except better sleep without cute baby). world falling apart, that’s pretty ongoing. Either want kids don’t. reminder author spreading almost misinformation Chinese vaccines keep perspective mind read find strange news articles trying link outbreaks countries efficacy Chines vaccines, places like Israel US.  Masks - fine. 

Vaccine - great. 

Anxiety - eh, always anyway..

More lockdowns? - Oh please god hope never need those. Easter 2024 gonna lit mother 65 diagnosed qualifying condition? may approved get early, that’s currently recommendation rest us.  Lmaooooooo meant would retrocede Alpha Strain, mean could become less infectious become deadly immunity evading, like trading one thing another. ‘Flattening curve’ remember phrase &amp; clapping 👏 “Frontliners”. Feels like lifetime ago. know what's cheaper buying counterfeit vaccination card? 7 year old daughter going back school, 100% person. Masks required thankfully, still, I'm terrified there's literally nothing do. Outdoors? burden poor choices health insurance industry.

What? That's like saying burden crime police. didn’t specify Easter. 😂  study claiming that's net total Sturgis related cases.

It's looking single chain contact tracing.

How many people caught COVID Sturgis never even talked contact tracers? exactly crowd keen government intervention. 66% bad considering trials conducted delta peak India, still 100% effective moderate severe disease. 

The US need vaccines probably even apply approval, anyone who's willing get vaxed gotten jab months ago. Don’t forget thank local Evangelical this.  kind think near future hospitals full, non vaxed 12 without legitimate medical reason vaccinate last line medical care.... Many people US (and probably places too) thoroughly spoiled truly cannot fathom scenario includes hospital health care provider saying “sorry, no.” Can’t help you.” can’t imagine world someone experiencing great pain sent home told see doctor morning, hospital already full sicker people. that’s already happening. Here's latest case/death charts Mississippi, running 7-day current #2 weekly per capita deaths (Lousiana takes top Mississippi burning - reality stranger fiction. That's good breakdown. also shows that, beyond Manhattan, NYC much different rest US's large cities terms vax %. Smokers pay insurance. could treated way COVID vaccine. course isn’t.

Instead, says see opportunity relax health insurance’s existential threat universal healthcare. 

Early pandemic idea floated many places around country insurers leapt quelling fears high cost care hospitalization offering full coverage COVID treatment.

Now hospitalization rising faster ever, 200% contagious strain disease, ceasing full coverage waivers. It’s shameful. seeking profits poor year paying care insured.

Healthcare right, shouldn’t deal kind BS get treatment need, regardless whether raging pandemic not. especially raging pandemic affecting every single community worldwide.  Got it! helpful information. wish knew immunity prior infection works, come time suppose. I’m mainly trying figure explain husband I’m considering vaccinated since wary distrustful messaging surrounding vaccine. 

It’s sad state affairs bad information running rampant. Im vaxxed waxed. this? left part america vaccinated, don’t give shit happens people chose vaccinated.  Bless godspeed ever stop taking Effexor. Worst weaning I've ever experienced unbelievably good looking wonder resort crime sex. It’s sad, wife back states first time 2 years baby meet family first time start telling family members want see us baby, need vaccinated. It’s worth risk little one. people tired want want information conflicts pandemic over. 

The pandemic little risks long COVID since pandemic ending mean COVID go away. lower risk long COVID highly vaccinated populace US currently highly vaccinated needs change. COVID still cause permanent lung damage see easily communicable diseases though. That's enough try avoid costs, feel worth risk do. Yup country damn screwed up. Every. Single. Thing. political issue dad. honestly believes example bomber guy D.C. put place Democrats get folk's attention away Afghanistan. 

The human mind consume much news seems like breaks. I'm nervous wreck day see can’t win system want everyone else lose, that’s way stay currently are.   would concerns be? According [article](/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4pw85/a_covid19_patient_in_oklahoma_needed_a_bed_the/) several days ago, hospital Boise ended taking patient Tillamook closer beds. likely does.

A stronger immunity (more antibodies) would likely lead lower viral loads event infection. Lower viral loads associated lower spread. infection less likely first place strong immunity.  Iceland 90% vaccinated, hospitals still filling up. declared state emergency there. months long nationwide lockdown everyone wearing KN95 masks better,

If people wear them, wear correctly, even best masks world anything. drove Oregon yesterday, ton ""Unmask Oregon"" bumper stickers, passive-aggressive signs business doors, nobody wearing masks. fucking mess.

Start office pot “Survivor”. Whoever’s still alive holidays splits money! Every time cough blow nose without mask put dollar jar! Challenge them. they’re stupidly confident confidently stupid step right up.

no /s make clear, think everyone vaccinated, period. comparing people eligibility transplant list acute illness apple oranges, same. 
 Triage triage - *the assignment degrees urgency wounds illnesses decide order treatment large number patients casualties.*  
 We don’t weed people line care stupid don’t get vaccinated, much times part feels should.  
It shitty, scared kids young, even though risk low.  think back mom terminal ER ER visit ventilator, horribly was, thinking other's may living that.  I’m mad idiots cost other’s lives. help stop spread people? someone 60, personally need see lot data recommendation CDC get booster.  Didn’t Biden allocate funds cover this? Apparently Nurse Practitioner argued Facebook refusing vaccine... Sigh... driven Canadian government policy industries regulate expected fully vaccinate workforce. still don’t expect trickle beyond I’m hopeful  Delta wave plummet pretty fast. Maybe end sight.

It takes days get sick, hospitalizations plateau soon, although 17k hospital stress system cases resolve.   guidance ""leak"" article based withdrawn, genius. medical ethicist it. Let Union County care since want part Idaho badly. Orlando smells like sewer everytime Ive stepped plane. Locals used cant smell it.
And yes floaters water- hold water glass light. missing piece. "" living home"" going work/school bringing home?

I'm saying let's live bubbles, someone home compromised health, family needs vigilant  take ton Idaho’s medical emergencies normal conditions, hospital size proximity. live Pasco county Florida. School District emailed saying require students staff quarantine unless symptoms.  Why'd think people mandated vaccination? country doesnt require it, stupidly high covid vaccination rates 

Do think ethical force people potentially blurry line mandatory vaccinated young ages differing risk levels? (My country vaccinated 16). 

Do think mandatory vaccination actually work people need vaccination (I'm talking middle aged/older aged person tell make force)?

My 3rd points probably biggest thing. Unless gonna send people guns round. Tough luck enforcing mandatory medical procedures cant enforce masks. They’re ones come belligerent screaming hoax. 

For real though, seems like we’re good job far. OHSU keeps date tally vaccinated unvaccinated patients kind data really important understanding vaccine efficacy. think posted update morning. comment instantly reminded science reason hasn’t gotten antivaxx morons... maybe threat soul crushing medical debt will.  first paragraphs basically weeks June July, workers Maine factory making one America’s popular rapid tests Covid-19 given task shocked them: take apart millions products worked hard create stuff garbage afterward, Andy Wilkinson, site manager Abbott Laboratories, manufacturer, stood rows employees announce layoffs. company canceled contracts suppliers shuttered plant making test, Illinois, dismissing work force 2,000. “The numbers going down,” told workers demand testing, saying wasn’t fault. “This virus cases U.S. plummeted spring, Abbott’s Covid-testing sales. now, amid new surge infections, steps company took eliminate stock wind manufacturing proving untimely — hobbling efforts expand screening highly contagious Delta strain rages across 15-minute antigen test, BinaxNOW, soaring people return schools offices. Yet Abbott reportedly told thousands newly interested companies cannot equip testing programs near future. CVS, Rite Aid Walgreens locations selling at-home version, Amazon shows shipping delays three weeks. Abbott scrambling hire back hundreds workers. Well, yeah. infections overall asymptomatic, pushed even higher vaccines. people getting tested, would cause drastic undercount even CDC adequately tracking breakthrough cases anything ever confirmed Russia?   unfortunately unlike them, we’re kind monsters would let someone drown lung fluid, matter obnoxious are. Also, fair chunk anti-vax community southern areas immigrant migrant enclaves issues getting info/resources trusting government variety valid reasons. See also: measles outbreak couple years ago. 

Yes, absolutely frustrating dangerous though. never frequent smoker gave crushing anxiety 50% time...

Parties like dice roll... Evens: ""Duúuuuude!! Put track again!"" Odds: ""Where smackson go?? minute ago"" (smackson, mile away already, foot: ""Omygodomygod, walk... poison? spike acid? Can't go home... they'll know I'm there..."" etc..)

The one time great long vacay smoked daily month, awesome! buzz pleasant every time! masks what, double long takes us catch it? Imagine parent region who's taken shit seriously, worn mask, got vaccine, still follows precautions day... kid gets accident needs ICU bed survive... taken mouth-breather spent year denying pandemic even exists finally bite ass, doom child seemingly criminal level selfishness, ignorance, arrogance loud group mouthbreathers. Wow concerning. anxiety continues ramp up, thank answer right. Masks considered choking hazard children 2. give damn families separated. really sad. Also kids can’t get vaxxed pulled daughter school. I’d hate think parents motivated large hospital bill (I wtf would risk life six months kindergarten). No, Omicron Variant Ah, yes, one every fifty five cases die there's nothing worry about! correct that, starting September 20, people 8 months second dose get booster?

Seems bit absurd given US tossing millions doses point. basically puts vaccinated population getting boosters Dec/Jan beyond.

What's bet whether people able get boosters 8 months? whole situation stupid really. hope feel better soon!  mostly permanent *damage* I'm worried get infected. remember reading even mild/asymptomatic cases leave behind scar tissue. said could impacts water quality city reduce amount water need treat.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  partly dig previous governor said kids   professor data scientist, augusta university georgia bad Delta still kills people much transmissable. virus spreads far wide detectable unless get bad symptoms, might kill you. got mild symptoms likely spread it, get tested, alert others.  Unfortunately unless end ICU they're going consider mild case regardless long term problems. 93 year old vaccinated grandma died. Everything really got once. Might marked Covid tested positive also another stroke organs shutting down. think SF's slow little little that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being highly vaccinated AWESOME, esp something like 98% 12-17s vaccinated!

But also people seemed changed behaviors:

It party central month July, masks, lots late nights.

The news delta surge started noticed people wearing masks ALOT more, social circles pulled bit part bars got slightly less crowded. People going inside dinner stopped, etc...

Not everyone course, enough take foot gas pedal.

I'm worried school re-openings, esp elementary schools unvaccinated kids, impact fires close windows due smoke outside. engineers dress pretty terrible anyways, ratty jeans loose shirt norm ""Sending unmasked, unvaccinated kids poorly ventilated classroom like holding world's largest chickenpox party, except instead chickenpox third-leading cause death last year,” said No. child 2. Definitely newborns, enough issues breathing is, good idea try it. son 1.5 we'll probably start practicing next months. understand yet. Send unvaccinated people back line minimum treatment get get trying infect rest us caring even families. Take care people actually matter actively trying stop virus like vaccinated people. I’ve read somewhere mother’s stress pregnancy lower child’s IQ. Could what’s happening here? Yeah….no.

Fully vaxxed basically back normal life. I’m done shit. Even state, behavior night day last year. one going back restrictions sort. Mask mandates maybe, capacity restrictions sort going happen.

Let Southern states low vaccination rates feel hard way. high vaxxed areas seeing high increases hospitalizations it’s time move on.  getting dumb. old. People get sick. People die. That’s life. gotta move on. never conquer this. gotta make life miserable still too! I've blending 1:2 / 1:3 ratio indica /cbd. helped immensely, realising decade smoking weed, straight weed far strong now. blending like wonderful. better increasing alcohol intake going back anti anxiety medication. wish would discovered blend years ago. No, live NYC take subway daily, go office, live life normally, etc. mentioned comment, nobody I’ve close proximity contracted vax. Young women testosterone bravado too. much. /r/Collapse Right? end well desantis?? truly wish simple this. Maybe FDA approval comes through.

But honestly wish kids 5-12 approved soon. reason included ostracized part society. actually Talmud. job needs see shit they’re totally acting like pandemic they’re local govt. Wtf kids? That's dark, bro treat everyone that's living home us infectious individual. compatible human nature economy limited effect. 4 days ago Florida's total deaths (on worldometers) 40,584. Yesterday ended 41,937. That's 1,353 deaths reported 3 days. dream location it!! even can't places, still lot door activity's woul take tbh case COVID-19 general? tested positive last August (had business trip) zero symptoms State's health dept, said, ""With age demographic, seeing 40% asymptomatic surprising"". I'm late 30's.

Delta spreads more... significantly still..... Pfizer. got vax almost 9 months ago. Even though got it, still get booster. I’d get ASAP. somebody bed day Sunday (1 day symptoms appeared) got second dose three weeks ago, didn’t get it. person office day Monday also didn’t contract me. Neither roommates got me, either. sharing food night Monday. live carrier vaccines like J&amp;J AZ also need get nucleus. “Fleeting contact” describe lightning fast transmission Delta variant contact tracers pinpoint CCTV video two people passing resulted covid transmission.

indoors? Whats end game here? kids anti mask parents still lose funding thier school. Youre hurting children. Texas school districts made part dress code. know involved child's school, seems like great idea least pitch. kids unmasked they're in-person school right now. Florida, take note! Gotta look terps driving 1587 deaths fully vaccinated people 187,000,000 fully vaccinated US sounds like correct numerator denominator me. anti-vax people, carrots, sticks. Make can't function society without vaccine. school, work, acceptance businesses restaurants. I'm opposite. take 10 gummy feel nothing. Use .01 grams smoking, I'm nice relaxed. teacher southern state small school. staff 14 know 5 people vaccinated. rest staff gives bullshit reason freedoms. work idiots. jnj started August 12th. Today ends first full week school. Consumerism affects genders. There’s even states higher vaccine rates Israel.  u/enterprisevalue posts incredibly informative stats morning Ontario covid cases/vaccinations etc. stats stole regarding vaccine effectiveness province:

\- Today, per 100k case rates un/partially/fully vaxxed people 9.93 / 4.92 / 1.12 
\- Translated effectiveness rates, fully/partially vaxxed people 88.8% / 50.5% less likely get infected unvaxxed people 
\- Translated effectiveness rates, un/partially vaxxed people 8.9x / 4.4x likely get infected fully vaxxed people 
\- last week, per 100k case rates un/partially/fully vaxxed people 7.93 / 4.92 / 1.12

\- Note ICU data complete ICU patients vaccination status recorded. Today's ICU total database is: 79 ( 67 / 7 / 5 ) un/part/full vax split add on, considering potential wicked side effects, want deal massive hangover time. take easy. It’s exhausting keeping bad thoughts head. don’t know. Keep Goode work can’t last forever. No. also don’t risk contracting cancer smokers care them. spread cancer around grocery store waiting room. end day, one physically suffers choice- outside grieving family course. I'm sure going require masks too. I'm afraid ""vax mask"" lead vaccine hesitancy. So, teachers required vax mask? so, when? Forever? one school nurse say that's pushing for. ""School 9 months year masking flu season anyway""...... true every variant kinda died out. Where??? Vaccinated going hospitals rate, covid killing way. Problem is, me/my area least, antivaxxers stubborn matter present going get vaccine. travel somewhere twice. I'd still prolly tell work got 2 dose one take 2nd day anyway tell need recover side effects. would lie work ask proof thats fault Oregon strictest masks social distancing policies America put many businesses employees bankruptcy.

Are arguing delta increase gone down? cases today yesterday. Maybe they've crested, Delta proves REALLY hard keep bottle. Movin' country,
Gonna eat lot peaches Vaxxed klonopined here. doesn’t ring it… hospitalized patients. sick felt terrible, breathing fine own. treatment waiting hopefully keep hospital entirely. Apparently Oregon pass law years ago *really* rural place -- would burden gas station pay full-time attendant -- legally pump own. gas station signs indicating whether that's case. far place I've run Rome (which literally gas station 100+ mile stretch road) though. get later, possibly die time, get damage top got last time(s), there's hospital bed availability keeping people getting treatments covid relates. That's really immunity works. many mutations virus make keep capable infecting human hosts. read article, I'm still left unclear costs things like Regeneron. vary state insurance company? virtually everyone eligible get vaccinated. would severely reduced spread Covid wouldn’t seeing full ICUs states. Try high CBD strains/CBD vapes. Don’t consume edibles. anxiety/paranoia persists, consider eliminating cannabis completely working meditation practice. Try performing dream checks initiate lucid dreaming. Practice awareness. kids, too, things think - risks. something goes wrong, hospitals, can't get quick enough doctor, first year doctor's appointments - new little one exposed virus go get shots? pregnant puts mom's risk, bring baby seems even risky. hospital's filling up, medical staff totally burned quitting. mom gets covid - still breastfeed? quarantine away baby? There's many unknowns. also pandemic first happened, shelves emptying store... really scary. Supply shortages impact ways really thought first, know what's going on. breastfeed, steady supply formula? stress all, enough time energy keep everything. appreciate feel differently, man seems sort selfish way risky right choose purpose child this. appreciate others see differently. suppose woman working mom, laid-off due pandemic, working remotely now, see would tempting. reason? ease/faster? soon remove lockdown cases rise again. immediately put another lockdown. again...until 1 month 1/2 becomes 8 months, 12 months, two years.

It's gonna work. Lockdowns buy time. used waiting vaccines. vaccines work, lockdown forever. no, option anymore. Testing lots variables, proof number hospitalizations next weeks. 1 million vaccinations yesterday. since July 3. Wasn’t anything serious, annoyance, enough I’m going blindly booster indefinitely Besides everyone else said, another factor tolerance. Weed hits totally different moderate / high tolerance. might need smoke low strength strains body get used get steamrolled. excellent, in-depth article nature.com weeks ago explains exactly mutation might increasing Deltas infectivity rate. fascinating read details whole lifecycle infection, points different attack vectors us.

How coronavirus infects cells — Delta understand it:
The one mentioned (P681R) seems modify virus' furin cleavage site. part protein ""activates"" protein right new virus released infected cell. furin cleavages, infectious.

""Two coronavirus variants, Alpha Delta, altered furin cleavage sites. Alpha variant, initial proline amino acid changed histidine (P681H) ; Delta variant, changed arginine (P681R). changes make sequence less acidic, basic string amino acids, effectively furin recognizes cuts it, says Barclay. “We would hypothesize virus getting even better transmitting.”

More furin cuts mean spike proteins primed enter human cells. SARS-CoV, less 10% spike proteins primed, says Menachery, whose lab group quantifying primed spike proteins yet publish work. SARS-CoV-2, percentage rises 50%. Alpha variant, it’s 50%. highly transmissible Delta variant, group found, greater 75% spikes primed infect human cell."" rapidly yes, compared week ago. Wearing mask really ""huge amounts precaution"" though. making seem like people saying wear Hazmat suit walk around like Bubble Boy. go office pick cord. wearing worst cut shorts, tank top bra cardigan longer shorts. definitely ran CEO. still believe vaccines could greatly reduced pandemic states people actually went got them. far many people refusing them. I’m still trying convince parents get jabbed even dad’s sister ICU. Well we’ve told vaccines wane time.

The higher R0, higher likely Rt given time. Yes. 

I would argue we'll hit endemicity sooner, look UK 90%+ antibodies. runs hosts eventually. higher R0, faster spread, faster endemicity. maybe meds like help people get near normal level functioning allow actually live lives???   Anecdotal, breakthrough case. felt like cold days.  change game large majority population vaccinated, case places yet.

That point - point false dychotomy OP talking exist anymore. Whether completely us. That's society functions. absolutely erradicate disease want to. question whether can, whether will.

As ""completely insignificant health risk"" vaccination brings, inaccurate. know long-term effects regular Covid are, certainly know impact vaccine long term effects people breakthrough cases. Lots kids survived Polio, mean ideal outcome vaccine erradicated it. Dallas County Judge warning parents something data. None data actually addresses questions Flower gives anxiety, vape pens not. Everyone's different. Yip, high they’ve course. kind reducing plateauing. local hospital 2 free ICU beds! .... 2 40 died. businesses particular resilient enough withstand repeated lockdowns governments can't afford bail businesses repeatedly.

Which *precisely* reason every country bar (so far) China abandoned planning abandon zero covid policy. literally cannot without repeated lockdowns, especially infectious variants like Delta rest world board it. Always wait weeks cases become deaths, but, yes, countries may see proportionally fewer deaths wave people vaccinated. 
RemindMe! three weeks. seems reasonable, since first lateral flow already 5 days after, less likely false negative another one soon case sounds good :) people think masks dangerous. can't explain surgeons, sure masks prevent breathing give bacteria (your bacteria breathed mask). Yep, fails, need raise awareness monoclonal antibodies treatments. 
In US, there's website find locations monoclonal antibodies treatments distributed to:  
It's worth knowing places area offering lose time time comes actually need ASAP. 
They're suggesting administered people recently tested positive immunocompromised, even vaccinated. Here's latest FDA criteria: 
The drug actually free people qualify, administration cost insurance probably cover. Here's flyer found info costs treatment:  feel bad this. Compassion worn out.

But first, bravo workers risked much course panic. deserve better. deserve respect.

Secondly, pity children unvaccinated, medical reasons cannot vaccinated.

For aggressively unvaccinated: fuck oxygen breathe. Hospitalization even half peak. He's getting recalled either way. They’re seeing it. That’s problem. They’re seeing trailers, overwhelmed hospitals.

A lot people going week normally. go work, go church, go eat. see friends. play dates kids. Rinse repeat. Fox news isn’t showing overwhelmed hospitals. aren’t showing people gasping air. that’s assuming really watch news all. lot people get news local conservative shock jockeys radio drive work.

As far many people concerned, life literally normal. It’s effects personally actually see what’s going on.

Even though last winters surge still brutal, infection rate Covid time lot lower. lot people never potential exposure, even ones flagrantly ignoring masks social distancing. Delta far infectious though, even vaccines, lot people avoided last year coming face face reality now.

I zero pity people vaccinated point, reality lot people would probably willing get vaccinated actually saw going on. red leaning states, cities, towns, people watch Fox, local news station conservative avoiding addressing covid… aren’t seeing “news” isn’t showing it. people don’t seek news, don’t check sources. watch programs that’s that. That’s source news get.

I think past year half, ever, proven needs sort semblance regulation journalism. shit isn’t acceptable. local news doesn’t report ICUs full, that’s problem. Fox News declares fake vaccines deadly, whatever literal bullshit they’re peddling, that’s okay. People need held accountable actions part reason millions people completely ignorant whats happening around them.  US register applied vaccine database somewhere?

I live developing country, every shot immediately registered government run central database, get electronic QR code certification. saw UK considering exposures sounds bit strange, person entirely asymptomatic? Surely person infectious around 5 days positive test case (since test could made ""late"")? also possible takes long covid patients longer recover others. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission.

Indeed. thinking news US states great terrible :O  Gasp! mean could certainly concoct scenario total number breakthrough transmissions greater unvaccinated transmissions, especially % population vaccinated increases. would still argument vaccination, still makes infections less likely less severe. Focusing breakthrough transmission bit misguided vaccines proven effective reducing transmission symptom severity. Since rate cases increased quickly, think might part (or most) reason hospitalizations are, now, peak. 

Of course, one could hope it’s vaccines available, hasn’t helped states battling record surges. data DNA based vaccines better adapted rapid viral mutations compared kinds?

“Well next town requiring them!”one parent said smugly. (We share bus company.)

Joke’s them. school board called state found it’s mandatory…and let bus company know.

Now next town masks buses, too. can’t help laugh badly backfired. dragon certain standards size scale money mountain disagree first rule learn MN always say like fair, even don't. Shit talking fair worse shit talking Twins, Vikings, Lutheranism time.  r/thatfunnyfeeling /Thread Considering ""unvaccinated"" transmission rates pretty much 100%, 20% rate good. (there Korean warship outbreak 320 sailors, 290+ positive - scary transmission rate among ""not positive"" doctors assuming contracted already recovered) Also, infected, outcome prospect FAR FAR better vaccinated unvaccinated.   get COVID symptoms within hour hours exposure? biologics like TNF-blockers treat autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis, considered ""severely immunocompromised"" CDC. 

The full list ""MEDICAL CONDITIONS TREATMENTS ASSOCIATED SEVERE IMMUNE COMPROMISE"" really don’t think it’s playing direness. 

I mean doesn’t make way sense show date case // death actually happened rather date actually uploaded system? 

I mean reported made situation look even worse meant would see massive number death es cases one day several days data rolled one. 

I’m sorry don’t think thought comment properly. Frump didn’t wait already severely ill get best treatment available time.  people vaccinated, cases deaths vaccinated. That’s vaccine doesn’t work, it’s basic statistics. one knows yet, unfortunately. I'd discuss detail medical doctor hopefully may information do.

Stay safe, I'm glad able get booster. 1918's medicine technology we'd 1918's life expectancy well. nearly many people hitting 80, ones would relatively good health (no diabetes, etc).

We'd also 1918 birth rates due poor contraceptive technology, would shift average age population downwards.

In words, general population would less vulnerable covid.

There would probably still higher mortality, much expect. choice made.

Right allowing people freedom get vaccinated *and* fundamentally altering behave allow possible, making sure get least mediocre medical care.

We either mandate vaccine ration care willfully unvaccinated. crazy unsustainable.  archdioceses realize donor base old people dry COVID gets them. old Catholic parents donate ton money church pushing vaccines heavily. got shots first opportunity. don’t understand risks COVID importance precautions, little authoritarian brains programmed follow church’s commands. first time life I’m thankful parents militant Catholics lol risk virus, I’m young? say benefits outweigh risks? benefits still spread it? got shot understanding wouldn’t spread family members, want return it. Anyone excited boosters?  really helpful therapist works modality. CBT asks ""how thought irrational?"", IFS asks ""what part need?"" among things. find far helpful.

I would also suggest take look Gendlin Focusing, complements IFS practice well. LMAO stick 1:1 ratio indica/cbd,

This do. Always mix bit CBD, although prefer sativa. Also never aim get completely blasted like younger days. enough take edge relax. people well good insurance, $1,300 pocket. Poor people shitty health insurance, $7,000+. Seems like fair plan. Almost none suggest requires work action businesses, corporations, government institutions, US always going constantly fall behind containing COVID. Treating COVID COVID vaccines ""personal responsibility"" issue we're situation we're right now. Luckily, many corporations actually taking responsible measures without prodding government, still enough.

I also find personally irritating article can't seem separate idea COVID surge COVID itself. What's going US COVID, failure public health institutions long-term goals policies. likely stems thinking COVID going disappear (""The pandemic over!"") policy can't effect COVID outcomes, far true. also odd there's also mention boosters extra immunity might provide vaccinated. vaccinated people still wearing masks public places least going pitch fit someone asks wear mask.

Not experience. Stores mask requirements deal kinds offended people saying ""but I'm vaccinated!"" wrong. press conference yesterday towards end open questions someone specifically asks that. pretty interesting. take pointed question. answering it. City stats show differences based ethnicity anything I'm going downvote you, strongly, strongly disagree.

The people saying realize narrow window pregnancy really is, realize badly many people want give birth children.

It ideal time, many people (due age), best opportunity going get. least baby protection well, since knows get approved vaccines. sort fee attached covid medical care voluntary unvaccinated. Haha okay okay. pro-vaccine anti-vaccine mandate. different young women? Everyone know 35 acting like doesn’t exist Philly. 

Maybe it’s I’m nurse work 90% women that’s know, everyone work vacationing going like it’s 2019 summer brought back mandate Washington. starts Monday. Yes, better opening prematurely (before herd immunity) ending massive surge like US now.

China performing top economic side precisely need lock massive numbers people every time ICUs full like here.

The cost testing containment clearly less cost shut economy. glad taking hardline approach since means continue deliver reasonable level goods supplies rest world.

Tourism additionally heavily impacted _because_ containment. domestic tourists replaced international tourism could travel freely inside country year. lost young nephew Covid. still family members say vaccine stupid, needed, dangerous. That's secret. I'm always anxious. till mid-September. supposed 8+ months dose 2. county health official said Pfizer track submit EUA end September. Turn around 4-6 weeks (maybe quicker) approval roll October (fingers crossed) cost effective (vaccine) safe treatment exists terrible disease, instead getting it, tens thousands people “choosing” get sick, putting tremendous strain (and risk) healthcare workers, shifting cost poor decisions onto others. Personal Responsibility (which keep hearing anti vax crowd) also mean financial responsibility. can't. idea go letting bodies pile up.

Push vaccinated people lawfully receive priority care facilities full. Encourage exclusion anti-vaxxers private spaces (including employment). long-term solutions guess need normalize treating like shit given responsible prolonging causing unnecessary suffering death. Yes cause dig even going anyway, might well try make marginal improvements. anybody know issues getting booster less eight months full dose first round? mother received booster it’s 5 months. said person giving shot reviewed card said issue. plan getting booster going eight month idea.

Election next year didn’t argue anyone. haven’t commented anything Twitter, asking question here.  gender, sex, abortion, climate change environment general, genetics, mental health/neurology, nature &amp; nurture, etc.

As bio grad confuse long, mixed list issues science “science”? exactly science say sexual morality abortion? wish nation could see community health issue work together overcome, something fight political overtones. useless. He's active hindrance. can't wait get state. 3 times India reporting 1.4 billion people. Looks legit think that's state Indiana  central Illinois, county south us 36% vaccinated, they'll coming covid treatment.  Lots reasons.

If they're starting Kindergarten, they're already year sub-par learning. Seems like let parent opt back virtual learning they'll need homeschool period time. parents capable variety reasons.

Financial concerns may make big ask poster keep kid home next 2+ months.

Kid's getting sick COVID good thing, cut dry thing school mask mandate idi0t pulling out. Like Eggnog? partners father admitted ICU area severe pneumonia 3 weeks ago finally discharged today. covid, fully vaccinated, lot struggles lung biopsy weeks really high oxygen hes finally tentatively diagnosed aut-immune issue.

I worry getting covid constantly he's released grateful got sick weeks ago today. went ER today might died getting help (his O2 78% admitted, cutting little close) due hugebsurge unvaccinated covid patient neighboring counties. reference cou ty 80% vaccinated neighbors fall 20-35% range.... Oh, sure. zilch anxiety though.  almost support parents situation right unless one parent stay home child day. Remote learning options axed across country offices demanding people come back. We'd also 1918's attitude towards disease death. People routinely died diseases prevent vaccines fancy technology, fairly minor injuries became infected due lack antibiotics.

Although rate we've driving antibiotic resistance (through overuse), days may returning within next decades.... data natural immunity rock solid, know re-infection occur, possible sky high infection rates early 2020 NYC enough folks walking around enough antibodies keep things getting control.  Florida always fucked data. trust anything report point. apparently that's stomping someone's rights whatever, tell someone take action keeps others going vents Saying vaccine yes monoclonal antibodies? understand either.  might everyone (for various reasons), add ""Talk friends family getting vaccinated.""  lot people at-home tests too, get reported time. headed place unvaccinated uninsurable.

There way health insurance company going risk multi day ICU ER trip high chance occurring unvaccinated people.

I suspect point people finally capitulate.  suspect police force Tucson would improve anti-vaxxers quit protest. There's also verses say test God, along lines.   I'm sure hypothesis trying prove disprove.

While data almost always preferable less data, quality equal, mathematics probability statistics give us confidence intervals (and credible intervals) reflect size sample well-understood. quarantine period vaccinated symptoms, still testing positive, safe engage in….intimacy someone else vaccinated? ""COVID never end"" ""the pandemic never end.""

People talking pandemic end, elimination eradication COVID. Might worth looking high CBD/low-THC strains. past I've used 1:1 ratio THC/CBD worked really well me. found tinctures edibles worked better cause anxiety paranoia inhalation might since comes slowly.

There's strain called Cherry CBD 2:1(ish) CBD THC. experience strains higher CBD help combat anxiety/paranoia pure THC strains would cause.

This assuming legal rec/med state pick get course. heads - them. old S7, newer A41. worth checking model.  crazy one. Good luck! every hospital... ship ain't pulling port. going rough chop harbor slowing it.

What happening southern states right speeding way situation longer worry hospital capacity.

Obviously rough way get vaccines could avoided that, hope see follow-up NE/MW fall surge (when weather gets crappy everyone heads indoors) like last year vaccinated better.

Maybe I'm omptimist, get kids vaccianted holidays, would gold.   company turned virtual offices (globally) course weekend early last year, 2020 profitable year ever. 2021 track even better. Employees encouraged decide works best -- office, home, hybrid -- management best accommodate decisions. I'm looking forward hiring best candidates leave companies lack WFH flexibility. I'm right you. point flat associate anyone believes ""Trump reinstated"" ""vaccines cause \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" anti-reality thinking. enough going daily life can't waste energy willfully stupid. Bupropion good lethargy depression. That’s frustrating :/ ""it go away April"" already though. transplant list smoking continue smoke get bumped list. Covid different. triage unfortunately necessary part medicine finite resources.  depends. helpful young people person more, mentorship network building. get older earn stars, necessary flexible due family obligations. .... forever WFH ? well thank god worry Lamda! *sweats nervously* right. thanks pointing out. realize vaccine.

that supports point even better, vaccines plus xx% people getting covid knock covid back stone age pretty quick Illinois State Fair supposed require masks indoor locations fair. enforced, means hardly anyone wearing masks indoors. county started recording 100+ cases covid daily week fair, so...

Happy see article mentions districts already taken step well. district small unlikely take step unless mandated state level districts around us vax mandate. Still, progress right direction. top others said, lot local health departments taken upon keep track vaccinations. County Health Department live (Southwest Missouri) started tracking daily cases breaking vaccination status. We're tail end summer peak (hopefully), we're seeing 85-95% daily basis still unvaccinated.

Now vaccination rate county poor (25% fully vaccinated. City live (Joplin) health department around 49% fully vaccinated 57% started first dose), vaccines ineffective, expect see something like 25% cases vaccinated, don't. probably half that. Reinfections, reinfections assume genetic sequencing simply asking ""Did covid before?"", account even less around here.

Now, vaccinated breakthroughs go places lot vaccination? course, still see matter overall cases trending down. becomes something Simpson's Francisco appears hit peak trending downward again, spike really extended.

This really simple data CDC collecting, good answer short getting people back offices school work track breakthrough hospitalizations death. That’s saying medical staff exhausted. Yeah, already applied way much logic response. I've made mistake pointint things like shout equally ridiculous nonsense.

This result misinformation disinformation, total inability gauge accuracy information, culture promotes toxic individualism, years growing (and occasionally justified) distrust institutions, media landscape thrives polarization. There's much unpack even know begin. I’m curious know 3rd shots also lead increase myocarditis cases. Israel first detect younger men 2nd shot. Hang there, it'll get better. 

At least that's keep trying tell push through. reality, knows. Eh, never thought COVID going disappear meaningful fashion *unless* majority people vaccinated. remember thinking lucky original strains COVID spread easily many Americans care vaccines; cases started decline small amount people getting immunity, great! 

But fact vaccines preventive tools cures. Given COVID disease comes goes waves, would make sense try urgently get many people vaccinated possible next wave comes. Herd immunity group effort individual task, frustrating see CDC constantly forgetting assert want herd immunity normalcy, means almost every adult needs vaccinated. that's message put wasted several months fighting masking instead focusing reaching herd immunity.

They keep saying herd immunity possible Delta, know. me, sounds like copout really overall plan deal Delta. Maybe instead publishing pithy articles, certain organizations actually need come together actually make long-term goals. state state qr codes vaccinated individuals would like booster specific variants.  evidence avoidable. We've seen countries high vax rates go this.
