Meh, depends whether class cages far are, etc.. can't make exact constellation article tho  going soft unvaccinated.   Vaccinated, care.  know exactly. trials run 6-8 months, know comparison intervals is. Worst case would probably getting another dose next year, worst case end positive test right supposed travel.

.5/1.25ths  American way think it. countries found level per capita death acceptable? Brazil? India?

We twisted society. theory countries countries don’t want effective keep Tedros in. see photo like article fair cannot imagine kids close enough said photos it... can't tell sure 11/21 6 months since second dose. However theres plenty doses available area. make difference get days earlier? Around 90% population needs immunity reach herd immunity Delta, even then, it’s going bumpy ride naive pockets population get hit virus &amp; spread it. 

I think coming waves likely become regional, move endemic stage.

The reason it’s impossible predict because, well, it’s really hard predict people. many get vaxxed? Wear masks? Avoid holiday travel? many sick taking precautions done it? Ready throw long overdue wedding? birthday party?

That said, still ton factors affect spread vary greatly location location:
- population density / urban crowding
- climate
- public health infrastructure 
- poverty 
- immunity status individuals
- health population / comorbidites
- age population
- behavior people
- sex population
- genetics
- restrictions &amp; policies I.e. mask mandates, strictly followed 
- timing vaccines initial exposure (assuming immunity wains)

The list could go on. would love could wrap bow make accurate predictions, time time proven incapable modeling virus. It’s incredibly complex easy get wrong.

*In Germany

It's actual source someone linked Reddit ask search again.  Look Portugal’s per capita deaths compared low vax rate country like Romania Bulgaria. Massively different delta wave. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore China basically eliminated Covid deaths.

These countries extremely high rates vaccinations elderly populations.

In Europe, really deaths issue, cases hospitalizations. lot unvaccinated adult Europeans, means plenty people left hospitalized. .... yes. I’m happy took J&amp;J April. protected got Moderna booster weeks ago. Hindsight always 20/20 see J&amp;J two shots start. Portugal, unvaccinated people seniors ones filled hospitals... least died enjoying freedom wearing masks. /s understand refuse to. know answer, friend.   busy election Covid19 even topic. Merkel last couple weeks head government, really anything anymore. need negative test travel, right? There's change positive test results rate day 7, continues improve day 14-16. Go [figure 2 Protection infection would come several days sooner, need negative test avoid inconvenience I'd try get booster sooner.  think put murder cats around children? unvaccinated people die usually. survive ones get dangerously ill hospital, taking space could gone non-COVID patient, they'll die. Many denominations lot 'free' type stuff make public announcements everything. Plus there's also huge swaths non-denominational christians.

Regardless, religious exemptions usually based around personal beliefs hard declare 'no religious beliefs prohibit vaccine'. got unvaccinated people thank vaccinated people infected since allow mutations grow jeopardize even vaccinated safety  Right, wondered pp include group. explanation makes sense.  80 90 % relaxed bomb exploding here.    first wave close 2,000 patients Dutch IC’s - beds clearly there. Problem first wave created much backlog elective surgery plenty patients really can’t wait anymore surgery. 

In end three options:

-Let’s increase IC capacity Covid patients, let people waiting surgery die

-Let’s get rid surgery backlog, let Covid patients waiting IC bed die

-Mandate restrictions lower Covid IC admissions

I think countries, including NL, going hybrid three mentioned options, it’s quite clear easy fix.    immunity fades months reliable. That’s true. It’s like 4 5.

At least that’s read *The Journal Lowest Common Denominator.*  eased pretty much them. Maybe possible achieve herd immunity via vaccination, vaccines designed Delta variant, there's many breakthrough infections viral numbers high unvaccinated (thought infection might last long) .

However, +90% people Delhi antibodies Delta variant seem reached herd immunity. Look graph know that's dangerous thing say, said new waves happened. 

What seems caused new waves, herd immunity possibly achieved, emergence new contagious variants, higher herd immunity thresholds, ability reinfect people. 

27% people Delhi reinfected Delta variant outbreak (40-60% antibodies, mostly Alpha variant Wuhan). new contagious variant circumvents immunity, reinfect people, might last. 

As countries, wonder might able reach herd immunity large percentage populations develope immunity Delta variant, via breakthrough infections via boosters, scientists think confer increased immunity variants, including Delta.

We need get people vaccinated get boosters out, need remain careful even vaccination. Eh Im worse that. recently got blocked HS friend making fun aunt. didnt get vaccinated dead now. laughed care makes asshole Im fucks give flawed mindset common due poorly-socialized people getting morals movies. instance, protagonist painted good guy gave choice bad guy beating blasting him.

It undeniably morally bankrupt analyze it.  Europe returning dark days complex that. best get, new variants greater infection rates resistance vaccines start popping up. We've socialized think opposite even though morally know right. 🤷🏾‍♀️ *shrugs*    can't speak countries exactly true Singapore (am living here). 

We still seeing 10-20 deaths per day population 5.6M, mostly unvaccinated and/or seniors. taken herculean carrot stick approach get elderly (specially 70+) vaccinated here. causes vaccine hesitancy varied - seen anyone know suffer Covid low community cases mid-2021, fear side effects exacerbating existing conditions, skepticism Western medicine, etc. Even now, think 90% mark fully vaccinated among elderly enough at-risk population. Oh, agree comment came racist tone. mean underlying assertion inaccurate based county data.

I hope sending mobile vaccination units.

And incidence getting, transmitting, especially dying COVID massively massively reduced among vaccinated. 

You’re law enforcement happy spread disease safe free FDA approved non trial vaccine makes uncomfortable. 

I know everyone good guy story you’re deluding case sorry man. 

You’re supposed helping protecting people you’re hurting instead. sooner leave without pay sooner world better place There's ""loopholes like depression"" ""maybe even ask"" that's good messaging. going get people going get boosters, versus saying get one reason.  Oh definitely! grew South-Eastern part LA county lived HB 6 years. I’d say even HB even red shift since left 5 years ago, it’s always bit conservative side - compare Irvine definitely left leaning. depends get completely different sides coin, I’ve definitely taken account deciding shop pandemic. states this. There's obviously surge coming.  Watch next one target skinny people work strongly suspect Brazil one highest Covid fatality rates per capita still underreported number deaths. think people Brazil know someone died hospitalized virus. Probably key factor everyone getting vaccinated. Care share violates 4th? precedent controversial much till last little bit (since ~March 2020) going need saying ignore 4th requiring vaccination. Especially given pro vaccination it’s forerunners LOT historical backing Sad. zoos I've visited extra space walkway cat exhibits required masks worn times.

If cop willing get vaccine protect community can’t intelligence empathy needed permission use lethal force citizens. 

Some bad cops may get sneak cops refuse (for non medical reasons) bad apples. Less 100 people age 12 died Covid US.  Even Flanders sees surge. 92% vaccinated among +12 years old.

The virus contagious vaccines effective enough infections.

Politicians want take unpopular opinions. little bit, yes.  Definitely makes appreciate girlfriend! Ooof. r/confidentlyincorrect Canada Covid made realise deal weight. BMI went 27 22.

My wife also lost 20kg since corona.  going furious find public schools US military.  nature Delta. places socially responsible, masked up, got jabs etc seeing surge cases.

Just look Singapore’s stats, I’m from. Mandatory masking indoors outdoors 1.5 years counting. even groups 2 limitations now. Delta replicates fast body even vaccinated people get symptoms (mild), vaccinated 4+ months ago barely puts dent transmission. Sep, local stats showed 40% vaccine effectiveness vs infection, it’s bound even lower except got booster. 

The better initial response was, fewer people naturally acquired immunity now. testing reporting better (higher percentage mild cases reported). ultimately it’s much worry hospitalisations deaths still low; it’s mostly mild vaccine breakthrough cases.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I’ve exposed covid 3 times since receiving booster never tested positive. kid covid coughed directly face, didn’t catch it. point I’m afraid anymore. Clearly vaccines amazing work. I’ll keep getting boosters advised, don’t care anymore kind shit anymore.    I'd argue none us really understand math, we're better abstract manipulations. can't subitize past small number objects  sure seen Astounding even got point  want live forever world distancing, masking, hugs, handshakes, avoiding movie theaters, concerts, bars social gatherings it. 

There’s difference living merely alive. numbers absolutely useless without local vaccination rates number hospitalizations. fully vaccinated community single breakthrough infection resulting hospitalization, 100% hospitalizations vaccinated patients, even though would incredibly infective vaccine. aren’t going cite enough data draw meaningful conclusions, please don’t cite it; statistics presented vacuum add confusion antivaxxers thrive. people disease prevention policy Spanish flu. U can't reason them. find amazing Brazil president openly vaccination attempted several times sabotage it, higher level vaccination whole europe (or germany matter) 100% right. Every bit helps, right tools toolbox use.

That plan get positive test. virus joke, want risk long term organ damage. Plus, want spread virus others. get pay care inflicted on?  fat lady sings. Also never said cure that's amazing gods told first. said well spread it. said oh well catch bad..lmao.. literally knew said elementary school natural immunity got sick alot. curious. can't figure literally could give 1000 doctors actually work icu covid.. One thing realize vaccine wears way faster vaccine. already get booster shot even year? I'm trying actually help people giving medicines actually help you. strong immune system key. die covid die inflammation causes. there's ways treat that. special doctors treat lungs heart.. name call someone ignorant literally attacks first. say take vaccine I? speak truth get upset. know covid attacks immune system? problem listen many doctors communicate people like listen mainstream bs. covid started doctors actually would communicate reason someone finds ways treat covid get banned shammed mainstream wants hear. everything say backed evidence data. actually want learn something let know. show data see information good. Also places really high vaccination rates really high cases. make sense? One thing kinda right vaccine helps immune system problem take might keep taking vaccine times year weak immune system. That's debate can't claim know that. Kids get vaccine sure chances getting side effects vaccine get side effects covid.  wanna play soldier fun gear like infrared goggles, tanks, body armor, AR-15s, etc. Right part follow orders. 

Well guess what? Good soldiers follow orders. Get fucking shots.   PTSD condition impacts bodymind holistically. many post-viral syndromes.

But person quoted article (if that’s faithful quote) person responding pushing (false) biomedical model attributes undiagnosable symptoms linked signs test abnormalities residual category ‘mental problems’, biomedicine uses disqualify people (disproportionately women) knowers bodies health. It’s power move, it’s infuriating.

Once you’ve experienced this, witnessed happen time dozens (female) friends acquaintances, see is. quite. biological differences could account this. example: studies indicated children less ACE2 expression cells, making virus less opportunity infect cells.

The innate immune system *school age (5-11)* child generally agile responding new viral threats create immune memory faster. immune system becomes less agile age, like adults become achy slow get older.

So children get COVID transmit virus, theory spread much young children 18+. 

This say almost entirely unvaccinated population schools vector transmission otherwise fully vaccinated households. Kids get COVID, get sick transmit others. mere cold children potential long term effects infection beginning understand. one cares anymore Yeah. I'm going going early grave virus. mean dig grave. I'm not. actually care health. also care staying alive.

Truer words never painted. Yes, respectively. overwhelming majority hospitalizations remain among unvaccinated -- along order 90% thereabouts people get breakthrough cases tend get sick. It’s law enforcement, course spotlight them. always be. Somebody watching watchmen, yes? Oh fuck, stop metric shit. nothing metric vs imperial.  paper illustrate plain truth, COVID US, unnoticed point.

Why must China labeled origin then? China noticed virus? fired long time ago.

from cannon. volcano. No, them. get vaccines preventable life threatening diseases. Children need attend schools. Employees need go work. vaccine help prevent virus killed 700k people country 2 millions around world. mandate sensible save lives. police work public, put everyone around risk getting vaccine. them. So, wait long figure out? 10? 20 years live normal ^might^ “long term complications”?

Nah. I’m good.

If 2 years, 2 shots booster vaccine isn’t enough let chips fall may.  feeling trust me. seems masking, quarantines restrictions endless. don’t like this, it’s pathetic become.  one could afford international flight nowadays, hell yes definitely afford quarantine.

China simply observe countries practicing ""good"" science perform make decision later. need drop quarantine hastely. People nothing post don’t come post unless it’s subject interests them. typically positive tend post report skews feel. mean vaccines effective? people testing positive getting sick? need data really. (BC) 50% people dying fully vaccinated. downfall combination elderly, comorbidity, five months since second vaccination. Boosters happening slowly, also know everyone's body works well develop antibodies way.  


I feel sad Covid deaths, particularly empathetic fully vaccinated.  waiting kill sick people justify afraid lives. Cool. Still it. want perpetual rolling lockdowns 5 years. would rather prepare now.

Why - I'm genuinely asking - people keep using argument? people long-term oriented? start ever start? Nobody forcing you. jailed killed get it. find new job (if area falls mandate.

It's 100% effective. vaccine is. REDUCES spread REDUCES severity disease. first one need get it. need police want able call without undue risk, able to. 

I'm sure seen many, many car accidents. seen outcomes people wore seat belts outcomes didn't. I'm guessing seat belts save everyone. Maybe rare cases even made things worse, like making burning submerged car harder escape. So, still recommend seat belts? Boost! like new scary injection that... Changes... DNA!

This fake science really thin vocabulary. taking vaccine, whatever reason, makes someone anti vaxxer? Hah, simple world we're living days.         Sorry, can't compare all. 

He **more** vaccinations lockdowns **vaccinated**, literally says video.

You one stirring things lies. Remember [this you:

PokeCaldy party planing legislation forbid closing schools **any social distancing measures** even regional governments.

The therefore longer new lockdown school closings. Instead, **possible introduce distance requirements public spaces, wearing masks 3G companies events**. Corona rapid tests free again. regulations initially apply March 19, issue correction? Sad Definitely getting Monday then. I'm wasting weekend that. don’t want shot, leave police force die alone trailer. one fucking cares. daily, regular testing per week. Oh going goner sooner. Boosters speed process. /s Lots school systems probably requiring starting next school year. It’s tricky 5-12 group already session. 

I know school operating assumption starting next year vaccine requirement students, like us adults  official vaccination requirement would provided AFD another 2% 5% voters. Pretty easy see it.   5000 people died since 1st September, already. Thanks anti-vaxxers. zero-CoVID strategy impossible. working 18 months China.

There zero local transmission vast majority country time, almost public venues (like restaurants bars) open. There's normality West, virtually infection death. massive success?

The main people sacrifice policy people want travel abroad overseas Chinese people want visit China, policy massively benefits 1.4 billion people inside China. impression popular China, level Corona weariness, people trust measures actually work. US Europe, constant slog virus never goes away, easier lose patience epidemic control measures.

The US currently 1000 deaths day. Scale China's population, get China's entire death toll since beginning pandemic single day. People US become numb numbers, they're acceptable China. many downvotes?  still option test daily unvaccinated? Lol  Good. GTFO. LAPD basically behave like criminal gangs. cliques subgroups names (so they’re gangs) bend points stars celebrate killings. Get worst worst there.  sheer amount hypocrisy unions unbelievable. gotta stop letting idiots gain exuberant amount power police somehow hold, makes sense becomes cycle incompetence. Rotten top bottom   I'm shocked nobody gets obvious sarcasm. getting vaccine feels like getting vaccine. see problem all. downvoted? obviously sarcasm.   cops required mandated vaccinations entering training condition employment? Nurses sure do. guys acting like whiny babies this? Fucking man up, jesus. union act like momma embarrassing. searched studies r/covid19 many many studies  1st wave IC beds IC personal, right we're close 2000 closer 1000. can't even used cause enough IC nurses. popped feed guess didn’t assume sub people hate people aren’t vaccinated lol. 

And jokes us. currently one “get f**ked” lololololol Yes, agree. clarification: j&amp;j age groups And? I'm vaccinated, hope enjoyed rant seems actually like gov mandates rather dislike Better die 3 years vaccine right Covid Idk, maybe barging coronavirus sub tell everyone vaccine obscure unfounded reasons smartest idea go lol. Also get fucked  Pick one

-Washing hands going bathroom

-No texting using computer driving

-Yearly fitness requirement tests

-No beating wife Lmao. Turning something else again. understand privilege thing. grew black best friend wasn’t one worry accused stealing something every time walked convenience store kids. was. exactly same. 26 years he’s still best friend still understand privilege okay. I’m sorry aspect life. it’s also fault. It’s shitty world live in. I’m gonna watch office go sleep. good one! Testing week fuck all.

Wearing mask merely protects others short period time.

A vaccine helps prevent mutations virus, also reduces transmission rate large amount.

""Oh doesn't, still infect others"" hear idiot without common sense cry.

But no, reduce transmission vaccinated. first, going suffer effects Covid less. means cough much less. Covid travel? water droplets expelled breath, projected much farther shout cough. reducing coughing reduce transmission lot.

In addition, beat infection much faster. therefore infectious much less time.

So getting vaccine provably better everyone.

""But safe, new!!!"" hear idiots scream.

But no, that's also bullshit. vaccine based stuff many years old. needed minor tweaks, exactly way flu jab based stuff previous research minor tweaks.

""But rushed out!!!"" No, wasn't, stop proving know nothing vaccines researched. vaccine requires funding, comes researching things usually lot delay getting funding people trial vaccine on. takes many years get funding tests. difference got funding basically overnight many businesses governments threw money multiple researchers find vaccine cure, test subjects lined help research. no, rushed, took amount time trial.

""What long term effects vaccine! know them!""

To extent true, first, still based previous work know long term effects. there's fact minor side effects we've heard far they're worth thinking about.

""Aha, dying Covid rare too!""

Yes, side effects vaccines rarer. What's more, ignore long term side effects Covid, always conveniently ignored ""Covid serious"" rhetoric.

And addition, side effects vaccines basically proven. someone gets blood clot vaccine, zero evidence vaccine caused it. much likely comes smoking, taking birth control, many things higher provable chance getting blood clot vaccination has. amount people suffering severe side effects (as in, headache sore arm, feeling nauseous) small actually likely something else causing vaccine.

Tl:dr - Get vaccine dumb pieces shit. don’t understand Tedros bunch kooky Europeans much sway US FDA CDC. That's assuming perfect vaccine breakthrough infections (the theoretical 1 - 1/R0 formula). problem vaccine efficacy vs infection like 40-70% depending long since second dose. Taking account, thought herd immunity vs Delta via vaccination. 

Everyone's going get it. Multiple times combination vaccination plus infection still give long-lasting immunity. Tedros wants vaccines 3rd world badly can’t hit Xi Jinping Sinovac? cry wealthy countries make MRNA vaccines giving 3rd doses; waning immunity withstanding. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Last lockdown lasted almost 4 months (home schooling two kids too) better long term...  study tell us use Hydroxychloroquine patient COVID? found 2 studies website cant find results even though listed completed. Nurse three years. ICU nurse another 2 yrs. Physician 6 year studying. Another five years specialization.  want power high That's point making. high vaccination rates, ventilation, high mask use **can** virtually eradicate Covid. Fatalism misplaced, we're getting done Europe US. Seems like really add /s, although think pretty obvious. graffiti need Again, that's privilege talking. good you? I'd rather defended first place thanks.  many, deal full ICUs regardless. many regions Germany we‘re already full, sending patients hospitals 500km away, even Italy. Surgeries postponed, patients need ICUs stuck normal hospital beds. Dark days? I'm sure, least Spain.
Clubs packed month now, mean packed, shoulder shoulder pre-covid capacity. last night counted 1 2 masks... vaccines something. I'd say ""long covid"" symptoms going norm many. populist move. truckloads exemptions (going outside psychological well-being, meeting family) one control it. pay health care paying healing?

Maybe US different, rest world government pays nearly health care cost. government taxes.

But point is, really trust doctors enough take vaccin, trust save get sick. Otherwise trust, freedom, able dick.   higher US ever get to. That’s big achievement. Sustained weight loss hard. kids parents, grandparents teachers. disease vectors. Sat 13th 38000 cases.
Sat 6th 30500 cases.

Same increase seen Fri, Thurs, Wed.

The numbers published everyday, stop ignorant. Munich, even hire medicine/biology/chemistry students work labs ICUs: early signs system collapsing. you? lack information vaccine works 

For Vermont? Low death hospitalizations compared amount cases  Wtf talking about? swear ppl want live fear Same! Started pandemic BMI 46, 30 3 pounds 29. Conspiracy theorists make lots videos. What’s constructive alternative?  Covid dangerous. Even among 75+ risk death low. It’s Ebola. Romania definitely literacy rate 60%. around 99%. need make ""Letzte Kraftanstrengung"". 

I'm tired. waited long, nothing. knew since summer eventually happen nothing prevent that. 

And tyranny unvaccinated. fill hospitals eventually get restrictions again.

We need compulsory vaccinations eveyone, simple. end pandemic voluntarily vaccinations. need end somehow. 

I see us situations next year.  FDA actually. June said would require least 4-6 months follow data. either late July early August (can’t remember exactly) asked Pfizer Moderna double size trials. 

Neither makes sense safety standpoint. major adverse reactions seen within 2 months going 2000 kids 4000 kids still give large enough sample size see rare side effects (like myocarditis), you’d need tens-of-thousands that. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

as understand it, controlling everyone expand power, eventually pushing everything one world government. somewhat understand concerns surface level, whole thing unravels actually think it. 'why' that, would likely greed. think unlikely people want things, mean afterall billionaires insist making money? warlord's world insist warlords would benefit everyone around (and themselves) stopped brutality put effort developing city/country. 

It's greed. want never enough money/power/influence types people. feels least indirectly related misunderstanding statistics.

Not much statistics, straight critical thinking. Like, always point NSA could keep surveillance wraps couple years expanded patriot act. took 2-3 years hard evidence get leaked whole thing exposed, think something like VAERS get leaked exposed falsifying data, despite way accessibility people involved it. country far gave forced vaccination anyone.

Just restricted thing do. Many better Germany. I'd add Uruguay there. Argentina lot problems start Sputnik shots, specially 2nd doses high number high profile VIP vaccinations general poulation deaths same.time.  Oh really sad. state-led laws federal laws. Biden also issued mandate. hold court. unprecedented. Thankfully. unfortunately still large disparity supply vaccines rich poor countries Four characteristics God posited relation COVID: Intent teach, intent protect, intent punish, finally passive God chooses intervene.

In each, (perhaps clearly second) seems cause, thus deserves blame.

These four explanations leave fifth: consequences choices, consequences narrow choices generations follow. 

In fifth scenario, blame lies feet, His.

Edit: clarification parentheses Marburger Bund Doctors' Association worried rapid spread corona virus Germany. ""I never worried pandemic now,"" said chairwoman association, Susanne Johna, newspapers Funke media group. number corona patients intensive care units rise much coming weeks places supra-regional, perhaps even Germany-wide transfer necessary. politics ""a power vacuum old future government, federal state governments"", Johna complained. federal government zero history issue thing. Vaccine laws clearly left states hands. stand court. 

It's sad see Reddit decide use rational accurate thought to. understood law understand always states powers. Austria showing what's needed 🇦🇹 Americans fucking stupid.

I live third world country, desperate get vaccines, I'm supposed get 2nd dose week enough vaccines I'd wait. Cases rising. strict lockdown 6 months.

Almost Americans reported losing weakening faith response pandemic time. contrast, nearly one-third believers indicated coronavirus outbreak strengthened faith. theoretically develop empirically test three religious factors—theodicy, practices, tradition—to explain variation strengthening effect COVID-19 pandemic among believers. Results statistical models show two theodicic interpretations—believing God: using pandemic way tell humanity change; personally protect virus—significantly increased believers’ reports faith strengthening, controlling factors. also found Black Protestants likely report interpretations, turn strengthened faith response pandemic.

Basic literacy still needed fall vortex moronic bullshit days… could without reading facebook telegram? yeah, go ladder much necessary expand everything. seems like option right restrictions next 5-10 years boost health system, restrictions forever want proactive. thing is, average Brazilian well aware shit health system whatever takes stay away hospitals.  Totally worth current wave... Lockdown not, wave eventually stop. certainly detriment animal’s health catch COVID, wonder even possible stay closed long. Running zoo expensive. getting admission could mean money food medicine. Every waves, every countries, smart people thinking new ideas explain curve over.  No, shouldn’t surprise you. Many zoos vaccinating animals, especially felines, COVID. surprising. work privately owed company 100 employees started sending memo's vaccine requirements weekly testing last week. Cheddar made good video hand hygiene Desinfektion imo still important. big issue (and think point good video) much, much likley get covid aerosols surface.
Since covid business desinfect pencils surfaces follow policy aware right covid ffp mask / staying home sick / social distancing means way important.

By means keep desinfecting hands follow rules guidelines country. people freaking vaccine mandates? always them. George Washington mandated vaccines soldiers. Massachussetts mandated smallpox vaccine 1902 Supreme Court ruled legal mandate vaccines. Kid required get 10 different vaccines go school. Vaccine mandates nothing new. wrote smells dangerously metaphysics, knowledge body acceptable obtained scientific method applied form - evidence-based medicine.  ADULT*... PISA results say otherwise...

What low vaccination rate adults? actually visit zoo look photos? Perhaps Spain still nice weather. Northern Europe seems going belly up. ADULT*... PISA results say otherwise... publish vaccination status positive tests - number unvaccinated catching worry about. countries reporting information, though. can’t either. we’ve kinda pushed away them. grandma tested positive Covid got bad took hospital 7 days. made still recovering home. took monoclonal antibodies, oxygen low gave steroids 6L oxygen. also happened low sodium. idiots saying low sodium. still charge. fucking job finish 16 years disastrous nothingness   rather way die.

Deal consequences best possible. Thanks. Good know people government sensible Medical nursing schools don’t places. Expanding discussion long Covid, it’s happening, it’s fast. medical students graduating need residency placements available well and, guess what, there’s also shortage those. easy fix. didn’t. That’s concerning Well, people better others ways. observing people better ways bothersome you, going spend lot life bothered. condition may make vaccinating lethal, since lot research shown may give heart ailments young males. will, soon, still mandate getting vaccinated. booster shot already coming. live Netherlands. honest, 3G bad joke current situation literally says ""Weil diese Maßnahmen nach wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen keine Wirksamkeit haben und weil auch deutsche Gerichte solche Ausgangsbeschränkungen ja bereits verworfen haben"" means - since we're english subreddit distancing measures ""have scientifically proven without effect recalled courts"". first point simply false (and pull Ioannidis study argued times many) second point technically true since Saarland court found rules ""unclear"" lifted temporarily state government clarify (which took 4 days deemed legally correct put back place). 
After completely disbelieving Ingo Zamperoni asked hear again, added something studies vaccinated people - also summarily untrue since vaccination reduces transmission, near zero vaccinated people (see recent study [last month )

So either uninformed - using dogwhistle, something done past. (I think agree stupid understand things saying.)

Also, let's forget several specialist state legislation call claims ""legal necessity"" remove ability several measures false claim (with notable exception curfew rules).

Also even members party declaring legislation insufficient example secretary health Schleswig-Holstein arguing ""Ampel"" aka traffic light coalition (still forming, real government yet Germany) rescind previous statements keep laws exceptional pandemic situations place instead lifting end November.

Lastly, either need look complete definition social distancing measures (I recommend ) realize taking away almost effective measures except hardly controllable physical distancing public.

So yes - get correction follows since might formulated tiny bit broadly:

""his party planing legislation forbid closing schools social distancing measures except physical distancing public places even regional governments.""

The response pandemic national level promoting vaccines? actually know breakthroughs reinfectioms would thing since first vaccine rolled out. *All* literature discussed vaccine efficacy *before* clinical trials repeated over. fact common assumption might hit south 50% clinical effectiveness, perhaps protection infection. 6 months later protection infection dipped beneath 50% clinical efficacy remains 90%. 

So give little perspective: 85% “breakthroughs” end hospital 65 80% 75. you’re 65 vaccinated actually pandemic you. you’re 65 got booster, you’re also good go. 

If still gets might flu. kid, provide vaccination proof enter elementary school, middle school, high school, college, team sports.

This nothing new. remember something minks vaccine debate/wars I'm sure sides debate think side.  leopards come close enough humans get infected? Meanwhile: Romania highest School-Dropping rates highest iiteracy rates eu 30% vaccination rate....coincidence? reason surges falls way actually due herd immunity. finds vulnerable population, burns it, crashes runs hosts pool susceptible people surrounded immune herd. 

In US example, population heterogeneous behaviors immunity travel common virus lots opportunities find new susceptible pools.

So virus finds pool susceptible hosts surge pool. matter many people outside pool vaccinated it’s gotten in. ￼Herd immunity limits viruses ability travel get *some* herd immunity even first infection virus wide spread moved around lot herd immunity less effective. 

It’s possible eliminated spread little might find already passed thresholded needed herd immunity reliably protect us never even stopped spread first wave we’ll probably need much larger percentage become immune we’ll benefit much might otherwise herd immunity.

Family member mine died 2 weeks ago, vaccin. got sick told everyone take upon get better. 

He went quarantine, next day passed kitchen ambulance called.

Barely 40 hours later ICU, 20 days later decided pull plug, organs failing.

Imagine daughter take care dying...

I get point no.  That's phrase looking for, bad.  agree answer specific case, think reason bit nuanced.

I think there's two things going here:

* actual system units
* convention system units

I'm talking less actual system units conventions come along it, even though time folks mean system both.

I pointed weights measures, actually use fractions US. Eliminating fractions solves burger-confusion problem, precisely never see fractions grocery store point sale.

NIST Handbook 44 (2020) say Customer’s Indications. – Weight indications shall  shown  customer’s side computing scales used direct sales retail customers. Computing scales equipped operator’s side digital indications, net weight, unit price, total price, shall similarly equipped customer’s side. Unit price displays visible customer shall terms single whole units weight **not common decimal fractions unit**. Scales indicating metric units may indicate price per 100 g.

Any unit decimalized, done US needs unambiguous customer without requiring math (also see fuel pumps). got rid minor units standardized would decimalized, would nicely solve issue. I'd pretty happy used pounds gallons prefixes think unit conversion hard. 90% use voice assistants checking US customary unit conversions, kind absurd think it.

To point, smaller units ounces let represent weights without fractions, due way US customary system works (and burgers sold, specifically pound), sneaky fractions. 8oz burger (albeit delicious) 8/16 1/2 lbs burger, we're back original problem.

And let's honest, even use metric everywhere US, quarter-pound burger would likely still advertised time come inertia, confusion disappear anytime soon.

This long way say think metric system per-se solves problem, metric convention solves problem. adopted conventions US customary units (like already grocery store, filling car fuel example), also solves problem.  appreciate rational response here. Tenth Amendment argument somewhat makes sense. However, federal government whole slew enforced laws given Constitution. duplicate laws mirror state laws, existence shows precedent.

I think Childhood Immunization Initiative 70’s today also plays role federal program.

Biden attorneys certainly know seem convinced.

I appreciate trying go emotional response, too.  wrote last week start triage, unvaccinated told ""sorry"" left fend themselves. stand that. see ethical concerns that.  Unfortunately, higher vaccination brings deaths pandemic many people loose common sense getting jab. major failure media public education. failed deliver important message vaccinated people spread covid well.

Or perhaps without strict rules population unable use common sense general hard measures work. See Australia, South Korea much better shape right now. Germany pays populism ""freedom"" stupid.   lol yeah probably sound like much, feel like asking anything hypocritical. main issue asking eat dining halls take food back room since walk long way meals.  Choices consequences. Always have. Always will. think former. least hope so. way NHS could cope exponential rise cases currently experienced continent. experts UK knew that. shit things bad funding NHS staffing levels allow Covid spread way summer, option. think European countries done similar thing experiencing going get whole lot worse. Hopefully though, enough people get boosters limit hospitilisations / deaths. mention breakthrough infections less transmissible due lower viable viral load well contagious 3-6 days opposed 13-18 days unvaccinated. I’m pretty sure one exempt here. haven’t vaccinated haven’t recovered (currently testing still get in), can’t get in, like anywhere (anything except supermarkets basically, they’re planning changing too). Period. Austria's 7-day case rate approaching vertical line. Looking Germany facing medical system collapse still thing treating individuals island definition insanity.

Society relies basic standards function sanctions fall short.  Covid19/vaccination updated *the bare minimum* someone needs meet. walks like duck quacks like duck... kind precaution want take tho ""People hate unvaccinated people"" damn victim mentality strong guys, salute  People want act like obesity personal failure. way, don’t anything cultural drivers obesity, like exploitation, wage inequality, racism, proliferation sugar food supply, etc. take Humans (a social creature) force anti-social behavior, leading mental health crisis world wide?  play devil's advocate, Constitution pretty clear 10th Amendment powers explicitly given Federal Government left states people. think necessarily clear cut. Biden using OSHA government contractors means straight mandate. *has* ruled states power mandate public health remedies, certain federal government can. think Biden advised pretty smart constitutional lawyers we'll see. Oh no! tarnish sterling reputation LAPD?!?!  Denmark done? Additionally Alexander said similar vaccination rates UK vaccinated elderly fewer young people. So, burden hospitals higher here. UK still around 5% better VR, lot. Complicated ethics. I’m individual liberty stops others endangered actions. fight pandemic everyone want? hand sure agree mandatory vaccination. vaxxed don’t think forced. UK ahead curve, source wave arriving continent. Airborne Ebola? wait Faux News Amuricans spin yet another thing politicize ignore. seriously little hope left America. can't imagine virus deadly enough Amuricans wake up. yes, I'm woke! agree first paragraph im pro vaccine im sceptical mandates. Several things critically omitted like bringing vaccine people economicly weak neighborhoods foreign speaking ones. Spain etc wrote letters everyone, including making appointments etc. Pressure low aswell etc controlls 2G 3G couldve worked several months ago, 2g 3G vaccines would work slowly, seems way reducing contacts, therefore mandates questionable. complicated topic.   Lmao, ok bud whoooosh :) I'm saying brutal regime like China enforce stringent enough measures almost stop disease spreading, can't fathom anyone would take word it. ""No guys, Xi says good everything says true Covid gone!"" Also many mouths feed, can't imagine could anything drastic enough stop delta without mass starvation would basically halt many forms food production. believes vaccine kill everyone, she'd obviously want take chances Covid's &lt;1% mortality rate instead. going convince otherwise long genuinely believes conspiracy theories. Australia higher vaccination rate average western European country: police stop resisting?  see? seems useful (if all), outcomes fairly similar, believe right now. Yes. breakthrough cases. But, brrakthrough cases require far less hospitalizations unvaccinated cases. anyone get vaccinated get fucking vaccinated! healthcare systems dont get overwhelmed patients.   video, conclusions seem questionable.
The study Clinical studies indicated **patients severe COVID–19** exhibit delayed weak adaptive immune responses; however, mechanism SARS–CoV–2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, using vitro cell line, report SARS–CoV–2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, required effective V(D)J recombination adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, found spike protein localizes nucleus inhibits DNA damage repair impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 53BP1 recruitment damage site. 

So, rather people severe Covid, vaccines protect against, bashing mrna vaccines. jump conclusion seems disingenious. Furthermore seem problems study, link recommend reading comment starting TL;DR - findings questionable physiological relevance since use completely irrelevant cell line (kidney cells), rather using lymphocyte progenitors (immune cells actually engage VDJ recombination) airway cell lines.

Furthermore delete comments, usually red flag.

Oh yes, vaccines flights totally thing since decades enter certain countries.

However struggle vaccine mandates now. It’s proven vaccines aren’t effective limiting spread (they may limit window spread, that’s still researched). latest studies saw 30% reduction spread including non delta variants. 


I fully believe mandate makes sense enforced vaccine reduced spread significantly, don’t really understand point vaccinated individuals also spread it. know I’m sounding like anti vax guy (which hate). what’s point mandates? it’s prevent getting sick, isn’t individual choice?

Because above, all. Get shots, roll dice death putting mask someone (more likely not) selfish entire pandemic. focusing new Covid cases wrong. Look death rates. much lower places good vaccination rates. Covid stay see waves every winter least. got booster, need take precautions move life. shit ain't ending ever. huge difference living life avoiding eating communal space week two.

Why people always go extremes? 

Even mom triple vaxxed - daughter going feel infects her? mom asked relatively trivial thing - it? Yes be. fucking work unfortunately. probably turn full lockdown everyone, even vaccinated, weeks, I'd guess. 


The idiots charge proclaim pandemic ""won""/""over"" times multiple times. make sure people - idiots - take seriously. ""But stopping spread expensive now! Can't delay make cheaper?"" aren’t kids Australia kids anywhere else?

Kids Australia learn fight giant deadly spiders fend kangaroos  clinical trials start?

Ireland 90% adult population vaccinated still one highest rate infections Europe. think? much unvaxxed usually shout things need get back normal, they're ones keeping us so. know, Munich hiring students ICUs apparently something already happening. UK atm around 6 kids per week die COVID btw preexisting condition goal keep deaths relatively low overflow hospitals. 

Which possible number cases gets constrained limit. *is* already ""stopping spread"" - implies R0 &lt;= 1. Also less likely severe case, that's main goal right now, keep people get hospitalised crush medical system. implement ? people giving liberty safety security

Part living society giving bit liberty exchange safety security.  Almost never? Often enough .. imagine forced to, also people concerned comes health kids neglect own. Hypocrisy finest. Thats longer case Europe. Cases rising among vaccinated.

Why think France pushing booster shots unvaccinated worry about?  Downvote me, believe word medical experts' mouth regarding timelines holding ""justtttt little longer."" I'm sorry, no. We've two years. clear we're wearing masks indefinitely, I'm going lose anymore life traveling, going movies, restaurants, people. Fuck noise. mention nearly every diet diet product scam. crash diets end rebounds vast majority cases permanently injure body weight loss show it.

“Due pandemic, registered 50 percent decrease [in clients], initiative hope number customers rise again.”

So yes, free, 30 minutes sex.
They need new customers. That’s great people getting first doses. took son day one shot, parents getting boosters time.  clinical trials start? Also, choose country look covid incidence behaves unvaccinatrd vaccinated population. first shows exponential growth, later linear growth. Add together get exponential growth teh population whole. Example: Icus Austria basically almost entirely occupied unvaccinated. government talking infection insidence 390 going vaccinated crowd unvaccinated way 1000 rising exponentially. Ok, tells underlying healthcare issue it’s making situation worse. ever get rid virus it? E.g. herpes simplex something can't ever lose, AFAIK.  issue solely, United States, federal government enforce it. clearly policing powers state state health department. 

Army’s Schools go mandate away. Pushing burden onto employers seems bit overreach. employer mandate means respect employers right. I’d like see around world.

You either want functioning member society, want society die out. telling clear statistics infection numbers among vaccinated going vaccinated exponential growth. Sure vaccinated test less cause strain icus ... argument moot icus brink collapse triage started. Hope get well soon. congratulations/glad two vaccine doses. first line reminds cop complained wearing mask prevented breathing. symptoms listed led two distinct conditions: panic attacks, wuss.

I feel base thought comes wrong premise.

As society strive attain absolute freedom. Hell, one advocates people free mass murders, almost countries earth laws guns people agree it, stealing also something agree people free do, etc...

Point is, society constantly looking improve safety security place freedom, way around. Even look cars dangerous are, realize 99% accidents happen people broke law regulations place, remove freedoms drivers improves safety. 1%, governments constantly trying find solutions improve safety.

This seen sectors, aviation food healthcare. past present continue following trend future. 

Summing up, use excuses freedom that's wrong every level. admit instead want vaccine mandates personal reasons, ok admit that, also agree vaccine mandates (mainly believe vaccines way get us pandemic). despite point view, understand urgently need follow path get pandemic, even start wrong one, eventually turn right direction. unvaccinated lockdown, can't go brothel get vaccinated. Misleading headline Requiring work school would much simpler. also can't go stores except food necessary items. one generally hopefully goes conversation, went comment good faith. reasons comment valid. think qualified health professional document you, exempt vaccine mandate (but necessarily exempt lockdown unvaccinated next 6 months; year two future, covid subsided further, exempt lockdowns well, even generally unvaccinated exempt). guess logic “if approved young children, guess it’s safe.” Germany old cooking recipes still use pound, metric pound (500g exactly). Simplifies lot things honestly. risk basicly mean low every going get. court recognizes government positive ethical responsibility protect Americans. Without that, point government.

Now, may camp government almost government ad you’re free believe that. However, government government trying function way intended. credible source claim driving vaccine resistance primarily communities communities color? figure same. Anyone unvaccinated street needs say walk safe. applaud attempt, doubt much Calm Putin Sounds like you’re conspiracy theorist 🤷 Huh?! original post San Joaquin Valley.

The recommended pediatric dosage 10mcg.

Using 1/3 adult ""purple cap"" vaccine would result 10mcg... That's ""correct dosage"" 5 - 12 age range. way could administered LESS 10mcg dilute properly because:

Purple Cap Yield = 6 doses
Orange Cap Yield = 10 Doses

All could avoided protocol followed. 

So, really comes diluted. Case rates among unvaccinated 4-5 times vaccinated: difference pronounced among school-aged kids, despite tested multiple times per week, decreased testing among vaccinated cannot explain disparity. Oof. generally read CNN. make lot mistakes like this. (Aside: partisan comment. CNN worse outlets part political spectrum.) Vietnam places ask see vaccine certificate need open either PC-COVID SSKTD apps show it.   think reduction hospitalizations deaths we’re aiming for. that’s flu-like levels, assume we’ll essentially back normal. spread never stop, it’s killing many people, virus become annoyance like flu common cold. don’t know I’m talking about, seems like endgame me- getting hospitalizations deaths keeping down. idea long that’s gonna take, imagine happen overwhelming majority people gained immunity either vaccines catching (the ones survive catching it, is).

""muh rights"" people could please turn around affronted choices. \*used\*  Also, corona patients intensive care average younger. means that, unlucky, take somewhat time die. increases load intensive care units.

As regions, many elderly even make ICU previous waves. many headlines comments focus raw case numbers themselves, context &amp; extrapolation; 2.5% hospitalization rate/case low (US, example, nearly 3 times higher). It’s severe outcomes matter, cases relevant project future figures

Yeah. ideally we'd know deaths/hospitalizations figures, cases already lag 1-2 weeks behind infections. try follow hospitalizations weeks, following deaths would mean we're looking snapshot pandemic much months ago.

The inability up-to-date metric hardest part pandemic planning. Even cases least week date. get constant yo-yo results (the 2-month cycle) overreact late changes prevalence. Well, already 50 different agencies issue driver's licenses, that’s fun. Asking one app rule would great, without nationalized healthcare, don’t see happening. It’s already mess trying keep track vaccines US. 

But again, I’d love national vaccine database would fully support it. I’m saying already tools right easily check vaccine status, even they’re imperfect. Russia sucks Sure thing! Tylenol hand too, case! think fair enjoy government saying ""you must else"".

Again, I'm anti vax. got mine soon able. Can't wait till 3 year old get really stop worrying Covid.

But end day government forcing vaccines people, even indirectly, rubs wrong way think that's fair.  view much view petulant toddler crossing arms saying: ""NO! can't make me!"" they're asked eat vegetables, take bath, basically anything that's good them. contrarianism sake contrary. admit that? definitely pretty logical argument Federal Government require anyone taking federal contracts. want vaccinated give federal contracts. know companies require vaccinations give cushy contracts. latch onto logical pondering emotional crap, get vaccinated. do, rescheduled appt next Sunday would convenient sick Monday, thanks!  spot-on. weeks ago, schools opening autumn, North-Rhine Westphalia also horrendous high incidence numbers among school children. However, vaccination rate higher there.

In Bavaria, horrendous high numbers, started South Bavaria near Inn river, border Czech Republic. seems spreading Lower Bavaria Munich, really bad - six million people live there, especially Munich strongly reliant public transport difficult protect aerosol transmission (at least theory, seen numbers one).


But case, weather getting colder, days shorter darker, people meeting much inside, might straw breaks camel's neck also West North-West. What's stop getting vax 5 times like sex? got first dose Moderna back January.  never went back second dose scared seeing many people feeling ill getting it.  get vaccine again, go second dose Moderna, first dose Moderna, one shot Johnson&amp;Johnson? dumb side?

You [76% 2-dose vaccination better lot places, nowhere near Mumbai's 87% seropositivity point Delta pandemic ended there. far know giving third doses nobody fully vaccinated Delta - 11% population would currently eligible, number going rocket next months.

The problem cases [are currently 42% week. 5-day serial interval that's R(t)~1.28. really slow rate fine, 42% weekly growth sustainable long. means today's hospitalizations, they're 3 weeks ago average, already pace increase nearly 3-fold infections already happened. R(t)~1.28 implies final attack rate remaining susceptible. 

How many susceptible still idea. highest could would around 40% (everyone unvaccinated decent portion 2-dose vaccinated), would imply 70,000 total hospitalizations 8,000 deaths unmitigated wave. could easily third that, case flatting curve bit really need do.

Europe's obsession either full lockdown full opening pretty weird. also quite strange mask law (right?) that's enough mitigate Delta. Ironically one least united western countries think of. anti-vax people people fear discrimination. want cake eat too. fighting vax efforts, believing misinformation, trying stroll pub. australia one ""doctor"" prosecuted giving dispensation vax. also governments higher level security sites. online business fence around get notified someone breaches it. government also knows someone able breach sites full time staff monitoring sites I'm sure even understand dubious reasoning getting flu shot. COVID refusal reasons really apply vaccine use decades. still caring feel it? changing minds? No. mandates actually huge success? Yes. 

That said. US always said federal vaccine passport, is.  cant wait see Joe Rogan confuses Austria Australia next podcast. working well Canada. sign using site used book vaccines, save image co taining vaccine info phone print out. also wallet sized ones print  shows 25% percent fully vaccinated households contracted Covid-19 vs 38% unvaccinated. That’s grand gap media would believe.

Sure better? doubt. enough justify significant measures? don’t know. Sure, lots missed cases. would also tentatively agree vaccinated people test less unvaccinated (some data late spring showed opposite, doubt still holds).

But undercounting cases among unvaccinated factor 4 relative vaccinated seems like stretch me.

The difference even pronounced among people aged 12-17: There, unvaccinated 5 times likely infected. Add fact students tested 2 3 times week (at least one PCR, often two). lower amount undetected cases, yet gap larger among students. 56% people disapprove government. Exactly, impacts voting population point. Science seems partisan divider awhile; global warming biggest divider last decades.

""There epidemiological link locality Wuhan, including Wuhan Institute Virology (WIV) located south Yangtze subject considerable speculation. Although early cases direct epidemiological link market (World Health Organization, 2021), expected given high rates asymptomatic transmission undocumented secondary transmission events similarly observed early SARS-CoV cases Foshan (Xu et al., 2004).""

The authors blood donor* paper say otherwise either. US highly capable disease detection, moreso China, clearly highly susceptible population - would seen elsewhere first started somewhere else. also animal markets like China, makes chance crossover many many times lower.  Basically people hospitalized significant extent unvaccinated (whom shall restrict)

The thing *cannot* isolate group people virus. true also case unvaccinated people. want reduce spread, accept get infected huge numbers, many - arund 100,000 perhaps - die, health system collapses.

In terms R0, three options:

R0 1: case described above. utterly unacceptable.


R0 &lt; 1: would need sustain measures lower incidence numbers. Many deaths well collapse health system prevented. relaxed enough people vaccinated - personally believe get without vaccine mandates

R0 = 1.0: would mean enough measures cases raise further. requires much higher level control previous alternative. also means deal high case numbers *all time*. *harder* R &lt; 1 strategy, *and costly top that*. like Sisyphus rolling stone hill, carrying arms balancing head.

Our immune systems typically start drop antibody production eventually exposure pathogen. course retain immune memory low level antibodies, nothing like several months following vaccination infection. viral infections take weeks affect us, sufficient stop cause symptoms physiological harm. viruses take days infect us, memory cells may react quickly enough sterilizing, still help prevent severe illness reduce duration infection.

Excuse me, mean hipoo. pipe dream. China zero near-zero local cases ever since end first wave early 2020.

Lecturing China adopt disastrous CoVID policies US Europe followed silly. China likely continue current policy there's clear way open without suffering sorts large death tolls Europe US currently enduring.

That might mean widespread administration booster shots, wide availability effective drug treatments, lower numbers internationally. right now, basis reopening exist.   misinformation spreads many Americans awful Correct, caveat age 75+ - even fully vaccinated boosted, hospitalized Covid, risk death still high. subset makes almost entire population deaths huge portion vaccinated merely hospitalized. 

I think fact stressed nearly enough media says ""80% (name almost hospital) Covid ward unvaccinated. 20% left made 90 percent elderly. mean, 60's nearly there!

The fact almost anyone &lt;60 years old unlikely hospitalized vaccinated, perceived 4:1 ratio misleading... Stop resisting comply. Amirite? real world evidence suggest major contributor pandemic

I know anyone claiming cold-chain transmission major contributor pandemic. zero-CoVID environment, however, care route virus could re-enter country. Countries tens thousands new cases day care rare transmission routes. Countries zero local infections day point poor vaccines China come with

The vaccines use China similar efficacy AstraZeneca, somewhat better Johnson &amp; Johnson. fact, technically similar AZ J&amp;J shots (adenovirus vector vaccines). They're effective mRNA vaccines, still reduce hospitalization death 90%.

Vaccine quality issue. China abandon zero-CoVID policy, could experience sort large-scale outbreak Europe going right (despite relatively high vaccination rates, using mRNA vaccines). prospect viewed unacceptable China. Cases AZ started ramping July huge ramp August.

April May benefit much lower spread Delta huge number people recently vaccinated. that, Delta taken major strain US.

California saw thing happen, also many major cities brought back mask mandates. Bay Area saw Covid cases dropping immediately. 

Areas high vaccinations mask mandates aren’t seeing issues areas without mask mandates are. absolutely comes wearing mask, far contagious variant waning immunity (mixed people immunity all.) responsible however.

Alabama shows 15% total cases vaccinated individuals, rate vaccination rate 45% given one dose. Minnesota’s death rate 41% vaccinated individuals.

Lucky them, right? probably loved one suddenly needed hospital bed get one understaffed Covid burnout overwhelmed unvaccinated breakthrough infections. Pfizer opened another group kids testing last week, definitely still testing. son 4 trial. supposed unblinded January 2022 see actually received vaccine. Hope helps. Im saying increase number lymphocytes body produces fight infection. antibodies world aint shit except attaching virus marking it. virus still much thing marked. Denominations governing bodies could speak vaccine felt need to. None have. Isn’t unvaccinated going hospital? everyone overreacting. chose die, let  every possible intersection US police choose route worst option citizens country.

They necrotic purpose. Netherlands 82% fully vaccinated hospitals still getting overwhelmed. sure downvoted probably weight issue.

Its basic common sense though. organs dont grow size compensate body mass. larger standard weight organs stress compensate extra mass. youre overweight immune system going working exponentially harder larger get.  country like Germany barely scraping low end 70% fully vaccinated, know things dire. 

Then there’s Poland. needed shake heads facepalm harder days.  Oh no, it'll take 18 30 weeks train new vaccinated cops! Whatever do?! hard fill positions, mean 60k per year avg salary, pension plans, paid healthcare - one want work jobs! Especially actually perform sworn civic duty protect community getting life saving shot arm!!! mink farmers think vaccinated animals read govt shuts down. gah. everything awful. vaccine gives resources. literally helps produce needed antibodies case ever get virus. Reduce fractions. Germany summer prepare foreseeable wave. 

Macron announced restrictions unvaccinated July notoriously anti-vaxx population already stopped getting vaccinated mid 50s %. Germany ahead time 60%.

Merkel back clearly said want follow French way try different things like motivation. 

France 88% adult population vaccinated, Germany 77%. booster shortage. Go fucking get throw out. What's understanding breakthrough cases going thing? remember anyone saying vaccines 100% effective. essentially vaccinated. Covid gonna take knee breathing apparatus. I'm entirely sure works given major religions I'm aware come vaccine.

In US considerable case law predating pandemic says religion, First Amendment purposes, matter individual conscience require endorsement organization; number others sharing belief relevant.  would religion even 'come vaccine'? Except Catholic Church almost none religions centralized, there's ton branches Christianity, Islam Judaism within groups vaccine one way another. Depends vaccine. moderna, vaccine teaches body recognize spike protein virus uses foreign body segregate destroy it.

The vaccine make immune system stronger. body doesnt ability make enough antibodies doesnt matter vaccine cause dont resources fight effectively. wonder many zoo animals pets getting vaccinated? unfortunate headline two weeks now. Hopefully start improving vaccination numbers remain low optimistic. Lol please tell picked 300% effective bad math joke 80-90% actually could wrong here, think either FDA CDC required participants longer evaluation timeframes younger group. came middle trial. literature many days booster take build immunity decent levels? Booster scheduled Sunday (11/21) Im thinking traveling internationally 26th 27th. Want ensure week good enough. get bunch travel vaccines one point time 3 one arm 1 another row! Felt like arm got 3 punched transport truck days after. hear you, idk feel strange getting “illegally” 4 year old 2 year old. makes angry oldest one wanting go school activities like ballet. don’t even feel safe taking park. It’s frustrating. I’m thinking signing online school see things go wish could give social interaction. well expect virus? requires spending money billionaires currently hoarding select shore accounts. Jesus go Walgreens get fucking booster. zero New Jersey. swear headlines fuel anti Vaxxers Covid deniers share St. Louis, Missouri, vaccinated hospitalizations 13-18% August. shifted month end October peaking 30% hospitalizations among vaccinated. booster rollouts, we've shifted back 26% declining. can't speak vaccine's effectiveness hospitalizations percentage that's affect metro hospitals. We're seeing hospitalizations increase decline (but decline enough reset us pre-Delta late spring/early summer) keep boosters, we're major strain medical systems people could rely outpatient treatments (antibodies, home oxygen) going also suffer. actually think testing moderna 6mos 5yo now. maybe it'll even younger thought. People still predicting this, thread right now. I'm saying they're wrong, hard keep hearing ""this last bad wave highly vaccinated areas"" still believe true. good amount will. definitely close initial numbers. also vary live.

For example, suburb 70k, 84% FIVE 1 shot. 91% 12 over. 6 year old 7 11 year old cousins went together get first jab today. Well, put cats around whole bunch unvaccinated kids expect would happen? irresponsible. Humans horrible pandemics.  They're outdoors. Transmission negligible. Stuck? seven day average going last week US. 78,000 7-day average multiple 100,000+ days week 70,000. Europe preview. Even Portugal high vaccine rates warmer weather there's slight uptick starting emerge family/friends preparing upcoming surge.  Outdoor Christmas markets ridiculous luxury! sad, especially endangered already.  Americans bad math associated risk assessment though. 1-2% death rate super high, people dumb something recognize that. 1% 330 million 3.3 million...  NJ won’t let :( guess could lie say underlying condition… jumped well initially, still suffered subsequent waves.

What's high-vaccination country? Portugal 86.6% fully vaccinated.  There's experiencing new mini-wave new cases daily 7-day average doubled.

Obviously vaccines game-changer, I'm saying went months talking vaccines+infection immunity would end pandemic certain threshold reached.  understand relevance breakthrough cases, could get COVID multiple times. always waves, they’re driven public perception. things good people take les precautions spread increases. things get really bad people cautious leading less spread. People reactive keep masking/limiting contact way down. Eventually cases relatively low people feel safe again. Fewer precautions whole cycle starts again. 

That consistently takes 4-5 months wave indicative pattern. disagree 2 thing. Babies crave social interactions, showed clear interest starting around 9 months old. would agree age lowered around 1 year old.

Right we're kind collectively, conveniently, shrugging shoulders fact kids 5 can't get vaccinated. understand, still severely disappointed.  vaccination % need hit prevent another wave winter? I'm watching EU higher vaccination rates best states, concerning. keep hearing next wave last. summer Delta wave last. winter Delta wave.

I'm trying argumentative, I'm trying understand people basing predictions on? Yeah, lucky planned accordingly, able wife home first year returning work. put son daycare September 2020, little year “baby room” 8 weeks 1-1.5 years old moved next room. 

My cousins kids hand, 8 weeks back work, go. daycare. Embarrassing? That's undeserved. think supposed that... country officials said expect 5th wave time pandemic unvaccinated fear new variant may come might resistant vaccines. Since (yesterday basically) told live rest life next week end. vaccinated though, faith left humanity want make best years left - I'm early 20's since ""you never know"" said ""i think know I'm going today!"" Low vaccination rates. ended lockdowns vaccination rate least 80% (double vaxxed) made mandatory health care workers etc fully vaccinated. Australia initially problems getting vaccines country 82.5% double vaccination rate whole country. live (NSW) reached 91% double vaccination rate 8.2 million population. know, morons. zero-covid strategy precisely criticizing. impossible task alienating country, costing incredible amount, delaying development realistic strategy. 

Regarding vaccines, responding previous comment stating vaccines ""fairly weak."" point US, particularly Northeast, boosters antibodies readily available, pills coming, nearly one needs concerned virus. Certainly enough shut borders. corrected comment later. think politicians Germany aligned believe effectiveness social distancing vax roll out. However, strong share population anti vax politicians (and have) impose stricter rules increase vaccination rates. couple idiotic friends want vaccine, thanks Germany count numerous avoidable deaths. winter tough! LAPD proving rules apply everyone except smh Lincoln Nebraska college town usually votes blue.   Get grip dude.   moderna J&amp;J seem better lasting response. extrapolating anything data I’d get J&amp;J 2 months later get moderna booster.  agree more. wish started end month something. Thank you. I’m ok.  CDC FDA literally data yet. hell talkin' about?  problem waning immunity, countries need either commit widespread booster distribution face another winter wave. Infection chances plummets Pfizer booster given Israel proof scaled  C’mon, you’re dramatic. kids need close enough. it’s children’s zoo. know happens children’s zoo? Show-and-tell letting.

But failed.

Frankly, tired holding society back.

We need move past them, whether want move future not. figure? research saw COVID #1 cop killer last two years. Serious question, ""case rate"" still meaningful metric vaccinated?   true. county 65% vaccinated zip code 46%. it’s LAPD, new hires get 3 free kills sort consequences.     Last heard something low like that. idea got people go get vaccinated though.  I'm Upstate NY, went shot bit week ago, give reasons qualify said anyone 6 months good go. Government run place, empty store mall. understand breakthrough cases going thing, could get COVID multiple times.

Exactly! two things said.

1. Breakthrough cases
2. Reinfections

I think currently atmosphere politically incorrect talk two, eventually people admit issue.

Currently world seems phase ""let's ramp vaccination percentage really high pretend over"". Well, sadly might be. seems virus still thrive.

The vaccines still really good preventing one winding ICU. That's one thing well. already plenty non-ICU hospitalizations occurring vaccinated people.

&amp;#x200B;

basically whole german state designed gouvernment can´t force people something chancellor can´t much regarding health things, compared individual federal states.

Plus contrast countries ""list keeping"" seriously prohibited lot things real statistics vaccianted. ended lockdowns vaccination rate least 80%

Most Europe started year lockdown due alpha variant. many countries, weren’t enough vaccines fully vaccine 80% population August/September. really saying stayed lockdown eight months? 

My country exited lockdown March, many months, things calm, hospitals strain covid. don’t see could possibly justify staying lockdown circumstances. 

Also, infections hospitalisations really accelerated reached 80% fully vaccinated I’m sure difference would made stay lockdown then, except spirits economy would destroyed eight-month lockdown. makes mad hell. saying since many weeks, got downvotes far LOL Hard believe others lack level foresight. National effort? Try US  we've seen movie times now.. gonna bad winter. boosters masks help Curious: also unsympathetic vaxxed get breakthrough cases, unvaxxed? UK similar vaccination rate, bit far dead people past. therefore far people immunization infection.

Germany had, compared UK, comperatively low absolute numbers infections (and therefore death rates). Without restrictive measures even lockdowns, match terms death rates. Sounds like town, except even fewer vaccinated. work big store town everyone goes miles around. Hardly workers vaxxed everyone seems hate masks. bad summer too. think people areas like counted learn mistakes. mean, matter? still get breakthrough infections meaning COVID policies never go away. actually public health system pretty good, par private system  Constitution applies states way applies federal government. Jacobson literally mandate. It’s almost identical case.

Im glorifying case, I’m explaining law is. I’m aware Buck v. Bell.

The law settled. first time vaccine mandates made won’t last time. really isn’t complex issue. government positive duty protect citizens threats. Covid threat. 

Sorry dude, simple. According Type 2 worse Type 1, else equal. according mortality affected poorly controlled well controlled blood sugar levels, poorly controlled lot fatal. could confounder - people Type 1 typically better controlled blood sugar.  Maybe IATA, I'm bit miffed mom asking take precautions travel plane visit sister Thanksgiving. mom immunocompromised third dose, completing normal vaccine series, sister already boosters (not immunocompromised), afforded excellent protection COVID. mom dad traveling nonstop since left college--they've many airports public spaces knows fact they're asking precautions mega-vaxxed family thanksgiving annoys considering they've done. sorry rant I'm comparing whole,

France also better rest Europe Cops ultra Karens. differentiated, I'd assume either. Considering average age death US, may lean towards type 2, mean type 1 diabetics effected. r/angryupvote data you. Also, ""A trio studies Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) today show COVID vaccines protect well Delta (B1617.2) variant, unvaccinated people 5 times risk infection 10 times risk hospitalization death compared vaccinated people."" kinds awesome. found headline stimulating can’t seem come around agree.

Like, yes, might end needing many boosters many years. might every 6 months rest life. 

But end day, risks covid outweigh risk vaccine (which practically always will), worth getting anyway right? get this, problem health care systems founded, running strain even covid. maybe problem it’s much covid healthcare founding. mean, new antivirals coming probably keep people hospital. still … Thank seeing point. toll thing taking sick it. brutal think undiagnosed illnesses occurring, people scared get checked things normally would, etc. effects thing felt far longer virus itself. Exactly opposite. really good data show misinformation driving vaccine resistance primarily white communities communities color. General mistrust medical industry (based personal experiences and/or experiences people know), lack access health care settings, fear interacting authorities prevalent migrant communities communities color. words, ways reach farm worker migrant communities significantly increase vaccination rates, thoughtful reduce barriers. problem misinformation vaccines politicized mostly white problem. Except employer gets tax deduct benefits provide. That's prefer give benefits rather higher salaries. I'm trying get head around came conclusions. Germany somewhat similar vaccination rates UK. Even best case scenario they're predicting 500ish dead day? make sense UK seen numbers they've basically pretending virus gone now. I’m deeply curious going work practice. anti vaxxers claiming it’s global conspiracy suppress freedoms feel vindicated double down. many times getting posted? I've calculated current R=1.2 current numbers infections.  vaccines crucial, wish people willing mask public winter. get people want to, helps. many people get angry it, Covid care feel.  understand overlook crippling debt hospital stay since there's serious overlap unvaccinated, poor ""socialized"" medicine. guess they'll pull Bootstraps pay half million dollar medical bill walk hospital alive?  Yeah wondering well. 

The thing R0 Delta variant large (around 7) even sizeable reduction transmission around 75% vaccination cannot alone push R 1. turn means things like masks, and, least winter, also reducing contacts probably necessary next future.

Public opinion Germany seems flipping mandatory vaccination. think would positive thing, neighbour countries like France Italy know protests half un-vaxed people proceed get vaccine, make real difference. incredible! Great job Right even people care health, ever happened common courtesy? trouble believing people know uncomfortable around unmasked people coughing global pandemic.

Far many far corrupt, sucking corporations, making unsuited actual problem solving. aren’t kids Australia kids anywhere else? one country’s view good enough all? doubt visitors. There's lots barriers large cats. likely staff.  Deaths UK horrific, modest. prolonged shedding infectious virus days immunocompromised patient evidence continuous mutational evolution virus vivo suggests persistence viable replication-competent virus long periods certain circumstances.

That scares most...

But: children displaying brain matter destruction level adults...that really makes sad. good reason get Vaxxed yet? Still waiting UK problem majority hospital beds occupied minority unvaccinated people, medical system collapses many suffer consequences free decisions. money? Good. Oh know. point even try anymore. worth argument. gonna higher absolute numbers. 

Bingo. wanna limit circulation too. cannot see similarities. get that. Comparisons hard sometimes. great day. treatment grounds race, gender, age nationality, religion unconstitutional. 

Who said race, gender, age, nationality religion? made example obesity. mandatory vaccination this? said I'd rather strong mandates selective lockdown also freedom get vaccinated bullshit. Maybe cause like 95% total population Israel? OFC gonna higher absolute numbers. really making non arguments. comparison complete nonsense. nothing agree here. claim absurd bs refute  Decent chunk unvaxxed VA, Medicare Medicaid. free them.

These infamous ""Get government medicare"" people Sitting inside unmasked long period time high risk. could wish. 





Jk saddens deeply. Poor animals. spell good things imo. Thats case. Unequal treatment grounds race, gender, age nationality, religion unconstitutional. Unequal treatment grounds refusing vaccination not. Never isnt even precedent already mandatory vaccinations 50s 60s hospitalisation circulation? 

If circulation high, hospitalisation also gonna high. btw, data Israel countries also show months vaccine efficacy infections gets little - vaccinated people end pretty much incidence rate unvaxxed, means contribute circulation proportionally same, also wayyy absolute terms. sense we’re going agree. I’m saying communicable virus, habits passed one another friend group beyond. agree. Everyone choice (in case). Back company corner, they’ll get rid people problem. Back group people corner, then…well…I’m sure if/when they’ll lash back.

My humor vax/unvax exchange lack compassion (not saying you’re compassionate, others thread are). want go path, force (jail people, tie people vax them) see happens. flying airplane North America security headache actually takes away joy used get flying?

Mandatory seat belts thing.

As Canadian I'm also pro gun control.

People trade liberty security time different. live society, make decisions benefit entirety society! find hilarious. Like, super powerful secret organization wants kill half people Earth they've spent untold resources getting nearly every doctor immunologist virologist planet lie everyone. That's route decided take? Really? sneak slow acting poison water supply? There'd publicity, nobody resisting protesting, nobody would know there'd 100% success *everybody* needs water. Look vaccination rates US, they're terrible, plan force everyone take injection kill several years working.

Not mention, make whole new pandemic that's going scrutinized everyone Earth could've put whatever poison thousands types injections people get time? Flu shots vaccinations, insulin, Botox, local anesthetics. mean vast global conspiracy must already doctors board lying it, cause mass panic draw attention plan? worst, incompetent evil organization ever lmao. reply doctor part statement, truth, talk professional give exemption fears valid. agree exempt get jab. googling reliable years education support doctor has. 

Also quick google search shows medical exemptions thing EU, however lieu vaccinated provide recent negative test go anywhere/do anything mentioned. exemption would able continue using negative tests pass. think could simply close exhibit would fine. There's need shut entire zoo.  not. got flu shot separate like 3 weeks ago. I'm feeling little better, yeah one got good. remember second shot much, several co-workers couple days. guess maybe reaction depends fast mRNA gets incorporated cells. wonder cell energy create defences makes us tired side effect. supposed basically make body behave like attacked. Well succeed time. hospitalisation circulation? hospitalisation doesnt mean ICU. Austria isnt even high vaxx country. relative value still way high regarding share general population. opportunity get vaccine chose to. Leopard anti-vaxer. deserves die.

Am right? Habits. friend. Habits contagious. overconsumption causes issues health system. Heart disease. Liver damage. Well glad see it’s largely global problem, bunch “feeble minded” (as article puts it) peeps US. originally concerned mental health nation guess people exist everywhere around world. precedent stripping group ""like"", perceive threat, basic freedoms. Good move, think increase vaccination significantly. decline looks lot like Florida's. think burned through.

One thing tho', peak lot smoother. horrific. 

So...they must *something* right. 

If could figure was! setting precedent. Thats intented work. cant claim sets dangerous precedent going way intented do. 

Like precedent what? I’m astounded people believe this. worked COVID ward teaching hospital. colleagues vaccinated. Hundreds medical residents vaccinated. one died (duh). What's hard understand unvaccinated *not* responsible virus circulation, *especially* highly vaccinated populations. comparing relative proportion absolute value.

In example Ireland, two thirds patients hospital 60. 60 fully vaxxed there. people global supply chain rising inflation due covid. Maybe help understand need get this.

Lying people something big going make people trust government. going make believe government less.   work pharmacy pediatric doses. Friday Saturday (not open Sunday) busiest days. kids shots either, lots parents getting first dose along kids. maybe get new vet. think AZ highest death rate time thing Yeah thats want lockdown unvaccinatedc responsible virus circulation. hard understand  Mmmm. Got mine Friday + Flu. Slept Saturday. I'm fine now. Even went 45 minute walk morning. Completely worth it. say infringed. said extremely dangerous precedent stand that. great step finally taking control virus. world governments come together finally something people. thats irelevant since vaccinated persons way lower change land ICU 

Yes, proportionally do.

However, due demographics vaccinated, viral circulation highly vaccinated population grows patients ICUs vaccinated. Again, Singapore pre-third dose Israel good examples this. hugely hypocritical argue problem unvaxxed contagious.

Oh, btw, pretty strong case limiting freedom vaccinated - vaccine evading variant likely emerge among them. Good. hard, ask people essential services vaccine proof get fined. 

Plenty people get away breaking law say drunk drivers deterrent. that, people die delayed treatment (for cancer, example) lack health workers (because forced quit). person interviewed leader health center. likely vaccinated likely working hard people region, like work him. much understand feelings forgotten left behind; rest state able move forward health center continues heads. everyone regions refusing get vaccinated take vaccine put uncomfortable position put odds community. don’t envy situation all. Time.

Between big spike case numbers spike resulting hospitalizations (and deaths) there’s period time. Yeah supreme court austria finds law unconstitutional (which dont believe) null void. Thats exactly system intented work rule law principle democracy infringed upon? Curious see plays out. tried US would civil war That's inaccurate analogy. like terrorist hostage, Stockholm syndrome full effect.

Again, Nestle moral/ethical right thing, trying convince customers responsibility. That's grade-A gaslighting seems fallen ruse well.

The reality is, seems interested reality, people completely oblivious damage they're causing due disinformation psychological manipulation. actually look issue plastics causing environment categorically sidelined, mocked. why?

The answer is, part subversion corporations engage protect status quo. something new...it's tactic Lords using Feudalism well. Never stoke envy among proletariat...never allow workers unite together you....have fighting instead.

The fact snarky combative something simple straight forward says all, either unknowingly unwittingly agent corporation Feudalism 2.0. duped believing customer's full responsibility, ones manufacturing plastics, fully aware impacts. never due cleverly effectively indoctrinated disagree other.

So basically saying....keep status quo. coming together this. surrounded people cannot convinced otherwise. corporations front. entire argument EFFECTIVELY protect status quo. parliament approve sorts things. There's countless instances approved laws later found breach constitutional foundations anyway. Latvia said they're gonna ban unvaxxed voting (!). I'm mostly talking implications kind choices. rejoice want, unvaxxed easy target, probably gonna bite us ass soon enough. going get tough sex workers... thats irelevant since vaccinated persons way lower change land ICU entire point measurement. spike start? Usually deaths lag cases. Give weeks. I’m guessing need time put everything place give people chance get vaccinated Freedom choice freedom consequences. incidence rises thanks huge part willfully unvaccinated people logical ristrict people creating new wave. big policy u turn Russia. Previous policy pretend like nothing happening hope goes away. Happy see finally something protect people afraid of? I'm embarrassed point. Grown men women afraid tiny needle. need psychological help face armed criminals scared simple medical treatment.

The ironic part people (most cops included) put much much worse things bodies willingly. drugs, alcohol junk food. Vaccinated people contagious too. fact proportionally less contagious unvaxxed kinda irrelevant given there's also much them. That’s true, people choice get vaxxed it’s fair employers get choice works workplace.  That’s it’s going take really keep virus check. Pretending like it’s get back “normal” going go well. US point feels like sink swim. Survival fittest. None contagious. I've learned several schools around area (Florida) hiring COVID contact tracers. possible trying take laborious work nurses' shoulders.   democracy rule law works? parliament approved law. somebody thinks rights unjustified infringed upon sue. 

Seems like wanted use buzzwords. ???? drive influence time get caught, consequences. think you’re conflating free choice lack consequences.

Not saying agree this, Austria doesn’t seem many options left employers turfing people aren’t vaxxed, I’m sure that’s going true much longer. send article vet .....
They've known now. variants going keep coming. need inexpensive, effective treatment actually get sick. way think end. bet, follow bliss Also, least US, HCWs burnt out. Many retiring early, quitting. stay often going travel contracts hospitals pay them… hospitals afford pay staff, leaves rural community hospitals left underfunded also short staff. Use spoiler tag! Haha Definitely since it’s complete lockdown, still go work, school, grocery shopping, health appointments. 

They can’t participate social activities like going restaurant, movies, nightclubs, etc. sad Wait someone gets vaccinated actually sex brothel free? vote target obesity liquor/THC forced vaccinations. rule take care people; three ones would next line. 

It seems it’s people want.  good news! effective treatment covid infection could game changer. Fingers crossed Wherein still look far worse world? Northern Europe seeing surges bringing line UK months months.

Compared say Germany since replying UK deaths per day (7 day average) like 25% less population month ago UK almost double deaths per day far less population. look France comparison even worse. Without even getting true high performers COVID.

 UK constant rolling disaster COVID, guys normalized global warning marker rest us happen fuck up. That.... 
;)  end goal safe get infected doesn’t bring COVID home immunocompromised person. Breakthrough infections happen home prolonged contact. 

She wants herself. It’s caring others seems question here.   ""fuck all"" terms *greater spread* terms community. 

Not actual person's immediate interest. Fellow T1, spot on. Never named close, back never overweight obese population. 

This misunderstanding bad, nurses get it; normal doctors dont react right away; sh*t show time. LADA onset 28, passing blood glucose last Thing checked ""fit profile""

Don't forget friendly neighbourhood Aunts friend diabetic Cinamon CURE !  would die would get vaccinated wear mask. 

In fact, number one cause death among cops. issue they're refusing get vaccinated wear masks, they're pulling people detaining (whether lawfully not) potentially exposing tens thousand citizens daily, more. train? severe lack available nurses. literally one available. agree affects others. That’s whole problem here. wasn’t highly infectious communicable disease dealing here, would agree.

Your right swing fist stops nose. It’s reason can’t scream, “fire” crowded theater. greater good always factor. Even higher obese think…or least overweight.  Uh, said one shot ""fuck all"". chart link shows people partially vaccinated much better unvaccinated. So, ""fuck all"".

I agree stupid get fully vaccinated one shot that's said.  alternative full lockdown everyone. know bill rights like Austria, jurisdiction courts ruled government must use least-infringing rules achieve public good. Austrians *more free* result policy alternative ways save healthcare system. foolish. vaccines work effectiveness wanes.  are. point get vaccinated ( save ourselves) somehow twist minds looking greater good . Yes,we are, fact side benefit acting protecting ,which sole intention. heroes .  disagree, fourth amendment gives people right person, opinion means medical freedom. scares me. trauma based extreme phobia, extreme I've refused surgery simple problem may become lethal, extreme prepped blood test A&amp;E put state psychotic break paranoid delusions spent entire day front balcony window, convinced took eyes road second men white coats would pull in, section take away right say IV treatment. I've asked time time treatment NHS anything me, little offered done nothing. can't get vaccinated everyone immediately assumes I'm anti vax 'look away' I'm vaxxed. I'm sure trying point out.

If part says vaccine infections 4.x likely unvaccinated fully vaccinated 2.x unvaccinated partially vaccinated, made comment clarifying yes *partially vaccinated process getting vaccinated* somewhat protective.

The issue people gotten one shot intention getting second shot lot data offer lasting immunity. Woah calm there, 4 years ago. Nothing covid, don’t always blindly trust doctor. It’s low containing Delta seen numbers equally 90% vaccinated required. I’m sure Germany vaccinating kids reservoirs spreaders. Mhm, yeah makes sense. Thanks. risk 3 shots sister 3 shots

What's end goal shots cant participate ""high risk"" activities? haven’t seen much unvaccinated passionately hate vaccinated? hate goes ways. realize Covid literally causes pneumonia hospitalization right offering party preference data

So admit disprove claim. Free vouchers enter brothel, free sex. literally stops virus ever getting infection level, never ""get"" covid. spreading myths?   Exactly. wish didn’t people downvoting posts. TWiV best source I’ve found. Countries high vaccination rates still high rates covid. know vaccinated *can* spread it.

Im sure actual extent vaccination reduces spread two facts seems clear effect fairly modest country people vaccinated infections likely come vaccinated.

Obviously rate vaccination plays role 80% Austrian adults least 1 dose 75% fully vaccinated.

That assumption comes from. better information happy hear it. Lol seen Austria's infection rate? We're ro break so-far record 100% (~9,600 daily infections last November vs 16,000 daily week, probably still increasing). hospital staff brink burnout year. ICUs already reached full capacity many many patients expected coming weeks.

One biggest problems lot people vaccination also get tested. totally agree. parents third world country, really unbelievable good portion fellow Americans voluntarily refusing free, widely available vaccine others outside country desperate have. Florida. 57. Lived without insurance 20 years, I'm playing catch-up immunizations. 

So glad feeling better! Hurrah! Hurray immune COVID dread! won't. populistic decision populistic government. Experts immediately assess measure meaningless.

Since policing consequence.  That's cery likely sound like taking precautions. don’t think they’ve ever ran patient vent/hospitalized also breakthrough case. keep reading boosters available everyone I'm 28 8 months 2nd shot, eligible? Want know “ secret “ Japan it?

They “we” mentality  see truly enforced. Family gathering still happen often infection happens going exorbitant? need stop obsessing cases. Zero COVID valid policy, living COVID immensely reduced risk sensible path forward. course, means peak mid-August, death rate among unvaccinated people 13.23 100,000 people.****Rates vaccinated people dramatically reduced, 3.14, 1.43 0.73 Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Moderna, respectively.*** *""*

And useful comparison 1.8 per 100k

5-17: 0.3 per 100k

18-49: 1.6 per 100k

50-64: 9.1 per 100k

65+: 22.1 per 100k

Different flu seasons better/worse others, society live flu large spend untold hours sweating wondering possibly go living midst. blows mind 185 upvotes (as 4 hours). Imagine showing people start 2020.

Everyone done shit. Germany completed metrication process least. live? old you? MMR, Tdap part standard immunization schedule? Anyway, headache almost little body aches now. I'm going go clean house. I’m sure you’d less likely get covid first place? explain vaccinated main people spreading this

source? carry research though, basing advice on. Multiple vaccine manufacturers lawsuits advising unnecessary medicine people (even opioids), pay billions, definitely don’t always win them. 
I’m obviously saying “””research””” (mega quotes) enough overrule doctors advice, I’m saying right doubt it, since I’ve given wrong advice before, resulted hospitalized pneumonia. 
Another disclaimer, I’m “antivaxx”, I’m saying I’m still doubting take it, knowing I’m specific case. heart perforation way. allowed go church

for know, churches never hosted super spreader events, super important keep economy going /s  done time. called Triage, likely survive treated, expectant left. Vaccinated people much higher chance survival unvaccinated. like fucking without condom daily getting HIV test week means travel average person met I'd rather forego free sex. might even prefer Covid.  past trying reason them? conspiracy theorist matter anyway do, they'll invent narrative it, consistent pet conspiracy theory. I've before:

&amp;#x200B;

Rich people taking vaccine: see? vaccine good rich would first ones get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Rich people getting vaccine: see? rich people part masonic cabala lizard aliens get rich selling mind controlling vaccines, look trying convince us take it.   baby early 2020. lucky get 2 4 month vaccines start end first wave, babies appointments middle cancelled due lack nursing staff (reassigned work care homes). We've lucky colds illnesses delay vaccine appointments hard re-schedule, oldest getting flu vaccine next week since previous vaccine cancelled due covid test cold. far know actually evidence effectively are, ie overweight friends likely become overweight yourself, etc. Nono, I’m saying doesn’t decrease hospitalization rate, obviously does. I’m saying chance hospitalized may higher take vaccine. Another point longer allowed take every vaccine except Pfizer, might prohibiting too. It’s whichever happens first, mandate exempt. People rag lot missing specific timeframes dates, think he's generally track. thing uniform country, different states get ""big Delta"" hit different times, usually coordinating weather gets crap big social gathering events occur. FL July trash weather, July VT heck lot nicer. FL south looking great need cluster inside live, north opposite.

One thing need, especially post oral treatments, re-evaluation national psyche relates risk. We've collective trauma last year+, nation large heal done right things (vaccinate/boost) need able look mirror say ""It's safe live"" ""I need pretend Zoom holidays meaningful more"". need able feel *gut* fact safe reasonably expected white knuckle grip arm chair restaurant envisioning meal send us ICU.

A lot people intellectually know risk reduction post vaccination/booster, truly accepting deep inside. lizard brain part screaming risky, need find rock crawl back under. tenable, right, time recognize this. vaccination doesnt seem enough solve Covid, Ireland least *hospitalized patients* vaccinated, *ICU patients* unvaccinated. 93% vaccinated population means vaccination surely relieves great strain ICU capacity. it. waiting slippery slope argument, expect massive false equivalence one. Unless serious medical condition puts risk vaccines, really. heard compelling medical ethical arguments getting one types vaccines offer. amount helps protect you, community country think incentive enough. People buy one car example contributing pollution. People end hospital failed properly take care health medical system suffering. People shop non stop thus depleting earth natural resources.So many examples .

At least me, people somewhat selfish somewhat responsible. union pay pensions. city Absolutely correct. deaths. Even asymptomatic cases, finding reduced grey matter, IQ loss, blood clot biomarkers, long-term inflammation, psychiatric changes, they're still learning consequences. want children, doubt anyone else would. excellent - explanation need virus-specific protease inhibitors (i.e. old protease inhibitor help) great point people trying compare PAXLOVID Ivermectin off-base. Im curious know thinking behind this.

Presumably vaccinated main people spreading wont slow spread society general.

Is protect unvaccinated getting first place thereby reduce strain hospitals?

It seems told need lockdown politically difficult people vaccinated. expert opinion lockdowns unvaccinated think work, indeed do? stuck areas, rising. Yes, original idea work well. Delta came, people got tired many behave carelessly.

Without stopping spread possible enough beds now. reality. Hence talk stopping spread. feeling chosen vaccinated point keen following lockdown orders. trying make absurd strawmens. 

The current law constitutional cause contagious disease allows specific measurements. contagious disease unconstitional law changing would unconstitional too. 

The ""they could change law"" argument pointless. use anywhere everytime. system designed stop unconstitutional laws. rule law partly existing for. Austria sovereign Constitional court someone would try proposing example would tear new one. absolutely true. actually data interested finding it. Here's   No, I'm batting either side. must American. waiting? sure inexpensive, we're 2. One Merck one Pfizer.

Hopefully things keep going smoothly those.

Then need good accessible rapid tests easy get tested take pills first sign illness effective.   report it. going regardless know false unsustainable. problem never going reach 100% vaccination, long significant number unvaccinated people there, widespread transmission going mean flooded hospitals.

We may able eradicate thing (or might… countries Asia managing keep cases pretty rare), need measures least slow spread. Unless make vaccination compulsory, slowing spread way prevent hospitals flooded. anti-viral pills coming soon. make huge difference. feel bad daughter, fact wasted ICU bed 20 days still save life shows *exactly* throw towel people.  vaccination certificates phones. theory could asked show trying enter facility. one reasons Russia showing visible efforts subverting Brazil regions surrounding it. people absorbing Russian propaganda easily Europe US, problematic make harder get goid feel things going too. Adding cases past makes current trend look better should.  booster getting? two shots Pfizer earlier year side effects aside sore arm times. Yesterday, got Moderna booster, knocked out. Sore arm, fatigue, fever, chills. planned could rest full day shot case, I’m glad did. still get make choice. face consequences choice.

Also, super hate vaccines help herd immunity protect disabled people something able-bodied people get make choice about. They're *just* choosing health, they're choosing gamble people's health *lives* that's okay.

So someone wants anti-vax, fine, get walk around impunity risking people's lives carry like nothing's changed.

This whole ""it's health choice"" nonsense wildly giving ""fuck disabled people"" energy. thing disabled is: long enough timeline, every single person becomes disabled person. Cool, get job vaccine requirement then, sounds like following rules need. Or, want maintain job mandate vaccine, get vaccine. hard. They're literally giving option ""if like it, quit"". I'm sure happily used argument life. go - like it, quit.  would call nimble

But tropical country, people living tropical countries forced accept reality serious infectious disease useful vaccines be.

Aside people follow witchdoctors Islamic extremists (neither common Brazil), tropical countries tend anti vax movements. American way. sith deals absolutes. using similar apps US, guess majority population isn’t aware places requiring vaccination. used Clear app last week get conference Denver, example.  People face death bravely hypothetical. Super easy look macho breathing machine thinking never seeing loved ones ever. 

These people unreal. I've seen thing friends family vaccine. something trifled with. Munich, incident rate vaccinated people around 80, unvaccinated 407... *Richest country HISTORY world... may not. Nobody enforce China- Singapore-like measures Western countries. Forget it.

Those vaccinated get infected obtain natural immunity, which, latest studies show, also gives substantial degree protection relevant outcomes future. also get boosters older people and, yes, restrictions unvaxxed. perfectly enough. also new medicaments treatment might support this.

The virus become endemic, eventually everyone get it, that's fine.

It’s always “they can’t this! rights they’re taking away rights! Blah blah…. Government consipiracy” know, know... always special kind problem around pandemic really amplified it. Pathological lethargy kind little epidemic decades now. lists statistical analyses. see HCQ performing exact placebo points exception death day 15 performs 25% worse placebo.

and day 28 added deaths ECMOs (since basically dead, sad say, point) HCQ placebo

you keep going past see HCQ folks seizures, Afib, double cardiac arrest, much higher rates anemia, thrombo, overall longer recover.

if look section statistical analysis says ""estimated value"" see number, usually 1.1, 0.95, 1.2 kind thing shows much better worse HCQ compared placebo. confidence interval, could increased study large numbers people would expect given results 95% time. see numbers like 0.5-1.5 0.9-1.1 something along lines.

the gist HCQ rarely better placebo outcomes better, conclusively better. 27 minutes? happen now, future, regardless NoCovid extremists want. virus endemic, shall accept move on. police union said last week, ain't job check vaccination status people. days ago sounded different they'll check randomly now. see saying really thing Im claiming.

I dont read german assume number positive tests. vaccinated, people generally take tests symptoms vaccinated course makes far likely symptoms.

Thats thing infectious though. would herd immunity now, right? That’s people general friend. *socialised    Thats longer case Europe. Cases rising among vaccinated.

The opposite true Austria now: Cases steeply rising among unvaccinated, slightly falling among vaccinated. hospitals need require proof vaccination receive treatment Covid. problem would correct months. really wish could send vaccine places need it. area 80% vaccinated vaccine freezer. allowed send anywhere antivaxxer might change mind. Florida spike last winter though much smaller Delta spike.   Yes...it's nuts Seriously? silly. virus endemic every country, countries ease restrictions whilst going winter, virus shoot up. Let's forget many countries eastern europe/ russia low vaccination rates massively under-testing look positivity rates compared UK. Kill people?  Yes

Get vaccine? Oh hell no! That's fully true. smaller kids, 14 wear masks classrooms. hallways kids wear masks. Even ground school wearing them, doubt rule strict.

The rules changing depending number infections. true, wear masks time. thought Germany excellent leadership science communication? Why?  US going look like week Thanksgiving?

Hope not. I'm getting booster next week though, so. agree. really start make unvaccinated morons pay treatment. would bare minimum. repeating One less well understood aspects US constitutional structure many things states bounds federal government. unvaccinated responsible majority virus circulation, wide margin: solid lines cases among unvaccinated, dotted lines vaccinated.   hate you. terrible day eyes. Take upvote get fuck Probably like hundreds. Everyone pretty quickly get idea. That's point deterrence.

And unvaxxed, unvaxxed disobeying control measures.  weeks ago highest numbers new corona cases western states Germany. highest numbers East South states ones least amount vaccinated people. think death rate increasing much right now. worst vaccinated state East 57.4 % population fully vaccinated. Even 60+ age group 79.0 % vaccinated. virus hitting states least prepared really shows. churches super spreaders. surprised go. cut singing That’s article cities. I’m phone can’t much googling article/video it. pointed real-world evidence Israel shows ""people get vaccinated get infected spreading within household spreading outside would imply vaccines good reducing spread low interaction, however get household, that’s different ball game. that’s seeing high profile things like football teams, White House staff, etc… 

I’m sure people argue this. think football teams fully vaccinated individuals exception rules spreads full vaxed population like wildfire? control get back semblance normal life

For vaccinated people least!  Except tons precedent federal government things left states completely legal got creative it. See drinking ages. It’s really lockdown. restrictions big gatherings such. still go store, work, exercise outdoors, visit family, etc. suggest science based alternative curb current wave? Tokyo live, everyone’s masked public transport outdoors, there’s little space social distance. However cases still currently low, likely getting population vaccinated quickly. 

I don’t think there’s need obsess you’re vaccinated get booster shot needed, that’s me. Many vaccines mandatory going school, medical worker, military, etc US yet there's group anti-covid vax... conversations always go way, responsible. say matter. sides interested division. point got place people proud break relationships differences opinion, etc. Everyone wants echo chamber. That's cool, can't surprised outcomes. well understand one side much less reasonable. difficult situation.  Play checkers. Absolutely nothing. Go get ‘em tiger! Pretty similar Trump... unfortunately sizable chunk 40-45% approved fanatics enough drive anti-vax vaccine-hesitant sentiments many parts country.  ""nightmare"" asking someone driver's license? Really, see issue there. [Who knew public funded heathcare system could achieve, also speak Portuguese Portugal one top 3 countries vaccinations. even they're facebook/twitter, Portugues versions likely pro-vax. surprise there. Americans would Rather kill people get shot They're antisocial. would great asocial would mean interact anyone infect them.

It primarily due bad mask wearing. People socialising far greater degree stage pandemic. Yes. Everyone chance protect either vaccinating or, older sick people, taking booster. someone not, that's them. state's protection obligations end there.

Boost, restrict unvaccinated lockdown Austria, get 3G workplace 2G everyone else. perfectly sufficient. Incompetent purpose   absolutely can’t imagine kidney infection flu time, must hell So, think ICUs overrun people OK long unvaccinated?

Do believe necessary give virus free run order end deal pandemic? They're exactly competitive original Delta though, expect disappear! Everyone equally responsible.

I'm adult, I've gotten fear vaccines get flu shot every year. gotten yet recently got booster shot. wanted get time, pharmacist said location that, arm sore want get another shot yet. next day though I'm getting it. Boooooooooo 👎🏼 100% sick rampant ignorance politicization science medicine. can't express badly wish could leave US. historically one highest rates hesitancy  don’t believe restrictions, done something entirely inhumane.

Our focus build prepare infrastructure future challenges. COVID shown, massively fragile healthcare systems are. going overlook fact facing different viruses waves? Good idea. I’ll see that! mean **original** Delta. Oh, would really prefer clear vaccination mandate. already late wave, would obviously help. people think need way 'keep face'. think many wont vaccinate, vocal vaccinating clear mandate would easy way it. Glad know wasn’t one, sorry hear symptoms well. side effects said “joint aches” figured kind dull pain tend get one knees it’s going rain. prepared. Getting frustrated long taking approve boosters everyone 6 months including 12 up. gather adults approved soon, idea 12 can. teen 6 months weeks. He's school exposed daily Covid-19. masks real reported testing. frustrating. thank Fox News also thank CNN MSNBC guilty. record agree you.

Scott G's twitter link Israeli data November 9th. Come back tell think then. going Idaho soon hoping two shots enough. I'm planning never walk store anything there. booster trip, December.
I qualified booster full 6 pounds overweight. kind doubt that. Lines drawn. We’re beyond messaging point. Mandates children really thing going drive vaccination great extent. Yeah employer time, always concerned well corporate profits, told wouldn’t pay hotel room anymore didn’t come back. Drank close bottle NyQuil slept twelve hours. bed another three weeks, weren’t happy either. 

When healthy enough quit. One better decisions life. Dude, brain cancer. definition disabled. Maybe makes fatalist, offhand maybe realist? 

I don’t know, believe humans intrinsically selfish also easily manipulated fear, neither fantastic believe seen manipulation sides spectrum. COVID, least opened divide further.

That’s ultimately, selfish either sides determine they’re limited choice.

Pros cons exist, people weighed stuck believe best them. restrict them?

But moral idea behind sticks me. someone drink drives kills someone, theoretically they’re released prison vaccine full freedom, obtain another car? normal tax paying citizen, never committed crime vaccination, restrict them? somewhat become prison, freedom choice? 

A chance harm others exist, without vaccine, yes it’s slimmer vaccination, tallying everyday roll dice, really gives fuck deep side.

I think lot overblown, power grabs, progress science whole heap shit. Lots positives lots negatives.

But realistically, body, choice. still love thy neighbours vax not.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It’s ridiculous point. would feel government said get healthcare vaccinated get covid19? Haha. choose go social reasons, it’s statistically unsafe go. You’re supposed afraid point (or ever, really).

Insane times live in. shit like that's feeding antivaxers. Fire incompetent nurses. Romanian public finally awakened shame lowest vaccination rates Europe, shouting blaming started, eventually left front church steaming pile poo...

The church natural, started hosting small scale, PR vaccination events right front churches, sight perplexed believers. think reasonable/rational people realize security theatre appease zero-covid crowd. try moving US-No masks anywhere except cities! Like lockdowns freedom reducing. everything like 1 year ago except add ""if vaccinated"". good reason. *didn't* UK exception though. live France that’s case. case I’ve traveled Germany, Switzerland Italy last months :/ numbers starting rise again. point initial comment long told hold leeeeettle longer? dunno man, don’t buy anymore  Actually, quite. ""didn't use be"" technically correct even infelicitous. 

To employ ""used"" would need read, ""It used be."" That's kind sentence one might actually see Economist, pronounced plummy Oxbridge accent, sounds quite right. Even ethical concerns, wouldnt vaccinated person likely survive treatment, thus bumping triage priority? point show people's houses force inject people move on. important thing understand *not* psychological measure pressure people getting vaccinated. measure prevent covid patients overexceeding hospital capacity. hospitals full covid patients majority vaccinated. purpose lockdown protect unvaccinated, hospitals, patients need treatment. So, masks distancing forever then? Yeah looks good outside world. Thanks WHO. Old men farting problem also partisan America. Sounds scientific. stupid. Wrong country hombre scientific observation new coronavirus variants? fail geography? fail geography? true, there's always holiday spike. flu never huge problem Florida hospitals, whereas northern hospitals actually go alert it. Choices consequences. consequences. use interchangeably, often within sentence, trigger people 👌

Same color colour potato potato. Actually, that's great point, might well that. Surviving illness used require help others, meant people offered nothing harm world lives would find abandoned fate. Kind interesting, see play way vaccines. difference even pronounced among people aged 12-17: There, unvaccinated 5 times likely infected. Add fact students tested 2 3 times week (at least one PCR, often two). lower amount undetected cases, yet gap larger among students.

I agree there. interesting stat. hadnt realised systematically tested often. would definately think means vaccinated arent spreading much. Presumably age group.

Why dont countries 95% vaccination rates herd immunity though? Thats basically sceptical vaccine solution. least vaccines.  This. They're going concoct deranged conspiracy theory matter do, might well whatever's effective pound sand. live UK barely anyone wears masks now, feels like completely back normal. worn mask twice last 5 months, visiting someone hospital. OK denying access hospitals then? Otherwise use hospital space issues (disease, accident, etc) able receive normal care.

They can’t choice still get normal access medical care without rest population carrying burden. Yes, systematically irrelevant long boost majority older people. number hospitalizations would completely fact, average age people ICUs falling.

Yes, unvaccinated. Bayern still 75% unvaccinated ICUs basically everyone else either old seriously ill:  actually doubt that. Initially would outcry, everyone would get vaccinated people really notable side effects. people would stop caring move things get angry about. I've show get shows around LA. problem hand: Travel European countries limited two vaccines recognized Sinopharm EMA approval, granted emergency use World Health Organization (WHO), meaning handful European countries, including Austria Spain, accept it. Sputnik neither EMA approval, means EU, example, Hungary, Slovakia, Cyprus, Greece, accept proof immunization.  Well one's Austria soon read history quarantines. long history quarantining people visibly sick potential make problem worse. 

Heck, first quarantine rules locked tons healthy people port case might sick, known sick. 

That’s quarantine called quarantine. stems Italian words “40 days.” 40 days time people wait port arriving. Excellent. Crack vulnerable becoming hospitalized, people likely candidate spread virus victims faster. name getting shit wrapped faster, support this. unvaxxed public health threat. Lock em down.  Joe Rogan says so, true, right?

&amp;#x200B;

But here's line thinking. point, people unvaccinated, likely living virus nothing (attending larger gatherings, thus likely get virus). want around unvaccinated people. putting situations possibly get virus.  MD dealing antivaxxer: ""i'll get trouble anyone finds tell. heard Joe Rogan fart mouth, instantly get better. allowed tell people cure free farting right other's mouths. Wanna cured?"" like people think escape globalized society something what? majority feels they're threat, anti vaxxers locked punished criminals. That's society works. 

Like not, ""freedom"" society must maintain collective interests right, privilege granted others. ok that, go live hermit.  Funny enough, working really well countries socialized medicine kind proves point though. There's much states rights individual rights anti tracking bullshit federal record system.

Californians get vaccine records Google Pay Apple whatever. good system.

As card fitting standard size wallet, dumbest thing ever. region well know saying, ""Show papers."" think fine.   people mad China China. lockdown unvaccinated people, Austrian federal government also thinking night exit restrictions citizens. proposal table decision made next Wednesday, Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein told ORF.

Shame 💉 I’ve seen vaccine protests front hospitals. always saddens me. don’t want it, don’t get it. people want it, let get it. aren’t guilty. Studies shown right-perspective news sources biased news sources. CNN actually quite centrist slight left bias.

So view unpopular country Brazil wonder adopted gain favor Trump administration. actually isn't. Sesame street big bird get vaccinated talk friends show it. Antibody testing would good place start. CDC stated covid low risk reinfection 6 months post-infection.

I mistaken info post-infection vaccination, however. receive monoclonal treatment, vaxxed soon meet criteria ending isolation. ""People fear understand."" Wise words Syndra Dark Sovereign.   thread getting brigaded antivaxxers bots apparently Anti vaxers veery rare managed especially expectations set. assume people still conscious incapacitated arrive.

USA (richest country world) have.  going nightmare see downside here. Somewhere country little boy named Brandon thinks everyone rooting parents don’t heart tell otherwise. could implication, so, apologize them, sounded like “dirty Mexicans coming spreading coronavirus”. 

Don’t quote this, believe one point state going mobile vax clinics go straight fields help vaccinate workers.  experience quite similar mine.

After second shot woke essentially bad hangover: splitting headache, muscle aches, joint aches, nausea, tiredness (surprisingly fever). Lasted whole day til went sleep night.

After booster dose: woke feeling pretty ok next day. hours later felt starting come amounted moderate hangover: tiredness, muscle aches, joint aches, mild headache. fever (again), nausea time. Took Tylenol hot shower started receding. Lower peak, shorter duration. felt tired time went bed. Israel learned herd immunity going happen, even vaccine.   mindfuck. throwing Thursday night Friday morning. husband came home work less hour diarrhea. weak tired assumed food poisoning.

Still, nearly 2 years mess, can't get random symptoms are. mean, big difference Vermont much vaccinated South.

No. Assholes. died COVID whether goes Anti-COVID preconceptions dobn't care. got yesterday, day tested positive! couple hours received positive test, called local hospital able receive Bamlanivimab. think would problems anyway -- feel terrible treatment -- imagine every little bit helps. High vacc areas also likely population get tested caution.

Lots breakthrough cases still really mild symptoms- you’ve gone year without getting sick all, stand out. one person get tested comes back positive, they’re likely let people they’ve around know. also much likely get tested even without symptoms all.

Nestle banking consumer accepting narrative placed them. know long misplaced responsibility, need change practices.

This bit hyperbolic no? vaccines quite effective preventing infections first place. too! little worried getting time wasn’t bad Three snow leopards Lincoln Children's Zoo Nebraska died complications Covid-19, zoo officials announced Last month, zoo said leopards Sumatran tigers tested positive showing symptoms consistent virus. animals treated steroids antibiotics prevent secondary infections, zoo said time. development vaccination surprise government. point school start surprise. autumn another corona wave coming surprise, twice! benefit \*to you\*, healthy, young adult, tiny, since already vaccinated, risk quite low. cost risk associated (half hour time, chance getting cold-like symptoms day two), clear whether benefits outweigh risks, there's good guidance (basically, guidance ... meh).

To reduce risk parents, booster side effects bother (I got none), I'd get booster now-ish. “cases” still relevant metric?

We era vaccine. It’s established vaccine doesn’t prevent infections greatly reduces severity, hospitalization death. 

The numbers matter are:

How many *severe* cases involving hospitalization occurring compared time last year?

How many deaths occurring compared time last year?

How many two categories *unvaccinated*?

Every stat “cases” fear porn point. 

We never going enter “zero” risk phase. need deal that. 

The vaccinated need get lives fucksake. recommending second shot J&amp; J recipients already 3rd shots mRNA recipents 6 months ago. source I'm sure there's newer ones.  I've feeling pretty confident area live. people wearing masks, seem many Covid deaths state (I live RI)

This part conversation  I’m Vermont. Got booster last week. lot people showing get one. could pick three vaccines regardless one before. Isn’t Russia still 40% fully vaccinated? That’s pretty dire.  nothing special German Christmas markets contradicts well studied science behind minimal outdoors COVID transmission  therefore longer new lockdown school closings. Instead, possible introduce distance requirements public spaces, wearing masks 3G companies events. Corona rapid tests free again. regulations initially apply March 19,  Sanity prevails legitimate concern, people cannot grasp dangerous Covid is, long term effects actual virus also unknown. 

I doctor prescribe medication long term studies done pretty new. asked incline could be, response was, “well tell long term effects taking medication heart attack 30s” 

Needless say took medication I'd personally pick Gottieb Tedros. Sure Gottieb speak tinted rose glass, least Gottieb knows convey people trusting vaccine. Tedros hand repeats thing again. among fully vaccinated? I'm pro vax come. guess would say I'm 'over it' well. 

I'll wear masks makes sense. I'll distance inconvenience. I'm going continue seeing family. I'm going avoid hobbies love (grappling), even dangerous. two years. think COVID going anywhere anytime soon. can't continue put life hold rest world give fuck. I'll best protect me, that's point.

Right 85.6 % 60+ people vaccinated 74.1 % 18-59 years old. number hardly lower October. 

So overall still good ratio vaccinated crowd regards ICU stays. recently started boosters. help, too. main problem still vaccinated all. defeatist, unhelpful view honestly it’s way live.

It seems unlikely caught Covid visitors. Also Nebraska certain reputation, Lincoln vaccinated city. However it’s also true almost nobody wears masks outdoors zoo.

[Statewide, driving surge include people 20s, least vaccinated among Vermont adults, well children ages 5 11, eligible get vaccinated, Dr. Mark Levine, Vermont's health commissioner, said recent case surge, Vermont may also ""victim success,"" Levine said Tuesday, pointing lack natural COVID-19 immunity among unvaccinated residents ""because kept virus low levels throughout entire pandemic."" Vermont one lowest levels nationwide people developed natural immunity virus, CDC data Last year. like, millions mink iirc infect serve. Yes, worry ε δ need δ+ way …

I simulated current situation let excel sheet display Delta-Death-December might call change anything. Yeah got one vaccinated. Partially recovered 15 days. 90% recovered 3 months. vaccinated may faster recovery process.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* open enrollment disappointed this. FDA doesn’t data FDA keeps going back Pfizer saying need data. June said would require least 4-6 months follow data(instead 2 months like teens adults). either late July early August (can’t remember exactly) asked Pfizer Moderna double size trials.

Neither makes sense safety standpoint criticized AAP members vaccine advisory panel. major adverse reactions seen within 2 months going 2000 kids 4000 kids still give large enough sample size see rare side effects (like myocarditis), you’d need tens-of-thousands that.

Recently Pfizer CEO said interview need “efficacy data” cause recent delay. Even though FDA agreed study using neutralizing antibody levels means assess effectiveness, “need” case numbers.   specified assume type2. almost certainly referring type 2 diabetes. type 1 it’s exceedingly frustrating see articles/headlines like this. back half article discusses diabetes rise among younger people makes clearer they’re discussing type 2, since median age type 1 (an essentially shit luck-of-the-draw genetic condition) around 15. 

i understand news outlets don’t make distinction type 1 type 2. personally think shouldn’t even classified “types” condition means denying people hospital care need, covid cases also regular care. means consciously killing people. 1.	Police won’t shoot outside regulations.
2.	I defend right police follow rules.
3.	I don’t understand big deal police disobedience.

That pretty much sum up? Again, per [NL 435 COVID patients ICU population 17 million 

As stated above, concern likely based trends could headed rather current status, also doesn’t contradict original point hospital capacity, cases, relevant metric monitor Yeah, that's worrying. lot people die can't get treatment time. get worse next year.  forgetting Portugal, Malta, Iceland Spain? mean someone really medically can't take able get it.  otherwise may cost money pay up. Simple. pay extra month rent mortgage payment year, shot sounds better. Blame people...

This work time!! swear, people always want fat!! Can't put Snickers bar go run? Seriously wrong idiots, fat pandemic come around wipe out. 

Not intruding habitats.

Not us government plan send masks every person scrapped purpose. 

No lockdowns paying people. 

Food deserts big agriculture lobbies.

Classify pizza sauce filled sugar veggie could feed kids support schools. 

No system actually lose weight sell people diet products.

Don't blame people system, blame system ignorant... whatever.

There much death avoidable yes blame people. worth, even complete citywide shutdown Melbourne Australia numbers stayed stagnant even slowly climbed. passed 80% fully vaxxed opened again, numbers aren’t going up, rather dropping slightly. hit 92.5% first vaxxed (12+), start immunising 5+ January likely.

So guess find soon enough heard immunity (likely end around 95%) agree. lot people work still calling unfair, policy tobacco use. know someone deathly allergic one ingredients said simple process get exemption doesn’t pay premium. 

I see problem it. I’m tired backfilling unvaccinated coworkers keep call sick quarantined. Something needed change. Yes, cases typically determine outcomes line 

But point “case” imprecise measurement whose underlying meaning *wide variability*, measurement (testing) severity, dependent population immunity

Too many headlines comments focus raw case numbers themselves, context &amp; extrapolation; 2.5% hospitalization rate/case low (US, example, nearly 3 times higher). It’s severe outcomes matter, cases relevant project future figures Well done! That's absolute ton work. tragic one smaller part population thinks virus dangerous need vaccination, rest think pandemic basically them, see reasons restrict themselves. 

In meantime, computed models deliver best-case scenarios 50,000 worst-case scenarios 200,000 deaths, twice number deaths far. collapse intensive care system nearly inevitable, spite Germany among highest number UCI beds per capita OECD countries.

And many politicians think possible separate vaccinated unvaccinated, well supported previous experiences at-risk groups put mildly. current idea partial restrictions unvaccinated people (2G rules) would solve issue, allowing general access example supermarkets public transport. 

And helps even less school closures turned something undesirable fundamental issue. So, extremely high incidence numbers age group 5 14 years, places 1000 per 100,000 inhabitants.

It anti-vaxxers, politicians general failed communicate reality situation return ""normality"" somewhat ham-fisted manner.

Here map incidence numbers district age groups, based official data Robert-Koch Institut include 5-11 year olds approved? speculation, would guess general (and warranted) distrust notoriously corrupt government authority Brazilians opposite whatever they're told, ie.: corrupt government says bad, therefore must good. dont quite remember exactly was, either ZDF tagesschau graphics week showing hospitals south east Germany postpone elective surgeries 50%. general thats already problem every federal state. previous waves know dramatically worsens outcomes e.g. cancer patients.
Heres video Prof. Kluge describing current situation dramatic patients lung-, cancer- cardio vascular diseases. ""Those surgeries wait year thats huge problem."" btw specially like last line spiegel again, seems sensible people fix everything – others either unwilling incapable. think hospital numbers deaths come from?

And really fine 200 deaths day + delays medical care others? 87 year old double jabbed Mom same. thinks strong immune system may may get booster. husband got booster thinks covid big deal dangerous cormobities. Guess he’s fat/obsese, diabetic, stroke, pacemaker. Abstract

Get head, hopsitals = fine, deaths = low. drones insufferable, blocking point.  thought best way get people vaccinated. Raise insurance. mean higher risk. way get people vaccinated without mandating it. It’s song dance us plague infected Melbournians allowed back state :)
QLD assume? Can’t WA, never gonna let us back in. comply, worry That's basically Pfizer booster trial measured. 96% lower double vaccinated first 2.5 months. See details There’s lot people work getting vaccinated don’t insurance premium going $100/month starting January 1st  never said bias sides. I'm talking outright lies. 

You've indoctrinated ""false equivalency"" Fox News virus. bunch fucking losers Ordinarily, would afraid get shot fast food worker drive thru mess order.  Wait… right job terms? That’s progressive.   realise vaccines here... Well we've done latter UK, that's sure nail asserting here--are suggesting kids spread alpha, proportionately less perhaps, mechanisms? *They* get sit consequences *their choices*. *I* suffer together even though I'm vaccinated? *That* would unfair. ""Officials Virginia say least 100 kids aged 5 11 administered third adult dose Covid-19 vaccine pharmacy. NBC News contributor Dr. Natalie Azar says concern ""volume liquid small"" ""unlikely kids actually got full pediatric dose."" anyways planned enforce 3G rule, would mean people need prove vaccinated (geimpgt), recovered (genesen), tested (getestet) within last 24h.

Problem is, current infection rate worse anticipated. mostly refuse wear mask crowded places public transportation. 

I say, a(social)-holes idiots. glad stay home hope refuse fined accordingly. still clear lockdown unvaccinated enforced constitutional standpoint. Gotttleib pandemic mistakes:

""Out missed opportunities US course pandemic, confusing messaging boosters biggest one. much easier convince someone already fully vaccinated get booster someone yet get single shot get first shot. fact clear, unified message eligibility right could delay endemic stage should."" No, get pick girl want sex with. voucher 30mins.  Works quite well Europe It’s part “no one tells do” mentality

They selfish stubborn less vaccines fact delta already spread like fire throughout population 3-4 months naturally slowing down, like replay happened India. Nope? actually 1/2 hour one women free. workplace also pay fine. 

You also sent many people checked goverment. dont check everyone time, thats Problem rule. Every two months idiot says “we’re almost there”. going delta wave would soon could move entirely. He’ll saying garbage year we’re starting another winter wave. true though? vaccinated people experiencing less symptoms getting tested? many famous accounts fully vaccinated households everyone got Covid (just happened amongst people White House). understand that’s anecdotal even Israel study said household spread extremely common even amongst fully vaccinated (the study used push boosters). Yes still lots lots fear even vaccine, least contracting COVID-19. Lol   - Vaccinated people far less likely become infected unvaccinated people. can’t spread don’t it. Five times less likely places. Dutch UK reports confirm.      addition really bad news Germany, here's also really bad news us US.

* Germany higher % fully vaccinated population US (67% vs 59%)
* Germany ""mini-wave"" starting late August US did, theirs' proportionally less severe
* big wave late 2020 happened 2-3 weeks earlier Germany US
* last weeks upswing biggest wave ever, 7-day average 37K, 50% higher previous high, far without sign flattening

Is US going look like week Thanksgiving? Yep. $14 2 tests America way expensive. free $1 people want get control. It’s amazing European countries selling dirt cheap free yet Americans pay $14-23 2.  Still waiting see someone methodically tell fuck would happen medically-sound, science-based manner. see ""dead 3 years crowd"" involves nanobots exist yet TNT Sunday afternoon movie DNA transformations.    Yeah, enough police enforce it. Hell, police can't even enforce 2G rules restaurants quarantine covid positive people.

This change anything. full lockdown happen 100% ICUs filled. Australia seeks map positions things.  No, stupid is. :(  Bingo. Sure. That’s vaccine for.  There’s cost benefit analysis everything. people think wearing mask costs benefits. finally need mandatory vaccination. majority populace sacrificed continues sacrifice much minority hellbent receiving vaccine.

I'm tired overworked healthcare staff, minimum wage workers getting shot enforcing mandates, delayed ""elective"" procedures, lockdowns, curfews, travel bans, movement restrictions whatever garbage absolute shitfest pandemic brought us. r/ShitAmericansSay dislike people put others harm's way unnecessarily. goes drunk drivers much people refuse covid vaccine.   unvaccinated told ""sorry""

How determine someone medical emergency vaccinated not? would like determined happen collapse jogging get run drunk driver?  Comparing non-contagious health issues contagious ones worthless comparison. It’s like saying opinions created equal. Spoiler alert: no, not. Great response. I’ll read children. occupying ICUs linked effective vaccine preventing serious medical problems. necessarily linked infectious vaccinated are. remember back vaccine existed similar debate whether asymptomatic spreaders. were.

The daughter feel fine mom kids TRIPLE vaccinated. Mass quittings especially ICU nurses cut ICU capacity around -20% compared last year. country somehow able handle 5000 ICU beds filled COVID patients previous peak, already 3000 stretching us out.

Let's say loud time: states power federal government. Yes close truth. detected positive test previous day Disneyland, result next day (when found out) locked park tested everyone letting go (33,000 people) people quarantined days. That's taking virus seriously looks like, joke that's happening west.  I’m sure point I've good conversation GP phobias texts reminding get vaxxed triggering me. sad thing I've recommended EMDR therapy phobia based trauma. available NHS, rejected individual funding can't privately afford claim disability mental health issues. I'd love vaccinated, fears around covid spreading medically vulnerable people still wear mask everywhere despite mandatory anymore try stay much possible. worry much lifeline (social interaction friends) cut can't vaccinated despite UK showing signs going direction. agree antivax crowd, they're people show kind compassion issues led believing conspiracy theories people kindly debunked since. Soon mention issues needles provax crowd usually berates personally attacks me. Hoarding vaccine paying money?

Sorry country can't get shit together..... America tons problems apparently much problems country....

- vaccinated American People celebrating ""end"" way early. winter hit unvaccinated hard.   I'm sorry hear stories like this. embarrassed us behaving, truly shameful. hope get need soon stay safe then. didnt research TDMA lasers power fiber networks, using peoples knowledge posting internet.

also, pneumonia bacterial, antibiotics work not. reason give antibiotics people common cold get you’re saying, don’t go read online unless it’s recognized third party scientific study. Also, I’ve bad experiences doctors advice before, don’t like blindly trust them. I’ve hospitalized week pneumonia, doctor assured didn’t pneumonia shouldn’t take medicine antibiotics. (Keep mind 4 years ago, corona) realize I’m probably wrong respect don’t want vaccinated yet, please understand it’s probably lot scarier others, since there’s possible (in rare cases even life threatening) risk me. Thank advice ""Federation Imbeciles"" ""pandemic feeble minded"". Der Spiegel messing around, lmao. love it. Cite source I'll gladly retract statement. number saw 30% reduction spread among vaccinated. Also, look dumb curse.  work practice? mean someone walk randomly asked show vaccine status? can't even go walk hang park vaccinated? seems abit extreme.

Why impose vaccine passports instead need vaccine say go large venues etc. mandate vaccines healthcare workers etc instead. efficient one would probably ""No gunning people color funsies. mean time!""  Could imagine happening America? Chinese patience see follows science playing safe. That's China past two years.

Winter coming again. Yes. Absolutely. 

The consequences unvaxxed people lockdown (in case). 

The consequences lockdown unvaxxed people agains ruling party still seen (in case). 

It’s glorious time consequences. 

/s Delta vaccine-resistant. Covid bad Russia quite time. Earlier calling covid cases “pneumonia” could report lower numbers. friend lives Krasnodar region (Black Sea) says put mask mandate enforced police. also requiring proof vaccination enter public places like supermarket. I’m glad finally something even it’s response hospitals morgues overwhelmed China labeled origin since day 1, country knew SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence time see exhaustive study evidence then, still seen now.

US, residency slots tied medicaid funding healthcare spending controversial issue, expansion necessary fund spots would likely never make house senate. Perhaps could revamp funding spots entirely, however, would likely run problems. you’re vaccinated relatively healthy 80 years old, you’re gonna die covid, you’re not. soon though, rising fast still, states got priority starting run people vaccinate (who eligible), ACT example crossed 100% eligible vaccinated, population risen since last census really like 98% going similarly NSW 94.5% eligible first dosed rising. 

We end like Spain/Portugal. fucking make vaccinations mandatory. can't let people choose get vaccinated strip basic freedoms don't. That's democracy rule law works *very* dangerous precedent. 90% deaths vaccinations took full effect. [You look recent take specialized nurse from?  literally available staff anywhere. Also Covid gives ton health issues many specialists involved treating one Covid patient. got called agent government got paid posting propaganda. people...  wait learn COVID’s side effects! Hmm, kind news seem match data. According big spike cases Germany deaths hospitalizations seem bad moment paper (e.g. hospital admissions per capita less half US UK).

What missing? guy I’ll agree, thing controls vaccines boosters.

We know masks example reduce transmission cases, sort ""it's good fixes everything"" attitude really stupid.  chart shows actually deaths influenza way 14 years old, news me. Shows little threat covid actually young healthy. Actually reinforces argument completely unnecessary young healthy individuals. Here's another video doctor discussing spike proteins impair DNA repair:  workers probably think countries want convinced vaccine safe age group...... I'm saying brutal regime like China enforce stringent enough measures almost stop disease spreading, can't fathom anyone would take word it. ""No guys, Xi says good everything says true Covid gone!"" Also many mouths feed, can't imagine could anything drastic enough stop delta without mass starvation would basically halt many forms food production.

We Aus entry program China test entrants (who go quarantine) hardly tested positive delta tens thousands tests. doubt China's figures unreliable controlled well. 1/3 Americans diabetes pre diabetes  cost risk associated (half hour time, chance getting cold-like symptoms day two)

Compared getting (even mild case of) covid, risk time spent mention something I'd even consider risk time wasted.  doesn’t help keeps wrongly predicting different dates Delta ending. share unvaccinated ICUs disproportionately higher comparing size population.

Still relatively low grand scale things. limiting circulation vaccinated get higher return. Again, deciding something mathematically make quite sense. Yyyup, 2 new Delta variants Canada. 6 feet plenty close Delta transmission. Perhaps original virus, Delta passed outdoors pretty easily 6 ft without masks isn’t enough distance.   headline sounds much stricter actual regulation.

The home may left important errands, go work recreation. Unvaccinated people allowed go walk hang park. allowed go bowling visit club. Well train them. Offer generous salary option paid finish nurse qualifications covid over, get people interested. perhaps year intensive training specifically covid ICU patients, prepare them. They'd expected deal specialized stuff that's quite unusual covid patients - there'd someone training experience always around hospital help that. I'm saying perfect solution, surely could help. share unvaccinated ICUs disproportionately higher comparing size population. absolutly makes sense try stop overclocking ICUs isolating them. gonna work measurements whole population follow again.  escalate hate? People choosing get vaccinated can’t access places infect others. U/LikeADemonsWhisper, posting everywhere karma? 

I'm tired too, end day one stand thing, matter tired get. Going walk run mental health valid reason go outside. many exceptions, like still allowed go church, visit family need etc. isnt contagious disease doesnt allow infringments constitutional freedoms.

That's decide right law. nothing prevents passing another law says that, given obesity epidemic (which is, way - law yet), given obese people proportionally much likely end strain healthcare system, need limit basic freedoms.

Technically, obesity contagious per se, also partly heritable, heavily influenced genetics upbringing - therefore makes sense limit freedoms current obese population order reduce likelihood future obese people ending hospital. 70% low vaccination rate, articles consistently saying calling that? vaccines protective assumed, simple that, especially comes transmission infection. arguing idiot mental capacity 5 year old. going change brainwashed mind, hopefully ends ventilator sooner later world put stupidity.   relativly speakihng transmission way lower makes sense first limit circulation part population highest

No, makes sense limiting circulation people clog health care system, vaccinated often majority. Honestly, would bad thing, it. TWiV duo reviews SARS-CoV-2 attacks olfactory mucosa spares olfactory bulb, vaccination BNT162b2 induces virus-specific stem cell memory cells, development oral protease inhibitor treatment COVID-19.   guess US isn’t bad all. Thank Pfizer, Moderna Operation Warp Speed! Oh? one suffered first shot. 24 hours fever, joint pain, headache. 

The second shot fine. Perhaps little fatigue. 

Well, I'm waiting arms feel little less sore, I'm going back MMR, maybe something else, like Tdap. Gottah get vaccines free available. (Plus, get $20 free groceries.) Imagine thinking choices don’t impact liberty individuals.

That's why. compare us Canada certain states USA, night day.  think counties still reporting *something* defince governor's orders, huge drop worldometer around early October went effect. majority populace sacrificed continues sacrifice much minority hellbent receiving vaccine.

Exactly. way forward EVERYONE sacrifice insist making wrong choice.

How justifiable vaccine mandate?  work want put millions unvaccinated people jail? sure going stop virus Big Bird. understand, social circle we're al vaccinate know trust other, thing is, certificates available way, can't see trusting it, how, buy time, easy hack guess read OP's post mom dad traveling nonstop since left college--they've many airports public spaces knows fact they're asking precautions mega-vaxxed family thanksgiving annoys considering they've done Pretty trivial enforce willing actual penalties.

If found violating law, start putting people prison 30 days, pretty soon people going comply.

But needs actual penalties serve deterrence. I’m fully vaccinated massively restricting people health choices. coworker like, ""If die, die"". think they'll die instantly something? suffer days weeks. gonna make humble. Also effects weak lungs crap immune system. almost 3 weeks.  partisan certain side decided act like idiots purpose.

""is partisan"" actively made choice make things worse. Things partisan America:

Covid vaccines, ice cream, shoes, fried chicken, pillows. add flu vaccines list.

I can't wait see come next. Germans known fucking around explain? looked like opposite me? proper preparation, forethought planning, even easiest task made impossible.  Well, vaccination rate least vaccinated state doubled last 2 weeks, so... think exactly supposed to: make people get vaccinated. Sadly, ""austrian"" people bothered something inconvenience outweighs necessary expenditures. unvacicnated population have, never question principles, ""I can't arsed go get vaccinated good enough reason to"" - do. sure people want vaccine see conspiracy guys socialized mental health services saying florida stopped reporting numbers? kinda strange worldometer nyt still posting new florida numbers every day  Exactly right! Well that's something. exceptionally creepy able trust medical professionals treating hospital here's gottlieb study way. one cited bunch articles.

they ""prove"" vaccinated people tested infections minor either way.

edit: note aformentioned study say OP claimed Wait til Jan That, insurance often doesnt cover mental health well afford insurance 🙃 can't compromise. Society cannot function normally many unvaccinated living life normal. australia coded enter venues. also attached passports. seems like usa developed country trying stop spread Yeah, (and also lot stuff dare say) makes total idiot.

NY reference. tax euros going pay treat people refuse get inexpensive shot narcissistic morons instead going potentially save life narcissistic moron occupying valuable medical resources? Sorry no. Fuck that. I'd prefer opt paying tax entirely take chances going be. dumber US system.  Yes former, is. there's nothing subtle there, plain bigotry ignorance faces everyday What's alternative? Shutdown everyone? That's worse!  Lol, idk care got numbers stopped reporting October. idea real right numbers are, would bet wrong. Nothing changed since September stopped, hard imagine numbers drastically reduced then.  numbers flawed can’t prove vaccinated individuals getting tested infection minor. 


I don’t handy study promote boosters. Scott Gotlieb also mentioned lot.    real life numbers posted daily NYT covid page. look post delta dates want see whatever date range want.

i would curious though know isreal study referring read   I'm vaccinated (second shot May). I've cautious Coronavirus since beginning. parents hosting Thanksgiving next week, 10-15 total people expected go. that, mom's side family unvaccinated (her sister children 28 22 years old). mom's father virus March 2020 also unvaccinated (claims doctor telling get it).

&amp;#x200B;

I want go dinner. I've cautious everything almost two years now. fact many people unvaccinated going makes extremely scared going. I'm person seems feel way. line skipping dinner reasons? tells HCQ work What's hard understand unvaccinated responsible virus circulation, especially highly vaccinated populations.

But unvaccinated *are* responsible majority virus circulation, wide margin: bit graph labeled ""7-Tage-Inzidenz nach Altersgruppe und Impfstatus"". former one. Polling showed recently 94% vaccine uptake hospital workers. Nursing homes much worse uptake often national average levels. mandates via OSHA ETS novel.

but OSHA applicable workers smaller subset 100% population? mean pedantic, government could mandated everyone get shot religious exemptions would passed supreme court (unless somehow conservative court disregarded precedents...oh, yeah...nevermind) Well, that's gonna bring upvotes. forgot ""armed"". Link? studies pre delta delta. Also Israel study showed transmission household common even everyone fully vaccinated. implies close contact cause spread even fully vaccinated. feels like one wants remember that. Christians? Pope said go get vaccinated; higher authority earth have? 

r/s; know Protestants accept Pope’s authority, making point here…  Maybe start putting anti vaxxers prison mom immuno-compromised, even triple vaccinated still high risk.

The daughter sounds like immature, spoiled brat give shit mom. 

I bet parents paying college experience well. Mass quiting burn nurses anti vaccine? problem Germany like US? family gatherings many people packed inside like restaurants/clubs/gyms do. *turns PA, puts comment 'loop'* antivaxxers live year country authoritan regime.  Yes, forgotten noticed florida numbers still 100 per day. wild slow data rolled I'm crazy anti vax sounds like load freedom reducing bullshit me. I'm sure anti vax people going feel 10x uncomfortable it. booster ass. glad got phew 2 days agony that's FL, i'd curious currently 1,200 cases 100 deaths per day. that's insane 8/8 b8 m8 so, wear mask.  time. reason shut society save whiners.   proven vaccines aren’t effective limiting spread (they may limit window spread, that’s still researched). 

i'm sure people saying real life numbers show vaccine 6x effective stopping transmission anti vaxxers claiming it’s global conspiracy suppress freedoms

lol okay. ""freedom"" spread disease among fellow citizens. always devolves paranoid delusion government freedom 🙄  work.

but besides harm good. CDC even released app. 16,300 cases per day population 17.5 million equivalent 20,000 day florida 330,000 cases US population. 

that's pretty bad right. 

""We heading straight healthcare disaster whole system becoming jammed,"" five hospitals Limburg said letter Rutte's government. ""We're convinced rest Netherlands following us shortly.""

also, 85% fully vaccinated. that's adult number. akin top tier US state vaccination rates. Going laws past lockdowns (the new one published yet), driving somewhere car perfectly fine lots reasons. outside physical mental recreation one those. basically admit intending break rules get fined. seriosuly! really trying spread misinfo?

No, incidence numbers younger people numbers older people connected. numbers are, speak, incidence many thousands among children younger vaccinated people would still extremely hospitalizations among them. 

In fact, average age people ICUs falling. doesnt really seeing slight decrease 24-48 hour timespan. would like thinking number unvaccinated teenagers catching dropping drastically, data also shows period. Thats also unlikely true. get tattoo code. Doubt it! 2022 2021 was. Daily positivity reminder- Infection curves Europe seem peaking. Hardly year back countries strict lockdowns. winter European countries resisted lockdowns till vaccinated except Netherlands East EU countries (where situation real bad). Lockdowns thing past.

2022 better. Hopefully early summer 2022 end mask mandates. sure surprising. We've heading path politicizing anything everything long while. Everyone responsible emphasis always dividing ourselves. theory? months Estonia lol It’s also around six months vaccines opened general population, people get boosters. ""miles"" describe lot different distances anyway. problem that's briefly entered mind times. Could politicization COVID-19 vaccines lead politicization vaccines? Unfortunately, looks like that's yes. need prepare world vaccines met skepticism educating people scientific reasoning, even practically implementing difficult. happening shadow growing political polarization sagging trust institutions, even difficult problems mitigate. California happy it! intended carried around. Vaccine passports touchy subject stateside lol, even podunk little Canadian province 1.4m incompetent government years released functional vax card app back June. many rounds “I took hand fire burning - isn’t, put hand back fire” going go catch on? Hey least natural immunity would kick in.  Washington system 😊 it’s great  agree-But hold tight. 2021 vastly better 2020.

2022 even better Same, mine pre-Covid times. took good month recover, lingered months. usually mind matter thing, flu. Couldn’t imagine foreign country, travel home! They’re stubborn wanting prove points Covid vaccine they’ll refuse vaccine available point help make case. Props Austria. Keep unvaxxed home. It’s lot like drunk driving, danger others. Meanwhile, don’t think so. deterred similarly, random checkpoints. caught consequences also like drunk driving, fines court ordered classes public health. meaningful metric post-mass vaccination. Portugal single digit deaths average/day since March. vaccinated country EU clearly shows de coupling cases deaths(hospitalizations well) Governments say time sorts things nobody complains about, often already include vaccines. Fair something children care you’re supposed grown realize live world people never asked born. agree living life. It’s annoying wear mask everywhere go green pass scanned. Train, metro, bus, grocery store, work, etc etc. feels like there’s clear messaging. state CA QR code vaccinated people I’ve yet see used anywhere it’s frustrating would much easier deny nonvaxxed people events, bars, etc. Yes. horrible polls. diseases placed restrictions: access public schooling (and often colleges) without vaccination. reason adult restrictions significant percent vaccinated children. precedent existed 50 years, isn’t new.

Building level infrastructure required support unvaxxed population would far expensive. vaccinated responsible unvaccinated choice get free, safe vaccine?

The reason even discussion became politicized. Prior pandemic uptake childhood vaccines quite high, ones abstained spread across political spectrum places represented tiny minority. could imagine people getting covid vaccine flu vaccine use would go up. democrats usage go up, republican use go down, both? problem cases currently growing 42% week

Did take account increased testing, got 42% grow? dont want flew, maybe stay ground Massive antivax Karens here. Worked even better Portugal. bit, everyone got vaccinated, need anymore. Um, old man farts, better farting around Democrats Republicans? Asking friend...   anyone know find efficacy findings booster symptomatic infection? finding efficacy hospitalizations death. Thanks. basically is. used ""passport"" allowed go restaurants vaccinated, recovered, tested negative. vaccinated. sure planet vaccination status australia phone. 

Either Medicare app via web browser Medicare downloadable certificate.  Local mandates city/health care workers survive court challenges. However national mandates likely blocked. 1905 SCOTUS ruled states/local municipality mandate appears stick with. leaves million workers private companies mandate. Austria here. ""lockdown"" means can't go bowling, cinema restaurant. still gather to24 people ( 25 limit). still go shopping groceries go walk. ""you can't fun stuff, pls stay home get fucking finally vaxed"". Even fully vaxed get tested watching movie going late night restaurant club.  going think know better folks hospital, GO???????? 

They want bring everyone down. Daily new infections europe european union maximum since last november Many european countries imposing lockdowns unvaccinated, austria today experts europe warn current measures enough. fact they're saying everybody needs reduce contacts 2G+3G, boostering vaccines enough wont stop current wave. positivity People fully vaccinated COVID allowed leave homes specific purposes, like going doctor, getting groceries, going work — getting Germany must ""everything necessary"" break fourth coronavirus wave, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday. [,,,] Spahn Wieler spoke coronavirus cases Germany surged record twice many new cases: Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, new cases: Albania, Andorra, Belgium, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Luxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Portugal, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands Saturday became first western European country since summer impose partial lockdown, Berlin bars restaurants unvaccinated, France races improve booster campaign, Europe centre around 12 Minute mark

Aktuelle Corona-Lage mit Jens Spahn (CDU) &amp; Lothar Wieler (RKI) | BPK 12. November 2021

Prof. Dr. Wieler, head ""Yesterday first time ever 50.000 infections single day. 50.000 cases 3.000 need see hospitalisation. 50.000 cases least 350 need admitted ICU. 50.000 people least 200 die. [...] important make realize numbers mean. result single day 50.000 cases. clear incidence rise further. hard weeks months ahead us. [...] disarm dangerous developement everyone needs change behaviour. Reduce contacts. Wear masks. [...] 2G enough anymore. [...] Bars clubs considered closed. Everyone get tested, even vaccinated meeting risk groups. publicized recommendations since September, need taken action Sounds like things sort out, eventually... conservatives anti-flu shots now, I'm getting flu shot. :P Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* incorrect. basically lockdown rules normally everyone subjected to, refuse vaccinate. hate say it, rules might actually help much. saying attempted, closer hygiene theater point actual mitigation. Why? Two things. main reason reacting, already late, learned (or maybe haven't?) throughout pandemic. take action *before* infection blitz gets going. started, late, able stop it, even somehow slow down. Second reason: whole lot spread happens households, mostly beyond reach public health measures legally practically. people going spread home private settings, there's basically nothing it. try lay rules, again, that's little, late, like throwing sandbags there's already raging flood.

The reason virus successful many people hate resist things know need done stop spreading. Totally understandable, heavy price pay. we're left ugly Hobson's choice. would say divide science religion, rather partisan.  flu shots? Damn It’s silly Norm MacDonald comment. Apologies ✌🏻😄 needs O2 anyways, right?

/s looking actual restrictions put place.  ""experts"" lol. Talking arse. Yeah like, ""don't force get free vaccine, choose get pay prove I'm health risk workplace"" people dying usually 50, uk 95 percent 50s vaxxed least 1 jab, germany isnt close that. Uk also removed retrictions ago 50s vaxxed natural immunity level also significantly higher contradicted Fuck lot dumb republicans days. 

You know many democrats refused get vaccine developed trump administration….none….  Government force. forced millions things every day. Including licence registration tolls seatbelt drive. Yet little needle bothers you. Ok bro. pretty terrible zoo. feel bad animals there. here! Went 27 BMI 22. feel incredible get all. going think know better folks hospital, GO???????? stay home rub essential oils feet whatever dumbass idea have. vote people don’t trust?

That ‘distrust’ gone way beyond ‘healthy’.  funny opposite side sees left thing whether true. Politics toxic. cares idiots think really sucks doesn’t Cosplay wankers   Yet keep voting corrupt assholes  making people wear mask 30 seconds door table, 30 seconds table bathroom, eat &amp; drink &amp; shout &amp; laugh mask-free table 2 hours they're restaurant??? shit reduce spread. 1-3% left crying religious exemptions even though they've already received around 17 (mandatory) inoculations

It easy process soldier requests religious exemption. look service records they’ve already received mandatory vaccines years: Denied. think would better payback broad testing mandates, especially using rapid antigen tests, along lines UK -- handing packs home test kits like halloween candy. 

The US FDA authorized many tests clear why.    nobody ""over it"" comes airport screenings... way life now.

speak  Good CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate 8%. you’ve fully resume activities prior reduce risk infected Delta variant possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission. areas high substantial incidence memo, however, federally mobilized, members must vaccinated.

The problem idea takes 5 weeks minimum become “fully vaccinated”. That’s hardly would call nimble suddenly needed. Good question highlights difference DNA virus (like herpes simplex - exactly said, active latent periods body, never goes away) versus RNA virus (such SARS-COV-2) eventually get eliminated. 

It actually biggest challenge developing mRNA vaccine - immune system really good eliminating foreign RNA. It’s need booster shots - vaccine works, immune system also works it’s it’s normal thing get rid something thinks invader. 

With said, mRNA vaccine tested possible release 2022 active phase HSV. won’t clear dormant HSV neurons protect active outbreak, functionally cure. 

For something like diabetes caused SARS-COV-2 you’d need reverse damage pancreatic cells caused infection. Adverse facts filled outrage describes certain flavor (R)adio decades now. Yeah, seems case. asked one answer. lazy health. Germans want us believe. asked explain something clearly flagged assumption. so.

Your reaction disagree cant tell a) actual difference risk infection vaccinated b) youre getting figure from.

You obviously dont know giving gut reaction only. Thats fine shouldnt pretend otherwise. Flag clearly did. honest. believe kind things related leadership good transparent communication. several crucial failures Germany. 

I think also complacency lack critical thinking, replaced wishful thinking esoteric myths. People joking that, need come terms make future survival evidently harder.

Apart that, exist targeted disinformation campains actors interested destabilizing democracy - similar happened political campains US UK. hope change minds speak them. Increasing risk dying angry government stupid. Yes, government's prediction wrong, partly fault. sure hoping people get vaccinated Delta exist first.

Also lot people, especially older ones, already getting flu shot year. booster Covid twice year, too, vastly reduce chance dying? Yes, unfortunate vaccines seem 100 % effective forever, especially among older people bad immune system, already two doses vaccine past without big side effects, really reason afraid 3rd, 4th 5th shot. Yes, US whole. parts climates like northern Europe. going fly unless operator ""converted"" new religion since joining receiving 20 something vaccinations  Whats going Australia? Facial recognition, protest, etc pretty draconian there. shot guys, big deal. Literally known decades 🤣"
