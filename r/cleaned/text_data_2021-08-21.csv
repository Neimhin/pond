Media influence seem play part Lydia Rodriguez appeared afraid vaccines general. popular here. chance gets elected. fine without booster. necessary people severe medical issues. good discussions boosters Week Virology podcast. think whole waning efficacy vaccines narrative seriously overblown research unclear whether boosters would good. 

One point made intent vaccines always prevent serious disease prevent infection, fact MRNA vaccines actually prevented infection makes remarkable. 

Are vaccinated people getting infected? Yes, rise cases also happened coincide lifting restrictions mandates. don’t give shit. feel like people 60 need rest population get vaccine. Everyone quoting hard science peaks would go away. Look comments days ago saying peaks, literally based nothing.  Check numbers -- breakthrough rate 2.6%, 39 11K: ""Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers RT-PCR data available, 39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections documented.""

Also, study Alpha, strain vaccine far effective preventing breakthroughs. also people wearing full PPE, presume. can't generalize 2.6% breakthrough rate study what's going US all.

Instead, focus 7 39 long covid, IIRC one 7 come back work 6 weeks. guess means patrons businesses go enforcing mask wearing. want it? Go business then. also say eat meat isn’t well done...   San Diego last 30 days document split vaccination  Embarrassed admit it, I'm one people waiting full approval.

One percent entire country population vaccinated yesterday. 

We reached ‘one million fully vaccinated mark’ 72% eligible population booked in. enough vaccine country. 

(Side note: Nearly amount tested.) Record numbers here.   oh ok, guess FDA decided take 6-7 years clinical trials. Something smells fishy. It’s never militaries job deploy civilian hospitals.

I really wish would stop sensationalizing 'breakthrough' cases. vaccines much working designed. Best place test vaccine effectiveness actually. study published July Israel shows roughly 19% breakthrough cases develop long-covid:

Unless hide bubble know probably taking precautions again. care point. mom 75 pro vaccine knows delta also wants go trips cruises willing take risk guess:/ That... anti-vax.

""Hey, vaccination greatly reduces risk, way zero, still exercise caution"" anti-vax.

Sad can’t rally again. Stay away fellow diner! vaccine may rub me. else got? Authorities seem uninterested tracking anything short hospitalisation vaccinated people - want know risk passing under-12's, getting long COVID. far: overseas prelim studies, spitballing ""well, ought lower risk"" guesstimates scientists and... anecdotes!

One thing done stewing anger people global community much higher impact variants them. I'm focused tracking global immunity now. people antivax relatives, turn around get vaccinated? so, why?  tip trip  expiration dates extended?

FDA’s guidance industry, “Changes Approved NDA ANDA” explains manufacturer approved drug product may extend expiration date drug product based testing acceptable data accordance protocol approved new drug application (NDA) abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) (see 21 CFR 314.70). help alleviate drug shortages, FDA also approved extensions expiration dates data supporting extension available. thats really claimed first place, not?  shame entirely ineffective ""Get COVID-Free"" cards. virus accept valid.

Hope mom feels better   huge part Afro-Americans low vaccination rate. Unlike average antivaxers good reason distrust. sad continues hurt long time after. sort feel bad Gen Z crowd, instead fighting power paid forward taking TikTok...   Also worried permanent damage. sorry loss father.  Yes. mind boggles even question.  mean besides fact pay anything humanitarian anything? Europe still paid us back WW2. protected western Europe never paid protections? us fitting portion bill vacinate world everyone else needs pitch well far...not much.   Natural Selection think part full authorization includes full inspection every production facility world wide make sure vaccines made quality standards.  That's got in, hotel quarantine breach someone managed isolation, bubble breach.  Provincetown outbreak showed Delta-driven breakthrough infections rare, quite common variant dominant. claim rarity based pre-Delta data put CDC alpha virus.

I think happened Delta surged damn fast people regularly follow updates pandemic stopped paying attention everything started opening thought trajectory back normalcy. like lot bad news going about, I'm seeing selective bias cognitive dissonance play, may explain false belief breakthrough infections rare remains pervasive. think Florida cares shoots chest? like trying pin one hurricane climate change. hard do. Keep mind vast majority cases pre-vaccine asymptomatic mild begin with.  think places, law actually let things day turn 18. 17 year 363 day old cannot. lawyer, read textbook once. Yes.

Got cards, immunological deficient people qualify based honor system. Surprised Kawhi Leonard face 😐 Yeah delta way worse covid classic Yes, Ontario masks mandatory indoors since last summer.  claimed reduce chances infection transmission, claims based ancestral strains much lower viral load. Delta 1000 times making infectious chickepox (so CDC says). That's crazy!! Good you! 

Here Canada everything recorded health cards there's way get extra doses unless offered government. Think estimates put pfizer 70-80% effective preventing infection. infected spread it.... research sewage surveillance polio. Glad see done COVID. can't tell do! mom! That’s pretty irresponsible you.

It practical type data look figure 2, shows results. example, people hospitalized ventilators scored -0.5 standard deviations. scored around 20% less control. [This suggests Delta twice likely cause hospitalization death. spread easily, hits significantly harder. vaccinated close relations vaccinated, fine. young kids, they'll also fine, they're much risk point. mean limo driver states wearing PPE vaccinated due family history blood clots? lime driver sat near coughing patrons cafe days testing positive? media jumped bloke hard Nurses number 1 export. fist time? :scared: people w health conditions( blood disorders) , fucked clog hospitals, spots needed people really need. want drink bleach / chloroquin / horse dewormer go hospital regardless happens next ? guest.

Sometimes I’m grateful I’m age I’m really missing anything big this. Seeing students miss prom graduation sucked. Seeing parents stuck home first years retirement sucked. 

Like yeah, missed trip two, otherwise nothing. It’s mentality North American can’t relate to. I’m thankful live jurisdiction vast majority citizens vaccinated restrictions place, despite us 500 cases per day province 5 million.

Australia’s hyper-reliance lockdowns botching vaccinations something every Aussie pissed about. That’s incorrect. It’s literally 2 initial blast. 29 firefighters died due radiation exposure within next months. us covid January, I'd probably inject anything feel like ever again. Okay..not really...but quite bit anecdotal evidence people's symptoms alleviated received mrna vaccines. 

We hoping. say?  Devil’s advocate - asymptomatic mild case statistics inaccurate. 

We testing enough get clear picture regions outbreaks (see high positivity rates - means many missed cases). 

On top that, systemic bias re: likelihood getting tested vaccinated vs unvaccinated. (This could go either way - stopped testing frequently vaccinated, still probably test frequently many people irresponsible vaccinating.)

The right way population survey - random testing population. 

Reporting raw case numbers people choose tested somewhere recorded give accurate picture. Choosing unvaccinated means ok spreading mutating deadly virus, potentially killing others. Many people want date killers. April/May 2020, I’d say took June/July year pretty much 99%. Never want again. antibodies generated current vaccine highly effective delta. takes them. 3rd dose gives secondary immune response much greater rise antibody level second dose given close first one. Data Israel shows age population received boosters much greater vaccine effectiveness age&lt;60 cohorts. Also age 12-15 recently vaccinated 2 doses 90% vaccine effectiveness infection, similar found early pre-delta studies, antibody levels time drop. Ok, thanks, wondering.  Oddly enough last night saw commercial Washington State showing two Catholic priests encouraging people get vaccinated, saying religion science compatible.

* Republicans take control House 2022
* Republicans elect Trump Speaker House puts line succession President (incidentally, Speaker House *does not* member House Representatives)

Lol, country mass appointments based cities last 1-3 days assigned letter last name expected present given time, waiting open summer days    Bruh   understood correctly federal government never aimed 0 cases. states set goal (and reached it)  bet politics - we've seen politicized pandemic gotten, can't coincidence surges anti-public-health states.

But! may simple. little poking around curiosity, looks like current COVID vaccination rates across states actually less track flu vaccination rates years leading pandemic, several states (including states surges, like Texas Florida actually much *more* vaccinated COVID flu typical season.

Flu vaccines state: 
COVID vaccines state: wondered maybe people take flu shot seriously. something *really* dangerous like tetanus?

It's kind deal. 60% people get tetanus shot, according study: may big slice population afraid needles something. 🤷‍♀️ drank bleach, probably confused parts intestine pooping worms. Send digg.com.  :) seriously sounds like Trump talking bleach. Hope people start drinking providone-iodine. Correct -- 8 new cases total number cases. article suggested Melbourne locked found eight new cases total number cases. I'd say based symptoms minor vaccine extremely effective. know site dataset shows per capita vaccinations rates? Would interesting see differences are.  Great I’ll let elderly parents know, cruise ship docks Belize tomorrow… vaccine longer extremely effective current variants

You mean variant. Furthermore, fact we're seeing breakthrough cases blessing. teacher mom, I'd say pretty high. kids' school made masks mandatory. look forward booster shot. chances good I'm going okay, I'm fully vaccinated. anecdotal cases long COVID vaccination, certainly far fewer unvaccinated. It’s law large numbers. vaccines prevent, say, 99% deaths among vaccinated, course see deaths vaccinate 175 million people +. reading newsworthy. got keep mitigation measures need instead away get tired them

Half mitigation methods people live with. Individual vaccines Delta panacea, high rates fresh vaccinations might be. Wild. Imagine healthcare ""TOO accessible""! Sorry- disappointed Canadian.

I going reply tomorrow something along lines - treatment methods Covid would likely expected disbursed doctors treating individual people covid. *(She mentioned things like taking cough medicine, changing position every two hours avoid lung build up. idea medical recommendations facebook recommendations)* already gone over, multiple times, differences risk actual covid versus vaccine side effects. sent statistics regarding hospitalization rates, mid thirties hospitalization risk certainly less 1%. better believe hospitalized she'd want newest, current treatments. said wants five year study vaccine's long term effects. good news is, make science based decision, scientist. job determine effective medical scientific actions are.

But, comment matter, actually fairly impressed masking. actually actively enforce think least people wear properly. I've seen one mesh mask far. Now, people take good number stick nose out, I've also seen getting yelled whenever staff member sees it. people take outside, good keep even then. Seems better enforced high school NC iirc least. 

As distancing, think required, classrooms crazy tight least. distanced (at least full space), packed like sardines thankfully. nice thing dorms suite style get bit space too. 

Now, like covid spread something I'm concerned about, I'm hoping bad. Better lot places I've seen. They're also giving free vaccines everyone (even non students). also classes recorded, (realistically when) need lock down, plans keep *too* chaotic. It'll still frustrating, hopefully bad. 

Basically precautions, good things like fairly good job enforcing masks. seem decently top things, gives little hope. still worried, that's least (probably optimistic) perspective. NEW ZEALAND CONCEDED ambitious “Covid zero” elimination strategy may longer viable today outbreak virulent Delta variant spread further.

Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins reported 21 cases virus cluster emerged Auckland last week, ending six-month run local cases sparking national lockdown.

Hipkins said Delta’s highly transmissible nature making outbreak difficult contain others, raising “big questions” elimination strategy.

“The scale infectiousness speed virus spread something that, despite best preparations world, put system strain,” told TVNZ.

New Zealand’s widely praised Covid-19 response – resulted 26 deaths population five million – centres eliminating virus community.

It relied strict border controls backed hard lockdowns cases slip through, Hipkins said Delta may force rethink.

“(Delta’s) like nothing we’ve dealt pandemic,” said. change everything, means existing preparations begin look less adequate raises pretty big questions future long-term plans.""

Neighbouring Australia also pursued “Covid zero” strategy similarly frustrated Delta cases continue spike.

The New Zealand outbreak underlined country’s slow vaccination rollout prompted accusations government became lax early success dealing pandemic.

Only 20% population fully inoculated, one lowest rates developed world.

Opposition National Party spokesman Chris Bishop said outbreak exposed lack urgency Wellington’s vaccine plans.

“The government’s complacency inability ensure supply delivery vaccine made us sitting ducks, completely vulnerable Delta variant inevitably got community,” said.

Another opposition figure, ACT Party leader David Seymour, said Hipkins could use Delta variant excuse current failures.

“We’ve known Delta since December, what’s meantime?” asked.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Such as? Masks thankfully never politicised NZ since we've never worn now. Every place I've public since order went 100% compliance.   honestly feels like past 18 months, people convinced prevent ever getting sick dying. Louisiana's case, assuming vast majority deaths 65+, 16% unvaxxed made 80% deaths. math correct, means vaxxed/unvaxxed populations equal, unvaxxed would make 95% deaths, line know vaccine effectiveness. going away, certainly taking 200,000 daily cases like predicted. Sus?!? sense, pure ~~contrariness~~ neuroticism.

FTFY Great, gains approval people already Delta seems large transmissibility advantage let Lambda gain foothold.   give antibodies?  Parts Africa 0.1% vaccination rates already taking care that. Kentuckian transplanted Florida here.

""Absent clear public health messaging, vaccinated people left confused protect themselves. "" 
How about.... try stay away crowds, wear masks indoors, keep indoor spaces well ventilated. I’m confused. someone explain would need booster evidence waning immunity now? fully vaccinated reluctant get third dose. shhhh can't say here, upsets midwits. NZ interesting bubble, mostly going lives like virus long time now, everything strategy hinged never letting COVID in.  

The fox loose henhouse really low vaccination numbers. Good luck NZ. would implement new restrictions? already harshest restrictions North America place. much could minus lockdown. journalistic articles, reporting situation France. comedic pieces. happen source confirming supermarkets stores included making stuff? 200 total hospitalizations, daily admissions lol.

That's sister (a medical doctor) told least, ones family large face. Hope using opportunity bank money treat yoself right moment! expected. frankly miracle least something fast. Covid vaccines increasing chance. Vaccines make 100% immune. suffer less unvaccinated people.

Reality is, live Covid time. Maybe forever (like flu). Covid mutate less danger, better medications vaccines. least booster shots vulnerable. Fun fact: also bring lost ones back. comfortable fact even goal vaccination rates, thousands likely die COVID open back up? get sense Aussies really wrapped heads around reality. Thanks comment, puts things back context Read good article [Simpson based Israeli covid data. 

Starts Israeli government figure 60% Covid hospitalisations Israel vaccinated people. Sounds bad. Simpson Paradox factored in. 

The essence Israel, 90.4% 50's vaccinated. looks like vaccinated people hospital (60% Covid hospitalisations vaccinated people) reality 90% people received vaccine 50's. skewing data. 

A simpler breakdown Simpson Paradox seen is:

Take 100 people

90 vaccinated 10 vaccinated.

Say 15 vaccinated people 8 non-vaccinated people end hospital covid. 

More vaccinated people ended hospital. 90 people 100 guys vaccinated begin pool people larger. 

When broken % is:

80% unvaccinated needed hospital

17% vaccinated needed hospital.  Uhhh think misunderstanding promised vs seeing delta. Pretty sure joint(and teeth, wtf?!?!) pain days symptoms themselves. long haul stuff exhaustion along lesser version mindfog would come &amp; go. One knees problematic &amp; overuse right arm due stroke years ago still limits left arm's function could well overlooked normal. study May Alpha variant UK showed vaccines reduce chance ~~severe symptoms~~ *death* ~2/3 manage contract it: [The data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher – around 69% – confirmed cases second dose least 7 days prior positive 
Later, data showed [spreading second vaccination apart even 3 like Israel US causes much stronger antibody response. UK (and Canada) spread vaccination doses start, fair say trials going show stronger vaccine effectiveness least points US. 
And, data shows time antibodies vaccine wane, study 2 months ago, antibodies waned least since. 
And finally let's throw fact everyone vaccinated 2-doses Pfizer Moderna. 1/5 ""vaccinated"" Americans 1-dose, almost garbage Delta 33% effectiveness. J&amp;J also effective Delta mile. 
 
All compounding factors means US certainly 69% reduction severe disease. Probably around 55-60%. think stretch call ""~half"".  President answerable American voters.  
Haven't seen credible polling this. need 55%+ voters show inclination this. Unless clear polling this, reason this. Hahahaha sounds like game telephone

Was surrounded protesters yesterday needed get tested. selfish misinformed

Just couple things, lockdown lock bear mace automatic weapons used pharmacies don’t collaborate data. So, went CVS main vaccines, could sign Walgreens. CDC gives vaccine full approval (I think read Monday Friday), could probably ask doctor script recommendation booster use openly. docs would probably recommend earlier booster parents even minor health risks, especially antibody test shows lower levels expected.

The life knew likely over. Things different now. sucks that’s life. 

If think bad, really bad news re: climate change. plaintiffs die covid  lot hand waving misinformation goes unchallenged

If one actively avoids plethora places misinformation challenged, sure. gross thing ask someone lost someone knew. Immediately asking tragedy killed specifically…  mean “liability?” very, tiny number people advised get it, mainly life threatening allergy ingredient. person would likely know ahead time, would reacted things.  Oklahoma here. don’t statistics vax non vax. head dept health provided statistic: unvaccinated person come vent alive since July.   mean already cave man, getting covid makes smart two cave men? Exactly. didn’t want undermine confidence vaccine. people knew could still catch Covid vaccinated, wouldn’t bothered get it. 

They assumed changing restrictions making vaccines look like cure would motivate people get vaccinated. That’s local governments unfortunately. Last heard Florida wasn’t releasing vaccine status infections. No. waste time. might even doctor patient. could insurance issue. Netherlands almost new cases last two months Delta. 80% population Florida, 40 deaths per week. “Maybe people drink little bleach try inject sunshine, dunno could helpful” - man president giving advice nationally televised press conference

I thought sinus infection tested (fully vaccinated) friends tested positive. case, wife son also used home rapid tests - husband already positive, again, reason go get formal test. husband horrible headaches last week lingering cough - he’s testing negative rapid tests think it’s he’s already it.

All say, vaccinated cases almost definitely grossly underreported. vaccinated, correct? breakthrough infections terrifying. speak myself, felt like battle got done second vaccine. kind thought COVID would reduced seasonal respiratory virus. guess wrong. would patient considered liability? sad goes show antivax people truly understand vaccines work agree, they're going closed rest world forever want keep delta country. going get point living we're vaccinated. friend works rural county's government. already kind since J&amp;J initially got approved. worked health department reach people isolated parts county send nurses people might otherwise get vaccine.

Maybe dumb (maybe) never even thought this. Would doctor actually claim liability reasons? And, given area from, makes sense people sue anything. I'd shocked person got sick filed suit he/she denied vaccination liability reasons. 

This serious. Meanwhile 3500 people died COVID Florida last 30 days. also unknown factor would sku stats known - undoubtedly breakthrough cases among vaccinated people going unreported asymptomatic.

Most vaccinated people feel fine getting tested ""just because."" recommended human dose 12mg, much idiots taking ? Yes, agreed. anecdotes hearing weeks super concerning hard data tell us valid are.  physician would laugh someone attempting sue getting covid vaccine. lawyers would laugh harder.   Maybe wants UV &amp; bleach treatment?

🤔 lost interest eating things? say smell important... it? 

What things taste? might kind good hate taste smell anything green Okay using UK stats posted government. 241 people died 5th October 2020 covid complications, day alone around 10000 people tested positive. That's 2.41% group dying. 99.9% survival rate right? that's rushed maths even taking time consider factors, like people actually tested positive. solely comparing number deaths day number cases shocking low mortality rates, surprisingly total number deaths staggers behind total number cases. even so, may die get infected may cause next mutation massively spikes moratlity rate renders vaccines useless, protecting now, protecting others future. anecdote “my friend fully vaxxed got last week” isn’t overly helpful. 
Contrast “my entire social network 100 people indoor event, us fully vaxxed, 60 us sick.” 
Neither examples rolled formalized data analyzed level speed. 
By time happens, Delta dozens chances jump new hosts. 
So, watch consider reacting relevant anecdotal evidence waiting see larger studies. That’s silly.

Even secondary close contacts.

Entire schools parents get quaratined. How's meaningless? Today detailed data two type persons getting infected, vaccinated vaccinated, data shows 99% persons dying unvaccinated 

What dies data tells us? vaccine reduces chances ending hospital drastically also chances surviving extremely high

To unvaccinated choice reading this, ""let odds favor"" Friendly reminder [Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp double-edged sword. vaccine supply shifted largely unvaccinated countries, people vaccinated longer eight months already effectiveness waning (for Pfizer/Moderna) people contracting it. people get it, chance variants popping up. bad/bad situation can't vaccinate everyone once....which possible.

Because actually looking them, comprehending them, would lead absolutely inescapable conclusion lock again. Delta, even necessary back March 2020. know, long look directly thing, pretend exist. 

Even willing acknowledge numbers bad start going ""the public appetite another lockdown"" makes slightest bit difference terms must done. 

And yet, seems simply going it. explanation level, perhaps even unconsciously, collective decision made we're going absorb continuous, continuously escalating, losses, deaths, disability brought long COVID, collapse healthcare system's ability reliably provide care, whether one sick COVID something else. 

Some us, course, make side relatively unscathed, point could even hazard guess society look like then.

The US world. I'm vaccinated I'm still completely isolated everyone else, go anywhere wear N95 mask wash hands.

So no, us returning normal. We're going accept way life now, could certainly change future hope better. Murica. Bloodletting leeches fix right up. Oh, dewormer, seems. /s ??? What? living normally 0 cases since pandemic began. like country ever going ""beat it"" reply makes sense posted, two different things, replying you, yes, right, friend fully vaccinated, got exposed virus tested positive, said minor discomfort, couple days, nothing. stayed quarantine week, test again, came negative back regular life.

The vaccine proven reduce drastically chances ending hospital chances dying, even cases people vaccinated end dying explanations vaccine help.  keep trying tell people around me. Vaccines bubble force field. don’t deflect SARS-CoV-2 particles. prime body it’s best possible shape fight virus detected immune system. people, means pretty quick response without even knowing it. others, could flu-like symptoms. 

But everyone, fighting virus vaccine system puts pretty significant advantage mitigating severe illness March 2020. Nothing anything-“proof.”

But outdoors safer indoors, (as said) outdoor events happening long time little ado.

If fully vaccinated, going would relatively low risk, might wish bring quality mask crowded areas, depending risk tolerance. not. I've known woman 16 years(since 3rd Grade), unfortunately, know legitimate nurse. quite sad, disturbing.  sad countries like Peru west europeans tries correct issue (real death toll), others tries hide deaths situation giant gay orgy tons saliva swapped too. outbreak grocery store without mask lol Surely someone Harvard Yale diploma sits governors office quick simple free way prevent all, organized perhaps, government public health authorities…. Oh well, dream. WDW Florida main reason taking trip first place. NYC, Philadelphia, DC, Boston way extend trip might well since already East Coast us never cities went twice. solution reduced chance outcome 99%… Higher rate? Cdc stats page this. roughly US 8500/1500 cases/deaths. wore mask, washed hands, stayed home, got vaccinated. screamed, fought, lied, insulted even attacked simply trying protect themselves, protect proxy. caused delta strain become is, killing innocents including children. they're dying can't arsed admit wrong. may crass, like them. Thank clarification. Wasn’t planning traveling year anyway, initially due financial reasons planning going Universal studios annual Halloween horror nights. Im wondering it’s ok go? (fully vaccinated probably getting booster shot soon) People turn anecdotal data health leaders answers, especially should.

I fully vaccinated - Pfizer loud strong. hell **""50%-80%""** metric? type confidence interval even around that?

Maybe would data CDC [stop tracking breakthrough vital data need. Maybe we'd less cases CDC *any* foresight drop mask requirements. maybe would better trust health officials feel scammed every step way. still remember saying general public wear masks - *two months* knew should. 

At point, people really know believe anymore. least, surprising slightest. put public individual - 10 times 10 - wonder people trust them. replying person said fishing beach.

Going fair seems like bad idea. keep linking people pfizer filing clinical trial. 95% effective number COVID-19 condition lands hospital virus (SARS-CoV-2) itself. technically can't stop virus entering body. amount low enough, compliment system deal notice anything (which pathogens entering body every day dealt with). overwhelmed amount virions lower number antibodies currently expressing, dealt really notice it. However, case, gonna feel little sick body ramps production antibodies back up. order DAYS instead WEEKS like get unvaccinated infection. talk breakthrough cases, talking people end hospital COVID-19. vaccines work. built protect certain pathogen fucking keeping go long cycle might able prevent severe illness also long cycle shedding fuck ton virus. vaccine, chance contraction low, long much shed virus lower, chance infection progressing something dangerous low. good thing is, memory cells form post infection like setup infection occurred. super helpful shot arm, since contracted respiratory system, memory cells setup making reinfection lot harder. Would like understand removed? comments supported Dr Scott Gottlieb I've trying figure too. one stepped disconcerting. comparing Apples Oranges here, 80% adults Sweden received first dose number US total population. numbers gave straight Google interactive Covid map they’re actually comparing total population fully vaccinated. Sweden anything like Germany surprisingly huge portion people receive 2nd shot, many especially young people believe one two good enough. 

I admit don’t know willingness Swedes vaccinate children many shots per 100 people they’re still giving compared U.S. imply U.S. god awful compared Scandinavian countries disingenuous compare completely different data points. can't get Home Depot, I'm sure Lowes similar ones.

You also look businesses focusing industrial safety. I've gotten Moldex N95s Grainger recent past. know physical stores stock. Yes, Covid goes old. known since Q1 2020. Also specific comorbidities. 

Re: One shots. Really, interpret it? Israel, window one shot 3 weeks protocol is. months like here. Obvious would show less due smaller window exist. guess could assume 0 context others facts. risk profile tolerance... 

This kind thinking fine certain types risks. example, wearing seatbelt, getting tetanus vaccination. guess wrong, one suffer perhaps die.

Unfortunately, highly contagious disease, swimming pool. one person urinates mind swimming piss, people forced swim too.

In real way, current pandemic result travelers. Initially, people traveling China world, travelers general spreading virus widely ensuring continue suffer.

I understand mindset somehow personal decision. one tragedy million statistic etc etc Chinese say primarily, me.

Which Chinese many starting reconsider covid zero strategy

There 1.4 billion people China. obviously asked opinions are, overwhelming impression get strong, broad support zero-CoVID strategy.

There's one well known doctor, Zhang Wenhong, wrote essay vaguely implying China move away zero-CoVID strategy. huge, negative reaction public essay, wrote update saying still thought zero CoVID best strategy China moment. clearly people toying idea letting virus spread country, unpopular suggestion (rightly so, border controls (which significant impacts btw), general insecurity next outbreak hit long widespread lockdowns need be.

Lockdowns limited since mid-2020 - far limited developed world. control strategy shifted towards mass testing contact tracing, localized lockdowns specific areas particularly high numbers cases (in Chinese context, might mean dozen cases day city million people). last month, China succeeded ending serious outbreak since original one Wuhan, cities ended locked - tiny fraction country.

I'm going search source, Henry Ford hospital system something like 15-20% current hospitalized patients fully vaxxed right now. (MI) read went....shit. incredibly inhumane. delete this. vaccinated, take test trip test - even they’re required (but currently return us anyway). It’s pretty simple. 

Travel always risk, always will. Especially travel farther first world countries, Covid far worst pathogen could encounter. think perhaps Covid? Come think remember watching Futurama episode Fry got worms turned good him. “far above” anyone. US giving 4 million doses per day peak vaccination 1% entire US vaccination. countries same. knew girl ate rotten meat prepred herself. sure got from.  mention becoming less less true everyday don’t see Florida improving won’t take simplest measures. I’m sure “burning through”. means exactly huge number Floridians aren’t vaccinated won’t wear masks distance. kids definitely Trump thing. extremely pervasive opinion across political spectrums infuriates daily.  blame. know mean though Look bright side: parents students get experimental/Desantis approved Regenron treatment $1500 teacher , I'll put allí non-masking kids classroom corner, far masked ones. classroom. graduated Permian folks moved Midland summer never full time resident Midland least 4 times year many years. moved Mom home Austin 2 years ago track virus access odds getting driving NM TX spending night Snyder. West Texas always ""healthier"" even though thing....oil patch. Understand weather better summer would make bearable. Good luck persevere!!  Yes. Dat’s Israel vaccinated age 12-15 cohort two months ago shows 90% vaccine effectiveness infection (similar pre-delta studies showed spring ages) compared 45% vaccine effectiveness next age group 16-19 vaccinated six months ago. Yeah, get slaughtered sub asking legit questions. It’s real bad. Everyone thread recovered Covid. recovered mean? Assuming healthy adults need boosters double edge sword.

The science community seems split bad breakthrough cases are. could’ve seen happening Oh makes sense. Thanks. 5/8 = .625 = 62.5% stands reason satting prolonged period time would effective brain.  isn’t talked enough. Tiny rooms, tons kids. 3 ft head head, 6 hours day, 5 days week. many kids going get sick, even masks. don’t understand CDC came arbitrary 3 ft guidance hugely contagious variant they’re sticking 3 ft. classrooms small 3 ft head head distance can’t fit 25 them. Los Angeles County, 25% CA's population, almost 73% one dose almost 63% fully vaccinated 16+; almost 90% 65+ 1 dose 80% 2. high population density (and poverty) many parts county consistently largest source cases state. people see masked (even outdoors walking street waiting bus stop), cases rising, mostly 5-17 age group now, especially LAUSD testing every single one 600,000 students weekly rural (and mostly Republican) counties low vaccination rates actually suffering. L.A. hospitals getting stretched one's treated parking lots like last time.

There's vast vast difference California's Florida's handling pandemic numbers already speaking volumes. Right. vaccinated patient fare better hospitalization death. goal vaccines. 

That’s vaccines need mandated. 

We knew we’d dealing variants. now, Vaccines change every year accommodate variants. like one will. beginning pandemic. we’re ever going get end need vaccine mandates, masking, social distancing, better air filtration buildings, schools, apartments, public spaces. 

Sitting around nothing vaccines don’t prevent transmission stupid. we’d probably still polio. goal save lives. Vaccines that. 

Now go get shot.  Thanks telling folks reality want hear. management thing.  cold-chain. extremely hard set guarantee effectiveness. South Korea already one.

Nobody shitting USA Canada, except insofar saying letting vaccines expire, rather donating them.

You really need learn read carefully. knowledge worker, comfortable, familiar environment need pretend look busy I'm thinking problem frankly recharging mentally playing games helps productive. Florida reporting CDC. Florida also changed reports, numbers likely accurate prior reporting change. 

Regardless, mistakes made correct numbers. change Florida knee deep covid leader acting wantonly. Thanks judgement well — I’m affected it..but, hope you, like others, feel better so. actually park plans so. Like said post, Universal *resort*. absolutely able distance others around well staff. It’s really difficult one aware surroundings. Fuck managers, fuck “bosses”, fuck current system. Power workers.  Using nonsense assertion distrust public health safety organization proves point. counter actually wider network folks virtually available you. interaction global team DRAMATICALLY thanks things like Teams, wider use cameras, fun virtual events. 

It’s type networking. I’m type hop bar get drunk coworkers. I’ve always built relationships 1:1s personal connections. virtually video. What's purpose human one may ask? Massachusetts data breaks vax status age. Although everything good data! don’t wanna hijack, anyone good data Alabama sits terms R value peak delta? I’m vaccinated whole family, obviously, state poor vaccination rate high infections. wondering sit terms peak, since hospital system currently far beyond capacity I’m hoping we’re almost worst it… can’t work home job, please fuck sake everyone can, fight make new normal. means fewer cars road me. There's good chance I'll new team go back. team 50, would 1 3 people working office. rest team returning company's large regional offices offices Florida, Texas, Utah, etc.

The work I'll mostly filling requests managers large regional offices smaller satellite offices 50 states.


Like, live 5 minutes office huge deal go far commute goes, man nice using breaks dishes laundry.

Regardless, I'll working home 50% time return. plan even pandemic, pretty nice.  ""Won't someone think managers"" cringiest take. ever go back office job, work home going non-negotiable. better people's overall stress, better environment, generally hurt productivity. surprised disappointed want change back. ""essential"" grocery worker, options? general question die-hard WFH: get food? almost like get pay head nodding Indian yes men always say they'll ""do needful"" actually freaking clue they're doing. people vaccinated, end hospital. 

I pro-vaccine get, true. risk significantly reduced, transmission gets high enough get severely club meetings went back online, office pushed back reopening generally friends vaccinated less willing go out.

Could rising case levels?

I get it. Masks great. unfortunately, pandemic still happening. Thankfully vaccines completely changed way out, decreeing mean is. also think may underestimate amount people may still come given choice. Maybe I'm speaking here, I'm odd ball hated working home. apartment small dark keep windows covered dog barks. also sleep disorder lot harder stay awake moving home. Either way, give people choice like? They're going pick makes comfortable make productive, honestly, cares people less productive anyways. several US states, including mine, teachers *allowed* recommend masks. class sizes frequently crowded (26-32 kids pretty normal around here), best offer *maybe* 3 feet social distancing lol huddle voice video well? Yeah aren’t worried “how many hours Nintendo Switch” metric employee performance criteria going blow tank company? can’t track outcomes like crazy person 😤 best way get promoted find another job anyway. path promotion unusual this.  think said significant amount elderly, still like statistic. see find article, think go sub r/CoronavirusMichigan   mask mandates two years up. Yeah think people think way we'll back office eventually. getting skewed view redditors exact type people want stay home forever avoid personal interaction. 

Most people I've talked IRL significantly less productive working home. worked home three months honestly accomplish shit. Yup. efficient WFH could attend meetings, visit clients remotely, attend court hearings, home office. driving around town, figuring things could make would miss.

I could use toilet whenever wanted, get food fridge, comfortable whole working.

Now, waste like 2 hours every morning getting ready driving office, close door avoid people much possible, long drive home. wasteful unnecessary.

Icing cake hearing one old guard managers outside office telling everyone happy see everyone back. lots tech issues hated home dog husband time. Wonder forced us back right delta spiking...

Such bullshit reason I'm working getting asap. That's real problem.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

See press booster dose elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), Beta Delta variants, compared levels observed two-dose primary booster dose, neutralizing titers variants similar wild “The data we’ve seen date suggest third dose vaccine elicits antibody levels significantly exceed seen two-dose primary schedule. pleased submit data FDA continue working together address evolving challenges pandemic.”

As buying idea helps stay hospital. way communicated.

This might vary locale, course, States, people buying self-preservation socially conscious arguments either. Hospitals South getting flooded patients, overwhelming majority unvaccinated, clearly neither ""get vaccine protect yourself"" ""get vaccine overwhelm hospital systems"" working. I'd say even evidenced mountain reports people who, upon admitted ICU, beg plead vaccine.

People adamantly anti-vax change minds rhetoric alone. employer made us go back. teams lost 50% staff, teams lost less still everyone impacted people top office fetish. like spending day place sleep. made closest friends work best thinking done groups, battling things whiteboard. like water cooler culture. job requires bursts thinking really hard stuff. Small talk resets brain, prevents headaches gets ""unstuck"" ways solo activities like taking walk go office fairly often, pretty empty (we currently policy ""only come want"") really quite eerie. totally selfish, want come back office, want everyone else come back well.

No one making conditions work except you. exception water cooler culture BS politicking anyway. still talk people arent, probably dont miss talking you. like less time talk now. dont work place sleep, could easily find elsewhere. also think youre confusing 'hard thinking' tunnel vision. Usually isolation helps focus.

'Everyone work want cant work system'. word ideology. Couple reasons think of:

1. [The delta variant infectious, leading kids getting infected compared initial Vaccines still available kids 12, leaving vulnerable

3. School starting soon, many places either going hybrid person varying safety measures. mandating masks, aren't/can't (ahem *Florida*)

There might I'm aware of. I’ve cancelling trips since March, 2020. Making refundable reservations 2023 now. I’m optimistic, realistic. Somebody think commercial property landlords! work demand specialty. went back work sick several offers old company approached me. 

I went company offered fully remote position- willing put writing. Oh well Florida said accurate definitely believe them. Also, means people need live close big cities anymore, would help spread wealth around. might wrong here, kids allowed Universal right now?  Idk. got sick, got hospital, got ventilator, coma died. That’s know. people get unemployed homeless? callous?  wrong assume “included” pay/h?  risk continuum completely personal risk tolerance. choose go save N95s tge moments must. choose surgical cloth mask good enough. Early pandemic n NYC used two N95s three months, ideal, reused.      ask question you. least, one tried answer. said show evidence vaccine stops TRANSMISSION VIRUS, stopping hospitalizations preventing disease virus causes, prove wrong. 

Ya see, can't listen people, going convince anti-vaxxers anything.  People moving about, asking questions, returning books, bathroom noises, etc. control travel joke -- there's people coming container ships sources subjected quarantine process.

Incorrect (barring weird edge cases). Arriving ship crews quarantine, sea contact person counts quarantining still get tested isolate arrival potential Key elements Maritime Border Bans foreign ships arriving New Zealand, range exceptions, fishing ships cargo granted permission humanitarian reason compelling need ship delivered NZ Requires **testing, isolation quarantine arriving crew**. Requires majority arrivals sea isolate quarantine board ship MIQF least 14 days since last port call since last took crew, requires every person board ship meet low-risk indicators (including negative COVID-19 test) person may enter New Zealand persons arriving sea cannot appropriately isolate quarantine board ship, transferred MIQ  also spread too.

Infections means cases - again, hospitalizations deaths. oppose animal cruelty, including meat dairy said, (personally) contact kids. literally way could pass COVID unvaccinated children. Pre-covid, promotions often skipped remote people went present. 

During covid - promotions happening internal, seen external hires fill positions would likely got internal candidate.

Post Covid - see return pre-covid state, promotions go office frequently. 

Unpopular opinion - Enjoy working home now, want promotions, get ass back office 3 4 days week.  decided use wrong tool job guess that's them. Hopefully try take cloth mask scuba diving. Anyone cares buy mask protects them. Schools aren’t even going bother basic safety precautions like offering masks social distancing? hope don’t wonder outbreaks.  frustrating stupid people literally take inject anything unknown, skeptics comes actual vaccine. 

Also tired hearing even talking covid/corona. 

If actual second solition informed authorities safe sound.

Also, read title? FDA begging people take it, hand, know better tell us safe. 
Just man. Take want, GTFO misinformation.  It’s fine golf day something it’s mostly ones come Saturday escape family home. Lift murderous embargo already jfc. think least 10 fully vaccinated Florida residents (snow birds) New England foreseeable future, kind suspect lot vaccinated older population even there. No. got vaccinated, get whatever booster required, wear masks everywhere inside, don’t attend large extremely gatherings, mindful social distancing.

I never wear mask outside again. draw line there. mandated live months ago. mandated wear inside, do. Unless packed concert sporting event, never again. It’s become increasingly clear many managers entirely unnecessary

Most managers always Yes sir. manager completely holds everything together around office, she’s become one best friends even office.

There workplaces employees basically run things autonomously. day-to-day always changing manager lets us know needs done.

The Big Brother manager unneeded long work still gets done. Taskmaster manager remains heartbeat efficient workplace. don’t know details, sorry. even crazier though, truck driver vaccinated well still got it. There’s also antivaxers among us got too. 7 total. Probably delta. evidence support connection neurological impairment covid definitely evidence long covid. think point, matter proof matter extent. Sounds like cope tbh. There's still tons US jobs replaced remote workers countries. young professional worries slightly. makes difficult build relationships colleagues tougher get noticed, leaves wondering less likely promoted. Get rid managers increase pay. barely talk anymore. Couldn’t tell since can’t walk around cubes chest puffed fair weather animal rights activist would someone expresses disapproval killing dogs, eats bacon, downvotes people criticize meat consumption. currently considering positions least 85% remote, even mark company prospect me. I’ve 20 managers career *two* checked three boxes. grateful current boss one them. works another state interest returning office either. We’re supposed go back October (doubtful IMO) she’s already told staff choose 3 days office days deviates workgroups company. I’ve worked 6mo trusts trust goes long way. charts show peak last week.

You can't determine peak wave say either chart indicates peak; point ebb flow.

I agree 7,000 per day seems unrealistically high think we're kind downward trend yet. mention schools open that's likely going least keep numbers stable nothing else.

By way, Worldometer says 3,137 cases Alabama 8/19 1,614 *more* cases listed day. Global capitalism didnt exist covid 19 work home measures? Thats news me. Got source one?

*I bot, action performed automatically.

But mono, almost every adult point, people rarely get twice. also contagious cold COVID.

[There measles measles vaccine invented. modern MMR vaccine effective appears protects people long time.

[Almost every US adult chicken pox point chicken pox vaccine made. [The chicken pox vaccine appears long lasting effectiveness, making booster reason measles chicken pox pandemic long lasting effective vaccines. Examples diseases requires regular boosters flu tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (TDAP). Adults recommended get TDAP boosters every 10 years.

You might wondering there's talk COVID 19 boosters soon. There's actually controversy whether they're even necessary. [Some scientists disagree Biden's decision roll boosters right now, saying there's enough evidence support need right? knows. covid vaccine new hard study long term effectiveness.

The bottom line is, COVID new rapidly changing disease. existed 1 half years. There's still lot know it, unlike diseases listed. booster shots later become necessary, conspiracy scientists like fucking people. they've done carefully controlled studies resulted data strongly suggesting vaccine loses effectiveness time. Agreed, totally.  everyone work need mid level managers.  one find WFH jobs allow happy work life balance? Mine demands work beyond scheduled hours put time weekends figure way cram 16 hours worth work 8. We’ve lost teammates new opportunities nervous breakdowns drop management gets demanding asks us daily refer anyone onboarding. miss everyone running door 5 day actually coming end. can’t bring back people leaving premises.

I work security systems. It’s year we’re modifications existing buildings. company renting 5 buildings, keep 1. 10 floors, keep 2 3. large open spaces recently installed, partitioning single person offices.

The European Commission Brussels cutting rents. Expats 30 days per year maximum work country requested stay notice.

Only managers directors coming offices. Mine too! really seem afraid send us home we'll never go back really comes uncaring wellbeing employees.  u get them? still understand people confuse ""spike mutations"" ""vaccine derived antibodies""... i've waking seeing kind blatant ignorance science denialism sub.

Yikes! Get Vaccinated Mask people! going away anytime soon! 3rd jab booster shots delta eventually! Given well vaccines holding severe disease, hospitalizations, deaths, seems like mistake. majority us vaccinated ready get back normal think. kinds ""managers"" need actual work do.

No shit. bosses busy shit. long one complaining us, we're left alone.

My rules like this. boss seems think similarly, that's good.

* Urgent? Pick phone.
* Need quick response nothing fire? Instant message.
* need answer today? Email.

I've stopped email time. open background, check tasks. people send ""urgent"" emails laugh. even scarier that. like 1486 F1 car crashes week. kids already covid, fine. I'm worried kids missing education Yeah, tons people need this. think majority, number people work better designated space outside home. wonder many people even left get infected. virus must point burn combination infections vaccinations. Despite headlines Florida middle pack terms vaccinations. thing delta variant contagious also indirectly spreading immunity. Bosses eventually retire move on; embrace creative thinking thrive. fear remote work irrational, giving employees freedom yields happiness, that’s job satisfaction, potentials increase productivity. tell firsthand I’m much happier, I’m focused treating colleagues lot positively before. I’m also beginning experience slowly newfound level energy work utmost effectiveness before. Envy world! feel you. like collaboration person. zoom it’s easy people paying attention joining leaving late kind thing. Almost friends city work friends ( every one us transplants) . 

And separation place game work nice. last year much stuff blurs together it’s 3 rooms . ""BuT DeAtHs?"" bots now?  least, that's existing recommendation boosters immunocompromised.  FDA CDC said anything official yet boosters general population.  

This sort ""vendor lock in"" good thing general. Wow, i’m shocked caught soon serious symptoms. scary.   -UK Data suggests even one dose remains highly effective preventing serious illness. mRNA we're talking 94-96% reduction risk accross ENTIRE population (this means grouping eldery younger people). 

-Breakthrough cases happen variety reasons (ie waning immunity). unexpected though. 

-Even seeing deaths vaccinated unexpected (the frail people high vaccination rates, vaccines less effective/covid risk people)

-On personal note, unless demographics risk covid, try stop worrying leave sub, full doom gloom. LOL -- yes, phrase. many times I've heard phrase. fill confidence.  live Asheville go Boone regular basis remember town issues original strains Covid due App-State, unlike rest state, seems like they're talking Delta seriously.

I wish rest state would.   wonder vaccine efficacy calculated studies controlled peoples behaviors. studies performed covid still feared public. People cautious still wore masks. Now, people pandemic going on. largely due CDC saying vaccinated need worry maskless. led many people changing behaviors leading many vaccinated people contract COVID levels seen studies. Ross Geller said: Fine me! make mention it, go accept it...

None things are, imo really be, tied employment. tightly coupled work insurance be. ie afraid people close outside world

Well, two things say that. 1) trying solve problem problem, 2) honestly, tough cookies. think problem would sort out, either people adapting life, people getting making change, professional help needed. 

I'm saying wrong also consider talking dating instead. Like office match-maker, weekly blind dates, etc. would feel like pretty strange place. Well, that's tying work socializing would feel like too, already kind established. make right though. people work home lot management positions longer necessary. They're willing inconvenience entire office people rather inconvenience themselves. got second dose June. Honestly sounds like thing preventing replaced effect company culture, understand. it’s gravy something goes wrong bad quarter it’s easy blame guy even putting enough hours. Okay, want edit something, makes look like think long term side effects already know about.  Oh plenty dumb. take free vaccine dose Horse wormer! WFH require scheduled meetings? Impromptu meetings super easy virtually cultural difference encountered one overly polite workers. comfortable admitting understand poorly written directions, ask enough questions, would push back say ""No, good solution, need re-think request."" compare driving drunk. may hurt yourself, may hurt anyone else could end hurting lot people reason Damn, sorry you. 
What effects worst you? go specifically could replaced gusto.com tomorrow far payroll goes

(don't tell boss) know mate, mean ask me, towers planes going probably overweight, thats they're big! Holly days. That's all.

I assume might different different countries almost everyone enjoying hollydays available vaccination.

(Irresponsible? Might be).

But bet 1st September (when vacations ends) vaccination rate surge.

I might wrong. course sources like I'm right.

It reads: national tourists allow reach 80% hotel occupancy August. typically higher ups management issues this. anyone else. That's 74.207% people 12 double vaccinated. hard time seeing 12k even delta variant. Next up: “why need managers?”

That’s they’re worried. mean like driving insurance rates up? Inevitably joining fight virus getting vaccinated wearing masks paying insolence stupidity others. One thing sure Covid revealed idiots nation. Jake Paul, you? They're shit, transferred cubicle open office, wanted cube back. I'm waiting see employer going send us back

Honestly, this. decent employer, would've shit together months ago rate. getting point zero excuses making decision companies 5,000-10,000 employee range already made decisions, even larger companies making decisions. ""If don’t you’re fired"" lol yup taste upper manager it. Without prior infection parents vaccinations March would begin wear taking prior infection account high immunity foreseeable.

Edit: long ""very mild infections last year"" PCR positive infections ""I think Covid"". I’m saying liar. didnt ban mask mandates. allows opt outs. people would throwing hisssy fits otherwise, like every state masks mandated. wear mask vaccinated don’t appreciate lying governor did. Thanks productivity doubled along getting life back cost savings. win win imo. 

The ones stand loss middle managers (not good amount) service purpose micromanaging shit death. 

The switch remote platform added plenty systems micromanage everything us real results display. much need managers seen prior pandemic. boss evolved jack brings lot team.

Some old school team bosses watch struggle day day cause quality thing brought table old school bullshit software put place already way accuracy.

Really wish would quit fighting it. going cost lots great talent end. .... contracted CHURCH camp! would Jesus do? would vaccinate anyone everyone! exactly trolling, didn’t word meant well. Mail Clerk. reason office couple hours afternoon, scan collect days mail, send outgoing stuff. 8 hours everyday, January asked work part time. I'm still there, I'm going back school zoom. teacher. really hope next year. Outcome based work. presence based.

Thank you. Every job metrics associated it. ""Time spent chair"" never one them. managers understand employees really do, thus fall back ""chair time.""

I truly believe manager time check chair time otherwise micromanages, likely position needs removed. managers better things care long sit desk. long tickets get resolved promptly, projects proceed schedule, regular maintenance happening, happy. think managers worried jobs become irrelevant. workers performing duties efficiently someone standing companies need pay people standing workers? everyone working home productive without managerial interruptions issues really company needs someone ensure jobs done employees kept loop issues, updates, training requirements. done far fewer people currently place middle management.

I manager would read everyone's emails, browse computer data, spend hour every evening leaving detailing lazy enough company. went vacation goals met quickly efficiently time fix issues created. higher ups loved change. came back productivity level plummeted again. got rid improvements let us work better put reprimand files ""slacking off"" away.

One coworkers took documentation done away HR VP company. got moved different department different branch (I assume plummeted well) got manager let us kojob. First day started filing conference room ou habit. told came said simply, ""look adults. know supposed doing. need hold hands. problem door open. Otherwise I'd like teach help support better. next weeks we'll set time spend you, go home great evening. See tomorrow"". left hour early day feeling like gotten away something. good boss worth keeping manager. would able run departments like honestly. capable running 1. I'm sure somewhere complaining bad would let employees stay home. point role berate everyone worked her. everyone home less access role would quickly seen unnecessary (hopefully). Yeah, get 10 minutes large city, see precautions here. hope feel better! Somethings really sucked would get random windows hours felt “improvement” you’d get coughing spell. opportunity got used sleep. helped sleep pillow chest/back 4 pillows stacked lay head. would also call online doctor prescribed set steroids temporarily improve breathing much cough. Worth shot see eases symptoms. Make sure monitor oxygen well. Makes sense, US giving shots months countries began vaccinating elderly.  elaborated, meant long haul COVID well documented thing, don’t see problems caused easily reversing itself. we’re going 2 years winter, kind already 2 years old. spreadsheets keep construction crews paid. much get sentiment, know they'd pretty upset took without replacement lined Friday. Cogs machine jazz. forget Large Commercial Real estate brokers companies. poor guys going lose big covid. /s  I’m vaccinated I’m worried journalists can’t convey science facts. always hate statements like “There going back.” ""the new normal"". said New York City would never 9/11 housing market would never fully recover. Guess what? NYC returned housing market insane roof again.

I would love never go back office, little faith old school bosses able anything known done decades. got return eventually. trust anything else. 

That sitting zoom also give narcissistic satisfaction physically surrounded people afraid them, jump enter room, constantly kiss butts. obviously talking people choose get vaccinated. cannot. Doctors know cases make difference.

Those want get vaccinated can, using situations like relative, disgusting think lot bosses managers want still feel like bosses managers. walking around office acting like something. “going lunch meetings” clients either. sitting cushy office nice view. home house like everyone else. Like regular employee. teams bring part problem work team got dissolved moved around teams, weekly meetings kept getting cut company got busier went least weekly interaction maybe 1-2× month, plus losing supervisor I'd whole time great. They're bad company, place me. Delta contagious chicken pox. Please stop spreading misinformation.
 Easier write drunk work emails WFH Yes! Sure was. Yellow journalism huge deal back then. Hell started Spanish American war. seriously fucking say no. get something going coworkers team refuse come do? Hoooooly shit

Is seriously thing? Hahahaha 100 country 65 million. point Covid going anywhere, we're gonna live number now. alarmingly high threatening hospital systems. 100 deaths day bad flu season, shut society that. rich folks angle one think would best.  Doubt bullshit government day... sure thing, lives rich EVER ones get screwed over? way.  clearly 'experiment black/poor' situation.  Open eyes get fingers ears then. IMO, work getting done quality work remains improves…I see issue remote work. family member isn’t able get vaccinated medication needs take dr told get it. can’t medical reasons? also get care get covid? that’s modelling BC, expect Alberta twice since hit 2200+ daily new cases months back  daily cases ever around 1300ish.  Can’t wait see slew vaccination mandates I've gone office times past 18 months reason, nobody end working boss's office lunch go home. force anyone come back office, miss around others office setting even I'm talking them.

Of COURSE reduce vaccination rates - people dumb rocks. thought well established antivaxxers/antimaskers problem killing old people? Microvascular damage brain heart? Isn’t reversible someone young &amp; healthy? Isn’t normal get minor long term damage serious flu, eventually heals short while? 

For example study suggests people stop smoking 40 live long someone never smoked. I’m really hoping Caps make vaccination requirement go.

Mask filtration tightly-fitting, masks filter 90% particles larger 300 nanometers diameter, quite filter 80% particles smaller.

For **particles 300 nanometers, 99.9% get blocked N95, 99.6% get blocked surgical mask** (assuming perfect fits). Standardish, 600 threads-per-inch cotton mask block 98.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

Droplet/Aerosol single coronavirus 90 nanometers diameter.(we sneeze, cough, exhale dry, perfectly separated viruses)

Generally, exhaled coughed sneezed viral particles suspended liquids bodies; mostly, **droplets range size 400 nanometers 42,000 nanometers**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Combined TLDR;

Most masks worn correctly keep 90% viral particles (or in, case may be).

When parties masked, even 90% efficacy becomes 99%...

90% exhaled particles get blocked way out, leaving 10% air; briefly.

90% 10% would blocked, allowing 1% exhale in.

(That 1% drops even distance exhaler inhaler.) Yup. got test back November in-network provider. supposed clue lab use out-of-network? got bill $100. I’m going pay dispute it.

Ahhh invisible hand market magic Unless physically job, shouldnt specific location. That’s hospital said well. Anybody who’s ventilator veryyy slim chance making one. know that’s horrible it’s truth. Thanks thought answer :-) tougher. They've received vaccines three civilians ever see entire life. trust one because, that's it. 

You're decidedly weaker. They'll standing face serious consequences. You... gave in. Would brother? sister, mother, father?

Not saying what's wrong what's right. We're human. genes virus could targeted vaccine, there's good reason spike protein main choice: virus infects cells, viral protein ""seen"" immune system spike protein. 

Coronaviruses enveloped viruses, means use lipid bilayer cells outer coating, spike proteins poking through. hide immune system since harder antibodies immune cells find spike proteins among thousands proteins normally cell surface. types viruses lipid coating (such adenoviruses) strategy universal among viruses.

The reason targeting spike protein vaccines make antibodies spike train immune cells recognize spike viral particle lungs blood floating around trying infect cells. Stopping virus get inside cell far effective way stop virus entirely. 

Now, virus get starts undergoing replication cycle, genes transcribed proteins produced. However, kept almost entirely within cell, chance adaptive immune system (mostly B cells) see react. 

There process cells chop proteins present bits immune cells check weird things happening inside cell like infection (called MHC complex). However, viruses way shut another sneaking method. I'm sure SARS-CoV-2 mechanism surprised does. 

Bottom line, yes, antibodies different viral targets useful, point depending non-spike antibodies, already late. 

Source: Ph.D. virologist bet lot AZ yes (50million doses manufactured locally), blood clotting reports backfired bit. completely messed messaging view inferior dangerous vaccine help.

There also agreements buy 10 million Pfizer shots November 2020 extra 10 million Feb 2021.

Many mistakes made, enter quite agreements late 2020 buy vaccine, enough vaccinate whole population 2021. giving away surplus, know yet, June 2021 announced donate 20 million AZ Asia Pacific region. Headed work major event mid sept mid October. Average 2,000,000 annual attendance. 

It represents third annual income, I’ll lose contract don’t go. 

I’ll shoulder shoulder roughly 50k people four weeks. Outside social distancing possible. 

Vaxed March/April. 

Should go ahead lie first two doses get booster go? hate even consider seems like good idea lot viewpoints.    makes sense. much unvaccinated tie identity accepting it, equal likely larger number people view vaccine symbol caring virtue character. social capital likely feel like gain booster probably valuable many people medical benefits. think many people ran get unauthorized 3rd shots boosters authorized. chance copy paste text? Paywall. Way way way many dumb people really distressing read this.   true, that’s triage works. Otherwise every Ed would turning away unvaccinated droves. lining hall. fact they’re clogging every hospital diabetics, people heart conditions…are turned away routed hospital. See shit like makes think it. 

Vaccinated march. (Moderna)

Got sick around July 10th. Sore throat, light runny nose. Turned dry wet cough. Got covid test 3-4 days symptomatic came back negative. intermittent light fevers. 

I still sick though mostly better. Coughing turned sinus infection antibiotics helped much expected. Back preventative asthma medicine again. Still cough small amount phlegm up. fatigued lately. 

Maybe flu cold something. part remains unconvinced wasnt covid. Please, dying area.  
Thank  Yea got Jesus side. It'll fine! Horse dewormer, hear? **/s** actively make choice go public expose people non-vaccinated self.

It's kind true actively choose go public part ""expose people non-vaccinated self"" actual deliberate action, simply byproduct absence committed prior action. makes much sense saying ""you chose go public expose people un-pierced ears"". latter part statement really apply; simply chose go public gotten ears pierced. Again, there's conceivably infinite number states I'm choose leave house, need excuse every one them.

Furthermore, ""going public"" kind bogus designation well. I'm alive, exist *somewhere* given time, presence people arbitrary place existence staying locked inside home. Actually, people physically home *only* exist ""out public""; ""go"" much simply exist there. sense, *not* public man-made contrivance luxury; treating absence like kind calculated invasion actually one's natural state human animal. sense, people choosing much I'm choosing are. separate spaces works ways.

So yeah, comparable getting drunk piloting change example that’s hard you; going nude public fine well

imo there's legitimate case fine; literally countries legal (e.g. Spain). guess authoritarian point view policing things might offend sensibilities fair game you. tell started: man woman love much… could seen coming. - Federal Government arguable immune response spike protein causes side effects vaccine (clots, low platelets, heart inflammation). spike protein also covers virus, maybe people COVID end symptoms sick developed immune response, would gotten vaccine well. really know research done that.


That said probably better deal problem also severe viral pneumonia. Extreme population density major issue there. also 40% fully vaccinated. Yeah, taste smell part rain definitely effected, parts cerebral cortex. COVID cause memory loss, brain fog, Alzheimer’s, dementia, etc. would inclined say COVID literally make dumber (needless say, everyone). tell NYT articles based capitalization alone. don’t vaccines?  Paywall. Makes easier limit illegal gatherings police find rule breakers moved Brevard almost 40 years ago NEVER went back. still follow news around though. Republican friends wearing masks getting vaxed hope (but older generation). Great. Hopefully Australia follows suit vaccinated. That's one would think funny part county Villages highest vaccination rate entire state. 70% county 90% 65+. look up, Sumter County. entire panhandle higher candidate list far zombie wasteland goes. counties 20-30% range. Agreed. unvaccinated lowest priority hospitals. Personal responsibility consequences 3 different vaccines.  I'm boat. 2nd shot wrecked me, almost went ER tbh. got shot January really need booster i'm freaking too, want go :( Meanwhile Melbourne masks inside out. Recently recommended school aged children wear Comorbidities like overweight? might well 70% population.  Nope, ran off. Try smaller words? IKR! ""Curfews"", really? makes virus sound like sort nocturnal boogeyman emerges past x-o'clock scurries back lair sunrise. ""to incentivize getting vaccinated""

Why quotes?

The CDC actually ever say anything like this. everyone else saying that's reasoning. Pretty sure there's Walenski quotes affirming gambling vaccinations. Right ! Pfizer vaxxed March - husband breakthrough infections now. intense enough benefited steroid antibody shots. Mine mild far. Mine week - extremely careful wearing KN95 everywhere husband’s family hosted event many unvaccinated hotspot. vaccinated unvaccinated got covid- unvaccinated got much sicker. didn’t even go too. R0 8 guess it’s wonder :( delta need stop saying breakthrough rare. first article hasn’t. It’s West Texas, Covid never existed  OP reaction 2nd dose? Let us know forgettable country know little done anyone. realize job vax half planet first. Nope. chance. failure lies feet Republican governors. Let it.  Every time person doesn’t get infected Covid-19, vaccines remarkably good even now, transmission necessarily doesn’t happen. side coin set failure (in messaging least) going back acting like everything normal 

Certainly fault CDC. Vaccine rates slowed crawl cases/hospitalizations/deaths extremely low. never going able make vaccinated people wear mask prepare surge two months away people willingly taking vaccine. I’ve seen movie, didn’t end well 💯 trash Crazy thing would saved life free, readily available.

Unfortunately propaganda convinced take it. ""muh 

IOC Japanese government responsible mass murder Please take painkiller sure completely fault antivaccine people. delta variant came India people even access vaccine. way really end try get people access shot. I'm almost 12 hours post second shot now. Feeling ok. See feel hours 🙂 fair lot became nurses leave country, many done. Yeah make great point risk infection. Maybe risk debilitating symptoms isn’t especially high infected, probability contraction COVID-19 high pandemic.

I wish could explain nuances “long-COVID” effectively right it’s terrifying folks think get COVID one-in-ten shot debilitated. Maybe that’s exaggeration certainly seems like isn’t much clarity given this. wish two studies go of. even far good seems. eat McDonald’s? yes, they’re letting far worse bodies everyday 🤷‍♀️ vaccines undoubtedly working objective metrics seen across world. However also perfect. Vaccines work better people vaccinated possible get infected vaccinated. still reliance herd immunity vaccines truly work properly, true virus question extremely contagious immunity wanes period time, emerging evidence hence booster shots.

It absolutely case #1 problem low level vaccination, problem also affecting vaccinated people. think asymptomatic case COVID couple months ago I’m fully vaccinated. didn’t get tested I’m convinced Long COVID. headaches every day, I’m tired, it’s making fibromyalgia flare even worse usual. It’s hell wouldn’t wish anyone. people medically exempt pretty much negligible non-existent amount, since unlike vaccines, Covid ones live virus vaccines meaning immunosuppressed definitely get them. dozens us! Given enough time, sort out. See: /r/HermanCainAward part reason old people stop caring. They’re vaccinated kids vaccinated yet refuse see fear infecting them. old people wonder kids ever view interaction safe rest nearly lives, stop caring. antivaxxers covidiots relegated Bebo, MyYearbook, Friendster. chance voluntarily hospitalized due age status could receive regeneron treatment something else? Keep mind plan right manufacture 10 billion vaccine doses 2021. Circling back 2 billion citizens richest countries speed bump 2 3 months terms vaccine availability poorest countries. saying makes right better, production absolutely insane. enough doses 3 jabs everybody world well end 2022. layman certainly know. But, hazarding guess, would surprised relative level protection covid exactly across two populations (vaxxed vs unvaxxed). guess would unvaccinated would greater benefit (immunologically) covid vaccinated. Similarly, may vaccinated people likely taken precautions avoid catching covid, thus people among vaccinated benefit covid.

Either way, presence covid convalescent people unknown numbers among sample populations represents uncontrolled confounding factor likely makes efficacy numbers incomparable trials. We? hospital? daughter Sophomore year UAH.

It understanding masks required building dorm room.

Guess didn’t think would reckless Children pack classrooms other.

There phrase need remember … “Duty chill Considering NFL mandates vaccines player, hopefully fans attending games. Let antivaxholes try quack pseudo-remedies remove general population. Maybe we'll finally get handle covid.   Agreed. 

The UK study linked make attempt distinguish symptoms interfere daily life vs scratchy throat two weeks: ""When considering debilitating symptoms, estimates 12 weeks post infection ranged from
1.2% 20 year old cases 4.8% 60 year old cases (CONVALESCENCE [4]) [High Confidence].""

And agreed, numbers seen viruses well similar rates. issue current rate transmission things like Delta variant naive population. normal year, 10% chance catching regular flu, without mitigations. However, Delta, restrictions vaccines, I'm guessing chances infection rise close 100%, no? comparing long-term sequalae covid viral infections fair IMO, chances yearly infection drop flu-like levels.

Also, unclear dehabilitating symptoms long covid happen dangerous underlying mechanism involving microclotting coagulation general: different flu, EBV, etc., think lumped viruses. Watch Virginia: track cases vaccination status. percentage breakthroughs, hospitalizations, deaths among vaccinated rise it’ll fairly apparent.

I’m definitely getting Pfizer booster I’m eligible. odds vaccinations.  Oh look, spreading anti vax fear mongering long covid even data making excuses.

The thing trash anti vax fearmongering.  ^(why require citizens health expemption?) probably Delta variant.

Delta overwhelming variant US time. likely Delta. Freedom pay medical bills It’s worms, mange. give wild coyotes foxes. people going rub cat flea medicine backs necks next?  Good him. true man principle. big part USA reject anything ""experts"" derogatory term eyes, also selective mindset want fatalistic ""If I'm going get flu covid, I'm going get it, God decide""

Of course, start feeling short breath flu covid run doctor God want suffer, people Ugh... poor man. 

I slight cough started days ago. I'm vaccinated, I'll assume I'll fine. 

But fear still there, know? Since takes 4 weeks post-infection qualify diagnosis, don’t think there’s data yet since barely 4 weeks ago “breakthrough cases” became thing one systematically keeping track them. 

But that’s completely irrelevant since long COVID documented, scientifically supported diagnosis, trash WSJ article would believe. Semi-lockdowns simply don’t work. mean within 3 6 months last shot. dozens shots life. Unless global warming crushes us first. late--the vaccine added crayons several weeks ago. seems getting worse. Uhmm... wait, y'all charged vaccine? Goddamn. America, huh.  I'm sure saying here. saying reasonable people get vaccinated us took vaccine relatively safe, unvaxxed still pose major threat everyone:

 - risk mutations (especially coming breakthrough cases vaccinated) resistant vaccine
 - risk major long-term health complications breakthrough infection
 - increased burden health care system
 - Occupying ICU beds hospital resources crowd non-covid patients wind dying/with worse outcomes result. Welcome world academic publishing think wasn’t much surprised people like existed, surprised many people broken. would see dumbfounded look faces got unenrolled.

Glorious. Keep up. Expel unvaccinated students universities please. fully expect major businesses require moment full FDA approval realized. full approval protects liabilities.  Lmao yeah I’m going without third shot think grandparents. They're safe.

My mom 70s. took two weeks ago get illicit booster. Booster, mask, distance, right now, say high risk folks. Finally good use thoughts prayers

Ofc vaxxed good chance recovery  Trump told people get vaccine tonight's rally got booed. That's crazy vaccine conspiracists becoming mean initial comment quote dr says vaccines work well enough, already know mask social distancing also necessary make work, it’s cooperation thats problem Glad hear he's feeling better!  future reference. Vaccines never 100% disease. They're like army 10,000,000 instead army 50,000 fight it.

Mild illness expected. SARS-COV2 likely end seasonal cold people repeated exposure. religious people, supposed honest caring, lying infecting others? Interesting. (the ME/CFS community) hopeful. date, we've largely ignored little medical funding, possible there's easy fix found almost one's looking.

With long covid folks, we're hopeful millions people long covid force recognizing condition front society's consciousness apply appropriate resources solving it.

Because rate going, *everyone* going get covid, single person catch it. reported rates long covid seem 5 15%, even hundreth that, still means many millions people become permanently disabled. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

If thats case, feel worked. possible test false negative. Press release December 2020: mean total delivery 53.8 million Astra Zeneca vaccine doses 2021, covering whole population requirements.""

The rollout botched many ways, sure one them. I'm sure sucks worse, tell tell that. Yeah hospitalization. Unless sit home go 'its old pneumonia i'm fine.' (Admittedly probably rare).

The ICU difference unvaccinated 1/75th odds go ICU pretty good indicator vaccine efficacy. want stay ICU. Yep. Crap me, childless employed 40-something, it’s much worse elderly people kids. youngest niece lost full year preschool, like, well kindergarten now. mom lonely she’s gotten bit depressed. We’re going things, point mental health won’t okay isolation. going long term effects brains coming years. Faux News ignores fact Proud Boys showed started attacking folks, including clearly marked journalist hit behind lead pipe — thank goodness hearing helmet.

Plus involvement someone charged Jan 6th insurrection DC. right, even believe conspiracy theories I've internalized them. still bunch ingredients shots virus. good argument. current data referring covid rates Canada relative per-capita rates infection. works 85 90% effective.

We extend time doses 4 months, I've shown US, seem less effective - 4 month interval seems difference note, recall reading paper said longer interval resulted better protection, possible that's difference here.

If that's case, booster shot bring guys back 85-90% range. county surrounded ocean leaders willing close borders, probably lot less cases too. Would great know kind testing done. covid tests equal. critiquing data, actual prevalence testing vaccinated unvaccinated. would assume less likely vaccinate would also less likely get tested. Would interesting point look always issue, healthy people get worry less. vaccine supposed help rest us. 

What healthy anyway, vaccinated unvaccinated tend misunderstand means. Anyone chooses politics science blind, regressive, bitter fool. case here. seem bit confused. conspiracy theory someone takes event, blames government, pretty much evidence. Working backwards, Operation Northwoods never happened. something going qualify. Gulf Tonkin public incident people thought government cover up. military incident bunch finger pointing lying like other. Tuskegee experiments fucked thing gov enlisted. ""event"". Tuesday (Saudi syndrome desert Storm). ""event"" associated MK ultra. CIA instead military. major event, idiots performing experiments own. 

As poisoning alcohol. fact check that. sorry hear that. helps, absolutely terrified outcome. Nowhere near going through, even standard low blood pressure already pretty debilitating TBH...I imagine adding POTS that, palpitations, fatigue, dysautonomia, brain fog, risk clots.

Do think long covid research might end helping you? hope turns way. Home Depot them. got bunch 3M aura n95s They're working building ones got sick Delta infectious chickenpox, maybe even measles. doubt every single one would gotten sick without vaccine, especially since Democrats really diligent masking, whole hell lot would have. bunch people house week work house, without masks wear mask either. heard phone didn’t really hear said, heard person phone say “covid” point conversation, afraid saying someone company covid exposure. horrible headache I’m scared gave covid. could wrong don’t know conversation about, heard word “covid.” see feel tomorrow. bad stupid website work acknowledge vaccinated. even though vaccinated state sponsored event health workers. seriously give up!   tip? mom is. got one work brother didn’t get chance buy more, sadly. Luckily recovered covid week two ago he’s fully vaccinated. I’m hoping he’ll right need worry mom. surprised cancel concert hurricane way. bad idea hold delta everywhere, anyway. much like premature celebration. July 4th ""we're free virus"" celebration ill-advised enough, need another false hurrah. I’m planning talking doctor Pfizer vaccine becomes FDA approved whether getting third dose makes sense me.

My understanding vaccine becomes FDA approved doctors allowed prescribe off-label use, use booster eight months age groups. little bit science also. Hydroxychloroquine weird side effect. zinc ionophore. binds zinc increases cellular uptake zinc. Zinc potent anti viral. good thing good studies good results. taking natural zinc ionophore last year, flavonoid call Quercetin Dihydrate. side effects, cheap, whether works not, TF knows.   Ask wear N95 masks. people blocked morally complicit manslaughter eyes. Scum. I've canceled travel plans Sept. Oct. I'm waiting wave over. mercury mRNA vaccines J&amp;J vaccine. I… kind feel like, take medicine specifically humans maybe exist anymore… current data: 42% US Pfizer Delta according large Mayo Clinic dataset: Pfizer Matt Shea wants lead revolution looks like dorky accountant. Good luck dude. I've posted comments past even though people get vaccinated viruses like influenza still get disease. get downvoted looks like understand spreading fear took 10 weeks courses immunology vaccinations.

I know general vaccine's main role body develop enough antibodies 14 28 days body prevent virus replicating multiplying. No, people desperate need chaos seems

Notice headlines always amount cases, hospitalizations/deaths least won’t worms. Honestly, concerned algorithms Facebook uses construct feeds individual disinformation posts. creates feeds based clicks likes, almost inevitably ends people giant groupthink bubble. could argue least added fuel fires face today. God wish (TX) Military know that's part job. sympathy kids, I’m afraid.....at point anyone willingly chooses take vaccine ALREADY figuratively dead me, actually dying much change. time feeling side effects, fine take painkillers.

Just, normal quantity. Yep, long-covid adjacent (I ME/CFS, long covid looks likely condition), cannot stress enough terrified people outcome.

It's worse death. become living ghost life little agency, little actually do. can't even walk dog around block without crashing hard I'm even able play video games (not enough energy) week. assumption vaccine meant heavily supplement masks, replace (like wearing seatbelts driving safely poor weather. situation, probably would.

See issue, includes data vaccines vs alpha without waning.

I want see delta vaccinated vs delta unvaccinated make red pill. wonder breakthrough infections people really vaccinated. saw story nurse injected people saline instead antivax. 

I'm honestly kind worried really got covid shot hardly side effects pharmacist shot overheard saying antivax stuff. 

I need look see there's way test really vaccinated. didn’t even appointment, walked got it. first went Walgreens Pfizer told Costco moderna. Take ID, insurance card one vaccine card. membership needed. come bedtime. fml can’t fight willfully ignorant truth facts… go here? hope Canada able publish data this. I'd like know time booster! :) vaccinated. worried talking about, putting words mouth?

A good scientist biased hold data high pedestal results. think thinking politician someone else agenda...

A study study -- assuming conducted good faith good methodology, ""trustworthy"" relevant. thinking politics again. I'm simply saying, scientist, study generalize well current situation Delta US non-full-PPE wearing randos street. numbers speak exactly say: risk breakthrough infection high-PPE population vaccine 95% efficacy Alpha strain prevalent time. cannot applied directly different population (who wear PPE like that) different efficacy different strain different prevalence time...

Right, peer reviewed evidence anything long covid vaccines yet -- study accepted NEJM? Anyway, people thread elsewhere repeating chance long covid vaccine negligible. rare case even attempt support statement, mistakenly cite study ""proof."" reflects misunderstanding science results generalize outside presented paper. make study ""not trustworthy.""  problem is, still taking ICU beds. Vaccines getting less less effective. People like acknowledge it. Right I'm hoping covid pill expected come year end stop Corona. misinformation hurting poor, gullible people. take vaccine mRNA never used before. people refuse learn advancement science understand medical technology advanced much cell phone technology like Samsung Apple know made/ works buy. people using deworming medicine treat virus. Virus parasites 2 different thing. Vaccines help create antibodies deworming medications kills worm parasites. Parts humanity trouble. extension big initially thought. originally slated get second shot 4 months later ended getting 30 days after.

We're around 75% double dosed already. stuck original extended interval, anywhere near that. Oof, wish well recovering. tried scent training? involves sniffing 4~ seperate, strong odors every day months. showed positive results small study.

Hopefully boosters rolled soon know friends got covid last year get vaccinated spring, getting covid shots massively helped long covid symptoms. Would nice get whole world vaccinated start boosters relatively healthy people. Lol literally proving point article. states cases kids increase less 2% require hospitalization 0% fatal... Maybe read Exactly  won’t tolerate nascar slander Anti-vax: virus hoax. 
Also Anti-vax: govt hiding real cures virus. 
Also Anti-vax: govt pushing fake vaccines work. 
Also Anti-vax: ignoring logic? virus hoax! 
Also Anti-vax: stupid? year ago people got sick didn’t need note school doctors saying stay home isolate. need test, Covid. 

I know least 3 people happened one kids it. test later, negative test get back school. 

They never “counted” either saying happening too. knew someone taking dog dewormer self-diagnosed illness read internet would cure self-diagnosed illness. alternative medicine quack I’m assuming. pandemic. seems common theme people. Yeah mean come on, considering things feels like one time’s..

Anti-vaxxers: poet come elegant solution put shit right now. Ontario get new cases, new hospitalizations, new ICU patients daily vaccination status. Still breaking age, releasing vaccination status deaths, it’s start. Really depends know SIX people who've already vaccinated least months Pfizer (same flavor got) contracted COVID last month half

Man, hear anecdotes like so...foreign experience? I've literally known three people who've COVID *the entire pandemic* (all minor cases)

Just kinda crazy different different people's experiences 12.5% bf last checked. I’ve working fitness industry 21 years consider healthy.  meaningless. data tracked since December 13th, 2020. course vaccines widely available December, tracking deaths since pandemic began. sympathy world kids, zero parents.

The children could died Covid parent’s foolishness.

These parents advised cousin, nurse…she repeatedly tried convince them, instead, idiotically believed conspiracy nonsense. Lost 60% taste it’s mostly back 100%. Absolutely smell still - like zero. Word. lot people seem think it’s antidote method prevention.....I’m hoping it’s desperation clouding thinking really arent confused vaccine works time. Damn really love USA 

Making space immigrants Facebook one worst things happen people Earth. Probably media influence. 

That fear doesn’t come thin air. Compared 71.95% Canadians least one dose, 63.86% Canadians doses. VACCINE PRODUCTION. Watched protests tiktok. bunch absolute arseholes. Thoughts prime immune system prayers boost builds longevity memory t-cells.   prefer honesty, compared weird PR stuff they've done try promote vaccines, led unvaccinated people wearing masks less people trusting less unbiased source medical science. Yes u/cjdking pretty overweight   Wait…. Israeli data held really high pedestal it’s optimistic everywhere else.

Now you’re saying it’s trustworthy? numbers speak right there.

I don’t think everything black white here.

No evidence peer reviewed yet vaccinated people equal risk long COVID. wrong even thing? honestly think anti-vaxx ideology political

No, convenient people pretend like is. Anything score points ""their team."" 21 jeez state got like 2000 day. one even cares anymore random horse medicine better vaccine millions people already systems months? Hey we're 2020 again. overweight?  Also, extremely frustrating unproven anecdotal posts (such infinite posts vaccinated people suffering) used evidence current data people “believe” “fear”.

That official data. still confirming vaccines still extremely effective preventing serious illness death, minimizing symptoms. 

People say trust data, trust science. wait! suspicious, trust Reddit posts data aligns anxiety. That’s exactly anti Vaxxers do. came Sydney apparently although know happened NZ closed border us months ago. Every case NSW, Victoria, ACT NZ traced back one unvaccinated, unmasked limo driver transporting overseas pilots Sydney airport. Thanks dickhead.

Oh reasons lack trust. thing number folks vaccinated concerns all.

Best believe concerns got vaccine anyway seems best right now. can't stay indoors forever pandemic ending time soon.

All reason people weigh personal risks get life see fit then.

Enjoy isolation, though! Risk vs reward. risk vaccines proven infinitesimally small, reward potentially tamping wave delta infections could high. government established minimum baseline safety, think makes perfect sense aggressive possible pushing new approaches curtailing spread Covid. time err side boldness versus caution, safety still forefront.   time traveled country 2-3 times year. people fancy cars, large houses, wardrobes, traveled. gone nowhere two years. everything seems like unnecessary risk, whatever country I’d travel to. miss every day.

  Thats 96% infected, assuming came contact virus least since vaccination.  Yup. People say think children suffering long term covid. Well need children wear masks covid, probably need wear masks indefinitely flu season too. Scotland week (they go back weeks earlier England), cases SHOOTING led lot people say *must* schools, look age breakdown we're seeing children parents (25-44) much represented seems hitting age groups locations again, concerning number people able infected seem diminishing all, matter many catch it. Either young adults two main cities catching repeatedly, showing signs close getting yet.  one spewing misinformation, unsourced. simply corrected you, replied snarky ""source"" learning look facts yourself. congrats. Maybe next time learn spew misinformation. Current CDC guidance:

 * Isolate tested positive COVID-19 prior 10 days experiencing COVID-19 like right track. Fair enough.

Do think anti-vax people Canada? logic makes zero sense, two countries pretty directly comparable context. initial claim US public healthcare would lower vaccination rates. pointed demographically politically similar country happens public health care also higher vaccination rate. specific reason say valid comparison?

And argument know small selection random people got vaccinated fear health care costs getting COVID, therefore US public healthcare rates vaccination would decrease despite happening similar countries? hear that?

What find remember entered contracts order 50 million doses AZ manufactured Melbourne. Retail workers definitely aren’t wearing masks.

Where getting from? yeah almost certainly early tested, there's reasonable chance one dodge virus, gotta establish status couple days. Exactly.

Lol… true. Kinda assumed would happen realized height pandemic last year, police people around didn’t wear masks. Hopefully people get scared roll arms.

This brutal. still seems pretty insane.

But COVID zero path guess let's see plays out.

Personally think impossible COVID become endemic, even vaccines. that's me. Good wish people like would thing. said husband anti-vaccine, heard conflicting information — including, said, doctors.

This problem mRNA, blessing &amp; also curse. new type vaccine previously hasnt use human might potentially best technology. also use ""overly concerned"" doctors/health expert spread misinformation ""untested long enough"". Cant say blame entirely, mean doctor say something otherwise listen right? misinformed people, unfortunate. 

I personally seen enough articles &amp; video ""concerned"" mRNA vaccine. professionally well made even doctors, easy common people believe misinformation. 

I glad didnt believe this, join camp ""*f\*ck need vaccine regardless type make from""*  I’ve gotten non business hours before. Congrats learning google. Except USA huge numbers people health insurance bad health insurance hospital stay would literally bankrupt them, go. FTFY.

(And yes, government supposed cover cost Covid treatments uninsured, lot people know anecdotally lot hospitals telling charging normal. Meanwhile, insurances stopped waiving co-pays deductibles.) excuse China purposely concealing happening months thought moron ""faith"". need ventilator? ""god"" going answer prayers? University make authority protect students community let students decide freely spread deadly disease, reasons. indicates third dose helps delta variant. Given schedule dosage vs Moderna, makes sense third shot would increase protection delta.

A targeted booster better information delta specifically.  vaccinated. not.  indicates third dose helps delta variant. Given schedule dosage vs Moderna, makes sense third shot would increase protection Delta.

A targeted booster better information delta specifically. Doctor's can't prescribe use something label FDA given full approval drug. Since vaccine released emergency use authorization, could given age groups EUA covering. full approval, doctors theory use vaccine ""off label"" 9 year old feel judgement would benefit it. 

Given statement American Academy Pediatrics sent FDA delaying 12 vaccine, possible pediatricians willing administer vaccine 12s full approval given. now, one? 
They want federal government provide medical care? That’s socialism, isn’t it?

I thought Alabama hated that. maybe misunderstood them. come people forgotten covid disease lingering effects possible? long covid stuff thing happen viruses bunch weird people… taking dewormer cure covid… anybody knows prayers works 🙄  can’t reason someone position didn’t reason into. Back April-May, 41% adults São Paulo antibodies infection. vaccination number 51% back (considering São Paulo almost 100% adult pop vaccinated, yeah, would different) No. didn’t. Australia. Wrong country. eggs baskets developed. eggs Pfizer ease roll out. don’t know, I’m Romania. continually trying argue point one else talking about. Cool, still getting it’s flu …… Well, hope so. embarrassing enough noticeable number people stupid save kids.  least us fall category. sells gas station sushi could read part article then, paywall popped up.
Does “full approval” mean kids 12 get it? 
I’m going make like Veruca Salt get little guy first line. Age? city live in? keep damn kid away microphone disgrace. Meanwhile got Facebook 30 days asking America, country needs assault weapons citizens unfit guns. Ridiculous assholes do.  Today got 30 day jail ban saying Taliban misogynistic. Absolute pricks. need sued poverty. Might downvoted tbh I’m tired whole discussion whether it’s safe go events anything anymore even you’re vaxxed. I’m going show (vaccinated) friends weeks, couple weeks brother going paranormal tour group 50 people. going see movies since theaters reopened. vaccinated, time I’ve wearing mask, unless I’m outside. 

I don’t understand can’t normal things vaccinated wear mask. don’t see question anymore. I’m tired stuck home getting anything everything gets cancelled people refuse help wearing mask getting vaccinated continuing spread godforsaken disease. I’m ready vaccine mandate finally move forward instead waiting people something they’ve months refuse to. true. [Vaccinated outnumber unvaccinated ICU's. like break data differently. Covid mostly get sick old people old. Age huge variable. obese, diabetes. 

The Blue unvaccinated, top one vaccinated. light green one shot. Idk, I've never perceived groceries luxury. usually comment kind posts...but goes. whole world locked properly like nz first time, movement unless necessary would variants Covid would history. government's would support populations places like USA do, bear mind cost USA month would small fraction military budget. rest world politicians courage therefore halfarsed lockdowns covid spread mutated delta lambda, continues mutate could seriously threaten humanity...lock properly pack idiots...stay home...get vaccinations, wear masks...and politicians support people balls force people.

If okay force masks force lockdown, okay force vaccines? also someone trying convince vaccine deadly old people vaccine died. Clearly nothing old age vaccine. I'm assuming anything.  you’d check Covid19 antibodies you’d probably find 95% Brazilians them. unfortunately COVID unique highly politicized. anti-vax movement brewing time seems exploded legitimized certain political actors downplayed severity virus naysay'd vaccine. historically case illnesses like smallpox polio - visibly horrible traumatizing entire generations vaccine drives eradicate/severely curb successful.

So vaccine mandate COVID viewed lens public health safety matter, rather rabidly partisan (and hostile) lens. would put money move coming federal government resulting incidents outright violence strongly people oppose vaccine. Johnson would signed 10k asked. find large amount data get NHS technical briefings. whole year. mean, big excuse people gave vaccine rushed. Given FDA good job building fact they've working overtime steps final approval still taken couple months least takes away excuse. people continue pivot, people willing change mind things. never wear mask outside again. Well, Italy went 3 cases 21 cases 90 cases 4 days back February 2020. That’s knew virus joke. Wait... NZ still Kmart? anyone translate English? indication study, instance, percentage non-hospitalized COVID sufferers cognitive defects?  asked pharmacist “even Mayo Clinic study came out” said “no”. haven’t gotten vaccine yet. Still just…trying figure out. Yea looked headline said “Honestly I’m worried” TLDR: open windows. Study modeling study only, see paper discussion here: Fuck Satan fuck Covid-19 vaccine. Christ king savior Yeah I'm curious also Yea exactly vaccine supposed work. Well that's relief, would nice get approval shooting thing body  seems point FCC needs step regulate ""fair balanced"" network's ability suggest unapproved dangerous medical treatments. first time bat issue Fox. one television channel likely contributed many thousands deaths spewing dangerous rhetoric advising use non-approved medications COVID. consider cost human lives political hoax campaign. I'm fast advocate state control press, case think exception needs made. I’m glad son.

But say vaccines work we’ll need check large data samples, individual cases.

For example: large cluster outbreaks large companies 1000 people would get infected. even assuming numbers made someone vaccinated "" 50% chance"" getting covid would assuming unvaccinated people people ""100% chance getting covid "" info need point checking vaccinations. yeah Idk people always talking great die end ICU/hospital chances already pretty slim signifncant ae group, stats actually want see collected also stats long-covid things like saying break cases, seriously impact people's lives. Long-lasting fatigue etc. 

I'm sure people talking focusing death/hospital/ICU. understand they're easily quantifiable, long-covid stuff breakthroughs worrying fuck, mostly want booster. That's entirely abnormal. 100% chance avoid death, someone's going one lucky sub 1% people.

Do know vaccine well? certain one far less effective others Delta.

If got Moderna/Phizer, know got vaccine administered correctly? Lots people got 1st shot, forgot changed mind getting 2nd shot due getting spooked side effects first shot. know people say got vaxxed, actually go whole process. worse, realize vaccines take weeks activate, go maskless immediately getting shot.

This stuff important context everything. going around vague details going word someone tough pill swallow. talking county. link study? wife teacher realize confirmed FDA knew oxycontin highly addictive painkiller still approved right? There’s probably means protection Canada like mask wearing? I'm fine saying vaccine work dad? feels almost disorienting comparing experiences others. grandpa telling covid denial stuff day ""if many people dying, know any?"" know 6 people it. 1 reinfected, 2 died. died twenties. true - it’s unbalanced though, something automatically recommend people. Oops confused symbols gamma lambda. Even studying physics... Wife got 3rd shots moderna. fluish 36 hours. Came hour 5. Wife got sick hour 14. 24 shes fluish like was. 1 2 fine. 2 got high fevers. fevers 3 either us one nation world 60% Pfizer.

Most 30% unvaccinated, 20% AZ, 10% J&amp;J less 50% Pfizer &amp; Moderna. love religion conspiracies. Alabama Europe. true. situation entirely preventable. still 60% chance getting covid vaccinated number expected go time. 
People covid beat naturally 0% chance getting again, therefore, 0% chance spreading it. people need get vaccine? Well, US 2 borders. probably could pressured canada copy US rules. 

So would one border. media government loves talk shit vaccines. numbers paint clear pictures: vaccine works wonders. problem due various reasons, way many unvaccinated people. goal getting EVERYONE vaccinated. stories vaccinated people hospitalized break infections really disheartening. Yeah, like odds better vaccinated unvaccinated, like much couple months ago. &amp; seeing military members looked property US government forced comply. Hopefully preventable. Whew, glad (hopefully) getting approved. Would real interesting one did, schools/workplace required specific companies vaccine another weeks delivery actually come *with* pizza well. Please people get vaccinated resort strippergrams. Nah, loosening restrictions.

Predictably, cases hospitalisations go again.

They'll probably nothing substance ICUs full again. Vaccines seatbelts, protect impact, don’t prevent impacts, that’s masks, washing hands social distance for.

The marketing around vaccines gateway freedom heavily backfire, lot harder get people back board next season. population died look like? probably mostly older people right? among *that* population, percentage vaccinated? Raw statistics like tell us nothing. 100% population vaccinated 100% hospitalizations death would vaccinated. mean vaccine effective. painting incomplete picture. I've since learned called [base rate need vaccine-laced mosquitos end shit all. happens media mindfucks people *distrust* creating faux conflicts capitalistic gain. Great idea trav starve bankrupt people want vaccine! Good thing thing called burglary exists need mask! drop pride tell Trump we'll pay $100 every one new Republican gets vaccine. covid pill? Covidiots under. old? Damn that’s terrible. Otherwise healthy? r/iamverybadass agree everything said also realize vaccine stop spread others reason mandated hilarious reply, totally appreciated. FDA Says Neigh Horse Cure.  Thanks, I’ve read smell training. I’ve trying buff aftershave couple times day lol. It’s usually pretty strong.

Supposing suppository might work 
Oohh deeper johnny deeper Please get vaccinated. I’m teen want future. Delta variant brought return practice well-honed pandemic: waiting.

The unvaccinated unmasked covid deniers brought return waiting.  exactly call Covid *preventable* 100% agree blame lays feet numerous anti-vax ideology loving idiots currently office airwaves.

If ever time truly censor people negative impact society time now. exactly problem. someone bribe trump come support vaccine. would pay itself. Bill gates, listening?   root word vaccine comes latin word cow. (because cowpox used innoculate smallpox). blindly trust government? 

/s Yeah thankfully I've never harassed it. Thankfully I've always lived areas trump flags signs, people care enough now. I've heard Huntsville described northern colony, might help. Either way, wish best luck! Hopefully get act together need lockdown big ol mandates. Days earlier, however, family returned Greek vacation central city Modiin, middle class commuter hub Tel Aviv Jerusalem. 90 percent residents 12 vaccinated, according mayor, Haim Bibas, making one Israel’s vaccinated cities.

But family included child young vaccinated, spent least 10 days home quarantine pending negative PCR test, according regulations time.

Instead, parents sent child school. Ultimately, 80 students infected Delta variant.



We held unvaccinated kids going school reason. Someone work said there's way know person would fine either way. said person got vaccine minor symptoms there's way know they'd worse symptoms without it.

Didn't really know say that. Meanwhile, /r/conservatives they’re talking full FDA approval Pfizer means nothing except confirms corruption FDA also want know vaccine efficacy Delta vs vaccine received.

I keep seeing Pfizer 40s-70s% range protection Delta. talks boosters. Data including people got shots many months ago.

Does anyone know effective 2nd dose Pfizer (2weeks after) protecting Delta infection?

Japan slow I'm scheduled get 2nd shot days. I'm hoping I'll get least enjoy months high safety I'm taking crowded trains to/from work.  forget Central TN, we're probably 1-2 weeks max completely F'd. appreciate comment understand coming from. 

Plus, young uni. That's one thing feel lucky, got enjoy years youth. imagine hard must people age lose previous time (sorry rub salt wound). can't say age. going absolutely convince MAGAots using it, world, actual scientific authority doctors ALWAYS lie them.  

I vote let kill off. Completely agree you. Also need numbers given incidence rates (that is, per 100,000 whatever number want) well age range possible. 

I believe Israel released current stats show, account confounding variables like age, vaccines highly protective death serious illness. say that?  Anti-vax: virus 99.999 percent survival rate, don’t need vaccine.

A review nasal sprays gargles antiviral properties suggests number commonly used antiseptics including povidone-iodine, Listerine®, iota-carrageenan chlorhexidine studied clinical trials mitigate progression transmission SARS-CoV-2.

Nope  feel families, innocent bystanders, we’re really losing best here. perhaps lemmings need lose move on. Here's one secret fighting covid government want know about...


With lack public health advocacy Southeast USA, painfully accurate target reverse psychology hack.

Btw I’m pro vax take covid seriously facts matter ways. Sounds good. guess illegalize abortion. body choice irrelevant sake civic duties people extend unborn. College fucking expensive nothing value lost.   Happily married socially responsible person, wasn't, would absolutely deal breaker.
Not vaccinated tells 3 things you:


1) arrogant enough think know experts

2) stupid enough fall facebook conspiracies

3) selfish enough care getting others around sick, want part end pandemic


Obviously legitimate health reasons aside, refusing free vaccine, many people world would KILL access to, someone I'm interested spending time with.  already security lines get stadium get bag searched stuff, expect it’ll part screening process. Lollapalooza seems proven it’s possible make work. real worry partying after. always need /s days hear coming from, though. Anyone two working brain cells rub together saw happening April India Delta, knew would coming Europe US soon. Now, July, started domestic Delta outbreaks. two months enough reformulate mRNA vaccine, produce, distribute domestically, even scenario treated like flu vaccine year operates new strains (i.e. skip clinical trials)? know, going guess that's perhaps going realistic, ever? Hopefully wrong that.

It's suggested SARS2 experiencing convergent evolution, hopeful given well Wuhan-strain vaccine works Delta still, Delta-strain vaccine might work even better future Greek letters alphabet, long find way keep antibody titers up. latter may practical/feasible, investigating nasal-spray style vaccines protect via mucousa may end future (people working this). reason hopeful; think might timeline people hoping for...which life. Republicans, anti maskers, anti-vaxxers. preference. Didn’t UK take “fuck it” approach decide fully open everything though?  distanced everyone get vaccine spreading conspiracies honestly can't conversation without stress level going though roof worth it. 

I also distanced although lambda variant first vaccine resistant variant covid-19 seems troubling highly doubt last vaccine resistant variant.  However... 1 4 Doctors... 97% already vaccinated Covid. mean CNA's, Home Health Workers etc... doctors.

People getting confused take medical advice from. person comes house help get dressed, run errands fix meals even remind take meds(no matter vital care) doctor. 

You walk hospital see neurologist, oncologist, cardiologist, primary care physician even dentist vaccinated. say stuff like 1 4 healthcare providers mean doctors. Could candy striper.... I've actually thought before. imagining like 6 years now, I'm lunch coworker something, offhandedly mention never worried covid never followed restrictions whatever. able respect them. believe recent research suggests it’s permanent brain tissue loss, temporary kids back school? think going bad then? see. hospital ER 110% capacity. 80%of beds used unvaccinated. could big problem. 

People cant get hospital start die. sick covid.

That tip iceberg. Cuz I'm sure everyone's heard Bible verse JohnsonJohnson 3:17 though shalt free thy masketh loveth thy old neighbor. 

My God, religion gotten low touch know Bible actually tells kind help people protect around instead hiding behind religion order push self interests. want asshole that's okay hide behind religion order enough balls asshole outright stop giving religion terrible name already bad enough. think least they'd mask mandate. mean look them, clothing pretty much built cloth mask. would vaccine restore anything? healing potion... yell it. typed it. also recognize fully vaccinated (2 doses mrna vaccine) case ""breakthrough"", right?

what percentage college students US fully vaxxed? *most* states, well half. many probably 20% couldn’t they? stadium business place, it’s like local laws regulations vanish. That’d like saying don’t need wear mask grocery store live another state. They’re free turn people away. Damn dumbass people Mississippi. confusing 'providers' 'employees'. Janitors, cafeteria workers, supply dock workers providers still work healthcare Can’t fix stupid. point treating people crowd hospitals prevent others getting treatment violate Hippocratic oath? brain tissue shrinking likely temporary, thank god  good news people extremely willing get vaccinated (BTW, got second shot today). fact, nearly every adult city São Paulo (Brazil's largest city) received first shot they're starting vaccinate teens co-morbidities.

The bad news Delta already arrived here. Even though Gamma remains dominant variant nationwide, Delta estimated common variant Rio de Janeiro state. Perfect example great vaccine performance! Glad feeling better thanks posting. Except manufacturing capacity fixed. Canada opening another plant Moderna vaccine production soon. That's one example manufacturing capacity expanding real time. supposed upset this? Test get here, vaccinate all, quarantine ones test positive. like virus already running rampant America. golden state warriors recently announced people must provide proof vaccination attend games. assume rest sports base California follow suit.  excess deaths year? son got Covid last week, although fully vaccinated, symptoms mild (sore throat, aches headache). He's young, healthy vaccine kept needing hospitalization. Many daughters' friends fully vaccinated also got Covid symptoms mild. alegro de que esté mejorando por ahí.

Aquí yo conozco directamente ningún fallecido por covid, aunque bastantes amigos conocidos sí han perdido familiares, en general bastante ancianos. Los casos de covid que conozco han requerido hospitalización, los activos ahora ente los vacunados están siendo muy muy leves, incluso una totalmente asintomática.

Cuídese, espero que llegue allí ninguna variante más sigan mejorando. remember Penn Tellers Bullshit, guy go around explaining dangers dihydrogen monoxide got way many people sign form requesting banned.  Remember article vaccine durability effectiveness per se, says HPV vaccine could outlier studies durability remains stable would needed(plus HPV vaccine relatively new)...which I'm saying know get covid control, stands vaccines best tools so,I wish we(as humans) make contentious issues everything, actually discuss things. Articles like one shared remind end day malice Ill intent constantly put forward antivaxx groups. two examples, University Oregon University Washington allowing remote flex work every staff member including faculty pre-outbreak shift remote needed. Duke also offering remote work regular student Covid tests addition standard stuff.  many calls get?

They said ""potential exposure"", people know taking *at all*? That's crazy. calling info took it? 8 months? Israel 5 months getting good results. That’s F idiotic statement! Breakthroughs joke, narrative really mild basis fact.

The best data this, though break fully age bracket. Over-50 fully vaccinated Delta CFR 1.8%, overall breakthrough CFR 0.85%. UK's overall 0.17% CFR driven tremendous number unvaccinated cases really young people 0.03% CFR.

Even given that, find 20% symptomatic rate 6 weeks Alpha pretty shocking.  two birds one stone UVa: (1) protect student body unvaccinated, (2) protect reputation sending dumbasses degree name it. Multiple people responded reasons someone situation would benefit vaccine contribute overall goal limiting spread covid. obviously genuinely want answers, seeking argument confirm already established beliefs. 

Maybe mention reason doctor advised get vaccinated. obese, high BP, type 2 diabetes, I'm screwed anyway. going back normal many us comorbidities. Even vaccinated, I'll lucky survive this. CDC article reinforces point. family canceled upcoming cruise October one next May, really what's point.  Spoiler: long term health issues. Researchers convinced loss taste smell result damaged loss brain tissue. brother dumber today got covid. year 2525, man still alive,   
If woman survive ... People tolerate rampant stupidity long quit caring. Especially widespread now. literally North Idaho State Fair happening weekend less 30 minutes away this. 

As local, say us imbeciles. many. 

I work Idaho I'm still person work wears mask now. Grateful WA reinstated mask mandate envy retail people forced enforce it. uh duh Maybe area live in. grandparents boil water advisories 3 times past year. Shedding vaccine? must read Aunt Jannie’s post FB Good  Dead Covid unvaccinated leaving 3 young children widow -check  start? Like said take horse pill lol mother this... condone simple walking getting another one. *have to* say that. swore kind evil oath medical school! got lucky. There's plenty dead people people long term health issues thought fine lived healthy lifestyle. Six weeks still pretty long time “mild” breakthrough “just another disease society needs suck deal with”

Colds flus generally last like 1-3 weeks don’t leave lingering symptoms 6 week mark. definitely one reason don’t want us become callous notion people get COVID long don’t end hospital it’s good. Probably good number **3000 people** covid, yes, including US military personnel aircraft crew. Can't leave behind right? Get quarantine 14 days needed.

Most people know vax equal certain death. That's dont get vaccinated. Come on, headache sore throat. You’re hospital. Talk tone deaf post. vaccines prevent severe prolonged infections. see longest severe infections immunocompromised. diversity viral genome people highest. diversity virus vaccinated people much know agreeing right?

There's certainly good rationale hesitant comes kids, I'm burnt seeing parents clinic bring kids sick visit, refusing get vaccinated themselves; tired county state leaders requiring masks schools. isn’t discussed enough.

I agree. I'm vaccinated people know. know SIX people who've already vaccinated least months Pfizer (same flavor got) contracted COVID last month half...but *probably* Delta variant.

Here point, though: local health authorities (this Oregon) press SIX people get tested, told assume COVID quarantine 11 days whatever. Three insisted getting tested came back positive. 3 ""count"". **The three show anywhere, numbers-wise, never got tested.**

I spoke Contact Tracing one infected given name potential-exposure. hearing vaccinated, person end line kind blew idea getting test got symptoms (which never did) pressed eventually said contacted directly getting symptoms, they'd arrange one me.

FWIW. IMO, there's bullshit going seems like State might want keep fully vaccinated but-later-infected folks ""off books"" much possible.

**EDIT:** Five six Pfizer, sixth Moderna Even depressing still racking donations. actually read studies, I’ll concede bring couple valid counters, best counters might bring exactly effective masks are. counters don’t invalidate studies.

MK Ultra

The USG purposefully killed black people syphilis.

Gulf Tonkin

Operation Northwoods need slow virus down. Masks help slow transmission vaccines help keep people dying get it. combination get develop treatments get better vaccines. 

It’s saving lives keeping healthcare system overwhelmed. I've yet see article mentioning people vaccinated go grocery store buy food.

All articles (including one thread) talk restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas on. Nothing truly necessary. maximum level locking much infastructure testing, city million people using contact tracing well tracker app best monitor spread. worked Delta different beast entirely. Exactly strategy here. focusing building wealth last 18 months chaos unfolds around me.

Almost amusing fact clusterfuck. enough since ordered late. You’re asserting one third one half vaccinated people develop COVID die? That’s really good news. Brazil getting hammered much epidemic. Melbourne absolute riots today... announced everyone going in-home locked up, police going go door door taking children home (25,000 children time) escorting stadium mandated vaccine. government ensured children looked closely entire event, children returned homes jab.

This messed up, anyone supports sick.   paywall ... article say oh wow ill take sure now. hip hip hooray I(30) got covid December mild cold week lost smell taste months. housemate(25) never symptoms worked normal. Neither us vaccinated. 3 4 friends(38,31,27) fully vaccinated gotten covid post vaccination bed week flu like symptoms city us attending similar events/venues. I’m scientist approval vaccine doesn’t seem much considering they’re side effects despite unlikely can’t trust word someone else I’ve seen myself. makes sense. Thanks explaining that. Instead save effective vaccine people taking random deworming drugs. 
Im speechless. I'm Canada, BC. basically test people get hospitalized. What's hard data again? instance would person told vaccinated he/she liability? I've heard one before. raises concerns. Specifically, vaccines dangerous? people filing suit doctors? would person described liability regards vaccinated? before/after study, after?

Does study show decrease cognitive ability post Covid antivaxxers generally dumber everybody else? heck wrong news reporters? really brain dead? Imagine beginning this, religious leaders urged flock stay home, socially distance, mask, etc. Imagine kept every week. vaccine comes out, urged followers every week go get shots. meantime, keep distancing masking, etc. 

That would powerful! It’s “trusted member community” thing really changes minds. I’m church goer, know lot put lot weight said pulpit. 

Instead got evil callous disregard neighbors. know plenty religious leaders take right road (including parents’) whole lot didn’t. Huge wasted opportunity. also wrong, UK R rate hit 2.0 last October. I’m hopeful booster shots bolster immunity. Israel great data coming benefits booster shot especially 6+months since second dose. Doesnt even work anymore Around 90% adults UK vaccinated... 60% population think Canada's choice extend interval doses

I thought case too. latest paper UK says increase interval first second doses matter. increase efficacy longer interval. even say ""that used successfully around world"". modos vaccinated bit getting people frenzy. sociopaths. balance think overestimating efficacy Delta.

I'm literally comparing per-capita infection rates Canada. data get harder that. transport

Depends public transport. travelled bullet train (TGV) weekend. pass needed associated ticket enter platform.

Long distance requires pass already. far metropolitan area transportation require valid pass.

If 90 percent population vaccinated cases vaccinated population almost everyone vaccinated opposed unvaccinated. It’s actual case numbers matter percentages. However since like percentages I’ll give following example. 

You total 1000 people little country. call idiotville. 

900 vaccinated 100 unvaccinated.

Over course one month 50 infections resulting hospitalization. 

Of 50 infections, 30 vaccinated breakthroughs 20 unvaccinated.

Percentage wise translates to: 

20 percent unvaccinated population hospitalized

3 percent vaccinated population hospitalized

In example vaccinated people end hospital unvaccinated it’s meaningless considering people unvaccinated.

Understandable keeps message simple (""get vaccinated"") avoids confusion around infected unfortunate since people (the previously infected) appear relatively safe virus vaccine unnecessary least year, single shot would significantly boost immunity. thing is, lot experts, like Christian Drosten, saying herd immunity absolutely unachievable. way IMHO vaccinating everyone risk groups.

IDEA - Someone make list online list doctors know fit one avoid possible. Nah anti vaxxers find study loop back edit this, remember, vaccines much higher efficacy natural immunity, moreso 80% range (and believe lower, like 60% range elderly). Whereas vaccines end 90%+.

I think reasoning was, forgive completely memory, vaccines better chance presenting full spike protein profile immune systems infected, might triggering partial detection another component virus less consistent.  ""Oh, way, popular content three months pack medical lies probably killed thousands people."" Romanians work still think corona political lie destroy economy.

I said would government want destroy economy.

But can't fix stupid.  Sad story. getting them, contracted covid, still would rejected vaccine. 

It's sad comes experience something someone's light bulb switch on. understand kids get vaccinated. 

These people make angry, sad. want die, there's getting them. CDC (which part HHS, acting behest White House) eased mask guidelines part social engineering misguided attempt encourage vaccination.

Overall, 1.8% tested positive. **At ages, odds testing positive higher last vaccine dose received least 146 days earlier**, research team reported Thursday medRxiv ahead peer review. Among patients older 60, odds positive test almost three times higher least 146 days passed since second dose. new infections observed recently, said coauthor Dr. Eugene Merzon Leumit Health Services Israel.

And even high protection infection, 100%. put risky situations likely get infection. still high enough able mostly resume regular activities confidence, maybe wear mask crowded trains still give little bit added protection and/or reduce transmission others end it. hell still uses FB? Honestly place super uneducated spew bs? say someone friggin reddit. meant rather flippant response defense cardiac patients persuasive argument vaccination, still raise valid points. dunno, live Ontario I've double vaxxed since May, still wear masks everywhere. really big deal compliance always been.

Maybe blessing disguise us get vaccines later states, think clearly bad idea tell everyone didnt wear masks vaccinated, way tell apart unvaccinated. 54  purchase, school purchase, high qualify HEPA air purifier? run $150? Run two room full blast?  Paralympics starting days too. think saying protective benefit increase covid unvaccinated, total protectiveness. 

In words, thing like going 0% 60% increased benefit going 85% 90%. Meanwhile free vaccine available Scientists many answers silver bullet father fully vaccinated February Moderna.

Should pushing see doctor ask get booster? 67, 50lbs overweight, recently diagnosed diabetic (however refuses treatment), suspect maybe early Parkinson’s. keeps saying wait it’s turn get one. states exemptions though? tons kids public school unvaccinated. That's gay $3 bill

-my brother-in-law china's vaccine significantly less effective 3 mainly given coercive mechanism know thisll hard democracy answer real world political considerations voters whatever want. US cant go give billion doses lol. India developing country 2nd populous country perfectly well developed many major metro areas. still got ravaged Delta worse Honestly, yes. Covid is. need start saying agree vaccination makes sense. argument terribly flawed based outdated information. need better advocating vaccine going convince people vaccinate. 

It's 15 minutes. one dose, 2-3 week pause, second dose another 2-week pause. least month full vaccination. also ignoring 1-3 days temporary side effects vaccine recipients mostly staying bed. better compare downtime moderate COVID cases, people something worse flu hospitalized two weeks. 

It's totally free. paying insurance taxes. insurance paid vaccine, also paying taxes cover shots uninsured people lied identity get third shot. better compare indirect cost shot direct cost hospital stay counter medicines treating extreme flu-like symptoms moderate case. 

It's equivalent compare vaccine something prevents heart attacks. vaccine largely prevents hospitalization COVID, vaccinated people catch spread COVID. example vaccine prevents hospitalization heart attacks, acknowledges heart attacks still happen. 

Thank hearing this. low hanging fruit unvaccinated people convinced original statement, need use different technique next round. still found good technique people think real. suggestions appreciated. Agreed, can't -- support far one Israeli study keep talking about, 20% vaxxed people get long covid. 

However, many people subreddit even others keep parroting ""if vaxxed, nothing worry [regarding long covid]."" There's equal amount missing evidence well (except one study UK showing 50% reduction chance long covid vaxxed).

Also, point comment replied much long covid; using Israeli study calculate risk infection right US different strain, different vaccine efficacy, different community level spread, treating average American Israeli nurse. awesome news!! vaccine passport, contact tracing app, like said. scan code register store, outbreak happens, health officials able contact let know may put risk exposure. Merck telling people inject drug wish full speedy recovery. Last year said symptoms young kids way milder. still true Delta variant? news hospitalization kids... county in? I’ve seen number local health care systems publishing graphics show census information vaccinated unvaccinated individuals daily. bid increase vaccination uptake local communities area low vaccination uptake. biggest church McCormick county SC this, much bigger vaccination rate one would expect rural South Carolina county clarification, I'm Canadian time shots varries provinces. Ontario prior June wait four months shots. Starting late June wait 28 days second Moderna 21 days phizer. Quebec wait time 8 weeks 4weeks. know rest country two provinces represent majority Canada. initial thought wait months give majority population least one dose limited supply getting. supplies grew goal get people fully vaccinated September. Daily cases among top 5 well deaths rise regarding US case counts?

Define ""anytime soon."" peaking end October count ""anytime soon?"" could matter means people received second dose recently, therefore less time efficacy wane. CT gave update last week 26% hospitalizations fully vaccinated. honestly surprised high states seemed 5% range. hospitalized, 14% ICU fully vaccinated. Stay vigilant think Australia get vaccinated, still supply issues still least another month US summer heat fall starts. well could see cases peak drop next 30 days.

And would make feel even disappointing surge back October like last year… Everyone. America.  states clearly are/have okay response biggest loss civil liberties recent history protests seem quiet tame pray generations old fued Cuba keep us lending support Cuban people now.  Eh, yeah, also would imagine vast majority people get properly sick vaccinated get tested.

Not say asymptomatic cases don’t matter, terms catching breakthrough cases people actually sick feeling symptoms (which vaccinated person care about) it’s probably pretty accurate. work ER seen one vaccinated person needed oxygen. former smoker needed 4L 10th day. They'll crawling out, playing pinochle snout! Capitalism says no. Another predictable chapter past 1.5 years. wandering really strange places obtuse discuss things with. 

If one conversation specific doctor specific patient example something deeply serious. It’s anecdote. vote! Australians gone completely nuts! Three doses better Delta variant two. Delta produces absolute buttload viral particles, it’s breaking more, one layer trick. Virginia's health department used time slider could see stats time frame wanted. ... removed it. Awesome.  That's still me, dawg. I’m sorry you’re sick hope mild better soon. ""compassion fatigue."" (see link below) 

At beginning pandemic felt scared family, also extremely sad caught it...especially died, families.

Now, feel sad families. know feel way withdrawn sympathy antivaxxers antimaskers. Think this: someone, let's call Person A, inadvertently passed Delta many others, one may someone's child, one child got really sick died.

Let reemphasize this: one child, least ONE child, MAY died Person A's selfish anti-vax / anti-mask decision. use dwindling amount compassion toward Person A? 

I'm not.

I'm holding onto giving families, kids, got sick reason fiancee's uncle literally goes vet instead doctor. tell more? covid last year time left hospital could barely walk. 3 months even get bed 1.5 years later Im still stuck home using walker. 

Several doc visits neurologist blood tests doctor straight said idea wrong me. One neuro appointment showed positive peripheral neuropath. Though usually shows hands feet tingling burning. entire freaking body pretty much neck painful. skin tingles feels numb like fell asleep, meanwhile muscles ache sometimes even spasm. 

Sorry vent Im scared. lost job, dont think get another. Hell painful exercise walk w/ walker car drive hospital visits, even need talk park car wheel chair. can't go shopping. Thank God Walmart home delivery else would seriously deep crap. use walker+ cage wheel thing bought put bags pull 10 feet kitchen.

My quality life absolute shit mental state crashing since losing job. Delta way contagious Could also stress grief losing mom brother… years theme: London, 1665 actively hates audience, knows lies realize he's one wealthy elites hate. attempted control taking lots demographic variables using model demographic variables tends predict cognitive performance studies. found people predicted higher cognitive performance also higher chance covid.

It's possible control really capture pre-Covid cognitive performance researchers least attempted test hypothesis putting forward. Or, doctors intelligent work patients, get Covid way. people infected roommates family members…or people children school daycare. reason people like shit Canada US reason Romania “donating” doses population anti-vaccination. “Donating” rich country like South Korea ridiculous it’s clear there’s ulterior motive/interest here. true. wish people stopped regurgitating shit. fact knew people vaccine hesitant, strongly anti mask.

Schools also open places. depends month talking Great labour isnt cheap

Cheap labour isnt great. obviously haven’t watch King Hill episode renaissance fair. sounds miserable own, Im gonna continue travel stuff Yet Governor illegal schools mandate masks. smart Good thing never worry people real world, they'll inside next 10 years. office less productive working home, know 'wfh perfect!' answers rise top that's everyone wants do, reality much complicated team dynamics room together can't replicated. people pretty much guaranteed get it. Delta r5. Even vaccines stop 50%, everyone get's spread 5 people. 90% people vaccinated, still has, overall, 

They buying idea helps stay hospital. way communicated. Two vaccinated people pass covid other. pass child can’t get vaccinated.

To think voluntarily going extremely crowded place children filling hospitals record numbers can’t get vaccinated extremely selfish. People use mental gymnastics justify actions, I’m sure helps sleep night. don’t disagree long run, think people celebrating remote work becoming norm aren’t thinking enough long term ramification. job done computer outsourced countries world people ramping skills needed.  Reminder: it’s office, it’s commute, people 2 months homework last year holy hell miss it. productive, less stressed .... please let go back. :( Right? time applied management role get away *really* shitty manager. 

I desperate. Lol  Tye chance kid dying symptoms seems unchanged. Delta school reopenings infecting many many kids. Even mortality rate low, noting long term symptoms well, enough kids get fill pediatric ICUs huge problem. know mumbers accurate CDC exaggerated numbers earlier month? t’s pretty tough meet people new city working home, especially consider in-office interactions, happy hours, etc. would normally happen.

Repeat me: coworkers friends.

This exactly type BS productive people want avoid staying home. super glad spend quarter day bothered anymore. Great, work good rearranging chairs decks Titanic. There’s people like that?

I honestly thought mask quality settled March 2020. I'm guessing bosses worried ones worried others going figure useless unnecessary bosses really are. Good. less productive office, frankly, half team would turned still office. I've working home year want go back. find many distractions home harder sometime seperate work life home life. Plus kind miss commute sometimes. know that's little weird like gave alone time car could listen music podcast sort prepare day also unwind work.   whiteboard sessions, complementary/ better apps Zoom, Teams Slack. Check Miro, among others. sensationalist. folks going back.

That said, maybe something like 4 day workweek becomes feasible enticing way bring people back. I’ll quit I’m ever ‘obligated’ go work every day again. Everything ’remote work’ LOL Yeah that's old Testament stuff, know Jesus got rid old laws came follow unless want to. 🤪 Ya real. work content team cosmetics company, manager charge organizing tasks focus actually them. There's much requests coming lot different people would mess someone who's job sort throught that. I'm pretty sure boss wants work home since team photo stuff we're one ones needs site job. would they? There's lots drugs toxic purpose, particularly immune stuff, like cancer. That's ""it's FDA approved"" good enough reason take something read online might help. hometown vaccination rate 28%. local facebook groups overran misinformation   boss, would chill, commercial property owner, would sweating bullets. It’s already happened. Doesn’t phase me.  really difficult get perfect estimate accurate vaccines since can't randomized control trial. 50-80% covers range studies effectiveness. got 50 pack kn95 Amazon $20. use higher risk place (airport, movie theatre) stick cloth masks regular lower risk activities. children can’t get vaccinated would much rather people vaxxed wear masks there.  curious see compared rest country period.
For continue say Florida fine. first COVID shot, didn’t even feel it.  glanced away something preparing nurse jabbed me. looked afterwards asked going it.  

The second shot made point watch happen, again, honestly didn’t actually see needle go arm, wouldn’t believed got it. feel flu shots normal ones, COVID shots time delivery insignificant. disagreeing exactly, want add bit context. beginning year currently, covid killed 163 kids less 18, flu killed 9 \- filtering data get right date range). Since 2004, flu deaths children ranged 37 199. Covid deaths year alone comparable pretty bad flu season children. back pretty good masking/distancing/etc. kids largely virtual learning. also delta variant came along. Considering current surge vaccination rates still pretty low among children (Currently 32.6% 12-15 43% 16-17, I'd say plenty reason concerned Covid children move schools opening in-person learning (many without masks). 

Also hospitalizations covid among 0-17 years already peaks January well January peaks certain parts country (e.g., southeast). Ireland seeing many breakthrough cases? Matcha tea also virus replication-prevention effect helps inflammation well... might actually better using IVM? Shortly, afternoon. They’re really take period piece cosplay seriously. didn’t even improve unemployment numbers.

Lol. way. Huh? Fucking why??? see reason virus continue mutate, there's already lambda virus mutation. Thanks! Sentiment slowly changing here. It’s interesting watch say least job trying shoehorn us back office fit half us fast possible. gave one two buildings supposed moving new bigger building currently construction. construction got delayed pandemic didn’t want renew lease. 

Instead us continue WFH, devised complicated desk-sharing arrangement/schedule. Team leaders 3 days week regular associates 2 days. still can’t in-person meetings maintain social distancing, even office together still video meetings people 3 cubicles away. Also, state high covid rates keep push back return date month time. 

But know proletariat already resisting returning beige walled prisons. know longer let us wfh harder get us back. Little realize isn’t person department isn’t looking fully remote job right now. Perhaps size dump truck rock quarry… especially expected dress roles client-facing.

I dont understand guys get work done slacks every day even loosest pair slacks makes feel like junk smashed suffocating. Yes, perhaps missed other’s points. read original response “That’s stupid, millions kids aren’t going die! focusing this, lol?” turn, replied maybe look pass death rates consideration warning factors. responded original poster wrong (which argue, wasn’t point comment.) etc.  Looks like Shapiro really going places life. vaccines less year. enough time passed able answer questions. fact evidence sufficient assuage concerns yet. 

There enough information following questions:

* repeated exposure affect immunogenic response LNPs?
* likelihood ribisomal production proteins desired modified spike protein?
* might differences modified spike protein “real” spike protein contribute differences immunologic response?
* might vaccine mRNA interact LINE-1 processes?

I find deeply concerning kind questioning seen based pseudo-religious dogma deserving label “idiocy” rather legitimate, thoughtful, informed scientific skeptical inquiry. Gotcha, I'm fine. Thanks clarifying. county “is considered ‘substantial transmission’” virus, cases nearby counties Ashe, Wilkes Burke, “high transmission” counts COVID-19, Brantz wrote declaration.

Lol one wants spend 8 hours office cubicle commuting 2 hours every day. work done room wearing nothing underwear. could literally spend months inside leave home. outside world offer anyway? Children, especially 12 (the ones can't get vaccines), little ability go parents. Let's say 7 year old wants wear mask school scared getting sick. parents believe masks. Okay, 7 year old change this? money 7. Even money buy mask keep away parents ultimate rights everything life? 7 year old's real hope adult older teen conspirator, given. sound paranoid KN95? might want double mask KN95.

Anyway. pharma industry making tens tens billions. everyone thinks they’re “good guys” now. It’s laughable  defense outreach operation political outreach experience relevant here.

But still, still think bad move. optics always bad something like adding another degree difficulty. Even assuming cronyism played part, fact people smart enough consider optics good.

But come on, politics, course cronyism played part. Hopefully there's investigation BS. made mandatory school attendance.

I would strongly support this, much would strongly support requiring measles vaccine school attendance (obviously exemptions appropriate).

Every child goes school, strong intermix kinds children kinds families. children cannot vaccinated due medical condition. parents extended family children severe risk catch covid.

It makes sense require child contribute herd immunity school they're able to, others cannot contribute valid reasons also protected. sudden worried kids covid? thought least risk? covid bad kids old people, would already let kids get vaccine. Maybe some, plenty advantages people work location many industries. Sure sales web coder need hardware work wherever, work eaxmple programmer embedded device(s) way beneficial everyone work office hardware testers live. Yeah, honestly, virus it’s way resistant everything anyways. I’ve seen collages social media posts number people trusting vaccine last administration, first line available them. ""91% adults partially vaccinated.

135,000 12-15-year-olds registered Covid jab, 77,000 doses administered cohort.""

Great progress! Fuck going office shit. remote since 1999. waste time driving office nowdays? CEO's taken note...take line item balance sheet. need small brick mortar prescense occasional in-person meetings. Employees happier productive without hassle downtime drive office. two cents. Got force peons back work… started development program company. work home moment due pandemic. interest going back office one week. also makes sense considering position I'm developed work home position. also flexibility staying currently live instead relocating market double rent. finance engineering teams work India US time. make adjustments needed. effect Delta. seems pretty effective serious symptoms death (important good!). seems somewhat effective infected, depending variety factors like age, time since vaccination, type vaccine. infected, may little effect spreading virus others shedding period start infection, obviously issue traveling spending time near others. 

It's valuable safety measure, panacea.  job going outsourced nothing stop that. matter much show office long. Provincetown study said 74% -- 346 cases -- fully vaccinated. cases, 79% reported symptoms.  would reasonable amount money. people rocking cloth disposables though, N95s.  shit scares me. I'll continue cautious. job forcing us back office time soon, I'm good position. sucks know others going suffer carelessness thoughtlessness others. [P.32 CDC report - ~200 hospitalizations per firmly believe

Why feel need say this? scientific all. entire point science say ""believe"". Zero COVID completely unfeasible, bonkers target face Delta population next zero immunity/antibodies. Always really.

Now Kiwis jump 'it's zero COVID strategy, zero COVID sufficient level vaccination', yes fine - Delta sheer infectiousness, shortened period transmission higher potential breakthrough vaccines NZ ordered. minister seems get that, keeping borders closed everyone hotel quarantine time fly shutting word simply sustainable virus endemic. 

I know lot driven shortage ICU beds country, strategy also unfortunate effect reducing urgency build capacity, leaving potential timeline even protected. reservations every country Australia HK - exit strategy seems massively flawed something like UK UAE seems altogether practical. Live lower levels virus long healthcare system preparedness vaccines widely available. Call delivery vaccine? Sounds like opportunity prank antivaxxers variability disease behavior, that's true statement. best thing vaccinate reduce spread need highly effective highly vaccinated population achieve that. people actually eligible get vaccine actually got it... Pretty sure individuals actively moving goal posts. variants getting way.. One little tapeworm, monsieur, wafer thin. Yeah. feel like similar Canada UK strategy extended time doses despite different manufacturers' specifications. 

We're trying make best calls cards have. know I'll ginger ale soup ready get third jab November December. somewhat understandable, people realize there's convincing idiots?

Stop trying ""reach across aisle"" people work you, stop trying help *refuse* help.

There's plenty people left US rest world *want* help focusing No, can't. European countries fully vaccinated people Israel Malta, Iceland, San Marino (three small nations fill criteria put), Belgium, Spain, Denmark, Ireland Portugal.

So let get straight - listening CDC fault? listening scientists metric trying reach year? also love attention little tantrums get them. absolutely people moving goal posts. everyone eligible vaccinated got vaccinated, would see many break cases amount covid cases hospitals. one moving goal posts? Seriously. completely power US citizens. 70% Americans 20 overweight, 50% obese. Many diabetes, asthma, sedimentary lifestyles etc.

Lets say worst case scenario long covid breakthrough vaccines rate non-vaccinated. long think sheltering place? months talking years. Thank responding me. exactly implying think it’s likely reason.

And CDC idiots think new variant would rise. already went two waves think *possibility* third would run through? Especially dozens countries without access vaccine?

But no, let's say everyone vaccinated throw away masks. They've bumbled messaging often I'm surprised get right wrong. prioritised

No country prioritised. producers distributing vaccines based contracts, based needs most. No, weren’t Giddy Good making sacrifice something love. many others steadfastly refused give far less that, expense everyone else. make sense though. First get go knew vaccine studies done cases noticable symptoms, claim vaccine prevented covid basis really.

But even data suggest vaccines reduce severity. That's good reason anyway. True, feel safe visiting Florida right even vaccinated person. there's way knowing situation year - - delta could burn quickly could exact spot another variant clueless governor unvaxed population. trip year out, long ready accept level risk safety requirements, would keep Florida plans ready change needed going 2022. Probably people going think far ahead consider effects strongly death.

We're still get everyone vaccinated phase. mean, scientists admit break cases happen, think necessarily predict much population takes vaccine effective potentially deadly variants pop proper research done. think vaccine still extremely effective variants, way want be. perfect, going prevent everyone getting symptoms get covid. prevented bed ridden worse, that's great. read morning Must Named (been using years lol) encouraged people get vaccinated rally weekend, people losing ever loving minds. do? believe?

We covid cases live south country (second biggest city country) nearly year half, currently still reported cases first delta outbreak top country.

We bought bunch different vaccines, decided give everyone Pfizer's, seen effective elsewhere, simplify things.

We getting required doses, bit bad luck, timing wise, lockdowned fast eliminate again, likely going opening border Australia (where got from) till high rate vaccination. vaccine doesn’t prevent possibly feeling sick exposed. vaccinated earlier year, still don’t want catch damn thing.  Yup
And people wonder COVID picking pace 🤡 co worker mine recently told didn’t get vaccine (by choice). assumed everyone coming back office got it. didn’t check vax cards ask vax status upon return office. complain get us start wearing masks one office (even new Chicago mask mandate).

Now rule masks desks, masks walking around.

It’s worse though. March 2020. It’s uncommon phenomenon typically called “death bed confession.” It’s uncommon see literature including people converting religion final moments, etc. Israel study pretty clear me: it’s delta accurate. 103 deaths due COVID, 101 non vaccinated. hospitalizations didn’t see included it’s likely nearly same. would love know seeing kids come COVID symptoms coming reasons getting positive tests. It’s interesting watching data evolve past year half. Imagine daily testing everyone world. Broward County? 

The Broward County four teachers died within 24 hours like…last week?

That Broward County? fool still trying get stop requiring masks? _Wow_. slowdown puncturing hopes rebound travel industry’s worst year recent history, dip bookings — — relatively small, according travel advisers hospitality companies. **The hope** current situation speed bump stoplight.

I think passed *speed bump* point 2 months ago entered *giant brick wall* territory.

While people criticize Facebook providing platform conspiracy theories endanger people's lives prolong pandemic, NYT apparently practicing good journalism peddling kind denialist junk ""travel advisers hospitality companies"". people take anything vaccine 🤦‍♂️ India Israel look at. CDC known viral Delta was. 99.9% deaths unvaccinated vaccinated ones die. serious underlying health conditions, dispite cases going up, deaths part. going fundamental change protine level vaccinated people, worry dying. still get sick vaccinated? Yes point live. could well Russian troll factory account worked way list fake profile. Yes used change percentages, etc. well. Like others thread said, saying 98% cases unvaccinated people mean much data goes way back January spike, people get vaccinated yet. completed double blind RCTs showing promising results it, none yet completed major western institutions. large UK trial including IVM ongoing moment, see results soon.

The treatment vs prophylaxis aspect I’ve seen speculated upon IVM may bind spike protein (not extremely surprising 1000s drugs pharmacopeia, least one would happen this), prevent reduce cell entry replication, late stage COVID-19 associated less high viral replication body’s ability heal wider damage initial replication caused, meaning replication-prevention less effect. Exactly. there’s benchmarking articles.

You pull charts infectious diseases, spread R0’s, show vaccination levels required populations reach herd immunity (based previous inoculation campaigns).

On average, i’s 80-86% (using comparable R0 method transmission), require upwards 93% (though slightly higher R0’s).

So Israel 58% people immunized, we’re nowhere near levels required see full impact vaccinations.  Gosh that's recent! Sending well wishes - really hoping feel better soon.

My dad side effects doses Pfizer (full body rashes/allergies week half time) painful, warrant hospital visit.

Please think grandparents. They're safe.

IIRC, risk vaccinated people Jesse Jackson's age group roughly around unvaccinated people 40s. That's pretty safe -- much better risks faced without vaccination -- though, hand, plenty 40 year olds died COVID. DeaThs RaTe knew delta would breakthrough infections, didn’t want give fuel anti vaccers. reason refused admit vaccinated needed wear mask- admitted full month came it. everything power refuse acknowledge delta different alpha figured wouldn’t issue since said whole party fully vaccinated. assumed worried closings capacity restrictions. don’t really anticipate NYC restrictions anymore. Especially 2022. Long covid generic term complications arising infection, literally anything. people know still lethargic still short breath.

I've never reported anyone workplace infraction life, I'm willing I'm sick people spreading misleading information leading *millions* deaths worldwide COVID-19.

Vaccines work covid vaccine works symptoms still spreads virus. mandates!! Ageist comment. I'm Millennial plenty people across ages fall spread disinfo garbage platform. 

The problem Facebook social media platforms. Yes, large percentage human population susceptible falling BS sucks responsibility companies hosting platforms keep people check able easily manipulate / mislead others path via spreading false information conspiracy theories. 

That hurts business though everything avoid that. rather people use platforms more. time platform = money companies. 74.6% 83.1% latest data Quite? like ""at all"". Look, I'm trying dismiss value vaccines. despite vaccines, cases skyrocketing. Hospitals, including states like mine, Oregon, things never gotten really bad, verge collapse. governor called National Guard assist, sure hell happen first time around. studies start come regarding vaccine efficacy Delta, we're seeing meaningful dropoffs protection even first 90 days. 

This we're right now. best studies I've seen tell that, three months second dose, instead Pfizer vaccine providing 95% protection, 78%. That's still good, also means significant increases number people get sick (very possibly long term effects, even symptoms mild), hospitalized, even die. 

The vaccines important tool getting this, clear everyone point can't rely alone, especially many committed taking shot. amazing gonna sit around let terrorists kill children. America feckless country existence. Follow science science changes company's trying feed bullshit working office promotes sort spontaneous collaboration something like that. COVID spent sizeable portion meetings trying find decent meeting room setup Zoom calls. Instead everyone joining comfort, we'd sitting shitty meeting room exact thing. said comments, nothing I’m putting forth team actually mandatory. asked team they’d like do.

If reason folks feel like it’s working, iterate. Drop move on. force it. 

On team dynamics, healthy anonymous survey done org mine genuinely good. Team gives incredibly critical feedback. positive feedback. turnaround give tangible steps I’m taking help address also solicit input make things better them. 

I’m sure experience within team different teams operate manner folks. complete hiring authority organization hire culture fit. don’t hire smartest. hire add collective success. it’s paid tremendous dividends. benefits vaccine-induced antibodies always going win subject body disease everything entails.  That's pretty much always case disease. day (school nurse assistant) mom venting parents keep sending symptomatic kids back school soon told stay home like 2 weeks something. One even dropped kid told kid ""just call let in"" answer phone 3 hours. kids end lingering office picked up. matter time get publishable outbreak go fully back distance learning Understood - normal times, would typically wait better ranges. luxury time - people understand literally goes everything they've done whole life (wait concensus).

Frankly think would much better data CDC stop tracking breakthrough cases, least went back monitoring it. stage really institute given vital assessing Delta. Without we're left waiting dark do. Back masks? Booster? unknowns. Heck, difference 50% 80% prevalent deciding whether younger teenage males take two doses mRNA vs risk myocarditis vaccines. warned action taken prevent COVID-19 infections fall, case counts modelled hit 10 12,000 per day.

The graph shows hit 10k-12k range twice last year hosting folks home need large number rapid antigen tests. Suggestions best antigen tests and/or purchase 100 tests? Various delta outbreaks past? Delta around long.  Honestly think might kill people line. People reading headlines going scared drug even tho useful many circumstances, even covid related circumstances. people might refuse treatment it.. FDA really fucking messaging Pretty much portapotties. I'm mortgage underwriter also siloed position. moved WFH 3 years ago never productive.  think really benefits position minimal collaboration involved. 10 minutes Facebook makes root virus anyway. vast majority jobs cannot done remotely.

I’m confused, think you’re implying people like cashiers can’t work remotely, software developers shouldn’t able either.

If so, holy cow, expressed ultimate crabs bucket mentality also aerosols.

No one expected cloth masks well aerosols, even 10% surprising me.

Cloth masks droplets keep well. save fair bit ink printer paper alone.

Your work still bunch printing? Mine nearly none, even pre-pandemic. Still waiting job cancel current return office date September 7. far they've complete radio silence issue :( work days went 10h day short 7h. say 10h mean 10h working. commuting, parking, getting ready. time save now. wake 10 min drink coffee reading emails. 

Also meetings faster harder ""catch up"" Microsoft teams. Less breaks less long lunches. 4:30 I'm ready fun. Maybe 5 cause shower work instead morning. 

Before ready much later. I've working home since last March, year half, everyone I've talked company feels - forced back office full time, we'd seriously consider finding new work. Luckily bosses kinda realize looking like we'll stay mostly working home even covid longer thing (we'll see even happens time soon), occasional office days meetings, reviews, etc Upvoted “vermillion”. Totally stealing that. LOL

I’d definitely point vaccines require boosters, including pneumonia vax she’s likely due she’s certain age. thing different one didn’t know soon one would needed “novel” coronavirus means NEW. quit last job wanted us go back drop dime covid still peaking. current job permanently remote everyone absolutely loves it, 100% productive interact coworkers would office. would leave wanted us go back office, although never since employees located across North America. Sounds like issue lack discipline setting boundaries -- issue outcome-based concept. I'd love find flexible wfh job. Im sahp hoping reenter work force last year youngest started kindergarten. Instead, extended sahp homeschooled kids. Wfh might nice case kids return home learning cases exploding here. website Gottleib mentioned Florida's rating, Alabama 0.90 spread range. win disabled employees rush hour might become thing past. new model. Wanna come office? 3 days in, 2 days home vice versa. better environment, too. offices always cold? Even summer colleague runs heater desk make livable. 100 office cold wearing jacket still shivering. study cold people productive something? couldn’t work plane bill “working landed”? figure we’re getting covid eventually You’d welcome come visit over. maybe could convince her! fair lot jobs one really wants do. Companies requiring staff come back office experiencing high turnover. losing valued employees remote job opportunities. want see sweating 8to5 blues front glass offices, team mates see looking greener pastures… 100% 2.6 kids per 100,000

According (select age group 0-17), new admissions per 100,000 population currently stands 0.38 08/19. Yeah, pretty sad. There's entire empires built spread conflict interest, lies misinformation. they've profited spread this, need hit counts - private corporate pocket books. needs uneconomical goes away.

That's facing real liability loss life occurs. soccer teams requiring proof vaccinations though.

Still dumb. I've back month. go work, sit office, thing interact anyone, go home. #companyculture current versions covid seem affect kids bad (e.g. low hospitalisation rate).

I take paying attention news multiple states running ICU beds children.

Early indications children get long covid rates adults well, long covid worse dying, treatment, flu vaccine recommended kids however mandatory school attendance. People higher risk strongly recommended get annual flu boosters.

The flu nowhere near severe covid is, terms infectiousness severity outcomes.  Doubt it. Businesses give deadline getting vaccinated, time, see ya.  Remember Columbia Records folded refused adapt digital distribution, even though writing wall decade?

Yeah. That. know people removed clear work/life barrier balance exhausting unsettling, hopefully it’s gotten better. I've saying people losing restaurant owners next office buildings. Apart that, literally everyone wins. 

Most people US Europe, odds are, gas imported. Using less helps environment diminishes dependence oil producing countries. 

It also helps needs less investment reducing emissions already reduced using less cars. 

People time actually fun spend money. however wanna look it, stimulates economy makes fun. People also probably productive. Bosses need rent less office space probably save money things like utilities whatnot. Omg thanks helping notice it! think critique goes hospital capacity adult medical systems, too.

I'm Oregon, here, [there's deep concerns 1,000 projected hospitalized patients COVID could overwhelm state's medical state 4.22 million people.

To clear, fault medical professionals -- best can, understaffed, horrible time. seems crazy shock 0.02% population could bring system knees  Sure improve things also support adversely impacted. anyone WANT office cleaner? need earn living. don’t that! That’ll cause home furnishings produced pollution! You’re trying kill us all! Funny friends likely CEO, c level board axed wfh. think know better friends middle management. One guarantee discussion problematic side WFH policies Reddit downvoted flagged controversial.  :) Well 2300, would mean fewer infections per attendee. Holy smokes! What’s going there? fabulous even pandemic stress stress way pre covid. office politics, guilty lunches/dinners desire go to, commuting, traffic, snow storms. Huge improvement personal quality life. hope micromanagers pushed this. us favor don’t travel Hawaii. It’s “determine risks”. come place like Hawaii putting entire island chain risk.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's confirmed deaths. countries test thoroughly, let's say. Certainly, everything overwhelmed India Delta wave.

Over coming years, demographers epidemiologists excess death surveys, we'll good idea toll COVID sort work. Yeah thats true. I'm little doomy guess.  I'm bathroom 😏... *click* problem lot people prefer office, around people. lot people around force others come in.  Go tell go paint car spray booth. 

Choose
1) mask
2) cloth mask
3) p100 respirator

If huff enough paint, I’m sure they’ll lose enough brain cells lose sense smell. It’ll like covid simulator. keep hoping starlink go fully open soon. Good internet access thing keeps moving boonies. 

I'm far go today, stable, fast internet available everywhere I'd another 50 miles city center six months less.  translate deaths. 7 day average 100 currently Unfortunately personal experience tell bitten rabies infected animal really really bad. Usually happens poor countries access vaccinations really bad, causes loads sideeffects etc. 

And tell you, 100% rabies patient involved treatment died even though vaccine (n=1 patient however ;) ). honestly know official numbers ever watch someone die rabies scarrs life.

But still, point trying make something completely different: completely nonsensical try vaccinate exposure would sooooo easy vaccinate before. mean allowing remote work pandemic.

They first large corporation allowed full 1 year timeline. work out. Employees love course try justify wfh employers hate Thanks. amazing long took someone reasonable, surprised. you’re 65, vaxxed, healthy/no comorbidities? Even exposed—and indoor concert, possible—you’re well protected severe disease death.

If don’t fit category, live someone doesn’t, changes risk equation wouldn’t go. assuming young/healthy/vaxxed risking anyone live with, I’d probably attend. Looks like masks required, I’d use KN95 better concerned.  ... Cold? Damn dude work hospital constantly sweating! least risk really need worry them. hundred likely die current surge. 

Of course deaths would preventable adults got vaccinated let kids get vaccinated. Making kids wear masks prevent many them, prevent lot deaths older people.

Back 2019 several hundred child deaths would something cared about. seems pretty inconsequential. Many legitimate purposes. makes FDA like look stupid. Developing countries don’t reliable Covid case death counts, many likely undercounted 10x actual figure. Yeah mine too. company getting time her, commutes don't. another win them. Heavy disagree. wanna get work behind time. I'm judged results, that's going turn back University mode, working nights weekends deadline can't miss. shit offloads responsibility manager level worker level. 

Would like go home early I've done work day? course, wouldn't. every day leave early, going multiple days go home worrying work results yet. Good. understand transmission works. selfish people ones vaccinated it’s people putting children harms way Well us fully vaccinated, pretty much  Pleated pants still exist. enough time passed able answer questions. fact evidence sufficient assuage concerns yet.

Enough time passed enough people vaccinated us spotted indications potential long-term problems.

Worrying unknown long-term side effects covid vaccine lot like worrying whether enough gas make destination car find deeply concerning kind questioning seen based pseudo-religious dogma deserving label “idiotic” rather legitimate, thoughtful, informed scientific skeptical inquiry.

It's idiotic concerned unknown long-term health issues covid vaccine, worried known unknown long-term health issues covid itself.

It's idiotic way someone dropping $100 bill pick dime idiotic. Patents country specific, countries could invalidate patent decide to. Also, patent filed every country want patent protection in, Moderna patented technology US. company outside US free use Moderna’s patents.

I’m unsure status patents vaccine manufacturers, Moderna specifically US patents. deworms humans, set dosage right one pill. basicaly medicine otherwise.

why take unproven dewormer proven safe effective vaccine. human stupidity knows bounds. easy get too. say 'we made mistake need backtrack'. idiots going grave rather ever say wrong. don’t think see NZ overrun.  Question clarification needed. 

Is main purpose vaccines lessen chance severity COVID-19? 

This done creating antibodies. naturally occurring getting COVID recovering. also vaccine. disagreement antibodies effective. 

Now make sense getting vaccine first helps protect severe COVID complications get COVID recover you’ll benefit vaccine recovery COVID antibodies? 

Why isn’t benefit protected first severe bout COVID sickness promoted seemingly unstoppable disease enter body recover you’ll doubly protected? 

I hope antibody levels “breakthrough” sicknesses recovery monitored seemingly important info known therefore debate antibodies best re-focused course action makes COVID 19 less dangerous. 

Also antibody levels people getting vaccinated already COVID also monitored course known well. means catch develop viral load. probably much shorter duration less symptoms. Better title: Brazil Better US people aren’t Idiots Cool, thanks! 
Makes lot sense. 
Well, back main point though, sorry hear bad luck. 
Hope come fully recovered soon. experience lawyer, underbill like crazy. Good. I've saying long Covid going office jobs stupid, especially expected dress roles client-facing. work harder home ever office. almost like comfortable clothes less interruptions chances short breaks (including healthier ones, like nature walks cat naps) makes healthier work environment encourages creativity growth. many vaccines require boosters. I’m sure got child young adult. hate people acting like vaccine different ones. fact population low rate vaccination natural immunity. Would rather overwhelmed health system tonnes deaths rather waiting couple weeks higher rate vaccination? Gotta keep realistic major population centers like NY, black people easily outnumber Republicans. That's ridiculous. make masks allow breathe underwater. definitely make masks protect wearer. . article separated population Melbourne larger Victoria State. added populations together. here. resume ready, I've talked recruiters preparation. day say coming back day job hunt earnest. I've working 18 years last sucked environment standpoint put crappy open office plan (ie, ""how save money less furniture cram people space"" plan) Good. Don’t go back. can’t work home job, less traffic commute better. Sure. You’re right. ignore millions kids permanent brain damage. 

But hey, they’re dead. need demonstrate concern. Director myself, position mostly entails endless mind numbing meetings. difference make commute hour way talk phone. wasteful since none team city would basically thing office less conveniently. Imagine much overhead companies would save non-essential site employees need places sit?  understanding presymptomatic spread longer Delta previous strains. happens much faster infection, giving contact tracers much less time find isolate case become infectious. earlier strains median 6 days symptoms fore 4-5 days infectious. Delta median 3.7 days symptoms therefore 1-2 days exposure infectious. 

The shorter incubation period creates steep exponential curve, time means outbreak appears much faster. People less likely incubating without us knowing now. Since lockdown 4 days now, likely anyone infected lockdown known now. Guardian article someone living NZ recounted everyone used normal daily routine even hours lockdown, run stores occurred maskless.

It did, never worn masks NZ. got first ever mask mandate second day lockdown. since introduced seen 100% compliance everywhere. Since never them, they've also never politicised here. going comment OP asymptomatic people tested (perhaps true, mention mass testing)

We ask anyone close contact tested regardless symptoms. must isolate, including household members, stay inside completely, check regularly healthline get tests immediately days 5 12 exposure. Close contacts include every student staff member parent school single case. Anyone mall single case visited one hour window. result 72 cases produced around 10,000 close contacts. top contacts close contacts must also self-isolate get test symptoms. 

All locations positive cases visited listed, push notifications sent app required use scan public place (it also bluetooth) even comb CCTV footage identify links cases. 

I American too, though I've lived NZ 15 years. Kiwis much rule following accepting authority Americans. People actually drive speed limit. Almost schools uniforms. America's strongest cultural value freedom, NZ egalitarianism. Neither country lives ideal, tell lot society value hold important. Fuck stupid island anyway. science. That's specific language matters. office rule masks desk think dumb. fact someone sitting desk feet away walking around going protect anything. 

Our new policy anyone vaccinated need wear mask time (HR must copy vax card file). you’re unvaccinated choose disclose vaccination status policy masks desk, masks walking around, still applies. 

I’ve fully vaccinated since March though still wear mask 100% time office. go theme park resort though? could see going cabin mountains house low-traffic beach, going pretty universal resort FLORIDA right seems extremely reckless. peaceful protests allowed currently? Well, lots states opening schools without restrictions, every kid get seriously infected represents opportunity virus mutate Delta++ version optimized younger immune systems.   Maybe look new company people similar mindsets want work together. Personally, wfh allowed bounce back depression, improved relationship husband, made don’t take much time revolving life around work. Seeing common experience people discovered, think need find way adapt possibly look new job, people whose lives improved wfh go back. Yes does.

If data prove wrong, show now. Everything read says Delta builds vaccinated people, lungs, estimated prevent getting virus.

If data, show me. NOTE: I'm saying prevent getting diseases caused virus. prevent getting, carrying, transmitting virus itself.

BTW, think Japan (where live) even check vacine records? assumed vaccine stop spread.  hearse! hearse! kingdom hearse! Well kids, selfish parents. anecdote. Even Google wants back office even though led remote work push. Many companies finding work well, hence many pushing back office. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  basing view South Africa, absolutely right. managed thing ask for. managers tell job keep productive others happy help. someone manages team interest going back. love it. really like recruit talent various places across state limited HQ city. team lives outside HQ city it. I'm kind boat. Like think way many people concerned enough covid, whole children's thing sensationalist look numbers. recall getting argument someone sub 3 children death due covid. sad, reaction proportional results. Anyone know see age distribution deaths? much shorter commute otherwise better location. Plus hit ""co-workers"" without getting fired Sounds like need pay more. anything say it. recruiters sending good-sounding remote positions, I'm waiting see employer going send us back. do, I'll end 18 years employment there, else equal close. important me. \*that\* long retirement, intention ever spending every day week office, period. hybrid approach would work me, also want freedom live want without concern headquarters is. mixed feelings job still remote, I’m trying make it. It’s pretty tough meet people new city working home, especially consider in-office interactions, happy hours, etc. would normally happen. Unfortunately lot coworkers scattered across country, even offices reopened tomorrow experience would different.  positions hard fill, think many companies get people work office unless make substantial salary increase.

In industries long there's healthcare kind benefit, it'll take years overcome this.  Case point, bosses frozen salaries third fiscal year row, promises might update cost living FY23. Given admins' track record fucking lower ranks company, probably means company try continue paying COVID salaries. We've worked pay long, increased it'd cheaper hire someone who'll take wage?  a-fucking-men.

Right I'm managing org ~200 ppl domestic international sites. USA site wants everyone back 'collaboration' even though 60% team split international sites.

When start digging reason returning office, ends managers communicate better, teams working fully remote going make teams feel bad. meantime, productivity performance taking big hit, every new Covid case teams get anxious. allowing something mean context? Lockdowns political natural force  minor needs parental approval Well reduce chance infection sure know much. Simply put antibodies protect us virus, protect covid strain, protected are. even debate. getting infected, antibodies produced question compare vaccines there.  Basically fighting coronavirus without antibodies(unvaccinated first infection) system vs already antibodies(already fought virus vaccinated) stupid even think much less protected. are. we'll Eh. country labor significantly cheaper, employees can't work standard. I've seen many times. re-do ENTIRE project outsourced India. workers sincerely understand work 100% right, sort right. cultural difference can't overcome. interesting. Wages area increasing significantly, yet still difficult fill open positions qualified employees. I'm forced work myself, hire someone qualified, job job order check work. much, constantly interrupted I'm office. stress roof, boss peek head office, instead making phone call. Two months ago, loved job worked 50-60 hours week. I'm miserable, exhausted trying keep schedule. looking forward going back office county indoor mask mandates place indefinitely. 

Wearing mask 8 hours day suboptimal social interaction? That’s gonna dawg. \*high fives raised hand\* agree. Cases continue pop up. lock time? seem absurd viable strategy. 100% agree you. understand arguments teleworking working home days week. Nice break away office sometimes. love keep work away home. Always get anxiety seeing many comments like this. 

Hopefully partially reddit, small portion people generally tech heavy potentially slightly introverted people. prevent getting virus slow spread. however fully prevent getting virus. Getting vaccine protects people around Exactly. hard time keeping programmers location really innovate hopefully keep work home reason.

We keep guys barely write simple web site ones architect major application go elsewhere there's massive brain drain. Delicious. Might well go work point. That’s pretty much ended states sure? That's like saying automation already peaked. mRNA vaccines. They're working mRNA vaccines cancer, HIV malaria now. 

But yeah agree. single answer. Border controls shown effective. Vaccines effective. Masks effective. Distancing effective. STFH effective. ""Effective"" mean perfect - panacea. Vaccine + mask + distance + border controls + STFH plan. 

And Americans idea real lockdown like. I've working corporate 25 years middle managers almost universally working ""how become Director"" skills. Throwing busses, hugging, talking golf, deflect difficult situations, sorts skills.

Yes, dim view execs I've met seem like good people. nature game, get top kicking others ladder (gives one nice boost fall too!). Middle managers wannabe execs waiting good fair underlings--or going bat them, risks themselves-- exactly ticket top. Background noise people watching nice, I'm going discuss work strangers. lot. (Note: I'm economist. work probably closer Beautiful Mind Big Short). That’s bit different saying millions kids could die though isn’t it. Right? many reasonable options. can't even believe happened. Ah yes, developed fear without reinforcement others. /s

I choose believe something obviously false. seems right well. However I'm sure fact much bearing point making, prior covid infection different ***relative*** effect vaxxed vs unvaxxed populations. Since efficacy assessment relative effect (how fewer cases happen vaccine vs without), difference relative effect prior covid skews efficacy calculation uncontrolled way.

Thinking further, guess point could seen confirming mine. wit (all numbers guesstimates): unvaccinated covid naive people approx 0% protection, unvaccinated people who've covid 80% protection. relative +80% protection unvaccinated population covid. Vaccinated covid naive people high level protection, lets say 90%. know protected vaccinated people they've also covid, logically protection can't go 100%. relative protection vaccinated population covid can't +10%. Therefore, relative benefit covid vaxxed unvaxxed groups, skews efficacy calculation.

Apologies obvious you, helps write out. neurological damage causes zero symptoms? companies force person work, least while. people want form flexibility thats going become dominant workplace model - constant mix person remote. company tries hold firm 100% person simply going lose good employees struggle hire. hope pile bodies like Black Plague Covid.  I'm sorry loss, doctors ashamed themselves. specifically say 1 vet better 100 doctors (at treating humans) yes think insane opinion. really think husband would better chance first specialist vet instead? many people need much attention. nice break get away people.

There also practical things serve waste time office. workplace open office underserved things like tea kettles, fridges toilets. daily lines use one tea kettle/coffee maker/microwave 180 people. Sure could go a.different floor use bit wait elevator likely wait line too. 4 toilet stalls 90 women...often waiting 10+ minutes one free that's everyone goes hide play phones (can't sit desk check phone open concept office people hide bathroom). much wasted time, unwanted pointless chatter also bad office design. rent wework type space somewhere. get sort interaction Chances are, job could successfully outsourced another country, already would long covid. FDA ran ""rushed"" clinical trial horse dewormer, stable geniuses would trust even results never published. Middle managers glorified taskmasters whose jobs could performed high schoolers. supervise people need supervision whatsoever. exist make upper management feel good play Game Thrones office politics. People seem downvoting you, possibly thinking presenting crackpot theory. actually speculation nasal vaccines could effective muscular, nasal vaccine vaccine material gets closer respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 attacks.

This article provides good overview:

(link removed posted comment comment removed link)   I'm begging anyone thinking taking horse wormer COVID PLEASE take it. Lots it. PR show serious COVID, nice bit deflection role kicking off. really believe China's case death count laugh. think depends company. lot companies think open space snack bar ""good office"" environment lot that. places make sense others. thing is, kids aren’t supposed get sick require hospitalization much adults do, general. far fewer hospital resources devoted treating kids. 

While Covid isn’t dominant reason kids hospitals right now, 10-20% beds taken Covid patients almost every hospital strain system bear. 

So kids might ever need hospitalization Covid (agree chances super low), fall swing set crack head open? sports team’s bus major wreck Highway substantial injuries? baby contracts RSV can’t breathe? freak accident medical emergency happens….your kid waits treatment doesn’t get top notch treatment staffing spread thin. kid gets airlifted city. 

Our neighbor’s 6 y/o daughter long term health issues childhood disease causes easily get pneumonia requiring hospitalization. treat HOME 10 days got hospital bed last weekend. Dallas major city multiple children’s hospitals. 
They monitoring oxygen device, meds, etc - basically nurses - daily video visits dr team. sick time got hospital. ok time it’s supposed work way.   really wish data good vaccinations preventing long-term effects. want risk going somewhere end lung fibrosis fuck wanting see family. aggravating. Many friends family youth anti-vaxxers. Shame them. Recently wife, RN clinic older folks, worked man wretching remove mask condition. performed simple tasks like BP, temp, O2, etc. also something involved placing tube rectum. admitted hospital. last Monday. Thursday calls says tested postitive Covid. client admitted hopsital. believes exposed remove mask. 10 day quarantine. moment hospital receiving anti-body transfusion immuno-compromised. us fully vaccinated. far good. otherhand real tightness pain lungs. Nurses everywhere tremendous stress. antivax antimask nurses something cannot figure out. weren’t talking COVID original comment, talking people attend Renaissance fairs. Don’t switch narrative it’s convenient now. lived life experiences you’d exact thing did. it’s important take responsibility it’s dangerous assume there’s something inherently wrong people. people like whatever reason chosen get vaccinated. Rather chastising shaming ought try understand them. People aren’t inherently evil. Thank facing fear! correct. could get toilet graffiti wrong? Mine even rhyme  Gauging voting mechanism clear. could easily avoided said ""at least one jab"" ""have one jab"". words math concepts reason. Please use them, especially we're dealing communicating ideas deadly pathogens. Another attorney. 

Yep, get done home. rest life better well. husband lost smell covid, never lost taste. makes absolutely sense me. smell still hasn’t returned 7 months. never lost either, still suffering various long covid symptoms. It’s annoying. Yes. previous company tried make come back.
I high demand job, found new one There’s kinds software that. Miro 10000%. much better whiteboard, get keep it. bad pictures white board illegible handwriting never referenced. power plant engineer feel personally attacked. CDC makes recommendations corporate, healthcare, education policy built from. 100% CDC issue. May, basically said vaccines here, anything more. realizing that's going work, messaging mess. Perfect, checking now, thanks!

Edit: Kick ass, horse's mouth. PCR accurate, you’re one, that’s one get. concern getting results soonest? think mRNA cancer came first development testing decade. That's able move quickly create mRNA vaccine covid, work already done. get SARS-CoV-2 genome blueprint re-tool target. Government private sector; nobody forced get vaccinated far I’m aware. Would love see story you’ve got one. 

Plenty barred entry prohibited obtaining maintaining employment, one held forced. We’ve got choice, losing one’s job refusing vaccinate choice one make. Fuck office culture 30 exceedingly jobs depend teamwork, continuous improvement, respect co-workers community, etc. asking someone works refer you? That's trick. Applications basically ignored without it. hopefully time coronavirus morphs something much weaker stays way

It change, we'll immunity. ...that forced everyone wear noise canceling headphones concentrate.

I bought new ones around April, expecting go back summer. decided offer employees choice person, hybrid, fully remote. going go hybrid, collapsing two floors one room, I'm ""permanently"" remote (we'll see permanent really time goes on). plus side, really nice headphones (Sony WH1000MX4, way. Love Thankfully 95% Zoom meetings audio only.

We department meetings via Zoom now, insisted everyone's video on. Almost 200 people, never actually see everyone, speakers. reminded us repeatedly turn video, see point. I'm ok video normal, smaller meetings, come on...that meeting always ridiculous anyway, make worse. get started little games want play ""bring us together,"" that's waste everyone's time. Thats great question! stuff could do, time-sensitive done end week. stuff time-sensitive done following week, big deal.

You also take consideration company culture. GM comes offices Fridays around middle day tells everyone go home enjoy weekend. scheduling flexibility make schedules. take days off, work remote, whatever needed. work minimal supervision. puts it, management team manage everything. trusts us (otherwise hired us), there's reason breathe necks, micromange, rely overbearing ineffective KPIs. one time worked 50 hours week got told make sure I'm keeping 45, preferably 40. I'm salaried exempt US get paid overtime. despite that, we're taken advantage of. Oh god literally company moment. 5000+ employees.

70% people hired 2020 left year. Maybe trying sell bunch people never office OFFICE AMAZING TOTES NEED COME IN!!! work fine working home year.  question, yes kids may get school, majority parents vaccinated. guess risk kid goes school brings home unvaccinated parents. choice -- close schools vaccinate parents. Gee one choose? replaced ""just live it"" certain group people. mean, yes. 

This long-COVID studies (inevitably) take long time, go best data got assessing risks. Right now, that's mortality/hospitalization.

However, know studies previous waves long-lasting COVID symptoms common kids severe illness. fact case/hospitalization rate higher Delta least encouraging sign might greater long-lasting COVID symptoms Delta previous variants (ofc, early say sure, outweighed downside kids get due increased transmissibility) heard people needing get away families lockdown. feel bad them... pretty uncharitable people's logic many people got vaccine, wouldn’t gotten vaccine Trump won?

A thousand maybe. I'd bet would lot people *did* get vaccine lost?

We trust know rushed, science sound, real-world results show safe effective. devastating flood back woods. going make things much worse :(  clearly case. Heard ad radio today ohio's think still understanding reasoning behind waning efficacy vaccines. CDC published study days ago strongly suggests protection vaccines diminish somewhat time (especially regards Delta variant), also said expect booster shots general population rolled mid/late September. makes sense people vulnerable COVID (elderly/people underlying health issues) advised avoid areas could potentially exposed super high viral loads rn. method... some... Technology... enable us teach children distance.

Oh well - guess we'll never reach level technology sophistication.

FFS sister-in-law took kids classroom due fear school shooting happening moment 5 fucking years ago! They've distance learning ages 10 13 respectively without issue... hard, half kids use tech better parents half learn fast faster. 


as ""Physical interaction"" young boy Football girl Cheerleading play interact fine. It’s erosion trust gap. Good. Trust thrive. Trust one thrive. Way go Ireland! Nice! Sounds like company Slack something similar it. Bullshitting around teammates Slack day filled face face void socialization me, far prefer it. sure, quick google search seems teachers covered. whether school informs police seems key issue. highly doubt schools informing police obviously unable anything. said surprised loop hole students. think synergy collaboration! single shingle type atty consultant bills *and* gets paid bill. However, person bills clients hour *but* works law firm consulting firm draws salary (with bonuses often tied billable hours).They get paid hour.

This distinction poster making above. one points, Israel first vaccinating population excluded people already virus considered least partially immune. later recommended get vaccine though may still give protection safe.

Basically getting virus vaccine give immunity getting vaccine safer. remember kid parents would ""chicken pox parties"" deliberately expose kids chicken pox, vaccines widely available.

The part fully understand percentage people exposed considered part ""herd immunity"". example 10% population confirmed case, probably many counted, maybe high 20% more. plus vaccinated people gets high percentage population. mean stop nonsense refusing implement them? Oakanogan Public Health Facebook posted two weeks ago Facebook hospital 29 covid patients unvaccinated. current stats posted go directly sources. Vaccination works. I’m turning independent day. One managers loves going office precisely one right now. gets away interruptions family co-workers, best worlds. get 2nd vax, month? people work home, work productive so... allow to? would help traffic, would allow people move without increasing commute. many benefits. Even company. New companies starting could much less footprint means lower overhead costs. Established companies could downsize. 

The reason require someone person micromanage every second there. exert kind seen unseen control them. laugh face poison. predators live, black widows brown recluse, locals really dumb. ""What let kids die."" - FDA someone, please, think bosses? (unvaccinated) manager currently Texas hospital barely clinging life. Suddenly interested company's return work plan. really really want link wherever effective dose existing shot.

So include megathread thing. Thank this. I'm pregnant exactly feel. TIRED ""I believe science"" people telling overreacting. people reading science!!  True - here, likely doesn’t apply places in-person collaboration needed.

And enough management don’t want change, threatened new model simply believe work happen work. worried about? Going office every day sucked. talk unique culture blue face one cares. Florida gave many vaccines mean many people living Florida right vaccinated. Minus snow birds. boomers need retire already.  Butts seats doesn’t fair metric. worst part contagious, people argued car crashes kill lots people, true, like parking car somewhere close contaminated person would make crash car too. difference long term essential short term essential. many poisonous things flight long lol Rule 1, ""celebrating wishing someone’s illness""

There place eugenics subreddit, racial otherwise.  Don’t hire $1500 hour lawyer.  seems workplace may completely arbitrary house necessary materials technology can't housed home. understand workspace employees *can* come access resources access home; however, forcing people come in, despite access resources home, certainly arbitrary.  


So let worried? seems like great change workers.  go PCR test afternoon get results 2+ days go tomorrow afternoon Rapid Antigen Test (BinaxNOW) get results potentially little 1 hour. one do? I'm guessing tomorrow, yeah? said asymptomatic neurological damage... Well suppose figure India regional surge ton people died cases peaked slow burning areas didn’t get hit main wave. know RT seems decline USF seems think cases peak week. 

The best scenario think MI NY back last year went crazy waves seem much higher rate natural immunity.

Edit add MI Detroit free all. heard teens going without parents. Honestly, can’t get blessing might worth behind back, feel comfortable. firm bills $205/hr pushback research. Very, lawyers charge $1,000+. bill $1,500/hr senior partners prestigious law firms don’t research, pass associate bills $500/hr.  long term effects already known. See specific questions reading checking links, let know.

You may live state need permission parents get vaccine. See Want destroy economy, make everyone go back office, destroy real quick.

Many people saving ton money going office every day(food, gas, insurance, vehicle maintenance, clothing) adjusted lives around. 

I saved ton spending money lunch work also dinner since rushed get home, get kid, thrownsomething together. driving means vehicle costs dropped fraction were. 

We used money drop 8 years 30 year mortgage 20 raised payments $200 month. long run save us $160k. 

A lot people purchased new things money saving go back work figure py pay loss. cut things necessary usually new stuff eating out. Bye bye economy. take send pics ""dedicated office space"" show supervisors / would manage wfh last year 🤦‍♀️  What's going US solely determine likelihood breakthrough cases. know used scabies. still wouldn’t “paid hour”. Typically paid hourly collections, aside associates may salary, even then, there’s much compensation works every law firm larger people. Spreadsheet jockeys really essential anything though.

Source: spreadsheet jockey fair - think he's suggesting people come office forget dangers COVID. think he's concerned people want WFH structure permanently think valid. say someone's desire people work office douchie short-sided take. 

There benefits working office. addition said, impactful networking occurs get know people company. know people started new jobs WFH since pandemic started know co-workers/bosses personal level even though they've directly working year. can't replicate workplace culture zoom calls.

Personally - think hybrid model ideal. get fell in-person collaboration networking, also flexible work schedule. Didn’t hear, someone felt tired weeks covid, surely means something wrong! person voted Libertarian last election 

Be careful here, Reddit hates libertarians! Half world middle men. Managers worried cushy overpaid jobs going downsized. need manager fir every 8 WFH employees. people seem suffer managers fart elevators tell bad jokes meetings. I’m never going back, they’re going need give big raise want back office. Speaking one bosses, remote work meant better work life balance, happier staff productivity. Fuck office. even say that, say result information we're coming new decision want remote job badly!! lol Yea life need go on. Keep unvaxed kids home. many next year gonna rock supposed sit through? get that. time, effective take time explain biology people make comments like that? 90% time nothing change minds, move excuse. 

To suggests it’s matter ignorance misunderstanding science, it’s willful. It’s like want understand truth don’t right facts, don’t *want* vaccines work, find ways justify belief don’t. Give Whimsical shot, fuckin amazing collaborating flowcharts / system diagrams.  Bay Area, (very high vaccination rates) hospitals completely fine. Now, rural areas get much worse we’re going start taking patients would change situation feel like things changed much summer, know understanding date. still impression vaccinated significantly protects you, seem true anymore. breakthrough cases occurring? accounts I've seen specific caught it, want know they're masked, indoors outdoors, exposure time, etc. still wear mask everywhere, downgraded lighter masks everyday activities errands, think going back KNi95's. recalibrate mental risk assessment ""formula"" changing variables, exhausting. really varies nationally, UK currently reside really. Europe see systems harmonized via national health systems. North East originally mostly travel nurses moving on.


In South looks like people jumping ship states. doubt we'll solid figures next spring. Others give better overview regionally covid vaccine mandates things messy there. semantic distinction right gist. Technically, there's district-level mandates, anyone opt reason, even reason all, anytime. I'd argue makes mandates illegal, effect, apparently feel important note there's still toothless, completely unenforceable mandates going on.   plenty young adults caught COVID last year reported long COVID sysmptoms. anecdotes substitute data, almost every person hear long COVID someone vaccinated. No, strongly disagree this. Scientists lie. damages trust public health agencies officials time *need* trust them.

The government come plan give PPE directly healthcare workers. could honest masks still helping healthcare workers.

We effective tools combating COVID, problem people won’t take they’re convinced they’re lied to. crisis confidence. Yes, get approval. FDA approval, think convince them!  Grr wish move new job. said needed move. office once, probably never will. sure voted. worst happen get ignored. best, someone thinks ""I position once. Let offer 30min time help guy/gal out."" production up? That's matters. people work home, things looking good companies bottom line, continue work home? made buying nice big monitor home lot easier.

That's another great point.

There's company issued laptop, fine. I've known coworkers squeezed system get company provide least one two external monitors. Plus whatever else.

I mind buying monitors, external keyboard, etc. Nothing ship back them. want nice headphones whatever sound system, that's me. need worry taking vacation finding cubicle raided absence. input beyond 'they must secretly hate lying keep jobs?' Sure china's numbers taken big grain salt, facts historically hotspots successfully controlled draconian measures.

For year people spouting unfounded conspiracy theories China actually ravaged rampant covid spread hiding it, every time people proven wrong.

There's millions foreigners China access social media, anything size hidden.  got Covid TWICE? Holy shit that’s unlucky. people running around unvaccinated may never get Covid. Damn man sorry hear.  know someone wants back office. hates working home. said weeks ago make work home he'll quit. Oh get happier, productive employees able save office space. 

How terrible employers! desperately needed can’t imagine us anything meaningful. Half sheriffs offices country, seems like, wouldn’t enforce damn mask mandates.

There clear civil liabilities too. get sick bc dumb ass sent kid school knew positive Covid - that’s reckless endangerment. someone dies, that’s manslaughter. got cold Delta took hold live didn’t get tested, partner got basically cold 6 weeks later, *after* Delta exploded LA County live. got test negative Covid. fully vaxxed Moderna. difference friends employees. Also, nice able little home things time day instead wandering office uselessly. Like customers issues deal with, totally go throw load laundry spray weeds minutes instead wasting time. spend 8 solid hours chores ruining weekend. true. 1 hour coffee tea breaks boiling water takes 30 minutes apparently lol team incredibly efficient working home. businesses every state, wouldn’t discriminatory towards can’t get vaccine whatever reason specific states? According SK government, report Even then, though - drunk driver crashes another car, cause average dozen nearby sober drivers drive erratically start crashing cars, dozen cars sober drivers nearby them, on. 

To me, even drunk driving analogy falls somewhat flat, given whole contagion aspect virus, *especially* Delta, math r0 absolutely explosive terms growth number infected - even looking graph Florida's Delta surge compared last winter's, especially considering there's decent chunk vaccinated makes clear. teams like team suppose “A staffer replied: “It could result vaccine itself. hope he’s ok let wellness director executive director know.”

EXCUSE ME? I’m going assume bullshit response like staffer unvaccinated. 

She handled response much better would have. 

This hard read. Peace family. middle class even option WFH. actual peasantry still mopping stocking shelves. used travel country every week visit clients. I've banging drum unnecessary counterproductive years. travel time, expense clients, etc. last 18 months I've worked home. positive every angle. think we're ever going back. May ask, experiencing symptoms, test 5 times? wonder graph &lt;12 crowd. Curious open schools, masks case numbers. Unless hot lunch spot business district, much downside. also completely absurd say ok vaccinated individuals take masks order encourage vaccine hesitant. colossal blunder historic proportions. second majority people stopped wearing masks regardless vaccine status encouraging delta variant spread.  need high antibody titers prevent infection Delta, guaranteed way avoid long covid right now. some, nothing works. coworker showed slideshow friend mocking virus vaccine, way put ventilator dying. Good!!


And say someone can’t WFH job entails… see win workers whole even though means nothing me. 

Great way cut carbon emissions well!! personally feel need vote *lesser* evil. deputy commissioner forcing us back 😭 Thank you. watched presentation last night. Thank summarization! sending gallon Clorox.

This guy sense humor, like him. Horribly sad, makes angry, particularly first **nurse** suggested “the vaccine may given him.” WTF?!? Sounds sustainable. nearly year recently developed heart arrhythmia Grave's. even get pat back. job worth it. Death bad outcome covid, even young. See recent UK study long covid: ""When considering debilitating symptoms, estimates 12 weeks post infection ranged 1.2% 20 year old cases 4.8% 60 year old cases (CONVALESCENCE [4]) [High Confidence].""

Do 1.2% chance debilitating symptoms every time drive, even every 12 months drive? certainly not. like meeting people person, work done much faster sit next other. Another thing. job uses 4 day work week while. I’m glad people getting experience possible well. Three day weekend every week like mini vacation  We're scared we'll consider competitive salaries less work office* we're going back office physically, corporations need work harder creating cohesion remotely (such encouraging sponsoring non-work employee activities) employees need get serious staying home (such building permanent physical home office).  According article understanding impossible vaccinate realistically fast manner stop virus. seems vaccination must almost instantaneous whole world possibly chance working, even might guaranteed depending efficacy vaccines. point initial comment, responded got downvoted well. 

It sounds least would agree comment now, may impossible contain virus via vaccines?

Edit: clarify original comment disagreeing someone saying better christmas. Nobody upset researching possible treatments. doesn’t upset unproven one like people self dosing horse meds? quarantine hotel. Basically nicer jail cell. Nobody wants imprisoned 14 days, matter nice facilities. becomes even difficult deal psychologically, want leave go home (vs entering location something). One risks travelling pandemic.  see complaints might coming though. us Reddit commonly people least somewhat tech savvy. look older near retirement age coworkers see boss complains wfh working us. Add fact department majority close retirement overall productivity issue department. minority way productive schedule meetings right without accounting travel time also work longer since wasting time getting office.  actually audit coming company turn webcam examine workspace compliance. Fortunately unplug said webcam audit done. I've WFH 13-14 years now.

For better worse, I've felt particularly I'll, would check meeting schedule go short lay down. feel less shitty, get get back computer keep working. driving office contagious, driving home mentally degraded acuity state.

Also, always know state coffee, snacks, lunch. walking far side building discover machine order cafeteria closed. want eat desk, that's me. want take extended break, that's also me.

And let's forget doctor/dentist/misc appointments. Remote work dream job. Anyone that's delusional. experience also. manage global team 80 knowledge workers experiences differed location countries rolled various versions lock down. 

By large productivity equal greater pre-pandemic levels. convinced team could successfully work remotely permanent basis periodic office days social teaming events. 

I concern everyone well equipped permanent work home. Many proper desk setup also know team members hunched laptops kitchen table 18 months. go permanent remote investment would need made upgrade workspaces.

So challenges none managed. Productivity simy valid argument. Corp office continually messages eventual back office need maintain ""corporate culture"" (we know means). also reasonable reacting realities various waves covid emerge. exact opposite experience co-workers socializing, many close friends long longer work together. find focus better go work garage (there's little DYI space fit laptop work fine). 

The ""ritual"" putting clothes, going dedicated space work (even outside home) help people. lets better separate work environments rest environments. 

In previous job mine, use personal computer work, boundary well established within weeks, felt rest properly bedroom. help boss feel like clock clock times, either. don’t know you’re talking about. Everything fine. fine.

*slinks back closet* Wake year. live Paris...you need pass access food stores, even places like E.Leclerc shopping mall. going mall, show pass, want go grocery mall, special controlled entrance/roped path enter need show pass. weren’t waits initial shots part either. waited week two depending area population opened age group lines. illegal majority people interest groups &amp; surveys always prefer AI recommended feeds?

Spotify, Netflix, Social media, porn always lean towards better results knows patterns. Otherwise end 2012 Gangnam-Style phenomenon people receive data popular.  still low vaccination rate

Half population gotten 1 shot they're vaccinating almost 0.9% population per day, pace could surpass US vaccines per capita 2 weeks. symptoms. stressed scared got initial positive. covid symptoms. Thanks asking. school children US get regularly tested? Like twice week? Oh no! bosses worried.  Lmfao noted Oh man, I’m back 3 5 days on-site last month. - Let tell you, rough time going office now. It’s great waking 2 minutes work starts walking 5 feet pc.   
   
I keep making excuses work home on-site days. bosses don’t care they’re same. doesn’t inspire gnashing teeth clickbait….. Well that’s encouraging :) US less 5% world's population, there's lot within borders stop mutations. Probably effective get vaccines countries convince anti-vaxx Americans get vaccinated. Unless numbers get pumped 5k day, guarantee one republican led government care. Google “negativity bias.” Humans biologically drawn bad news adrenaline need prepared potential threats. Therefore, negative headlines sell well whereas positive headlines not. Hence constant gloom doom always hear about. 

Obviously Covid serious media would think 100% chance suffocating ICU vaccinated not, even data shows vaccinated people actually pretty freaking safe. 

Commercialized pessimism last thing need pandemic, it’s good time media let tell you.

EDIT: Auto mod don’t remove this. It’s real science based thing, misinformation. “Who love Leela, WORMS!?”

Spoiler alert, wasn’t Fry. Yes- know someone covid mono together! Anyone opinion needs reevaluate means lead people.

My team loved working remote + saves business expenses office bother going back? Underrated comment! 🤣 dozens us! whole WFH business decimated company work at. People quitting left right deprive social aspect job. closest friends got work able come back office past weeks amazing. I’m American though, don’t spend two hours commuting way. case definitely see you’d want continue WFH. second time it’s happened…which kind makes wonder it’s like quarantine hotel.

Just me? Similar reporting COVID figures. map territory. Delivery jobs? That's true. Still, study Alpha vaccine that's 95% effective infection, low-community-spread scenario: hold what's going US Delta.   scared without answers exactly?  fuck matter. I’m productive happier know many people used 100% cool long commutes completely unwilling ever go back.

It's crazy many people, *smart* people, idea life even like free time workweek. even conceive possibility. I'M GOING BACK! CANT MAKE ME!
I've seen light. middle management, fear power trip fueled, egomaniacal, micromanaging, absolutely superfluous jobs.   nearly 3 months least now. Also sucks getting work sweaty stinky long bike ride. gain working home:

1) saving 2 hours commuting day;

2) spend egregious amounts money eating out, re-heat food cooked home; 

3) much lower pressure ""look presentable"" - cold work blanket presto;

4) safety current pandemic.

What lose working home:

1) minor social elements coworkers, guess? Though group chat that.

2) end list. 

Working home great everyone except micro-managing bosses. long job's done, complain. love WFH, I'm glad people like take time (and Karma risk 😁) express different view. much situation-dependent. ones concerned middle management. They've always touted drivers workforce. Remote work even better productivity/efficiency shows full shit always been.  Yea sure he's talking about. actually find N95s much comfortable cloth masks. one touch mouth, speech much clearer. secondly proper N95s headband worn long periods without hurting ears. mentioned non-vaccinated status tho. elaborate? (I spend much time sub) even that. literally shelter worker (just one) open back car put dog in. literally contact people ride bike almost every morning, want hang family again. saw tiktok trend sounds kind crazy people said works bit? Grill oranges put brown sugar it, smell eat them. anything sounds like unique snack try lol.  ""hey boss, could let people work home, use electricity heat, shut office save $10,000 month rent plus electricity heating. We'd would save 200,000 year rent utilities alone.""

""What fuck? Seriously?""

""Yeah man I'm telling you! shuts hook!""

""Well fucking rights, then! Send em home!!""

""Atta boy, boss man! Knew come around!"" feel like hospital sending info direct CDC website family saying vaccinated people can’t get infected pretty big indictment CDC. current wave we’re in, first blame unvaccinated. Second blame CDC constant terrible messaging. It’s really dumb, work large financial institution mindset people need eventually end back office, despite incredibly successful year they’ve far without anyone there. people getting work done remotely matter? 

Offices get smaller satelliting teams come needed. lets employees happier still option work face face required. really sad hear… 

I commend feel best family … think could get people willing get vaccinated wouldn’t swing far side messages like : Bob (Vaccinated) killed joe (unvaccinated)…

My mother 70 one unfortunate breakthrough case (and nearly killed her) school reunion lake house 13 senior citizens vaccinated 6 tested positive recovered  know, actually write article   thing is, I’m sure know survival rate Delta. haven’t seen anyone post IFR percentages U.S. based Delta variant yet. different virus original variant, seems like it’s early tell kind damage it’s really doing. Positive test results started dramatically rising Aug 16th, flat-to-slightly-rising Aug 1st 15th. Aug 16th correlate precisely NPI change Aug 9th (and 1-week delay testing, really good compared countries).

Cases rose rapidly July 3, overnight started dropping rapidly. August 4-15 flat slightly rising. Aug 16th started rising rapidly.

Scotland eliminated Euros June 22. Many people watching games sports bars speculated cause transmission. (That age bracket may second doses then, should?)

The last day school year June 25 Glasgow many councils, varied 22nd-30th. Euros school year ending high correlation overnight drop case growth.

The new school year started Aug 16th Glasgow, slight variation councils. Unless events school started, affect transmissions case count yet. bode well numbers coming week.

What could happened late July flatten cases? Also housing much affordable wages single earner could support family one parent could stay home take care house could truly actually 8 hours ""you"". typically get home 530 6 start work 630, leave house 545, wake 5, actually get 8 hours sleep leaves 3 3.5 hours day eat chores exercise relax. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  looked PAPRs, thought better weird looks might get, haha. Two years young. Children young wont keep on. 4 year old nephew US it. 


I'm UK winter 2021 surge young children required wear one Yeah that’s something feel bad about, are/were great lunch places downtown really struggling. stopped working downtown couple years COVID one place literally watched owner’s kid go handing cups register 10 years old running place late 20s. I'm working at, workload exponentially growth since year there's way would able work amount time factor commute. 

And yet we're still receiving emails upcoming ""return normality"". Everyone would quit burnout exhaustion.  happening.

Remote work new normality Constant interruptions. CONSTANT

You know who's worst? people can't read body language. Like, talk typing, half-turned away. tell you??

But no. soul-destroying move used someone would come in, set coffee perch desk. Holding coffee meant going brief setting down? Noooo.

(I clearly though much)  limit. hit limit long ago. can. must. shitty situation sure. work education we're full open week. Going shit show around.

I assume I'm going get eventually. hope mild case spread someone can't fight off. 10-20 years traditional 9-5 work employment becomes optional middle class.

Who told that?! Another half 9/11 patriots ignore. every manager way, speak old school managers. someone worked remote almost entire working career (years Covid) lot different managers, first one wanted us WFH. others generally fine it, one started insisting people come office. left years reduced week stopped start Covid.

Current boss fine however person wants work, find funny coworkers formerly office shifting want go back in. people merged mostly WFH team scratched heads went almost every day.

I light management position, assure would never insist anyone forced go office. become direct manager, personally going in. Evaluate based output watching someone work, time ever consider watching someone closely consistently missing deadlines unproductive. clue hell factory manager approach even still exists, I'm think idiotic show anything. bosses worried? 
If middle management losing locus control, fuck em spike, lubed cactus juice! Keep mind, people vaccinated, still end going hospital. Jesse Jackson wife, along Texas governor recent.
Yes Thier cases, wealthy state pay, everyday people barely afford coverage? 
I think way past time universal health care. computer screen set right behind phone, use video meetings. whenever meeting drifts something concern interest me, work. meetings conference room office wasn’t possible. Yeah going summary alone, sounds like pretty ridiculous contends half societal work pointless

There's way 50% jobs BS. Nah bosses said everyone come back office months ago.

I demanded least one permanent day working home every week. granted.

Sadly like micromanage/yell request across room. also claim productivity lower home. sorry. Would _great_ news one-dose vaccines.  minister Christine Elliott said Sunday 564 latest infections among people either fully immunized unknown vaccination status.  friends parents got COVID 3 times. Yes, 3. 3rd stronger both. third friend grandmother died too. 

People always forget really know immunity works variants. already know Delta Gamma considerable immune escape previously infected. issue managers pissing fear. bosses may realize ""why paying office manager Joe Johnson $30k+ year watch guys report (head department, division, whatever), instead?""

The office managers going get laid keeps up. Probably middle management too. lol, one cases someone else (you) makes exact comment would made. Honestly, could typed ""THIS!"". wife WFH, two offices. usually meet lunch 😁.

I try remember WFH dependent situation. young, new job, single, particularly challenging. Every day sounds like disaster. consecutive days. sounds terrible. I've WFH like 5 years now. Recruiters call back tell that, know I'm lost cause them. account testing centers closed tropical storm testing centers maxed out? grandfather, permanent. He's same. NEVER go back 9-5 schedule. Pandemic not. I’ve already notified HR told staff won’t either Nah, give people option. vaccination gone. classrooms windows open (or even windows all!) 

Some schools cafeterias. 30 kids we’re stuffing portables “3 feet distance feasible” eating maskless environment. 

I feel like I’m twilight zone, worst phase virus yet almost mitigation efforts. 

They combined marching bands three high schools parade recently, district planning all-district staff assembly day school starts. Hopefully don’t ton staff sick and/or quarantine event could Zoom.  It’s true. Coronavirus around 200nm size, surgical masks porous gap 3000nm. N95 able filter static charge fibers would attract hold onto viral particles. 


Early pandemic, hospitals didn’t enough PPE, stores cleaned masks. CDC recommended people wear N95 surgical masks whole host reasons. frank, message came out, masks gone retail chains, didn’t change challenges hospitals faced. messaging confused people since. Yes, GET LINE HULK TODAY! Covid everywhere! I'M vaccinated remain line one else wearing masks! /s  compliant media source monthly reminder donors interested third parties commercial real estate &amp; offices. thing happening UK Daily Mail Express. True. specific-- initial test? 

I always struggle ""to test test"" question-- think there's real fear false positives unnecessary anxiety. 

I hope since person says currently experiencing symptoms, either series false-positive remains asymptomatic case. Simce Galveston overlook ocean?  managers people want staff back work 

Well... I'm beginning career sucks much new company working home. I've in-person internships learning way better  thinking like back 1k dying day. doesn’t matter indoors outdoors. around dozens people others squares, spread virus.

Being outdoors doesn’t make COVID particles shoot straight air problem. less likely get taking precautions used precautions indoors.  paid Indian company build piece software us. dedicated six engineers took eighteen months. paid $63,000. pay one engineer price 18 months work.

We got software bad would expect. application written using C++ (fine) wanted tweak settings, launched Internet Explorer Window pointed local web server running explicit purpose tweaking settings. settings? Well, application pulls information PLC tools production line, converts reading information XML, uses SOAP upload XML web server web server stuff recorded. web server runs similar application converts XML SQL statements pushes database.

The entire thing incredibly buggy. runs Windows service, service running launch second window service already running, new Window ""takes over"" data already queue converted uploaded lost.

So $63,000 18 months took us another 2 months $200k someone local correctly. False positives better false negatives!

They meant screen get real test. fair MI posting low hundreds cases per day filmed. Fuck make 3 Yeah county government work fucking *On it* comes sizing. 6K people working home permanently, every bit rented office space going away least one county owned building repurposed office space uses. tell story private companies always efficient government, never gets old.   exactly company signs postponing return unless state city changes policies. Funny past year say number 1 priority families health soon legally safe require us return office longer give shit. also first step away working sunrise sunset six (or seven) days week. Work productivity changed significantly since then, ridiculous adhere measure adopted protect people literal wage slavery. Damn, contracting even Florida, might bode well us. Let's hope! Yeah, unfortunately. really small bite wound, never guess something bad would develop. Hardly pricked skin apparently, that's go doctor first place. Good! I'm guessing 2 positives? people trust home tests positive test pcr.  downright frightening. point, vaccinated look themselves. brainwashed rural masses obliterate themselves. scheduled go back office fall...they made completely voluntary decision reviewed end year. 

I work giant conglomerate everyone knows...and thousands thousands us absolutely reason go back. appreciate commitment safety really made good lot promises ensure health wellness employees...

But initial attempt send employees back, successfully working home year half tells there's old white men charge think success comes enough butts seats earn giant bonuses. 

I interested see progresses! BIL moved office job full remote, moving Ohio Florida, like $30k raise. Needless say it’s worth way factors involved. Yeah, way said masks protect first want run masks would've caused shortage medical professionals really needed them. dishonesty harmed credibility. Unsurprisingly bit echo chamber regard. 


To fair work office need always phone, separate somewhat office life normal life, not? works means, time activities always good. feel this. much lower level spent least 6 weeks covering bosses duties financial year due leave whilst trying job frequently working 1/2 day week OT never able available time lieu claim. sitting tight working company years contract make permanent I'd due severance payment (couldn't fire people keep coming get work done joined Union would field day). Clearly realise I'm taken advantage potentially even far scapegoated perhaps. rainy day fund (haven't time work really since Uni 20+ years ago) got house mortgage payments comfortable. Working home broadly crap fact anti vaxx colleagues I'd keen return Office get normality back. Normality going virtual meeting 5 internal message windows pop expecting dealt like 6 hours meetings 5 hours. found whole part guy Prudential speaking somehow everyone disassociated office, might jump ship.

Once again, companies seem think workers actually give damn company culture, values, BS managers go about. think many managers probably astounded find workers value personal lives company. frankly, management naive think otherwise, I'm almost wondering finding people. 

Someone going jump ship given better hours, money, freedom. company seems feel like way going keep employee forcing cubicle farm open plan hell, breaking spirit pre-pandemic corporate life, prepared lose lot people. That, pray another big economic downturn everybody ends desperate income thus willing take abuse. 

The writing wall. Workers want personal life waste much lives commuting. Parents want able kids rather constantly working. Practically nobody cares company culture make company job passion life.

Stop complaining deal it. Every path leads dystopia X_X /r/UnexpectedCloneReunion Even 99.99% survival rate, there's way hell going join circle jerk 999 people 1 would die. take risk? what? afraid would gain weight stuck home job thanks COVID. Turns out, slowly losing and/or replacing fat muscle. Got set free weights waiting green bar/processing icon, curls exercises. 

The goal able hold wife wall make love, cause wanted try _forever._ Same. company go back unless law again. That's great! Every bit counts. convert offices housing. Problem solved. usual conservative/wsj take scare people. Companies desperately trying offshore jobs last 30 years. could done overseas, would be. Instead, realized offshoring works data entry customer service (and even then, well.) reference NPIs dropped Scotland Aug 9. drugs kids. time get infected, yes. Muh freedom! This. work bank regulation banks going really big loans go really bad soon. didn’t really see last year aid starting run people deciding go back, commercial credits going go bad fast. job harder hey job security higher downturn 😂 Pay, challenge, thirst ? python guys take ruby jobs vice versa? netops go QA... fungible degree. types desire learn totally new shit. 

I really doubt would difficult find someone who'd willing try. course, pay always question. amazing many ""businessmen"" news decrying wfh recently large real estate portfolios.... requirement! also offer testing help mitigate community spread plenty studies focusing age Delta, including focused US, Canadian Israeli population. statement isn’t accurate. Additionally, don’t see can’t extrapolate UK data U.S. Sure, important caveats, you’ll need explain can’t extrapolate all. Didn’t mention banning received 3rd dose Pfizer today four months 2nd dose. autoimmune disease I'm taking immunosupressant medication. inoculations done CVS pharmacy. Except sore shoulder, negative reaction vaccine thus far. knowledge, contracted Covid-19 yet cold flu several years gotten flu vaccine shot year least past 10 years. much better nothing. That's since people can't get vaccine dumb reasons Gainfully employed decent place, genuinely interested market really like map appears report stats every days now, long view data still makes sense. Includes things besides case numbers, another topic, could agree this.

Every major country approved vaccines. like hard find right info. 3 second Google search.

If see still refuse acknowledge, continue believe vaccines chips etc instead relying actual organizations, thats brain washed anymore. Even fox News pushing vaccination point. still extremely effective against…

Yes Leave NASCAR I'm worried science answers. I'm worried unvaccinated listen science screw rest us. copypasted talking point 2020. OMG U WNT LOCKDOWN BRO???

Only pro-pandemic politicians driving us toward lockdowns. sad, hopefully recover soon. Delta really joke problem studies “long-Covid” formal definition it, study use whatever definition want define it. lot people equating lingering symptoms debilitating long-term effects. cases that’s true, Israeli study looked symptoms basically. That’s uncommon viruses general. need get lot better defining mean “long-COVID” grouping someone scratchy throat two weeks recovery someone chronic organ damage insane. Unfortunately, people hear 10-20% patients experience “long-COVID” mind goes directly latter, former. Oh yes: hoping could quit sub covid trending covid unit zero patients 3 weeks back May. August, summer month normally census low. Instead unit back capacity 32 covid patients. sucks. really never end jack asses get friggin vaccine. Perhaps CDC shouldn’t stopped collecting data breakthrough cases back May... kind introspection long countries usa regard 'third world' beaten pandemic. new recommendation immunocompromised third dose 4 weeks second dose, past that.

 
The 8 month booster planned everyone else. like people annoyed AF unvaxxed crowd mad CDC publishes new guidance less protect unvaxxed crowd expense vax crowd. They're even wrong Really they're mad everyone prolonging nightmare CDC getting shoot messenger treatment. kids get vaxxed rest idiots go Darwinned.  TLDR: open windows. Study modeling study only, see paper discussion here: I’m nervous. 

My mom brother traveling Kentucky weekend bury grandfather. Even though they’re vaccinated, they’re terrified catching anti-maskers anti-vaxx family. We’ve tried get funeral home order mask mandate don’t know obeyed. 

I hate this. still many susceptible people. Scotland 380,000 confirmed covid cases. generous assume 2/3 cases missed little 1 million people infected. population Scotland 5.5 million. Therefore 80% people infected covid. Many people vaccinated considering breakthrough infections increased high community spread, many vaccinated people catch covid unless people vaccinated. probably need least 80% people fully vaccinated prevent big surges cases.  sad. Condolences family. Mission Accomplished imagine anyone vaccinated point would assume non-severe symptoms cold/flu wouldn’t bother getting tested (even though covid likely, know illogical antivaxxers be), whereas symptoms breakthrough case would prompt person get tested. data test positivity rate higher among unvaccinated vaccinated? headline make anti vax idiots want even lmao That’s already happening it’s enough. 100% right. cousin Tampa doctor found Covid, thankfully less symptomatic can’t go back hospital 2-3 weeks, multiply situation 100s times across country boom huge healthcare worker shortage......  guys followed directions idea life would go something resembling pre-01/01/2020 normal. Turns out…you’re perpetual danger (extra high July 15 May 1 following year) thanks variants society can’t deal face masks.”

The CDC also culprit. gave poor guidance least twice. First telling people Spring 2020 masks dont work, damaged public perception masks. prematurely giving people false sense security Summer 2021 suggesting vaccinated effectively immune, negligible transmission vector, advised opened everything 70% vaccination threshold even closed reached (fact: USA even 60% right now). 

Fauci blame delta variant wants threat highly transmissible variants delta variant well know time decision drop mask mandate. Yeah doses meant 1000lb horses people using ending poison control. even slumming it. Japan Taiwan way nicer US unless already upper middle class. 8000 people die US day. know figure countries vaccinations. Statistically, hundreds millions people getting vaccinated, going die soon vaccinated. mean anything vaccination.

A non-zero number 8000 deaths day watched Tucker Carlson evening before. Perhaps needs investigated,. Wow hospitalized. hope go home safely soon. Stay safe everyone mom 77, one first county get vaccine. know 8 months first vaccine 2 weeks second. Yes. People act Delta different virus. isn’t. greater share spike proteins activated grip onto cells. meant requires antibodies neutralize. spike hasn’t changed much. Boosters work great delta increase antibody levels tremendously. heard, think ""parasite virus"", whatever means. Send way second.  Racism absolutely nothing it. supply constraint vaccines. Getting vaccinated significantly boost protection. Go it! said

Gonna need cite sources, friend. one who's following situation UK delusion Delta simply ""gone away."" happen UK's vaccinations provided counter Delta, counter otherwise may happened vaccinations measures. reality COVID gradually becoming endemic illness means cases may come cases may go different points time. 

Plus, booster program way provide extra protection fall/winter surges. “Freedom shots” That's good point. wash though terms efficacy calculation, assume rate previous infection vaxxed unvaxxed? extra context fact still active heated debate IVM scientific community. It’s settled matter. main worry give children bogus cures hurt help… no, can’t justify giving :(  Hope husband better soon  OK, maybe believe CDC, may believe doctor. asked her? 96% doctors vaccinated June survey. may believe 50 physician health professional organizations jointly signed letter healthcare workers trust one organizations. can't conspiracy. Data suggesting lethal too.  Israeli study, think discount people get COVID.

Why not? study Alpha, already know vaccines far effective preventing transmission now. good basis drawing conclusions Delta.

Glad hear safe school kids vaxxed, sorry hear kids' school right thing, seems. right, sense worrying things can't control.   need read more. “know” breakthrough cases everywhere relying anecdotes. Anecdotes amplified social media.  federal gov nothing. mean nothing. advised last year buy vaccines available. backed AZ another one work. rich country could given away vaccines surplus. cost lockdowns far outweighed cost buying every vaccines giving ones need away. fed gov problem, mostly Murdoch owned press problem. Don’t give up. lose weight probably lower BP also exercise get diabetes control. brother dumber today got covid

It possible damaged parts brain well, part responsible taste part responsible higher thought.  everyone lucky, though, especially you’re older underlying conditions. Many older people told, months ago, fully vaccinated could essentially get back normal. did, pay attention every bit news don’t realize Delta changed things. Wanting know current risk infections- minor sever- Delta isn’t asking lot. CDC, days ago admitted boosters necessary, kept rehashing outdated metrics breakthrough infections rare. used be, common. 3,400? Oh, need - 86 year old mom COPD niece already immunocompromised kidney/liver transplant. Even cold mess blood chemistry, causing brain organ damage. vaccinated still vulnerable, mom rapidly approaching 8 month mark. transparency better presentation data would really helpful. :| Yeah definitely agree It’s true though. data can’t keep delta KNOW breakthrough cases everywhere. wait data confirm it. Ugh. coagulation problems covid cause, think really bad policy people going surgery... clinically useful information checking antibody level knowing infection. vaccinated, need get vaccinated regardless test result. vaccinated, infection gave another boost immune system (which lot antibody levels). I'd half population refusing vaccination overrunning hospitals, people would less eager get third shot. Something done get RT one half population unvaccinated half vaccinated, highly vulnerable infection recipe vaccine-evading mutants. kind like hiv treatment. use one treatment, virus well quickly adapt. Three treatments works far better.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Ding ding ding. exactly I’m worried about. people worried before. High risk vulnerable. One problem math control unvaccinated who've covid already. this, estimated efficacy can't compared efficacy numbers vaccine trials, ensured participants covid naive start trial. easy get wrapped things like whether peer reviewed affects ""good"" bacteria. ""clinical significance"" aka actually matter... guess probably appreciable extent evidence suggests oral exposure dominant mechanism covid contagion. 

Similar bleach wipes uv rays, fire. Yes things inactivate covid matter... word, linked actually shown promising results fighting SARS-CoV-2 Taiwan numba 1 disagree clickbait. actually think needs said. data yet people faring vaccinations era delta. studies either UK (can’t compare US) predate delta. article:

CHICAGO (AP) — Rev. Jesse Jackson, famed civil rights leader two-time presidential candidate, wife, Jacqueline, hospitalized testing positive COVID-19, according statement Saturday. 
Jesse Jackson, 79, vaccinated virus received first dose January publicized event urged others receive inoculation soon possible. wife, 77, treated Northwestern Memorial Hospital Chicago. 
“Doctors currently monitoring condition both,” according statement Jesse Jackson’s nonprofit, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 
“There updates time,” statement said. “We provide updates become available.” 
A protégé Rev. Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson key guiding modern civil rights movement numerous issues, including voting rights. 
Despite diagnosed Parkinson’s disease, Jackson remained active, advocated COVID-19 vaccines Black people, lag behind white people United States’ vaccination drive. Earlier month, arrested outside U.S. Capitol demonstration calling Congress end filibuster order support voting rights.  natural selection work here.

Some people smart enough drink bleach take veterinary medicine.
It's especially stupid time around think people would remember people died taking fish medicine earlier pandemic. CDC last reduces infection, reduces shedding-- fewer people infected fewer people potential transmit virus. 

There many studies- search forCovid vaccine effectiveness asymptomatic infection. earlier studies showing 90% effectiveness preventing asymptomatic infection (pre-delta) basis CDC saying vaccinated people longer needed mask- unlikely infected unlikely shed virus. changed delta matter degree, completely. anything Federal government doing? understanding get vaccine anywhere? waiting etc?  Sorry, might dense -- actually saying think long covid real sarcastic?  Maybe start caring idiots?
That's idea, morons. think 100% right - pretty clear ask body already fighting active infection. 1. really, barely felt it, FAST.

2. needle TINY, smallest second smallest made. 

3. Tell person who's giving shot afraid needles. They'll know do. feel bad embarrassed afraid needles, super common.

4. great. feel better shot. Wilburrrrrr. Japan's explosion happened soon majority athletes came in....there hundreds infections, even para Olympics 5 days open 100 cases related it. say would happened rate without Olympics questionable. wanted vaccine

I keep seeing thing types articles always wonder, people really know vaccine it’s for?  one got money back banned spectators. got spectators money still. Sadly based two studies aware of, vaccine prevention long covid either nothing, halves risk. Lots limitations studies, hopefully we'll get better data soon. Vaccines required school sports twenty-five students spend hour one room least six classes everyday? Exactly. heard word mouth, people asked thoughts since knew germaphobe. always shrugged since across entire ocean already locking travel US...a couple weeks later get first victim US...which spiraled control there. sounds like can’t spread though? interfere put someone full length virus? Don’t loose third annual income homie. vaxxed, you’ll okay. article states doctors heading cards there’s evidence article whatsoever doctors  think question asking knew specifically person infected me, place got infected. response didn’t, living life normally. Hence, could contracted places….  likely bots last thread commented sub.

The OP thread posted news article erroneous assertion trying pass academic paper. vaccinated January. great uncle age, vaccinated around time. Died breakthrough infection week ago.

Hopefully recover, snaps people idea breakthrough infections rare. idea they're rare many caveats functionally untrue, chief among waning efficacy.

Please think grandparents. They're safe. Right? Vaccines threaten magic spells miraculous elixirs now, people need know silver bullet virus. Controlled border, I'd agree screening isolation sounds like life pretty normal. sure? annual flu shot require whole process drug safety trials? Yeah, um, not? thoughts, thoughts prayers. Answer: 

Get vaccinated, determine risk profile tolerance, consider isolated options prefer, respect around (as well local mandates norms) travel.

The answer since vaccinations became widely available continue same, even risk profile may constantly evolving. headlines seem designed clickbait artists want stoke hostility. Wow! Thanks info. make appointment local Costco get booster done. really appreciate it!   Wow there’s 250 new cases county east coast us last week, terms vaccination rates. 75% adults fully vaccinated. Seems like NZ shit together 42 49, wanted vaccine admitted hospital. Pretty sad.

Anecdotes work, evidence work - there's lot hand waving misinformation goes unchallenged, collectively educate, provide carrot stick, go forever shrug. Exhausting.  They're entertainment, according lawyers reasonable person believe them. flu updated vaccine takes months approval. would take 9-12? 

When vaccine came out, one mRNA selling points modifying variant would minimal amount work? Sure (we're talking graph page 11)!

Let's look blue lines, fully vaxxed people, stick left graph (all ages) simplicity.

For top three items, Hospitalization, reported symptoms, symptoms lasting 28 days, closer blue line 0, better. vaccine effect all, odds ratio metrics would 1 (the green vertical line), meaning odds hospitalization regardless vaxxed not. So, look blue lines three metrics, see vaccines reduces odds bad outcomes. also see much better reducing chance hospitalization reducing chances symptoms.

For last metrics, chances asymptomatic infection, away 0, better. showing blue line (vaccinated) twice likely asymptomatic case unvaxxed.

Hope helps -- LMK not. got booster yesterday Costco form fill certify eligibility diabetes there. you’re state low vaccination rates pharmacies sitting doses. Whoa Kinda makes sense though.  US, H1N1 cruises got rerouted avoid Mexico, Ebola initiated minor health screening. MERS mad SARS didn’t impact basic US living either. Covid19 completely different ballgame. understand, CDC stopped collecting breakthrough data quite back, I'm sure accurate is.

Not enough people vaccinated mix-and-match significantly affect rates - might make 5% difference, even seems unlikely.

Nearly us waited 4 months doses, however, IIRC studies done indicated resulted better overall protection line.

ETA: catching covid presents risks like long covid, organ damage, like, know well vaccines protect that, seeing vaccinated people ~1/100 likely wind hospital catch covid, ~1/1000 likely wind ICU.

So there's good reason hope vaccines similarly helpful long covid organ damage well, so, main concern low efficacy high enough arrest spread covid, good odds coming infection without much ado. even apply. got booster yesterday said same. moderna, first shot got really sore arm days. second shot felt really sick day like aches, chills, hot, fatigue, third day woke fine. third shot arm swelled it’s really red arm hurts again. course aren’t keen, it’s witch hunt answer acceptable “China”. investigation needs unbiased, unbiased big political figures already screaming China.

I don’t think ever point finger accepted all. Good thing data instead ""beliefs"", data shows 50-80% efficacy symptomatic infection 90%+ efficacy hospitlization. There’s nothing vaccine covid doesn’t have.

There’s mercury. Antivaxxers fixated years.  read it. cure stupidity assholery, always worried ""It's fair"" whiny title. benefit vaccinate much world possible reduce creation spread variants. problem running around playing world police tasked increasing production distribution vaccines considered "" fair "". flu coming back going hold another winter? Typically confidence intervals like mean confident given data actual reproduction rate falls 0.9 1.2. say let take it. long term mild effects unknown….that’s freaks out.  So... sort good know mother-in-law company? symptoms. anyone idea many others thing? April Facebook allows massive amounts information peculate platform killing people.

No one seems concerned everyone stays platform anyways.

Facebook continues Facebook. know Illinois least, vaccinated deaths around 3.1% deaths covid since January 2021 according state health department. think got it? think Canada's choice extend interval doses, mix-and-match, ended paying given know now. large Mayo Clinic study came recently US showing ~50% efficacy Pfizer. science issue much policy now. Science done part. Enhanced *lot* according article. order magnitude more, variants well, noted within.

What wonder whether booster shots something similar. Fuck people. Pull license 2300 know help understand “Odds Ratio” axis UK report page 10? Can’t figure misinformation spreading? peer-reviewed article. Honestly curious. something wrong source I'll gladly remove it. I'm vaxxed support everyone getting vaccinated find multiple ways combat covid see issue that. Hope add small bell know avoid.  Korea help ? I’m twice vaccinated still got it. fairly hard time firmly believe outcome would much worse vaccinated April. hpercar? missing normal car? want optimistic, let's face it, people stupid. can't fix stupid.

lordy lordy, want go bar get shot get clap. hiding like hermit semblance consistency covid guidance. unfamiliar “The Economist”, high quality source excellent journalism. stats need context. Everyone freaking “long COVID” universal definition it. Persisting symptoms recovery uncommon among viruses. need stop grouping sore throat two weeks chronic organ damage. 10-20% stat includes things. People need realize 10-20% COVID-19 debilitated. need much better job explaining nuances “long-COVID”.  Yeah, vaccinated person, starting make think vaccines work shitty. :/ I'm supposed get booster shot. vaccine effective COVID first released delta, would celebrating. People gotten really used 95% efficacy anything 50% considered effective. current data indicates efficacy 85-90% Delta population predominately vaccinated Pfizer.

10% R0 6 0.6. 15% 0.9.

So actually effective enough, barely - need 90% population vaccinated stop covid current efficacy rate. don’t think issue America supply, think issue demand.  Stop spreading healthcare misinformation. hurting people. keep this. 20%of COVID deaths Louisiana last week fully vaccinated. Check state dashboard. article published Science Israel 60 % hospitalized COVID patients fully vaccinated. worse initially thought. rates we're seeing Canada 85-90% effective Delta. We're predominately Pfizer vaxxed, good number people AZ Moderna vaccines. US population 6 times large England’s. Ergo, it’s likely rare occurrence would take place US Ingerland.  also required vaccinated dozen regular schedule vaccines immigrants must Let cruise, forever ever depart dock. someone sick boat, it’s going spread like wildfire. It’s literal floating Petri dish. 

Wait out. Go fancy little trip it’s safer world back “normal” way life. data I'm getting alberta + ontario vaccine makes you:
 - 1/10 likely catch covid first place
 - 1/100 likely end hospital
 - 1/1000 likely end ICU

So currently healthy, 1/1000th likely wind hospital unvaxxed person next you. odds ending ICU 10 thousand times smaller theirs. part socialize anyone unvaccinated, except one friend hesitant non-political reasons think he's coming around. 

I fortunate immediate family vaccinated.   Part 1

Sorry caught it, would probably 10x worse without shot. Hope recover quickly! trouble asia, people put community first. US, people worship money themselves, lives, harder. Look al losers… wow!  full article goes detail. Apparently concerned antibody dependent enhancement early on, course, billion vaccinated people haven’t dropping like flies, so, that’s concern. seem taken woo-woo path though. God, echo chamber. Trump's barley time move heads let DeSantis move right in. exponential growth almost every state due delta. Floridians get vaxxed they’ll fine, don’t that’s them. Seems like DeSantis isn’t punishing responsible people protect irresponsible. stupid? wasn’t serious.  way earth 90% infection stat still holds. Hell, 4 vaccinated US Senators got covid month alone (out 100 total). felt really bad Thursday, went Dr Friday rapid test showed positive. feels like bad head cold, except able taste smell anything. get worse expect case? 1. Alpha 	2. Beta 	3. Gamma 	4. Delta 	5. Epsilon 	6. Zeta
7. Eta 	8. Theta 	9. Iota 	10. Kappa 	11. Lambda 	12. Mu

In case anybody cared... able they’re vaccinated. age, he’s extremely lucky, blessed, come ventilator. people age don’t ever recover strength breathe own. Maybe God’s way telling work Earth isn’t done encourage people get vaccinated wear masks.  Montagnier probably say that, also turned homeopathy crackpot 10 years ago one taken seriously since then. Hey all,

I'm locking thread due high number rule breaking comments Anyone provide insight IGG antibody levels mean? 
 
I covid back. done antibody test IGG antibody levels high. 
 
I'm going another antibody test. would results suggest antibody levels still high vs alot lower? 
 
If higher protection covid? 
 
How delta variant affect this, saw antibodies still effective vs delta variant much vs variants, I'm trying figure vaccinate better protection vs delta high IGG antibody level would give good protection 
 
Any input appreciated! One hope  Would date someone gets yearly flu shots well?  vaccinated. want put stupid badge tinder though I'm glad swiped left. Bud, lot people healthy immune systems can't effectively protected. group includes people host different conditions well cancer patients. Luc Montagnier turned antivax, pro-homeopathy crackpot old days. Sadly, degree save seem like mental health issues. wouldn’t cruise now, also moderately immunocompromised physician works kids, COVID. mean, got 3rd shot last week I’m careful going anywhere else indoors much work grocery store past certain point I’m going never live either, chances much higher it’ll something work that’ll endanger me. I’m early 40s. worry; stay fuck away you. lot people want chemotherapy mostly it'd likely kill super painful process can't imagine looks like COVID deaths now...

But funeral pyres dumping bodies river part culture long time  think that's day ends India. problem delta variant different antibodies don’t recognize - it’s delta mutant produces much virus overwhelms system. 

Let’s say beginning vaccination 1000x many antibodies needed ancestral strain. Alpha reduces effectiveness like 3x, means still 300x many antibodies needed. 

The problem delta it’s producing 1000 times much virus ancestral strains. Honestly, probably mostly people comorbidities. 70% Americans overweight obese men elevated risk heart disease.

The word 'comorbidity' stops mean anything covers everyone 40, overweight, man. feel like every time ask someone who's like anti-axine want take vaccine asked like main reasons every single one know given reasons completely false even like real blank Facebook really blame Facebook Fox News dangerous politicians really trying political careers playing lives people voting them. like people believe governor news they're watching supposed historically trustworthy sources get information right they're disservice people know reality going play favor, dangerous irresponsible really people need stopped know else stop spread misinformation. Fox News really endangering lives people watch spreading like blatant misinformation stories dangerous vaccine fucking great stops getting hooked ventilator dying yeah might wear fuck I'd rather take vaccine end know dying. literally know people smoke cigarettes drink alcohol want take vaccine cuz worried what's it. Like even happen North America know vaccines aplenty anybody wants one instead Us opening back able like type normal got fucking idiots running around screaming freedom keeping us lock even longer even make sense. Like way we're headed hope Netflix better shows winter. know there's 8 active cases right? is, they're worth it. Also, FYI, men COVID without vaccine higher likelyhood sterile and/or erectile dysfunction. No, I’m saying it’s zero sum game. Furthermore greater limiting factor distribution lower income nations. Cool. hope rest maskholes also resign. 120,000 given dose virus successfully deactivated, something like 40,000 ended mild form polio, hundred ended paralyzed, handful died. 

I'm pro vaxx come, facts facts. Well triage goes likely benefit treatments vaccinated people likely politics aside you’re vaccinated need treatment you’re likely get unvaccinated person. 🤷‍♀️ visited Silverwood weeks back.

I saw people wearing 20 different variations US Flag clothes.

Do people think wear flag, vacuum-sucked space something? Reading comment, figured real test would whether would consistently correctly conjugate incorrect word. think would, right. think majority comes fact grandfather passed away couple days weeks getting vaccine (I can't remember) blamed vaccine. sucked, frail 98 year old dementia lived nursing home. thing COVID mitigation measures work properly keep people getting sick, ends seeming like overreaction people one got sick. people states properly addressing pandemic spared worst drawn Abbott DeSantis promises ""freedom"" never saw firsthand ""freedom"" actually entails. experienced ~~minor inconvenience~~ brutal oppression things like masking.

People work familiar paradox. ""Nothing ever breaks, paying for?"" world ignored everything happening there. I, layperson following since January 2020 knew going terrible, there's ZERO reason countries prepared. least died free man!  wonder many conspiracy theorists traveled much. 

Don't get impossible would worldwide conspiracy made people races, religions, countries? comorbidities. CDC saying. us, vaccine efficacy basically paper thin. coin toss whether end severe illness and/or death.  insidious thing obesity epidemic. person judges body appear 'normal' they'll tend assume healthy. Something like 70% Americans overweight obese. lot Americans know healthy body looks like. They'll assume overweight healthy, normal, in-shape super healthy.

It’s ones fault think otherwise. fine, wash hands thoroughly, mask touch face washing hands.

Here’s article boosters // here’s CDC site ""I trust doctor, horse's vet though..."" old point shorter interval basically one vaxx double dose.

I personally think 3-shot approach best. Second shot 3-4 weeks first, 3rd shot 6 months 2nd.

6 months arbitrarily chosen based vaguely recall estimated time protection starts falling off. absolutely agree you! many measures take help protect populace. focus external factors vaccine masking important; however, factors involved increase chance positive outcome infected ignored. possess several co-morbidities Diabetes, high blood pressure immunodeficiency. incredibly vigilant eating healthy diet, exercising keeping strict control blood sugar. measures, along getting adequate sleep, taking medication prescribed, etc going improve chances infected. focus many actions take control would help everyone physically, would help restore strength resilience mentally. long term effects take one month adjust it.(July August) 

They saying going likely trial 6 months see works variant, that's would take Q2. 

August, in, Q3 2021. Testing 6 months would Q4 Q1 2022. release Q2 got backwards... got Pfizer May far I’ve ok. I’m taking social distancing thing seriously , hardly go except important things groceries. I’m nervous contracting even though wear mask every time. go back school week though so…welp. Sure, before, people would tell Hippocratic Oath, must treat everyone equally regardless vaccination status, blah blah blah. 

Now : ""we sick tired antivaxxers flooding hospitals, best luck them"" would expect follow [logistic exponential curve. logistic curve often used model population growth given finite amount food/space/hosts/etc. exponential curve would assume enough resources support infinite population, obviously true. Neeeeigh! Trump always symptom.

Or start article : vaccinated people 0.02% ended hospitalised 2021. Talk useless information.

Thus far, risks seem too...speculative? really hardly studies it; one know (the Israeli health care study) sample 39 breakthrough cases; studies long-COVID general seem use incredibly broad array symptoms identify (some serious, not).

Luckily dad even beat COVID month brain cancer got him. Breezed right it. tough old guy. 

The people get staff, wearing N95s. knew right there. flimsy surgical masks homemade cloth masks nothing make us feel false sense security. First responders probably means cops. Cops la want vaccines masks want huge funeral articles written papers.  I’m like get toddler vaccinated first. Got carded SF today breakfast. Good. months since I've seen person wearing mask should. look county numbers, show it. Yes, infections rising (delta anyone?) hospitalizations deaths damn near flat. Well Australia vaccinating rate faster USA UK ever reached, it’s getting better. Plague Inc needs add news.  replying top comment lol Australia longer aiming covid zero. governments trying suppress cases long possible enable maximum vaccination rates. There’s difference. couple Australian states (out 8 states territories) still aiming covid zero eventually forced give this.

Make optional. way one left behind still lot fewer pupils per classroom Covid excuse always wanted  happens elsewhere. alpha variant, yeah. 

Against delta too, feel like gap effectiveness between, example, Pfizer Sinopharm lot smaller variant. Anecdotally, countries mostly used Sinopharm vaccinate experiencing outbreak moment (UAE, Bahrain, Chile...), UK, USA, Iceland Israel experiencing outbreaks, trending upwards.

**Before Chinese bot, decided take Pfizer booster instead 3rd dose Sinopharm**, feel still better vaccine. However, feel vaccine constantly discredited, even though saved many lives. vaccinated 6 months now, ~5 direct contacts infected people (2 delta peak timeframe), countless events, gotten infected all. Np. 1 working day. Yep, wish would traumatize anyone decides go outside time. Get 2nd opinion? Would bit ironic straight dead mouse. least try smelling stuff seeing smell happens elsewhere. Admit it: it’s exciting see variant coming next, sort like speculating happen book movie series. /s

These guys probably write Covid fanfic spare time.

Edit: added /s case  kind people stand 2 fucking inches trying fix something scream wrong.  brilliant. Thank you! MIL shared article priest saying cure. several risk factors get vaccinated. doctor. expect give body something else react learn fight, probably help fight covid. may make covid worse body would distracted. recover well protected future though! Actually, yeah. go worries. mentioned stuck home work trying alert positive antibody test would necessarily mean active infection. trying helpful, trying argue.

If physician access uptodate, look covid-19: diagnosis page confirm said, snippet serologic identify prior/late infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood, adequately validated help identify patients previously SARS-CoV-2 infection well patients current infection symptoms three four weeks (table 3). serologic tests less likely reactive first several days weeks infection, limited utility diagnosis acute setting [34,89,90]. Checking serology three four weeks onset symptoms optimizes accuracy testing, since test sensitivity beyond five weeks uncertain [28]. mandates come post full approval make biggest difference. mostly agree due large amount liars (also better masks enforced concept personal protection source control.) definitely something would vary place place, areas high transmission it’s definitely necessary. Got vaxxed friend south pretty sick covid last heard, hope she’s better now.  That’s vaccine works. It’s 90% agains infection, death. It’s like 99%+ death. That’s point vaccine. Also like someone else said, source numbers.  much nursing shortage vs available space? 7-day rolling average cases risen 10% last week, implying R(t)~1.056 4-day serial heat waves caused people spend time indoors a/c maybe? Whining freedom, accepting bailouts fed. Lol Live Florida antivax family I’m fucked I'd like read article, page nope.  Great question! Sinopharm vaccine like smallpox, polio, measles vaccines. Sinopharm vaccine dead coronavirus, killed used chemical treatment. called inactivated virus vaccine. inactivated coronaviruses vaccine longer replicate. type vaccine like first polio vaccine (invented Jonas Salk). (The second polio vaccine, made Sabin, live, weakened virus). 

Inactivated virus vaccines seem pretty good job training immune system. best vaccines live viruses replicate cells, like vaccines smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio (Sabin version). 

It unlikely Sinopharm going give longer lasting immunity, coronaviruses seem give life long immunity general. I'm never getting tested covid choice.  Please provide evidence statement. Probably probability.  They’ve already approved severely immunocompromised two days ago announced booster shots rolling general public around September 20th. It’s extremely likely they’ll approve at-risk population then.  Nah me. fail problem. Since problem solves bigger problem. t's body, interest sleeping hundreds people? choice.

Allllll good! Exactly. long suspected masking offer protection, universal masking rendered useless cases real world application. People go bars, clubs, restaurants, movie theaters. What’s first thing do? remove masks. I’ve seen time time again. first wave, suspect wasn’t masking alone prevented spread capacity limits lockdowns combined masking prevented spread. Right now, universal masking nothing theater without capacity restrictions.

There studies seen yet address reality. hell thus info spread.

Heart rate uncontrollably high rest would also consideration. “A coalition groups including medical professionals, first responders, parents students gathered Santa Monica Saturday protest Los Angeles' impending COVID-19 vaccine mandate, saying segregate city, breed hate violate rights tens thousands people.”

So tiring reading stories like this… Provided *the reason* isn’t protected category.

You disenroll someone minority valid reason, long apply rule uniformly.

If disenroll everyone that’s unvaccinated specific races, religions, gender, etc, it’s fine.

That said, set people unvaccinated predominantly protected category it’s whole different worms. article headlines ever expected see worldwide pandemic, suppose Great response kid Apparently people enjoying pandemic burden medical system.  Florida something special… It’s simply truth. People need accept it. bewilders well. I've worked Healthcare recruitment know one company require workers updated vaccinations. seems like common sense. point is, take vaccine specifically made target covid, take drug something entirely irrelevant virus. boggles mind; practically spitting image I'd swear adopted lol makes big difference fight it, spread, ends. 1918 also clear modern timeline us compete assholes whole wave half finally buckling down, proving always idiots collectively. … DonT even know begin combat inaccuracies comment. Lol. nice Saturday  Special corpse munching catfish? WTF 😞 freedom right /s Se supone que no... Acorde al gobierno, por lo menos. La que sí tuvimos fue la variante gamma parece, la P1, que fue bastante peor que el covid original, este año tuvimos un montón de casos muertes hasta ahora en junio que comenzó un dramático descenso. 

Y qué tal, tienen síntomas muy fuertes? La verdad conozco muy pocos casos de conocidos con covid, los que han tenido (sin vacuna) ha sido fiebre fuerte por unos 3 días. Los vacunados conocidos solo han tenido tos. lot *really* fucking dumb nurses. 1 4 seems high, entirely shocked accurate.   buddy work, late 40's, obese, smoker, type 1 diabetic, triple bypass heart surgery 4 years ago.

This, course, doesn’t apply CAN’T get vaccinated medical reasons that’s case case basis whether I’d wanna get involved.  delta too, feel like gap effectiveness between, example, Pfizer Sinopharm lot smaller variant.

How know? China provide lack detailed data Chinese vaccines Delta hobbled meaningful peer reviews foreign countries mostly used Sinopharm vaccinate experiencing outbreak moment (UAE, Bahrain, Chile...)

From reported record daily cases recently due surge Delta variant, saw hundreds medical workers infected COVID-19 despite vaccinated Sinovac's shot, officials said earlier month. good news many people got infected quarantined event, weeks later cases dropped. Everyone got infected time. think time deny anyone chosen get vaccinated yet. Give doses countries help fight variants.

Pues quiero ser agorera pero aun con altos porcentajes de vacunación, la Delta es súper contagiosa. créeme, sé de lo que hablo, en este momento tengo dos amigos positivos mi marido mi hija en cuarentena, salvo mi hija estamos todos vacunados.
Con la vacuna hay muchas menos muertes/caso, pero como el número absoluto de casos se dispara, al final el total de muertes también acaba aumentando. guess mask mandates reduce spread, like you, doubts they're particularly efficacious. one study Denmark find effect, pretty statistically underpowered look impact masking source control, interesting data point, think read much it.

 
One thing I'm excited about: RCT masking come next days Bangladesh. iirc, actually uses clustered randomized approach, get better sense masks' impact transmission.

Source: [CDC vaccination demographic Excludes Texas (\~9% US). replied comment another thread someone mentality.

He's worried vaccine risky potentially underlying health condition related heart perfectly happy take chances COVID-19 kills 10% people pre-existing cardiovascular disease contract it. Literally, W-T-F I’m hugely pro vaccine it’s absolutely insane you’re downvoted this. Unvaccinated young people extremely unlikely die Covid. Extremely unlikely. mean need protect inept? duty humanity maybe get testing determine antibody level understand needs booster get data. Giving everyone bit overkill. really need follow Canada’s lead restrict travel vaccinated. 

I thiiink JNJ shelf/temperature stable.. prefer blame surge blame belongs: refused vaccine, went public never pandemic.

I don’t blame CDC unable navigate society full many idiots real time. Hindsight 20/20, didn’t need hindsight know you’re unvaccinated, probably shouldn’t go live life pretending are. said doesn’t stop viral shedding whatsoever? Hospital resources stretched absolute limits right now. would shocked anyone administered precautionary observation.

I think highly likely condition requires hospitalization.  FDA political pressure approve vaccine. I've already heard couple dipshits know. one know vaccine melissa joan hart get? since experiencing breakthrough case, curious flavor vaccine received, IE. MRNA based (Pfizer Moderna) one, traditional one like (J&amp;J)? lives exposed sorts things statistically dangerous getting COVID vaccinated. 

Examples? 

Vaxxed people ""freaking fuck out"" probably worried dying ending hospital: probably, rightfully so, trying avoid long covid.  looking someone actually date industry now. Everyone flaming shit cruise lines, reality COVID standards stricter 99% events employers there. Environmental concerns different argument.

Have great time! parents going one next week told precautions felt much, much better going.  go? GF got moderna soon could. effects wear off? mutation resistance thing? like taking cruises.


I get cruise ship paid me.  Yeah, can. could guessed exactly would happen. CDC made bad call.  Black people higher risk complications COVID-19 due low Vitamin levels people fair skinned. 

There reports related last year, people &amp; MSM simply forgot it. 😐 mono 2019. Took 2 months stop coughing, trouble swollen lymph nodes 1.5 years afterwards. Gotta love people's 👃 hanging out. Effing pisses off, might well take damn thing off. sub reading many headlines person. talk boosters, I’m really sure point. It’s anecdotal breakthrough cases way common people stating. know quite fully vaccinated people COVID right now. Thanks! saw those, seem suggest people 60 need boosters. think great news world whole can't even get people take 2 US world still lacking first doses. curious something popping commonly lately. lot people talking vaccinations cause mutations due breakthrough infections logic makes bit sense except fact variant concern popped either vaccination rollouts areas exceptionally low vaccination rates time. makes absolutely sense me. case? general understanding stuff eludes me. Vaccinated less likely get infection infection shorter. likely. viral load sick thats exactly same. 

It's smaller window smaller odds. can’t though. specific shelf life shipped specific conditions. also need available still getting vaccinated.

Multiple countries boosters. end year, expect see much Europe pushing boosters too.

Yeah, think send countries too, protection continues wane vaccination half country completely inept, need try prevent spread best can. US can’t help countries medical systems completely overrun. There’s little thing called planning though Anecdotal evidence bueno   I'm vaccinated maybe feeling hopeless point, I've reading lots vaccinated people able spread it. apologize comment incorrect, understanding. vaccine roll slow beginning many people also quite complacent minimal cases. half Aussies 16 least one vaccine dose rate vaccinations per capita one highest world per day. sooner vaccinated sooner lockdowns ease. Pretty much point pandemic needed ECMO, unlikely get it. They’re never going enforce unfortunately. case seen (incidence rate vaxxed vs unvaxxed, *think* July sure): also publishes, weekly Thursdays, cases per 100K two populations (click Breakthrough top right page load scroll mid page): publicity event.  can't fix many stunted kids, kids very, low chance dying unless underlying issue, IFR 0.002% 2/100k. reference I, IFR 10 times that, bottom risk calculator 1 million chance death COVID 3 month peak. Wasnt bad call. time, anti Vaxxers saying “why get vaccinated I’ll still wear mask.” effort appease dildos, CDC said “fine you’re vaccinated won’t wear mask.”

You think people went got vaccinated? course not. pretended like pandemic over, tossed masks went public like 2018 again. Can’t blame CDC fucking stupidity. I’m fortunate live country less 1% infected. think I’ll good.  Selfish af. ship lol, sure mean. go waste demand gone. continue wasted. Covid challenging capitalism interesting ways flu season coming expect bigger clusterfuck testing companies literally destroying tests due yolo summer optimism leading expect lower demand. times, time think CDC right? could something good world no. Americans gon murika.  Breaking news: disinfecting sinuses oral cavity fire found kill virus responsible COVID-19 🙄    Sent! nope. that’s part two problem part one doesn’t work covid. side coin set failure (in messaging least) going back acting like everything normal knew least likely keep masking also least likely vaccinated, 50% total population vaccinated. option 12. 

The vaccines working well, need rolled further, can't act like getting one magic forcefield. We've got keep mitigation measures need instead away get tired them.  forget pour version. Mix apple sauce sweet feed, ponies fight it. Oh gee maybe risk people still risk. There’s also complexity defining “works” trying figure masks “work.”

For example, anecdotal experience: girlfriend works bar, December came vicious case Covid. Hospitalized 10 days, double pneumonia etc.

Anyway, bar time, nobody actually wearing masks. one. realized fever, put mask house kept on. even drove get tested waited car hacking lungs 2 hours. 

Anyway, end getting infected, extremely mild case. lost sense taste smell that’s far symptoms went. Maybe mask nothing it, I’m fairly certain even know masks didn’t keep becoming infected, personally believe masks reduced exposure enough case generally mild.

Now I’m telling anyone take word medical proof. point is, although masks may prevent infection, it’s possible minimize severity.  know sure, shouldn’t go around saying masks “just theater.” dangerously incorrect information They’re probably trolling tbh Technically vaccine Linda like experiment. think booster shots quickly? got fish tank cleaner instead.  son vaccinated March also, got Covid last week. tested negative today week headaches, lethargy sore throat. He'll get tested tomorrow. Vaccines work.  percentage vaccinated people? high it?   navy use cruise ships target practice. things floating diseased islands. seeing g country's news worst gutter press. Gdamn outbreak sheer stupidity ignorant fools loose America WTF. 10% mortality struck people
In prime routinely. Spread wise covid vastly worse Spanish flu grim

S. Korea vaccine swap talks Romania: foreign ministry Sounds like people sleeping party, 6am trying find available bed sleeping floor someone gets take spot figuratively die Everybody get COVID one point. mandate masks one point take eat others. So. protect family. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, seems going fine enough. vulnerable fully vaccinated, amount damage caused restrictions definitely outweighs damage done COVID. best vaccinating 1/20th population. Probably lot less account inevitable losses. I'm sure 5% vaccinated stop spread Delta. Mountain dew, medicine, illegal drug. Oh tobacco, ingredients never released companies feels great, join us   balance think overestimating efficacy Delta. would love 90% range evidence studies anecdotal says not. mind, family returned masking distancing start pandemic, even though double vaccinated Moderna. Also, child returning in-person school twelves vaccinated mask mandates place. Maybe cautious would rather err direction one. good look lol Hey there,

Reddit shadowbanned account. Usually due account flagged Reddit's anti-spam system. We, moderators, cannot lift shadowban posts comments make communities may visible unless moderator explicitly approves it.

You request shadowban lifted [the appeals page](/appeal).

I've approved comment visible users. remember short week seemed like cruise ship industry done good. Sadly didn’t happen.  Uhh... not, get new doctor.   Yep, still pretty popular wearing mask week would worried right now? wear one?   would thought started using became one.

I think we're making joke. people extremely afraid needles general. That’s certainly implication here. Must mean children home-schooled, wouldn’t let school without childhood vaccines caught up. Let's keep context mind - narrative wild type (og) variant. goalposts moved scientists actual virus itself. 

The vaccines originally aimed prevent severe disease, ie hospitalization healthcare system overrun even returned normalcy. Sterilizing immunity, less chance transmission, etc essentially bonuses found delta, lot extra layer protection obviously lessened, entirely gone.  Would help people could get refund things like plane tickets government strongly advises traveling said country... /r/nottheonion  Gotcha! makes sense.

Think they're planning Ontario. people get worry less

But get stop worrying. mounting evidence neurological damage occur even asymptomatic cases age, rare.  many people access affordable healthcare? Maybe desperation symptom failing infrastructure.

A large number Americans process dying homes right little help available. vaccinated April.

Shit, too. planning take booster shot, told qualify (autoimmune disease). still Facebook, here’s reason 450,230,000 delete it. i'd like answer  would someone, outside pure moron, decide “hmm, forget proven work free vaccine, I’ll take horse dewormer instead!”???

Like get Fox News nonsense, point folks like use common sense? avoid shot arm?  heartbreaking. could prevented. Poor kids. People really misunderstanding situation here. vaccine's effectiveness **mostly** comes avoiding transmission. However, breakthrough case, chances dying reduced ~2/3 even ~half. Even among vaccinated people variant certainly harmful seasonal flu. 
 
But important thing Delta seems able permeate even fully vaccinated populations. course spread among vaccinated populations half steep huge **spike** we've seen lately among unvaccinated - vaccine surely *slow* transmission - slope still upward direction. means virus *not going away*, *getting worse*. imminent threat like suges we've experienced far, looming problem seem pharmaceutical solution. 
 
Fortunately slope shallow, able push rate transmission &lt;1 generic social distancing like mandatory masking indoor capacity restrictions whatever. people going like this, personally confidence sufficient compliance among population. 
  
----- 
 
 key takeaway vaccinated, mean never take whiff Delta. Yeah curve shallow may get today even months. thing endurance since we've shot nearly pharmaceutical ammo (in medium-term anyway), likely blow past face foreseeable future. data have, likely avoid death long-haul contract it. 
 
That's still serious disease unlike seasonal flu. Actually, individual person needs get vaccine needs rest population get vaccine.   mfs cow sized tho Probably meant effective treatment Covid, there's contenders definitely jackpot prize money company/institute finds good one. tricky disease hopefully manage find one soon No, that's got in. timing align Anti vaxxers: ""You can't prove vaccines safe! refuse take it!""

Also anti vaxxers: ""This horse medicine definitely dangerous humans doses, I'll take instead!"" Italy didn’t even tests beginning, well like 10 test per day capacity result took 3 days so.

They basically measured people rate coming hospital.  100 now. Higher moderna! Well, definitely saving fuel compared hypercar, least there's that. There's also state variability. even state allows it, state may not. think military, wait full authorization require it. there's rumors September date requiring them, right expected full authorization.   vaccine preventing infection, know preventing hospitalization death? fact numbers lower areas higher vaccination rates? That's pretty much happened New Zealand. However, Italy contact tracing infrastructure, vaccines, acquired expertise, public cooperation factors New Zealand currently enjoys. Best Luck. Taiwan managed bring even worse outbreak back complete control, done. They're also required law fully cover (many?) vaccines thanks ACA. Lmao That's weird. I'd estimate half people know say covid point Thank god (not literally), hopefully shut people up. I’m somewhat conservative god stupidity vaccine rage inducing. Tired excuse “I’m waiting FDA approved” individuals never trusted govt orgs before. Get yo vaccine Sounds like data manipulation me.  never likely never wait anything. Holy shit allowed wear mask school? NZ ordered 1.5M Pfizer October. indication ordering point would cost (per dose). need sugarcoat it. Vaccine prices basically irrelevant western nations, anyways. We're allowed link sources sub Trump booed Alabama yesterday telling people get vaccinated.    Lee Memorial Health System reported 12 Covid related deaths one day Thurs. There's way Florida's numbers sre accurate. course. Won’t world same?  children grow up. Something strange scapegoat...think it, airline would LIMOUSINE picking “crew”, either diplomat celeb he’s made scapegoat know, watching old episodes Seinfeld. Kramer sick insisted seeing doctor. Instead, finds dog cough has, heads vet takes medicine. funny joke 90s sitcom turned reality 30 years later. many Kramers America. hotel quarantine. happened NSW year ago almost every symptom books besides lose taste smell shortness breath

Pretty moderate severe cough (roughly bed ridden pneumonia minus pain coughing), fever chills, migraines, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, slight nausea.

Mom lost taste smell took month recover Stay safe there. people took test once. separated people demographic profiles demographic profile, compared average control average looking for. Eg, hospitalized ventilator.

The study shows average, got covid, scored less cognitive tests.

The tests performed vaccine readily available factor. discrepancy probably explained random testing school kids, efficient, asymptomatic spreaders. synchronicity start school cases shooting telling. Happened too, last year. handled properly, Trump could reelection. 

And grandmother wheels would bike Rohan answer.   Paid vacation! still uses facebook? Deleted long ago. know humans going fix global warming. I’m sorry genuinely delusional. plan requires global community spontaneously simultaneously behave delusional really. measure could eliminate poverty war everyone simply agreed nice other. sure you’ve noticed, world work like Yes. careful things alcohol. Even didn’t covid smelling things much would cause lose smell    Even vaccine requires 4 weeks? That's long.

Hey got question guys. antibodies measured. came 111.7 u/ml. I'm almost exactly 6 months second shot (Pfizer), I've never covid. 

I'm curious stacks anyone else who's done test.


And yes know immunity actually comes B cells. Antibodies like ammunition used war soldiers. academic.

Taiwan outbreak delta strain ? two weeks trying die morning commute get vaccinated. Things getting spicy. Long COVID breakthrough cases scares fuck reason I'm super cautious anything. wish people would think this. think slippery slope argument works specific situation. 

If patients beds emergency situation, medical staff going prioritize patients metric. think attitude towards vaccines taken consideration along everything else. 

In non-emergency situations, non-issue. Hospitals treat people diabetes lung cancer time, even conditions essentially self-inflicted. traveled abroad summer in-between period Delta really took off. abroad 2 weeks got tested right trip, twice there, getting back, negative. feel lucky trip planned brief window semi-normalcy. won’t traveling anytime soon. people think they’re still fully protected

This ""fully"" misleading anyways. never 100%. \*sigh\* bother? want thing end, time let Darwin work. months... many stupid people there?

Is someone studying effects average IQ US happening... going easily influenced people die off? harsh, kinds questions circling head.

When enough people die prices plane tickets come due lower demand? Home prices? Gas Price?? want give personal details tanning bed cause blood clots? Roll Tide. Please get vaccinated. this? Lemon drops help wake taste buds patients who’ve gotten radiation mouth, mouth area.
(My uncle experienced nurses said lemon drops worked told neighbor worked too).

Good luck! plan need better mask.  trick watch MLS. problems social distancing. another study researchers found water wet. decision CDC made incentive get people vaccinated, could actually indirect effect getting people incentivized get vaccinated.""


There's Fauci quote. That's bit taking context, straight lied.

Can't find anything Biden. husband nurse. husband wife couple COVID, COVID deniers. husband got taken ICU (and ended dying). wife started worse wheeled ICU yelling COVID COVID real government killing people 🤔😔 I'm convinced accusation us fearful projection. terrifying must think way does. Care back educated answer data? What’s number idle members currently etc. seems like convenient talking point. mean disrespect answer seems easy. would agree seems like don’t get much army. terrible PR. Okay China world fucking leader here... US.

Shit India given doses US. they're developing country.

Get high horse. did, one state state government decided listen lobbyists instead health officers properly. result run away NSW. adjoining states outbreaks lid locked properly beginning. would school kids silently spreading covid young adults without age group contains parents affected? see lot people saying obvious children must big spreaders, see shred evidence data. Man, half country get even stupider. point I'm sure pushing vaccination already idiots point, except going prolong pandemic give virus chances mutate. Schools closed places. Pandemic though, thought everything fine dandy, hell trump gop promised kids can't catch spread covid!

Seriously...nothing happens convince idiots need shape fuck pass kill millions kids potentially end. usual, rules made people sit protected behind desk, immune consequences actions. front line “handle it.” NZ last place terms vaccinations 38 OECD members. Yes, signed contracts. late/too little/too bad, call whatever want. Vaccines limited supply. NZ make mercy whatever deal could make. Every vaccine given somewhere vaccine given elsewhere. 

Supply starting ramp big time NZ rates jabs arms. 1% population jab yesterday. I’ve got believe lack oxygen getting brain probably causing cognitive issues really curious ask family. I've nervous ask Right, doesn’t look worse PR. Oh someone conversation certainly thick brick isn’t me.

More one person thread asked context won’t give it. I'm sure getting numbers. Sweden 80%+ adults first dose(and think assume 2nd dosed weeks time), old country probably translates roughly 70% total population. US 61% one dose slowed lot whereas sweden full steam ahead far. Hawaii open, they've tried hostile it. thick brick. I'm drawing conclusion mislead. still lockdown right? Really? never withdrew approval? Someone throw block sodium pool show antivaxxers never take another single atom bodies. follow consistently wackiness, they'll gone week. fair neither offering accessible testing, completely clear time symptoms look for. tip iceberg. Might toss bit hesitation too.

People don’t get vaccinated don’t think threat. 

My old small town way 50k people 26 covid deaths people still think covid big deal, covid surely wasn’t seen huge threat well NZ dealt it.  ""You horse. cow."" Tell furries. happening like nearly year? fully vaccinated resume activities prior pandemic.

The page linked last reviewed August 13th yet sentence removed modified least. Wtf? Glad hear :D center city beautiful historical landmarks must say, particular outcome Covid-19 - American style bingo card. quarantine leak closed border Australia time. leak appears occurred traveller quarantine became sick transferred hospital. come Google covid numbers (based New York Times data) break numbers county include counties/boroughs NYC? 

It every county state listed, Kings County, Brooklyn, New York City, that's it. 

It's missing Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Richmond (Staten Island). 

It seems arbitrary. Also confusing since New York City technically contains Kings County. Ah yes another per Capita argument pretends country donating 1 mil doses better one 100m country population size large city, ignoring sheer logistics scale handling 100m doses.

Transmission studies happen later, [like entire thread specifically vaccinated people worried chances getting covid may affect them. reasonable question. keep saying evidence. PREP Act specifically covers vaccine applications. medical practitioner held liable willful misconduct typical application vaccine prescribed manner. unfortunately still viewed political scientific regards. FDA: ""Marihuana"" listed Schedule CSA. people study tested after. would predicted people would reject mask wearing taking life saving vaccine? COVID children much less dangerous adults, thus safety threshold vaccine proportionally higher. adults require less than, say, 1 severe adverse reaction per 10 thousand vaccinations, study 30 thousand subjects may sufficient (the actual number severe adverse reactions turned much lower that, couldn’t know vaccines approved).

Now require less 1-in-100,000 severe adverse reactions children, need large trial, maybe 200 thousand subjects.

(All figures illustrative purposes only, although think right order magnitude) bad US yes, anti-vaxxers too. Also vax uptake pretty consistent across regions Canada (we're around 75% single-dosed 65% double-dosed) whereas US dramatic regional differences based politics. political problem political parties support vaxxing; normal run-of-the-mill anti-vaxxers around since forever. course gofundme YouTuber watch really smooth commentary word choices time, tell struggles ease talks camera. Stumbling words, pausing more. Surprising noticable is. Crazy people willing dismiss covid. Ima die use footage TV show, Strain stock footage. Basically vampirism spread via parasitic worms there's plenty worms flying around. get voted mob completely right. People want hear they'd rather whine US donating hundreds millions doses (while also covering many home citizens) instead billions cover guy Zimbabwe. unreasonable countries pay vaccines. They'd rather us pay though. Except said ""Things different now. sucks that’s life.""

These things that, part, really suck. painful changes stuck around.

Masks annoying, going wearing time, forever. Oregon already has... states need follow suit late. Without knowing whole story, don’t think anyone give answer this.  DeSantis criminal Yes. preventative. Multiple doses, side effects, exactly patient friendly - better vs death. 

If medical doctor hundreds people dying around hospital, familiar w/ IVM usage/dosage, see used, see might actually work - even though double/blinded use.

The science behind works fascinating listening people KNOW IVM used really amazing science. Well personally think POTUS America take Jacobson Vs Massachusetts SCOTUS federal case events regarding pandemic. France wish think Americans meddle countries affairs. 

But last two weeks 5 Anti-vaxxers America spewing anti-vaxx BS listening Fucker Carlson died. Sorry adults die unvaccinated sympathy period.

 children age 12 vaccinated sympathy. parents vaccinate children qualify vaccine. child died get vaccinated. shiity foolish parent sterilized. gets me. would issue liability, extent calling someone liability, even exist? came specifically vaccine. also makes curious. ""The vaccine"". I'm tapping one. exposed social media put position place.  Holy fuck, brain cells left? UK becoming new middle East seems thought Australia virus control? happened? wearing masks? definition ad hominem, attacking person instead position. 

I'm asking provide proof claims. Calling ""obsessive"" another ad hominem hopes admit repeatedly lied. evidenced now, don’t care that’s takes. Hopefully Monday changes lot stuff FDA approval, vocal minority people anti-vax sadly keeping thing going. We’ll probably somewhat see-saw state better treatment used comes catch everyone. doubt we’ll ever see another lockdown due taboo (including governors shoot immediately like masks). Friend working someone ended covid, working van together like week. get covid before. isn’t discussed enough

Literally every news outlet discussing this.  proceeded list significant ways life changed lol Oh, hell yes, everyone clapped. hospital CEO personally knelt said, ""Thank you! going name hospital done!"" Governor Abbott gave plaque commemorating accomplishment threw ground pissed front wheelchair (I made sure spray got lifeless legs). that, Mark Cuban personally came Dallas Mavericks nice dinner photo op, funny, Luka Doncic challenged one one game hoops. think realized basically world champion NBA2K1. found dealing broke ankles sick move mine, wide open shot 3, let get back posterized backboard-shattering dunk. Everyone laughed clapped again, hard thought, turned $50 million NBA contract Mark offered me. went ahead gave money anyway impromptu coaching session basically Mavs playing like named Wilt Magic Juice LeBron Jordan.

My name? Albert. Fucking. Einstein.

(Don't confuse inability believe something lack veracity. Reddit easy place lie, absolutely, sniff stuff out. get it. sarcastic lot, undoubtedly misrembered words, hey, believe it, whatever. owe try convince you?) Clots also related adenovirus vaccines. happen flu shots stuff too. seem common mRNA vaccines. Ummm.....what? It’s job.

They don’t numbers.

There many military firemen, trained air craft, shipboard, commercial fires, wild fires.

Same military doctors nurses. sitting around store room somewhere.

They keeping troops healthy clinics hospitals around world, fighting covid hospitals, serving deployments.

So want make situations worse military hospitals double deploy military members certain parts country continue wear masks get vaccinated pretend like there’s pandemic.

Mind bases shut recreational activities cause spread, military get vaccinated, masks required throughout military installations DoD knows little healthcare military bases largely areas currently high community spread (the base hospitals also see great deal family members retirees, community spread double whammy).

No, it’s militaries job destroy healthcare members deploy parts country can’t bothered take pandemic seriously. insane, heartbreaking encouraging time. Hope trend continues there’s unnecessary loss life. life knew likely over. Things different now. sucks that’s life.

Except looking mobility data, restaurant reservation data, travel data, etc. clear majority people already back normal.

Additionally, society experienced *much worse* pandemics past, things people saying never come back came back.

Bars restaurants? Came back!

Hugs? Came back! 

Not sure anyone ever thought going gone forever...

If mean likely limited mask wearing, regionally flu season big covid waves, sure. that's big deal.

If mean remote work. lot people view positive.

And mean become less socially acceptable sick, sure too. objectively good thing. US leas it’s small grocery store. victim, many sources info available opted put entire life hands ones wanted believe. That's victim darwinism Wait, actually true? 80sbabymillennial said. using hypothetical ""take 100 people, 90 vaccinated, 10 unvaccinated"" scenario explain paradox works simple way.

The numbers get example real world medical data. 

In real world, would use hospitalisation data area, coupled vaccination rates area work based figures. feel weird symptoms?

Like feel worryingly sick, OK enough ride home?  Grocery store chain inexplicably seems show every country. environmentally friendly Real slippery slope draw-down managers struggle justify existence without ability lord people office. bosses people? Update - got morning, questions. single shred regret, feeling good far. Consensus I’ve seen 3rd shot reactions tend quite mild. really getting character year [archive link anyone trouble accessing article account vaccinated people likely mask social distance well?

No, strict comparison numbers infected people. correct unvaccinated people also likely engage risky behaviour, much affects rates unknown. hope lose staff. That’s way rigid-thinking management change. mean I’m sorry lose good coworkers though Yeah, understand anyone except petty control freaks would care. 

Because complete paradigm shift office cultures, still running factory assembly line kind outlook.  new, lot people take time shift safe say Australia lost battle zero covid? would get punished work office. remote 10 years. folks would work office, MOSTLY get away spouses, parents office social life. personally hated "" meaningful get together"" aka "" reindeer games"" Foo Fighters put hell show. Go good time. people downvoting want live bomb shelters rest lives. really think many people **feel** productive home, would like see many actually **are** productive. 

It easy notice distractions like ""just throwing landry basket washer I'm bathroom"" ""just watering plants I'm kitchen"" spending little bit longer checking Reddit work day since chance boss walk it.

Commute also seems major selling point work home people like seem abnormally long commutes (excess 2 hours) boggles mind choose live far away work, also never mention kids eat productivity work home. Reminds Prophet Truth Halo. I’m assuming I’m gonna get it, too. school mask mandate vaccines. Full capacity classes. campus last week saw people maskless someone pulled mask talking me.🙄 definitely Joffreys middle management hear? need commute order successfully negotiate boundary work home. something like that. like Hero's Journey working stiffs! obvious people wanting articles written workers... proves R95 masks provide better protection inhaling airborne pesticides solvents. Employers absolutely clueless toll office life takes every aspect existence.

They know, dont care less than. financially worth considering literally cannot operate business. No. I've career 30 years. I've good bad employers. can't keep using 100 year old paradigm dictate work lives. execs use 

Intelligent staff ability self manage. good for? school taking preventive action may help save life 1 student 1,000, don’t bother it’s insignificant statistic? Hell, don’t anything protect kids virus sweeps entire school killing maybe 5 kids 1000, still insignificant survival greater 99% it’s sensationalism! FU! 1 preventable death many. can’t sensationalize enough. 
So tell appropriate reaction that’s “proportional” result?  There’s always central/eastern Washington. (Though places aren’t quite board pandemic measures coastal areas.) half bosses job linger drones pretending useful.  need feel authority/power again. rate increase. current number. I'd love see ways redirect money.

I productive worker, healthier, better parent working home. One week back everything (office 2 kids 2 different schools) feel like suck everything almost hope get quarantine situation point get break all. Don’t disrupt echo chamber  days dictating working conditions work majority workers over.

Are really naive sympathy bosses manage people stay home cant see value remote staff. Would suck bosses love micro manage day. Good! fuck need go back office already infrastructure evidence jobs fine home? Oh forgot, bosses one power trips need see working, woe micromanagers. 🙄 I'm sorry. know must hard.

At least would know one gave COVID. husband another couple got COVID daughter. dad ended dying. Washington done great job taking pandemic seriously. wish could afford live there. Yup, idea shit worked younger. Switched gov't private sector ""$8,000/year raise"" gave killer benefits PENSION.  Middle management fearful people realize needed. never were. I’m really sure mean now, whole thread started simply replied someone said million kids could die, reason you’re saying shouldn’t focusing deaths, is….slightly tangent. remember covid hit company sent everyone home.  1 week, begging come going nuts trying stuff home. knew way people org could work effectively remote without people site helping out. 2 weeks, back helping others WFH restarting computers maintaining hardware lab systems.

I'm kind glad company sensible management, put lot effort setting systems help people things productively home there's zero talk ""everyone come back cuz culture"". already planning people permanent WFH, people hybrid people fulltime working stuff like hotel cubicles reservations systems. Basically word ""if need come job, need come in, otherwise not"". Guess we'll see goes covid blows over. gotten tests days travel events make sure I'm asymptomatically spreading.

Too late course. already asymptomatically spreading time find asymptomatically spreading. like driving car looking rear window. Oh look, went ditch. 

This approach may make feel less guilty nothing help. People moved metro cities states starting move back thinking things almost pre-pandemic vaccine office asking return work hybrid.

Their surprise faces rent least 15% much rented previous year moving out. example, one co-worker rented 2 bedroom place $1800 month. downgraded 1 less bedroom complex...$2100 month. I've telecommuter eight years now. There's reason go back lot workers.

My current team working Germany, Russia, Brasil, Argentina, US, Canada.

The company's employees around world, set office. Even execs work home.

It works industry, may work others.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* enough people asking schools opening again?

Why schools mandating vaccines get them? Seems it’s acceptable colleges universities. gotta
Stop calling people idiots! Let people make choice. vaccine isn’t saving anyone stop Well would issue taking considering used humans years completely safe. I'll wait clinical trials done currently ongoing.. get everyone getting arms possible second solution fighting covid lol. Makes sense. mean Google led remote work push?

Google one last major tech companies reluctantly allow employees apply fully remote. day one Google saying prefer in-office encourage collaboration.

The funny thing is, pandemic spent much time collaborating teams campus I'd frequently video call teams site, time walk/bike/shuttle another building half mile away. I'm kinda done answering questions someone clearly want hear answers. Standard practice bill 6 minute increments, .1 hour. 

However, hours work either choose slash self know client going argue me, boss slashes reason. like device fits hand access worlds knowledge. declared illegal companies build AI backed data feeds. obviously psychological experimentation. even admitted 2014: help sure. Stress help. TV shows something, call hospital feel like something wrong, hope feel better soon!

The weird body tingles might anxiety related. weird panic attacks thought dying something I’m sure many countries lockdowns strict lvl 4 is. concept essential services pretty stark really - supermarkets, petrol, dairies, doctors, chemists, vets, maybe others- even protocols access.

No fast food, restaurants, cafes sort. shops really. hairdressers, etc. Businesses work remotely keep going course. [Official site information level also feel like removing drive work alone justify point governments incentivise it. agree reasons even bigger reason fact much carbon emissions reduced less traffic roads need there. also cheaper people terms petrol costs bus passes, etc. want work climate change stop people moving work car every day. That's we've tried years things like public transport incentives cycling work schemes never truly catch they're hassle. Give people comfortable alternative could actually maybe make real difference there. *laughs ""essential"" worker* honestly get it. Like, I'm black. _very_ paranoid vaccine first l. honestly, moment saw rich people skipping lines get it, understood guinea pigs using see worked out. Bu time eligible, enough time pasted people going drop dead, I'd know it. Picked Walmart (for safety knowing Walmart like lawsuits hella controlling) white area (this mostly ease getting slot) kept moving. 

I understand Tuskegee I've even got kinda stories grandparents, parents, personal experience kind subpar care get medical field careful. come on, even believe get you, segregated anymore. go people pretty sure trying screw are. I've worked remotely better part 17 year career. always looked privilege works revoked want getting work done. worked efficiently got much done beyond anyone ever expected basically could whatever wanted. Spent summer lunch time pool. regret travel work younger.

Bottom line is, get establish boundaries working remotely, life becomes much better. Employers believe remote work equates working hours day lose staff. case studies linked done outside US. I’m sure believe I’m focusing US trends. I’m also saying need focus deaths endpoint conversation. important endpoints consider. Yes. This. points resonate me. software engineer, makes sense commute daily office sit alone 8 hours, occasional face face meeting. 

Working home quality life increased dramatically. take short breaks prepare meals family, longer breaks exercise things like take weekly guitar lesson, etc. 

I agree whiteboard sessions hard replicate virtually. ha e found works somewhat make design process async, using shared google doc collaborate design approach. added benefit, course, producing documentation artifact. makes think causes zero symptoms? plenty Floridians hate desantis. kids could think decide wear masks school.  lay blame solely extroverts. extroverted come, tough. know like even less? idea getting Covid.

What I've found amongst coworkers ones smaller kids ones want back office, managers want butts seats. That's it. ones kids say kids driving nuts, want peace quiet office. introverts BTW. 


Edited add. HATE open office spaces. Loud annoying. love around people, get energy it, need concentrate, annoying AF. wasteful office spaces, less pollution

Pretty sure case. companies get rid offices I'm pretty sure people furnishing homes accomedate long work days caused pollution. Well... *okay*. 🙁 Right tell much highly vaccinated. 100% people vaccinated, 100% hospitalizations would vaccinated. 
They need release numbers per 100k. give true sense risk compared unvaccinated.  slightly concrete theory CDC publishing numbers breakthrough infections. pointed elsewhere thread, computing efficacy rate general population using breakthrough cases vs cases unvaxxed people confounded fact know many people groups covid before. consider possible effect previous covid infection efficacy computation, see error introduced likely makes efficacy appear worse actually is.

Right now, practical assess (in statistically rigorous way) group previously infected. see thread, people quick try estimate efficacy without realizing complication. (No aspersions intended towards posters; complicated subject).

So theorize CDC realized information (breakthrough case rates) meaningful without missing information prior infection rates, could easily misused (intentionally otherwise) paint vaccines negative light. Given this, chose release it. Totally agree. Output, especially work isn’t assembly line.

Output driven people eventually go back office cause coordination better face face, especially comes hard copy records. two vacations canceled last year. Spent money garage gym. regret decision all. got go one trips summer (road trip Glacier National Park, right everything started exploding luckily). millions people vaccinated. likelihood anywhere close 1/1000 we'd tens thousands people issues.

So whether there's risk, risk smaller risk covid, purely risk management perspective, still smart take vaccine.

When consider zero reason think even possible outcomes, becomes even smarter take vaccine.

Saying worried outcome evidence suggest even possibility using justify protecting significant danger well known currently running rampant around globe plain idiotic. regional surge absolutely mitigation done? so, end? Cases deaths higher ever Florida show signs declining. going go ""all masks none protect wearer"" crowd. Flatten curve used back March 2020. messaging “2 weeks lockdown flatten curve”. Obviously it’s bit think lot people recoil reverting message. Delta different though, many healthy young people, even teens, children, babies died ended hospitalized Delta compared Alpha variant. Indeed. next six months interesting. 
Looks like boosters recommended older population 6 months second dose Christmas time.
What I'm also interested vaccination kids. made mandatory school attendance. 
This depend heard immunity goes. following happens coming months UK seem reached heard immunity atm. [China donated 40 million vaccines. Less half America doesn’t even make eight digits donations. edit post find it.

Now normally I’d say mixing “selling” vaccines “donating” China sold billions countries India hundreds millions. since post straight misinformation, I’m going assume too. ships infact hardly used. Turns ships far population centers making transportation nightmare, plus risk covid insane doctors nurses live close quarters ships.

So DoD moved doctors nurses civilian hospitals.

Now could military support mission then?

Well, recall, bulk country wasn’t hit early wave, lots people stopped going hospital matter ailments, spare capacity surge medical troops two sites short period time.

Now though? Demand high ever hospitals coast coast, military heavily hit hospitals care for, important troops need dwell time.

Some guy refusing wear mask get vaccinated Alabama doesn’t necessitate families getting ripped apart months end military hospitals struggle provide basic care, that’s works military strike teams super small weeks long.

The emergency ended March.  Removing 1.5 hrs commute certainly improved willingness put bit effort needed. 

My department decided make us fully remote - period. It’s great thing able (admittedly intensive repetitive detail oriented job) home. I’m comfortable. people need buy pulse ox check frequently see o2 doing.

This implies need outside pandemic conditions, question is: information? part, yes, though exact number depends whether mitigating factors play. person still masking? social distancing? going crowded areas live pretty solitary life? raise lower final Rnought particular case; Rnought 5 assuming mitigation efforts whatsoever, IIRC.

My point vaccinated individuals infected contagious unvaccinated individuals infected, say vaccine nothing prevent spread illness still wrong. vaccine outright stop infection, thereby preventing spread entirely first place. Delta likely cause breakthrough cases ancestral COVID variants, still curbed vaccination. 

The best message put ""get vaccine keep hospital guaranteed get COVID matter what."" best message would ""Get vaccine may prevent getting sick altogether, even infected, vaccine greatly reduces chances severe illness."" Seriously? divorce attorney bragging billing 15 min increments compared ex's billed complete hour work whatsoever. Read 1 email 5 mins = 1 hour = $300. current one UK

Your brain obviously destroyed COVID Usually think P95s oil. Apparently R95 similar little less effective oil. One bosses worked 30 second window fast could respond instant message, working remote. got minimally shouting session minor discipline. 

I'm sure absolutely loved past year. Literally anyone half brain job middle management thats give half brains.

Middle managements job is: keep line. Anyone thinks otherwise middle manager lying person incapable independent work. Thank you! Woke morning sore throat gone headache barely noticeable 2/10. super runny nose now, head congested (ears keep popping) I’m super tired time- that’s body fighting it. don’t know reaction would unvaccinated I’m glad vaccinated. Real head scratcher, one...  Remember get vaccinated also remember this, face creator universe really sorry believe him.  Yeah - struggle think fully enclosed spaces renfest. shops restaurants outside. couple performance spaces provide shelter rain sun, even generally open air least three sides. Yeah, understand anyone except petty control freaks would care. get work done home. go office maybe every week two make sure we're page. clients happy. Everyone happy. cares? 


If end result less money spent AC office space sounds good bottom line, too. Seems office real estate owners shook foresee values declining. really matters them? realized need middle managers have.  Lol... Go back shell.

The UK donated COVAX. COVAX decides give vaccines to.

You're clearly US doesn’t blood it’s hands. 

HAHAHAHAHAHA. made laugh.

Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Palestine, Vietnam, Cuba, etc etc etc etc would like fucking word.  also fact daily long commutes office job barely even century old, could easily go way switchboard brick mortar movie rental stores. reason shelf life isn’t normally extended due impacting sales. extend sell new ones? I’m device side Pharma worked multiple products proven 3-5 year shelf life labeling update never submitted extend beyond 1-3 years. Why? Money fear time comes likelihood incorrect storage. It’s conspiracy. People indifferent flu vaccine year year really bum think it. attitude less efficacy bother, that's even reason everyone get it.... Maybe live city every pharmacy offers free, can't imagine quick access minimal inconvenience choosing to. I'm scared get older one day flu shot less effective immune system, young people go catch bounce back. convince employer job done 100 percent remotely, matter time position going open lowest bidder around globe. enjoy can. Funny big businesses love talk ""data"" comes profits, impact regulations, etc. can't seem muster single (likely massaged) point say remote work detrimental business want be.

Instead hear bunch unquantifiable softwords (usually disdained) ""culture"" ""innovation.""

If business harmed measurable way, employees treated like adults told exactly happened, damage measured, etc.

Otherwise, blow smoke ""culture,"" really much leg stand on. governor...whew boy. nearly bad TN, boy guys governor saying schools use logic enforce masking, he's going cut financially...wow, one biggest dick moves I've seen. what? Oh, prove he's biggest dick room. ""answer"" meaningless without data support it.

What hypothesis, answer.

It seems far likely that, people USA got vaccinated sooner, protection waned hasn't, since us get second doses months ago. might case. remember consultant wasn’t allowed bill work flight. Seriously, flying coast coast every week, 10+ hours plane, told management could work flight bill it. bullshit work policy I’ve ever come across. can’t change size classrooms. 32 kids class means social distancing. Everyone neighborhood spent last year’s travel budget home improvement. listened drilling sawing day every day last summer. sound like joy work don’t think so- it? Based determine likelihood delta not. never worked CEO government defense contractor insist turn 2fa allow use password across accounts.

I left industry, anymore. got tired working hard stay current latest technology keep companies honestly country secure CEO Chad's marginalize everything do. yeah, almost 30 year career, I'm out. 

I focus deep learning automation now, going destroy office middle class gotta eat. Makes sense. Another metric worth looking at, ever clearly gets reported, ""severity"" infection previously vaxxed vs previously infected.

Getting infected one thing, quickly effectively body responds another point interest.  immune systems complete profile coronavirus, guess would average immune response would swift severity would lower due viral load able establish hold vital organs. Since vaccinations provide better profile gate, likely previously infected encouraged still get vaccinated.

All speculation end, important number research feel matter much get sick BADLY, we're going deal stubbornly unvaccinated populations foreseeable future. See India. 4 million dead. I'm middle management corporate spot on. None peers superiors seem understand *want* become director. flat believe me. like job, like able work intimately team, I'm comfortable income, blowing vastly hours stress, loss relationships way worth little money opinion. Plus life outside work, main motivator point career.  director seems miserable, none ones I've known seem particularly happy lives. wow, actually work instead walking around city groups 5 nothing...   comparing potential risk vaccine fully adult bodies vs risk covid fully adult bodies risks still low those. They’re paid hour, it’s logging time client hour. Thanks pressure higher ups don’t want upset clients facing larger expected bill, staff end understating billable hours.  also mean problem, especially current evidence supports vaccines working. need boosters? Yes. Right need focus getting people vaccinated.   Complete barbarism. Australians don’t speak fight draconian bullshit government putting this, whatever heinous things policies cause next. ridiculous suggest necessary back March 2020. vaccines largely effective. deaths per day US 50% Spring 2020 peak. much better treatments understanding virus. cases spiking, deaths way vaccine. dying overwhelmingly choose get vaccinated. Real slippery slope white collar jobs going overseas like blue collar ones did. Here’s thing. think right wrong here. point, don’t think millions kids going die current variables remain same. 

However, think lot going get sick possibly sick enough require hospitalization. regard, don’t think assumptions hyperbolic nature current research showing post COVID damage. hate sensational newsreels shit, I’m also worried focusing wrong stats. COVID demonstrated quite insidious. death toll may enough “scare” people believing it’s serious. real long term issues see emerging, considerable effect people’s quality life. already see things effecting adults, good reason assume won’t effect kids, would feel better taking something seriously kicking back laissez-faire people drank flavor-aid constructed social life around co workers office it’s sad exercise capitalism’s efficiencies. bullshit ‘company culture’ that, find employee retention going leasing square footage cut half, they’ll get board.

I'm unable view graph, asking antibody waning exponential decay? Oh, mean second dose quickly antibodies wane quickly enough doses justify it? believe answer antibodies one part immune system, another goal vaccine build long-lasting durable immune memory (T cells, etc): better accomplished two doses, rather one, due immune system works.

I apologise missed word also, China inventing outbreaks purely PR they're also inventing outbreaks get people vaccinated? think Chinese people also believe there's COVID China? Otherwise, would need invented outbreaks get vaccinated?

""The researchers found R95 masks able filter 60 per cent exhaled aerosols, KN95 masks could filter 46 per cent. 
On hand, cloth masks surgical masks filtered 10 per cent 12 per cent exhaled aerosols, respectively."" 


The type mask matters lot. sub already knew that, huge difference. None I'm aware of, although many countries requiring doses brand... now, least. I've done survey small company, 2 wanted fully remote, rest hybrid.

Management read shit articles work cohesion make everyone come again. vaccination rates younger people Florida (and everywhere else) even worse old people, wonder ICU population trending younger. mask fight went exact way 1918… And...First thought was, many kids mask feel punished, therefore take masks, too? immediate reward greater motivator? depressing think that's far likely kids putting masks on. clients want lawyers wrong?

Due diligence cheap!

Highly experienced current lawyers less so. I've worked home since covid, entire company remote. couple employees like years usually end going work cowork space. get work office full people, get small talk office chit chat working home. Sure get actual colleagues person, job stays WFH might worth looking you. Except people massively overdosing stuff. Something like two hundred times dose, diluted all.

This like whole ""inject disinfectant"" thing again. Certainly death bad outcome. bad outcomes whole host causes. mom lingering symptoms Lyme's disease year, stop hiking. Covid unique causing bad illness.

(Once again, unvaccinated, that's different story). declared it. Letting vaccines spoil instead giving countries.

Nowhere anyone say anything vaccination rate. also radioactive Please share research benefit. sorry, that’s horrible state (MN) ability enact another mask mandate.  Alabama. Big surprise require precautions. bad South secede. 
... Yes everything horrible months ago like around April, buuut high Vax acceptance culturally, despite dumbass president. Plus think climate, sun exposure ppl walking around getting exposed badly summer (Jan/Feb peak) might helped. Also delta dominant strain, def tho. Poor man everything right.

Condolences family. Shouldn’t issues J&amp;J Astrozenica given confidence Pfizer Moderna vaccines? issues first two found pretty quickly, latter 2 way people take nothing close serious reported. could see point view first couple months, we’ve much data seems ridiculous weren’t convinced May-June latest. simply put, allowed now, aren’t prepared panic everyone vaccinated December-February coming get booster don’t die. 

The “eight-month wait” complete bullshit, that’s nothing getting ducks row roll out. studies show immunity wanes six months, rollout wouldn’t complete shit show, they’d told get booster yesterday. know New Mexico, literally one following mask mandates, including employees. Says you, I’m sure know yet. theories even studies done mice humidity plays factor severity. It’s possible increased humidity air people breathe Westin mask, masks could actually reduce severity. 

And think problem really you’re saying sure seem definitive answers unsure many things stills.  Vaccine happened. São Paulo state 72% first dose 32% second dose (because 3 months interval gap). 

A things note: Bolsonaro wanted buy vaccines. knew why. 

But then, inquiry senate, found reason wanted middle-man companies buy vaccine, way bribes (1 dollar per dose). inquiry open, finally Bolsonaro gov signed deal buy Pfizer vaccines March (they literally send 100 emails without answer last year). 200 million doses end year. Pfizer sending 1 million doses everyday, week send 2 million. 

São Paulo Governor also bough 4 million Sinovac vaccine state. recourse...I've already tried. hospital worked took masks away support staff still made us interact patients. Masks stacked ceiling one reuse. C19 ruined lungs gave stroke. lost career ability walk 25 feet. consulted attorney, said ones going able sue this.  part we're baboons watching incoming road project. Thank god vaccines though; damn.  use Aug 9 (because think values vaxxed group incomplete that), get (39.6 - 12.4) / 39.6 * 100 = 68% efficacy.

Did math wrong, use different days?  Masks ability minimize reduce severity illness. virus enters body, genetic makeup determine symptoms viruses ability reproduce infecting healthy cells. Mask play part virus enters body.   Thanks. Yeah, there's definitely also component vaccines weaker Delta. totally know whether that's Delta infectious overall, got different proteins variants vaccines developed for, immune system prepared. mean imply factor also. Trump rally Alabama HUGE event… I'm waiting tik tok videos morons taking start agree this, though would suggest focus messaging real problem here. never reason think vaccines 99.99% effective (but still really good, get vaxxed boostered friends). Nature give shit messaging strategies political considerations.  Took around 3 months fully get bronchitis several years ago; lungs working 50% awhile. Super annoying, can’t imagine Covid would wreck things. better way describe Facebook, truth. 
  
""Facebook gas station toilet"" 
 - some_asshat US could use global good will. reason this? Thanks; yeah, that's different understanding. understanding like security system bought intruders using blunt instruments. now, system needs updated intruders shifted tactics using keycards hacks. goober internet.    Would consider follow counterpoint good simple argument anti vaxxer?

In order “I don’t want vaccine body” argument stand, must first ask denier assume NEVER catch covid. 

I think even deniers would admit they’ll probably catch it. 

There’s nothing vaccine covid doesn’t have. 

Their rhetoric seems crumble this. oversimplified thinking? probably am. Stunted growth really, really big issue. Even get decent help, majority still live problems long time, sheer number severity cases overwhelm even best mental health systems meaning vast majority children affected get left behind. time tell bad is, personally think generation's 9/11. Well rev jackson wife hospitalized, think pretty bad. 

Or completely fine. Whats point article. funny say study article references actually say much mask effectiveness. then, read article's title something agreed totally it. Spread misinformation indeed. Agreed. Environmental concerns different topic me.

As far covid goes... think getting right. people testing positive board? Sure. much lower rate respective communities. seen pretty solid plan place test positive. Quarantine areas separate section ventilation system. extensive contact tracing board someone tests positive. Carnival Vista made news couple weeks ago 27 positives (26 crew &amp; 1 passenger.) *900* teats first positives. Honestly, wish community took seriously cruise industry does. plans place debark sick passenger needs greater ship medical center supply (at additional cost travel insurance.)

I'm saying risk. certainly is. entered lightly. given much thought ""what if's"" basically game plan already thought foreseeable scenarios. someone done personal risk assessment, thought could go wrong &amp; decided sail...wish good trip. quite likely safer ship taking care essential business community.

Yes big issue. efficacy vaccines delta oversold long. media also comments upvotes social media. slowly starting turn around (mostly reality people see around longer ignored) first signals reduced efficacy delta , coming delta wave India , months old.

Its complicated issue lots important data still missing. Delta consists several sub variants efficacy vaccines also depends sub variant going around certain area. 

The pandemic marathon maintaining public trust long run important trying convice small amount aditional people take vaccine end effective promised. 

Most people trust science would take vaccine anyway regardless highly effective bit less effective. vast majority people maintaining trust part population important thing. Overselling efficacy risks undermining trust. 

People dont trust science take vaccine regardless promised,they (wrongly,as vaccine still far better vaccine) feel right along people doubts convinced doubts difficult convince next round. 

A vaccine still far better vaccine also delta efficacy high enough end problems coming pandemic.

Scientists reviewed document found number discrepancies information contains previously disclosed Sputnik V’s developers, including landmark Feb. 2 peer-reviewed report leading medical journal Lancet, found vaccine 91.6% efficacy. 
Flaws newly-obtained report range apparent typos basic numerical errors — mislabelled statistics table headings — serious concerns, including unexplained changes number patients study.

That's Simpson Paradox. That's pointing base rate fallacy, know base vaccination rates compute right efficacy number.

You get Simpson Paradox two factors concentrated one population. example one factor, vaccination rate. need second breakdown population, say, age, older population group much higher risk hospitalization. Ok?

Who's starting screaming match and/or getting beaten time? knows! implying? got shingles 26 joke hurt like hell LOL. called local health department. know COVID line is? voicemail box.

They stopped contact tracing except nursing homes. point vaccinated people basically gone back normal, masking.

The vaccine dramatically reduced likelihood hospitalization death. referring restrictions, put way. Look current fight going mask mandates. date majority places still don’t mask mandate one even thought capacity restrictions etc. long don’t mind possibly wearing mask, 2022 would call smallish chance, trip zero restrictions. first tests taken soon possible patient receives positive result, second taken 28 days later.

Europe supply Canada Mexico, well rest world. Man sound like beginning rebellion, would surprised. I'm curious - symptoms effects now? There's lot talk really temporary long-term effects. Several European countries 1% population May-July, first doses second. Eric &amp; cart could highly useful shortly FL. post mods review stories death individual Last report saw 600 breakthrough cases 5.4 million vaccinated (0.01%), primarily among older chronic 40% 240 0.004%.

I sure offhand vaccines make 60%. very, very, rare. Perfect ren-fest cosplay… definitely need age data. swear they’ve stopped frequently reporting age statistics 18+ vaccines rolled out. knew Mississippi dumb, holy shit. see 60 require booster shot? 60 still lose antibodies overtime need extra shot? “One pound feathers definitely lighter one pound bricks!”

This basically we’re dealing country. willfully proudly uneducated believe European countries like Norway expressly masks schools want kids suffer Sometimes wonder Fox News one big secret social experiment see far push crazy bullshit gullible idiots’ throats get away it. top 10. even close. name 10 European countries higher vaccination rate. Sorry hear that. friend two doses April got covid July. Mild symptoms, loss smell longest one, took 4-5 weeks get back.

Meanwhile kissed day tested positive (before test), I've got symptoms all. positive close contact, I'd never known good antibodies covid.

Also CDC contacted get blood sample determine variant (Delta higher mutation apparently).

Weirder part stronger reaction vaccine me. lot factors playing gets infected guess. Many kids home and/or masked last year. exposed even though haven’t vaccinated. Y'all forget Colorado Renaissance Festival held without restrictions, too.  Yurop? didn’t know Romania produced Pfizer Moderna. 

Also, US exported millions doses mRNA vaccines Canada. Commercially. riddled dolts

I get people anxious COVID serious, but...come folks. also use lunch breaks household chores, office time would wasted. much work time use things. Plus, announcements many FL DOH employees COVID. some, matter much precautions taking. Got first vaccine COVID.

There *REASON* go back.

Quality life, flexibility, cost, pollution, lower infrastructure cost, etc.

There lots reasons *NOT* go back.  Company meeting last week get us back office--no masks needed, vaccine mandate, distancing, nada. shocked people voiced concerns lack plan desire put CEO's desire people office health employees especially given jobs done fully remote we've done completely successfully. They'll equally shocked start quitting droves. already huge issue late 90s early 00's. Loads outsourced eventually repatriated bc great looked paper. might go another wave though bc management short memory. thing proved unnecessary office many jobs. 

It's control aspect bosses miss. bosses worth working first place. symptomatic known exposure?
I believe antigen tests 20-60% false positives depending whether person symptomatic time since exposure. think matter what, I’d trust PCR results more, particularly taken later (in time since exposure). said, I’d make sure PCR tests taken conditions would yield lowest rates false negatives - ie 5+ day range since exposure. latest one was, I’d say trust it. Overall, i’d personally believe negative - lifestyle people I’m around don’t require particularly low risk tolerance 40 old enough listen doctor. Going doctors advice pandemic insane. Sometimes mentally ill people die. That’s insult toilets … least toilets carry effluent away … Facebook brings Offal right people’s hands. knew would participate thought time ICUs failing hospitals turning people away self preservation would kick is. nurse thirty years think many people lamented treating diseases seriously enough. maybe people move there's adequate internet access, physical offices are. learn. 500 years nothing! People say company work home absolute disaster. people working two jobs words paid two neither. People set systems deal interfacing clients huge backlash. deadlines missed left right.

So universal people productive happier. works better industries others. Mandate hell it. sad frustrating people forced right thing, are. 

We collect tears, distill salt use salt saline anti-vax crowd gets hospitals going forward. He's got small pee pee energy No, it’s lots doctors, it’s publicity-seeking quacks.

Thats you, long accept promotion/bonuses vs group performance dont mind leaving money tsble business. I’m squeeze people like lemon.

On hand, I’ve fired quite hires couldnt get shit together deliver anything even remediation training.

Edit: oh yeah we’re US. American co workers idea time office=promotion something. really dystopian US manager move ask akward questions like: 
US manager: fuck bob!
Me: kid’s sick
US manager: Again? Doesnt wife?
Me/other managers: .. thats works Maybe little, employees building still need keep heating/cooling, phones, internet running. change 500 50 employees. could sublease floors companies wanting reduce office space would ideal. Though still end empty offices somewhere need dealt somehow. Romania 25 percent, going bad fall.  Modmailed  bosses worked 30 second window fast could respond instant message, working remote. 

Horrifying. needed rapid response, called. number people treating text messages ""voice"" conversation high. \~20K daily infections FL currently. That's probably count factor least 10 since people getting tested. let's make simple say true infections 100K per day. That's 20 million infections next May (FL 21 million people). Combined people already infected vaccinated (some get virus), think sounds reasonable? still working numbers, recommend (again) going directly studies.

That changing rapidly due Delta.

But *do know* linked above, much much likely get sick natural immunity vaccination. 

Reinfections *much common* breakthrough infections. Yeah, never understood that. always switched mindset home moment entered lift switched music. would amazing, million regulatory reasons might work. think even mandate businesses allow people stay get tested weekly. Queue cottage industry fake test results. guarantee it. people office also makes awkward difficult interviews competitors. There’s difference enjoying working colleagues actually wanting spend face-to-face time them. really like people work with, don’t want see amount time don’t need to. Software development perks, driving office politics mandated lunch meetings month annoys introverted types aren’t vocal social needs (or lack thereof). Also, think employees love jobs work love coding analysis, that’s may true 

We send memes stuff back forth too, manager expected us office mandated fun time, know current circle would probably groan request free market always complete total lie. lie told keep morons paying attention man behind curtain, enriching buddies backroom deals cronyism. Good! Ren faires outside, low risk spread hope Ohios faire starts 2 weeks same. Wear mask want to. know plenty people work faire one beyond harsh Update yesterday. Got second moderna shot noon yesterday. I'm bad today, headache body kinda aches otherwise I'm ok.👍 Yes. always catch multiple viruses, virus bacterial infection simultaneously. sick already risk factor anything transmissible Covid. Yup. Still hate needles w/a passion. 

Have asthma/allergies life. Don’t luxury like people breathing good, ok w/not getting something body needs. I’ll take chances possible side effects, nothing killed yet.

Just cam back funeral today extended family. Dude planning get vacc’d walk-in drive away. Due work hours, probably couldn’t it. Ended hospital, heard probably would lived think stroke also came in. Fully expect come mom’s front door like: “Hey, mom at? workin’ said need car checked shit. call today. Yo, kiddo doing’?” :’C I’m gonna cry now. Thanks filling in. I've always loved NZ trying convince wife move there, moving side world tough sell. least data show anyone thinks masks work. gotta specify ones. think got it? mean, hospitalization rate 2.6/100,000 bringing pediatric medical systems knees...that's sign need hospital capacity.

Obviously, ism't immediately solution (it's longer term project), worst pandemic ends, definitely need focus building better medical capacity. pandemic revealed many cracks    hybrid model best solution personably. would love go occasionally work remote. don’t distractions tho mass vaxx started April numbers late April elderly high risk individuals. I'm saying that's useful information skews results since includes vulnerable people. feel like need new perspective delta affecting low high risk vaccinated people separately. Maybe people low risk actually really well protected high risk people need booster asap. IDK would good info inform decisions behavior since literally nobody wear mask liberal town.

Edit: Also broken vaccine. Get high horse Really depend team, folks get along culture joke now... wait headline. worried much parent...

The words follow statement say otherwise.  Posts economic changes caused covid allowed. country vets arrested vaccinating people vaccines meant dogs. 100 people got shot. we're talking professionals went college years learn biology. even fabricated study said safe effective.  NZ every chance squashing outbreak

Yeah, likely *full* lockdown might last weeks spread likely means untraced contacts disease. Singapore went 26 cases 200 cases daily week. partial lockdown, despite 50% *fully&amp; vaccination rate single dose) point, still reduced case load low single digits despite 75% full vaccinated rate (~80% single dose).

NZ may done well previously, vaccination procurement policy good all. Maybe company/industry. gaming started 35k ended 105k 7 years. went generic UI dude section lead (rendering/systems), lead engineer game.

I must admit, different strategy get noticed person vs remote. I’m still sure well remote. basics it, me, always excellent work. Solve problems 95% engineer team cant solve. rests there’s self promotion direct manager knows you’re good work (in case sucks advocating guys). gets people complained CDC conspiring recommending masks sooner also complaining required wear masks participate society. say mean always self-inflected. Sorry give impression. clarify sentence edit. I'm sure ended worst timeline definitely stupidest. One dogs new mother :( Laughing death, good morals would love watch Revolution small dedicated stadium. Kraft incentive sell club. Yeah, people keep saying masks mostly/only work protect others, posted info scientific study/CDC/FDA/Mayo Clinic says fact protect wearer lot, especially N95 masks better. desperate win this. Lol heavy sigh everyone screen vaccine telling others hazardous.

Lol 🍿🍿🍿  message board

having Patch Adams flashbacks  Exactly. decide whether interrupted. helped productivity immensely. something never knew needed.  aside, it’s awful lawyers consultants measure productivity efficiency terms # hours billed. understand law consulting firms’ revenue model based metric creates terrible work environment employees obliterates sense work/life balance. take vaccine approved FDA taken millions, take drug meant freaking horses literally says th packaging ""not human use"". understand level Idiocracy. Oh yeah, forgot lmao

My bad accepted job offer fully remote. I'm going back. Can't wait live wherever want. Pics happen 8 months? Well puts bit ease then. got mine April starting get bit worried might decline protection soon (U.S.) need lift sanctions get ingredient produce vaccines. done travel year, short trips (one two nights) mostly outdoor activities there, including dining outdoors even car. places pretty low rolling average cases. 

Can't imagine setting foot airplane anytime soon, able get town awhile things town (zoo, hiking, soccer, etc) great. vaccinated stay overnight anywhere went town day.  Facebool gloats nation state money, fucking malfeasance match. started one case. would say 1 Great Dr better 1 great Vet. would certainly rather 100 great Vets care 1 great Dr. honestly 55 yrs met great Dr. met 1 great Vet. rarer would like. but....

/s  [Seeing story broke seriously *no* reasonable, safe way could’ve gotten dogs home (which lined up)? Facebook main catalyst keeping pandemic going. Look news article 80% comments filled anti-vax/anti-mask lies Facebook nothing it. doubt Facebook worst thing happen humanity past 80 years. prepared!!!! danced virus away! /s &lt;I'm paraphrasing but, feels like 3rd world country. wonder keywords triggered automatic bot? people concerned covid already vaccinated, though.

If attend events, unlikely get sick, even delta.  Certain words trigger auto mod. Happens lot completely innocuous posts. New hire onboarding used take month basically word mouth new hire they'd need service it'd take forever get approved

Now get going 4-5 days, sometimes sooner. incredible. NZ govt took time seeing vaccine worked best, since covid community. clear Pfizer went 100% vaccine, purchasing enough everyone. March 2021 back queue, big shipments late July. began public vaccination drive August right 40 plus eligible. opens 30 year olds 2 days ages 1 September. 

We already surpassing US peak per capita vaccination rates polls show low vaccine hesitancy here. expect get higher rates US around October hopefully reach high protection December. There’s suggestions exposure spike protein cause inflammation tissue damage, regardless origin. yeah, research, conclude we’re kinda fucked. problem state wide statistics mask areas low vaccination. Oregon 57% fully vaccinated call National Guard troops help. Needless say, don’t think going lock down.

Not highly effective vaccines. Try watching games Foxboro New Jersey sometime. It’s even masks. I’m sure could’ve brought dogs car someone show proof ID window dog get in. 

The fact went straight putting dogs insane. Bingo ""The ends justify means"" always dangerous precedent set. Ok great doctor better 100 great vets. Google vaccination snippet. OWID sometimes uses different number population skews metrics, final numbers dependent sources use. [NYT Vaccination gives good overview countries rank higher Israel. know nothing “anything-proof,” many think outdoors completely devoid risk anything goes. events rules furthers sentiment. r/quickmaffs America country world children. Also learn reading kill millions kids **potentially** end

We know bad get since prior strains hit hard variant could evolve something *by end* kills millions kids forefront time, especially staggered vaccinations kids usual age ranges kind illness hit hardest, think back kansas (spanish) flu seasonal flu, mortality usually older young people, next variant mutates something similar? 

Remember basic virology, resistance *helping* situation, likely virus bounce around find better ways ""survive"" harming host. no, nothing ""false"" said, I'm talking end-game literally one worst pandemics *long* time. mean close? read single shots wrong lacked context facts Israel public health protocols. mistake part. window limitation work unvaccinated vaccinated. vaccinated exist 3 week windows too? 

So, saying old folks vaccinated dying larger number unvaccinated folks current time. 

Yes, look data sets. that. totally acceptable. take away happening stat? No. 

You also taking consideration weakening vaccines. would increase incidence rate, especially among old. many factors consider. Oh wow, that's month lvl 4 lockdown? Playing persons strengths may work well critical mass people aren’t office.

Say 10% people productive large group. 10% office enough “large group” basically working home, office.

The office work allowed people return work want, nearly universally comments are, “there’s nobody here,” people aren’t choosing return. feel like removing drive work alone justify WFH positions. Firstly, car accidents happen rush hour dangerous time road. Second, it’s unpaid time spent around working. aren’t compensated commutes today’s world it’s uncommon hour long commutes directions. WFH needs stay. made technological progress opening work style, can’t undo Nothing says high risk covid one person working shelter bring dogs cars without sort contact driver. 

Nope, gotta put dogs down. reasonable safe way get home. Ffs. It’s scary think close delta(or something like it) rip entirely unvaccinated population. managers people want staff back work , managers function observe workers traditional hierarchical / surveillance office environment …. It’s become increasingly clear many managers entirely un necessary. That’s country much guilt colonialism. You’re helping countries direct hand impoverishing. US doesn’t blood it’s hands. some, nothing compared size former British empire. No, tons different vets well. injured elephant go vet specializes small birds something.  worry scro'! plenty cavepersons living really kick ass lives. first wife cavewoman. pilot now. They've running comparison charts NZ media.

Oh wow, amazing. I'm convinced. four million people United States received coronavirus vaccine Saturday — nation’s highest one-day total since shots began rolling December — amid rising caseload increase hospitalizations.

US population 328 million, 4 million vaccines entire population. 

Keep running comparison charts though. way, good. Anyone would spend minute playing like medieval peasant bit book. bored went random invite. called Cringe Fest. Kind like Minnesota State Fair, play bingo crowd. Fat Chck/Skinny Guy couple, Giant Turkey Leg, Bad Back Tattoo, Neck Tattoo, Crying lost Child. etc.. get point. Yes, that’s number go by, there’s 50% reduction chance getting infected 50% reduction getting hospitalised infected, means 25% patients hospital fully vaxxed.  explain, simple terms, 59%ve determined. head, seems like everyone assumed exposed enough infected 59% develop symptoms. know everyone gets exposed. Otherwise, shouldve last year vaccines. little bit weather effects less previous infections? sure hope you’re right masking Social distancing though. it’s weather north trouble soon. Certainly part Spain (south) vaccine rollout fast, efficient &amp; easily accessible everyone (regardless legal status Spain) - vaccinating 12s area now. Also judgement masks, went yesterday *everyone* (except 2 British tourists) still masked up.

You’re downvoted tend agree terms cases. areas south may close peaking Delta surge far over. question area US going light next. may also see dip early fall shooting like last year. mention fact Coronavirus cases usually much worse fall winter! look [history pandemic](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states&amp;highlight=United%20States&amp;show=agg-only&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right#states), ""mild"" spike last summer, got really bad towards end year. reason think pattern hold year, though would thrilled wrong. However, seem abandoned lot things working favor last year, like closing schools businesses, enforcing various social distancing measures. Plus, course, Delta running wild now. great extent ourselves.

Im wondering bc legitimacy data. many claiming vaxxed arnt order get priority(in minds least) many gotten third fourth vaccine early accidentally made sick?

This seem crazy me--at least Twins games happening months... Lies, damn lies, &amp; statistics… assumed she/he meant they're scared relaxed Covid given even vaccinated still slim chance losing sense smell  Maybe get underground network alternative vaccines going. feel like they're taking alternate treatment, like horse dewormer, getting trusted neighborhood drug dealer, meanwhile actually vaccine. 

As long government health care officials stay it, might fall we'd better off. 

Someone...get started this. Actually, us guys followed guidelines, got vaxxed, etc, endangered refuse believe problem. I’ll never understand wearing mask big deal. Oh, that’s right, people victim mentality rebel literally everything. could ask Zeus instant healing Ah, see. hope people motivated get vaccinated. Delta tearing Florida (where live). know three people fence vaccination finally decided get vaccine. I’m sure make Delta since Pfizer 5 weeks, Moderna 6 weeks, JJ delta unknown efficacy (so it’s unpopular now). You’re right fear—it power motivate. I’ve seen it.

Good luck! daily updates Ontario offer nice breakdown: Probability severe outcomes kids still low. kids infected hence greater number hospitalized. However number still large compared age groups. They'll wait ECMO machines feel fine today, arm doesn’t hurt anymore. symptoms having? belief Sars-Cov2 approaching point maximum fitness. Unlike influenza, coronaviruses good error correction. copies made, fewer mistakes proteins. Influenza changes like crazy. changes don’t benefit either virus completely random. Natural selection decides mistake beneficial. 

So, hope sars-cov2 like viruses controlled vaccination. likely mutate reach peak fitness. Measles top seen transmissibility. stabilize allows vaccination eradicate them.

I questions:

- think safe start planning booking trip yet? don’t want sink time, money, excitement planning something go drain like 2020 travel plans due COVID. plan book, better 95% sure it’s actually going happen, hate getting super excited trip put time planning let COVID, anything really.
- think even enjoy trip? mean pretty comfortable going local places right (with vaccine, distancing, masking eating/drinking, dining outdoors, sanitation, etc.) pretty comfortable going theme parks, stores, malls, restaurants, arcades, outdoor sports games, movie theaters, etc. local area, want know COVID restrictions summer 2022 make hard enjoy trip (haven’t traveled since summer 2019 don’t really experience that).
- Florida bad summer 2022? Disney World part trip highlight us, never there. huge Disney Parks fan (been Disneyland CA dozens times), one part really looking forward to, anything else, concerned safe/being guilt-tripped Reddit going “COVID breeding ground” missing one place intensely wanting go 2 years now. case counts bad now, think calm then?

(Repost yesterday since posted late night.) far along guys process? everyone wants vaccine get one? so, vaccine access good delta surge? 

I ask last week guy Europe criticize soon Americans took mask explained people country still wore mask without complaints, looked still working getting older people vaccinated. like, well course guys wouldn’t stop, people still waiting vaccines delta surging. America stopped wearing mask everyone 12 wanted vaccine got one delta reached here. Asking Americans wear mask months delta would absolutely validated concerns people worried there’s endgame mask leaving offering vaccine everybody wasn’t considered good enough.

Lockdowns biggest loss civil liberties recent years Lol would great important waste service's resources. think consider (if interests you) AMA! informative easy understand answers, thank you. Patterns set broken. one be. I've managing remote engineering team 15 years- long long Covid. managing onsite teams 15 that. is, IMHO, night day difficult manage remote team. And, IMHO, issues solved remote work actually issues horrible open offices long commutes- anything specifically remote vs onsite work.

Some thoughts decade:

* 25% people productive matter are. 25% problematic matter are. 50% people work better form office infrastructure. Everyone thinks first 25%

* Dealing HR issues much much problematic remote employees. Try dealing terming someone substance abuse problem never get see person attendance record support HR case

* People's home environments often horribly full distractions. People put Covid alternatives- someone's toddler running around screaming meetings issue. good WFH environment dedicated home office good WFH employee uninterrupted time office- home workspaces set properly

* People's WFH performance deteriorates time- especially many years. Especially employees kids one parent WFH. Suddenly realize working around employee pick kids school every day work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around able disappear couple hours day.

* simply good current tech substitutes classic conference room whiteboard session. remotely sucks.

All managed appropriate focus/tools/etc. adds substantially managerial effort required. think seemed work Covid better would many tech firms paused slowed project work period. (I know clients basically shelved project deliverables last/this year getting back regular project planning cycles)

We'll see, maybe I'll wrong tech progressed point work. think norm going become hybrid plans folks office couple days week can't fully live anywhere want Well, everyone infected COVID point, guess get lot stupid. wouldn’t say them. consultant never lied hours worked. said, agree significant pressure overbill, work inefficiently bill hours, etc. they're non-transparent, keep telling us outbreaks? expressed clearly, you’re pedantic. source this?

It’s weird compare device meant hold things coming mouth device meant hold shit waste products. y’all couldn’t agree more.

She proceeded tell vaccines planned getting due age “we know ones work aren’t suspicious.”

The good ones able stay organized, check periodically, hold efficient zoom meetings.  several teacher friends. confirm. far majority schools even opened yet. late me, ""managers"". one went shitty open office plan forced everyone wear noise canceling headphones concentrate. part make sure us (me, least) intention going back. WFH rest. I've current employer 18 years I'll talking recruiters day hear might going back.

As managers tell software people (at least) actually seeing them. could run Matrix screensaver would think super-productive.  think lot like manager meetings depts show fiefdoms.

Driving office order sit crammed tiny stalls headphones on, remoting servers nowhere physically close you--that make sense anyone? 


If actually walking behind people way know productive--I'd say time work business processes get better project management.

The thing I'll miss good whiteboard session, person. hate Zoom video, uncanny valley x4. minimize thing unless someone screen sharing.

To clarify, culture suck. outside meetings, people basically make schedule newbie first job college, there's pressure impress. Thank you! guess wrong, one suffer perhaps die.

Yeah knew business traveler getting gouged, like didn’t care since wasn’t paying. 

I didn’t realize much gouging going though stayed weekend couple times. Silicon Valley hotel room charging 325 per night suddenly cost 150 less weekend. 

I get it, it’s still irritating. many people gotten vaccine, would gotten vaccine Trump won? told last year could trust Trump can't Biden won? Fortunately there’s video huddle, least none could find.

Audio would bad enough. Ooo, much different kind work team software. right. Things would bit different challenging. said, I’m 100% sure company could find way keep happy motivated studies, take grain salt. Also, I'm Europe, guess US oil different. 

But really believe working home economy lose out. course adjustment period, end day, things adapt. 

So, example. I've worked different cities one know best Lisbon. metro area 3M people. Portugal high tax gas Paris agreement lack nuclear energy. energy ends expensive carbon tax. Also, fuel imported. refinery, imported oil. 

Working home would reduce: lunch out, restaurants next business areas, reduce fuel usage traffic tickets. hand, people would (and rn) using restaurants suburbs, time dine week, saving money gas use things. So, save money imported gas reuse local stuff (not necessarily large chunk sure). 

Additionally, helps decentralization, case Portugal (and also lots places) huge, helps small businesses outside city center.  FDA approving Monday. body breaks rna within couple weeks. 4 billion people around world taken Covid vaccines. long terms effects Covid much worse. Ah Lisa gets braces forecast. It’ll likely FDA approved tomorrow. get approval go? Tye chance kid dying symptoms seems unchanged.

But statement jumps question ""Is likely infected kids get symptoms?"" Pfizer likely get full FDA approval tomorrow wait announcement tell want it. really CDC issue, solutions mentioned shift burden average person onto corporations public/private institutions costs money, America hates kind change involves spending money. general rule, you’re thinking getting tested. Get tested. doesn’t hurt. It’s free. company adopted remote working permanently even things go back ""normal"". decided move small apartment near office get large house little bit out, near woods lake. quality life increase mind blowing. Shitty boss red flags one.

You one individual person amongst sea people. time people able agree eat lunch, think going view uprooting current work life balance?

This either need micromanagement, idiocy, incompetence plain disregard employees.

I tested 5 times Friday  
2 home tests - Positive  
Took PCR &amp; Rapid Antigen test testing clinic - Antigen came back Negative  
1 Rapid PCR another drive - Positive  


I figured positive. drive 11 hours home state case something happens family drop food/diabetic supplies hotel door). get Mono Antibody Treatment Urgent Care (bc I'm diabetic). cost $2500 I'm American Live Canada US insurance. US 


Then today get results clinic took PCR Antigen test above, PCR negative.  


So know think. I'm super stressed, worried (but less worried bc im double vaxed got treatment), even know actually Covid. feel bad livestock miss medicine qrazy people took Obviously said worst case. working relatively small company good people chill climate. change matter explaining made progress days much easier people actually saw there, working. situation, making hours, I'd probably start sweating. Cause point option either working unpaid overtime worry next conversation supervisor. Neither things look forward free time. Thanks providing example Tiny_Rick_C137 asked for, bacon loving friend told no. haven’t seen least 15 years probably. Uh that’s thing. You’re making head. one taking vaccine Trump lost, they’re taking think help. I’m wondering you’re actually dense you’re trolling you’re bored.  really work well stop barking. Maybe don’t open slack you’re taking shit lol. Replies wait 5-10 minutes. Wow yeah might reason higher icu around long enough various outbreaks eliminated. I'm thinking getting tested. I've allergy-like symptoms last days, noticed yesterday senses taste smell seem weaker. still smell taste, feels fainter. family town last week go eat tourist-y activities. 

Specific COVID questions:

1. mucus usually green/yellow, clear too?
2. smell/taste side effect happen once, like absolutely smell taste, gradual acute version, like lessened smell taste?
3. get test? Multiple studies shown n95, kn95, etc. much effective blocking aerosol particles directions surgical masks access surgical mask less worried getting (vaccinated, low risk, etc.), surgical mask better nothing. could would considered fudging hours. Hi everyone, parents Republican want take vaccine. I'm 14 years old would like take it. reasoning vaccine FDA approved know long term effects could be. really want get vaccinated, anyone help think ways talk them? Thank you. vaccines much working designed.

So vaccines Polio, Rubella etc work much better? developed decades ago, get 100% protected life. Excuse me. It’s bird masks protect bad air Missouri cut two months surge happened. know really undermined push COVID vaccines? deliberately concealing obfuscating data related vaccine performance.

The knowledge vaccinated typically far milder case COVID un-vaxed important point, gets lost people feel like government engaged deception trickery get people vaccinated. natural human response feeling deception reject offered. people hate used car salesmen (or ""too-slick"" salesperson). work environment want people working site. particularly want someone access production SWIFT Target-2 system home transfer €200M wrong place. people work near production in?

I turned one project would mean travelling staying another city middle crisis. company said would get paperwork me, turned would nowhere near production. travel? turned favour current project.  seems like people still got clue vaccine does.

Maybe we're used vaccine like Polio, Rubella, Mumps etc essentially 100% effective life? none tailored variants yet.... based understanding mRNA vaccines would fairly easy reconfigure . matter production &amp; mass distribution FDA reluctant go route. Unless 3rd shot proves ineffective particular variant (which case, even Lamda mutation) they'll advocating boosters. It’s going 8 months currently.

Source: software dev manager, full remote 2 years. fought old company 6 years enabling full remote. gen-x CTO VP arch wanted butts seats 9am sharp. Religious exemptions ridiculous; there’s scripture written doctrine forbids them. Medical exemptions tough sell, well, nothing vaccines research requires pharma certify pts vaccinated—save naming distinct allergies distinct vaccine elements. 

New York State others done away exemptions completely. known “exemption advocates” licensure challenged. 

Ironically, jabs like HPV meningitis required many states college entry—including Texas. seems hypocritical excuse significant series childhood jabs require those. Thank much reply, hope convince them! Appreciate response. think lot comes individual’s personal situation.

I’m 6 months second shot, go back work mask optional school couple weeks, kid young vaccinated home. benefit booster got preventing mild moderate case give child outweigh risks getting couple months early. 

If childless worked remotely I’d definitely wait recommended 8 months. trolling something.

We active dialogue 1:1’s what’s keeping happy need grow team. know person, motivates me, know them. It’s way know incentivizes them, beyond money, keep coming back work, continue make working team intriguing them. get paid anywhere. makes stick quality work respect. 

I’m sorry different experience, really am. I’m confident team it’s performance I’m constantly getting open honest feedback. see changes see action desire. see make changes adjustments. Beyond that, I’m sure else effective leader do.  weeks work 35 hours. nothing could make use last 5 hours? ask because, someone equally qualified you, could provide output 35 hours you, also willing put minimum 40 hours per week? Would unreasonable replace you? Start reading  personal risk thing. knows future holds need plan life. Disney couple weeks ago. 

If MI cases NY cases stay means natural immunity vaccination seem help variants. seriously, entire situation America mostly group people, nearly half nation. I’ve applied many these, far rejected all. fair, I’ve applying equivalent positions tech companies never worked tech industry, may working uncle works Nintendo. beginning think Harvard Yale grad disqualify positions responsibility power. 🤔 TBH brave enough, really interested particular position, try get touch someone might working even know them. know can't speak everyone personally love random people find social media ask open position. always put referral (though state personally know it) company least guarantees interview. lot Hep B COVID concert. GNR Axel randos? oh god “it’s flu” — flu doesn’t weird things like long covid, doesn’t overwhelm hospitals, etc
i know sub doesn’t allow much p*l*t*cs, isn’t simply individual choice. poor messaging, lack quality education everyone, histories medical abuse certain peoples, need poor people take time sick, etc play role coercing people certain things. hiring? most, it’s actually hours collected there’s typically buffer percentage deficiencies incentives hitting budgeted hourly values. 

Some firms aggressive hourly goals. That’s really becomes cultural question want live want work, timekeeper. Assuming joke, end. Find company want work for, start scanning employees. Find people job title interested in, send message saying so. Something like ""hi name, I'm name, I'm reaching regarding role x. I've always interested x, I've grown skillset around x z. Would open quick chat? I'd love learn experience role get advice things improve candidacy"". yep, found list online. thank you! Could obesity/diabetes also play contributing factor?
Kids UK typically fit Americans. odd though change minds fast, part knows vaccine helps can't bring get late. Or, maybe figure they're already sick, worried potential side effects vaccine? would walk 3 blocks back house coffee cup, distance parking garage office signify start day. 

15 months later, don’t need anymore, helped early on. Full time remote work net positive polution wise, doubter full time remote working norm. probably major thing couple years pandemic over, see things going back status quo, maybe partial remote work option.

As converting offices living spaces happen least happen fast. Companies buildings get lot revenue leases even pandemic companies looking office space (I know since company lease new space). convert office building residental need lot work, building walls, installing doors, replacing windows, etc. 

What I'm trying say even office rental sits empty months might make financial sense sink money try either switch normal rental units try sell appartments. last ditch effort. # G want place yourself.  might finally able get second dose country residence month, pandemic completely destroyed me. there’s hope future many selfish twats won’t incur slightest inconvenience good community. don’t know society get past this, get past much damage last year done mental health. Fuck. Prompted donations pretty much businesses. Disney wants people parks theaters, American Airlines wants people planes, Hilton wants people hotels.

People focus way much corruption pharmaceuticals, seem forget industries involved corruption. yet fiddle Honestly I’m certain good. Like I’m keeping people safe allowing work home turning place go escape work new workplace psychologically can’t healthy. headlines say bosses worried exploited somehow future. It’s like work email phone you’re always expected answer emails regardless work hours.  job, brought us back office months ago said they’d “work flexible-work options.” Turns “flexible-work options” option WFH one day week. 😐 hate negative encourage report person don’t surprised nothing comes it. nurse shortages country it’s highly unlikely anything done. It’s sad it’s also reason don’t see blanket covid vaccine mandate hospitals - though might change tomorrow. 

There many people close retirement nearly enough folks wings replace them. It’s sad. Sooo glad “team” bet would surprised honest feedback really looked like. want people forced back office benefit

It's benefit everyone. work business, technically part team organization group collective goal. Meeting in-person, sociologically speaking, huge benefits goals. could've done college projects via email, still met student union. local book club could organize entirely Facebook, go library. less moving parts, interactive, always work real time, importantly interpersonal interactions important individual well. That's in-office *should* expected outside certain careers. 

Only certain people thrive WFH environments, people would thrive office environment well, far efficient everyone platform.

What probably see future mixed model. x-office hours mandatory days fulfill, rest flexible WFH drove rural Oregon saw virtually zero masks tons anti-mask signs bumper stickers. pathetic. data many breakthroughs wind hospital dead? Companies embrace remote work information employees seen authoritarian dinosaurs. would even wary corporations full remote policy heart it. Humanity 10-20 years traditional 9-5 work employment becomes optional middle class. know cyberneticist roboticost access world's best AI system running date (OpenAI GPT3 Codex). company forces non remote employment final hour capitalism lose employees (which still required grow transition company post automation world) Yep read article. see quote article. see quotes ""Is actual evidence COVID-19 vaccine boost helps? much yet"" ""David Dowdy, infectious disease epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University, notes apparent decline protection could causes, including changes individual behavior rate transmission community.""

I personally would rather someone else get first shot get third. white, privileged, however black either. 


If white America gets ""the good life"" goal everyone equal access treatment. mission accomplished treat everyone like shit racism over. Similar unionization, goal increase quality life Americans means providing privileges enjoyed certain groups. Remote needs stay. Companies need either offer 100% remote Hybrid options hard time retaining folks. may bit well. believe supposed 60% capacity place ended full. probably tens thousands. definitely make Disney last, thing reduce risk spreading virus (as said even normal times would done last anyway).

It really depends COVID case counts. there’s high COVID spread Northeast (which probably wouldn’t happen since way better restrictions Florida), cancel portion trip rearrange flights Disney rest places. it’s pretty low like early summer (more likely case), keep section trip. Personally think 5-6 days Disney World probably going catch COVID (if end getting it, hopefully obviously), 2 weeks Northeast cities.

We probably know 2-3 months cancel based direction cases going.

But definitely, Disney last. That’s sure. extra hour get commuting office blessing government continues sit hands. School starts  
couple weeks mask mandates, course, vaccination  
under twelves.  Door Dash teachers. Teach hour two next house. Covid exactly dangerous thing situation Tbf you’re great job explaining it. totally get you’re saying. depends expected outcome aligned employer. Yeah, thing mystifies happy send jobs off-shore never see remote people timezones prohibit easy live communication. let on-shore people work remotely? know working?? Um, way off-shore. getting shit done?? Yes? good.

My job help teams work together effectively efficiently last year half, worked several large corporations, I've seen effective, efficient teams know work together. communicate needed, available working hours, deliver what's needed. I’m advocating getting vaccine. Get vaccine, vastly improves chances mild illness least period time. red flag goes mind see articles refer breakthrough infections rare even uncommon point. seems dishonest think type dishonesty reporting causes confusion damages peoples trust. 

I sorry say beginning seem like ending pandemic vaccines may achievable even majority people get fully vaccinated. Time tell. even dramatic break zip code. zip 70% vaccination; zips county 30%. Guess see masks? See Phil Valentine example do.    Sorry hear that. armature advice something like this, treat like would type injury. sprain ankle, go physio specific recovery excersize, work general strengthening. brain incredibly malleable things permanent. I'd suggest popping Neuro subreddits asking excersizes would best brain. say that? get it, I’m unable see family member without flying greyhound bussing it, would put vulnerable elderly person risk. don’t think worrying traveling right unreasonable complete isolation. Agreed. I’m Gwinnett I’m baffled people here. heart breaks hospitals dealing dumbasses still think shit isn’t real.  Respectfully, irritated flippant comment “Lol…have seen death stats?” shouldn’t care situation simply hasn’t child massacre. things considered. second response likely reactionary. think original point comment remains same. first sentence question? 

A lot states eliminated religious exemption, medical exemptions every childhood jab rare. 

I live New York State. Neither allowed more. colleagues working contact tracing centers. extremely labor intensive low yield. People hard get ahold of, remember they've been. point, they've infected large number, maybe someone met street, someone saw casually without contact info. really useful already quarantining people (coming overseas such) work first cases disease contagious pre-symptomatically. Yes think it’s based logistics science, hand Israel think European countries using mRNA vaccine using Pfizer, Pfizer effectiveness infection dropped faster Moderna according Mayo Clinic study. it’s still holding well severe infection (hospitalization) won’t serious consequences organized fashion. recommendation Moderna, that's what's studied, matter get Pfizer. Love it. don’t forget regular get together. Without in-person, non-work-related meet ups, companies struggle high performing teams - least way define today. baffles definitely what's happening live (PA).

I think lot people stopped paying attention completely honestly. think vaccinated good stopped following news entirely. know, I'm pro- science pro-vaccine. personally know many age group - healthy adults became sick: one long haul Covid 1.5 years later. triathlete health never recovered. 😢 It’s political theater. know realistically lot schools aren’t able meet guideline stay quiet order schools remain open. Yup. There's lot restaurants solely marketing towards business travelers expense accounts. bank people $250 dinner budgets plan spend every dollar even steak really costs $10 make bottle wine marked 500%.

Those places exist anyone business travelers expense accounts. business districts, near convention centers etc. That's make money.

Those places hemorrhaging right unless get people offices convince businesses face meetings need happen. Well, fair, planes probably pre-existing comorbidities. Could explain? trying argue people tell think “how know it’s less two years” I've seen past year half 5 up, including NC statewide one. Software Manager Fortune 500 company. can’t trust employees WFH, problem. get vaccine within first 24 hours bitten

You get rabies vaccine time bitten. *should* get within 24 hours minimize risk, days even months, still better get all. Rabies dormant months long get vaccine symptoms appear, effective.


Just want correct misinformation case discourages someone seeking treatment. can't find article source ""40% cases breakthrough cases"" sure referring to. couple articles say 50%+ ""serious"" cases breakthrough cases, usually means hospitalized, still rare. absolutely maddening. Thank you. Commenting access quickly. right said ""all"" current data. already clarified using data Canada above, comment thread, seems weird fixated still. lot people heavily invested commercial real estate fight transition. first two vaccine shots Moderna, get 3rd one (booster) Pfizer Moderna? Gottleib Thoughts:

Good News: "" south, evidence epidemic starting slow, day day cases starting decline.""

Bad News: ""Over 40,000 kids staffers schools gotten infected COVID south. schools reopen elsewhere, could become focal points community transmission, environments safe children, can't control large outbreaks happening settings."" that’s 1:1s for. meet staff 1:1 every week. Talk personal lives, things going. adjusting. talk policies company. name it. Trust utmost importance. someone unwillingly participates something, I’d unhappy. I’d rather use time something feel productive. actually based team feel physically? C level people realize employees grown-ups really need managers productive. It’s terrible petty relish screams outrage may hear week various institutions enable vaccine mandates. 

And person voted Libertarian last election. Haha like enjoy CoL adjustment. boss keeps excess that's works. don’t want go attack company forced us hands deck. need butthurt man. guys good job too! Let's happy NZ finally catching up, lot people putting lot effort make happen really good speed. Micro manager time toilet / lunch break disagree. 

They also sit 1 min late work, ignore OT’s.  bright side, would mean even anti-maskers modern day pandemic could end since Spanish flu did? Obviously one killed lot people least end... fucking sad. Hey ""bosses,"" this: remote work general strike. I’m litigation (not big firm) think rates generally tend bit lower. Think big, RFID tag bathroom app sense there. course would lead employer tracking bathroom time WFH. I'm definitely happier working purely home.

No face face time co-workers, house feels like office started getting stress dreams work, ADHD means less structured work environment actively damages ability work, everything online means every time need someone help sending message many people many messages day easy miss some.

I personally say good everyone. I’m panicked point, cautious. suggesting parents panicked? got original Pfizer shots CVS too, first time getting vaccinated surprisingly smooth. appointments super hard come too, system perfect.

Planning go back third well. Feel good far it? Makes sense thanks already made permanent.

Our team actually productive working home able lease half building (We still teams need there) another company.

We've even started hiring outside state, makes extremely happy cuz that's one stop closer us able move Florida. awesome you’ll get rewarded

We know know know bullshit without question, crap managers bosses say.

I pay rise 3 years, get exceptional performance reviews every year. try keep mind possibility lingering symptoms charachteristic virus, even common cold bronchitis.   Im totally okay going office.

But like wouldn’t want forced WFH. don’t want forced go office.

My girlfriend office person, goes office, comes home happier, socialises more, keeps better routine, etc.

For me, it’s opposite, I’m happier home, im productive, keep better routine home.

I want flexible time zone based situation. wanna live city, 20minutes office small apartment go office everyday go drinks super socialially active? - GO IT.

You want live countryside 4 hours office come 1x per quarter team bonding. Great.

So long work time zone team (if needed) business isn’t paying extra accommodate within reasonable amount, live anywhere want. managers gonna lose jobs needed. longer term healthy use work center social life, though. Yup, cold blooded animal cruelty supporter here. It’s mainly numbers thing. kids getting sick, isn’t impact majority kids getting sick, even symptoms milder them.

When everyone’s getting sick same, becomes bigger problem. ADD. I'm able take advantage tendency hyperfocus home distractions. sounds like really comes people's home situations like. stupid thing managers directors worried on

Fat old boomer managers verge retirement paying mortgage worried business waking realizing needed.

NOT FUN WORRYING JOB SUDDENLY HUH!? QUIT AVOCADO TOAST! Victoria, BC *The Villages* Florida Canada.   really good point. Yea upper whit class area it’s rare see white orphans. Minority orphans aren’t new problem. 

Doesn’t make right either way. joke, truth it, need routine. walk office, actually getting bit help break work. found hard consistently work home. Amen this. Shit happens sometimes requires OT commute lingering softens blow. punch em give stink eye. ah fuck! there's rules! there's rules everyone, go home even try! revolution due rules! Caucasian gets convicted, governor pardon him.  good thing, it’s shown far productive. reason bosses want employees workstations building control get away bullshit normally legally can’t Yea one less thing control losing it. ? What?

1) men can’t harassed?

2) commenter say led believe annoying chitchat harassment?? Says guy clearly doesn’t wear mask 8 hours day job. danger could devolve anecdote bias. think leads real strong chance people stop looking actual numbers. No, that’s fail lazy managers whose job solely deal problems like chose deal individual slacker. I'm finishing terminal degree* working PT I've keeping eye out. get real way I'm going look orgs get it. Kudos forward- thinking. definitely pay off.

*quiet sobbing lol  ADHD almost everything acts distraction. much easier stay focused I'm office. I've also found lack good team management make difficult collaborate efficiently well.

The idea working home rest career honestly pretty terrifying. know I'd say *disability* exactly sure feels like one sometimes. wish could get excited everyone else working home can't. I'm knowledgeable honestly remember people back 2020 refuting idea masks nothing virions go straight cloth masks referencing COVID mostly spreads much much larger droplets rather tiny aerosols, understanding whether COVID spread happening aerosols vs droplets changed tracks thoughts effectiveness cloth masks also change possible Delta, sooner start wearing goggles better Working 20+ years safely say real promotions folks change companies. may different non-IT jobs however mean say office days week good... something employees may want consider highest priority. Michigan Gas Brakes video beach done last year, one bodies packed together Wave 2 pandemic. gabe newell valve steam fame put best ability crank code hats improved ability launch new products innovate hampered.

i feel like office work today cranking kind work lot people WFH. come work together projects outline go back crank work.  They’re saying like it’s bad thing haha gonna nearly impossible ever figure breakthrough cases, even people previous infections. wife early last year exposed numerous positive people didn’t get thereafter… she? much milder case. may November would nearly indistinguishable cold reason question headache don’t recall ever getting headache migraine concurrently cold.

Now obviously we’re vaccinated. wife thinks may stomach bug recently. bad cold (tested negative). We’re rural area, work home, gonna get tested every single minor sniffles. It’s gonna nearly impossible track positive breakthroughs vaccines may prevent symptoms.

If subsequent time it’s contracted yields fewer symptoms tons people walking around idea. worries! wanted make clear think vaccines work. even Canada 70% vaxxed still seeing case rates climb. reason get vaccinated, since numbers without vaccines would explosive. think first thing mind reading question is, really trouble focusing? guess focus seem less usual, get interrupted less, theoretically keep focused.

But yeah, like guy said, person work person that's billing usually. put long took let someone else sort out. feeling guilt never enters it. exist go meetings tell teams do? Yeah. Probably obsolete soon.

Yeah, getting directives higher ups, deciding implement directive directing actual work actually job. worked people India, say timezone differences big issue. It’s 12h difference, literally night day. Everytime need explain something, get response, clarify point, you’ll see delays. lot businesses tried move workforce India save money, realize spend time redoing job. much simpler alternative hiring within USA, remote workers, still save ton money without dealing timezone differences miscommunication We're talking offices, schools. Kids absolutely need socialization found in-person settings. even then, oftentimes abusive types home-school kids regardless. So.... There's podcast I've listening called ""It Could Happen Here"" goes detail bad climate change could be. Season 1 talks second civil war US, newer episodes climate change focused. episodes share one thing common though: future bleak, likely get worse. yeah, Pre-2020 living probably dead, covid sense look climate change, increasing political instability, rise neofascism, gradual ""crumbling"" world society.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: r/collapse subreddit talks lot topics ideas discussed Could Happen Here. Might worth checking wanna absolutely hope future. I've decided repurpose commute time (almost 8hrs/wk) toward meeting folks age making new friends. working out, pandemic way worse waistline freshman year! Received third shot yesterday making reservation last Tuesday. one line CVS arrived one else got shot waited 15 minutest afterward. one person asked could get vaccine walk-in. informed pharmacy's supply walk-ins used day. 3 PM. Sorry hear feeling exhausted.

Baseline background: immunity (whether via past infection vax) never meant person impervious infection; always meant they're likely beat infection get... let infection stats throw off.

General stats: \~2% hospitalizations among vaxxed, \~1% die vaxxed... like 100 times less likely die even get breakthrough infection.

Behaviorally, nothing changed: outdoor safer in, less exposure time safer more, distance better close, mask better mask.

&amp;#x200B;

On breakthrough infections happen: lots lots people stopped acting though we're middle pandemic, restrictions lifted places... chances spread pre-vax times. 

If you, someone close high risk (over 65 immunocompromised), go out; otherwise, stay course fine. (I doctor) Yes, thank you. Lol lot managers finding without anything remote. also logistically smart. Many us got vaccinated period far doses places get much likely rush back get booster soon okay (8 months). means places giving vaccines may see *huge* spike people trying get booster within month period, time year viruses tend spread easily (colder months). problem, what’s point fancy corner office office pleabs can’t look jealous open office bill pens. worries appreciate report... definitely informs educates. micromanage work home? People get life friends socialize people actually choose around. I'm consultant small amount collaboration job (not including interfacing customers), also track hours "".1"" interval definitely efficient too. Microsoft Teams eliminates need reserve room discussion, I'm discussion single click mouse.

The area seems deficeit comes training. harder on-board new person job, technical, beginning often asking lot questions. imagine would hard want bug people Teams know anyone.

But obvious solution make feel comfortable let know reach time. first time I’ve seen “siloed” context it’s perfect description.

Software dev here, much situation. delivery estimates (overly conservative) first couple months. seem 40% productive.  Never mind great day Last month, quit job wouldn’t commit sorry future WFH plan, employees left wondering every day when/if they’d called back. started new 100% remote forever job couple weeks ago. took pay cut, feel like worth peace mind get strung along (and think old company eventually call people back, many fuddy duddies charge there). knew would drag long I'd traded tiny condo house. deal constant isolation I'd rather space feel cramped. Moving work condo huge burden, case files work equipment clutter home This. professor save $1,000 year university parking fees.  people productive happy self-managing home, points useless middle managers actually are. That's real reason push ""back office."" work small software company two months. company heavily impacted pandemic they're tangential food service. pretty astonished started found *they'd working office entire fucking time.* started, replacing guy one half department. couple weeks that, guy left. me. owner ancient, micromanaging software developer.

I've automated fucking many insanely unnecessarily manual processes saved many hours senseless busywork two months still get stern talking-to close certain number help desk tickets day like...homie, one opened tickets week everything's working lot smoothly without human hands fucking everything up. asked chance go remote accommodations would need would take machine I'm already using home VPN systems access could set zero dollars set call-forwarding phone system. Nope! Instead, given 1.1% raise. owner company millionaire. everything opening back *profit* soaring due minimal staff keeping everything going. 

I start new job 30th. teach Zoom 8 hours apparently done cubicle. Ridiculous! google virologists. I’m sure there’s ton thousand universities. 

One bound happy discuss hypothesis. 

I still think you’re confusing viruses vs bacteria.  Ok, sorry confusion there! No, said neurological damage occur even asymptomatic covid infections. struggling understand talking about. part got America meddle Frances covid measures. However Americans interest France past reporting current events. Yeah I've calling telemedicine everyday, inhaler + steroids we'll see go. sleeping position strangely... lying flat chest, rest head yeah. changes day day trying find comfortable sleeping position also overheat in. sure. lingering effects? That's wrong... shows, said, statistically likely 0.9 1.2

Making statement likely one misrepresentation data. think past year really difficult parents expected work home raising children, don’t think that’s fair way think working home moving forward. Raising/educating children full-time job treated such. Children cared stay home parent, nanny, daycare. school appropriate age. 

There definitely reasons people might happy WFH - lack office space, social isolation live alone - parenting working likely improve time.   You’ll fine even get it, try safe be. former boss previous company said “if home office full time, done overseas”. saw HR benefits operation go shore realized warning us coming. theory yes, however, markets competitive lawyers/accountants/consultants can't eat hours like maintain clients firms it. 

Especially since professionals offer free consultations, people get different price estimates job choose want go. Early heard lot essentially asthma inhalers helping coughing fits. Kinda makes sense, since symptoms similar. Trouble breathing, restricted airways, coughing. actually don’t! like pool like read books don’t home. said earlier post I’ve coming 20 years. needed place thought could feel like normal again. I'm still unsure that's going make ton difference, 3rd shot. Texas Governor Abbott third booster couple weeks got covid. 2 weeks shot 3, still breakthrough case.

People still get it. understanding last line defense first line masks social distancing.  Right? HARD hire good people. I've hiring binge really good people getting snapped fast. Australia? No.

NSW definitely, Victoria maybe.

Other states still working way back already returned 0 cases (QLD, WA, ACT, NT, TAS).

It currently difficult travel New South Wales Western Australia travel London Western Australia need border pass essentially granted normally live WA (and nowhere stay NSW) truck driver (essential), member parliament, military, police similar government functions. London WA ""only"" requires expensive flight hotel quarantine. finally took twice-canceled teip. Domestic. drove. al glad did. Trump longer president. Time let go hold new people charge accountable. Depends place. ones I've seen suburbs survive closest place office serve pretty low quality food get via proximity. Workers half hour eat want drive far  Exactly this.

There’s occasional person convinced data explanation biology, 9/10 move another excuse experience  WHOOO HOOO!! would agree theory there's mechanism way possible vaccine make virus evolve faster potentially worse symptoms. Let's talk coronavirus, general. Could virus certain characteristics vaccine make happen? curious, would think possible least theory? Lmao welcome free market assholes Yeah look like cosplaying Bane people give weird looks reason... Thank you!! live here. Honestly can't remember last time saw someone wearing mask wife. Granted work home get much, yeah, scary First week back office one people team filed complaint H.R conversations people loud. know people havnt seen year half . One man’s draconian another man’s rational response.

That ""other"" man - meds chance? office home easy focus. Working kitchen table would stupid people need better space. *if work work space*, way better off.

I could never focus office. many people, much chatter, think bother something important talk about.

Now, matter job, could see less productive without whip back.  contrary fucking joke. Stop paying attention it'll go away. dumb ass stuck middle city moved stop commuting, going office next year earliest. smallpox one time shot covered life people, including myself, might bit onboard vaccine protocols. Fact matter is, pandemic different anything modern society delt before. Hence, original statement earlier make overbearing decisions.

It's people like compare apple oranges say eat they're fruit.  cio bummed forced go along permanent work home. I'm never ever going back office kinda sucks. They’ll cut overseas cheaper. Boo fuckin hoo. Seriously. days over. Good. states mandates needed gonna mandates cares tbh Damn lines daughter rough. father, can’t imagine leaving kids fatherless didn’t get free vaccine. brutal. times simply changed. Anyone doubts new normal (especially corporate/office type jobs) delusional. Thank brave getting vaccinated. Exactly. Leave crates one spot, run away, God’s sake. Project management, mostly. Lots talking people moving information back forth right person. lot background field though. 

I surprised ability project management coming technical/clinical field. always associated basically fields need PMs.  think end causing businesses people leave certain states happens long term. They’re right, find equally skilled workers less overseas remote. technology. Remote work viable. Good. solves many societal ills frees many hours people's time. two kinda mutually exclusive? way employers make work suck less, they'd done compete. Nobody's going 4 day work weeks 5th day worth paid productivity day off. Give us day employer saves day's pay, still pays base costs (insurance, benefits, certifications, taxes benefits covered employer, office equipment sitting idle...) Even live--which quite doubtful--how much permanent damage done lungs? fear we're going generation people unable return pre-pandemic lives.  well give us explanation....  Nah, *real* problem someone might realize need quite many managers.  tf managers hard working person?  Absolutely. world anecdotes valuable actual surveys data? 

And want me? got shot. wear mask. keep distance. point want clicks articles. Can’t us feeling hopeful safer vaccines, that’s good business. Yeah, obviously can't vaccinate instantly. That's I'm reasoning might impossible go back normalcy help vaccines, maybe things become worse rather better time goes on. know could still beginning covid's potential. could start become worse every single year.

This virus different characteristics viruses. viruses spreading fast enough, developing resistance enough killed victims fast etc, possible contain. Neat.  boss encourages everyone bring work appropriate drink snack weekly online meetings. office would often local coffee shop takes place that. work specific stuff 1/2-3/4 meeting time everyone catches visits remaining time. Granted team small works better might larger team, gone long way toward keeping people connected someone outside household BS bit with. someone thinking career change career pretty intensive stressful day day, may ask work? news rumbling mRNA vaccines quite bit. 27 (and I'm assuming male) second highest risk group myocarditis mRNA. Still likely, common far side effects go (1/5000 - 1/15000). I'm similar range though reaction, hope solve issue next round. understand myocarditis actually pretty common athletes, good shape deterrent there.

I male, yes. know common, thought hundred cases millions administered doses. idea pretty common wish health system guys do. I'm hook thousand dollars something like happens (and ""good"" health plan!) US budget happening every years. Naive assume US - sorry that!

Our health system pros cons too. I've waited 4+ months see dermatologist example. thankful pay anything though. I'm dual citizen Canada US know sometimes budgeting things like stressful (especially insurance). say non-typical reaction mRNA vaccine get another dose, doctors decide whether that's relevant anymore. Sorry go this.

I'll ask cardiologist next time see him. sucks go it, guess. going understand. want Buttsinseats, pay extra privilege. People choices now. got breakthrough infection, know caught it? wearing masks? Shit's got worried work public give shit. Indeed. there's evidence *didn't* consider this. possible that, balance, reasonably ethically considered best approach given situation.

It clear, awhile, many people longer mask situation (c.f. Florida Texas), others longer mask situations perceive believable risk (outdoors, already vaxxed, around friends, etc.). Given this, CDC may reasonably assessed taking hard-line approach masking everyone would little effect, time losing opportunity incentivize vaccine uptake.

With hindsight, one might conclude approach goad much vaccination CDC would liked. However, despite common narrative, evidence that, itself, CDC's messaging regarding masking unvaxxed people contributed meaningfully spread covid. Indeed, recent studies showing little positive effect mask mandates.

So CDC's approach might ineffectual, hindsight may represented missed opportunity take different approach know would produced better results. there's indication recommendation reasonable ethically made time put forth. Humans get parasite infections well, relatively rarer healthy people first world.  types articles come up, assumed reader understands scope exclude people work person. ain't ask figure out. wouldn’t extrapolate workplaces. workplaces see positivism. offices see increased dysfunction, suspect factors play. Keeping people home massive benefit fight back global warming, far fewer miles driven every year billions people around world. would corporations give shit that?! *You would think*. told manager position ""eliminated"" give salary pay. knows everyone crock full shit. He's best based integrity work ethic, calling everyone shit stumbling learning position hopefully make next year better team RE: raises titles.


He knows bullshit. knows he's taken advantage of. We've talked know worst thing could happen fire him, Canada gets decent severance unemployment really got fed him. husband long talks he's doing, needs, need break make sure burn out, built whole sub-section budget take unpaid time runs everything needs break.


He wants manager title put resume bare minimum. actively looking work, want jump next thing unless offers responsibility money. best wife keep grounded happy, he's best protect employees. tough situation, he/we can.  lunch. much easier healthier lunch/coffee/snacks home! hope going back working remotely becomes common. difference would make traffic congestion air pollution. need there's office, that's worried.  actually became less productive. going office alone bang work bounce. It’s glorious. Same. Risk adverse companies, particularly strong unions probably waiting this. replying absurd statement early vaxx passports. 

People acting like vaccines haven’t prerequisite attending school certain events before. Since covid endemic now, it’s time get timeline. I'm expecting ton plague doctors Ren Fest least next years. Tech already went outsourcing. take hard work people talk like you, work hours, think business way compatible do. Outsourcing tried eliminate jobs couldn't. Fauci literally said effective. ok. realise remote work norm, hire people live cheaper places. Ha I'm wife scenario, right Metra tickets! Even commute spent working, still save time able pick groceries household stuff lunch breaks, huge win overall. one Czech republic. igm positive symptoms negative PCR rapid test . Absolutely. (empty) office week recently much less inclined put extra time knowing 35 minute drive waiting Yeah I’m you. friends/acquaintances life know caring kind people bent minds vaccines. keep thinking misinformation people getting made go antivax path? workers don’t go work person know I’m important based size location office? Well, tiktok figured kids space making functionality useful. thing good watching thots post booty shaking memes rap songs I'll let someone convert gif vid repost it. Thanks. think there's valid concerns general doubt information received official sources. Since beginning virus. First official messaging virus big deal even thought seeing fast spread, initial amount deaths, see could've containable all. obvious. Second official message masks protect Covid. Okay, maybe underlying reason want people hoard masks. That's totally understandable, government I'd probably same. catch is, whatever information official sources release that, censor matter, could ""white lies"" stemming very, many different motivations, white lie may even want purposely sound confident really convince masses go plan. involves politics, money, many motivations play. impossible tell information trust essentially.

Then time passed, masks, officials confident effective reducing Covid spread. maybe, may not, think actual clarity that. Even Redditors confident masks work, compiled list 60+ studies supposed definitively prove nay sayers masks definitely effective. Looking closer, find single study reached conclusion covid specifically. results directed covid inconclusive. point time (there may evidence masks), seem single legitimate evidence masks effective. I'm anti mask myself, always wear masks, obligatory, think even theory could effective makes sense so. must new working world. freed budget bigger bonus C level bosses. lot money food get fired punished coming work covid... Managers directors afraid company owners wont need fire them. owners realise dont need pay much money managers intelligent workers self better time managment. worthy points, wish office culture healthier we'd agree less problematic. Office culture problems hit employees ways can't articulate managers effectively, show shut up.

Man agree points, I've done WFH 10 years office 10 that, I'm good 25%.... office even consideration awful, distant, expensive reach, dangerous winter... get there, culture makes little use office. examples wearing seatbelt, getting tetanus vaccination. things personal decision remains personal consequences.

Driving regulations (which brought up) different category, say, another example behaviors (or be) left individual preference. Getting vaccine vote vaccine passports lol get absurd statement Yes, have. meet requirements. first nurse suggested “the vaccine may given him.” WTF?!?

Was one staff elderly home lived said that, nurse. usual comes staff don’t care. even article breakthrough cases said something effect ""Anecdotes say evidence ever could"" comes breakthrough cases me, that's dangerous mindset. minor social elements coworkers, guess?

Yeah, social aspect work lost WFH, everything else positive severely outweights it. ...they didn’t literally mean chickenpox, clearly hyperbole first opened vaccinations helping mother register shot good computers/websites (also, whose dumbass idea make vaccination appointments elderly people require going like 5-6 different websites check available slots?!). sites across NY even suburbs going Albany completely booked except Bronx. ended driving could get shot reasonable timeframe.

We got almost everyone else waiting get shot Manhattanites taken subway there. mom actually asked nurse giving shot whether mostly people coming elsewhere nurse said even get husband take shot fact literally giving shots every day-they Black husband distrusting healthcare system even though wife giving shots still trust it. mean logically makes sense, since husband would believe wife pick special bad bottles inject specific people. people they've told lives trust healthcare system happens years ago, grow hearing message hard get trust vaccine now. That’s overwhelmingly popular opinion employers modern countries kind arrangement common.

Fewer sick days, increased productivity, greater employee loyalty, less employee fatigue, list goes on. Sadly, author probably thinks it’s daringly cynical incisive. Oh, people voted. voted willingness unwillingness take vaccine. 

And crest fourth wave pandemic hardly “too early.” Many vaccinated people would love get back normal. Hell, I’d like cross border non-essential reasons next summer. I’d prefer time unvaccinated morons say whether happen not. Meanwhile dad breakthrough case symptom minor cough nasal congestion, even lose smell taste.

I might point 50+ field workers around country exactly that.

Anyway, shame, job sounds great, culture commute aren't. There’s big difference friendly forced spend free time coworkers parties, happy hours, running meetings longer catch everyone’s kids (this specifically happened many times last role). 

We could get work done quicker efficiently WFH (in office roles, all). leave time hanging meet groups, bars, chosen friends, family. always friendly everyone default IMO, you’re entitled coworker’s time. company announced Friday looking March 1st return office date. 2 week initial run 2020, July 1st, September, January 2021, April, September, 2022.

Middle management worried shit jobs actually useless. ones want go back office. reason pay rent utilities building ton jobs work home extrovert hate open office plans.

The real thing though conversation hinges entirely productivity - worker happiness. fuck even society thing determining 80% population lives makes produce highest number widgets per week? Totally agreed! I'm kind space technical/peer reviews professional collaboration done pretty much identically whether we're remote not, work done people around country anyway. said, varies environment. Well hospitalizations also growing within vaccinated, least Israel high rate unvaccinated - seems gap getting smaller groups. Meeting in-person, psychological speaking, huge disadvantages. Interruptions, office drama, social anxiety, etc. ""open office"" floor plans follow qualities talk utterly fail.

You completely discount half population introverted. Socialization work/effort introverts office environments. take less work/effort, others take more. universally takes effort energy socialize certain people thrive WFH environments, people would thrive office environment well

Bullshit. OMG yes. useless watercooler gossip hear anymore. happy WFH hear everyone's political ""thoughts"", recaps last evening's cable news shows, whatever religious arguments people wanted get day. Good riddance! dont know. reporter asked Fauci said thinks so, data T-cells hard measure. states. corporations realizing half workforce unvaccinated bad bottom line.  work tech. also depends company medic calls ER…which informs her/him full diversion, informs patient still insist ER….

The virus isn’t going away. maybe it’s ability harm us nonstop is. point airports pretty well controlled (except ultrarich private flights perhaps).

There far less control checking container ships crew. headlines nearly every winter hospitals filling flu patients. priorities dont match HELP. would love work office home. currently work factory absolutely hate it. Im worried ill still hsve lockdowns happen. anything do? 2 year degree liberal arts, 7 years hospitality experience small winery tasting room, lot interest computer work. Im thinking becoming flight attendant maybe online coding bootcamp? Help :[ Good Thank you. Unfortunately company strong arming everyone back office. Teams employees ever field (remote) go office well. 

There significant turnover say least. 

We absolutely crushed productivity well handful hundred thousand employees. don’t matter managers concerned losing control. Many countries high vaccination rates like Israel, UK etc, top 20 near top 20 current infection rates. That’s kind whole point government. It’s goal maintain stable society.  I've virtual 8-9 years now. would never go back, unless 1-2 days/week office position. two major challenges I've found 1. need schedule time exercise, normal movement get working site cut out, 2. Making solid defining line work hours hours, easy think, ""I'll jump online minutes take care couple final things tomorrow."" Yep, one I’ve time two (my city one May 1, 2020 90 days ago put back place). want children trials. sure hell don’t want trial limited something isn’t called testing. Look J&amp;J vaccine. caused whole issue folks getting clots. happens children something like didn’t adequately test kids die, what’s answer? gonna say well works time?

I get want now, really need methodical. mean, good buddy mine embedded development home office several years now. Poor white people safety net? Bro, poor people screwed matter skin colors are.  true - I've generally found immediate circles least likely come around eventually explain things consistently fashion baseline, pointing time changing narrative. exasperating long journey.

There seems unlimited number unique edge cases wrt people make bad decisions, try generalize, frustrating none-the-less. Many bosses care power ego boost subordinates much team effectiveness. “*staff get together month team lunch…*” completely defeats purpose staying home quarantining other… might well go work actually plan that. argument vaccination caused new mutation become new dominant one, one dominants -- caused mutation itself, I've also tried explain, matter mutation came from. Oof. I’m sorry sounds brutal. 

My job pretty high concerns sending people home/ alternating shifts man, crushed productivity. solved parking problems, several department heads used highlight WFH May work many us. 

Good luck search! meant parody, thought established starting ""In perfect world"" That's OP said. want separate work environment home, space home office, need talk stuff people person teams calls person chats 


You might agree WFH work everyone. personally mind couple couple days per week depending accomplish. take online school first grade niece. love her, fun her, also *hell earth*. mom(who custody niece) works 10 hours day 3 hours commute total mostly support us three. schizophrenia bring 1/4 monthly income disability. several mental breakdowns throughout school year, feared I'd end back psych ward another month. 

We've realized can't online school year, roll dice delta person classes. Thankfully, everyone(me, mom, sister visits weekends) vaccinated, we're going first line approved 12.

I'm happy relieved get daytime free time back. I've several people reach message, they've always normal I've gone refer them. think people either think advice touch want put effort. mind downvotes, hope prevent people could helped taking advice seeing it. point, worst case ignored. last week great conversation someone actually longer position longer works company, still took time talk role gave great insights successful like work company/manager. People often willing help out, us little along careers often lot help along way. straight turned company phone view open line communication. don’t answer work calls outside work hours exceptions. check emails occasion, office side construction it’s idea I’m walking back week off.  take phone call client 4 minutes...what's complicated it?

Auto shop bills hour 194 bulb took 15 minutes.

TLDR: lawyers small vehicle repairs Still goes typical nature since value compassion hope, fields grow f*cks lie barren. I’ve never done can’t hurt try. Thank you! ones concerned middle management. They've always touted drivers workforce. Remote work even better productivity/efficiency shows full shit always been. still want everyone office bosses watch people work, 

The people make daily decisions, middle senior managers, exposed unproductive element within departments.  


This act self preservation one intent improving productivity. always meal prep anyways, spend money food WFM working office, except team would go lunch week 10 us.

Which also something really miss. Minorities poor safety net forced work sick cancelling those?????? someone works high school, thank this! wish students would get constantly disrupt school year quarantines. Dude...

I started exercise lunch time figure food shower (technically shower office mean man, thing), coffee great, sort weight(kettlebell) thrust time time, back pain! even read comics bed time time.

Result?

Productivity, motivation morale Bunch!

-""We need go office ... Ehrm, cross team eh connections?""

At office: still talks people shitty machine-coffer, avoid communicating open space annoys everyone (and getting annoyed/interrupted it).

/Rant :-D want get semantics here, overall point possible vaccines cause new dominant mutations/variants appear faster, rolling dice symptoms vaccines efficacy would dropping.

Doesn't article support idea?  Population density low outside cities also extra thousand deaths reported worst pandemic passed, also testing like 30k people day cities vaccinated better like 30 50 percent rural areas maybe 10 20 percent delta cities reaches villages going worse problem. team exponentially productive happier since remote work

Google “negativity bias.” Humans biologically drawn bad news adrenaline need prepared potential threats. 

Obviously Covid serious media would think 100% chance suffocating ICU vaccinated not, even data shows vaccinated people actually pretty freaking safe. 

Commercialized pessimism last thing need pandemic, it’s good time media let tell you. would really like know much feeds current vaccine hesitancy resistance. Although doubt possible measure full clarity, since fear needles may also increase receptivity vaccine misinformation.

In case helps anyone: like needles, Pfizer jab so, tiny easy. died export ban vaccines paid for


Canada vaccine production capacity result Canadian political choices. ""ban"" piece theatre show US government something. Manufacturers signed contract providing USA first refusal. Canada signed contracts knowing full well entirety US orders fulfilled could export. contracts drawn situation clear, one allusions facts where. political situation even clearer former presidents America first 24/7 mantra. 


AStrazeneca outlier situation large amounts exported EU fill finish. Arguably EU allowing J&amp;j exported US production ramped up. Astrazeneca failed submit emergency use authorization request hope continuing export doses EU make shortfall. kept saying ""soon"" unsurprisingly USA held onto supplies use. became clear later Astrazeneca plan submit required paperwork expiration dates neared. go waste mindless sloth.

Canada receiving contracted dosages well wastage issue. 



Finally United States suffered medication shortages supplies redirected vaccine production. way shield manufacturers invoking defense production act let breach contracts. UK signed brutally selfish vaccine contracts Astrazeneca. resulted EU leadership throwing fit, AZ production woefully behind schedule. 



Politico article shell game Astrazenecas vaccine production. Large amounts ""EU"" vaccine American bottled EU. Well want take, think alright kill animals food since evolved eat meat (though admit developed countries eat excess) 

However killing animals bred companions unnecessary cruelty. speaking someone finance field well may happen. Maybe affordable enough supply drop prices least. Thog says cavepeoples maths.

Just leave us want home, home. Currently reprogrammed Volgograd Orel. lease allows it.. Depends define mutation. mean mutation occurrence happens regularly? I've trying mean mutations start spread. mutations ""matter"".  Apparently, office buildings would take lot work turn housing mainly plumbing.

Oh. explains white relative told someone today die get covid vaccinated. Immune suppressant. Honestly... every TV show movie military deployed, support pandemic, generally signals shit hit fan. Sorry you’re downvoted genuinely smart question. Peak r/coronavirus here. still find strange several countries able reach practically negligible case levels restrictions terrible vaccine uptake, yet stubbornly high toughest restrictions Europe one vaccinated populations. No, unreasonable ask---just put position.  reason worries bosses bc many middle management exposed real purpose. hardest push return work coming people who's purpose 'watch over' people. fat old boomers charge blame gen X Z ""lazy"" ""entitled"" ""unloyal"" etc, company nothing help career progression training, want said we'd get, give us pay rises incentives stay get pay rise, way get pay rise days switch companies...but old boomers charge company see switching companies unloyal so...

Fucking old morons charge, seriously.  Basically, really effectiveness virus instead effectiveness compared unvaccinated control groups.

So vaccinated group gets infected 41% rate compared unvaccinated groups. Generally speaking, people inefficient 30 hour work week total productivity less despite worked hours 40. It’s linear. Yes. doesn’t speed mutation. You’re confusing lot things here. Yeah, already tried tech. There's reason vast majority tech jobs migrated India China.

I spent $600 four new tires vehicle March 2020. ~186,000 miles vehicle that. 

It's August 2021, vehicle little 187,000 miles. driving 50 miles week, minimum, April 2020. honestly got point worried sitting, made point putting fuel stabilizer tank driving around block least week. 

I've saved *ton* money driving. don’t think assuming 5 hours spent slacking off. you’re working may someone qualified would willing to.

Btw I’m similar situation really trying understand really way things going work revert back normal 40 per/week grind someone proves they’re willing put hours in. first shot 7/27, nearly 4 weeks ago. Ever since got first shot noticed strange stiffness weakness shoulder muscle injected. mobility isn’t limited, it’s kind weird weak feeling, thumb hand shakes like crazy start curl it. occurring got shot started initial arm soreness died first shot. also noticed pale red spot size drink coaster subsided days ago. 

The thing found googling “Covid arm” don’t fit symptoms lasted quite long time first shot. input others around here? possible hit kind nerve ending? worth contacting doctor goes much longer? still plan getting second shot Tuesday scheduled.  Sad hear v Manager here, team work fine home. want back happier...but we're forced back senior level management ha idea actually do..... Husband's company made everyone come back work soon CDC said masking okay vaccinated. reversed course even though Southeast mobile morgue trucks called in. science based company...there workforce leaving pre covid sure everyone looking another job moment. halted last one overwhelming hospitals again? Shutting down? 
Shame we've already taken table. Oh well. You’re confusing correlation causation. 

Yes, escapes immunity. vaccines aren’t making worse. virtue reducing spread make BETTER. frustrating thing could get pretty far with:

- Mandatory vax staff
- Mandatory masks all
- Open windows
- Cheap, portable HEPA filters (e.g. Blueair)
- pooled testing
- Lunch outside, possible, weather permitting.

None things even border difficult expensive. many places trying them. Didnt plan involving wall south? got location wrong. job basically alone there's real benefit office people. collaborative jobs benefit working home since sometimes easier get input visualize things person. reason mention I'm talking vaccinated population. I'm saying delta could spread within unvaccinated population rate greater covid classic spread last year, resulting hospitalizations last year (entirely unvaccinated). reasoning behind delta spreads quickly, means lot sick unvaccinated people once.

Mine that. downsized huge savings. idea new office I’ll ever set foot (could find address needed it) buddy’s company closed office completely lease ended last year, everything storage revaluation covid over.  young population, iirc 5%  Sublet then. it’s working now,why go back? what?🤣 part study still antibodies roof (she healtcare fully vaccinated January). really vary person course will, changed nothing prevent going direction. know many are, especially see exponential case growth within schools. tipping point, one identify feels like we're going go we're passed point unnecessary mass infections.

Sounds like got deserved endangering public.
Newsflash break law held accountable Israeli study, think discount people get COVID.

Thanks support, lot reading topic, I'm safe school. kids' school that's issue, they're fully vaccinated, 18 months enough house.

I'm choosing safe worrying. going help. lol. getting ridiculous… terrifying.. Yep, same. frustrating. Yes, vaccinated people transmit virus. they're infected, much less likely unvaccinated person. they're infected transmit virus much shorter period time unvaccinated person infected. Overall transmission vaccinated people-- that's far cry ""vaccine stopping viral shedding whatsoever."" 

Anti-vax sites take small piece truth expand big lie. Hey, I've never heard horses dying COVID-19, so... ^/s would hold American jail quick napkin math, worst-case scenario ~half population getting infected 1% succumbing, comes 5 7 million dead. 

Very rough math admittedly horrible side range, says accurate account worldwide covid-19 deaths likely years making pandemic actually subsides, ever. top everything else, fully expect many countries flatout lie answer all.  I'm ""ad hominem"" attacking - I'm telling go away. quite obsessive. census happened, they'll keep electoral votes another 9 years even entirety Villages becomes post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland.  Absence evidence evidence absence. Also, Delta+vaccine around long enough places significant enough spread meaningfully measure long covid. Maybe Israel data -- I'd like see so.

In US, tracking mild breakthroughs all. 

The UK data long covid, including one two studies I've seen long covid rates vaxxed (with limitations, see page 10): study Israeli study nurses, Alpha, showing vaccine basically lower rates long covid (study also limitations).

Can show data countries tracking mild breakthrough cases? ok take pain relief day second dose? Got killer headache hours anti-vaxxers believe scientific research believe anecdotal medication advice Linda street. cumulative? issue, maybe daily, seven week average vaccinated vs unvaccinated hospitalization. 

I truly think vaccines keeping deaths LA need data [It's occurring 10-30% reported five days ago  believe actually promising studies ongoing effects covid.

Here one June last year.
 believe correct term ""assholes"" mean, getting booster, probably around October make last winter look Worldometers everyday. Florida say there's 20,000+ new cases zero deaths. Today said 11 deaths. There's way accurate. True, may picked covid hospital treated bronchitis there. Many people picked covid hospitals throughout pandemic. Also, fact nobody else family tested positive covid throughout illness makes seem like truly bronchitis. story mention test took antigen test quite bit false negatives although rare somebody symptomatic covid test negative three consecutive times. 😱😱😱😱😱 means largely functional normal life, even may 'new' normal. I'm quarantined due lack information confidence probability long covid low given current technology. consider normal. Malaria Africa part status quo, status quo vaccine effective treatments there.

Endemic covid means back new normal fits standards first world country. Combine low rate transmission, vaccine efficiacy, potentially antibody therapy efficiacy preventing long covid, render probability getting long covid similar getting permanent injury car crash call covid societal phase over.  Ideally would require bit complex tbh. It’s also used anti worm medication humans, human version hard find people taking animals ones. people even started taking first place, one medications people started experimenting beginning pandemic anecdotal evidence helping started spreading trough word mouth plus studies later disproved think. seems like even human version currently doesn’t work, appeared might point guess people started pushing caught anti-vaxx crowd. look incoming studies long covid vax: aware two. One Israeli study mention, hardly comforting, indicating vaccine really help reduce long covid rates (from 10-30% often see quoted).

The study seen shows vaccine reduces long covid chances half (with limitations, see page 10): getting data ""certainly far fewer unvaccinated""? think optimistic based current evidence (not anecdote).

I feel teacher mom. study came today analyzed measures worked best preventing transmission classroom -- send want.  Next: flea collar Thank you! That's informative. may special case types hospitals (one state \[mental\] hospital, instance). risk covid.Be done &amp; rush hospitals longer breathe choice risk death it. Stay safe! apparently, younger people better lasting immunity curiosity, get vaccine? lived life like qas pre-pandemic, know exactly why. do. vaccination rate increasing rapidly. doctor, see someone laying ground clearly need help, training instincts kick in. would immediately compassionately make sign saying lay floor. 
Pro tip: use caps underline emphasis Ontario, Canada, publishes cases, hospitalizations, ICU occupancy vaccination status. 

Currently, vaccinated people 85-88% less likely test positive. go r/Ontario daily report really detailed stats. know several people similar symptoms. tested negative. Similar story ongoing 6+ months. Visited Dr's many times since then. can't figure out. Scary    Insurance companies care maximum profit. place directly doctors people. logic. dumb, considering brain fog career ender. I'd call severe.  Vaccines made primarily prop work force. another version world, vaccines could made save lives reduce suffering, reality. Governments vaccinating populations don't, economies deflate dramatically.

Anyway, point decided US vaccinate world, still motivated money. thread full people conveniently forgot badly data lagged reality last year. Affordable Care Act always actual name. Obamacare detractors called make sound worse voters. one wearing one, KN95, kitchen 8-10 people?  Contract manufacture mean start. contract Pfizer (far late turning first offer) still takes months doses made, delivered, scheduled appointments, given people. Yeah, 17 month old son totally option get vaccine. Thanks misinformation. There's 200k troops wanting vaccine. Unlike hundreds Anthrax, afford lose many people. 

The US military would longer operationally capable. incredibly bad take. Lots us family friends old young enough risk, many older ones, group risk without vaccination, got vaccines January may longer protection need.

I'd like move life. means seeing 2 year old niece, Thanksgiving grandparents. can't safely right now. lol people stupid Mr hands horse actually Help make make sense. take vaccine know what's trust government health experts, doctors, scientists. take random doses large animal drugs trust TV talking heads, radio hosts bloggers. sense, pure contrariness. stayed alone, cobtact others, go hospitals get covid, one would problem. since part society, oart societal agreement kill others expose harm. r/nottheonion still think fastest way drop case counts US joke part, right? They’re hesitant take actual vaccine, they’re okay this? cannot comprehend Moonshine, there's cure!  Pharmacist here, vaccinated drawn thousands. 2500 vaccines deep freezer set expire end month. Pfizer magically says going extend shelf life (this never happens), simultaneously CDC says it’s booster time ! Retracts it, says yes, says let poor people go first rich folk get third. 

I feel like goal posts moving fast, almost seems like nobody knows talking about. 

I want freaking titer get booster. vaccine isn’t 100% safe (nothing is). comes want data make decision. smoking analogy helpful incorrect. fired blatant disregard rules, risk put students at, would negligible. 
We mostly agree good rule... gotta wait 30 years eventually may mostly agree good rules covid  trying say capacity online October whatever sufficient meet worldwide demand? 24% people worldwide fully vaccinated, less 2% fully vaccinated low income countries. surprise. Literally everyone stopped wearing facemasks.

Shops high street malls still signs retail workers wearing masks people breeze without masks without reproach. Nobody says anything.   Areas high case counts sending patients hundreds miles away available beds. It’s like hospitals take patients within state borders. Fairly soon way things trending, won’t extra beds available state—no matter high local vaccination rate is. Anti-vaxxers blame this. Getting triggered even less useful.  fellow Kansas Citian wild! difference vaccination interval doses also seems critical factor delta surge affected countries (Israel UK). live US West Coast family planning 3 week trip East Coast summer 2022.

My traveling party fully vaccinated willing get booster shot approved necessary. also wearing masks social distancing much possible see COVID spread minimal. However visiting higher-risk tourist places like New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, Orlando Disney World Resort.

I questions:
- think safe start planning booking trip yet? don’t want sink time, money, excitement planning something go drain like 2020 travel plans due COVID. plan book, better 95% sure it’s actually going happen, hate getting super excited trip put time planning let COVID, anything really.
- think even enjoy trip? mean pretty comfortable going local places right (with vaccine, distancing, masking eating/drinking, dining outdoors, sanitation, etc.) pretty comfortable going theme parks, stores, malls, restaurants, arcades, outdoor sports games, movie theaters, etc. local area, want know COVID restrictions summer 2022 make hard enjoy trip (haven’t traveled since summer 2019 don’t really experience that).
- Florida bad summer 2022? Disney World part trip highlight us, never there. huge Disney Parks fan (been Disneyland CA dozens times), one part really looking forward to, anything else, concerned safe/being guilt-tripped going COVID breeding ground missing one thing really wanted do. case counts bad now, think calm then. Exactly. Leave maybe they’ll covid next weeks get shot execution style dying immediately? I’m thinking- get we’ll treat/isolate positive cases. Goal best outcome people. Getting killed insurgents doesn’t meet goal. Alternate link require know home town would things like deep clean assisted living home hospice attached hospital. Yeah, Midland purgatory even without deadly pandemic. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ question mandate everyone gets vaccine get creative. 

Want license renewed? Gonna need vaccinated. 

Want permit city hall? Gonna need vaccinated. 

Want file taxes? Gonna need vaccinated.

Want get buy gun? Gonna need vaccinated. Can, would incorrect, literally zero reason to.

It's funny people thread feel strongly using incorrect abreviation stopped officially use since 1980s. dare bring facts emotional battle?! Agreed. It’s good see we’re making progress, though. We’re definitely better position entering last fall vaccines, it’s likely going peaks valleys foreseeable future. Beer actually tastes much better since getting sick, although might side effect living pandemic lol. haven’t personally smell/taste issues reappearing sick, got sick December tested negative twice. Whatever cleared within like day two intense. 

I still can’t smell farts bodily functions don’t smell right. That’s far loss scent goes now. Stones roll, that's God's plan. called Book Satan.  Actually, false. Obese folks (and think smokers?) overally die sooner, integrating lifetime insured individual, insurance companies pay ut less money overall

One reason insignificant chunk healthcare spending prolonging life older folks situations (at least healthcare team) trouble letting go. CPR 45 minutes 80+ year old folks? usually end ICU days weeks there's 5-10% survival rate, usually neuro deficits.

I've worked countries, Docs afraid say ""well, gave good shot grannie's time"" reasonable effort. keep going everyone exhausted THOUSANDS dollars spent (wasted?).

If American Medical machine stopped treating death ""failure system"", focused quality life, cost would go down.

Ask physician wishes CPR, Intubation, etc. doctors want it, want die peacefully. Show me.

Oh....you've run off. Oh yeah, I’m saying it’s there, hope take 3 steps forward one one step back (no restrictions businesses, people see family without fear huge outbreak, masks may needed foreseeable future). We’re progressing toward normality, going peaks valleys next 6 months. correct. They're already flying military bases domestic, would much easier set quarantine two weeks. Use time prepare entering nation ex-pats well. You’re one asserted know mask wearing area better do. 

Anyway good night. read study. Please someone correct I’m wrong bht doesn’t show masks work preventing spread . (It doesn’t show don’t work- wasn’t really testing masks work like headline indicates.)

What shows universal masking results fewer self reported high risk exposures. Meaning, universal masking healthcare workers felt exposed less often. doesn’t provide data shows translates lower infection rates. French fries don’t taste like farts anymore I’ve switch wheat beers lagers. noticed it’s gradually getting better. 

I got really sick weeks ago honestly thought COVID 102° fever week. turned something bacterial guess Z pack cleared right up. Whatever scrambled smell taste wonder going happen every time get sick. Blazer games end regular season/first round playoffs, lines usual. extra stop line show vaccine card/photo vaccine card, results day-of COVID-19 screening questionnaire Blazers app. There's another checkpoint scanning tickets, finally security screening/metal detector checkpoint. security screening checkpoint always rate-limiting step, lines always. get stronger antibody protection shot Covid. wish federal government would say aid dependent mask mandate. covid? percent holds up, 22 unvaccinated. joke. never lifted mandates first place. everyone fucking impatient would shit already. Uhhh…no. hope turning endemic there. COVID zero anymore. 

We’ve right wrong pandemic, may want go high horse, dude. American Catholics pathetically politicized fallen victim misinformation campaigns. 

I friend (very devout practicing catholic) posted Church denying religious exemptions simple message, “get vaccinated, it’s Jesus would done” people losing damn minds comments untested vaccines aborted fetus ingredients, “my body, choice” (*really* wish saw irony one), etc.  I'm getting infected COVID safety trials complete COVID virus itself. Checkmate. Hopefully soon. Moderna started human trials mrna HIV vaccine. can’t even vaccinate country. you. Breakthrough cases celebrities would often reported individually non-celebs see percentage number representing everyone. 

I much doubt breakthrough percentage somehow higher among well known people. you. “*More* bodies usual” floating Ganges.  math correct, that's 3.4 cases per hospital 1/3 fully partially vaccinated. Fair enough. past year half sympathize that. So, vaccines work? I'm confused. year, flu vaccine consists 4 strains thought going prominent. Source? cause guess you’ve **every part country?**

Sounds like referring everywhere. sure helps assertion tho. Yes I’m really concerned vaccine efficacy waning faster 8 months. think second dose Feb (so good October). Worried elderly front line medical workers we’re vaccinated early.  Didn’t make statement everywhere. live. three months right away? He's also lockdown we're point live it. chiropractor

Well go school district around going require masks, made clear would open huge lawsuits (not if) summer kids get really sick. Ain't sad still studies masks working year half already  get another state, plenty people due moving, etc. sure bring vaccination card appointment! downvote getting you. brings 0 nothing imaginary internet points. let getting voted. look like taking lol. See can't give up. Texas transfer people [as far might part Idaho sending people way. many places south running room hospitals, surprising places taking overflow filling too.

I’m really frustrated too. get bad news (or neutral news spun look bad) gets clicks sells papers, gives ammunition side thinks none big deal shots don’t work. many people safe healthy *because* vaccines, even get sick. same. thought too. originally talking booster shots going make new vaccines variants like flu shots. advice appears take third dose vaccine. hope school districts hold out. either bluffing pulling funding concerned maintaining authoritarian power instead actually educating children. That’s meant, thank you. answer 400% Wow hell. Florida similar population country, Chile, right averaging around 280 deaths per week... least last week. 1200 weekly deaths would entire country lockdown. can't even imagine.

Also 70% population fully vaccinated, florida 50%. mainly used Sinovac either:

-Sinovac better expected 

Or

-The delta variant SERIOUSLY lethal (we allegedly delta yet) dad fence (he isn’t generally anti-vaxxer odd part- gets flu shot every year, shingles vaccine, etc) finally got one one doses 2 months ago. ended getting COVID, fact got shot reason felt like shit week good go.

The doctor nurse told much too, helps. laws need understand still get sick shot, you’ll probably totally fine weeks. It’s frustrating people don’t understand (vaccinated people) aren’t reason it’s spreading much. point American government going realise covid infinity long term solution. We're getting close two years pandemic still America seeing massive waves infection, deaths overloaded hospitals vets. Sure are.  No, Sinopharm COVID vaccine actually performing worse Western vaccines. necessarily. Risk factor classifications follow nice round numbers.

I one question, hope could answer it, point debate community time.

With every new variant, see changes spike protein. time changes enough starts circumvent antibodies produced vaccine targets protein, leading decreased effectiveness.

Theoretically, decision use whole virus vaccine help Sinopharm fight variants? parts virus, get smaller changes mutating, could mean antibodies would easier time fighting different strains? contrast vaccines target exclusively spike protein. Gonna get wormy horse. don’t see much difference anti vaxer person virtue signalling tell whole world they’re fully vaxed. dating apps first photo mask, vaccine bandaid stupid ass sticker saying you’re vaxed, I’m likely hard passing would nut job going conspiracy rant covid fake. 

Just go get vaxed, really need advertised? Lambda variant already exists nearly concerning Delta. parents retired getting vaccinated said us kids “if get covid please don’t worry, I’m missing time y’all already have”. aren’t dumb don’t pitch fits wear mask anymore, went 3 separate short beach trips may last week. Using wrong there/they're/their using excuse typing informally message board really going work they're roughly number letters difficulty type. hard use right one? makes look stupid use wrong one, least me. conspiracy goal post move deep state state forced never trust vaccine.

I'm asking starting put delta vaccine production. hella pro-vaccine point want one that's directed whatever biggest variant time, whole point mRNA platform.   Romanians vaccine hesitant? Instascammer going big payout I'm betting.   Yeah, don’t want people know cure is…

/S sort lost Tuskegee comparison, situation government complicit making things worse actually conspiracy prevented people getting right treatment.

I would say Federal government rolling back mask mandates ""to incentivize getting vaccinated"" constitutes complicit. Let's add refusing RealID compliant vaccine credential. Thanks I'll check out. Per post history, getting vaccine month lot medical issues. treatment. Offered? mandatory inbound travelers. mean, it’s like rest state super careful either. don’t understand. big thing first came preventing collapse hospitals limited here. it’s happening one seems care. like anti-test demos test also gets covid-pass.

There's nothing ""not fair"" expecting humans put stopping worldwide humanitarian disaster ahead slightly reducing mortality country booster shots. vaccines work well post-exposure, rabies example. unlike dog bite, Covid exposure silent.

There vaccines known help develop symptoms. heard prophylaxis, something use late covid stages. What's understanding IGG antibody levels? 


Would say higher levels IGG = protection / less likely get super sick?

Just commenting seem know talking about... Instead FDA getting involved this, FCC needs get involved yank Fox News broadcast license. live Ontario, Canada reports daily. case that’d help give uou comfort. 

I family US saying likely get hospitalized vaccinated anecdotal evidence. CDC actually published data would way counter that. title Fear Mongering little, find useful info ways article though.

""All said, facts well established point. Vaccinated people infected virus much less likely need go hospital, much less likely need intubation much less likely die illness. There’s doubt vaccines provide significant protection. large proportion nation -- almost 30% U.S. adults -- vaccinated, fact conspired highly contagious delta variant push country new wave outbreaks."" best way stop before.

-it's longitudinal study, rather cross-sectional study, factual basis draw casual link;

-they premorbid IQ data tried estimate basing general gender/socioeconomic factors model gives correlation something like 0.5 (so particularly strong);

-not sample random, likelihood catching covid also random across socioeconomic groups, something authors seem adress;

-the authors acknowledge non-covid respiratory viruses (including flu) also cause cognitive deficits;

-obviously, study conducted 2020, role vaccines could investigated.

For understand, *can* say study ""people covid scored lower intelligence test"". There's really much basis draw claims like ""covid causes cognitive deficits"" (although, again, similar viruses surprising). Same. known 1 person, coworker traveled Mexico got delta. That’s it.

The reason pretty simple people team spouse kids take time work day every single day since people stuck home rest time spouse kids one talk hobbies many team's internal meetings turn hobby chats end. Yes, people chatted non-work stuff office, way different. walk across office chat cars 1-2 hours people notice, easily call.

Why would businesses want huge buildings, huge overheads everyone work well kitchen table.? Agree, big suits still hate idea. 

I've got global team. meetings already telecoms videos. cares comes house? staff easily productive homes. I. instead hour away something happened home, could handle instantly. 

I'm trying squeeze flexibility powers be, demand person. We're going lose good staff this. Canada. said ""better"". mean say masks protect wearer all.  mother law works Florida day care many coworkers werent vaccinated stopped wearing masks CDC said vaccinated people could stop wearing masks. 11 people got covid job, lots babies well. think couple unvaccinated coworkers ended hospital one two babies ICU too. mother law fully vaccinated still lost sense smell, got back, weeks still barely smell without putting something close nose faint. know mild case, losing sense smell still really sucks,.. one reasons still cautious even though I'm fully vaccinated. Australian mainland states except conservative-led New South Wales defeated delta outbreaks locking hard fast like New Zealand (NZ might even harder). there's bunch spread find case triggers lockdown, next step rapid contact tracing finding virus chance move around. like everyone's done covid sees Delta non existent. know better.  Sympotmatic cariers virus higher chance passing virus others

Maybe. showed evidence doubt it. doubt symptomatic carriers likely home, sick. Whereas asymptomatic carriers - PRODUCE MUCH VIRAL LOAD WHETHER VACCINATED - likely outside, going work. 

The point same. vaccine really protect people. lead end epidemic own; without masking eventual herd immunity. people need vaccinate otherwise healthcare system collapse. USA, 25% unvaccinated still much hospitals. I'm proposing message tell anti-vaxxers. fuck taking this? can’t see vaccinated people taking it, they’re vaccinated. love irony it’s ANTIVA taking somehow trust what’s horse dewormer what’s vaccine? early say. Australian mainland states except conservative-led New South Wales defeated delta outbreaks locking hard fast like New Zealand (NZ might even harder). there's bunch spread find case triggers lockdown, next step rapid contact tracing finding virus chance move around. Right that's still multiple ongoing studies combat covid...why people getting arms possibly second way combatting covid lol. specifically said ""prevent infection.""

Until good studies suggesting current vaccines basically eliminate risk debilitating long covid (we data, all), want prevent infection... Thank &lt;3 Jfc. could parents even know cut called reptilian.  not.

These four million doses worth happened much earlier vaccination cycle wherein Biden admin worried optics straight donations. 

 [The actual donation landmarks straight mean, post straight borderline misinformation. said Us mostly loaned vaccines 110+ million US given use four million example. really bad faith, dude. like going office, yeah. Lots bullshit time wasting happens there, particularly middle management. Victoria beat several times, NSW time. still might recover. think it’s kind sad someone’s entire life/social life work environment. people aren’t staying job forever you’re relying company people sticking around happy? Get hobby, there’s life working work. seen much drama go emails!  still approved clinical trials ongoing then? get everyone get upset possible SECOND solution combatting covid. someone dealt outsourcing, unlikely. moment need collaboration, need people schedule you.

If something useful contribute, please do. Otherwise, upvote downvote move on. think 1-3 days moderate sickness comparable flu ever real flu. Influenza kills around 290,000 650,000 every year according [1].

[1]  we’re going pretend overhead baked price? Seattle area, 25% cases, 12% hospitalizations 13% deaths vaccinated 6/21 7/22. It’s pretty likely vaccinated area especially older adults.

The median age breakthrough deaths ~83. know beaten per se....but SEEM be...hopefully haha SD County says vaccination rate among 60s 91%, among 70s 98%, among 80+ 84%. would dunno. part confusing you? seems pretty clear advocacy three-shot approach view, hence, personally.

As opposed repeating someone else's view. *shocked Pikachu* Same. metrics show teams productivity it’s stayed up. personally desk much went in. Hour commute gone, home gym now, don’t need leave eat get moment myself. 

It’s actually exacerbated personal work addiction issues. wedding. Boosters authorized everyone end September, immunocompromised. nothing Pfizer trying make money. That's bullshit conspiracy feed antivaxx narratives. people even know Provincetown outbreak!! Like perfectly intelligent people still think basically over, least vaccinated people. :( keep seeing news 'vaccinated cards required' etc, feel like even though thats good thing, still giving people false sense reassurance Isolate give special treatment like developmentally disabled kids? I'd it, think get pushback idea. natural immunity Covid strong long vaccine. 

Saying deserve priority someone got vaccine try avoid getting disease ""putting camp"" Manager here- completely happy everyone wfh. It’s top guys don’t want it. unpaid, pay commute. I'm saving $60 week public transport (based current WFH 4 days week) made buying nice big monitor home lot easier. yes, noted, get back 10-12 hours week time. means eat better time cook, exercise more, run errands work instead commuting, weekends spent relaxing hanging friends family instead errands. company keeps talking mental health wellness. Well, go. job lost someone another department, moved someone team replace person, increased work, WFH. honestly, even mind one bit lol. joyful, invigorating feeling every day wake up, knowing deal traffic, rush hour, long lines drive-thru, irritating co-workers, smelling people's shit use bathroom, stepping people's piss (I'm janitor btw, I'm video editor, people really bad bathroom etiquette worked)... listen one guy type really loudly everyone see holding several different conversations friends Facebook Messenger, one guy laughing youtube videos day, one guy snoring he's fallen asleep desk 100th time, strong stench worst smelling cigars CEO whatever f\*ck wants to.... honestly list keep going.  make significantly difficult managers take credit employee’s productivity. ever shall do? Lol. work hours, team doesn't. expected work 40. never really minded working home. I’m making assumptions, COVID everywhere US believe not, kids simply aren’t dying, yes get sick horrible it’s extremely rare child die COVID without serious underlying health conditions. pasa nada! NZ returning back low single digits likely fantasy point. Singapore faced issue month ago via new cluster they're still seeing mid double digit cases daily. going even harder NZ Singapore still seeing numbers despite much higher vaccination rate. Correct. two possibilities (both probably true):

 - longer interval conveys greater protection
 - protection wanes time since got second doses months ago, protection time wane compared people USA. smart person trusts corporations far throw youre going lure young people seen multiple 'once lifetime' financial crises promising future money. know likely wont youre selling bill goods.

What good pension going 2065 even money survives paid out? paying attention rapidly deteriorating situation around you? People arent going work corporate promises future compensation. figure I'm probably getting covid. I'm vaccinated school's starting days go party school everyone guess itching party cause restrictions like last year, also live two people. indoor mask mandate however many people sitting next eachother class mask gonna help much, assume. hope get long covid. Exactly this. really wish data interpreted information shared complete transparency, without consider affect thinking idiots. Sympotmatic cariers virus higher chance passing virus others asymptomatic people symptomatic disease matters point cause talking slowing spread. 

So less people get symptomatic less people transmit virus people get symptomatic. passed away today... OK. percentage viral infections stopped cold vaccine. percentage not, much likley asymptomatic. people asymptomatic still walking around spreading virus to, average, 5 people. Correct? can’t afford fee, find cheaper lawyer Thank also value judgment. hope made feel better today. I'm even sure numbers accurate. Everyone seeing weeks ago getting shot forgieners vaccine vacation. I'm okay home far. I'm one worried every strange thing comes high BP issue, vaccinated I'm hoping helped. took covaxin inactivated vaccine India. wish still working home full time. Gotta commute office week. Many hours/week sitting traffic could still sleeping stuff around house.

I welcome death office life remote work possible. Nope. go way use insane mental gymnastics taken propaganda. chose get vaccinated, therefore chose outcome acceptable risk. one person country realistically say don’t think Covid real kills people. think trump would want do. mean bodies choice right? niece's school cases entire country... fucking end me. whole team pretty miserable misses office 🤷  treated like they’re North Korea don’t want experimented on? covid. don’t want need vaccine. explain exactly deserve end camp? 15 seconds? milliseconds? see 1 second latency satellite internet renders interactive applications painful use, kind useless really. Lunar latency like 2.5-3 seconds.

To point touch tech leadership, similar conversation latency tied speed light told they’d “escalating vendor”. Mate, can’t escalate speed light. Oof. Might work others, much noise activity me.   PA starting back school next weeks, much worry what’s going happen. Especially since employer pushing hard us go back work lot ppl work kids school, dumb. directors WFH prior pandemic thankfully. allowed myself, manager, reports move away. mortgage company needed letter saying wouldn’t lost job moved. That's good point well. think whole children gets covid stuff gets conflated lot points debate.
1. Danger children
2. Resources taken

I mean fact many unvaccinated adults ICU kinda tells us need another vector, aka children. also fair, amount children, percentage-wise still low. regards resources taken, still low kind reactionary right regards children context.

The death rate low, think concerning thing long term effects. Biological social. Home schooling already tough kids viable. brain fog trouble learning makes worse. data results this, see badly fucked part Gen Z. +100 summed value nicely (for actually good managers) know 5 deaths people pulling parking lot receiving vaccines? Really makes wonder they're putting shots cause 3,000lb car magnetically pulled towards other. feel like lot best employees position amazing job wanting stay put. enjoy job do, stressful make enough money happy. people companies focus keeping happy since glue holds things together.

Its actually sad many people get promoted completely clueless. manager nicest guy, great people person accommodating requests he's complete pushover bad managing teams tasks. basically lead employees taking advantage others end work cleaning messes bad employees. Yeah also like going office. go days. boss starts complaining people WFH, assuming agree him... YIKES.

Actually like going office less crowded... need inhuman logic know answer that. happens case we're bit pickle Delta, needs high antibody titers prevent infection, compared Alpha strains. case, probably discussing boosters immediate future.

you need high antibody titers protect body. think medical community media misunderstand immune system works. like large amount antibodies diseases general, like mentioned half life days. immune system complex (duh, lol) like said antibody one offers long term protection memory b cells. act early warning systems see foreign body say, oh, s\*\*t, someone trying get sound alarm. body goes overdrive starts produce antibodies. virus ""target back"" killer cells attack. like soldier paints target laser cruise missile gets lock. information European unions version cdc well likely - 1 false positive rapid antigen test, 2 false negative PCR tests? 

Someone close contact took at-home rapid antigen covid test positive. took PCR test day came back negative. next day, took another PCR test also came back negative. 

I can’t find straight answer online interpret this, seems pretty rare situation. know antigen tests less accurate PCR; said, false negatives common false positives. I’m hard time determining test likely wrong. I'm sorry things hard right now. hope people wise soon, though I'm optimistic.  Oh, wait... testing R95 ability filter respiratory droplets using olive oil simulate. representative tests though. I'm confused. sounds like stupidest PETA propaganda.

There ZERO PROOF single animal shot... kind Channel 9 lazy journalism euthanise dogs shooting them?

no **Dog shelter denies shooting dogs !!!**

I read entire article, came away precious little truth... by-laws common practices... truth. people vaccinated, end hospital. People often say masks interfere life, true. club meetings went back online, office pushed back reopening generally friends vaccinated less willing go out. 

If want wear one telling stop. also think it’s huge assumption believe children aren’t vulnerable simply aren’t dying rate 80yos. transmissible COVID becomes, sick kids we’ll see likely case studies like ones pop up. don’t disagree.

I suspect end day they’ll lobby make employees kind hybrid 1099’s still schedule tipped workers pay responsible unemployment. Wait staff purely paid tips. That’s prediction things headed.

Might sound crazy, look loopholes they’ve already carved out. It’s insane. special minimum wage hasn’t updated roughly 30 years. open another kind business next door pay full wage pay taxes full wage. need proper scientific polling data anecdotal personal data. Welcome hell, half doctors accuse lying/say head, half say ""huh, sucks, nothing do"". finally changed mind? “After remote working proved huge success without drop productivity, bosses worried employees may want upset new found work / life balance…”  interesting fall break half Midwest descends Florida. Shit’s going implode. Again. Gotta suck raking money garbage conspiracy stuff. look Zuck's concern pic above! 


I used actually miss Facebook ditched it, every month goes feel better giving asshole company another cent (well, far help least). Facebook human version Krell mind machine, monsters Id. This. managers job ensure assigning work team members aligns strengths, enough doesn’t help develop weaker skills, remove barriers come teams. office versus remote requires different tools principles good managers adapt. pretty senior guy company worry new people. lot people barely know we’re hired sometime past 18 mos.  80 people office used know everyone name. 

Overall best year ever last year next year going amazing well. 

I find certain people find way disappear, majority super productive. person issues complicates things though, especially young kids home. think that's entirely true. tons really intelligent, hardworking, honest workers India. problem guys realize value charge accordingly want hire them, paying maybe 60%* wage American. That's good enough wannabe outsourcers, want pay 10% American wage. scrape bottom barrel like that, unsurprisingly get bottom barrel quality workers. 
 
\* take exact numbers gospel, pulled ass THIS! Office drama. becomes clear really issue come drama. “Unconscionable” extraordinarily inflammatory way characterize situation. might handled things sub-optimally, call unconscionable shows complete trivialization complexity situation.

It's diagnosis exclusion, doctor need rule everything else first, takes fair amount time confirm quality life absolute shit mental state crashing since losing job.

Yeah, I'm similar boat, many condition. worst quality life far condition. I'd better schizophrenic colon cancer.

Sources one: grok figure last one shows I'm talking  Companies managers obsessed getting people back even part time focused wrong priorities. seems strong, deep rooted issues trusting employees. feel bad countless restaurants won’t survive without lunch time crowd, won’t able stay business. clog lines poison control ironically getting advice professional know hate that. I’m you. way many distractions home, lack separation home work really grinds down. easily much less productive home spending tons time Zoom depressing me.

I fine hybrid model one can’t wait go back employer won’t allow yet. mass links, prove wrong, need show data confirms vaccine slows spread transmissibility (r) virus (not hospitalizations) Man, \*did\* completely fall popular discourse? gone. Completely gone.  This! wife’s CEO said got depressed WFH mandated everyone back work. None supervisors agree her. that’s hot mess. Regional surges can’t last forever. know much time, effort, money, law development try reduce car gun deaths country? decades longer? don’t notice you’re used it. Remove restrictions place driving, road construction, automobile manufacturing see happens.

200 years ago people used losing 45% kids death age five. I’d rather take steps direction, whether means kids dying covid kids dying covid - hospital care need anything car accidents cancer unavailable hospitals full covid work consultants eat lot hours keep within target fees project engagement letter. Especially lower level consultants. sometimes feel like we're game, multiple viruses running once. company ordered everyone back office September despite rising numbers Delta infections. managers unhappy, manager unhappy, say matter.

There's way I'm going productive worked home. Even *wanted* work hard, there's way I'm capable good job much worse experience working office (to say nothing needlessly endangering lives). Lol first day school whole class 4 year olds exposed school person tested positive student next quarantine. feel exactly way. Even office that’s ghost town, three days office voluntarily, felt new strange feeling…of engaged work. I’d literally forgotten feeling year exclusively WFH. WFH hit wall 2 pm every day headaches brain fog. TBH disability home, difference stark. We’re exactly that. Consolidating making hoteling spaces. Thank you, saved type that. safe sorry

Be careful line thinking. You’re mistake comparing potential side effects vaccine normal healthy life rather comparing potential risk *catching covid*. I'm currently looking work positions interviewing fully remote default. people like current companies rules, plenty others willing work get that, people see everyone getting vaccine? think there's ""save brown people"" cooler vaccines use?  mention people stations got shot black, they'd it! :)

Pretty much conspiracy garbage point. People going people, many die completely un-factual beliefs. ones feel empathy ones spreading conspiracies, that's actively harming others.  productivity company dramatically improved due remote work.

Perhaps they're worried performance management blame technology? pension good benefits, poor pay. equals same, college graduate care less $10 co-pays hospital 85% pension 60 years (100% 64). safe guys think indoor stadium concerts mandatory vaccine/or negative covid test + masks are? tickets foo fighters Saturday forum LA I’m 80% wanting go, really really would like go Yes, point people *don't* survive vaccine (if given soon enough), rather people *do* survive.

Of course, must given symptoms. It’s amazing realize many old peoples social lives office. ones want typically least productive. get prefer person meetings topics outside bullshitting break room waste time now. Companies sense jumping chance downsize office footprints costs.
 
And downsizing works wonders urban congestion. tell that. Yeah, job security thing stressful. stressful.

I work collaborative industry person onsite meetings time anyways inspections. Scheduling meetings ended eating lot people times impromptu meetings whiteboard 5 minutes.

Sure, production little difference wfh office get old paper documents need revising large home office table. thinking that, might good option. Maybe go back rest cities 2023 something.

We want make multi-destination trip though since wouldn’t traveled 3 years point, even short road trip camping (not *outdoorsy* vacationers first place).

I know Disney World last stop, even pandemic, since would tiring part vacation would probably want go home rest go somewhere else afterwards. pandemic also helps minimizing chance spreading virus multiple cities states, since right going place likely catch COVID, worry spreading home different cities states.  even driver's licences... Maybe ""old boy network"" type effect play: managers drag asses work want tradition challenge keep going on. Otherwise workers seen wimpy slackers want easy way out. governor’s office state partners working together reestablishing enforcement system. details coming days.""

""Better nothing"" reckless approach comes life death situations. put lap belts vehicles anymore reason. wait, PR, getting people vaccinated? outbreaks announced vaccine available? 

I genuinely understand story believe right now. Like, many cases think China June 2020, Aug 2020, Dec 2020, April 2021, June 2021, Aug 2021 many cases think China announced? What's relationship two. Zero cases Christchurch? One case reported Wellington. No, doesn't. real world scenario well happen. zero peer reviewed evidence happening. also ""magic scenario"" media pushing fearmongering.   Wow, even free vaccine it?   Seriously news media outlets need freakin accountability.

I’m sure people defending original comment millions kids could die, kids aren’t dying COVID end of.

It’s statements like dividing America, know twats one side keep hearing statements like pushes away truth.

I saw UK well, there’s people one side don’t believe COVID real, there’s people side think COVID like plague, reality it’s actually right middle.

The real reason COVID issue deadly virus, lives long enough hosts pass vulnerable people, children. think cdc said vaccinated people breakthrough infections similar viral loads unvaccinated folks virus, therefore spread virus others easily. that’s get breakthrough infection first place, think still relatively rare (less rare delta). What's stat vaccine related deaths? really appreciate this. helps put things statistical perspective. would disagree statement can’t fix “stunted” kids. would imply don’t ability motivation change social habits. aren’t easy reach, doesn’t mean impossible. river blindness

I don’t much pity unvaccinated anymore- healthcare workers, children, people might accidents health problems need critical care won’t get hospitals overrun.

The JNJ vaccine much temperature stable. It’s also one going used boosters, already donated risk countries most, since won’t worry getting people show second shot too.

I believe they’re still trying push US well, since it’s RNA (which uneducated people think change DNA) worry someone fence vaccinated come back… I’m donating much can. Wasting hospital resources effects everyone. can’t plan enough make logistics work. however, hear out, let people go shopping make safe possible. Depending cruise line he's taking, going cruise could actually lot safer lot things. parents going cruise next week really pretty worried mentioned restrictions.

Welcome logical change. sounds like hazing answer mandate everyone getting vaccine settled Supreme Court 100 years ago. Jacabson vs Massachusetts case we're counting COVID cases people visiting, we're counting vaccinations people?

Actually, yeah, tracks. important point. still data hospitalizations fatalities, worst missing data non hospitalized cases, whether they're symptomatic asymptomatic. absolutely blame  manager like right now. Dude practically lives work, obvious dislikes home life. put unfair pressure everyone else ""go beyond"" plus get fucking break all.  

Hate everyone gets punished one person can't manage life properly. company did.  go office even wanted. (well, supposed traveled HQ state, even that's heavily downsized.) 

Also, mean couldn't. point they've shown way. Shown actually benefit large office spaces. could save shit ton money also help environment using office spaces absolutely necessary. good reason donate poor country, them.

Why chose South Korea, knows. Presumably part reasoned could distribute effectively within remaining lifespan, fresher vaccines could used middle-income countries less developed distribution network.

Leaping 'ulterior motives' pretty silly. Yeah that's do... see one opinion rising top types threads redditors by-and-large introverts work tech trying convince they're productive valuable working home. might true folks think many deluding want keep ability nap middle day. long state emergency allowed, think last forever?

Apparently stopped many people leaving - including hr person usually exit interviews. really think they're doing. going big repeat ""you need masks unless hospital worker."" Instead giving us truth, they're feeding narrative get people want do. They'll throw statistics like .0015% vaccinated people gotten breakthrough infection.  vaccine obviously 99.9985% effective. 

I really worry going give vaccinated people false sense security going lead breakthrough infections rather vaccinations.  Much way initial messaging masks lead people believe masks work. 

Anyway, indication effective vaccines are, Ventura County roughly 77% vaccination rate, 13% detected cases breakthrough infections. That's better statistic me. shows vaccines effective, silver bullet. sent network eat it.

Great job!! management class knows real value. find frankly offensive deadly pandemic chief concern able micromanage workers get drunk perceived importance, then, real skills.    Ok. think we’ll know sure they’re planning doing? returned office mid-June hybrid option, basically WFH every day. I've enjoyed option much, gives best worlds great never deal commute, making lunch, waking earlier, etc. two days row.

People working onsite stimulates local economy, businesses, cafes, retail stores employ people work office environments. There's need people leave homes, least occasionally. South Australia WA well. Victoria currently knife edge. Well, cared (pre-pandemic) dipping toes partial WFH, idiot coworker decided want pay daycare spring break declared WFH. Except WFH discipline close zero. Log in, check email, watch hours TV, putz around kids, check email, rinse, repeat. single handedly ruined hope WFH entire department. 

Petty control freaks make difference; dumbass employee did. Managers work get deliverables fine - exist go meetings tell teams do? Yeah. Probably obsolete soon. Good guy senior leader. I’m sure WSJ would never quote you. still something like 250 per 100k cases, 20% ish vaccinated people percent wane by? wonder they’d save utilities cases.

I would recommend moving assumptions accusations asking questions.

One great example would asking interacted anyone travel events, prior testing. 

If asked that, I'd able tell work home, children, remained home guests time I've traveled I've received results tests.

For example, attended Hella Mega tour three days ago Pittsburgh. rt-PCR NAAT test today 2:20PM, upon returning home, I've gone grocery store bar neighbor's small gathering invited, receive results drive-through test day two.

I'm sure realize person immediately begin spreading virus directly exposure, I've drastically limited opportunity contributing asymptomatic spread literally encountering zero people could contagious period.

These tests free, quick, accurate, many people close home. 

It possible take little time mitigate risk others, testing large part that. Please consider telling people testing help, take little time understand efforts others may taking part effort end this, even efforts isolating may prefer. Oh ok. funny team like that. entire team voted don’t want meet go back. Came sales team offsite VP asked wanted one. “Nah I’m good” lol. We’re independent people self directed. 

It’s gonna fascinating going forward. company sinister size attitude exactly did. loving flexibility remote much happier well compensated now. seem like real pleasant douche bag He’s talking specifically Florida. really think Florida infect everyone kind herd immunity less year? Herd immunity doesn’t work Delta everything I’ve read.

Edit add:
I see reason think Florida vastly improved next summer compared summer. Unless situation changes, nothing place stopping virus outside vaccinations experts think waning. dinosaurs need retire ways need die. indeed going back. clawed back what’s we’re giving up.  think ones worried controlling / tyrannical types. like feeling power people obvious they're sitting next people fire moment reason (""at will"" employment). think remote work takes away lot rely actual stats, much like dislike employee personal level unrelated work performance, be. Employers believe remote work equates working hours day lose staff.

I’m glad employer actually suggests this, except exceptions, tell us log finishing time go relax will.  people say productive home, how?

I agree may happier likely want keep job…but productive?

With constant amount interruptions cellphones always taking attention “more productive” seems unlikely employees telling hoping managers bite.

I’m sure employees responsible enough ensure drop performance we’re taking averages mean’s find doubtful employees take advantage

It seems like false narrative.  safety protocols could follow mitigate spread wait safety studies wrap up. It’s role US Military deploy within US borders.

They last year could, force manned think indefinitely.

They manned rate supports stateside hospitals, limited overseas facilities. There’s simply capacity throw bodies raging pandemic citizens refuse fight.

As far “independent thinking,” that’s pretty poor take.

Poison control refuse take calls horse dewormer, people start learn ignorance affects people, much affects themselves.  Wisconsin No, countries acknowledged need others, order large amounts due fact. Florida 60% fully vaccinated Illinois. California 65% Pennsylvania 64%. 

It’s crazy difference mask wearing social distancing making based similar vaccinations rates amongst states. personally? would stop thinking. way Florida reporting would leave ordinary person believe there’s like 10 deaths day priority.

It's unbelievable people still pedding BS. repeat self: country prioritised based need. producers distributing vaccines based contracts, based needs most. Probably one-way flight definitely part problem. spreading misinformation themselves, many people spread COVID to? many healthcare workers patients without COVID put risk took hospital bed? many people couldn’t get bed surgery delayed people took one preventable disease?

Once Delta arrived, going spread quickly. vaccinated everyone would happened. Israel 60.1% fully vaccinated. countries named indeed higher, failed mention Netherlands (61.5%) United Kingdom (62%). That's 7 fully vaccinated countries Europe.

If also include partially vaccinated countries see following countries beat Israel well: Italy (66.1%), Finland (67.6%), Norway (68.3%) France (69.3%), puts Israel behind 11 European countries.

Ofcourse mostly due young population Israel means lot people simply eligible, think virus cares that. true. There's little inside areas, mainly little shops, open elements, ie doors. Agreed idea world vaccinated - outside eventual requirements proof vaccine like NYC - false. Supply isn’t issue needs addressed. Problem is, begging writing.

They can't read.  believe all, already spreading (like wildfire Delta) playing catching forever like rest world. Countries luxury possibility betting everything cut rest world delaying inevitable, vaccines good answer far want normal life. getting vaccinated step one, mentioned process *since vaccines became widely available.*

I travel regularly, took year pandemic. Since getting vaccinated Pfizer clinical trial, I've gotten tests days travel events make sure I'm asymptomatically spreading.

Vaccines finish line. follow mandates I'm longer staying home. There's next thing wait make us safer. need mandate vaccines. ""Trust science"" country, capitalize first word, names places. seeing random words capitalized feels weird me. thanks thorough reply, learned something new! Wtf??????? say offer them. said Israeli data shows breakthrough infections 60 lead hospitalization. 

Becoming infected seriously ill two different things. vaccine can't still stupid illness sixty, great win world people don’t trust establishment — government, media, pharmaceutical industry, aren’t trustworthy sources like would I. mistrust justified rest propagandized. issue trust one piece puzzle. Education another. lot people don’t critical thinking skills — like judging sources information, reading dissecting research studies etc. example don’t blindly trust government pharmaceutical industry. trust scientific community research results say vaccines safe what’s best that’s enough me. there’s tribal psychology sociology many issues. … hate might literally work also make stronger smarter romantic fight send small robot inside you. slippery slope. First employees become happier. Next they'll realize life outside work. can't *THAT*. happens, donate perhaps important verify safety effectiveness vaccine giving population whose immune behaves differently adult. want kids able get vaccinated, need make sure benefits weight risk. Thank correction! really blame me? 5 family members mine got it. One stroke longer walk. antivaxxers called ""liberal loon"" protecting others. cousin 15 year old son, refused get vaccinated despite living senior aged aunt recovered breast cancer, it. belittling insulting home infected stay family state. went take cousin pulse oximeter day STILL approached without mask. patience, tolerance, god help empathy gone. FUCK. THESE. PEOPLE. absolutely is. It’s prevent variants get global good nations think us favorably future. may direct translate, translates.

Then voters like think president defend significantly donating countries. know that. point rest world issues vaccination like US. actually recommended people get vaccines last ""rally""

The crowd booed guess black SUV 3 rows seating. ""Limo"" term used loosely I'm you, preferred could narrow date timeframe. least 7-day averages graphs still useful gauge. think highly people dependent. people good remote productivity drops, others excel greatly. think one things play person's strengths personal preference.  Totally agree. I’ve lived far family became platform could keep touch people far off.

It’s taken work time try keep garbage minimum, recently they’ve started pushing “Suggested articles” garbage sources. YouTube acted similarly, pushes minimize time both.  context, found article July 28th saying San Diego residents 12+ 70% fully vaccinated 85% gotton least one shot. unvaccinated making laege majority cases, hospitalizations, deaths, despite less places US. one Texas least ""some"" restrictions traveling Boston Florida vice versa? Train? Rented car? Reject vaccine= Reject doors.

Just wish. insanity Day day. Ontario seems temporary measures. Giving things short time means hospitals overwhelmed lead less death illness

r/noshitsherlock   want undermine confidence vaccine scientific data... Nobody tell things look like year now, long vaccinated get boosters, take proper precautions necessary time worry much it. trip NYC November still feel comfortable going booster + city requiring proof vaccination masks indoor activities. Overall pretty low risk long vaccinated. 

Really biggest worry would lockdowns ruining plans point there's probably 0% chance happening unless super vaccine resistant strain pops then. good point indeed. Isn’t capitalism great thing? Can’t stop wheels making money turning one minute. sad. Phil Valentine unvaccinated.

What's cause delay then? purchased late back queue? No, 95% efficacy symptomatic infection claimed based phase 3 results November Pfizer Moderna. New Zealanders gotta appreciate everything right, rest world partied like 1999.

Even vaccine (given prior unvaccinated) cases people survive that.

According Wikipedia, rabbies vaccine works well, even given people vaccinated prior exposure: idea people want pretend Covid vaccines ever 100%.

Besides R0, going comment OP asymptomatic people tested (perhaps true, mention mass testing), recent studies shown 3/4 Delta spread people feeling perfectly fine. Guardian article someone living NZ recounted everyone used normal daily routine even hours lockdown, run stores occurred maskless.

So given longer presymptomatic contagiousness Delta, possible hundreds infected moment, know several days. also American bias impossible entire country work protect itself, though, working together actually defeat outbreak far beyond comprehension haha. Like DHS study? Employers clueless, care.  Facebook social cancer, literally designed create echo chambers polarise people hardcore groups like-minded people reinforcing beliefs eachother however misguided sometimes plain horrific beliefs are. something want get chest: true reason government (and health professionals) want us get vaccine.

It slow spread Delta. prevent getting virus. prevents getting disease caused virus. decide we, individuals, want protect disease?

The answer matter think hoax overblown plot put magnets bodies, individual get's sick enough, go hospital. hospitals limited resource society needs preserved.

This truth. Getting vaccine protect anyone yourself. staying hospitals protects health care system whole. 

Can tell people this? get people accept truth speaking truth? That's chart says. says 65% fully vaccinated two jabs one jab type fully vaccinates, 8% one jab need second.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said NASACAR tho  I’ve severe phobia needles entire life tend faint around them. I’d rather unconscious vaccinated dead preventable disease Unpopular opinion: hate WFH. like spending day place sleep. made closest friends work best thinking done groups, battling things whiteboard. like water cooler culture. job requires bursts thinking ***really*** hard stuff. Small talk resets brain, prevents headaches gets ""unstuck"" ways solo activities like taking walk don't.

I go office fairly often, pretty empty (we currently policy ""only come want"") really quite eerie. totally selfish, want come back office, want everyone else come back well.

So articles like honestly give anxiety. Also, comment sections full ""wfh actually great, I'm never going back help it"" also sit well :( That’s scary, traumatic child. absolutely shocked kids didn’t get it. They’re also young vaccinated we’re exposed me. one household test positive symptoms, I’m grateful for. worry numbers overwhelm hospitals. Children's hospitals St Louis capacity. call tell them. Anonymously to.  disstancing. fucking entertainment park full people vacation. Sorry mate going Universal FL ""distancing"" feel like next step would making case reasonable people watch shows regularly. Proving roundabout way viewers actually able tell lying/misleading stuff is. Lmao yes fucking tool. literally stay home order. must misunderstood you. speaking employers- government company alike. experience. Started WFH 3 month old. Ended 16 month old. great 3 months (til mid June 2020) downhill there. actually doesn’t prove anything yet. first people get vaccinated higher risk people, therefore may higher risk contracting COVID post vaccination, regardless. Cure tho? good question, never like slippery slope arguments give enough credit implement law make something one case. pattern described people unhealthy things medical industry recommend prioritize lower list.

It's definitely good point question draw line. definitive answer that. regards food alcohol, think prove it. patient lie both. provide proof vaccination 

In addition, one life. Unhealthy food alcohol vastly important factor enjoyment life. bit tangled that. think misinformation causing this. example, know eat veggies less red meat, I'm balancing tradeoff longevity enjoyment. Whereas vaccines not. fact public schools mandate vaccines. issue politicized, also turning far conspiracy theories. Quit current job beginning month asking/telling us needed start going back in. Start new remote job money next week.  company can’t work everyone leaving. Two years only?

That Pandora's box going close anytime soon. Firm, posted record profits 2020 home, 18% increase revenue. Also iphones. prefer county level comparisons va State level. I.E. 55.3% Californians vaccinated. Stanislaus County, 41.52% vaccinated compared SF County, 72.03%. Guess county higher level COVID cases including pop density. Every day wake up, look sub still see many people fundamental understanding different 

a) vaccines 

b) antibodies 

c) vaccine derived antibodies 

d) spike mutations vaccine derived antibodies deal spike look like one warned vaccine

e) viral load relates covid sickness

f) virus 2000x viral load previous strains (and lambda worse).

How people could sub, understand things year reading tells fictional Dr. House right, want make lot money, invest tiny coffin companies. do. rule “If won’t protect friends, won’t sit friends.” hope so, too. couldn’t imagine getting second time vaccinated! Good luck!   100 - 300 mg. drinking horse dewormer concentrate, that's meant diluted animals water source. 

so 10 20 times dose meant people  musta got butt hurt drinking much mead Employers absolutely clueless toll office life takes every aspect existence.

No aren't. keep chained office less time find new job think much sucks. That’s good idea. lemon tree pick from. I’ll try today! Wow, incivil, tell y'all like references sub  Thank value judgement. I’m vaccinated, wearing mask, distancing everyone else. I’m part … none selfish. children contact either home. Mine cautionary post let others know safe place be. made feel better call selfish, I’m glad benefit morning. named quoted one doctors providing medical exemptions allow people get mask without qualifying medical condition. Facebook, like vast amount technology meant improve lives world, finds land Oh No! friendly leopards ate face! lost appetite overall. It’s coming back texture still important. understand Australia/NZ never seriously considered population wide testing. China figured back June last year blanketing area pooled testing far economically efficient solution problem. 

Previously, needed test city twice Delta, they've test cities 3 4 times still way catch people 2 steps chain exhibit symptoms seems what's needed get ahead Delta. understand people don’t like working home, shouldn’t give employees choice point? long I’m hitting production standards, deadlines, whatever, care I’m jamies not?  lot panic driven frantic media coverage. CDC isn’t helping things either.

The vaccines still work. Delta beast. breakthrough cases require hospitalization. Vaccinated hospitalizations overwhelmingly elderly immunocompromised. 

Also, natural post-infection immunity ignored discussions. people get COVID, virus going harder time finding naive hosts harder time spreading.

All pandemics eventually end. people become immune COVID, go deadly threat annoying cold, like human coronaviruses.

Immunocompromised elderly may need booster, everyone else fine. [There ain't coming us getting duct-taped office chairs bosses give shit us. seem like that! 45,000 flights per day US according FAA website. I’m surprised don’t hear stories like Yes, smell supposed support taste, cold sinuses plugged affects both. It’s understanding Covid, attacks olfactory nerves it’s necessarily sinus blockage inflammation nerves themselves. least that’s understanding it.  remain free prescription. But, thought people especially careful would never ingest anything FDA approved right? That’s kind strange since nowhere near hospitalizations back December thru January    Wow cool Middle management absolutely skill, done right, really important one. job middle manager a) make sure people know exactly supposed expected keep deliverables happening time b) acting bulldog get things done across functions people routinely throw barriers (as opposed team deal themselves) c) keeping upper management unjustly impacting work/life balance subordinates.

If 3 done successfully, makes everyone's life drastically better makes team efficient/successful. Good managers literally make break employment people. saying goes: ""people quit jobs, quit managers"". Probably good thing that's gonna come covid taste spice it’s vibrant usually is. hasn’t necessarily changed things taste me, food bland remember being. Especially meat taste seasoning like salt it’s strong enough.    Well that's encouraging vaccine put magical shield around you. virus still infect you. train immune system fight it, upper hand.

Delta higher viral load able more, body kills completly.

The vaccines work shows stats places like Los Angeles. past similar infection rate going hand hand higher hospitalization death, anymore.

Also Delta aggressive toward younger people original variant 

DHS study Wisconsin Oh Jasper guy pioneered think. approach extreme get desperate helped him. dream that. nearly slipped latrine Hong Kong, instead jumped. slipped smashed face back wall. count blessings I'd amputate legs. director, spend time actually able lay direction team, instead endless mind numbing meetings. It’s great  I’m sure focusing IFR children good metric go by. 

For instance, even mild cases COVID resulted microvascular damage brain heart—and former, people feel causes “brain fog” cognitive impairment issues long haul COVID. sure want see damage pattern pans children, decided low mortality rate meant somehow “immune” resistant. dragged, yeah. gov'munt tell OH HELP GOV'MUNT! Nononononononononono think horse deformed answer screwed already. Take want Sure, ignore China gone 300ish cases Delta day around 4 per day now. course, Western media's favorite past time ignoring China news good. going personal experience, felt like vaccinated may much worse unvaccinated. unvaccinated, holistic medicine promoting cousin younger hospital now.  That's factor too. insinuating vaccine give protection?  manager different state anyway, alongside lot company, called back work permanent hybrid basis (3 in, 2 out). I’m going take win, absolutely loved working full-time remote 15 months it. know states confidence intervals graphs states line?  hospitalization. people ignore risk covid short hospitalization, i.e. long covid. data place risks, don’t think there’s enough time delta schools say risks children there. Side-effects lot higher Moderna though. disagree, typical reddit - ask simple question get downvoted oblivion. subreddit specifically nothing echo chamber. siloed mean context? doesn’t exist unless maneuvers involve landing roof Memorial.  effectiveness 42%

lol joke

Is anybody working real vaccine long lines Polio, Rubella etc get one done forever protected? Bad managers poorly run companies worried. Good managers well run companies quite opportunity poach smart hard working employees. pandemic outed lot shitty managers, shitty companies, shitty work work environments. director ""Policylab"" Children's Hospital Pennsylvania said day they're seeing reason ring new alarm bells moment (even data South). recommendation ""caution"" opposed ""alarm"", made feel better situation kids. ""The media"" need anything ""covid continue"" got governors stopping elective surgeries, requesting medical ships ventilators feds, needing state medical staff augment local personnel.  tried already timezone diff, culture staff turnover knowledge work caused extra time expense ""reshored""  Tell work. Oh vaccinated. Oh take mask desk. 

Fuck life. hate can't live like this. subject cynical *now* - number discussions I've people tell get vaccine ""because immune system"" made reevaluate esteem held share fundamental level basic understanding things work.

18 months pandemic, knee-jerk response inside (that resist displaying) ""*Really? This* start?"" former consultant, this. Especially less experienced. spent two hours figuring something out, would often bill one less since mind inexperience made take longer. 

By end consulting life, billing nearly everything though since experienced enough something took two hours truly two hour problem. 

Doesn’t mean managers still weren’t writing shit client bitched. Economist modeling estimated true death toll COVID [around 10 million back lot countries severely undercounting, excess deaths lie. hope encourages get vaccinations would still beneficial well.   Polio, Mumps, Rubella...etc. One done, works forever.

Seems like covid one coin flip. industry based billing clients every 15 minutes work, meaning, record I’m billed 7 hours day. bs little, say spent 3 hours x, better something show workers essential one way another comes location flexibility work done. 

Grocers, gas stations/convenience stores, pharmacies health care workers real MVPs sure. think lot people knew masks would still rejected, assumed people would get vaccinated. Sure would anti-vaxxers, nearly half country. Was/am technically still manager remote worker force confirm this. role essentially turned middle man position required less effort part workers proved could remain productive home. Seeing writing wall, transitioned new position essential company professionally fulfilling. media government loves talk shit vaccines. numbers paint clear pictures: vaccine works wonders. problem due various reasons, way many unvaccinated people. goal getting EVERYONE vaccinated.

But cruise safe vaccinated, they?

What’s point lying people get vaccinated? get anti-vaxxer rather progress.. exactly! live alone time, isolating WFH 24/7. also nice flexibility come in. don’t understand managers care forcing people work one building work getting done everyone home.  wondering this, too. going 2001 markedly violent protests. stupid thing managers directors worried on.

Because value questioned. could’ve good position right better managed vaccinations  usually argue masks ineffective (*I'm saying this, studies behind disagree completely*) wear one, definitely wear n95 similar hurt say can't breathe (of course they're less comfortable usually bad short time people need wear indoors front line workers, especially hospitals, wear day, 5+ days week).  look past surges starts make sense. one worst hit places world. deaths per capita 50% higher FLORIDA. we’re smaller state hasn’t much media coverage suffering here.

Long story short- covid harder time spreading amongst population insane amounts immunity past infections vaccinations. I'm parent I'm concerned child missing school every virus floating around year immunity building them, dying CoVid. think parents boat. 

For majority us, CoVid likened child getting flu. sucks. die. mean still want minimize risk much possible. big Fortune 500 corps concerned unproductive long-term leases huge office buildings campus complexes. Like big box retailers they're tied properties years end, they're costly terminate. commute absolute best part. 45 minute commute way COVID accident highway. brother-in-law same, apparently covid vaccine first time *didn't* faint receiving injection!  saying zoo, there's literally different vet type animal? Seriously? believe that? smoking catnip again, you? someone's goal return slavery would way they'd that. want husband go back office. I’m sick home quiet every time he’s meeting phone. take day work (I work hospital can’t work home) want able relax. want house back sick sharing work. Mine driving home work. live 1.5 hours away work college intern. make employees get vaccine wear masks employ Found idiot thread. professor industrial hygiene class explained disposable masks good stopping droplets good stopping aerosols really want stop aerosols (which explained caronavirus transmitted) need wear KN-95. 

He also explained CDC knowing information didn’t tell us beginning pandemic wanted make sure KN-95 masks saved healthcare workers. 

To anyone knowledgeable true statements? One thing people don’t think money created people going office. lose people buying gas, buying food, traffic tickets(speeding, parking, etc), people buying stuff stores, etc. one going anywhere, money dries up. 

I support work home. think going office dumb. People driving less would help environment ton. think that’s much pushback WFH. built economy run people going out. Two negative PCR tests, assuming administered correct time frame, would considered highly, highly reliable. going ""vaccinated people pass Covid other"" that's reason people can't go theme parks, literally saying nobody ever go theme park bad thing?

So can't hover employees work micromanage them?

I feel like lead exodus shitty unnecessary managerial positions rather decline sort productivity.

My mental physical health improved 10x since started working home, result, Ive found I'm positive every aspect life actually want contribute job.

In world bad anybody except put place keep status quo? Pro tip: get choose work. kind situation, would advise make efforts get different role different organization treated right.

But would still sad people feel way, would probably complain Reddit. No, active cases. BC never seen anything close kind daily case numbers.     would love live world shitty little pay'n'park dumps went business, sold 5% many cars used to. 

Yes yes know ""BUT ECONOMEE""

Maybe set stuff wrong buy cars drive circles buying fast food keep money moving around move around (and course, inevitably upward) Yeah, I'm concerned fact since schools basically dropped precautions kids getting sick literally every fucking virus floating around right now. kid school week already fever cough RSV virus floating around. 

It hospitalization miserable sick kid. Oh man really can't imagine life let little things frustrate much, yeah, get coming guess. I'm saying there's people get vaccine avenues explore get people safe clogging hospitals explore it. Thats all. good rest weekend dude. Thank you. I'd love show this, think he's firmly dug in, unfortunately. words ""lots doctors"" ""vets"" (you know, people famously treat non-humans.)

We UK, fortunately good uptake people like kept things opening (for now), want safe possible.

I agree friends everything, really makes think twice around him. One, potential risk, two, think stance idiotic. Correct, unless variant emerged vaccine effective - antivaxxers pose threat vaccinated. Still see everywhere. post Seattle sub Washington reinstated mask mandate last week number people saying ""why? Masks work."". take dump router room. hit fuck couple friends believe ***EVERYONE***, regardless ethnicity, receiving injections sort drug suppresses immune system likely become sick. claim pharmaceutical companies increase dependence medicine. grown ass men careers, wives, children, homes, somehow navigate society function. 

Shit wild!

I glad less people attending gym asking people proof vaccination. get work done home office. Agreed. Excellent read. like musk, god satellites work I'd suck god dammed dick. Internet infrastructure America unimaginably terrible country, hughesnet satisfy. exactly mean this? Bosses scared. bosses seen productivity going even people staying home, see opportunity cut office expenses. middle management become redundant scared shitless. I’m spreading misinformation. See Bill Lee’s Executive Order 84 made August 16, 2021.

Manager fully vaccinated still got sick know doesn’t prevent sickness, severe infection it'll really expensive difficult even make luxury housing. way they'll affordable ultra rich hard manage case loads without completely upending life. govts loathe continue completely upending economy places point.

How much cognitive issues come severe disease, mechanical ventilation? What's rate cognitive issues associated mild illness?

Unfortunately really hard say ""yeah lock again"" point, noone wants that, lockdowns mixed results. 75-fold reduction ICU cases vaccinated enough satisfy personally.

A nasal attenuated vaccine ideal would build type antibodies associated often respiratory system, providing shield need illness. They're trialing suspect it'll yearly vaccine forever. issue whether live attenuated vaccine issue CHADOX thromboses created vaccine interacting body. Noone accept vaccine 1/100000 blood clot rate.

But COVID going forever. mammals ACE2 spike-attachment sites always animal reservoir (they found antibodies white tailed deer, species whose interaction humans getting shot). hope doesnt mutate animals far deadlier, like SARS Classic 10% CFR.

And feel I'm saying give up, I'm not. Refining treatments, better vaccines go long way make less threatening. I'm realistic. I’ve back n grey windowless cubicle hell 2 months now. Despite Delta Variant committed person. Probably something fact management super boomers should’ve retired 15+ years ago can’t “my finances aren’t there”. Probably shouldn’t taken second mortgage boomer!   27 y.o Western Canada here. second dose 3 weeks ago. open clinic days later anyone without appointment could come get vaccine. 45 nurses 8 hour shifts 24 hours applied well 18,000 doses.

At point, people vaccinated want it, fine,you you.

Our federal government announced unvaccinated people living Canada allowed denied access non essential businesses movie theatres, resteraunts, pubs, etc.

Im perfectly fine showing proof vaccination means go back enjoying favourite local eateries without worrying half baked anti vaxxer yelling sweaters asking politely wear mask seated. We've pandemic 18 months. think glaringly obvious enough. would accurate reading comments, yes Same. companies front line managers still want wfh. Even directors want wfh. ""senior leaders"" can't get times. Same. like WFH 90% time. get office interactions coworkers. met many people never would seen always WFH even made acquaintances friends. Unless directly work someone literally never talk reason so. tracing nice all, basically stopped second untraceable community spread.

In words, gave prematurely suffered consequences. Likely never implemented diligently effectively first place. certainly case here. Basically, public health officials ask questions follow anything, new mind testing asymptomatic contacts. stopped even that. run tech dept. office closed down, boss would go in. required come entire time REMOTELY MEET PEOPLE INTHE BUILDING! f'in tired old people can't see stupid is.   Don’t mistake public agreement actual desire Long covid mainly got two doses.

Unfortunately, looking like long covid much affected whether vaccinated - catch covid, almost likely unvaxxed person get long covid.

But course, less likely catch covid, protection - strong protection getting high number unvaccinated adults would logically mean high number children ICU logical even lower chances developing severe cases

I think misunderstood point. point rate severe outcomes children high enough children's hospitals becoming would like information mandating next generation vaccinated vaccine know long term effects. 

I would love information, but... late. simple risk management - small risk vaccine vs. large risk covid.

But, correct comes *mandating* this, valid arguments sides. take view what's better society large do.

Which say, mandating vaccinations harm N people whereas mandating vaccinations see people harmed, N, mandate vaccinations. trolley problem territory, there's easy answer. Minors abusive parents. Spouses children, need financial support use green cards. There’s lot things make extremely difficult. unless you’ve situation, can’t claim “get relationship” helpful answer.

Still available majority Africa. places got hit Delta first starting see contractions now. send details Reuters AP CNN? would great expose. sorry hear that. Hope get better soon.  Answer questions, please:

You claim know answers, you?

If know answers, present evidence concerned.

If evidence concerned, even here? Buddy, swap nations blink eye. Well, vaccine effectiveness starts really high. Like exceedingly high. problem effectiveness wanes viral load delta overpowering immune system natural antibody production decreases time. Boosters get us back high 80s low 90s appears. Polio simply never replicated fast enough us constantly high antibodies floating around. body detect time mount response. Covid specifically delta, goes ham. Vaccines still reaaaally good eventually winning things get bad.

I think we'll eventually end flu + covid combo shots possibly early intervention medicines. Apart that, literally everyone wins.  

I support Remote work, dont think simple. industries revolving around offices.   

* offcie Cleaning companies (facility management)
* Restaurants food-services (companies deliver food office canteens, operate entirely)

Specifically Texas Florida. statistics comparing number hospitalized Covid 19 vaccinated vs aren't? cannot seem find that, unless hidden somewhere seems claims ""vaccinated filling hospital beds"" baseless extrapolations old data -- necessarily untrue, one actually proving true. Um...good?  Look data again. Ages 15-24 \*are\* shooting up. Sure look like back school me. ages 0-14 (the upper half) likely ""shooting up"" tested.

The upper half 20-24 group may largely school driving epidemic segment. mean 20-22 group driving school spread.  30 days long enough?  find odd grown person would vacation theme park without children. doesn’t sound like good time covid. guess different strokes all. hate publicly.

Ugh. I’m sorry. 84, Clark Allen looked forward years grandchildren. got vaccinated last winter, hoping stay safe. summer, delta surged Florida, COVID-19 found him.

... exactly worried about? WTF TLDR: we’re still trying mixture poor work habits enough employees pushed management work stop remote work.

I agree principle fully support remote work job employee good fit remote work. two lessons learned hard way 1) jobs full time remote-work candidates majority (speaking company) 2) requires discipline employee side matched right supervisor. sent everyone home last Spring trying balance seems impossible pin ever since.

Sometimes employees consider work home reason come site even needed (putting new home schedule needs job). clear site requirements weren’t gone people wold recognize physical presence may needed tasks shouldn’t surprise, pushback big. paradigm shift management everyone ready (not majority experience). supervisors cannot manage remote workers effectively (the remote folks either get ignored left micromanaged). Also sadly, lazy employees viewed work secondary task basically simply watching email. Spring 2020 everyone giving benefit doubt folks - it’s rotten apples ruining rest.  little bit shaky - comparative numbers. Generalized 'control' control (taking averages socioeconomic status factors).

Also, year underemployment undersocialization might play mild cognitive decline 'mild' group. found vocabulary shrunk quite bit, likely talking much.  course there's articles ""people jump line booster shots"" US. Search Vaccine Booster see bunch articles, namely one ABC.

In it, health experts say ""getting booster 8 months *bad*, help really. Plus cutting line, jerk.""

I'm sorry, US throwing tons doses week? desperately ill people getting boosters people scrambling get 3rd doses? No. chance.

In CA Bay Area, get appointment today! Times plentiful. Israel gives ages 65+ booster around 5 month mark, US saying 8 months this...

“A lot young people thinking they’re invincible, immunity virus, ” said Dr. Gulshan Sharma, hospital’s chief medical officer. “A lot (young) people keep looking mortality rate 1 percent 2 percent, mortality rate either 100 percent 0. ... Either going walk going die.”

A young, healthy population thought equipped handle coronavirus hit reality check significantly contagious delta variant. Medical experts say lagging vaccine rates among young adults fueled another surge sending hospitals greater numbers, stretching health care capacity throughout Texas

Previously pandemic, people age 65 made majority hospitalizations nationwide, according Centers Disease Control Prevention data. trend began shift April, vaccines became widely available. Aug. 7, people hospitalized fall within 18 49 age range, CDC reports.

In Texas, COVID infecting people 30s age group, 17,400 cases. People 20s close second, 15,900 cases.

Meanwhile, average daily COVID hospitalizations Texas Medical Center — 369 — surpassed all-time high 360 set July 2020.

For exhausted medical personnel front lines, availability vaccines makes current trend frustrating disturbing.

“They don’t want get vaccine, we’re trying save them,” said UTMB nurse Marre Dang, working two straight weeks hospital. “And get younger younger.”

Unvaccinated surge
While health officials consider need additional vaccine doses vulnerable groups, shots proven highly effective throughout current surge. Moderna Pfizer said 90 percent effective preventing symptomatic illness, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine roughly 73 percent effective.

Breakthrough infections possible rare, according Kaiser Family Foundation study published July 30. study found breakthrough infections represent “well below” 1 percent COVID cases. overwhelming majority hospitalizations — 97 percent — among unvaccinated.

Even so, 59 percent eligible population fully vaccinated nationwide, compared 54 percent eligible Texans. Nationally, 45 percent people 18 24 age group fully vaccinated, compared 82 percent 65 74, according CDC.

Those statistics playing Houston region.

Burchardt also needs machine. third man ECMO died hospital last week, said UTMB nurse Yolanda Leyva, leads ECMO program there.

“We giving chance wouldn’t had,” said.

ECMO aggressive treatment primarily used younger patients, said. survival rate machine roughly 50 percent, according American Lung Association. Using three ECMO machines one time “unheard program,” Leyva said.

Young patients need critical care UTMB hospital also rarely underlying health problems, ICU nurse Audriana Suhey said.

“Before, seeing older patients, lot heart disease, diabetes, things,” said. “And patients don’t things. 20- 30-year-olds coming fighting lives.”

‘Really sick, really fast’
Young people dropping average age COVID patients general hospital beds ICUs. Houston Methodist said average age ICU patients dipped 64 last surge 54, 12 percent patients 20s 30s. UTMB Health also said average COVID patient 10 years younger.

Out approximately 40 COVID patients ICU United Memorial Medical Center hospitals, 60 percent 30 45 years old, said Dr. Joseph Varon, hospital’s chief critical care.

In Memorial Hermann system, people 20 50 years old make roughly 65 percent COVID hospitalizations, said system CEO President Dr. David Callender. CHI St. Luke’s Health-The Woodlands Hospital recently 79 COVID patients, 17 age 45, said Dr. Syed Raza, hospital’s vice president medical operations.

“That something seeing before,” Raza said. “Before delta, lot age group would get cold flulike symptoms, time able take care home.”

There firm evidence points severe illness younger patients contract delta. Anecdotally, medical professionals give mixed answers.

Raza said younger patients experience coughing, shortness breath abdominal pain associated diarrhea. cases, condition appears deteriorate rapidly earlier pandemic, said. Nurses UTMB share sentiment.

“With delta, seems like get really sick, really fast — faster last summer,” UTMB nurse Claire Whited said.

In Callender’s experience, delta variant making young sick older patients earlier pandemic, similar percentage requiring critical care Memorial Hermann. change severity also difficult determine among children, said Dr. Michael Chang, pediatric infectious disease specialist UTHealth Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital.

He said conflicting evidence might explained sheer number infections. COVID cases young people naturally cause greater chance severe cases population, said.

“It sounds like stories kids getting sicker — that’s impression would get,” said. “But time it’s difficult know, delta different variants it’s contagious.” entire healthcare system willfully sacrificed anti maskers anti vaxxers. It’s access. 

We since July getting getting large quantities vaccine.

Currently 72% people 40 booked vaccination. rest population eligible 1 September. Yes. Fight Covid deaths vaccine. Fight social inequalities ways times. I’d looking WFH gig years. Found one 2019 life changing. Commute prior 1.5-2 hours one way. Took pay cut quality life increased much, stress decreased much, worth it.

I’ll never understand companies don’t allow remote work there’s technical reason preventing it. feeling people going use anti-vax propoganda. management hired onboarded 100% remote pandemic.  Good employees still stand-out. standing virtually, likely stood in-person. Either way, getting promotion.

One interesting thing consider, traditionally, people tended promote people look like (often white males), tall, good looking, etc. possible remote work help remove unconscious bias often applied promotion opportunities. may make promotion opportunities equitable. ain't going back.

...

^I'll ^go ^back.  May have, did, said we’d never know had. said wife time working HR job lot people exposure. It’s already available immunocompromised. 

Nobody knows yet gen population. indication fed authorities give approval next month. Availability come soon that, days. love work home. don’t ever want go back. 

There one downside acknowledge though, that’s problem living nyc small space. 

Staring work corner gives ptsd, hate job. fucking despise it. Covid doesn’t melt steal. current death count, reflects six newly-discovered fatalities, NCHS lists country’s first COVID death week Jan. 5-11 — first full week 2020. agency final stages preparing 2020 annual mortality report, review analysis deaths United States last Swartzberg thinks — new death data suggests — it’s entirely possible COVID present United States early December even November. time infection death COVID typically around three “I would certainly guess virus introduced multiple occasions identified problem,” Swartzberg said, noting states like Alabama Oklahoma don’t generally see lot travel Memoli National Institutes Health “I always thought U.S. well identified big problem,” Memoli said. there's ""jumping line"". Florida basically walk Publix, CVS, Walgreens others ask shot. got plenty them. states even throw away vaccines they've expired cause enough people take them. far I'm concerned, safe let people get 3rd shot. Maybe use different plane comparison. 737s unpleasant on, I'd much rather 787. anything involves non-sensitive data clerical work, work home inevitable probably next major change society. look technology savvy businesses use Discord, Zoom, Slack, Teams, tools. kind networking going keep growing integrating business world. VR matures later decade, probably find place too.

Companies agencies going backward old ways like we're ""Office Space"" going become dinosaurs business world, like late 1990s Sears reinvesting retail stores ignoring online shopping. Companies took advantage COVID situation move people remote work going come ahead game. Obviously would need exceptions health required religious reasons.

Outside that, fuck em. Get vaccinated find job elsewhere. +100 mean, want ass, sounds like need lock door heart ignore kids working. all, ""bad"" may sound, that's *exactly* want going office -- putting physical distance ""justify"" ignoring. make arrangements make work everyone away, surely keep arrangements going even happen physically home.

(Sure, might impossible home small there's literally single room could isolate in, I'm sure noise ideal even happening directly next -- then, offices quite noisy too)

It seems like lot issues people WFH stem preconceptions supposed work necessarily concept itself, like common complaint ""I never get log work now"" (so go ahead that? turn computer, shut Slack, whatever achieve purpose?)

Not reason care others want keep working office. that's works you, means go ahead. seems significant percent people position want actual benefit inherent working office, rather part routine serves ""excuse"" sort justify something want feel confident enough straight demand (despite being, part, entirely reasonable)  TLDR: CDC retroactively added covid-19 deaths. new first covid-19 death week Jan 5, 2020 - Jan 11, 2020. ~3-4 weeks earlier previous first known death early Feb. Man would hate me. Sometimes log weekend rarely. wouldn’t respond Monday 9 likely. gave shit would apologize start looking another job. exit interview would make known don’t appreciate expected respond emails weekend.

Toxic people #1 reason stop giving fuck completely job minimum. hire normal C dude give time figure out? Fortran likes certainly learnable types. reason hold someone comes pre-cooked. 

And really that's true virtually tech positions. Even hiring fortran guy fortran project, java java, etc there's lead time figure _your_ code. Learning new syntax along codebase probably slow things much competent programmers. seem worth waiting 6 months perfect candidate. No, unless showed insurance driver’s license/ID. else need record information? Traffic back normal :( initial reasoning, point get vaccinated. whatever reason couldn't, N95 available. really feel like permanent WFH, least plurality *white-collar* workforce, we're headed. employees want certain point acquiesce simply retain workers. 

I want repeat one words first sentence though: white-collar.

There segments service economy absolutely depend white-collar workers headed office every day. think urban neighborhood desk located: coffee shops, lunch places, grocery stores catered 'on way home crowd', hotels survive conference attendees, etc, etc.

It's easy argue folks almost two years figure point, they? thousands service employees depend jobs pay rent feed kids figured still depending aid hoping things go back normal?

I'm denying WFH desirable going happen lot people. country (I'm US clear) increasing economic divide, can't help believe exacerbates becomes likely urban office neighborhoods going seriously depopulated, come back all. agree. feel like would easy Trump administration made masking patriotic thing do. Appreciate post know exactly coming from. Hope get vacation unscathed. want hijack thread, work healthcare go office, expected there, since I'm deemed essential worker, pandemic.  luxury getting office able phone in.

As manager, I'm office 1 2 days week needed. I'm really glad decided embrace remote working. said, calling team scheduling Teams meetings, may like. I'm hands try ""micro manage"". complaints far. folks small kids hear background meetings. I'm sure saving bunch money able work home. downside this? newer, recent “version” available? Shit federal government Dug hole dragging feet administering vaccines already available months. Thank you! things hate enforced “meaningful get togethers” colleagues. It’s truly shocking many companies think outside work hours perfectly acceptable. want get together colleagues damn well better paid otherwise asking give personal time (you know, time spend friends family) instead spend people mostly don’t like. love god make something everyone actually wants do.

I group friends work get together outside work occasion, people I’m genuine friends with.

Removing negative things would make happier employees happier That's good point although think airlines announced week they're going allow people test positive unvaccinated people fly domestic flights know International though. I’m traveling Arizona November Tennessee January. 

Fun times. IBM largest tech company they’ve remote work well decade. articles sponsored corporations talking remote work lasting two years shit One man’s draconian another man’s rational response.
I one think lockdowns vast overreach government power - nationwide unlawful detention innocent civilians, logic, I’m responsible negative things come I’m speaking out.

Our nation filled many boot lickers educated government schools resist tyranny find in. people think lockdowns COVID vaccines good thing, ends justify means.
Those would sacrifice liberty security deserve neither. people replaced commute meetings work, causing 12 hour days. 

Trying get people stop uphill battle half folks US terrified losing job available time, half think bragging long hours badge honor. 

Folks, team can’t work 40 hours week, either don’t shit together, can’t prioritize shit , understaffed—sometimes three. Good. Get vaccinated get work. want get vaccinated, cool get back work. can't get vaccinated reasons, get pack N95s get work. older planes going useful much longer anyways! Well work way better remote seems co-workers well. according company, good year profit-wise. seriously don’t understand managers concerned with, maybe fucking embrace dinosaurs. Agreed, work-from-anywhere ideal solution.  lived within 15 minutes office, I'd likely go 2-3 days per week WFH 2-3 days per week. lived 15-45 minutes office, I'd likely go per week. 45+ minutes, I'll go every weeks.

Won’t housing one need live work Lol, stones guy, 'I want go back want everyone else go back too, that's works best me!' So, worried won’t go back.

Couple solutions

Cut pay remote workers… it’s fair people go work

You’re boss.. remote work productive want office, well fire them.

Require covid vaccines, pay office.

Outsourcing remote work happen remote jobs don’t fool thinking won’t happen think lot depends job. I'm software developer, used lose *so much* time people stopping chat I'm struggling maintain mental model something.

even covid, uncommon people (not devs) come weekend office empty.

To original question though, estimates vs actuals *way high* (roughly 40%) first started WFH. Based I'm 30-40% productive.

That said, recognize jobs benefit isolation. Unless it’s coming conservative leaders conservative media outlets, matter one bit. Reddit needs too. local sub people suggesting COVID parties posts left it’s insanity. I've productive year life far. even close. They're never getting back office. allergic reactions, necessarily side effects. think stomach upset reported side effect common, think vomiting either. got super unlucky crazy rarely vomit like, 5 years, haha personal hell. that's really good know bad reactions 2nd dose booster. Maybe wont bad That’s lot conjecture spun analysis.

Look highly-vaccinated places. impact significantly lessened. 

The virus different, it’s magic. basically WFH every day

God, that's like absolute worst case scenario. 

The lack consistency would tank productivity. 

I much creature habit. 

We 3 day power outage recently, back office 2 days keep working. stressed &amp; unproductive, everything different. Different monitor layout, different keyboard, time wasted getting ready &amp; driving in. 

NOPE. 

One me, none hybrid bullshit. ""Hybrid"" management playing long game anyway, retract &amp; WFH days back office full time wanted it. bad. going cause huge outbreak around people crammed rescue shelters.  I've trying ability work home since beginning. 

I covid (fully vaccinated). Suddenly work ability let work home. started past Friday. got done one day whole week last worked onsite. coworker distractions, stress traffic/parking ruin morning... Just, wake up, coffee, login. 

It took losing sense smell taste finally dose happiness damn job. false equivalency drawn pointed here. One distrust based history, current events, science; distrust based paranoia, fear, hate.

I can't blame them, damn, 3 best developers hurt company hard. can't imagine team one facing potential exodus, either. used live Texas gulf coast. People vaccinated directly threatening everyone else might:

Mandate vaccinations. loud freedum crowd freedom kill fellow citizens, never did.  Pfizer. So, either Jefferson Fayette county? 

My city kinda hipster, left leaning awesome, county much way. tends towards gloom doom pessimism. I’m totally it! remote work becomes norm (as probably will), core life residential neighborhoods again. Wherever people move to, types services either move well disappear, also new ones appear. People want cafes neighborhoods, cornerstores, boutiques, spas, co-working spaces depending type neighborhood, etc. 

It's gonna blow certain industries, something else replace them. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Almost every formerly zero-COVID country moving onto vaccinations long-term NPIs. boosters end increasing protecting transmission, anticipate even changes mitigation strategies. 

The US' issue really lack lockdowns, central institution enforce mandates nationwide since states far much power.  maybe adapt? Preach it. It’s obvious. Look around, living result it.  catching covid non issue many young kids. compare risk serious side edge vaccine vs risk catching covid causing serious issue. Yes. arguing vaccination CAUSED mutation fraught. 

Mutations need survivability pass on. Vaccinations reduce spread. virtue reducing spread, vaccines reduce mutation spread. Even vaccine 60% efficacy reduce spread. 

If mutation occurs individual spread occurs mutation dies them. key component highly vaccinated populations less spread. want preface with: like job. like people work with.

I very...concerned extent people organization revolve around depend work. worked many places. swear people desperate everyone go back office social lives depend too. work there, friends there, socialize work work colleagues, marry coworkers remote work really affected them.

I like job want ever them. going back November regardless bad Covid gets. 3 days 2 days every week. 160 month parking 90 min commute.

I’ve trying find new data analytics role remote since powers announced weeks ago Well yea, everyone super independent secret genius held back management. Beginning Monday = Make sure spread much aka definitely heavily abused. health situation may ask? Stuff like bodyweight such. Everything's bigger Texas right? Right? Good Imagine generalizing entire race, comparing niche group. wonder certain people skeptical entire situation... absolutely going back They’re right, find equally skilled workers less overseas remote.

yeah we're looking equally skilled workers there, 3 months 3 jobs. Also can't really send financial stuff overseas.  hear “it’s vaccine” **so often**. Usually followed “it gene therapy”.

Neither accurate. vaccine. isn’t gene therapy (RNA affect DNA). 12k worst case scenario breaks rapidly herd immunity developing. look powerpoint story, moderate projections peak 5k BC implements safety measures (which will) peak 2k. 

AND, least Ontario, projections always overestimated spread waves. surprised models twice we'd actually see reality. 

12k sells papers though, that's headline.  It’s iffy say CDC “knew” anything start. genuine concerns masks might actually counterproductive first, spread touching surfaces, wasn’t clear time, wearing mask caused people touch faces more, sometimes does, masking general public might increased risk instead lowering it. 

Of course, know surface transmission isn’t thing one, people wear masks without fiddling them. (Though do, weren’t totally wrong there.) problem messaging. said “It won’t help,” definitely, admitted didn’t know making educated guess based best info time, guidance could change, made look deceptive instead replaced better evidence.   Mutations random, whether mutation become winning mutation not, affected environment. less competition mutation faces, likely mutation would go dominant one. Would agree that? parents probably resources flexibility take time work take care kids. may evil/bad parents there, majority send kids symptoms school can't afford stay home watch them. Humans stupid. uproar guy BLOCKING mask mandates LEAST schools. isn’t blocking laws seat belts?! God, people stupid. Austria. That's reason quite lot companies change HO agreements currently avoid paying full workplace. get like 3€ per day HO equipment internet power etc capped 300€ per year.  C dude going take job frontan take C job. None things are, imo really be, tied employment.

Having healthy positive constructive relationships coworkers,. (or ""can be"") beneficial thing. get done (and likely happier it),. like people work with. Exactly this. vaccine preps immune system, almost certainly period infection symptoms show vaccine would semi-valuable - you’re talking span days infection, maybe hours. time symptoms show up, it’s late - body knows situation, already fighting pathogen.

And even symptoms, somehow could guess infected, it’ll still **far** less effective multi-vaccine course several weeks now. Middle TN areas, believe. Many lost lives many missing.

And, record, I’m US. dog fight. get it. employers insist people work office (or even more) productive working home? could save money office space downsizing, come absolutely needed. Yeah, city 575, reports like, 250 cases everyday (and test way way lower New Zealand sure) person spends weekends indeed looking remote positions think guy might onto something. I’m aware of, mutations random. 

Viruses like bacteria, either.

Ascribing causality problem. Delta would reached America even everyone US vaccinated. 

Vaccination status nothing ones ability carry virus. 

And argument, people vaccinated, would fact see breakthrough cases. already happening. would it. 

And contrast, less people vaccinated would less breakthrough cases. 

So what’s point? asked leading question clearly sided purveyors covid disinfo CDC getting kids Covid symptoms, absolutely. pediatric ER slammed kids Covid symptoms 24/7 right now. many aspects WFH,. varies environment environment (and workplace workplace). 

I definitely value ""socializing work"" (or ""trading insights opinions"")

I think tons examples ""having 2nd pair eyes"" ended catching something (or approaching problem different way).. things would never thought of. (and helped us saves hours (or days weeks) time. view vaccines -only- answer myopic cause lot deaths. nice tool have, we've basically decided throw away method control thing. magic bullets. 

I'd like live world $ equally go investigating treatments, funding social mitigation measures (capacity limits, ventilation requirements, etc), funding make schools safer (many 100+ year old buildings 30+ kids tiny classroom!), promoting safe work environments. serious investments made issues CDC basically told everyone, vaccinated, everythings normal again. Shortly? FL set record number dead week: 1,486! mean person worked home effectively almost 2 years, get problem is. 

Pretty much everyone NEEDs office work effectively already now. Maybe wearing masks, in. I'm never going back office. I'll go week whatever. work home continue so. work getting us back come hell high water . back 3 days week eventually even kills us. seriously wear mask times office. isn’t unvaccinated people get spread Covid delta.  car accident ever driving back work lunch. OP said 40% new cases breakthrough cases. report 600 people currently hospitalized. You’re comparing thing. This! already shortage workers tech science get worse feel full effect Trump administration’s fuckery immigration higher education. problem solved simply raising wages—-it takes many years education create Masters PhD level data scientist. 

What think see future shitty outsourcing ten twenty years ago work done low paid, poorly trained workers. lead truly remote workforce supplementing (replacing) h1B workforce company employees working remotely places like Bangalore, Bucharest, Bejing. 

This lead downward pressure wages incredible competition jobs: applied last job, competition limited people lived around 30 miles office. 10 years, may competing entire planet. Offshore resources already alter working hours match office working hours. Vermilion 😂

Yes, different political leanings family, amongst first queue get jabbed I'm grateful that. Two months ago, loved job worked 50-60 hours week.

This one wants work office yall delusional.  It’s conspiracy apparently one ok Absolutely, seeing large amount breakthrough cases deaths still seeing USA. awful 100% unvaccinated people. could pay lab? possible stage? 1. That's July. virus spread drastically since then.
2. need look hospitalizations sick kids, healthy ones. 
3. People polarized masks governors states telling people ""do whatever feel like"", going continue get worse Accidents shootings monopolize medical resources weeks months. They're contagious. same. talking donations, India China combined dont get close amount vaccines US donated.

[So far US mostly ""loaned"" actually stupid managers worry companies would fire adjust full WFH. either filter adapting technology reason might seem unessential outside looking building resources inside it. worker happiness productivity. bosses worried worried control. I've two bosses life capable, understood coordinate people, problem solvers, rest bullies. bullies want rest kids back school yard. micro-managing employees programs processes understand handing write ups little policy violations, meetings could email/text boss good for? Better hope bosses one day ask question him, he'll sit meeting Bobs explain exactly there. I’m trying say people shouldn’t get vaccinated. definitely see trend towards anti-scientific proclivities sides debate. believe following questions valid still need long term study:

* immunogenic responses LNPs potentially changing time repeated dosages?
* likelihood ribosomal production proteins *other* desired modified spike protein?
* might vaccine mRNA interact LINE-1 processes? Great thanks!! sake innovation.

Isnt unquestioning traditionalism exact opposite innovation?  he’s vaccinated allowed go vacation Take chill pill take garbage political discussion somewhere else. talking delta kids. Trump guy GOPs. Yeah she’ll end getting (she actually first person know got vaccinated - December 2020), anything she’s type person would quit job this, booster becomes mandated, even she’s skeptical (she’s **very**, *ehem*, vermillion politically) Nothing selfish type vacation. Going theme park middle pandemic children can’t still get vaccinated selfish Right, unvaccinated person sits near naturally mask desk. you, fully vaxxed mask whole day Someone tried post subreddit deleted reason:

My company best real year ever last year acknowledge productivity completely fine, even saying aware people working hours home. 

But still want everyone office bosses watch people work, weird ego trip social manipulation things person. registered nurse Stanislaus county. It’s getting worse people going around like everything normal- scoffing masks strong, uneducated opinions vaccination. Meanwhile 11 icu beds left per CA covid tracker online (as info available friday). Honestly, good. hospitality industry country thrives paying people absolutely nothing treating like garbage. one lamenting loss jobs werent even paying living wage first place. raw numbers deaths. hospital staffing capacity, now, long term debility later.. concern lot places also cutting back dramatically sorts expenses allow remote teams bond (team lunches, whether remote person, etc). company certainly has. They’ve seen benefits allowing remote work, also seen financial savings cutting kind spending pandemic, don’t understand somewhat odds long term.

Obviously, generally important things team bonding events, measurable impact team’s ability work together high stress environments without wanting kill (at least industry). Maybe vaccinated hospitals unvaccinated hospitals. unvaccinated hospitals would get clogged overrun, seems fair least people without covid best get severe covid would place treatment. Post exposure, post symptomatic. symptom rabies, vaccine damn thing you. Isn’t R95 masks (vs N95)? children can’t get vaccinated Middle management realizing won’t job can’t micromanage people know everyone wants praise WFH, think overworked micro managing middle managers terrible delegating communicating.  folks really suffering.  Thankfully office talking returning week. think coming meeting week even month makes sense anything pointless. entire job well home, need talk co workers socializing (which chat programs) im far productive home. 

Something think alot employers realize home office ill keep computer day ready go. need hop back shift help something bit extra work simple. I'll also often abit work bed prep day. huge pain come home work set computer up, log VPN, open applications etc.  Trump millitary boats come new articles report boats remained mostly empty huge waste resource that’s did? manage team 17 people real metrics. Two clearly weren’t productive working home. let go. goes. I’ve spoken boss year. salary too?  Although, last time saw article provided numbers like (it Portland) end mentioned 100% elderly.  Yeah, looking likely protection starts waning 6 months so. may seeing better protection delayed second doses months ago.  seems weird use olive oil respirator tested rated oil. school age children 12-19. places, cases still rising sharply.

No surprise really, fresh set susceptible bodies spread virus. [Delta spreads 1.8 days prior symptoms versus 0.8 previous agree saying ""jobs would outsourced way covid"" like saying automation already peaked. Weve got plenty time send jobs somewhere else. like automation going even take jobs people programing automation soon. issue work-from home crowd accept people actually like offices.

It's blind bosses insist ""office EVERYONE"" without offering anything beyond buzzwords reason.

Flexible schedules multiple work options great. Unfortunately lot dinosaurs refuse see it. mentality USA seems “if it’s happening personally, isn’t problem” fits nicely within conservative theory reluctant resistant change. exactly. execs use office camaraderie excuse don’t want remote. However, I’d much rather meaningful monthly team get together occasional companywide get together spending extra time look webcam-presentable, commute, forced coffee talk uncomfortable entire workday office temperature cold. study filtering exhalations. N95 similar, exhalations may open small gaps mask face, properly fitted mask, inhalations seal mask tighly face. Every single study shows properly fitted authentic N95s filter inhalations better 90%. Outcome based work, presence based. 

Absolutely this. organizations need get board concept. person report espouses idea super flexible us all. much care need long everything done operating smoothly. Great guy, team much better it. Dude, no. pointed smaller numbers single dose cases specifically smaller portion population. proportion matters looking top line numbers. 

And clear I’m saying, bullet wise it’s easy handle:

* old folks getting sick dying larger numbers younger folks. 
* age skew vaccination status, many, many older folks vaccinated not, many, many unvaccinated folks 50 over. 
* stat isn’t wrong, certainly vaccinated folks ICU unvaccinated. 
* conclusion based stat, vaccine efficacy severely hampered, wrong. highlighted portions refer viral load whether vaccinated individuals test positive less sick contagious. sense, right, ""slow"" spread disease. given vaccine prevent infection outright, absolutely slow community spread. study shows universal mask policy, people wore masks. It’s pretty silly study.   Good. side that: don’t want complain scrutinize bill maybe don’t charge $1500/hr. bro chill fuck out, mistake. fuck mother anything, need hostility. Canada fully vaccinated 73%, age 12 older. rate Canada 12 older least 1 dose 82%. They've done right. Oh god, think instead highlight breakthrough infections, wonder called that.

Because vaccinated people tend protected vaccine, people still get despite vaccinated called breakthrough cases.

The second link indeed stopping Delta leading hospitalization, however also contains data effective vaccine getting disease.   looking wrong way. (e.g. CDC) make policy take account people's innate, often irrational behavior, almost certainly make mistake ends making things worse. point, become, ethical sense, part problem.

I'll grant ethical line ***vary*** hard pinpoint. can't defend particulars CDC chosen share, (along rest us here) can't see bigger picture. extremes sharing information regardless context/applicability/interpretability, alternatively, sharing information, clearly problematic. act ethically CDC must walk line two points. AGAIN. READ slow spread Delta. prevent getting virus. **It prevents getting disease caused virus.** 

I'm saying vaccine reduce likelihood SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE. opposite fact. said reduce likelihood spreading virus.

Do understand problem RIGHT NOW? assume anti-vaxxers stupid (and many sure). answering problem presented. behavior recognizable. 

**If issue health, able decide get vaccine. die; right. issue dying people, matter what, seek medical care, limited resource. let's honest this.** Boss that's worried productive employee directly benefits company financially terminated immediately. 

These “Bosses” parasitic drain company resources... stockholders care price stock and/or stable dividend. achieved ROI that's directly correlated productivity individual workers. 

What Bosses really worried “The theater Management” Sure. number, India China donated date. 

Any way like measure it? talking friend refuses get vaccinated all. I'm upset think like honestly I've lost lot respect him. says business stay yes, ask, course she’s nurse.

One arguments lots doctors veterinarians it. medical qualification, mean know everything virology immunology.

Good mom getting vaccinated though, sound like completely boosters.  Women huge risk blood clots comparison men, COVID also kills clotting. respiratory disease.  Remember second third week April pictures posted globe show lockdowns? beautiful world would didn’t many people driving two three hours day sit office building. stupid, fear mongering, article Bloomberg post was...
“Vaccinated people scared without answers”
Literally stop scare tactics. rent expensive city lot people used commute like 1-2 hours way traffic get office.

talking seem much less stressed waste much day wasted stand still traffic. work company anywhere. longer stuck company it’s field area. Yeah ridiculous, like bosses could they'd two jobs worth work. Might well claim need nurses doctors technically enough knowledge lot things nurses do, except doctor can't doctor part things they'll spending 80% time nursing. chose law sucked math. oldz Thanks! super helpful comment 👍  Worst worlds! last company. Make sure tell you’re leaving work remove know impact forced office work Omg point sitting desks apart video meeting them? shit infuriating. get might distributed team members call too, would better wfh point. Also, hear other's voices echo? lol Remote supervision project management really expose poor unqualified managers. course many folks concerned. There's lot great points/facts ""Discussion"" area. 

I hope time read reply thoughts it.

One paragraph goes Second, evolutionary pressure virus determine speed resistance nAbs emerges. widely given epitope targeted biomedical intervention, effective is, rapidly generate resistance (Fig 4). know priority make sure everyone vaccinated, still case, boosters probably needed sooner later 
I wish organized method distribution.
Right seems like people need lie say get one 
I hope get better info mean... 

::gestures vaguely everything::  Save money renting office space smaller companies, higher productivity employees. Win win. Many minimum capacity rules insane. exotic location

I know code 'strip club' see it.  practically without vaccines.

Critical point mention decrease hospitalizations death %'s fully vaccinated. no, same. Before, worked hours day, 8-12 office, drive hour home, work remote more.

My work 100% deadline based. report due Wednesday takes 20 hours complete, makes difference 8 hours day Monday, Tuesday, turn lunch Wednesday, work double Sunday Monday turn Monday night.


So I'm situation I'm 99% remote, I'm working 12-20 hour days order comply manager workflows, corporate still requires I'm 9-5 M-F... Even ""off season"" needs 15-20 hours time week end working 40-60 cram Sunday Monday finish time, I'm busy work 150% pay rest week because... Reasons? Thanks vaccines though. already bad really baffles me. Except, times emergencies might glad portapotty existed. Can't say Facebore. Damn. bright side minor makes unlikely get severe case even deal. Nonetheless shitty situation in. save close $500 month add gas, parking, train costs mention 2.5 hours time. get extra sleep. There’s upside office work anymore. know thing, people literally paid go office. don’t see people giving much pushback. folks biased positive work environments always environments toxic project experience others. Doesn’t way you’ve experienced. 

I 100% understand folks, majority even, terrible work experience. I’m sharing things differently. team, it’s paying dividends. think fluent English understanding culture can’t outsourced. There’s also time zone differences matter. firm closed two six European offices made 100% WFH. office staying open, making workspaces collaborative, essentially able choose model want work we're fourth wave everyone's fully vaccinated. 

Right work 50:50, every second day office, hardware upgrades, paid firm, essentially strictly go office required-by-ISO filing work. team getting new member September, I'm genuinely thinking scaling week said filing. Interesting, Australia I’ve always seen 12 years hoof polish great nails. wonder downvotes? I'm favor masking social distancing vaccination -- I'm even homeschooling kid vaccines approved -- real scientific reasons think masking SD summer North serving \*slow down\* spread, still good thing, eventually reach infect everyone unvaccinated.

And think going 60% 65% fully vaccinated, certerus parabus, stop spread ... that's silly. Ironically, last company banned large person meetings COVID took off. several months left, office collaborating Teams 😆.

I agree whiteboard sessions though. miss actual board much (how valuable boxes arrows) somehow difficult group simultaneously *talk* Teams. Half meeting ""sorry, mean talk you, go ahead"". like comedy trope two people keep trying enter doorway time.

Multi talk person much easier. That's fair! different needs best options. Thanks. I'm going try workout plan. given people like survive this. least maybe feel better short exercise. 1) Basically 0%? No, pretty darn low. think getting COVID similar getting extra full vaccination.

2) Yes! immune response likely protect variants. variants different. Even ones people talking vaccine resistant reset things zero vaccinated previously infected individuals.

3) likely got Delta, due already vaccinated. depends live, places Delta going around, Delta get. worries far. wonder downvoted me. autoimmune disease taking medication suppresses immune system control it. primary care doctor told fine get 3rd jab. Step one: never that.

Step two: fire you, fire you, get another job. Odds give time dump you. Probably quotas building. I'm thinking going third moderna. six months since second shot. know sounds dumb, second one laid makes nervous get third. experience? worrying?

Sell buildings. Cut costs. need work need exercise. Working home almost impossible me, hate it. ritual getting ready getting gym gets zone put proper workout. Remote work permanent wife I... got new job 100% remote (and pays previous gig) switched roles within company one on-site consultant (although full time remote since start covid) perm WFH position. sometimes miss socialization aspect, neither us desire commute sit cube farms ever again. jobs involve sitting front computers realize feasible manufacturing service industry type jobs. really expect large office parks services (i.e. restaurants, etc) surround ever fully bounce back. But, that's guess. Covid comment: lot people retire Victoria. clearly glad won’t die get hospitalized probably wasn’t going anyway. we’re told probably stops “long Covid” that’s clearly case, unless decide believe anecdotal reports. knowledge, boosters haven’t modified target Delta, really, going here? It’s clear breakthrough cases aren’t rare. LOL Great article filled reason realism. required reading sub. I'm glad I'm one. Even distractions home, setup home office. one screen instead two, cannot view graphic files pdfs without LOT slowdown. tasks normally slowed this. Add number times crashes day connectivity issues home wifi I'm 50% productive home. think depends team. I’ve fortunate enough hand annual 2-3% raises get annual bonuses well. Event Covid. 

Folks really performed, I’ve gotten 3-4 promotions well. 

It’s Bullshit. It’s manager whether willing go bat you. give BS like “oh we’re really XYZ” it’s likely they’re unwilling conversation superiors.

So it’s crap. I’ve rewarded team. return reward amazing performance. It’s amazing works. leaders genuinely try it.  accelerate moving jobs seas lower wages? Dang state that? spent shit load money replicating office setup home back wouldnt ruined wish company done instead. Middle management justify job everybody home, who's going get mad take extra minute break? Well said. Thank you. Israeli data suggest Pfizer appreciate perspective attempting bring in. 

The problem comments *assuming* slacking 5 hours week occasion. 

That case. doctors appointment, family engagement, function important life. 

It's simply want work. I'm workaholic nature, company hugely helpful improving work-life balance, satisfaction, wellness.

We work live, live work. I'm loyal driven dedicated company work, also things life family. old place, told told come office could ‘collaborate’ whatnot. Problem being, COVID, told use Teams / Zoom collaborate. 

Utter horseshit, driving hour crawling traffic, risking around people, sit Teams calls people sat 20 feet me. New employer much modern recently written WFH 6,000 employee contracts. really don’t want skill set narrow to, will. pretty much lost control situation still low vaccination rate come bite ass. demographics arent exactly favor either. Pressure ownership make sure commercial real estate investment maintains value. found interesting supervisor (who another state) really tell working home not. like going office couple different reasons, nice option stay home I'm sick kid school. 

I'm sure bossmang *tried* could contact company figure I'm logged from, output even meetings (With suitable teams background) apparently obvious.

EDIT: speling hard. federal government announced unvaccinated people living Canada allowed denied access non essential businesses movie theatres, resteraunts, pubs, etc.

Link? seen mention federal employees. That's significant number. 175 people day die CHD only, taking account CV related diseases I'm sorry, US throwing tons doses week?

Are we? also assume nobody numbers.

What's really needed organizing booster visits places throwing out.

A shot costs $10-20. want build factories. Complaining limited supplies right choice. mean suppose happens people perform. Corporations aren’t charities. need talented hardworking enough stick. job coach folks failure learn. sometimes people aren’t meant work doesn’t work out. won’t let someone occupy spot team that’s making collective team progress. don’t embrace smaller pool workers hire

As they're busy making redundancies outsourcing India right appeal shareholders. point, expect glut large office suites market companies realize save overhead downsizing offices remote workers.. gives impression people? ridiculous! Consider reaching people titles similar positions applying for. Ask insights role advice better qualified. Good. companies claim want environmentally friendly, carbon neutral, safe place workers, bunch hypocrite tools. 

However, GOLDEN opportunity, now, presents effectively change *status quo* achieve goals, get cold feet wanna go back ""one trick pony show"".

The sad thing excuses: communication technologies required sweeping changes exists employees welcome change. 

But reckon managers terrified changes, since would make painfully clear (not all) ""disposable heroes"" bring zero value bottom line. hand, Corporate Real-estate lobby - many billions stake - strong let happen without fight. Yeah, board keeps calling “going back work” we’re like, no, we’ve working whole time. Eventually crew could replaced robots. lot front line work right process automated replaced robots. stands right second, stop working, crew stops working work free. 

There's 2 positions open department can't fill even well paid positions hard time getting filled now. THIS.

Also, guy kids married SAHM keep following URL bookmarked share situation I'm looking forward WFH becomes I'm sorry truth. medical professionals protecting ourselves. best protect other. best, least that's understanding. everyone best protection. avail us now. stupid. I'm tax accounting. disgusting bosses trim billables people damned well afford it. I've never seen anyone wearing mask goggles...I've seen people face shields mask - think worse mask...  understand increased productivity working home. take many breaks used feel lazy af. 

An analogy working home vs gym, go way harder gym feel like everyone watching.

I love wfh hope permanent.  started dropping Scotland eliminated Euros school year ended. started rising nationwide NPIs dropped. correlations though; idea cause. 

The UK unlike countries vaccinated almost nobody 18. gives large population group nearly 0 mortality exponential growth easily positive.  office far dark ages lmao.  could it. I’m vaccines well feeling point every person wants vaccine get it. It’s available months. Re: vaccine either works concerns doesn’t work going get Covid. Either way, needs lockdowns restrictions kind anyone. Covid exist forever need live life looks like individual decide. antibodies, that's little simplified

It's also ""good"" immunological memory is.

It's easy drawing blood someone able quantify antibodies original reason 8 hour workday adopted assumed worker 8 hours rest, 8 hours work, 8 hours themselves. commuting eats significant amount precious 8 hours oneself. original assumptions made back 30s fight 40 hour work week, time commutes likely much shorter recent days. sign free money? alternatively rent 2br place $300? ADD affects different people different ways. I'm unable hyperfocus all, unfortunately. Driving office order sit crammed tiny stalls headphones on, remoting servers nowhere physically close you--that make sense anyone?

this is/was exactly job everyone got sent home. exactly job home laptop used docked work. never support work anything person. Absolutely none work required office.

They liked us could get bothered management record. Suddenly everything email Teams, amount micromanaging managerial annoyances gone down.

I would imagine good cutting sexual harassment too? Maybe need shit countries like Romania anti-vaccination “donate” doses rich countries. 

Don’t try deflect Romania’s epic failure vaccinate people shitting others.  JHU reporting Aug 20th highest day ever cases US. I'm assuming incorrect? 
319,456 Aug 20, 2021  Same. I'm moving new org precisely arbitrary forced return office. not? Might outsource Asia outsource states cheaper standard living. Yeah guess ironically something thankful for. got bad despite vaccine real chance might killed unvaccinated state. good PPE working, necessarily social settings could exposed well  Ohmigosh, me? Got email yesterday elementary schooler's principal. exposed someone tested positive covid Friday she'll quarantined least 7 days. kids virtual last year loved back person. took six weeks one exposed school. husband told cried, simultaneously broke heart made angry anti-vaxxers. Early pandemic encountered story people took Spanish flu seriously first got fed restrictions time second wave came around formed anti mask societies everything. point knew doomed. History repeats itself. first link CDC announcement DATA also confirms said. Below, bold emphasis Fully vaccinated people Delta variant breakthrough infections spread virus others. However, vaccinated people **appear** infectious shorter period: ... contrast, **the Delta variant seems produce high amount virus unvaccinated fully vaccinated people.**

I read second link. think talking effectiveness stopping Delta leading hospitalization situation. That's point. don’t know it’s hard people understand others may nervous vaccine hiding lying things doesn’t help. doctor died vaccine it. try understand prevent. doesn’t mean vaccines worthless might forgetting kids can’t get vaxxed also like attend events.  rules would nice people don’t go Willy nilly  lock vaccines, perpetual lockdowns. I'd rather take chances catching vaccinated covid honestly restaurants hotels.

All remote work less money businesses making many cities.

They’re negotiating politicians push people back offices tax non office based workers.

Their biggest fear continues business travel stops. lot dollars. isolating still house daily? Like locked down? us back living lives since got fully vaccinated. losing time never get back. Life never 0 risk game. Chinese government's penchant propaganda well established. outbreaks also convenient way ensure get everyone vaccinated without force blatant manner. can't naive. worked hard home even took roles job description help colleagues. Management told us good job they'll keep remote work option post pandemic. 

Then pandemic hit 1 year mark, yanked us back notice said remote work anyone.

Now, bare minimum job description nothing else. help problems mine offer new ideas.

I'm still like job (the bits still bother with), like team, live close office, get practically nothing. longer true, intend leave.

If get sent home fall, due mandates (lol) whole building catching covid (more likely), work hard since already know they're going take away soon can. That's I'll really start looking fully remote options. know focus deaths/hospitalizations public health perspective big ones watch fuck whole system start snowballing mortality hospitals get overwhelmed. Also Delta severe original age groups. Children likely die, healthy young people likely die, etc. 

But worrying wish people talked healthcare world kept detailed record things unified way. frustrating many sick people, billions them, missing enormous wealth data!!! Even 'mild' means losing sense taste smell.. lot people lost sense taste smell gotten back 100% maybe never will. friggin sucks! That's like form disfigurement! people's IQ's lower recovery? sucks too! knows long long long term, like cancer something like HPV, shingles chicken pox. really need global coalition scientists working together around world advocate better data, planning, education, etc. tiny coffin companies.

Such good episode! Went undergrad watching him... terrible decision. idea difficult say shit like people? Since automod keeps removing comment I'm sure one unreliable source. Since many sources talking it. first know unpopular opinion, personally hate working home. toddler baby, make hard actually focus concentrate anything. would love opportunity go back office, even person there, get peace quiet. employer still requiring everyone work home. selfish incredibly ignorant location, population situation diving there. really checked boxes stupid one. What's Russia's deal? basically world's troll? I’m you. I’m actually gonna starting new job weeks. Coming fully remote job (even pandemic) two years office going strange. I’d lying said wasn’t bit excited go back office. live small one bedroom apartment it’s really hard separation work home life. line work remote isn’t really option time I’ve accepted that. 

Main reason leaving I’m getting nearly double current salary though. lool idk thought people vacationing universal pandemic would right thing….  Hmmm know I'm infecting Plague Inc brother works ICU central florida says patient ages skewing much younger before. main hospital serves older population others county, ""best"" (which still good). felt safe 3 times went Disneyland Resort parks pandemic. wore mask whole time indoors outdoors, avoided indoor dining, sanitized frequently, social distanced much possible, especially eating outside. wasn’t fully vaccinated time (had 0 doses first trip 1st dose 2nd 3rd trips), felt safe precautions took. again, way fewer cases Florida even Texas, since state actually cares mask mandates. California requires indoor masking masking schools, lowers case count. Even though Disneyland Walt Disney World similar COVID safety policies, look what’s happening entire region whole, since people region visit resorts bring COVID them, Florida lot worse California moment. personally would avoid Florida theme parks right since people coming us moderately high-risk severe COVID.

In year though, think Delta combined next holiday gathering/winter surge, along people heading Disney World Universal Christmas New Years going get lot people Florida sick (so get antibodies COVID) convince lot locals regular Disney World visitors voluntarily get vaccinated since want reduce chances getting sick. time summer 2022 rolls around, COVID cases probably similar California levels now, feel comfortable going level cases take precautions. get decide voting isn't. 

My comment clear context already comment read understood relation link provided. found number 73% could clearly see number fully vaccinated partially vaccinated. pointed out. Right best time make lateral move find new job. Personally, work 40 hours week anymore. won't. time important money, completely honest, good work eight hours up, working seven days week. Find something else love job get life back. There's need give time employer would drop instant felt like it. No, means exactly says. headline ""most unvaccinated New Yorkers Black"", says ""vaccination rates lowest among Black people New York"". clearly talking percentages, absolute population sizes. 
 
Also, ""exponentially"" describes rate change, make sense looking populations point time like this. 
 
Also, [law large states average result experiment converge expected value enough iterations. see relation whatsoever current conversation. Unfortunately, jobs in-person field mostly academia right now. jobs almost impossible land.

There person jobs there, lots people ""knowledge econony""...engineers, researchers, etc....if teaching, stuck home. Considering headmaster several admins friends Facebook anything probably helped. Yeah, gonna say--clients dont want pay long things *really* take, particularly research. (""You're lawyer, know already!"") Good points. agree hybrid way go now, kind liken four day work week way, work get done 5th day (while working home 1-3 days week), work done people's pace without commute, especially work individual work. Anyone gotten moderna booster yet? I’m 6 months 2nd dose …  Anything related innovation sounds like challenge remotely. Sometimes need in-person whiteboarding sessions.

But industries SOPs already exist, everyone knows role, work routine repetitive. jobs much better fit WFH. 

I see hybrid future well. Humans social creatures, us crave form return office. know government agency work mandated return date 1/1/22 see. He’s everything right. Getting vaccinated, wearing mask. everyone else thing, would probably fine. People spread text messages well. hear people Asian communities complain parents getting educated University WeChat. feel sorry FB case. reason getting blame popularity platform makes easy see misinformation spread here. know people's private group chats families. think trying take better precaution misinformation, tough battle.

Any engine brings people closer together run similar issues well. Twitter misinformation too, FB group generally older people. context today see bad, there's lot good social media bring well. personal thing healthy unhealthy relationship anti vaxxers might waste bet would awesome people always tell busy. ones said waiting FDA approval. set fools up! (I'm kidding, mostly) That's hospitalizations ONLY. virus attacks every major organ system ACE2 receptor: top head. Even get sick point requiring care, long term effects feel. That's question we're starting see trends (links embedded above). Spoiler alert good. Long term decreased cognitive ability, lung function. 40-50 years heart's look like, kidney's? can't find nephrologist now, imagine boom bubble hits, imagine cost dialysis they'll face 60-70;s onward. societal perspective we're going pay that, dead.  


What I'm saying is: believing experts really care kids. fine ask questions. matter, navigate this, understand? get frequently undergrads. However, please stop thinking bachelors biology facebook/google engenders body knowledge Ph.D. STEM M.D., challenge body knowledge contribute meaningfully scientific conversation.  like answer, file hurt feelings report go back school undegrad 12 years M.S., Ph.D. + post doc M.D. plus residency... both. comments science. Neither yours. 

My comment read understood relation link provided. found number 73% could clearl see number fully vaccinated partially vaccinated. pointed out. 

This make OP's number 83% ""of adults"" comparable nations otherwise difficult compare different nations use metric. another lawyer, similar results. WFH incredibly efficient siloed profession ours. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  people unable put two two together? Like boggles mind! Forget dying COVID even long term complications, better hope right don’t need hospital ANYTHING could end seen floor, need surgery whatever, you’re SOL. get hit drunk driver, oh well, hopefully hospital beds you. people shortsighted! Depends Industry. read links get numbers. I've labeled relevant links 1 data I'm Florida. 72 cases bathroom Sizzler. 


And sure, vaccination rate abysmal 50% fully vaccinated. ain't great though. anti-masker moron parents disrupting school board meetings throw tantrums little Johnny Suzie slap paper faces. goes well Governor threatening communities school employees withheld salaries funding dare try protect students staff. think they're pretending outbreak? They're really outbreak make one thin air? For... positive PR? big difference working people different zip codes working people different time zones. expect companies going get less less willing pay remote workers enough cover rent expensive cities offices now, think early predict exactly shake out.   understanding severely flawed then.

A mutation happen time virus replicates. matter vaxxed not. covid infection, patient zero mutation.

The reason breakthrough cases vaxxed concern clearly covid got strong enough overcome antibodies vaccine. way bugs become resistant antiobiotics time. Yes, that’s conservatives people like Trump leaders vast majority people **who politcizing situation**. Pointing acting like braindead fucking assholes attempt stop politicization creating. Employers / Bosses think different. guys live office control.  

We promote worst talent best want control, pay increase worth it. best employees focused good job, really care controlling people. exception people like 10 kids home. I've round worm infection.  Never again. Kill fuckers. shutdowns New York made clear actually essential economy. problematic matter are.

I'm excited day 75% people get work remotely permanently 25% constantly ""internet issues"" going told come in. question inherently leading intellectually dishonest. People also waiting weeks nearly two years Voting mechanisms reddit clarity adding conversation, popularity. may way they're used fun subs, political subs, science health sub, voting often clarity. could, I'd never go back office. Sell building cut cost. I'll keep eating slight increase utility costs pay gas, parking, reduced stress commuting office. wake login. I'm pro-WFH, get points. Indeed, they're reasons return office. missed those. 

But work, cons Work Office outweigh pros. I've many days get job done, damn phone stop ringing (when WFH, everyone grandparents sent email could react convenient time). feel even worse, everyone calling check really there.   website called 'smh'.

Pretty much I'm reading atrocious shit.

There must way spare pups.

Shit like makes heart hurt.  There’s still drama amongst colleagues play WFH, can’t stand. People seem lot territorial work don’t want share anything (even you’re backup) they’re even worried job security ran local school nurse walk straight told us bother sending kid Pre-K. predicting they'll rolling quarantines almost immediately. respectfully disagree. think competent managers demand ever. want grow retain employee base, need managers still able connect &amp; oversee remote workforce, becomes larger challenge. Substantially lower point cases last wave. wave also happening virtually restrictions still bad last wave full lock case hospitalizations/death ratio higher too. feel like isn’t talked enough post-vaccination waves. 

We still need vigilant forms mitigation, vaccines working. can’t find anything long vaccine last. outlast immune system? knock ARIMA model hour versus 8? Great, tell Zelda Ocarina is. bad thing? even said, liked work, would never want holiday, would rather liked. Screw bad bosses. mean like ones execs already take every year lol

Edited add: would also really love option work originally wanted us rotating schedule, like work every day office. came come back full time.

Then February(live houston big freeze), office got destroyed due busted pipes. Worked home month half straight great. Well, management came back said, got get people back offices. real explanation, whatever.

I think finish job, cares? say got time work home, would need make home setup stable. kind jumbled mess, basically need bigger computer desk house multiple monitors. Yeah true, probably need wear one every day, higher risk situations. sure masks got real? $20 50 sounds little good true honestly. real I'll definitely get though. thought that, would said numbers skewed. would said impossible since follow CDC guidance 100% vaccinated testing positive would symptoms.

The fact is, CDC guidance keep asymptomatic people getting tested. Especially since CDC also telling people vaccinated probably get infected. get tested can't get infected? Yep. end day, thing matters getting work done not. work team 8 people spread across 4 US cities working people around globe, seems wasteful drive office sit MS Teams meetings. 🤷🏼‍♂️ blame extroverts, like telling management cheap--er, whoops, ""collaborative"".  Outside work, especially ""introverted"", sing play band instance. work though want quiet privacy I'm database admin dev.

What's funny watch first Matrix movie ""oppressive"" cube farm think ""man, MUCH better tiny stalls have!"" middle row might able reach literally touch 3-5 people (longer armed folks could touch sitting behind them).  Essentially seen call center, that, though least go high enough staring someone four feet front (they there, hear possibly smell them, can't see them.) loud horrible.

I definitely vouch young kids thing. Years back contracting home oldest 2 years old--it nightmare. managers - without constant supervision, pizza Fridays, long meandering in-person meetings claim credit running everything? retrofit ice cream trucks food trucks mobile vaccination clinics.

The retrofitted ice cream trucks could play calliope version 'Hit Best Shot' cruise neighborhood. give ice cream, not? One cost saving measures outsourcing eliminate expensive office spaces. Many people test positive covid vaccine. people contact child child gets covid. Unfortunately stayed away makes sense recommend based science whatever makes people less angry reality Browse comments section sub find plenty people still parroting line ""masks protect people wearer"". part narrative everyone wear masks one protected. silly people still seem think way, least pretend to. Lol person responded straight saying 'I want people forced back office benefit' theyre one needs chill?

Or maybe youre telling chill douchebags like pretty much contemporary criteria 'good manager'  Counterpoint well taken. suppose end day depends individual whether actually enjoy office environment. Personally miss physical company coworkers, also see value remote work sides. Sorry loss. sounds like may horrific outcome many face. (lack blood oxygen, organ failure). 

I lost good friend last year COVID well, sudden unexpected due blood clot.

This disease horrible Plenty countries south eastern Europe cold chains. Enough shitty excuses. I've also enjoyed social aspect work many people want stay office good, many there's one left, seems like expecting lot people put lot trouble held captive social experience really care about. that's way they'd prefer it, really value exchanges/relationships? ...how supposed pay attention meetings constantly worried responding immediately pings chat? kinds ""managers"" need actual work do. work affected want back office? even save money getting renting offices!  Nah, threat heads 20 years now. got laid first corporate job due outsourcing 2001. months later, protecting company tried hire old job higher salary (I said non-compete agreement severance). found another job anyway.  still fence current versions covid seem affect kids bad (e.g. low hospitalisation rate).
That combine unknown duration immunity people risk hospitalisation fully vaccinated would seem enough ensure safety population.
If parents want vaccinate kids would it.

At point, think need time understand duration immunisation make call.

The flu vaccine recommended kids however mandatory school attendance. 
People higher risk strongly recommended get annual flu boosters. 

Therefore, see mandatory kids (with three current data) think everyone 18+ vaccinated covid much dangerous flu. No, Florida 60% partially vaccinated. 50% fully vaccinated. know Delta, REALLY need fully vaxxed. Especially Florida large elderly population. wish boss 😔 amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

""The Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic: Dangerous Phase Pandemic""

It's informative Grand Rounds Dr. Poland, director Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group.


Following summary courtesy Dr. JP Santiago:

1/ given nation world pandemic. Human behavior remains biggest concern pandemic. one every 512 Americans died COVID. Exponential spread Delta variant continuing unabated due behavioral factors. behavior costing us battle pandemic. get worse.

2/ ""WE GET HERD IMMUNITY.""

3/ ""WE PREVENT EMERGENCE VARIANTS.""

4/ previous vaccine studied degree scrutinized degree prior release COVID vaccines. risks benefits vaccination clear heavily favor benefits based millions millions doses administered worldwide.

5/ Overall, unvaccinated, 3X greater chance getting infected someone vaccinated. unvaccinated, 8X greater chance symptoms someone vaccinated. unvaccinated, hae 25X greater chance hospitalized COVID someone vaccinated.

6/ Delta variant, COVID unvaccinated, 2.34X greater chance getting reinfected symptoms may worse.

7/ Kids infected Delta variant get sick quickly. Data Canada shows kids infected Delta 2.75X risk hospitalization compared infected virus last year.

8/ time diagnosis, vaccinated unvaccinated VIRAL LOADS. must mask even vaccinated. vaccinated, viral loads drop faster immune system kicks in. Delta variant causes viral loads 1000 1200X higher last year's virus.

9/ “We huge experiment youth. taking contagious viral variant, letting use masks crowding together see happens.”

“Not one single expert thinks good idea.”

While benefits in-person learning, take place two simple measures- vaccinate teachers staff mandate masks.

10/ good data UK shows 9X increase infection transmission school age children Delta variant compared last year's virus.

11/ medications widespread use today far fewer study participants part approval process COVID vaccines. Full approval coming soon, change vaccine-hesitant behaviors.

12/ mutation rate virus inversely proportional vaccination rate. vaccinate, less likely new variants. people vaccinate, get variants variants need vaccination mandates.

13/ pandemic end given way American public behaving. verge emergence variant set us back square one again.

14/ yet know level antibodies protective. call ""correlates protection"". starting get early data this, emergence variants set us back determining correlates protection.

15/ incubation period infectious diseases long enough spool activate long term immunity. original SARS-CoV-2 virus extent Alpha variant long enough incubation period (7-10 days exposure development symptoms) allow long term immunity activated. Delta variant much shorter incubation period (only 3 days, 4 days max exposure development symptoms) high viral loads may overwhelming activation long term immunity.

16/ prior warnings coronaviruses SARS 2003 MERS 2012. future coronaviruses constitute threat us. Yes, temporary losses civil liberties. biggest loss recent history.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Huh? lot organizations either shed leases looking so. would home furnishings cause pollution commuting? get feeling work extroverts hate WFH themselves, also introverts. Like good enough surrounded extroverts. sad health officials need warn people bad idea. time alive Managin jira tickets ;)

All jokes aside, I’m mostly manage cross team deadlines/relationships, manage careers ( want go ladder, expect/need someone higher eng rank give least monthly feedback ). help getting prioritization internal clients, splitting tasks team etc. also double tech director team 20 people someone keep big picture mind (ie make sure we’re align firm direction long term problematic design ;) )

Oh take care paperwork, lots lots lots pf compliance paperwork. part fucking hate. whish would hire someone extremely technical dont pawn one guys. Maybe help teach personal responsibility. Keep butt home jail! 1st came USA, hard get one people waiting hours hours cars long lines turned away ran out. People forget happen. really 4 million? haven’t paying attention numbers, holy crap. lot Yes, WFH great know everyone relationship them. new hires, different get feel company culture. 

Flexibility key. pandemic over, I'll go office two three times week max. 

I miss going lunch dropping colleagues chat. lived Turlock, Ceres Oakdale 90s and, even though living Texas past 25 years, comment surprise all. office started looking re-leasing space within maybe 2-3 months WFH starting. Offered people ability WFH full time, part time, all, re-arranged floorplans squeeze new in-person projections small space possible, rest could leased out. countries greater need, money. handling fine negotiated lower price slower delivery. Vaccination border workers started March. vaccines came priority groups invited supplies arrived. also sent vaccines islands Pacific - Rarotonga etc even small outbreak would collapse health system. incorrect. Multiple Australian states eliminated delta outbreaks.

The secret stall spread lockdown isolate contacts. I'd wager lot people remember polio going fuck around. build relationships virtually using Teams, requires little creativity. One offices on-camera cook-off, member making different dish sharing photo team members. One favorite events scavenger hunt everyone competed find common objects house, snap photo beat deadline. also make point reaching people chat (when they're slammed). quick Teams call like poking head someone's office saying ""How mother doing? know feeling well last week."" [you mean like  company sold physical offices. They're committed permenate remote work. think new companies bother old companies cling empty real estate wasting money. wife spends previous commuter time working. drives nuts. saving ton money gas, tolls, Metra tickets, etc. Childrens capacity? scary. People applying getting hired.  USA wasn't. read article? Nothing says unemployed don’t “believe in”covid.  number children hospitalized US COVID 1 month places even started school. It’s high number understand high number need look pediatric hospitals full country. lot us don’t frame magnitude numbers really mean. Like, actually know hospitalization rate per 100k kids per month bad? cut would say “worrisome”? lay person sure hell don’t know. know though easy see impact hospitalization rate currently experiencing, full pediatric hospitals. means places sick kids handle scary big deal. team activities.

Please this. Lots people hate secretly. I’d want change “Are bathroom?” Fucking plague spreaders. attorney that's charging $1500/hr see value time expertise, probably dealing issue could handled non-partner top law firm. deal lot attorneys partner work absolutely worth $1400/hr rate charges, question time invoices. But, take every legal issue him, staff handle contracts issues. heard data coming hospitals health departments wasn’t standardized reliable. heard months ago.   returning back low single digits likely fantasy point. 

This correct. NZ every chance squashing outbreak - various Australian states killed delta outbreaks past, NZ comprehensive lockdown. seeing moment NZ contact tracers mapping initial outbreak. key metric number non-household transmission events post lockdown - moment, unknown. School starting now, delta variant infectious. Also, kids can't vaccinated. exit interview? me: coworkers friends.

That's incredibly bad take. large part professional work getting know colleagues, people often form friendships people work with. job tasks do, lot work relationship-building, that's true even lowest-level employee.

Your attitude may really limit professional development. You’d right vaccines weren’t available anybody wants one think it’s voice. I’m afraid I’m going leave accident broadcast porcelain weather. group meeting virtual? work remotely I'm moving farther city live lifestyle dream still employed field. I'm driving 2hrs way team meeting. Conservatives backed corner constant state Cognitive Dissonance. boss worried, dumbass. Snap realize clinging old patterns thought work done. bosses skill set determine really working not. Usually ones insist workers cubicles close office possible ""see"" who's working.

I always thought ""VIP coming tomorrow"" thing funny worked. sure desk - clean everything (like work) looks neat. Companies don’t embrace smaller pool workers hire  What's ""senior leader""? Honest question. Edit: need you?  powerful corrupt want people misinformed stupid Idk eat office. money save gas goes enjoying outside house since work now. would want leave house weekends. Children far less likely need hospitalization anything. That's many resources increases swamp hospitals swamped Covid patients — may get sick Covid filling children's hospitals areas seeing Macon children’s hospital: ‘We’re full’ Never want go back. wife baby I've gotten see daughter everyday since day 1 still work. benefit two parents home us continue work. I've gotten better job working home I've able actually enjoy weekends breaks lunches laundry, clean, tasks around house. 

Plus office sucks, cold ass ac, recirculated air, fluorescent lighting, spending time people honestly feel close relationship to. 

Oh driving equals less pollution. ""We need make sure wearing pants."" yup, agree you. lot people would prefer going office, commute time acceptable. issues come time loss due commute IMHO. 
And estimated people WFH wasting way time perceive. (probably 50% talking about). personally know prefer structure, helps separate work life. Victoria screwed next NSW border that's clearly able guarded tightly enough prevent entries. getting mystery cases know slipping border. NZ able totall control borders puts different category comes stopping outbreaks. Said boss got life. people know management also enjoy working home life-work balance came essentially rationalising CDC spreading disinformation bc benefits end goals. article couple weeks ago children's hospital South (I can't remember where) -- medical director said kids used come complaints often would happen test positive COVID well. they're seeing *many* kids present COVID symptoms primary complaint. military told. don’t join military independent thinker. Finally statement makes sense long term. Trump one rallies told crowd get vaccine -- got booed.

Trump himself, godking lot Republican voters, booed supporting vaccine. That's today. know conventional widely parroted counter argument. However, fact remains US media overwhelmingly shaming one demographic low vaccination rates, completely soft pedaling another demographic low vaccination rates.

At least, bad look. Even 100% usa vaccination would still happen countries still spawn variants Indeed. part forget. Per capita case isn’t BEST stat use, countries donate to, becomes significantly tricker expensive. US donated lot countries, places donated dozen less. capacity cons’ ability accept lies lie knows bounds. I'm begging, begging you

not take dewormer, baby way tell Delta?

I covid want know delta. wasn’t eligible Pfizer. yeah definitely normal winter lockdown going rough. manager management must understand going forward, *this way* Reddit, users mostly anonymous approach strangers strangers, without undue trust. merely voices others' heads, whispers electrons/photons lost endless series tubes. Easy ignore, be.

On FB, crap comes someone know/trust (or entire social circle). dangers trust abused, conforming fear excluded much higher. world still supply issues, dude. kids 

Lol, seen death stats kids? It’s almost non existent.

I’m preaching COVID caution purely false. Reasonable not, want stop next delta, donating necessary similar. We’ve closed roughly 23% tickets per month home, open times 27% less. couple hundred million people vaccinated recent studies put effectiveness infection delta around 50%. better keeping people dying ending ICU, great infection anymore. Independent Grocers Alliance Football started stadiums full unmasked fans. 

It’s outside… people screaming 2 hours. Quick question informed. reporting actually giving percentage infected vaccinated vaccinated people Vs percentage infected non-vaccinated non-vaccinated people. would probably give us better idea effectiveness. Else using everyone denominator (vaccinated unvaccinated) results always skew towards majority unvaccinated right? Example, 20 unvaccinated 10 vaccinated. 10 unvaccinated got sick would mean 50% unvaccinated got infected. 5 vaccinated got sick, that’s also 50% vaccinated. Else 5/25 makes number look smaller it’s correctly calculating denominator math requires really focusing control group. Maybe reporting done right I’m wondering is?  estimated sequence every case determine exact lineage.  cat needed eye drops. husband later got exact ones eye doctor, Vet $35, eye Dr $175. vet smarter Dr ever met. figure problems patient can't tell symptoms &amp; animals get everything human can.  taken cases seen twice 20 yrs &amp; nails it.  I've also met vet dull dishwater &amp; taking care houseplants let alone animals. took 10 Dr &amp; 18 months husband's cancer diagnosed. Drs always smart hope either. great Vet better 100 mediocre Drs. lawyer, real metrics much efficient home versus work, track hours 6 minute intervals (a “0.1”). 

In 2020 billed hours life, exceeding annual target 15%. back office track 5% target, large part due awkwardness dealing Covid workplace. So, appears 20% efficient working home. true. outdoor events seem less impact spread. 100% FAR better inside. Especially lot vaccinated people people chose wear masks. talking donations, India China combined dont get close amount vaccines US donated.

If talking SELLING yes, India China sold lot vaccines US think difference breathing 10k viral particles breathing 1k, 5k, even 9k, would suggest research see viruses work. Exponential growth doubles speed every step past 1. fact we're seeing breakthrough cases blessing.

We're seeing breakthrough cases [the CDC stopped tracking Sheltering place spectrum, though, situation fluid time. personally fine sheltering place years massive introvert (and acknowledge everyone feels way). Even stopped sanitizing groceries refusing go stores reduction quality life high me. going go bunch crowded indoor bars party? Fuck no. willing two hour dinner unmasked small table outside? Fuck no. go 20 minute walks outdoors friends week, everyone wearing well-sealing N95 masks? Yes. willing forever avoid 20% debilitating long covid (the worst case scenario)? Yes. think come this? -- think pandemic last forever many reasons.

But even did, world would convince yolo indoor bar/nightclub/frat party ever worst case scenario spectre 20% long covid + Delta + current vaccine efficacy. Biontech produces twice many doses Pfizer (2bn vs 1bn).

Everything said wrong, keep going.

Do remember ""America first""? countries remeber. know cousin? Even countries harsh border controls contact tracing measures (like Vietnam) suffering badly. Zero COVID getting unrealistic local well global goal. Indeed. low levels, effective contact tracing. enough people infected, contact tracing becomes hopeless move towards general lockdowns. ""A stitch time saves nine."" Half Moderna dose probably perfect booster. Hope data soon. seems likely Delta outbreak straw breaks camel's back. R0 far high, probably already hundreds infected. truly shutdown country like, three weeks, maybe, likely, low percentage population vaccinated, spread like wildfire.

I hope I'm proven wrong, btw, way everywhere else Delta gains little foothold. gonna OK man.  style guides say titles don’t capitalize conjunctions (like ‘and’), articles (like ‘the’), prepositions (like ‘to’) unless first word title. 

Not trying stickler know anything. recently helped teenager learn odd bits writing term paper documenting references etc. know popular sentiment, US waste millions it’s donations one hundred million.. Well done Spain! I’m thinking also effect COVID peoples lives moment.

I live Ontario, Canada. Toronto surrounding area, lockdown March June, November June. (Some things open slightly February, really malls 15% capacity IIRC). mass disruptions peoples lives across country (curfews Quebec, lockdowns many provinces, travel restrictions Atlantic provinces), think people much reason get go get vaccinated way restrictions lifted. lockdowns restrictions (that strict almost everywhere US) basically acting ‘stick’ get shots arms.

In US, yes conspiracy theorists drive lot hesitancy, people didn’t care get vaccinated either caught COVID didn’t view threat them, already lives back. could go eat, could see friends, could go mall, etc. Especially since, time (and well) told people still mask up, nothing really would changed post-vaccination.

I would imagine country like New Zealand, basically living like it’s 2019 within borders, many people wouldn’t really care get go get shots COVID wasn’t really something impacting daily lives.

I guess I’m trying say is, something seriously impeding daily life, social life, livelihood, you’re much likely set aside laziness hesitancy get vaccine. that’s factor, “carrot” isn’t really appealing. got cancer tumor needed removed, would rather team veterinarians perform surgery you? Get that's literally opinion crazy person. Specialists spend years studying specific part human body, would rather animal doctor diagnose you. necessarily. mRNA vaccines induce muscle (and probably cells) produce modified version spike protein (and hopefully unknown versions protein… that’s whole concern). cells presented info produce antibodies decline time. 

The concerning thing situations, low levels antibodies relative exposure load actually theoretically increase virulence antibodies present attach virus, fail kill it, make easier virus interface cells.

Nobody really knows vaccinated people going react go farther time post vaccination. We’re totally uncharted waters. use keep touch old friends family members parts country. There's also fun groups movie, TV shows, Gen X, Houston History like. use news political issues. ThAt'S DiScRiMiNaTiOn...

Seriously, that's guvnah AZ said... Schools area nurses decades. long been? would wait. clinic, we’re approved give 3rd dose immune compromised patients, organ transplant recipients, active chemo patients, etc.

Diabetes immune-compromising condition *per se* get mean. likely won’t wait long anyway (they’re eyeing mid-September moment) Also maybe cut avocado toast! Yep, exactly recommended received Pfizer vaccine. Florida's RT spread rate 1.0 (at 0.86 right now,) reflecting epidemic contracting. Day day cases every age category, EXCEPT, school age children 12-19. places, cases still rising sharply. older family uses time. entire group crosses political spectrum, mask mask, vaccine vaccine, educated uneducated. use facebook. easily less productive office. It’s lack trying either. 

The chatty people office really take bite in-office work day. much so, choose days in-office based whether chatty person day.  Well, started going back office six weeks ago, basically full time past three weeks, due critical staff member let go. soon get replacement running, going go back nearly full time WFH. informing employer this, asking. yeah, I'm willing back two-week notice. 

There's many reasons, Delta first one, course, also, although may seem contradictory, imposition indoor mask mandate state (rather stay home alone walk around giant piece cloth plastered face). There's fact downtown area almost entirely deserted except homeless, addicts mentally ill, feel safe even walking bus stop. there's - peace I'd gained working home 16 months, bad habits I'd shed (among things, drink months started back office I""m regularly consuming least couple bottles wine week), reliably good sleep, feeling centered present life - every bit gone, weeks back I'm burned fear would take three month vacation get back start summer.

Employers absolutely clueless toll office life takes every aspect existence. surprised people want go back way things were, way things something never tolerated first place. around 15% people 60 unvaccinated Florida. unleash covid population, get situation seeing Florida. op, distractions home. Many people separate office /workspace. Kids/spouse, pets hard work around. Let ask you, work hours? mean trouble focusing still working try speed later make it? find billable time difficult I'll feel guilty slacking realize fuck company probably still get done whole day even took two hours off.  Say 100 people infected 70 vaccinated 30 vaccinated, much protection vaccine provide? Well, impossible answer information would need know number people exposed vaccination status. 

A crude way look total number vaccinated community, eg: 700 people vaccinated 3000 people vaccinated, there's 10% chance infection unvaccinated 1% chance vaccinated, meaning vaccination 90% effective.

However, know vaccinated unvaccinated population different, vaccinated people likely older, working essential jobs etc. due vaccine rolled out.

A better way via case control, take positive case bucket age/gender/occupation etc. estimate percentage cohort vaccinated derive effectiveness estimate way. username assume spend much time Reddit.  Social pressure mostly. Also job particularly love, pays well enough. This! cut one group workers without, managers nothing boss others around look/feel big! botanist eventually go back labs horticulturalists well office staff work anyplace! Work places flexible listen employees. days dictating working conditions work majority workers over. said anything nothing? BS like kids staying home another year. school nurse, point I’d put sign closed door office reads, “If sick, go call parents don’t come back you’re well. bandaids ice packs, monoclonal antibodies.” one thread I've seen, someone said zero. true, think event big success showing return normal. Covid probably never dealt it, go, ACTUALLY look like flu (fingers crossed)  summer numbers. That's point article. schools open kids crowded together indoors, numbers increase.

I'm sure precautions would actually effective, remote schooling. Delta spreads like chicken pox. 73% entire population 1 jab.  Oregon least hospital beds per capita US. admit past years depressing, definitely last year closed doors friends me. everyone loser except you. ironically 😉.  exactly *any* skills. people believe anything... bleach inject prevent COVID mean tested virus, would show positive vaccinated? People always adapting ""new normal"". took us something like 12 months adapt new normal working home demanding standard labor condition.

Remember post-World War II, used reasonable expectation defined benefits pension, job security, good health coverage, paid time off, many union initiated job protections spread societywide. new normal self-funded 401(k)s, lucky job, medical care drive bankruptcy.

So going back office? Sure. Give 5 years maybe 8 nudges drive us back two years ago. Long commutes, office space, putting body present time rather getting work done. order comparatively small need front queue. said before, ordered vaccines changed tack. 

 ability see results rollout hotspot countries committing strategy also.

Some countries needed us even threating stop vaccines shipped us Australia.

 vaccines go internal testing medsafe process approved use also. It’s also extremely rare. B...but justify need exist can't take boardroom pointless meetings spelled via email person team calls MS Teams could handle reason roam halls chit chat managers shit Becky's hair today Becky office harass?

*Seriously, fuck office*   De worms crawl in, de worms crawl out

The ones go lean thin.

The ones come fat stout. Great point!! hope true. so, I'm happy you! Agreed. brother’s church lost lot leadership callous even defiant attitude toward masks. several others attend new church that’s mask friendly. idea is? I've heard several people say I'm curious. lucky got ""mild"" symptoms (it still worst virosis ever had, got weeks eligible vaccine, especially infuriating). aunt hospitals three months, OK now. vulnerable relatives got vaccinated time, avoided deaths family. quite people meant lot died it.

So understand anger share it. lot people died idiots succumbed propaganda. way. neither fault stupid, bombarded ""flatten curve"", ""herd immunity"", ""no worse flu"" rest murderous propaganda since day one. spring nowhere, promoted likes Cato institute new generation ""epidemiologists"" never saw patient lives, embraced politicians governments share ideology.

They neither made picked Facebook originally. told people positions authority there's reason worry virus, actually worry consequences trying stop virus. junk science posts Facebook convince conspiracy afoot. ""look Sweden, limitations they're alright"", ""but depressed kids losing childhood"", ""people dying *with* Covid"", etc. etc. mainstream talking points pushed governments mainstream media. many stupid people? Maybe Corona thin herd raise average iq Lawyers consultants also lie billables overbill. Work home large company short "" someone another country job soon"" Really bold assumption people Florida would care safety, own. problem even US many unvaccinated people, hospitals collapsing unvaccinated people. Might military.lots maneuver going lately  think Israel European countries got wrong 5 month timing shot 3? Feels like 8 month timing US based logistics science. kind idiot would pay fake test results instead getting free test free vaccine? That's forced employees back, upper management employees chose person vocally complained missed people office, often loudest person voices ones weight.  go back heartbeat sucks hometown then, mean vet specialists like doctor specialists. hometown vet able go zoo take care everything there. fear needle pain, idea skin pierced squicks end. reason I'm afraid wasps, spiders, snakes, etc.  rational fear, still fear it.

Totally vaxxed though! Well, countries like US, regardless world deadly virus circulating widely “normal” matter much people away eating TGI Fridays. go Google ""NC covid cases""
Replace nc state/country I've fond memories lot friends New Zealand. I'm hoping dodge bullet. Vaccines 99% effective severe illness. We’re going lock years prevent people getting colds. problem socialiazing important part makes us humans. get socialize people outside work environment, I'm afraid people close outside world. also painfull sometimes sound, hearing different opinions things work related important development. drawbacks problems related WFH. problem people isolating tedencies. job opposite. get wrong, love boats, I've never seen appeal cruises. Myocarditis news rumbling mRNA vaccines quite bit. 27 (and I'm assuming male) second highest risk group myocarditis mRNA. Still likely, common far side effects go (1/5000 - 1/15000). I'm similar range though reaction, hope solve issue next round. understand myocarditis actually pretty common athletes, good shape deterrent there.

Nice! wish health system guys do. I'm hook thousand dollars something like happens (and ""good"" health plan!) US budget happening every years. Naive assume US - sorry that!

They say non-typical reaction mRNA vaccine get another dose, doctors decide whether that's relevant anymore. Sorry go this.  thing is, Romania currently 500 cases day per 20M population. 

That's like US 7500 cases day US like 150K cases day... 

Don't know Romania able keep cases low low vaccination rate  sister passes needles still got shots…it’s excuse everyone needs part. Realistically means Office Hotelling office works like shared workspace taking bookings. Teams try coordinate come day F2F meetups. mean move flexible spaces offices massive downsizing. words, commercial property shit investment.

The flip side lot people want larger homes. two persons household work, need workspace. true work. We're losing people right left trouble recruiting senior leadership allow us offer flexibility anymore.  13% excess deaths percentage people would travel several hours way 2 times past 8 months US astronomically low. 

There's also Rural Health Clinic Covid Vaccine Distribution Program help address issue. 

Not mention least 9000 (just walgreens alone) spread across 50 states.  like flexibility choose. many days home start feeling isolated, many days office want fucking break coworkers. stuff easier person, things easier home. 

I sort come go like cat, things run pretty smoothly also allow team same. Like say, 'All Nothing'. Reducing East Coast itinerary Disney, local trips region greatly reduces risk maximizes benefit. I'd love visit rugged sea coast Rain Forest Pacific Northwest day. would top list ever make there. many people got vaccine, wouldn’t gotten vaccine Trump won? told last year couldn’t trust Trump lost?  seems really low SE numbers changing due Delta. breakthroughs reinfections going up. reinfections 2x likely breakthroughs. 

The numbers studies. 

I'm going quote numbers you. Amen!!!!!! Neither discipline boundaries gonna good douchebag manager thinks offload much work want. gotta delusional think companies gonna try ""optimize"" process favour.   hospitals full, IFR goes dramatically. Using last year’s covid IFR assumes functioning health care system really really dumb. point, IFR approach Indonesia’s delta surge. bonafidemasks.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Enough time passed enough people vaccinated us spotted indications potential long-term problems.

This Worrying unknown long-term side effects covid vaccine lot like worrying whether enough gas make destination car fire.

Depending old are, would agree. entirely depends age risk idiotic concerned unknown long-term health issues covid vaccine, worried known unknown long-term health issues covid itself. 

You’re assuming much here. believe cause concern situations, agree known risks COVID absolutely merit vaccines. Keep mind nothing wrong holding position also questioning details relatively under-researched mRNA techniques mass application vaccines.

Again, depends age risk profile. example, think potential risks vaccine, any, could possibility outweigh risks virus people age 18. don’t know enough yet.  Sorry Idk means…. CDC AMPLE evidence removing mask mandates bad idea. Science revises itself, society doesn’t. known mask recommendation removed, way hell ever going come back. 

What got bunch unmasked people running around time far viral variant. good luck enforcing compliance again, ever. tracker?

I know NC takes patients states, since really good hospital system here. I’ve heard Duke pretty much full right now. 

I’ve heard lots helicopters heading UNC week, also. data sourcing? gas station street literally begging people offering bonuses start. service industry. would curious getting hired data coming from. it’s lack interest testing treatments. countries actively treating Covid, vaccinating. know vaccines can’t completely prevent Covid, looking study potential treatments? germany least, work supply come employer.

home office bew niche course, generally rules hold true except workspace, one provide (which kinda point).  former employer wanted everyone back office come Aug. 12. 3/4 department since left jobs (including myself) better opportunities.

Return office may entire reason people left, undeniably huge part it. Usually don’t trust teams ones likely fit category stating. They’re best leaders. NEED trust folks team execute, else heck hire team?

I’ll never understand leader micromanages. instances there’s performance improvement needed someone struggling, potential don’t think micromanaging coaching place successful. letting fly. it’s Mississippi I’m sure won’t selectively enforced target minorities something. Yeah that’s hated whole “people want get back work!” narrative lockdown. No, want money support families.  90% Canada's population vaccinated, even Delta raging parts world, make dent Canada? weeks ago drove private parking lot near train station used full capacity workday. maybe 1/3 full. Whoever owns lot must hurting. Helllllllp home office chairs causing 90x pollution office office chairs!  issue going full remote managers actually necessary role company. Turns incentivize people jobs constantly someone looking shoulder see actually working. really poor use data. Patients / number kids existence? People suffer domestic abuse place go aren’t super thrilled though. They're saying effective, 100%. going guarantee 100% safety, never has. mean outright effective provide substantial protection. curious, media going say us next kids get vaccinated order covid “continue”? I’m going laugh say need third shot considered “fully vaccinated” fourth fifth.   hand, young future-looking entrepeneurs able find good staff workexperience probably willing take paycut means home office option. spouse kids persuasive.

Kind weird cause distractions Florida: ""These official undercounts gave you"" Here’s idea: work home convert giant office buildings housing? Indeed. team consists 20 people spread world. HQ Northern California. super effective. also don’t think us ever met person. 100% agree long covid well flu nowhere near bad covid. Long covid mainly got two doses.

As ICU cases States, take whatever reported American media moderation. Media loves sell fear. high number unvaccinated adults would logically mean high number children ICU logical even lower chances developing severe cases. Also, less children ICU also take early indications grain salt. would like information mandating next generation vaccinated vaccine know long term effects. appreciate phizer taking time testing phase. 


Anyways, say appreciate discord intrigue remains. intrigued see different levels governments Canada handle children immunisation.

P.S. Sorry English mother tongue. question matter works? People jobs successfully home since pandemic, understand wanting take overhead again.  Yes, breakthrough case absolute hell. I’m glad double vaxxed moderna. close admitting ER never got tipping point (doctor said I’m struggling say word), called online urgent care every day. Started non stop tickling lungs dry cough came 3 days later. breathing became difficult got point say words time medicine worked. symptoms peaked around day 7, sign improvement day 14 (nor get worse) little worrisome knowing what’s going happen. advised leaving house get tested online doctors didn’t want risk took home test positive twice. I’m male 20s Im probably statistical anomaly. going catastrophic crash commercial real estate prices plays out, smart money would investing converting office parks residential housing. exactly boss everyone pissed. talks nonstop wonderful back office. Meanwhile departments organization even considering yet. Bottom line got bored lonely, wanted us come back in. assume vegan right? know symptoms without vaccine? I'm glad said sentiment. WFH tool adapt give employees flexibility event emergency travel something, standard. makes everything efficient degree, need office collaboration things well. Keep going forever, we've proven better everyone, even assholes want everything go back ""normal"". ""We're productive person""

I year metrics says otherwise. definitely see others coming from. I’m lucky enough decent sized house office keep separation work . I’m older I’m really “making friends” phase much anymore. 

But definitely times life would board this. people extroverts and/or social, parents, people shitty WFH spaces, totally see won’t work everyone. 

I think companies size offer hybrid long-term hopefully get back it. good news think companies insist people office time always hiring probably go find companies way. 

We huge proponents WFH avoiding types places..lol.  Never trust cat.
Dogs. Dogs loyal trustworthy.
I NEVER trust cat. always agenda. Countries handled COVID well--Delta included!--have relied almost extensively mitigation methods like testing method proven work well. US one countries barely utilizes testing practical manner one first things CDC botched (an incident forgotten reason) pandemic started.

You assured almost anyone dismisses value testing COVID preventive measure, especially one allows normalcy, American. i’m curious know activities improve cognition might help people covid induced cognitive decline Real head scratcher, one... Yup. blunder \*might\* worse Fauci saying masks provide protection back beginning pandemic. finally stop whole vaccine passport nonsense. Amazon. They're awesome. I’m gonna spend 8 hours day work certain people, I’d rather friendly isolated. hating coworkers reason WFH feel sorry I’m worried might delta variant. Symptoms are: blocked nose, scratchy throat, chesty cough, sneezing, headaches, sense taste smell whatsoever. double vaccinated wanted see anyone else symptoms tested positive? Smallest violin world playing boss yet we're still seeing cases go up. goes show contagious delta is. 50% vaxxed delta, practically without vaccines. Except large amount population completely healthy still succumbing disease. Others left long term illness report even top sub today indicating widespread cognitive changes previous infections. saying that's life lives ruined lives ruined? 

I think need focus getting numbers manageable levels, pockets small outbreaks translate country wide surges. also need additional, effective, widely available early intervention treatments. Nasal vaccines help bolster current intramuscular vaccines well, help boost effectivity. There's ton things throw hands air say, ""well, fun, good luck."" I’m leaving current company this. Still process interviewing jobs right I’m looking teams remote foreseeable future. employer pushed back date return office Labor Day sometime October, that’s good enough. Working home really freeing. sure hope right. inside conversations regarding work home couple different senior management teams God, trying way get people come back office. cynically, also think Biden administration wanted vaccinated people get board opening economy back fully. less likely thought still risk degree. coming back March 15th, next day boss told go home stuff. Gov mandate mask law? Governor Abbott Texas made law wear protective mask. Stated would withhold paychecks superintendent teachers did. allow another break Covid-19 spread Delta variant. think money/greed important lives! One school found loop hole, made mask part ""dress code"", applaud this! This. I'm exact situation. sit desks get Zoom calls other.  policy kick 8-25.....  weekend wide open. ""Ancedotes tell us data doesnt"" bad take honestly thought would safer people would right thing.

We need optimists like you, ever change.

Maybe little bit safety. But, much. Whoa where? managers won’t get paid nothing yell you. old manager paid literally online shop Airbnb “shadowing” people (I.e sit desk micromanage them). There’s use role like anymore. perspective would like that, though I'd probably feel pressured least somewhat. keep secret current job (well, keep lot secrets actually). Office Space 2 works definitely doesn’t work all. 

A lot happy hours likely people faking order “team player”. all, most. 

 people know don’t want socialize coworkers.  Many fake order keep job. 

Just wait someone throws bus work group deal office bullshit goes it. 

I learned early career kind caring coworkers situations, socialize outside work. 

I go work job contractually obliged do. help assist anyone can, listen telling personal stories engage, that’s relationships coworkers stops. 

And many people know same. Could anecdotal it’s experience people know. That’s true. that’s hilariously bad 😂 Imagine believing vaccines kill taking horse dewormer cure something vaccine help with.

Nope, can't. Far much mental gymnastics right brain handle. replying troll, check comment history. Get projects done. don’t you’re fired, do, awesome you’ll get rewarded.

This attitude years yet seem attitude employers.

The amount hand holding helicopter managing I've experienced absurdly high.

Did hire adults job? treat like adults trust get work done fire them.

The number reports showing reporting damn high! know what’s awesome. get slow need get break, go dip feet pool watch YouTube couch. Better yet, wife gotten coworker last 20 months absolutely love it! It’s like friend goof around also kiss them. It’s reason I’ve ever worked. Need get relationship. Yup. surprised well. extremely strong culture. Pre COVID everyone ate lunch together, went walks, played catch/ping pong, name it. developed strong bonds one another. haven’t grown since COVID stands reason many miss people  think really need separate work environment normal life. home good, everyone space available. 

Plus everyone developer job everywhere. Wow. numbers thing.... Delta contagious going ppl exposed fall ill. rare event kids hospitalized covid becomes prevalent they're re-socializing (often maskless) schools. Parents overly protective kids, creates frenzy.  There's something else going productivity dropping badly. employees juggling spouse kids, too, productivity went course 2020 2021, profits. Taking office virtual exposes weaknesses obvious before, blaming spouse kids persuasive. means that, part, work completely alone little input collaboration anyone else--even editing process deliverable boss can’t figure effectively you’re working home, isn’t bossing properly. expect would sorta thing. also expect smart employees keep track stuff either get raise get company pay expenses it. It’s middle managers become obsolete. Directors Zoom team team leads driving work flow. bunch 6 figure managers sweating job. ""I went shitty situation everyone else too!""

Classic asshole viewpoint anyone know intranasal vaccine closest brought market best timeline might be? I'm really thinking combo intranasal + intramuscular might really effective route prevention. Children can’t get vaccinated yet guy literally compared democrats democratic policy certain regime Germany 40’s, according comment history.

He’s beyond reasoning with. think you’re symptomatic tend accurate. PCR used confirm antigen results, PCR shows multiple results conflict antigen, I’d say it’s safe trust it. course, none tests 100% accurate, sounds like you’ve done could - tested yourself, taking precautions, etc - don’t think there’s much worry further

Whoops, missed comment passing onto kids. I’d probably avoid contact increase precautions (if can?) test 5 days since last contact. also partially it’s cold, could spread others too, colds would show within days. definitely little cautious wanting spread anything others, think it’s totally within reason trust double test negative keep you’ve normally won’t survive don’t adapt. That's 1 Million doses one day BTW

And state population 114 million according 2011 Census  may able get 10+ wears they're high enough quality get wet. much that, especially time, risk bacteria building them, trickier getting without also reducing effectiveness mask. problems exposed exit interviews exit interviews \*taps temple\*  supposed go back Tuesday Thursday F home. welcome new office new desk thingy mid July official “go back” beginning month. 

It got pushed back January. amount free nitro cold brew Waterloo’s make want go back.  Ah mean sound like arguing you, meant CDC would still want get us vaccinated protection provide still effective despite possibility may less effective previously thought.

So guess speculation would CDC want scare people would otherwise get vaccinated.  Wait find P-100’s. 😉 Same, nice know everything fine long show meetings time deliver stuff need agreed date. never miss deadlines nobody cares go take hour long nap middle day clear head. It’s much humane sensible way work. guess would best interest mandate vaccines. am, wish others would Productivity may stay may even better bosses lose control things. Like control talk benefits, wages.

That concern really is. Exactly. would want happier workers? would want decrease rent utilities? office gym? free food? events ping pong table? pale face home. Offices place it’s everyone hide inside office get done could’ve done without commute. workers essential one way another

[Not disturbing amount jobs contribute essentially nothing society.

What percentage could matter debate, definitely *some* people work nobody would really miss done. like said, majority co-workers also kids spouse, productivity go up, went down? *nods Mandalorian* well, least that’s small positive! team do? I’m looking job change would like find industry embracing remote work.  unsolicited advice? Don’t wait talk recruiter. Start making connections now. not. Imagine Delta without seniors vaccinated? 

Vaccines working. things Charlotte masking, social distancing vaccine adoption? I’ll admit, good days bad days. instance, Friday fell asleep couch two hours EOD. days I’ll work 10+ hours I’m focused.

I’m generally less prepared work morning also. wake 5 minutes first meeting, whereas would couple hours awake arriving. yeah idiots saying ""done"" masks months everyone knows towering power idiocy former job trying hire new office staff specifically putting ad they’re offering remote work. It’ll fill positions. current job two new positions open filled week two hybrid schedule offering, minimum one day week one positions. People job home want home. welp looks like PCR appt today already gone I'll antigen tmrw. thanks tho! live DC would call area ""high risk"". never really got covid bad, high rates vaccination, generally good policies place people follow them, areas densely populated. bars, restaurants, movie theaters, pretty much open.

We friends NYC similar there. public transport population density etc vaccination rates high awareness. Rural NY different story but, ironically perhaps, cities many ways safer.

No first hand experience Boston Philly would actually think cities among safest country. friend another company offering new package starting next month - elect become full time telecom worker, give desk chair, besides computer, monitors, printer, etc. far far cheaper paying building space. , engineer moved get job RnD training right virus hit, makes mentoring people incredibly difficulty. 


Learning converter control linear algebra remotely intermittent support teams call super frustrating . White orphans?  hard younger (ish, I'm 30) worker, looking build work friendships. kinda wish exposure similar-aged company instead wholly remote... like commuting more. First world problem suppose. managers worried _their_ jobs, people year two demonstrating productive without manager looking shoulder, timing smoke bathroom breaks. Yeah, feel like people would better option either. people work better home. people work better building people. really want believe this, sites I'm seeing say reuse them. source? Appreciate it! Look Aaron Collins YouTube. gives legit sources. summer spike last year earlier worse rest country 

The prevailing thought Florida hot, everyone spending time inside air conditioning. inside higher frequency majority states windows closed air recirculating  Scary, luckily supposed “prevent hospitalization death.” sincerely believe would’ve hospitalized wasn’t vaccine. know. one kids. done. Given received many downvotes less news guess news outside US well liked users? seemed like insipid bullshit since day one, much like attempting use terms like ""olds"" period 3 months 170 million. There's proof. mandate opt reason isn’t much mandate. didn’t ban mandates made entirely toothless. functionally same. bring unvaccinated kids. End story. Came read comments taking joy everyone dying, disappointed. True disappointing. problem middle managers corporate might realize people *more* productive without manager looking shoulder times.

And corporate might realize need many middle managers. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

It also leads wonderful lies. performed ""an exhaustive nationwide search"" new VP, know it, found inside company. third time line used announcement email. Take empty office buildings convert medical facilities. would get Covid unvaccinated order keep general population. outdoors Delta-proof.

Then welcome lock room next months. sure be. vaccinated person, worried all, interested making sacrifices protect anti-vaxxers themselves. you. Cognitive deficits found severe non - severe cases. Journel linked think based issues, pretty imperative consider another flu. think we'll get eventually fairly easy avoid annual interventions. hope I'll around day happen given risk factors control. Fuck office fuck management think makes sense drag everyone back in.

“It’s culture!”

What’s culture? Arbitrary “because said so” types rules? culture butts seats? Go sit spin!  big Facebook person supposed way flag posts ""false news"". sure they'll anything try. also find employer let know. need cyberstalk usually pretty easy find someone's employer via Linked something. Visited Hawaii June. locals masking, masked too. Maximized social distancing. Tested prior arrival followed protocols.

It's understandable visitors lumped together places like Hawaii circumstances dire due logistical challenges isolation. However, again, resources available travel safely exist folks maximizing resources.

There folks comfortable indefinite total isolation, realistic option everyone. I'm ashamed say wfh made dedication productivity drop much. take multiple hour lunches breaks. 

Funny enough still get work done get recognized projects complete got perfect annual review fat raise. 

I've never happier. (25%) 7,608 hospitalizations reported asymptomatic related COVID-19.

Is reading hard you? mean people willingly refusing get free vaccine prevent spreading virus, killing others.

I would argue that’s opposite petty! think fair ""shit"" countries letting life-saving vaccines expire plenty countries could use vaccines.

I really undestand point trying make - one said anything vaccination effort Canada US whether think SK ""deserving"" debate - topic conversation. seems like whenever someone Reddit posts simple fact vaccine still much effective Delta people still absolutley need get it, inevitable ""EXCUSE CO WORKERS HUSBAND'S FRIEND'S BROTHER GOT BREAKTHROUGH CASE ICU ALMOST DIED VACCINES DONT SHIT DELTA. NEED LOCKDOWN 2023!"" May, basically said vaccines here, anything more

As institutions businesses government anything anymore? Seems right. CDC also real power actually enforce recommendations make, good they?

Vaccination always treated group effort, individual solution.  think holy cookie probably right it’s guess obv. point is, tons smart people government including CDC. doesn’t make sense track stop tracking breakthrough cases unless reason want data shared publicly   G big deal unfortunately. anxiety issue makes wearing masks nearly impossible without hyperventilating. makes feel like asshole people understand want like I'd like able wear one without issues. I'm working I'd like think I'm getting better time tell guess. senior partners charging $1500/hr also networking power gets lot red tape etc. yes employer could mandate before, employeers legal departments, keen possible liability forcing employees take something emergency authorization. probably cautious legal opinion. least employer case, full authorization require it.  I'm getting sick tired CEO's managers keep living like 1960 think people office equals productivity. 

Its flaws become apparent people working remotely. harder put blame underlings manager. 

For personally, cannot work remote, search another company take 16 years experience (I business side). 

Also treat workers same, decades, work dictated extroverts thrived busy social workplaces. give peopel choice want work accommodate environment productive. Happier people means productive people meaning better business. Never forget narcissists need people around validate them. probably would better put extra 5 hours…..we’re talking normal 40 hour work week here. Obviously sounds like everyone happy trying criticize think it’s slippery slope. kind sounds like hard replace bad company culture would rather working 35 hours instead headache replacing you, seems like you’re taking advantage *them* know mean. Googling found study. obviously vetted thoroughly 10 minutes, discussions I'm still going study itself.

journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250780#sec002 

Which short tells Coronavirus easily escapes vaccine immunization evolutionary process.

Interestingly study also found comment visible here:

journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comment?id=10.1371/annotation/fb9baabc-3302-4085-a354-7e3d3addd0e8

Who seems hold similar concern, mainstream reporting vaccine induced evolution incorrectly.

Of course result maybe found due confirmation bias, may something I'm missing well. Senior leader - truly empower employees functions area business, prioritize production outcomes, de-prioritze time-spent + locations, see production increase.

You'll find respect employee's desire autonomy, freedom choice, flexibility, they'll respect return (and thus create value company long run). 

ANY successful relationship based mutual respect communication - workplace relationships different? Never forget narcissists need people around validate them. close age would hate deal that. 
Did exercise and/or after? 
If so, notice effect gotten sick? There’s paywall I’m trouble posting text article mobile, would greatly appreciate there’s anyone might able help. Thanks! YES! Hope COVID kills unnecessary commutes good. definitely say A/C increase running multiple PCs (my roommates using gaming rigs work home devices, typical office PCs) jumped utilities quite bit.  r/wowthanksimcured guy considers secretaries admin assistants BS jobs. I'm sure boss would love spend 2 hours tech support able download latest update mail machine 15 emails back forth idiot vendors double bill company cc still send wrong product rather actually dealing day-to-day. many places cycling work isn’t feasible too. cold. hot. SUCKS rain. Ice makes really dangerous. live Michigan could feasibly bike work maybe 2 months year. know - sorry. I’m trying figure post text mobile. Great! let's get funding convert commercial office buildings residential housing. board hasn’t met person since February 2020. went back person sweet, sweet money April 2021. plans meeting person future. district office workers, gave massive bonuses working whole time, fact MIA work working home. I’m shocked unprepared. What’s going Scotland? cases coming weeks. it’s skyrocketing again. Victoria done fantastically pandemic. would say that? Tbf that’s paralegal, associates juniors exist haha Wow...I’m 60 year old started job similar circumstances (niche-ish skill, company different state). Exactly. They're creating artificial shortage, Bay Area, seemed like made actual shortage even worse last time making vaccines available zip codes. Basically lower-earning zip code would receive vaccines, many people actually *want* vaccine, would sit freezers areas impossible book.

The incompetence incredible really Well, many useless managers lot companies paywall  Agreed 100%

We still workers hate though cuz NEED face face contact gossip.

Ive never happier working home alone cats Well that's really dumb then. thought immediate policy."
