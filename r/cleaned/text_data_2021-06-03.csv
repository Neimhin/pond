Let's call position though masks might effective worn medical professional probably general public better strategy encouraging symptomatic stay home ""masks work"" position. let's call position masks effective public health measure therefore mandated America's public spaces ""masks work"" position. gross oversimplification, simplify talk this.

Fauci said masks work. said variety ways public time always slightly vague, one emails explicit.

* extent extrapolate Israel US compared peers, seems interesting unexpected reduction R\_effective mRNA vaccines provide captured vaccination rates.
* indeed suck many anti vaxxers. But...realistically, good fraction already infected, level immunity.

My hope factors enough us keep R\_effective 1. True, linked article King County, 75% residents 16 years age older received one dose, 63% fully vaccinated. two different data sets, disagree causality. also predicted large spring surge vaccine-evading variants, didn’t pan out. (To fair, wrong opposite direction last year, too.) 

I doubt fall look anything like last fall, though. focus getting people vaccinated, lockdowns mask mandates. saying is... murder pigs birds... *there's chance* TY. *were* slow start vaccinating. bought lot treat timing nearly important have. like show % covid hospitaliaztions unvaccinated. Hope help, really need get vaccinations up, especially Maricopa county. mean even patents released there’s significant amount resources needed actually build vaccine plant. Don’t get wrong think would net positive current atmosphere bring competition let manufacturers make vaccines. there’s unfortunate reality companies capabilities produce mRNA vaccines. mention there’s quite regulatory steps build, certify validate plant order produce product that’s acceptable people use.

Somehow it’s bad India export vaccine early think US export vaccine early?

Never mind daily deaths per capita within 20% India’s substantially deaths have.  someone (politician?) gave free joints nyc 420. missed it. sad. article completely wrong ..but surprising since airline centric publication

The recommendation end mandatory quarantine, mandatory hotel quarantine. They're recommending end mandatory 14 day quarantine..just first days hotel awaiting test results says forget herd immunity variants - update vaccines tackle variants get rolled everywhere get herd immunity - Covid chance evolve complete suppression. course, vectored vaccine, AZ/Oxford cannot part play this.

Another pro-Covid piece - imagine that, unlike every pathogen vaccinate against, Covid somehow turned 'just cold'. 500k J&amp;J would us fine Barbados. Need get back lives. vaccines already free. Yes longer part EU. Actual countries EU taking approach.

We smart follow UK's strategy. Thanks this. Kinda like expected, don’t really see smoking gun here. Culturally, may never get lot people raised selfish here. sent another reply, sure got buried though think introverted people distinguish strangers people know, people want around vs people forced around (work). stop talking even seeing people wanted around. ""back normal"" means ""back around people choose around"" many people.

Whether someone happy sad pandemic depends individual circumstances, usually work. work life better worse without physical presence random people? work home arbitrarily forced come back office? work even worse due stress random people grocery store whatever height Covid others sat home? worse busier curbside non-stop 8 hours?

For good reason, people questions might apply think differently. time lives actually improved work-life balance, others even deeper level hell normal. There’s Covax summit that’s related Covax-in vaccine Great.

They near zero cases.

We per capita daily new infections.

Sadly tons idiots, might get Chinas level control. reopened. given level immunity, suddenly lot social contact infection rate go up. 

Think adding bit kindling small fire. still small, bigger was. Ingorance shows, ffs. Gdamn. US UK domestic manufacturing laws place product domestic product. Every country side two experienced issues canada ahead catching 3 month ahead start us. Sure frustrated situation, lay blame government lack vaccines january shows lot ignorance.   Idk think validity criticism. We’re better went demoralizing third wave Ontario largely slow initial rollout. Whereas country like UK not. want say reinfection? exceedingly rare? page 5. PHE report Mid May estimating AZ two doses 89% effective UK variant. fact recent study claimed efficacy AZ 66% make sense and, given PHE report based far data, seems realistic cast doubt 60% efficacy figure AZ Indian variant, people study admitted themselves. pretty rough history contamination, losing contract money. like one needle? Try thousands needles! could give country high infection rate afford vaccines actually save lives. nope, play politics vaccines annoy China. No. Never completely. lot flu types cross-infect various animals. Pigs birds, particular, spread influenza. may add this, China exporting 60% vaccines mortality rates infections control.

However, think case also made lot rather privileged people country chose believe take viral threat seriously, contributed decent amount infection rates. digress though, think anyone reading reddit articles already knows too

Thinking loud, felt important note least Darwinism start hit dumbest fucks hardest instead everyone.

You would think that, higher death rates actually tend result higher birthrates. could reasonably increase population overall. Yeah, read book “spillover”. takes crap ton time, effort energy get bottom things. still even Ebola mystery. bad thankful older relative's death happened funeral? 15 year old got 3 hours ago. He's tired AF headache. agree. It’s entirely speculation, course, I’d guess hover around 5-10k/day average while, totally acceptable. it’ll probably cause lot companies businesses remain skeptical enough completely revert normal cause large tail end.  released Freedom Information Act. Seems like two emails critics honing one Feb 2020 saying masks effective preventing infected person transmitting protecting uninfected wearer, email someone else thanking debunking lab-origin theory. Fauci clarified reject lab-origin believes animal origin likely. apologies, again, dont know much should. found better example show talking about. India largest vaccine production facility world, used export primarily United States 2020, despite increasing covid19 cases.

Now, India hotbed Covid deaths tragedy. greed accomplished? Sure, us safe, think safe assume common sense would remained safe allowed India keep portion vaccines citizens, no? least, would prevented far deaths densely populated country.

Over 60m doses viable vaccines diverted India US elsewhere 2020. note, manufactured Covax, Novavax, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (the latter got pulled reinstated). also deal AstraZeneca deal left keeping vaccines well. Less 1/10 people able receive one dose vaccine India due disparity demand US countries--this changed much since last year.

Now, sit await end restrictions, (this generalized statement I'm saying everyone acting careless) meanwhile lament dying tens thousands around globe, despite also exacerbating issue them.

2) time neighboring cities countries (Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Qatar)relied Pfizer murmurs Sinopharm ineffective cases going despite one worlds highest accination rates

3) suddenly April, announced pfizer would made available, people took Sino wont get it

4) another u turn even took sinopharm (more half country's adults) take pfizer

This clear get Sinopharm isnt effective compared others. good take options live study surveyed British people. everything US politics. feeling well one weirdest viruses month lungs. suddenly realized covid kills basically drowning.

 gamble completely illogical. would never take COVID side rational actor. surprises top (slowest / hesitant) states list are... followers 3 starred elephant. cold already worked it’s way household us least partially vaccinated (the toddler holdout), it’s silver bullet colds. decided make marching band uniforms wool?

This result public health largely state responsibility. think two factors: one Bible Belt, larger minority population, particular African Americans.

Just use anti-bacterial soaps hand sanitizer always great. trying completely sterile every day life probably result problems solves. 

The goal kind balance. Everything moderation, ya know? checked state records still received vaccination record. makes wonder undercounting. don’t believe bronchitis contagious. surprised learn this. back think people also forget tracking animal hosts virus often takes while. first human outbreak Ebola 1970s still fully clear species natural reservoir. lot researchers think bats primates play role, getting crucial confirmatory evidence take *long* time. That’s IHS Alaska, though. Several villages reached 90-100% vaccination rates. That’s mostly reason far ahead beginning Spring summer colds worst! guess would people employed take care elderly simply can’t afford take days sick due lower salaries. Hence bringing virus work. Interesting. sure got downvoted, heard significant inside. aware humidity relevant outside terms transmission though. welcome; occurred morning I'm sure many people also considered this. Uk one pro-vaccine (not even sure that's proper term lol) populations tho really. least free. understand universal healthcare paid taxes, unaware people pay supplemental insurance medicare medicare pay everything. parents pay least 5k year combined healthcare plans. still much lower average younger person's healthcare plans, 10 years that's still 50 grand went retirement savings healthcare. logic it. avoiding unvaccinated, undoubtedly cut risk getting breakthrough case.

But risk already low reasonable people would choose ignore ignore low-magnitude risks, cutting really mean much.

It depends look it. choice make. understand we’re talking less 1 500,000 mortality rate kids, right? fucking stupid. people died *something*. Excess death jumped rate seen since last major pandemic. people died expected large margin. die? deaths heavily correlate covid hitting nation? 

The denialist need reality check. Whenever somebody touts bullshit strike back ""well, people died something. insinuating spontaneous surge people dying randomly? Something add people die covid. "" No, it’s hesitation. reason far ahead beginning Indian Health Service going village, vaccinating almost everyone, moving next one. One 30k cities you’re taking community 3-4 towns one county 100k people. group towns (one hometown) 30% and, along Anchorage, reason we’re far behind.

Ozone toxic breath though. would run air cleaner then? nobody room? defeats purpose. Lol selfish. greater good. Think grandmas.

I hope conuntries take away soon, need 2 tests fly Italy month reason I'm fully vaccinated. want know vaccine threshold protect public health, still don’t go back office full-time. want number. absolute sense, exactly amount Like said, I'm sure whether right time go less frequent reporting, think clear time that.

Why? Nowhere else done except purposes downplaying pandemic, there's nothing gained it. Whereas, something gained instead upgrading reporting daily causes.  school wearing masks indoors next week done. many kids vaccinated. Given China likely (unintentionally) caused pandemic due lab oopsie, *should* playing major role ending damned thing. live bible belt frustrating often I'll hear people use religion justify getting vaccinated. I'm talking ""I think goes religion"" arguments either, rationale I've heard far ""I believe God I'll get sick die COVID thats God wants, God wants there's way prevent there's reason get vaccine"". retort usually ""god helps help themselves"", though probably start quoting verse testing God.  Isn’t science study real world phenomenon using quantifiable data en masse?

I’d argue science better reflection real world experience one anecdotal experience.  Well, less work absolutely. separate question whether causes bigger issues miss report.

I know easy sit say available time easy, someone works digital communications promise frequent communications a. free/the amount work less frequent b. come tradeoffs. example, there's much anyone process - providing much info, especially warranted, helpful communicating. 

Like said, I'm sure whether right time go less frequent reporting, think clear time that. Policy makers federal government agencies need know information daily basis. We’re nowhere close situation safely assume never need information again. feel optimistic comfortable right doesn’t mean forget Covid exists. guys going great summer New York.

There much someone could say stats vaccines work. excuse get tbh  Vitamin fat-soluble vitamin Doubt it. Even medical personnel get shot administered someone else.  announce civil and/or criminal liability unvaccinated person spreads virus? i.e. unvaxed test hot, better hope nobody else traces back you. point outbreak happen poorly vaccinated areas, hospitals could overwhelmed (again). Nope -- Kansas anymore. 😉 mRNA platform development decade, correct? 52% county state that’s 70% first dose list. can’t tell proud not. don’t want states closing down.

It’s obvious comment chain claim they’re asking source saying natural immunity less effective preventing infection vaccination. one claiming acquiring natural immunity equally desirable acquiring immunity via vaccination. Absolutely! that's important note.

But person responded talking cases, hospitalizations deaths, relevant point UK using vaccine effective preventing *cases*. amount support re-openings get says otherwise. think probably seasonal spikes areas low vaccine uptake probably scale previous spikes. florida counting daily cases affect quality life... whatever want vaccinated

what vaccine evading variant appears way tracking size reach...

the country levels something endemic like flu. 

you'll accuse fear mongering, wanted track virus currently ravaging everywhere except north america europe. Corticosteroids definitely overprescribed United States, agree 1 6 probably overestimate. hold second... telling vaccines actually work?! Well never... /S scenario. simplest demonstrate thinking ""hospitals can't overwhelmed"" necessarily true vaccinated wife essentially lockdown sake 6 month old. everything returning normal, need make sure daughter doesn’t get fault own. Look India variant. deadly spreads easier vaccines arn’t ass effective it. it’s already spread North America international flights. wish people would stop peddling ""less effective myth"", AZ Pfizer almost 90-95% effective stopping serious symptoms death. Emergency use authorization not. labs miss week issue bigger. labs report week state still reports daily still less work weekly reporting issue goes away.

I recognize Florida may using modern technology work free may paying people minimum wage instead, absence there's reason delay reporting. one half million people participated vaccine clinical trials make vaccines available, think it’s sad people choose ignorant make opinions without facts.

You really need learn recognize clickbait articles get information there. article hundreds words say “breakthrough infections happen.” CDC recognize still recommend vaccinated people go lives. fact, they’ve found less 0.01 percent vaccinated people need hospitalized COVID, across ages, that’s probably heavily weighted towards elderly.

Bullshit New York slacking Say one bad thing Krispy Kreme doughnuts. double dare you. rural areas, it’s less think. one sick visitor away. Oh god comment deranged. I’m southeast asia guess buddy? want pfizer moderna theyre hoarded rich countries. SEA countries getting chinese vaccines theyre ones available china also letting us manufacture vaccines (with imported raw materials iirc). people call ‘chinese puppet’ desperate save citizens. 

The us starting share supplies, nice, power play 6 months late. Bullshit conspiracy theories nothing trivialize real issues

Like conspiracy theory coming wet market? truth coming out. Anti-vaxxers? Yeah taking vaccine rolled 6 months normally vaccines take years development approval phases. I'll pass. Nobody knows long-term effects vaccines. 

I already COVID (Which worse cold) likely better immunity someone took vaccine. lockdowns started still went office days week work done remote.

The Baltimore beltway like something Mad Max. People 100+, driving shoulders (idiotic considering amount debris there). name it, free basically cops out. masks fact schools canceled social events cancelled people mostly stayed home? Seriously. Even small scale like bar work at. live cold climate work small bar, rarely turn heat bc it’s packed inside don’t air conditioning summers. past year used air purifiers, kept windows open fans winter first time ever get deathly sick least twice winter. Amazing!! That's really surprising. look states Covid booming last year, low case numbers even low vaccination. Sorta reminds me, fuck havent wearing masks flu season cold? would fewer vaccine buy first place US made massive investments.

But let stop US hate boner clouding judgement.

The US main country subsidizing medical research, turn benefits entire world. It’s beyond mask rules mandatory hospitals practices anyway. Asian countries people wear slightest hint sickness protect others. exactly it. Americans immunity one way other. ""us"" refer think vaccines bad thing. Seems like ""us"" might need choose sources better, cable not. That’s also great considering tamiflu research shown ineffective children elderly reduces symptoms 24 hours. 

Not mention decided publish half studies studies didn’t show Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), neuraminidase inhibitor, approved seasonal flu US Food Drug Administration 1999. number randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analysis emphasized favorable efficacy safety profile. Majority funded Roche, also first marketed promoted drug. 2005 2009, looming fear pandemic flu led recommendation prominent regulatory bodies World Health Organization (WHO), Centers Disease Control Prevention, European Medicines Agency others use treatment prophylaxis influenza, stockpiling measure tide crisis. Serious Adverse Events, especially neuropsychiatric events associated Tamiflu started getting reported leading cascade questions clinical utility drug. recent Cochrane review related articles questioned risk-benefit ratio drug, besides raising doubts regulatory decision approving it. recommendations stockpiling said drug given various international organizations viz also put scrutiny. Although many reviewers labeled Tamiflu saga “costly mistake,” episode leaves us important lessons. article takes comprehensive relook subject, proceed suggest ways means avoid similar situation It’s impossible. flu twice 2019-2020 season. times felt sick ~5 days can’t answer emails, eat, clean etc sick.

And yes flu, cold. know positive flu tests.  likely true indeed, 40 percent countries responded quoted. Biden Harris Administration actually investigate origins COVID-19? important Global Vaccine Sharing program. China produced virus lab, evidence pointing this, need held accountable. penalized, whos say another virus spring lab years time. White House mentioned investigate lab like burglar investigate crime. Monitoring also counting. Monitoring detailed analysis like I've already described. CDC monitors reported cases clustering patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type lot number, SARS-CoV-2 lineage. language controlling slowly rising hatred towards Indians case. anyone know countries using certificates already?  true. much hated cases always spiked dining reopened, even outdoors etc. Food handling important! try screen people. signed vaccine trials happening area last year, form specifically asked job levels interaction people. Yup, regular tests Sweden free, hard book slow response time. Fast tests cost money.

Im moving Denmark month so, rapid testing easily available everywhere spontaneously, mind all. issue add negative test requirement Sweden current testing infrastructure, would disastrous young poor =(   You’re assuming going think things far. It’s almost like vaccines work, something. works school setting, gotten flu multiple times year. (Once 2x month, different strains). Seems like get susceptible respiratory virus. true!! Staying home would best solution. Masks second. Society continues get dumber. According conjecture, yes Almost me, lol Bingo

A lot models making baffling mistake predicting surge would've happened already they're somehow completely oblivious fact country largely operating like normal weeks 

Masks last thing left compliance shitshow weeks CDC started peeling guidelines back someone ELI5 Fauci emails people calling criminal. issues finding non political answers get level protection vaccine get gives. None vaccines protects everybody gets vaccinated. Pfizer may give 90% protection - AstraZeneca reduction disease transmission may low 67%.

Sure. level protection hospitalization, ICU admission death vaccines approaches 100%. catching it. also jumpstart immune response catch it.

COVID actually deadly itself. infectiousness that's problem. protein makes stick cell membranes, second protein exploits specific cell receptor (ACE-2) get inside. 

By time immune system realizes what's going on, panics. macrophages release cytokines cause inflammatory response, they're panicking, mistake inflammatory response infection, release cytokines, creates inflammation mistaken infection, becomes cascading positive feedback loop. 

Anything prevents immune overreaction process starting (ivermectin, HCQ, vaccine) prevent cytokine response becoming cascading positive feedback loop known cytokine storm syndrome.

Even vaccination provide perfect protection infection, stave cytokine storm syndrome, primary mechanism death COVID. might still catch it, get sick, get enough foothold trigger cytokine storm. point, becomes cold, flu. 

And let's real here. case fatality rate much lower official numbers would suggest. 

Every person who's died last year tested COVID. every person lived tested,.

Again, 6 people family COVID lived tell tale. one tested it. extrapolate outwards, I'd conclude case fatality rate possibly 16% official numbers suggest. Even considering redundant positive tests, we're looking 50%.

If healthy, non obese person age 60 immunosuppressant conditions, basically flu.

And recommendation flu shot? Vulnerable people get it. demand every single person must get flu shot, every single person vulnerable.

My younger son, 17 time, got rash toes. daughter (24, undiagnosed Type1 diabetes time) got bad cold left couch-bound week. asthma 49 year old heavy smoker. 5 days. husband (then 37) systemic autoimmune condition 4. son (26)? symptoms all. nephew (23)? Lost sense taste smell felt weather weeks.

Go ahead get vaccination. power you. even vaccination get ""only 67% effective preventing infection"" mean 33% chance dying. Lots people survived made official statistics, vaccination prevent developing serious illness. 

Is COVID serious? Yes. people panic everyone lining get jab? No.  Oh. unaware.
Are vaccines Pfizer? believe that’s one approved finally get it, direct result system complaining about. retroactive?

Also, ideally week actually decent level protection vaccine. J&amp;J made plant Canada rolled shipment J&amp;J factory shithole run like vaccine factory believe report says hospitalized flu-like symptoms November 2019, well/maybe likely covid confirmed. oof USA needs catch vaccine diplomacy game. Trinidad Tobago received 3 shipments china already. also got shitload downvotes reason.

And pretty obvious IMO relation is: Canada far along UK Israel. They're great well-poised even exceed them, yet. Nothing negative that. FDA doesn’t recommend using antibody tests assess vaccine effectiveness.  really. Covid survive surfaces long. Yeah, aren’t origins still 100% decided well? case Ebola seems theory fruit bats, SARS, don’t see anyone would discount zoonosis theory even without much evidence 6 times, we're still waiting them. That's real problem. entire country started opening up. know worked yet not. need 2 doses protected. One dose enough, especially Indian variant. Take new medical technology look see companies developing they're located - wireless brain sensors, robotic surgeries, artificial organs, 3D printing, etc.  true new technologies 30, 50 years ago well. damn right 🙌 Although CDC says seen similar trend J&amp;J: Maybe I'm hung last point. asymptomatic people fact spread virus, even they're vaccinated, want still screen people? person kindergarten teacher go enclosed space bunch unvaccinated 6 yr olds?

*“The lab-leak hypothesis taking oxygen what’s really needing done, cooperating China,” Garry told colleagues recent webcast.* You’re worst.  7 Million allocated countries around region.

That's true. people wait forever get second dose. That's low percentage fully vaccinated people. typically 10 days symptoms hospitalization, another week two beyond hospitalization death, occurs. often looking around 2 weeks hospital admissions fully show data, 3-4 weeks impact case rises show death counts like saying wearing shirt uncomfortable. else say someone thinks that? subjective can't change mind, point they're extremely foolish mentally weak. are, they’re claiming venues restrictions they’re actually NY guidelines. Better get arms somewhere versus go bad. many countries that, Asia. pet theory vaccinating age range creates situation friends either vaccinated not.

If 20 go friends, one party vaccinated. 50 likely everyone is.  Redditors helpful though. Trump era Redditor named PoppinKream literally came threads r/politics recapped article mattered like 15 different sources showing happened previously. really helpful keeping track everything. everything needs WAKKA WAKKA JOKE TIME HEY LOOK MADE FUNNY! *WAKKA WAKKA!*

For fuck sake millions people died. 3.69M according google now. source part 11 year olds? seen anywhere. Teenager here--how quickly side effects Pfizer/Moderna (I got Pfizer) second dose kick in? Got second 3 hours ago, I'm already starting experience body aches/arm soreness. Covid absolutely seasonal virus. Hotter states like Texas seasons reversed, probably winter better going outside there, Michigan saw cases drop like rock last summer. 400 days late got vaccine doses (Pfizer) I'd again. 
I also understand hesitancy. 
It's hard know trust days. Given issue mitochondrial dysfunction sufferers, 150+ proteins thing tip kids distress? also need thank anti-vaxxers sacrifices. Right now, Covid deaths anti-vaxxers, yuuge. smaller handful states prettttty low vaccination rates. Plenty people signing get covid them. Without delayed second dose, would still giving first doses people late 40s/early 50s. look cost COVID pandemic economy, budget etc. Even cost getting one vaccine arm research etc, it’s huge. 

Fuck it, throw goodie bag restaurant vouchers, gift cards clothes $50 gas card. cost utterly inconsequential compared damage caused pandemic. something move from, people variants spawn from. Variants make vaccinated people sick. hard.  actually ships use ferry goods throughout continents, chartered [in Egypt's case] Japanese firm.  Really nice lowering numbers :) curious, percentage cases B1.617.2? Hopefully none 😬? Indian variant become dominant yet US. likely soon, and, given poor levels vaccine uptake, probably cause another spike. manageable, increase cases. Israel's uptake may good enough prevent spike, likely still increase cases given far increased transmissibility Indian variant UK variant. give idea today 90k first doses 50k second doses Ontario. We're fine. 

The supply sooner reduce second dose. 2020 wildness something Im glad put past me. ""Vaccines drop effectiveness every 3 months"", ""You need new vaccination every 6 months"", ""Vaccines 50% effective best"" etc Hey youre supposed use brain! Ugh, IHME model predicting another rise cases fall. really hope small blip experienced last winter can’t bear thought go US vaccine uptake awful, Indian variant, becomes dominant US, cause another spike, like us UK. herd immunity requires 90% vaccination rate... hit that... shut down....

Then pretty obvious inevitably we'll see another wave.

In fact, states seeing increases positive tests.

Most states seeing flat positivity rating. 10 showing decline last week. Several states showing increase last week.  databases 1-5% reporting rate, order heart Mri's everybody covid vaccine. point, shrug shoulders move life matter what. 

I mean, life expectancy used lot lower people still good lives. 

We worry anyway. People got original SARS still lot protection COVID-19 they're 80%. Even vaccines make less deadly, that's still win. honestly wish would close certain pedestrian-friendly boulevards summer months let ppl dine al fresco streets. know several municipalities tried past, many small business owners (non-eateries) complain interferes customers can't access shops car park blocks away. Considering keep flip-flopping whether fully open 21st June, I’m even sure UK list safe countries. Well number, higher count, seems big. inevitable especially souther states vaccinated folks shouldnt care long isnt surging amongst vaccinated population. mean see now-97% pf new cases Washington state amongst unvaccinated. Buy portable aircon unit, price tickets Covid tests Portugal. Best investment ever made, especially comes sleep, stick 40 mins crashing - like light, absolute convert. Israel inevitably see spikes. degree spike entirely them. 

Here's they're at. 

Israel vaccinated adult population. 

[Palestinians 95% 

And children unvaccinated, too. 

[Many experts argue herd immunity require vaccination rate 90% success largely hinged containment efforts. example - still [highly controlled still measures many removed [this week. US following Israel's footsteps. similar strategy. Israel late adopter eradication strategy US never adopted it. 

The US already seeing spikes areas variants spreading. Northern Missouri, example, seeing increase positivity hospitalizations. 

[Several states positivity rate high. suggests spread. 10 states saw decrease last week. states saw changes. Several recording positive case increases. also think important note lag time waves. 

If remember lag time Wuhan US - several months. areas hit first based things like popular trade routes. First China, Europe, UK, US. 

Some waves occurred order due things like lockdowns new variants originating countries. thanks palantir  Haha no. U.S. paid vaccine companies assloads cash make sure Americans got vaccines fast first American economy drives good amount world commerce we're largest consumers world course we're getting vaccines first. many people could saved U.S. shared doses earlier profitable recipients needed get first Thank god US offloading vaccine supply now. desperately needed good vaccine diplomacy overseas, I’m itching travel internationally. Gotta kick covids ass across globe. Damn, show vaccination card get this? got vaccinated back early March.   ""Moderna’s COVID-19 [vaccine shown effective adolescents aged 12-17 **showed new major safety problems** clinical developer said Tuesday."" Tl:DR:

1. Variants dont trouble vaccinations now
2. Forget herd immunity vaccinated population. thing matters immunity wanes time variants disturb vaccine induced immunity(focus hospitalizations deaths)
3. Optimistic times ahead Western countries huge uphill battle everyone else.
4. Critical thing vaccinate quickly nothing else matters That's sorta problem. conflicting information one. [Oh Jar Hmm. Maybe something else like general tiredness works ways, also people saying we’re gonna die CDC’s latest mask guidance. ""These vaccines going India they'll much-needed help.""

""Why vaccinate first?!""

""Okay Bob, here's first dose.""

""Not taking poison!!!"" That's fair.  I'm saying lot factors. Vaccines, natural infection, heat likely part it. lot people complained putting lightly. attack gov't opposition many media pundits. mention social media outcry. actually embarrassing look sentiment vaccine roll weeks ago. never used word “crazy” describe anyone. however use word “efficacy” describe well admittedly new vaccine working hundreds millions doses administered. Nowhere say “efficiency” careful throwing around *stupid* friend There's thing long-term side effects vaccines. nonsense talking point debunked again. Long-term side effects medicines take regularly long period time build body, one two tiny doses administered twice. Yeah silver lining vaccines compared Africa. Chile, Uruguay Brazil huge turnaround September. Argentina colombia concerning. *That's* Canada deserves credit for.

Do though? Compared Germany Canada administed many doses per capita, first doses fewer second doses.

Since peaks late April cases fallen quickly Germany Canada.

So far see Canada's strategy successful.  It'll higher now, nearly bad last winter. doubt we'll see anymore lockdowns. Probably guidance void large gatherings voluntarily. I'm glad things worked us, luck happens longer interval produces higher efficacy. Luck deserve crediting.  still makes seasonable I’d say. person who's died last year tested COVID. every person lived tested,.

There awful lot people - one family included, 28 years old - died Covid related symptoms, long stopped testing positive disease itself, Covid given reason death - Though caught covid, would still alive now!

How many people died covid related complications - deaths attributed factors - died 28 days Covid actually deadly itself.

It's killed nearly four million people far - would call might still catch it, get sick, get enough foothold trigger cytokine storm. point, becomes cold, flu. 

There plenty people ill hospitals, got vaccinated - covid continues mutate, vaccines becomes less effective, number going healthy, non obese person age 60 immunosuppressant conditions, basically flu.

I wish - - millions people already died millions going die, Many many millions others health destroyed point longer live normal lives.

If none family died caught it, got lucky - lot families get lucky, lost members. far four million families suffered death - many deaths over, possibly millions vaccination prevent developing serious illness. 

It certainly gives better chance surviving - enough people get vaccinated, due selfishness, ignorance cowardice - Covid going go away!  interested ""have ask"".

We've seen uptick cases 2020 starting early October, expect year different - actually probably get worse since masks mandates likely scrubbed then.

If cannot time kids start school, good.  never rights. It’s *power* make sense   driving nuts. comes vaccinations we're *really, really well!*

So politicians almost pretending vaccines work? Germans publish something claiming figured out. 'pull' door safety thing can't open outwards speed hit someone. results filthy germ laden pull handle concern, I'll use hand towel anything else avoid touching washing hands. Common Cold: “And mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing lead you? Right back me”. several weeks I’ve cynically positing way get “vaccine hesitant” blocs US (minorities white evangelicals, specifically) get shots pit one another. Iowan remember way back beginning epidemiology department University Iowa tore new one inaccurate modeling curve   mention when. Greece desperately needs increase vaccination rates summer get tourism industry back shape I'm sceptical move happen time autumn.

I guess learn read. amazing thing nobody seems care much. We've become pretty indifferent society.  Wait, middle school band gets go Disney world? How? Keyword ""may have"". could still there. flu kills people too. like anti-maskers say ""I want wear mask, I'm healthy die COVID!""

you gotta think people. would anyone know spread cake blowing? cake blowing occur birthday parties, would already qualify super spreader event someone contagious? multiple people attend party test positive, think there's actually way determine spit cake factor not.

Spit cake gross either way, though. Plus candles kind fire hazard, also wax melting onto frosting ideal.

I think human cultures survived without cake blowing tradition, maybe could look see thing? Same! asthma always get sick least fall winter I’ve nothing since January 2020 (when got something travelling US bad enough later wondered covid - antibody test negative though). think longest I’ve ever gone without using puffer. pandemic may actually end saving lives long term within scope lifetime world becomes avoidant unnecessary things spread respiratory diseases, mask-wearing flu season becomes popular.

Contaminated cake wouldn’t gave covid, you’re standing room somebody covid positive exhaling hard you’re probably boned anyways. Obviously body decision, I’ve seen circulation unvaccinated people new variants keep getting transmissible, assume catch COVID point unvaccinated. 

Given that, one think higher chance bad long term effects:
- novel virus evolved actively replicate kills cells various parts body produce host symptoms keep learning day
- concoction (vax) chemicals known properties taken hundreds millions people far

? people worry flu vanish face earth. Indian ensure guys return due high standard precaution measures lol... saying goodwill, binding contracts put export fiasco basically prevented stockpiling way US UK able definitely contributed extreme health crisis enduring right due COVID.

Also, may misunderstood, position was, example:

If produce x amount vaccine doses, would essentially export fraction gross amount abroad. would allow us keep 80% produce still providing least flow rest world thus begin establish vaccine equity ACT initiative begun put action (probably help primary donor, since could money funding initiative elsewhere sure). saying start exporting 60% population vaccinated, even 50% country fully vaccinated yet. 

Also, writing order, homegrown vaccines compared exported vastly disproportionate. 66m doses worldwide, 11m donations, rest contractually obligated part lifting export restrictions setup US flew face India's ban exports Covid cases began rise. Covax Indian-produced covid vaccine, rest produced exported US countries. total last year, breaks like this:

66m total January 2020 - April 2021

11m donated goodwill

As now, 216m received first dose vaccine India, 43m fully vaccinated. 16% population, despite largest manufacturer vaccines, exporting produced wealthier countries recently. comparison, amount people gotten vaccine (not fully vaccinated) countries:

UK: 98%

US: 90%

Germany: 64%

France: 56%

China: 50%

Russia: 20%

India: 16%

If India kept ""plenty itself"" large disparity here? country 60% population vaccinated (not fully vaxxed) could easily begun type export deal countries still maintaining steady vaccine rollout, didn't. means flu never gonna leave us. work pharmacy, dispense single pack Tamiflu (used treat influenza) past year. That's almost unheard normally. used take subway work everyday. cold every month. locked year sucked, damn didn’t highlight fucking nasty public transportation San Francisco is. None vaccines rushed would make believe. Astrazeneca vaccine example actually development well Covid-19 even thing, mainly designed another type coronavirus first, repurposed Covid-19. Every Covid vaccine created based research SARS-Cov-1, epidemic related occurred 2003. vaccines actually years research poured them, ""8 months."" know lot people vaccinated doesn’t mean effective Indian variant.

I’ve standing produce section trying get different angle fingers get bags apart. here. sick year half. became maskless last couple weeks BAM! got sick. Started drainage, sore throat, sinusitis. susceptible bronchitis pneumonia, mess around decided see physician. put antibiotics prednisone. week half later, thankfully cleared up.

I think started severe mold allergies raining much lately.  means population even masking first place. basically means well way back 100% normal (if right now). read kings county thought referring Brooklyn 😅 Good point, Fauci ever incredibly conservative kind timing projection? I've basically resorted rule whatever timing Fauci says publicly actuality whatever believes worst case scenario privately.  fence Vax. sure long term impact. feels like rushed decision. covid vaccine like flu shot get every year? Again, missing point. never ending stream ""new emergency, let's share tech solutions "".

It woops great, country going hamper economic future whole sectors economy it.

Give away vaccines-- great. Give away technology future vaccines? Great humans, terrible future economy companies spent money development.  struck I've never seen heard current presidential administration refer vice-president. recent memory always Trump-administration Obama-administration.

Catching covid really made wanna turn health around. got mine today evening. feels amazing finally done afraid anymore. many still getting tests? imagine priority vaccines testing.

A positivity rate would give better indicator, seem get sick enough hospitalized either.

""Especially, accurate diagnosis shared, newly found thirteen patients 0% fatality."" study answer question, since prior infection, vaccination. Studies vaccination show response least 6 months, IIRC, lot data longer that, past that, really known.  


It's also hard predict. immunity wanes - need new shots. (We know.). virus becomes fairly uncommon, need new shots (We know long term.). virus mutates way evades previous vaccines, need new shots (some variants definitely resistant.) 


Best guess need boosters, possibly annually, possibly less often, one really knows. It’s estimated India around 1M Covid deaths far. still lot less per person Peru still. I’m sure went wrong Peru cause this. think feel comfortable waiters got masks on... you’ve living rock, may find enlightening research. plenty polls published. Yet somehow got Mono past December.

Can still take appointment? vaccination site within walking distance I'll walking there. CDC says taking ibuprofen like may cause lower vaccine efficacy? India kept plenty vaccines itself. didn’t import single one home grown doses.

And companies India sold us vaccines, wasn’t act goodwill Indian government, nothing like US giving away vaccines now.

Your position start exporting 30% vaccinated, well sort herd immunity, would absolutely caused cases go would detriment world tried slowly raise vaccination rate equally among countries. thing innovation helpful. look really needs poorer countries, good basic care access existing medicines.

Waiting see wave start show signs slowing down. 

Watch P1 variant - it’s hard describe bad get quickly. 

20% fully vaccinated sounds amazing. 

I think we’re 7% first round. Less .1% fully vaccinated. I’m hoping see numbers improve dramatically within next month. cannot keep going like this. freaking love LawyerCraig Reddit Nothing prevent that. got reminded another reminder. Suddenly remembered reminder. done yet Europe, wanted give interim update.

My country, Netherlands decided stop using Janssen AstraZeneca vaccine, thus hit bit delay. models show 85% adult population vaccinated mid-July (in 1,5 months). Vaccination readiness high (around 90%), take vaccinate entire population. probably also means country overtake US somewhere coming month terms people vaccinated people want vaccinated here, US goal 70% adults vaccinated July 4th, goal likely make. mid-July, vaccination teens children could probably start, take around 2 weeks, given amount vaccines large groups are. September 1st everyone fully vaccinated coronavirus (depending vaccination readiness, total population fully vaccinated probably).

Countries higher vaccine hesitancy Europe, even opened vaccinations everyone, soon children well, slowly enough people willing take vaccine anymore. anti-vaxxers ones would buy trade people's germ-infested stuff give kids? used lollipops, spit, toys? positivity rate somewhere around 15% 3%. Daily testing around 60,000 day, around 600,000 day. 

Yeah, pretty much USA. first 10 months risk reduced 85%. yet know.

So yeah, title incorrect. ""at least ten months"". thing upload photograph vaccine card.

So photo saved along what, self entered name?

You want verifier access “your” card, log enter “your” name? (Good luck John Smith).

We got first round vaccines gifted India. would say 20% us fully vaccinated point. believe another small quantity received weeks ago, still long way go. saying one side right saying one side shooting. saying side shooting last 20 years like shooting kindness heart side gotten big would suicidal shoot them, shy shooting side got big. Asking...for friend. much hate vaccinations also tend hate foreigners. doubt soon US starts donating doses overseas they’ll start complaining giving away instead taking care US.  really helpful, thank you. FWIW don’t believe crack pit theories. think Fauci lost fastball recently hasn’t great communicator, deserves statues created honor done app makes database vaccine certificates people businesses centralize system refer to. That's carry picture it. verified app, use scan QR codes like New York's vaccination database would verifier index view particular card? 

Not sure would prevent unauthorized viewing card? 

That's verifier's responsibility. prevent unauthorized viewing SSN file taxes turbotax? would prevent people uploading photoshopped cards?

Try detect photoshopped images 100%.  Nope, that's saying all. saying even xenophobic racist issue like guy trying paint it.

What's criticism though? domestic production way get place time third wave. Ontario well aware vaccines hand yet Doug Ford decided open back anyways even though everyone told to. know get downvoted stating fact Maybe try inject bleach well, tried one yet? been:

* 59.9% (around 200 million first doses given) total population vaccinated least first dose
* 52.9% (around 176 million full vaccinations given) total population fully vaccinated
* = around 370 million doses given (depending J&amp;J doses)
* 6,720 cases per day (7-day rolling average) 

* 0.50 effective reproduction number 

* 189 deaths per day (7-day rolling average) 

* 1.2% test positivity (7-day rolling average) 

* 11,723 COVID-19 patients hospital 

* 4,880 COVID-19 patients ICU

Reality:

* 50.5% (around 169 million first doses given) total population vaccinated least first dose
* 40.7% (around 136 million full vaccinations given) total population fully vaccinated
* = around 300 million vaccine doses given
* 16,239 cases per day (7-day rolling average)
* 0.59 effective reproduction number
* 537 deaths per day (7-day rolling average)
* 3.3% test positivity (7-day rolling average)
* 20,539 COVID-19 patients hospital
* 5,750 COVID-19 patients ICU

Interesting. seems like US certainly worse exiting pandemic vaccinations. Comparatively, worse Israel everything. certain things, like reproduction rate people ICU got quite close Israel. Vaccinations also got quite close, still quite difference, due high vaccine hesitancy US seems. 

Hospitalisations decent well, twice bad Israel exit.

But cases, test positivity around three times bad Israel exit. 

Especially deaths quite striking opinion. always surprised high deaths US stayed relative numbers vaccinations. country (the Netherlands) managed get massive extreme reduction deaths earlier much higher case load (three times high) less vaccines (around 1 month behind US) compared US. suspicion always least country, order vaccinations always strictly followed always prioritised vulnerable elderly first high early vaccination turnout compared US. course much higher vaccination turnout (\~90% wants vaccine here) US. example, well 90% elderly vaccinated, compared 86% US. additional 5 10% elderly vaccinated might mean te difference 180 deaths per day (Dutch rate adjusted US population) compared 540 deaths per day US. sure, however. What's like political cult honestly fucking unreal boris didnt ban india could little wankoff session Modi, still got cancelled Creative accounting, aka fraud.

364 + 219 = 583 doses exported EU much greater need? I've recovered, simply talking nonsense. wave 30 45 going overtake numbers previously seen 65+.

It's really simple.  It’s little late type probing. He’s playing damage control. think they'd vaxxed  20% hospitalizations Seychelles vaccinated people, actually strong evidence Sinopharm effective hospitalization.

We know hospitalization children due COVID extremely rare assume hospitalized adults. [Over 65% Seychelles's population fully vaccinated Since giving vaccines adults, means \~90% adults fully vaccinated.

So vaccinated \~90% accounts \~20% hospitalizations, unvaccinated \~10% accounts \~80% hospitalizations. 

(80% / 10%) / (20% / 90%) = 36

This means rate hospitalization unvaccinated 36 times vaccinated, giving efficacy 1-1/36 = 97% hospitalizations.

Also, reported Seychelles' COVID deaths among unvaccinated vaccine's efficacy preventing death 100% 3:50). thinking flu day, taking measures covid surely would stop spread well entire family got flu late February 2020. time I’ve ever gotten flu.

Plummeting cities vaccination uptake dramatically higher state average. 

Memphis, example, almost 66%. reach 70% despite state average. Nashville.

Cases really plummeting rural areas - never high begin either due population density. 

Statistics states slightly misleading. lot people rural America also LOT land live on, way less interaction, way less virus spreading. many communities never pandemic all. IIRC NY Times us hitting 70% two weeks.  bigger California? there’s one thing america humans whole excellent at, pretending things don’t exist they’re actively affecting us Since way less vaccines demand, pay getting quickly. correct medical term 'Insane Membrane', think.  age group 95%+ vaccinated

This categorically false, given 60-80% age group electing get vaccinated. They’d never moved 85+ age group case. 

Also, young people COVID less deadly flu, doesn’t matter 25s haven’t vaccinated. Let choose whether want go rather restricting like authoritarian tyranny.  Sometimes they'll say ""Under 45s make largest percentage hospitalization since pandemic began"" said monitoring non-serious cases. still monitoring serious cases

Yes. vaccinated person hospitalized dead counted official tally. I've saying over. Otherwise, covid cases vaccinated people report CDC go CDC database

Where find information? We've already established CDC website CDC identifying, investigating, reporting, monitoring, tracking, scrutinizing, counting said first comment OP's article local health department rely whatever CDC doing. 

So following CDC guidelines counting cases? reporting method? source article goes Facebook post nothing actual article... got cold since 2005 got flu shot since 2005. Im also antisocial try stay home anymore, atleast terms vaccine. Modi government dropped ball hard vaccine production Please provide example virus 'good' you, used vaccinations. ~13.9% prev. infection yet ~18.5% prev. infection yet vaccinated

How'd come numbers? taking little longer got like 25million area alone UK isn’t shithole country. They’ve chance vaccinated well. bothered read article, mentioned expert director National Institute Health.

And credentials? extraordinarily rare vaccines ""long term"" side effects show outside 6 weeks administered. relevant?

Even arguing Aral Sea disaster via capitalism, preclude capitalism causing destruction nature... think covid over... people claimed covid multiple times, wave happens....  also highlighted called “a sort Nepal mutation”. mutation Delta variant, suspected potentially resistant vaccines, observation PHE. seen numerous countries Nepal, carries little genome sequencing Covid.

So it’s named country detected once? Brilliant solution get people vaccinated protect vulnerable. Anti vax sentiment problem. 

And people mitigate risks previously . It’s significantly bigger problem due global pandemic  That's nice. wasn't. seems like behavior different people would huge impact results.

That's really good question since think safe assume kind family enrolling trials probably lots things reduce risks. However, that's placebo since drawing population likely cautious people. work. still required wear masks. Seattle. 76% 10 days ago, probably 80s now. Poking around looking bit better vaccination central valley - closer 45% 50% partial+full low HPI areas they're worried about.

And there's data acquired immunity vaccines available all, there's quite lot -- see slides 11-12 (PDF page 6) people living areas lowest HPI quartile positive antibody tests February 2021, vaccination still hard get. Rememer 2020 said mayan calendar 8 years behind, world end 2020  I'm addition others said, also painful. friend get joints ALWAYS hurt. bit late that. thought supposed September. something change? Maybe could also go casino way increase ambient oxygen slightly make us alert productive. Imagine investing thousands month make entire workforce perform % better. conspiracy theories dumbass.

I say ""I know"" evidence. point getting covid choice

Unless can't get vaccine real reason like allergic it. immune deficiency issues, part unlucky 5% people get COVID despite vaccinated. on. certainly true community level places get overwhelmed going places low vaccination rates, wrong assume point getting COVID personal choice lots people forced exposed constantly unmasked, unvaccinated people due jobs. Personally, think asymptotic mild case undercounting, way higher think is. like lot history go off. March 20, got vaccinated March 21…was still immune, clue. trickle studies area least anecdotally pointing towards vaccine response better nature immunity. 

But it’s theoretical. years till get enough data. Asian countries flu something? Wow, find reporting confusing. guess article talking first dose, make clear protections given second dose. No. Even without circulation viruses, immune systems interact things every day. Immune systems get stupider unless there's special circumstances, like cancer, measles (which wipes immunity memory), immune suppression drugs, etc. Haha.. yeah.. origin definitely important. think America’s shifting attention simply human. mean, remember reading origin articles throughout year, definitely spent lot time hunting effective masks, effective cleaning products (we told early wipe things down, remember?), battling nasty coworkers, supporting friends family, etc. 

Very early, remember racing shoppers grocery store meat counter grab day’s limited chicken supply. “Origin” wasn’t thought, know?

Now I’m fully vaccinated everyone want around. I’m pretty interested origin. Room breathe. Neat.

But bacteria, ph level, no? Putting bacteria ur skin healthy, no? 🤔

I wash hands. lamentable necessity dries skin. Im perfectly aware much washing harmful, little literally poison u. 

In particular situation PANDEMIC DISEASE, propose wash more. 🤷‍♂️ Call crazy. 

And stop rubbing ur phone day without cleaning it.

Honestly, level disease ignorance completely expected: ZERO classes school prepare u disease pandemics. Health class concerned premarital sex viruses spread air &amp; proper mask use. expect change. future, u hear less condoms, masks.

Meaning level disease ignorance last decades corrected. means another wave lockdowns 5-10 yrs, next Pandemic travels Africa China. Could partly related worries commission day side effects, can't miss work/childcare? I'm sure that's part it, idea .01% something actually impacts numbers. vaccinated people shedding spike proteins putting unvaxxed risk 😂 path recovery virus US Canada now. virus right (offer void Florida): understand, man. Every person ever flu least week, times ever got tested flu really bad. rubber really gonna meet road fall. Sadly whole bunch antivaxxers gonna dying around holidays. Unfortunately, remember brand model. quick search found dozens similar looking monitors, additional sensors cost roughly same.

I’d recommend pretty much multi-sensor monitor indoor air quality. Especially anything detects PM 2.5 (fine particulate matter), VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds, vapors come paint / glue / new carpet / new car smell, various products), top CO2 temperature sensors.

So many air pollutants profound long term impacts often go completely undetected.

[Article actually pretty sure author removed part article says 0 children died time. Delta variant (First seen India) elicited much smaller anti body response originally thought Pfizer another vaccine (can’t remember which) much booster end year likely needed. It’s way around. There’s faulty idea mask somehow replace vaccines. biggest impact realistically would watergate level crash trust government.

You’re right, vaccines aren’t equivalent masks, they’re better. People still wear masks choose it’s unnecessary mandate vaccinated people wear day.

Things looking much better Israel compared UK. Israel less 70% vaccinated. 63% least one dose.

So think give 70% number. Let's wait UK administer vaccines (including second doses) 63% like Israel still enough, probably blame AZ something. EU continues vaccinating like now, reach goal 70% fully vaccinated adults around 9th August. It’s slightly behind set goal 15th July, it’s believed uptick doses given June July.

_____
The research team systematically reviewed evidence 215 studies Covid-19 30 countries, involving total 105,638 people acute symptoms Covid-19, including data July 2020 (acute refers main disease stage, rather longer-term impacts). studies varied symptoms tracking, research team pooled data compare common symptom among studies tracked it. 
 
 

Across whole dataset, common neurological psychiatric symptoms were: anosmia (loss smell; reported 43% patients Covid-19), weakness (40%), fatigue (38%), dysgeusia (loss taste; 37%), myalgia (muscle pain; 25%), depression (23%), headache (21%) anxiety (16%). also identified presence major neurological disorders ischaemic stroke (1.9% cases dataset), hemorrhagic stroke (0.4%) seizure (0.06%). Patients severe Covid-19 overrepresented dataset whole, studies focused hospitalized patients, even studies people outside hospital included people mild symptoms. 
 
 
But among people symptomatic acute Covid-19 hospitalized, neurological psychiatric symptoms still common: 55% reported fatigue, 52% loss smell, 47% muscle pain, 45% loss taste, 44% reported headaches. researchers say it’s still possible symptoms common severe cases, mild symptoms might reported patient critical care. vaccine still available US July even donations?

I think great job rolling vaccine beginning, like states eventually got point supply overtaking demand, point lower vaccination percentage many states due high vaccine hesitancy. 

The thing happened West Virginia- beginning one leaders, near bottom lotteries try get people vaccinated.

At beginning states efficient rollout top doses administered, states least vaccine hesitancy top regardless fast rolling things start. am. city’s fire department swung deal area’s hospital allow firefighters sign doctors nurses did, ended first shot December 20.

There’s lot pressure stop restrictions “get back normal” even though least months eligible second doses. we’re lucky far better many countries, point. think Would exciting happen small office. know fact us got vaccine (4 total), trade stories second doses went. mind wearing mask, absolutely perk see faces. curious feel fully vaccinated people travelling? snarky question; genuine one.  people vaccinated dont wear mask unvaccinated right? Isnt policies say? Also read really is. Pfizer Moderna first mRNA vaccines ever approved. 

So designing vaccine brand new virus, using brand new vaccine technology it.

Exactly told brother get vaccine done. He’s 43 every health issue think of. Sad hear 19 year old…life didn’t even start yet.. NY lot eligibility, basically 12 up. percentages eligible people, teenagers unvaccinated brings numbers down. states eligibility 18+ count people. wearing mask past year didn’t catch cold. didn’t catch covid either. Maybe wearing masks social distancing helps.  Even 30% we're get COVID, also multiply number (or ratio) many would require hospitalization (which less 1%).

30% infected X 1% = .3% total unvaccinated populations risk entering hospital.

990,000 people, decent number, enough overwhelm hospitals. hell would report today’s data day isn’t even yet? reason think isn’t right time drama that’s playing Florida cruise agencies. IDK, Florida’s approach whole pandemic suspect, probably fine IMO. We’re pretty much past point need fixated daily case counts, lot media outlets announced they’re going get rid case death tickers next couple weeks.

It’s time move now, I’ve patient year, followed rules, got two shots, want 2019 life back. Yes, areas high numbers people high exposure (ideally vaccines, also prior infections) would expect transmission severely curtailed, we're seeing countries happened. Here's key concerning evidence Manaus variant better able evade antibodies. CADDE study estimated P.1 dodges 25 61 percent protective immunity gained infection earlier Immunity gained vaccination appears robust immunity achieved infection. I'm advocating public policy decisions based them; I'm arguing quite opposite. makes sense drop mask mandates move on. People want vaccine get it. People idiots. People *can't get vaccine* pickle, can't keep forever. still show 0 3 days straight.

Again, wrong. See link below.

We getting second doses - whether it’s AZ Sinopharm. 

The scheduling second doses what’s logistically challenging. Ensuring availability within window needed particular vaccine. 

The Sinopharm second dose given 3 weeks later. knowing certain another batch may arrive difference vaccinating fewer people fully (2 doses) vaccinating people confidence second dose arrives time. 

All vaccines administered thru health centers. process diff AZ vs Sinopharm. 

For AZ, vitals taken front you’re monitored 30 mins afterward. affects scheduling appts. 

It also affects go looking for. 
Let’s say expect dry spell vaccine shipments, go looking purchase via donation. suddenly get vaccines close expiry (it happens) must use within specific window time mobilize resources differently ensure used.

Make sure dilute times increase strength   wonder many lives would saved Tucker Carlson put great efforts dissuade people getting vaccinated. Happened entire department work got sniffles couple days first week back  though. That's whole point post. majority Americans using masks social distancing prevent dangerous virus side effect preventing less dangerous virus. sure hard grasp here. Growing family tradition birthday kid blow candles kid wanted got blow candles well, usually 5 kids per birthday. realize weird tradition pandemic. absolutely does. Many folks think sinus issues allergies, could actually air pollution human related matters, think many counties Asia pollution bad always wear masks? Masks work even minute amount, every penny counts allergies absolutely stinted wearing masks ask source Chinese vaccination centers world?

The info find vaccination centers citizens relate within China itself. tyranny face. God forbid put piece cloth face 4 minutes buy lotto tickets. tread something. also understand human beings right make decisions put bodies why.

And nobody taking away right workers there.

Just like right free speech. right free speech shield repercussions people, government.

I’ve noticed (I don’t know allergies aren’t severe year) ever since I’ve wearing masks gotten leas sinus infections allergy season I’m miserable sneezing/coughing/itchy eyes year. put extra loop-de-loops ducting. kill sparrows pay people corpses. would surprised horrified many people medical care field US anti-vaxxers, illogical sounds. 

In fact, nurses seem one biggest pillars entire anti-vaxx movement. People always gross. seem grosser now, gross little while. level gross they've always been. morons use data argue opposite point. Saying super suspicious flu bad year, trying say covid planned.

Yes giant conspiracy planned Bill Gates. result everyone wearing items doctors wearing hundred years prevent spread viruses. dumb. lice? Extinct yet, too?? used always get runny nose sore throat almost almost every flight. wife used make joke it, going holidays means pay price afterwards.

Nowadays realise culprit probably virus vat airplanes are, lots people crammed confined space, carrying germs breathing other's recycled air. 

I hope Covid crisis, entire world become much hygiene-aware. Masking hand washing help reduce transmission one type virus. sick since November 2019. fair, exposure simple viruses good thing, build immunity, idea letting children play dirt expose others early on, builds immune system.

I also recognize past took decade develop vaccines that’s said this, maybe it’s sped up.

I’m concerned fall surge models hyping up. don’t know think I’m even bringing point “courtesy”. I’m focusing making assumption masks unanimously “easy” “comfortable” “no big deal”. can't measure comfort courtesy. can't measure emotions feeling security, they're want tell wearing cloth surgical mask indoors shared spaces minor inconvenience you, subjective hill chosen die on.

I would happily die it. say don’t want wear one it’s uncomfortable. That’s it. Sure bring points like makes using microscope difficult, hinders ability smell urine sweet, start going tit tat back forth subjective opinion wrong inconsequential. (And honestly would emotional investment caring opinion me.) Regardless hold belief uncomfortable matter argument. Ok sorry Candians specifically complaining get vaccines, Europeans shitting us giving away Europeans countries UK [focusing first doses 2-3 weeks Many fully vaccinated received second shut past couple weeks they're mostly 50+. takes time build immunity. Also, Israel shot borders, reopened slowly (initially vaccinated people) vaccinated everyone Pfizer/Moderna. MRNAs effective AZ protecting Indian variant.   related vaccine time. That’s cute.

Good riddance. cost testing vaccinated people who've potentially exposed makes worth doing? right. Pandemics never ended without vaccinations. long case numbers increase much, fine. small proportion young people getting sick large amount cases still risk. die, take hospital bed longer. US well within rights vaccinate US citizens first, another angle this: pandemic control everywhere. 

The longer rages somewhere, higher chances mutations, render vaccines ineffective we’ve seen AZ vaccine. happens negate mass vaccination efforts countries like US.

That's still ridiculous bill 300k. know hospital negotiates lower price. saying numbers still seem grossly inflated. almost died, received bill 300k, would rather died. ""Slammed"" much better fearmonger vaccines dont work... VA quite yet, think 68% least one dose, hopefully people follow second dose. even expecting us get high based bs see social media around town.  Possibly much hurry.

Likely going end July we've done everyone 18 wants one. learned term ""vaccine complacent(/cy)"": types programs go ""anti"" crowd, go people need little nudge (willing get vaccine put see point go way / put little effort it)  curiosity, #1 suggest natural source? Nobody falling scare tactics anyone every critical thinking spout nonsense?! 

Lets think critically, I'll take state example. 47-50% vaccination rate total population, total population round numbers 3 million. also roughly 685,000 confirmed Covid positive individuals pre-vaccine. 1.5 Million vaccinated plus 685,000 natural immunity 73% immunity rate. 

This super simplified math, know people got Covid also got vaccine, I'm making assumption balance un-reported positive Covid spread rate.

Fouci stated need minimum 70% immunity heard immunity... state... number every reported vaccination rate, HALF STORY! Likely want outbreak. Whichever get first. I'm curious count previously disease immunized. Certainly places US well past 70% factored in. like COVID conspiracy theorists  Get shingles vaccine ASAP already, like 90+% effective preventing recurrences. feel same. friend mine like 20 years refusing get vaccinated. asked trip say no. protect truly cannot vaccinated

Who exactly? vaccine widely available. Anyone wants get Yes, mask mandates lifting signs point things buisness usual time flu season comes around. Since one got flu last year, doctors think bad flu season lot natural population immunity waned feds ruled legal ask proof vaccination long allow ADA accommodations. would also throw need evaluate specimens want procreate acceptable genetic makeup, DNA test form intelligence testing. Lol

China increased limit 2 believe recently. right. companies also right (California especially at-will state) determine level risk they're willing accommodate employees. IMHO, would legitimately able fire employee choosing go maskless ongoing pandemic lives stake. probably conservative streak runs me, choice want mean catch jump cliff. bad look. Cali lowest case rate per 100k people? can't get capacity restrictions removed now, never removed. virus always background even 70% vaccinated. Vaccines *significantly* effective masks. replace masks. Well agree not, suits business need employment law generally supports that. Again, caveat aren’t violating someone’s rights within specific protected class. “I don’t want vaccine” isn’t gonna cut maintaining employment type situation. 

A lot people agree perspective made career decisions avoid level tyranny independent health decisions. I’m one people. federal government national database vaccinated individuals since distribution responsibility individual states. 

It's also kind absurd point. 63% Americans least one vaccine shot spread utterly collapsed (by 95% live New York add). easily forged PCR test valid spread higher, see reason vaccine card isn't. one thing that's worse, makes thing bad reason? kind logic that? Kids still die covid, no? Much made UK signing ""mixed vaccines"" quickly clarified happen records first jab lost recipient know. free all.

There also trials mixing vaccines (as several countries) mixing vaccines means common standard UK point time.

This said people 40 first AZ jab start coming round second jabs June/July may see requests second jab Moderna Pfizer. sure treated official line second dose first. don’t want around unvaccinated people think selfish assholes, kinda get it. Yes, among people stupid get vaccinated total bullshit didnt win Awesome it’s valid idea mask isn’t necessary  do... literally every single hospital. tried tell even 2% returns would return $1,666/month, numbers, strong suit... words, that's took lack reaction. course, that's tax winning, see reason go kind depth.

What offer take hands guarantee $400/month. Sadly, likely another result UK government slow mattered. obvious Covid become huge issue India, yet around 2 weeks UK allowed people come back India via places like Turkey.

Given populations large proportion South Asian population also likely onl poorer (as Scotland) less likely received vaccine, probably inevitable.

Will wear mask office, prevent spreading cold?? What’s GP’s? think immune systems weaker year almost expose sickness? I’m honestly bit worried  There's ongoing study UK come fairly soon. second dose last week Moderna. I've AZ/Moderna mix. Felt absolutely fine afterwards bar exceptionally sore arm. Looking forward UK results well EU data coming soon too, Germany France mixing vaccines bigger numbers nations afaik due AZ rules changing bunch us already first dose. read article? People Japan always wearing masks felt slightly sick. pre-Corona. think crazy never became world wide ‘thing do’ prior Corona. “Feel sick? Don’t dick, mask” still banned EUA something handed still requires intensive clinical trials. vaccines come election day sufficient data apply EUA then. Possibility seeing UK similar surge America? don’t think bad US, would like know people’s thoughts ordered 40m doses, already done, assigned second doses needed younger adults simply enough left others. Especially vaccines coming Moderna miles behind. That's great conjecture nothing said ? California’s central valley like 30% though. 

My guess areas low vaccine rates probably q lot acquired immunity covid. strategy UK different US. Government releasing vaccine appointments strictly age, waiting age group 95%+ vaccinated opening next age group. Currently UK vaccinating 25s yet, effect massively decreasing deaths worse affected older people, cost leaving young almost completely unprotected. people actually chance get vaccine yet. approaches work used. us actually discovered watch read awful cable news. theory holds discount natural immunity caused infection. Something tells type people believe restrictions vaccinations catching covid year. point reduction single dose efficacy AZ Pfizer, implies Indian variant better evading immunity extent UK variant. fact AZ Pfizer show similar first dose efficacy suggests due shortcoming either vaccine, simply power new mutation. Simply getting infected UK strain provide much protection sympomatic COVID, since see one dose vaccine provides far less protection Indian strain UK strain. Indian strain become dominant US, since far transmissible UK strain, lots unvaccinated people infected previously, sadly infected again, unless get vaccinated sharpish.  Canada also thank USA anti-vax got leftovers. start open things little there. done curbside shopping. Yeah, distance enough, still helped lot. Distance requirements results lower capacity limits, venue less people so, less infections. pretty hard balance introducing restrictions realistic expectations what's possible. April 16th 4812. title great. $22k cost Medicare billed average. People actually pay $22k. That’s USA thing.... it’s badge honor come work sick, it’s liability company, customers co-workers. 
Pre-Covid, people know Paris would reported coughing waiter manager. Somehow got flu 2020 it’s huge mystery. didn’t go anywhere! think take out? Like said mystery. us! recommendation like would also pretty unethical got placebo would much risk still

I totally get that. I've wondered, people stay home time super careful go places. seems like would skew data.

Thanks answer. thanks part trials! That's actually interesting question. second dose finishing ""training"" immune system, think different method effective. imagine they're going looking carefully this. Maybe companies figure installing HEPA filters would make employees less sick thus, productive.

Or lol. That's wonderful who's taking astrazeneca UK? April 15th, Ontario reported 4736 cases. I'm sure worst day, around Well there's lot consider. can't vaccinated everything, diseases like flu vaccine seasonal might immune time...overall better safe sorry. small thing.

As doctor, constantly contact many diseases, would want spend week cold/flu prevent simple thing? minor inconvenience, personally even forget trouble wearing seeing patients, least flu seasons cases higher.

As patient side (being required put mask go doctor)...how often waiting room sick people coughing sneezing found unenjoyable? patient trouble putting mask hour doctor's visit. Again, minor inconvenience little may help avoid bad week. 

We learned lot last year, totally removing mask rules general public, also easily understand keep wearing certain situations, like visiting doctor crowded places flu seasons. mean bad idea going forward.  I'm going top head read figures recently

Around 75% Delta variant cases unvaccinated. around 3% vaccines.

So general would say decision definitely right thing cut risk another wave. Even one vaccine gives pretty good protection. work lab compounds pharmaceuticals injection. Everything done clean room *must* wear mask. thought work. We've done tests showed clean room gowns (the thing wear scrubs) would bacterial growth wear mask.  got covid already lol. We're fine Texas, need vax. Apparently, tend severe 4-7 days later shot. blinding headaches, blind spots vision, etc. regular headache probably cause concern, especially bad one persists would be. No. According Public Health England Pfizer AZ vaccines 33% effective one dose Indian far effective two doses, one dose enough, thus implying simply infected UK original strain virus much protection symptomatic COVID. Covid-19 coverage, research found 40 per cent countries responded dominant narrative national media “China’s fast action Covid-19 helped countries, medical diplomacy”. 

Which, way, true. also need prevent vaccine resistant variant created. So? Everyone dies COVID chance get vaccinated. point virtually everyone dying COVID unvaccinated. made bed. Let lie it. stop punishing everyone else.  wrong cases dropping rapidly Ontarios peak 4300 cases day. gets 5% population vaccinated win, opinion. make exactly look doctors even professionals. would take anyone six seconds figure “medical” solution problem first figure culture problem.

It’s kinda like wearing mask you’re sick normal circumstances. Logically seems like bit dick move western (maybe general?) countries, wasn’t common all. Yeah, Korean army one death might related AZ blood clots, one 116,000 soldiers got shot. tragedy, seriously sucks, 116,000 people got covid, results would much worse, do? trial in, recommendation like that. recommendation like would also pretty unethical got placebo would much risk still. 

That said, people recruited study supposed people risk virus. people like working close proximity, older people, minorities etc. would help collecting efficacy data.

The way account differences behavior randomizing placebo real shot groups. Since tens thousands people, people going crazy affect results much balanced. Yes, initially US opposite prioritized second dose new first doses. Good point, apparently many moving parts make clear sense numbers quite yet. [concerns they're Ugh makes never want eat Damn, I'm sorry. I've allergies life living Florida. spent time Colorado first time experienced life without sinus pressure. long term goal live it. Sucks different areas agree bodies like that.

And feel like sharing, Japan? culture always interested me, I've wanted go long remember haha ""There's nothing it.""

*There was.* pandemic, diligent handwashing eating, bathroom etc. also washed frequently handled hazardous chemicals. rarely got sick do, typically minor (slightly watery nose sneeze every hour so, type thing). think lot us underestimate much less better feel basic hygiene practices.

As child, things much sick time...  Indoors? heard that. areas highest infection rates UK areas highest rates throughout pandemic. Getting infected UK variant sufficient protection Indian variant, given ability evade immunity. Yes! I’m wearing mask transit on. stops even one cold, it’s worth it. I’ve heard quite people say similar things here. Flu viruses hate one cool trick! Yeah, many people general population realize undercounting everything last March, likely even better now. Same! include clause effect ""subject manufacturing ability"" fired. Yeah go work since last June actually, super windy job always causes issues her, still wearing outside even that. I!!
But still took vaccine.  Anecdotally, know decent amount people rather indifferent getting vaccine. mostly low risk people see much benefit. people incentives help 

Additionally incentives force people put concrete valuations refusal. Like company offering $200, life changing money enough buy something nice. going believe anti-vaxer aunt give getting new TV? continue refuse edge. Ditto - much sniffles winter. allergy season still got because, obviously, live alone mask home. said, worst symptoms occurred morning part, except watery itchy eyes. begin masking Autumn soon evidence flu. fully vaccinated moment, definitely take flu shot Covid booster offered. that's thing. think group referring want data vaccines necessarily ""anti-vaxxers."" They're usually ignorant data released far. presented results simplified format shown safe/effective is, I'd wager lot would change tune get vaccine. get want get people vaccinated short term (and hopefully longer term) natural immunity factor too. 

If need hit 70% immunity, lots communities already natural immunity included Silver lining suppose. Hopefully gotten people hygienic too. So, saying states lower vaccination rates susceptible future outbreaks? may want contact scientific journal get findings published. Hesitant?....

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  It’s one many common cold viruses. think it’s much less common one people get kids left immunity result. new guidelines CAL/OSHA state vaccinated workers put mask around unvaccinated workers. I, fully vaccinated months now, disciplined colleague refusing get vaccinated? able go mask-free feels like keeps getting dangled front face. U.S. giving vaccines away. 0 enough, especially considering U.S. supported patent waiver, E.U. not. subreddit taken hard right turn since start pandemic. Back beginning, felt like people trying one careful they’re being. Now, anyone even expresses least amount hesitancy reopening, even it’s saying feel comfortable wearing mask, get downvoted oblivion. you’re talking Randall Paul he’s real doctor.

Also, neighbor beat shit parking dispute something like that.

That second part isn’t relevant all; like remind people that’s thing happened. Flu shots manufacturers: Oh shit! fully expect given Boris Johnson's choice words along data trends odds everything becoming fully open June 21st low.

I think local lockdowns far likely. reason mess summer vaccination rates likely overtake wave parts country. #1 go-to bit hand sanitizer fingers open bags. 


My back-up option less appealing still sanitary spit: I'll get bit sweat brow any. Never going back licking fingers. Lol. Same. Gotta get immune system caught up. went dinner 3 people, 1 beer felt like rager college next day. Yes, Canada extended (3 months vs 4 months). one reasons UK's 1st dose distribution slowed kind suddenly; 2nd doses up. believe 1st doses available people 30 yet this. 

Quebec decided policy fairly early well (much earlier country whole), I'm sure they'd fit timeline.

I'm certainly grateful UK opening gates sort thing big level. watch ""Tasting History,"" kind person. point I’ll get cold first time since (I don’t really remember). I’ll probably go get tested, depending paranoid still point. need 10 billion doses ASAP. Appreciate help lot people, more, ultimately drop bucket (0.25% global need).  UV-C air-ducts would nice change. think that's thing expensive. I’m family abusive toxic af, seeing done wonders sanity. I’m using “being safe” excuse deal them. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Biden president United States president world. Also US fucking epicenter pandemic recently lmao Yup. Three sinus infections past year top allergies means I've covid-type symptoms pretty much constantly despite covid ever. coughs get sinus infections always last forever. constant game ""what causing sore throat sinus pressure today."" combination. *would* still better EU shown ""total shots per 100 people"", best metric compare countries different strategies. metric, we're 3rd G20 4th among countries 10+ million people. 

But yes, difference would certainly less pronounced very, happy (in ways bold) choice focus 1st doses. 

I wish would willing actually enjoy benefits strategy start opening instead *incredibly* conservative plan point seem pretending vaccines work... that's another argument entirely! fights start..... Wow, whole country didn’t even pay it, selfish US vaccinate every country itself. happened last week. Got sick days. Hawaii upload picture vaccine card central public DB access DB look card.

Yes lol thought experience coincidental read comments below. rarely get sick don’t think sick year this. met friends felt safe vaccinated. next day sore throat turned two weeks congestion. beginning body aches slight fever. got tested work negative. allergies related? never understood anti-vaxxers discourage everyone else getting vaccine. Surely, want yourself, want everyone else order protect herd immunity? Well said. think lot people's frustrations probably summed ""pandemics suck"", instead looked around someone blame pandemics suck much. 

Which certainly understandable human, can't see retrospect premature entirely wise, that's problem. seems repeating pattern everywhere...

This happened whole family. Even lot kids brother's elementary school spreading cold around. No, recommendation indeed end mandatory quarantine vaccinated travelers decrease partially vaccinated ones, addition ending hotel quarantine. Check report ""recommendations."" clear reasoning this.

There trials studies looking impact OTC painkillers immunizations, mostly children (the theory would make shots less traumatic kids). found slightly reduced immunity.  One two found increased immunity.

Possibly noise rather real effect, abundance caution they're recommending it.

Survey article here: Maybe slightly altered Romney method. He's still blowing towards cake, except blows 20 times rather lol might best take one blow side I'm doctor, according webMD might wanna revisit oh, no!

&amp;#x200B;

anyway... Oh think Covid disappear fall? See think difference faith life saving, do. sounds totally scary. happen? I'm going crazy crowded public spaces? Yes I'm wearing mask forever Yup. *oh fuck why* Same, I'm still sure cold end February COVID. gonna luck enforcing countries either, pre post Covid. exactly whats happening, I'm sure many people surprised rise cases. Lifting restrictions socially active segment population still vaccinated obviously going cause increase transmission. Luckily age group also least likely suffer complications hopefully begin recieve first doses soon.

I think likely seeing dramatic version plateau Israel US saw cases really tapered off. Due already low case numbers UK greater correlation age vaccination status US uptick exactly we'd expect seeing. profiting time,. State one factors second wave india It’s going get harder harder public accept vaccinating young kids emergency vaccine isn’t emergency. That's still huge amount, though. also 20% fewer common colds? lost productivity people getting common cold annually something like $40 billion annually, getting colds sucks. knows even works way, interesting think about. Declaring victory prematurely sure way regret. reason open end certain. Covid excess deaths though way visible statistics (they ramp numbers) ""vaccine excess deaths"" actually negative since vaccine almost never kills obliterates excess deaths Covid Yes. private company states right work. Ie fire reason want long discriminatory. I'd love see public transport here, la Europe Japan, see happening time soon. We're car-centric culture here. Same! It’s glorious. I'm crunchy science granola hippie likes dead, got Covid shots, get flu shots, tetanus shots get bad boo boo. I'm allowed back library return collection Where's Waldo books. typical America bad, Canada good reddit shit US can't help everyone. here. strange. Allergies? Sore throat could also talking laughing lot usual. That’s happened lately. used talking much anymore!  Prolly mix Indian variant fact many age groups haven’t vaccinated yet. groups young people meeting none vaccinated infectious variant spreading, makes sense cases would increase. Don’t think deaths hospitalizations dramatic increase though.  Sure, leave Canada several thousand dollars pay reenter country. don't. is. think 1 6000 1 3000 myocarditis cases young men Pfizer (5 25 frequent expected population, sciencemag) joke me. benefits vaccine outweigh risks, think could better. Ok 99% countries correct, also use official data various national health institutes, USA?

However, find strange example count soldiers, veterans prisoners separately rest population... MEGA AIDS businesses like food services, bakeries, etc even large corporate offices? It’s rare lol suggest kids might stronger memory one cold viruses recent, would also resistant COVID infection, then? restrictions. leave time. Hell non-Americans go America time want. know someone went US one occasion pandemic Canada, they're American.  I'm getting back normal 2 weeks bad cold symptoms. Idiot coworker gave hiding symptoms sitting car me. I'd want too. problem thing exist. I'd also want death wished, also impossible. left choose less worse option. Taking Covid vaccine would pointless Covid already somehow eradicated, vaccinate smallpox. Unfortunately Covid exists kills (or hospitalizes), left whether prefer

1. Higher risk Covid
2. Way lower — though zero — risk vaccine
3. Living house next 3–10 years guarantee Covid eradicated anyway, health could deteriorate anyway it. 

So yeah choose best option. avoid Covid forever Lmao Biden Harris forced. Me, too, narrow sinuses ALWAYS get congested way other. Easily healthiest year memory. comment *suggested* it, whether intended not. Also best rebuttals always ones try use someone's grammar mistakes way downplay said, right? 

P.S. meant put effectiveness.  see they'll enforce it, they'll need enforced. Local lockdowns demonstrably work beforehand two levels bordered people simply went pub next town over. caused lower level tier quickly become higher level tier. People idiots. 

The current race reduce cases clusters also slow spread clusters throughout country 'everyone' fully vaccinated. best way slow spread keep levels entire regions tell people stay local areas high cases. Happens time. Try working hospital, even contractor, without flu shot. Private companies behind wheel topic time. Well put. Uber's Canada believe.

Basically want walk site less 500 away, foot killing me.

So wondering whether okay take OTC painkillers walk there. flu cold back back. Glad I'm tempering body /s 2020 first time never got sick, there's don’t think I’ve cold since october 2019 Folks (generally right center politically) want fired feel he’s making ill informed decisions intentionally undermine trump and/or make money.  entire global economy less valuable one human life. Let collapse Norway we've 13 cases flu since Covid hit. THIRTEEN CASES. really puts perspective absurdly infectious covid is. patent recombinant insulin friends relative complaining ""bad colds"" while. I've lucky wonder bodies overreacting year healthy state. Masks definitely helped allergies.

On hand, think me, staying inside wearing mask time meant times go outdoors (especially without mask) open window whatever, body overreacting allergic reactions worse. Probably also combining dust allergy that's worse usual I'm room often normal. Usually time year allergies gone I'm still Claritin. Cool story bro. sure that? Right? “Don’t worry wearing summer uniforms.” 
“Aren’t wool uniforms short sleeves?” 
“….and 5,6! Horns, up!” US epicenter pandemic now. Since start year pandemic worse countries. exporting vaccines politicians failed get exclusivity deals.

Not true, EU wanted trade vaccines world limited domestic production. good news. speculated time ago. Let's see pans next winter. It’s percentage tests come back positive. Gives better insight level virus circulation rather raw testing numbers.  consider US government rightfully focused vaccinating country first.

Why rightful? obligation solely constituents voted in, world.

That's appalling argument. logic lets fuck rest entire world. use argument global warming fucked behaviour. Fuck carbon emission standards, voters spoke want carbon atmosphere. hyperbole way US voters actually vote on.

It's completely appalling argument. voters always right. appeal authority argument even somehow correct, cares? 

Fucking stupid thing say. Viral fragments also found wastewater Block 501 507. pay get vaccinated ? Pull firing pins guns good job buy leave poorer nations mercy, lol. Let's get overboard ass kissing. Extra filtrations cleaning systems duct work cause increase pressure drop therefore reduce efficiency hvac equipment. Stand-alone air cleaning equipment space work air doesn’t move predictable way open space rendering less effective. Improving ventilation using proper controls sequences yield highest efficiency hvac equipment. seem fair trade me, I'll keep flu thank you, take back covid ever cave appeared from. I'm keeping work home compensation inconvenience caused. get flu shot every year used work retail banking would get flu every year February.

This first full year I've FLU. 
The flu shot kept symptoms mild made fast recovery last March March made first year FLU!

I'm keeping mask forever.  mean forgo seat belt. still things mitigate risks.   number never lie right? could never! here. Got sick hockey game itbwas worst cold I've ever had. Covid hit home country. even made decision travel - without mask. go concert. 

So retrospective, stupid inconsiderate fuck, probably Covid anyways think it. Otherwise spread corona Faroe Islands could probably traced back said concert. Using brain smartass. moron going waste. Exactly. never understood that, always seemed gross me.

You’re saying citizens live abroad risk serious illness death can’t drop everything, leave families, take work several weeks time, twice. 

Classy. Tell you’re American without telling you’re American. Probably corona viruses spiked corona viruses cause 20-30% common colds going away time soon.  British news story British newspaper.

I guarantee hospitals overwhelmed *here*. fewer 1,000 covid patients whole country. Damn mono ain't joke. Keep eye heard idiot nurse radio say vaccine can't considered safe yet ""what 2, 3 4 years later? know future side effects"". then, almost immediately, goes caught Covid 2020 big deal.

March, nurse family doctor mentioned cases flu gone zero. stopped cold everyone wearing mask. Pretty amazing. be, lot friends visited Mexico gotten vaccines. Many bringing teenage kids. US government responsibility citizens first. rest world getting billion dollars free vaccines USis heading recession.

The US even expected major manufacturer vaccines decades. result huge drive step manufacturing US past year, something stressed countries seriously needed well. blame us failures even supposed main source supply chain reduce heating load bringing fresh air ~80% heat exchanger compared exhausting it. current (pre-COVID) designs often worth capital expense, increasing ventilation rate would make worthwhile.

Companies operate within legal ethical boundaries. right order employees get vaccinated COVID? next virus? Where’s limit? want get abortion? people get criticized every time. Dude would living hell me. go clubbing every weekend. fuck still closed there? actually habit using face mask flu season every year. People would always ask ""Are sick?"" bewildered would even bother use one.

I think I've gone 3-4 years without cold got one 2019 COVID earlier year.  think that's fair interpretation.

No. First US never ""bought"" vaccines. forced companies sell nobody else offered money.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Hardly. We're nearly 65% adults vaccinated. doubt we'll hit 70% threshold. And, nothing prevent again, especially different strains. Admittedly, second time usually fatal, assuredly fun. Same. also 4 year old fever runny nose year! glorious kill rate covid plethora sound treatments solid understanding virus. 

The reason reaction covid intense novelty. completely unreasonable put society going virus treat. That's whole principle vaccines getting us pandemic, even people could still catch covid very, would die compared without vaccine. I'll leave post as-is posterity, say people silly geese. least Pfizer Moderna work fine variant. Get one.

Other vaccines likely work too. That’s good all, can’t ignore fact traded near eradication flu virus far contagious deadly flu ever recent times.  flu 20 years. WTF wrong life? [713,873 Excess Deaths since Feb 1, per CDC. Change Dashboard Number Excess Deaths view. always get sick end Disney trip. call Disney Flu. I've read lot zinc past year, think next trip down, I'm going take zinc supplements leading trip. 

They appear kick time, though Pfizer may days quicker.

Otherwise matter much. happy hour Soho last night maskless packed, felt like normal times! Delta B.1.617.2. Kappa B.1.617.1. subtypes called ""Indian variant"". Maybe called Bananas Pyjamas. Nothing wrong that, 2 y/o definitely even close risk covid, bothers people want keep restrictions unvaccinated kids. HS marching band got invited play Army football game November. never grateful heavy band uniforms day. always never fan driving unless time little traffic, matter anymore. People lost sense driving skills past year. People speed excessively super aggressive reason. actually become uber defensive driving time. Always looking situation watching cross lanes going traffic lights.

I remember driving fun kid. stresses out. Let's precise language. seasonal human behavior drives infections seasonal, indoor air quality seasonal. anything innate virus.

In Southwest cases dropped considerably height summer, probably part swamp coolers running require constant air exhaust buildings work properly. lean forward walk Home Depot know swamp coolers blasting 100%. CDC specifically said monitoring it.

They said monitoring non-serious cases. still monitoring serious identifying cases vaccinated people unless hospitalized dead, indicates counting official numbers.

Again, CDC one identifying, states do, report CDC go CDC course 97% cases unvaccinated people identifying, investigating, reporting, monitoring, tracking, scrutinizing, counting data vaccinated people official numbers unless hospitalized died.

As said first comment OP's article local health department rely whatever CDC doing. Good thing don’t pay then

This clickbait people hate US Peru early spike last spring/summer, could adequately plan even best practices established. call summer actually winter there, see seasonal COVID be. Peru lot direct links China may received cases early pandemic. 


They huge inequality lack services parts population/geography able handle massive, ongoing emergency. 


In addition, lockdown measures ineffective, many areas people refrigeration could ""stay home"" would food. lots fresh food Peru go get market. non-lockdown times, country also interconnected people travel far work. 


During first big wave, meant virus well-distributed around country. means last year especially hard like US took spread coasts. also lot information literacy education similar problem India. 


So know they're harder time India, think Peru's story much longer India's advanced stage. There's band camp middle school? It’s shocking people poor understanding facts like excess deaths. Mental health issues huge problem pandemic, stressful event going make worse. It’s like people blaming bandaid cut hurts. don’t get it. need get vaccines move on. Find better mask? getting cheap.

Who making mandatory you? others vaccinated? [Objectively get antibody tests? would curious know. think analogy apply though. Knowing origin pathogen significant impact prevent spread mitigate risk.

If *knew* virus came animal source like bat intervening modification, assume would evolved spread conditions similar roosting bats: Close together, ""indoors"", dark. 

If virus came bats evolved lab, might expect see traits possibly exaggerated changed. Like, might become evolved thrive air conditioned environment rather non-AC'd. might become dependent environment without UV. Stuff like that. need list sources you’re going spread information like this. Understandable.. connection people need, say responsible. equate funds leak, caring labs funded, one could caused global pandemic. get antibody test? get point (and I'm meaning argue you, I'm seeing things play out), said, going fully protected vaccine, what's alternative? can't lock down, mask social distance forever. Vaccines may never fully protect them. I'm trouble grasping context article/post I'm sure we're advocating here. article seems indicate need herd immunity, US we're likely reach level immunity, maybe ever. get next step forward is, feel like I'm kind spinning wheels trying figure out. families last sickness January 2020, sick, pneumonia, 10 year old though dying. think covid. mom sick too, ended ICU oxygen. never able get oxygen died 9 months later age 58. 

We sick since then. can't, that's said ""likely"". Yeah probably misremembered. Past due. Indian variant B.1.617.2 say rare mean RARE, 5 million kids vaccinated &amp; like 215 cases. recovered fine. handful needed hospitalized.  Conspiracy theorist love We're endgame US. Except Florida. Florida cruising along 50 deaths day rolling average. get dirt outside free, thanks. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Health experts recommend sneezing shoulder habit gotta develop kid know sure? thing colds flu's, believe contagious stage start feeling sick like can't go work. that's gonna impact society go back office/gyms/packed busses forth.

Let alone people brok feeling like can't takeoff work, even feel like hell. flu *bad.* Like, 100 degree fever hallucinations bad. Joints muscles hurt like hell felt like death incarnate. Took Tamiflu back feeling normal two days; shit’s miracle drug.  correct, far away 0. elderly vaccined still viral loads higher average younger unvaccinated. Also reduction 1 month post vaccine, seems decrease rather fast. many countries vaccine counts protection 9 months second dose, want enter country restaurant without additional testing  Yup. anti Vax coworker deeply sketched $100 offering work made getting full Vax. spend free time watching YouTube videos, I’m bleeding heart science loving liberal. problem isn’t YouTube. Yeah, happen... LOL  OK, blow candles we’ll eat cake finely misted. coincidence, there's flu strain H3N2 seems eradicated pandemic restrictions

New york tracks reported flu cases. Previous years we'd 20,000 cases week, we're 200. 1/100 previous I'm hoping get 2 year olds Thanksgiving. Never said “just flu” friend, however fully vaccinated. cdc stated free return day day activities without mask, that. provided much evidence post - none. Oh God watching people grocery store standing there, deadass sneezing every single bottle shampoo shelf 1 foot away ask myself, “How live years notice **how** fucking gross people are?”

 Like, thought I’d noticed, really hadn’t grasped depth it. I'm happy subsidizing healthcare folks refused vaccine either (via insurance government assistance). Considering infections subway probably aerosol, I’d give highest percentage kudos masks vaccinations getting rolling Alaska way ahead everyone else vaccination. bad they've fallen behind, guess there's lot vaccine hesitancy. know means? 

It means there's conflict anything actual content experiment?

Potentially, yes. heard ""cherry picking"" data? I'm guessing no, obvious (potential) outcome there's conflict interest. want know stop wearing mask work. loved random dudes tell smile customers recognizing much random places, but...

I'm frankly sick feeling like face trying melt I'm kitchen sweating absolute tits breathing tiny amount recycled air day. I'm 11 hours usually. Definitely anti mask, tired mandatory me. Everyone else take off, dropped hazard pay, so...

(I'm fully vaccinated mobile updated flair) Pretty much. record we’re staunch democrat voters people know absolutely incensed this. One-party rule bad kids, even it’s good party. comment Covid. way implying Covid cold, disproven thousand times would stupid say that. comment people I’ve seen thread saying plan take Covid-type restrictions rest lives avoid cold flu, Covid course something concerned about. Yes heart kind pumping year vaccine time. Seemed stress related disease.  still explain count deaths way. crisis America passing. We’re reaching accountability preventing future pandemics stage. 

You don’t hunt cause fire trying control fire. Doubt it, take, long someone removes it, either due cost believing excessive due declining sicknesses. (Which due new regs) No. thing NYC. time forgot post-subway hand wash pre-COVID, would get sick. I'd always realize moment late. honestly can't wait 3-5 years future brag rub fact serious side effects dumb ass anti-vax faces. Wait I'm getting 5g signal Bill Gates, need buy Microsoft stock now!! /S what, less 2 weeks since stores lifted mask policies? husband retail pharmacist already brought home cold. said several colleagues sick. 

Masks work. didn’t hear context. provide source? ""I thought known LD50 cannabis?""

""there overdosed covid vaccine""  totally agree you. look see usually publications countries delayed second shot. them, first shot means “wow youre vaccinated!” consider second shot almost booster months later. US, language oriented around half-way “fully vaccinated”. different strategies led totally different language, countries delaying second shot, headline appears accurate less click-baity. agree, concerns. settled science there's enough keep studying. question discussion it. Introvert mean anti-social. Plenty introverts (myself included) social, prefer rest mentally ourselves, home, quietly mentally resetting. need 70% vaccinated,despite fear mongering, reinfection rates low vaccines effective known variants, that's fact clickbait headline younger adults vaccinated ones mainly going pubs whatever. surprise it’s spreading. devil's advocate, honesty. downplaying devil's advocacy use actual scientifically proven efficacy numbers?

It's funny mention flu thing, that's exactly point I've used try convince people take shot. worked times.

We're side here. Ugh, [according Nevada 48.38% partially vaccinated, 39.2% fully.

C'mon guys. =( better that. Best way I’ve able describe it:

Does smell? Yes? Probably VOC.

Does smell? No? Probably still VOC.

Natural man made? matter. VOCs common part world. Better chances getting truth bat weird law lists never citations hate them. Often seem completely made up.i suspect woman driver flag requirement one these. times weird reading completely rational law. Like Alaska one may kill moose one several approved methods (gun certain caliber, bow, etc) since airplane pushing one illegal, actually law books reaction airplane pushing problem. times books got ruled unconstitutional official legislative action never taken remove it, law more.

 


These weird laws get repeated bit skepticism. Ooooh yeah, China gonna get right one.  lot families live (accessible boat plane, road out) actually buy yearly insurance life flights. $100 year vs $50k pocket flight emergency. source that? seems to; hell knows believe anymore.  evidence AZ first shot followed Pfizer Moderna provides better protection two AZ shots? That's true. Natural immunity probably protective vaccine immunity, still pretty good, protects people COVID, regardless strain exposed to. also know ""spike"". also dumb word. Thanks sharing, sounds like great time! allergic polyethylene glycol Pfizer Moderna recommended receive J&amp;J. allergic ingredient J&amp;J, get Pfizer. Immunocompromised people encouraged get vaccine stipulation may effective them. Pregnant lactating women recommended get vaccine. exception children 12, cannot think single absolute contraindication getting one vaccines. 

I'm nurse/paramedic administers Covid vaccines. run checklist patient. really Covid related. Uh, that’s literally based study. small draw conclusions. 

And no, don’t admit makes sense restrict travel. Individuals want visit country variants vaccine efficacy fully known, take booster shot vaccine proven work. want circumvent paywall, see: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. people died either old, already severe pre-existing conditions both. easy people care less people died basically people likely die anyway. Yeah let's check someone's arbitrary social score providing help. mercy mistakes. /s People learn put it, like flu, day, polio. Thank info. mainlander, lack ready access medical care even occur me! explains lot. understand 100%, weird happened now, we've calling variants originated quite time. European Union / 325.8 million doses delivered &amp; 260.2 million doses administered, 48% adult EU population received least 1 dose.

That top beyond 300 Millions doses exported worldwide 100 millions exported month. Well. Good. should. got second dose Pfizer vaccine June 2nd around 3:30 PM. Went bed later starting feel sore arm. sleep well night. woke around 6:20 next day headache arm feeling even sore (the latter knew vaccine, former thought time poor sleep). took Tylenol soon after, around 6:50 think, relieve headache. occurred reducing pain headache could hurt immune response way. feel arm sore headache rest day, I'm still worried may build immunity suppose taking Tylenol soon vaccination. worried? PeOpLe DiEd 2-3% people getting covid need hospitalisation.
And plenty people natural antibodies need vaccine immune. US companies manufacture it… mean dose wise, seems states still issues getting enough doses people want them. states able bargain directly pharma companies California buy more.


I wonder matter preparation ability receive properly store doses. Something state takes pandemic seriously would understand prioritize. intend mislead. edited comment.

My point still stands though, even though COVID killed TB. TB deadly disease. admit provides inadequate protection, hence makes sense continue restricting travel. research published two weeks ago also confirms 10% efficacy two doses AZ sources says higher 10%? absolutely - fact feel like I've seen headlines saying suicides business bankruptcies pre-covid years??? testament ability hang on, I'd like think can’t get vaccinated plenty options participate society like take-out, delivery, shop online, outdoor activities even dine outside.  Oh yeah? whose expert? Lying a$$ Fauci?  Sounds like good reason fire unvaccinated. think that's case, result people fixating antibodies rather B T-cells. various studies showing natural immunity persists suggesting immunity one variant applies others too; 


Vaccines seem offer *better* protection, natural immunity still powerful thing. Por que los dos? stupid, also temporary vote remove mask mandate entirely. They're meeting tonight continue process. Essentially, meaningless.

I'd say wish people read article, paywalled. US manufacture anything. Scientists multiple countries developed employees company registered US operating world manufactured it. booked holiday abroad we've cooped inside like soooooooo long now, nobody warned us could sudden changes travel rules!! 

\*shockedpikachu\* /u/DoggyWoggyWoo housemate works hospital says data accurate reflection situation they’re admitting covid-positive people hospital couple days need bit extra oxygen monitoring, whereas first/second waves people would told recover home, beds could saved acutely ill needing ventilation. says number patients ICU still decreasing every that’s take it, idea applies across country!

While that's anecdotal, makes sense me: last year, hospitals overwhelmed *really* sick people, less-ill sent home pulse-oximeters instructions told come back things got worse. normal times, would admitted observation, circumstances last year got sent home.

Things better hospitals now, they're actually able admit patients reluctantly forced send home last year.  Presume single dose effective act accordingly? single shots work better variants work almost all. Ironically enough, Sarah Palin actually said people get vaccine lol. Another excellent point streak broken last week. wife teacher one students bronchitis, passed onto wife me. developed triple whammy upper lower sinus infection bronchitis still antibiotics, however; take day granted. knew head would get sick eventually enjoyed day sick. **no-one** vaccinated, completely agree. place situation anymore. Even low vaccination rates help immensely. told someone days ago wore N95 mow lawn attempted make feel bad it, telling living fear covid. Exactly. definitely people never ever going get it, people fence, adds urgency really sick go prepare food people really better, sorry.  AZ also works fine variant. UK using three vaccines, still spreading like wildfire unvaccinated population. I'm hoping schools (filled unvaccinated kids foreseeable future) close summer mid July dampen spread. would like see UK government consider closing schools early since period really winding school year little learning getting done anyway. COVID like flu measles, though. Getting unlikely protect future variants. We've already seen lots reports reinfections. alaska isolation. covid tearing rural areas lower 48, people go facilities, takes one infected visitor wander local diner every gets taste. that's lot less likely arctic Meanwhile still people shouting death rate 0.05%. I'm even angry anymore, sad. side Biontech funded pretty much Moderna Germany, delivered roughly much US Moderna way world wide. 

And Biontech/Pfizer able deliver based contracts compared J&amp;J delay vaccine 2 months europe due US export ban (they would used US facilities fill&amp;finish import nearly finished vaccine reexport US government refused garantue safety). Also AZ came close fulfilling UK contract severely missing mark everywhere else UK government forced partner 2nd choice company. can't compare philanthropic country entire union countries been, conflating two things spin narrative. union countries going inherently exports.

These non EU exports. yeah can. work industrial ventilation buddy, hell talking about?  imagine it'll take time people readjust. Atleast things getting better.  1) 10% true

2) studies needed define efficacy 

3) AZ immunized people take mRNA booster shot able travel countries 50% vaccine evading mutations (less 50% efficacy) lol sorry can't spread disease?? know, make good point. on, need see GP reason, I'm wearing damn mask bringing hand sanitizer too.

I actually see masks still sold bought reason. Wait - tell nasal sprays (I’m also pretty new allergies). I’ve using Flonase go outside, every day

Also sporadically using neti pot  common flu come back really shock people. completely non existent year That's silly, everyone brain. Viral mutations also still exist. yes. humidity levels major factor covid transmission. established early pandemic. indoor humidity dramatically affected outdoor temperature. Good thing don’t pay then

Correct, younger people pay medicare. fuck happening? 

I wanna go moose drop! hope called Loose Moose. 

Do serve goulash? That’s right! Hi Australia!!!
We essentially immunity thanks success keeping covid bay, it’s banging doors sneaking international borders, lockdowns going keep us safe much longer vaccination roll remarkably slow. Good thing boomers gave universal healthcare. Hmmmmm.... sort common denominator two groups?  Tell new Variants formed South America. Coming US soon! vaccines likely work too.

Other vaccines start less effective precisely makes things headache. Morbid obesity disease. Let's continue road we'll end subsidizing healthcare healthy people.  whole lab leak development EXACTLY shouldn’t allowing tech companies like Twitter Facebook “ban misinformation”. year ago, anyone talking lab leak would’ve (and probably were) silenced. 

They “for science” much fits science politics aligns with. It’s sad. That’s bullshit. Norway manufactured them, they’re theirs. case US did. It’s start, least US isn’t asking nations concessions like Russia China been. They’re also free. Russia China charged. covid join frat/sorority? Wow great story!!!  brain function loss

Can't lose never first place guess? rest us wear masks forever protect science shows low risk spreading covid vaccinated? AZ vaccine (UK's common one) 10% effective SA variant. Likely need year, that. bet 3-5 year schedule. server bartender, work cash daily. Miss 2 days, 300 bucks. sick time. Cover shift get fired. Everyone works sick.  Wtf? responsible people got vaccinated punished one coworker dumb so? way around. one person wearing mask would basically dunce cap would hopefully good motivation get vaccinated. I’m scheduled go back office end month thank goodness state doesn’t rule like this. don’t mind wearing mask 20 minutes store whatever wearing one 8 hours straight would pretty awful. Props essential workers whole time. Time reward getting vaccinated letting ditch masks. vaccinated point participating society risk. Well, one, everyone *can be* vaccinated. wear masks forever? Here's hoping one Brisbane Flu. nasty strain   already knew things. came forefront. doubt anything done though. Japan limited supplies (compared countries mentioned), internal distribution strategy. We’re talking countries without enough food. know say right way. Distributing jabs right way. 

But example see Belgium cases, hospitalisation deaths free fall. 52% adults received 1st dose, 25% received second dose. working too.

The bad strategy like Japan initially (whatever reasons were) basically anything weeks. prioritising first doses second doses, different strategy, especially better worse. pros cons. I'll try day off. mindset fascinates I'm gonna continue wearing masks I'm sick I'm busy environment. comfi ones makes keep healthy I'm it. I've one cold since pandemic started, that's it. Here's taking 1 UV light month stop Corona virus.

I'm sure doctor, learned person told this. Yup. Hopefully it’ll kill me. blame fact US pays much healthcare rest world. Pharmaceutical companies earn way money need R&amp;D. US would regulate gigantic amount advertisements bonuses CEOs, would already help quite lot. want work anymore. Future solution - wear mask public transit sanitize hands. mask probably much socially acceptable long time. Yes, certainly: shows 7-dsy rolling averages daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people US Netherlands.  Same. keep getting pressure buildup it’s always forgot use flonase. goes away couple hours taking it. “I sick allergic?” assessment nice.    India faults least big domestic producer drugs medicine vaccines. Oh screw calculated decision made experts based hundreds years collective knowledge vaccines immunity. Canada good reason think COVID vaccines would respond like vaccines. Luck played minor role.   Mono last several weeks several months. Definitely go see Dr. Good luck Strep painful. kids refused eat hurt bad. lots popsicles antibiotics kicked in. RIP flu strains Make sure it’s N95. Cloth masks provide little-to-no protection person wearing them. protect others though, feel like you’re getting sick, definitely good idea wear one. Wool biggest issue, wool breathes, one enjoys standing sun heat pants coats.  Christmas 2019 couldn’t find local pharmacy. called several falling asleep staying like week.  True, think that. Maybe make chips smaller size, removing need double dip entirely. break chip half dip. long mono last? might developing something. sure may also concussion recently. I'm feeling million different things lol  YEP, got VILEST case strep burned it’s way household week daughter started preschool again. Man BAD. Brown fungus?  heard influenza expert radio Australia last week. started flu season here.
She said 2 years ago time year Australia recorded 16,000 cumulative cases confirmed flu.
Last year (2 months COVID lockdown)? 1,500 cases
This year? 12. 12 flu cases whole Australia. Amazing.  suddenly want call parents thank years club sports. top school sports park &amp; rec. stuff. recently realized weren’t always complaining broke poor-poor. supportive parent poor. 

I call, 2:54 am. fingers still touch side goes dip getting much germs. March 2019 quit smoking. covid, haven’t sick two years. 


It’s neat. immune system realise? people wear n95 masks completely protected. They're inexpensive widely available. little bit common cold circulating Finland. Rhino adenoviruses suspected. Rhinovirus care much hand true  talking people cant get medical reasons.

Eg. People cancer known serious allergy It’s SF. expect??? yet many don’t care whatsoever. Based much dirty money tamiflu/Oseltamivir ever worked? Like legit actually done anything?  Well...yeah...but, FREE vaccines also unavailable people. So, kind moot. supply constraints ease, change future. point time, 18-44 year olds pay want vaccine. Completely agree. We're point choose get vaccinated get sick.. well, sorry stupid.  Polyethylene glycol (Pfizer) anaphylaxis, could potentially small number cases lead cardiomyopathy. 

Could PEG theoretically lead myocarditis? obvious agent? That's straight incorrect. sources? See data [from travelling tabby 2x start month.

Take look hospitalisations per age group. compare last week total whole pandemic. cases younger people now, different before. ICU numbers aren’t rising much either (yet, hopefully stays way).  And? Health care costs money. ICU, expensive equipment clinical staff keeping alive. can't free.

Medicare covers costs what's issue?  Patent waivers nothing US refusing allow export finished vaccines produced US soil countries signed contracts vaccine companies paid doses 20-something American living UK, worrisome. UK's vaccine rollout wonderfully successful, think prioritization age/vulnerability clearly right idea. quite frustrating desperately want vaccine wait indefinitely everyone know back States already vaccinated months already.

Young people largest vectors disease, India variant seem ripping areas, particularly lot students. would hate made way contract COVID month I'm eligible vaccine. something I've paid lot attention data myself, know UK increasing time shots also gave approval mix vaccines; like maybe first shot AstraZeneca second Moderna. know many people actually got mixed shots, got extended intervals, extended intervals were, know things UK said fine.

While think we're getting data support ""fully vaccinated, schedule, same-vaccine"" effectiveness, I'm sure similar data UK's rather unique approach. seems contradictory. virus isn’t running rampant amongst unvaccinated 70% people vaccinated. It’s exponentially decaying, far least.  **Main points**

- 2 May 2021, estimated 1.0 million people living private households UK (1.6%) experiencing self-reported long COVID (symptoms persisting four weeks first suspected coronavirus (COVID-19) infection explained something else).


- estimates presented analysis relate self-reported long COVID, experienced study participants responded representative survey, rather clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 post-COVID-19 syndrome full population.


- people self-reported long COVID, 869,000 first (or suspected had) COVID-19 least 12 weeks previously, 376,000 first (or suspected had) COVID-19 least one year previously.
Self-reported long COVID symptoms adversely affecting day-to-day activities 650,000 people, 192,000 individuals reporting ability undertake day-to-day activities limited lot.


- Fatigue common symptom reported part individuals' experience long COVID (547,000 people), followed shortness breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000), difficulty concentrating (285,000).


- proportion UK population, prevalence self-reported long COVID greatest people aged 35 69 years, females, living deprived areas, working health social care, another activity-limiting health condition disability; prevalence lowest people Asian ethnic background.


- raised prevalence self-reported long COVID among health social care workers compared sectors largely explained (non-employment) socio-demographic characteristics risk initial infection. cite claim ""natural immunity robust vaccines""? Honestly looking good sources that. Ive got 2 young children good ol school still open didnt let year. Actually sick right lol hahaha :D simple patent waiver either though. likely foreign manufacturing facilities would need trained creation mRNA vaccines production facilities may need retooled accommodate different production process. Yea it’s super unlikely. would probably involve military removal CCP power. Champions League final gone. let people take wonderful lucre abroad now? There’s literally email March 11 2020 virus created… proper thing get doses Ok gerne, dann einfach nach schiefer Nasenscheidewand, vergrößerten Nasenmuscheln und chronischer Nasennenbenhöhlenentzündung googeln :) meant “dangerous” society, individuals. That’s didn’t say deadly. problem antibodies don’t know long effective variants. immunity unpredictable far less effective vaccines. 

So individuals would covid every year, others every two, others every 3 6 months, others get another illness wipes immune system square zero. 

It’s absurd play Russian roulette vaccine much much better protection It’s likely due fact 80 percent deaths 65. It’s tragic, people aren’t surprised old people die. see you’re saying. used “dangerous” stand-in total severity infectivity anything else causes problems.  Honestly, we're getting close point people vaccinated probably be. People still abstaining probably lack access (might true Alaska, though. I'm expert)

We continue trying get vaccine everyone wants one, convince others get one, prepared try track clusters community spread places vaccine rates low, especially tracking super spreaders, they'll probably much spread comes thought first, seeing delta variant used two article titles, already becoming lot familiar.  So, obviously meat consumption (especially developed world) meat consumption much part capitalist consumer culture unhealthy overconsumption promoted segments market promoted sale food. Think fast food commercials encourage upsize etc. said agreement would better people moved plant based diets. would explain hospitalization, explain rising cases rising positive test %.

The issue positive case numbers cases positive sense. could entirely asymptomatic got tested came contact someone idea infected; conversely could also hours death. definitely indicator meaning, there's range contexts behind positive result. Gotcha 👍 Well course one dose better nothing. two doses necessary clamp infections since one dose 33% effective neutralization. Got spicy quotes? said ""refused"" unvaccinated. People can't get vaccines real victims anti-vaxxers.

I know enforcement always hard, I'm advocating implemented rules. point anybody saying personal choice there's harm wrong, public health matter also economically. Anti-vaxxers free-loaders. Honestly, there's little evidence support either theory unlikely ever be. can't extrapolate. There's many unknowns, like level antibodies sufficient prevent infection.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Precisely. Yeah, shit younger people admitted hospital March, basically old people getting infected anymore. point actual number people hospitals really get control, law percentages remaining unvaccinated population made hospital admissions.

Doug Ford's whole ""this virus killing younger"" line grade fear mongering basis science statistical evidence. Put t-shirt, amirite!? (X) Doubt aren’t talking deaths, I’m talking fourth wave.

Also know enough even younger people Covid develop bad outcomes lingering symptoms we’d like avoid. Younger people need second doses. It’s fact. exactly, new york earlier california still worst thing is, evenly distributed. Elderly people saw half friends die. Oh, definitely!  Got one. comment headline every UK newspaper. constant doomsaying wearying. get doses,
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine elicits weaker antibody response Delta variant, UK study finds
The emerging data researchers Francis Crick Institute UCLH Biomedical Research Centre shows decreased vaccination effectiveness, especially first shot, variant first identified India. Scientists study conclude second doses must delivered quickly vulnerable members population might need booster shot end 2021. study also says ""**a single dose might still afford considerably protection vaccination.""** bill Medicare paid, seniors themselves, everyone jumps America bad bandwagon.  Almost like didn’t read Fauci’s emails? Hi there. Please [modmail would like included [studies good thing vulnerable received first dose received second dose, it? Thank you. isn’t actually friend. flights booked 15th June. He’s coming meet LA. realized might allowed in. airline hasn’t said anything him. He’s Pakistani National studying UK. valid tourist visa. Thank you! (Edit: Stalked post history. Danke) Hay fever time full swing, maybe people wearing masks outdoors due hayfever. lowest vaccinated states Bible belt. Can't say I'm surprised. get released congress time Trump's tax returns.  purposeful, yes. accidental, would lot people culpable, including Americans NIH.

We would see major reckoning research conducted, would impact watergate level trust government shift, downward. Vaccine hesitancy, like mentally inept conspiracy theory toting moronic fucks leave people risk death ignorance. reply appears many threads. exception children 12 (who aren’t really danger), one really point people can’t get vaccine. It’s tiny microcosm people it’s worth basing public policy decisions them. even need to, simply hide behind patient confidentiality. China could easily argue release using America's right privacy it. 

There real legitimate reasons keep people's record private despite are, HIV status. illegal HIV want rest world know, look Charlie Sheen news broke HIV status.

What would happen China rest world wanted Fauci's medical records? Would happy release everyone see?  believe virologists, can't. sort frankly unhelpful (to public mean) epidemiolocal numberwanking we've seen since beginning. Fortunately Ferguson's dire predictions last year wrong - hopefully too. least lower end. mention 30-100% fucking massive margin. ""You may may fucked"" basically he's saying. One dose isn’t effective enough Indian variant. Way people need two, another wave. Seriously bs metrics. population New York State fully vaccinated 44%. Herd immunity doesn’t decide 18 isn’t. 

You’re using dumb metrics fake result don’t have. SARS deadly coronavirus contained far know wiped high hospitalization rates limited spread. COVID, less deadly, reached pandemic proportions precisely many infected faced mild/asymptomatic illness. I’ve seen keep sinopharm 2nd doses people get large jump effectiveness 2nd dose. AZ think you’d safe giving people first doses many people possible. Canada waiting give AZ 2nd doses believe 4 months seems going well. 

Chile hand seems like would better making sure inoculated person got 2 doses sinopharm. There’s lot various factors AZ seems effective longer month whereas sinopharm really seems lot better 2nd dose. 

Logistically it’s annoying different things different vaccines trends studies seem indicate way. might really hard organize way government person getting vaccine try schedule appointments mind possible. know lot people don’t luxury choose sinopharm seems work amazing amount better second dose. Okay, wow, never even *considered* this. Thank you, really helps understand differing articles better! One dose isn’t effective new variants  Gah! I'm sorry. I've seen videos, terrifying. think makes sense wary investing billions world-class vaccine roll-out pissed away variant. 

We'll wait see ideally mortality rate much lower given vulnerable people vaccinated now.   don’t see marginally better. Free strings attached much better. There’s bound extra stubborn people there, work mask mandate singled non-vaccinated people, sudden weren’t jabbed showed first dose card. works incentive  would explain hospitalization, explain rising cases rising positive test %. data also shows cases strongly clustered people age 45. age group much lower vaccination rates, lot people vaccinated 1 shot. may combination infectious variant spreading still-unvaccinated population, AZ vaccine they're primarily using maybe effective (at least variant) 1 dose.

They people 65 completed 2-doses vaccination, accordingly cases among people 65 up. 45-64 age group much higher levels cases older group, though still fewer cases 25-44. 45-64 age group LARGE majorities 1 shot, still whole lot people second dose. mean? Almost every day Reddit find mention EDS find another zebra given subreddit. It’s crazy. We’re everywhere. watched Billie Eilish docu night like oh, too? (She didn’t say diagnosed EDS seems quite likely) course side. change fact feel necessary correct someone said pretty vague ultimately accurate statement. need it. 


America serious problem people trusting vaccines guy chimes ""Well people still die"". hell helping anyone? least source reliable document outlines problems study.  According CDC excess death numbers add 580,751-713,873 number. Call round 1.2 Million. lay number feet GOP actively incompetent handling pandemic. Yeah Covid hit sweet spot somewhat deadly infectious time kill enough spread others die host. *As God witness, thought moose could fly*  Unfortunately it’s going tough convince people (and even governments) keep adhering restrictions masking “should” fine one dose... variant gets foothold, time that’s picked testing may late. Canada already people agitating go back normal half populations one dose. 0 states 70% ages people died unit? hospitalisations tell want situation like present day two weeks ago. didn’t read whole post you? guess bit explicit choice adults. small percentage. media overinflated lot headlines. tried wearing mask sick times pandemic, people responded hostility ejection. covering face considered socially deviant threatening, people inclined ignore ill suddenly sit focus call attention mask. ""If sick enough need wear mask, can't leave immediately."" Living fear breakthrough case like wearing raincoat house case roof massive leak  Hospitalisations increasing Scotland. Anyone know what's New Hampshire graph? They're showing devaccinations. CA seeing surge cases like UK seeing. fact CA still dropping cases among one lowest rates cases country. zero reason rollback reopening, least far virus growth concerned. lung transplant might well counted death. 
Your life quality drops nothing chances surviving past five years rather low. 
I’m glad made w/o getting sick came end good shape! covid choice

Uh tell two year old. 70% number would represent people ages 18+, people 18. meant change? think simple ""just get it."" wonder many died didn’t know treat correctly first place rather Covid. Many people ventilated probably shouldn’t been. Also many died waited long treatment. Also lack mask wearing beginning. think breakdown come future. Also meme vaccine “rushed” wrong. They’ve studying kill political career. people thought guy could future presidential candidate lol. french quarter definitely builds something 😭😂 agree, logic also dictates stop putting tax dollars treating people 200 pounds overweight keep eating, despite knowing full well healthy. Smokers would denied lung cancer treatment. Well precovid, different rules different world people like focus mortality rate?

What people (including kids) long covid? heart, brain and/or lung damage?

If kids get damage realize long would live that? Nah got French Quarter immunity need /s neighbor MS wheelchair. got shot January. remove requirement parent/guardian consent vaccine, teens able get own. know there's least something manual going know times large labs/groups labs miss reporting deadlines. hadn’t heard explanation impression could mutate deadly form. actually makes reopening processes america seem make sense. Really felt like gamble. Good strawman bossman, never said I'm 'arguing second doses' insinuate that. wave infections result health care service unable operate warrant continuation domestic restrictions. Argue point made and, argue fictitious strawman want people disagree be. clear, entitled make healthcare decisions country. That's Supreme Court said abortion must legal. ""I want vaccine."" part larger issue. 

 think even would agree company can't tell workers get get abortion, obviously line somewhere. person wrote article stated fact subset data. imply anything Florida’s intentions respect entire dataset. 

If Florida intended publish weekly reports data, reasonable believe would said today ended daily reports. 

The Tampa Bay Times exactly changed reporting last week. guess you’ll ask weather girls. Nobody falling scare tactics

Most states falling science. It’s never gonna end it. It’s time that’s issue, months protection drop 33% based studies booster would needed people end year, based vaccines tested time study tell.

Edit: 33% current vaccine offers levels protection. point vaccinated get covid sympathy you, care man opinion, stand Fully vaccinated doesn’t mean 100% protection infection transmission susceptibles. UK higher rate overall almost one 12-24 age bracket (primarily) less effective vaccine. US, vaccine rates highest amongst elderly still quite high among kids/young adults. large portion new cases UK among youngest cohort. Sounds like BS me.  Maybe 28 40 said would quit, quit reasons addition vaccine, 3/4ths people quit sort thing. Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee Wyoming among states lowest vaccination rates. Probably export ban masks ran companies sold highest bidder around world. good way add fuel recall may unite behind effort getting out. lot Democrats sick also. like Jesus hold beer I’m surprised NY state isn’t list, least Tri-State metro area, considering near apocalypse almost became little year ago... gives fuck doctors say get yearly booster? 

What complete baby something? supposed health community. 

It’s fucking hard. natural immunity anything either. Let’s count people already sick keep seeing CA 70% stuff saying CA ~54%

Which it? want know number accurate seems implied they'll going weekly reports statewide data, can't say I'm expert FL releases data. point daily reports make sense forever, seems reasonable talk reducing frequency. Florida truly believed approach, would allow everyone see two full weeks data post Memorial Day.

Resorting mass ignorance speaks volumes. see ludicrous display last night? weed smell thing truly fucked sad way poorly educated people punish poor people. 

I’m okay expected freedom boarding aircraft basically giant weapons.

I think people continue wearing masks public year vaccination nothing vaccine. vaccines require person's immune system able react generate response. That's anyway true. lie? concerns cell phones 90s.

No didn't. *Morons* did... still do. Surely madness restrict vaccine Chile numbers spiking vast safety data UK EU review? Earth 1/3 US going infected time? would mean every single unvaccinated person virus time.

I don’t understand you’re arguing? vaccines completely novel virus, 10% US population ever got infected. 10% once, 10% entire year. good scenario 30% US Covid exact time?  Well, using modern database tech would added overhead reporting. done hand sure, want minimize that. don't. really don't. 

I still see parrot ""98% people survive!"" ""they mark covid deaths!"" bullshit time. people whose bodies ravaged covid recovering. people seem think recover covid like common cold: straight back pre-sick state. everyone does. reach immunity hard way, easy way. places already contagious variants. mention notable ones, it’s done yet either. far, vaccines good variants, don’t want leave door wide open either. corrected though? scientists themselves, owing self-correcting process science. good story, shows confidence scientists scientific conclusions since they're constantly going conclusions refining finding better answers solutions. We'll get Cena LeBron ask, might two Americans pull there.  fact scenario come issue every single non vaccinated person entire country got Covid overnight shows much non issue is. Considering looking like UK's reopening 21st looking like delayed, despite much higher vaccination rate, surprise? Infected mean hospitalised though. Biggest reason I’m still masking outside. Makes tremendous difference allergies. Right, I’m fine, assholes put immunocompromised mother risk. don’t want hang anyone isn’t vaxed. Specifically man mentioned, well writer article, one scientist references article loudest proponents demonizing skepticism swaying beliefs. Information gathered one major conflict interest also deployed censor internet.

I acknowledge science process wider public may privy may easily misunderstood, say, behavior supposedly impartial, honest, professional experts really eye-opening. Usually scientists work come collective consensus, dissent aired, there's freedom explore. seems clearly working backwards already agreed upon position creating regressive cult-like atmosphere dissent tolerated. sure could damaging process science that. guess false impression experts honest levelheaded originally thought... Medicare pays 80% medical nothing prescriptions unless one pays plan. everyone afford supplemental plans either. headline, that's 4k out-of-pocket, plus meds. available? article makes reference weekly long-term care data, general data. place tracks independently Florida reporting it?  Ultra nationalist morons around globe ruined science, freaking scientific question turned stupid political football. Hospitals aren’t going overwhelmed again. laughably far realm possibility. here. I’m pretty much bound get sick every year 2020 exception. Well can't US lift export ban let free market decide doses go.  That's one thing people keep forgetting. Surviving covid half battle, damage sometimes causes insane. People needed double lung transplants.

All ""but death rate low!"" people clearly know that! Try turkeys next time.  easy someone made lame comment every thread related topic since border closed. Myocarditis kill you. talking about.  cares won’t get sick I'm sure voted. guess reddit hates people high medical bills. Live learn. something free another nation hopes seeing favorable future asking nation cut ties Taiwan. fact, situation described strings attached all, sort like wrote earlier. actually agree me, don’t realized. That’s fucking hilarious. I’m going go get drunk now. Unless vaccinated kids 12. matters much you. think idea Prof masks work. issue donating/selling. money buy vaccines, US largely prevented vaccines sold. EU China parts Russia one providing available doses even donated. 

The problem really available supplies, saying 'well give money people buy' hoarding vaccines really good answer. 

Ideally, third-world countries get plenty donations unfortunately, attention sent SEA &amp; Latin America China US competition African states getting short end stick.  I'm advocating lab-leak theory, That's literally like suggesting millions people use bleach every day, find chlorine river, assume came people, chlorine factory hundred workers.
 
The research goes lab, including increase function experimentation raises odds considerably. “There types immunity may provide protection. Immune cells known cells may play role ability immune system protect us COVID-19."" cells known cells may play role ability immune system protect us COVID-19."" suddenly retracting June 15 reopening, spells disaster ahead. Newsom promised date back April. Venues making preparations reopen full near-full capacity. what? article says guidelines prior June 15. exactly getting guidelines? tier system remaining place? You’re spot on. don’t know talking about. Liars throwing shit wall hoping sticks. excess vaccines US government ordered US companies. No, flies around Arizona Sundays. Stomach bugs tend noroviruses (even though call ""stomach flu""), extremely easy transmit via surfaces, human human contact, extremely contagious (which tear groups people almost everyone goes days). 

All covid-inspired sanitizing done much prevent covid transmission (which seem much surface involvement) definitely contributed reducing norovirus case numbers dramatically. correct: flu spreads sypmtomatic?

note: honest question. curious would thing....  I'm due get 2nd pfizer shot days, keep hearing studies showing efficacy may improve delaying 2nd shot. Considering pushing couple weeks. thoughts? common cold cause concern. zero exposure pathogens constantly nuking good bacteria skin actually probably bad you. wife swears wearing mask helped allergies. Except there's like what, 200 variations common cold? There's effort create universal common cold vaccine, obviously tricky. people suck, really can't blame flu. Flu lots lots animal reservoirs (birds pigs main ones), really nasty strains tend develop jumping humans. long animals, zoonotic diseases. animals, ecosystem collapse, would far worse us (and life planet) number zoonotic diseases, focus preventing treating zoonotic diseases limiting spread serious ones much possible.

There reasons very, diseases ever eradicated fully ever be, human behavior. liked old ones - killed us slower across multiple cycles instead current style hit run flu takes fronts - personal, family work. give back extinct ones shove new improved flu window. 70% adults high school kids.  already get paycheck come work. pay ""get vaccinated enjoy looking job"" Cries Minnesota Weird rarely ever got sick too! haven’t sick I’m two years ans cold hell Cool, stop wearing masks never congestion again! see us making wider bubble short/mid term - like us/Cooks - eventually I'm guessing we'll us/Aus/most pacific maybe anyone outside would MIQ get 'inside' big bubble. mean, need make money, quarantining isn’t possible many people. 5G towers. Duh! Suddenly I'm remembering HVAC complaints entire team lodged fall '19 brushed ignored 🙄 thankful obnoxious us working home (and I'm going back) though definitely mid-March relented Lol downvoted thought out. everyone Hawaii locked 30 days, tracked every case followed quarantine, Covid would effectively eliminated.

Since never actually happened, follows logically incorrect easy is. ignoring truth. numbers lie. I'm gonna sit say wearing mask favorite thing, sick since early winter 2020 fantastic. wish wearing mask cold/cough/etc became norm, sadly not. America least mask wearing politicized get. 

Sigh. think many endemic diseases could reduced eradicated wearing masks. still plan mask high-risk cold/flu months I'm public group people. course continue enhanced sanitation measures. fucking hate getting colds passion.  Follow thought out. everyone Hawaii locked 30 days, tracked every case followed quarantine, Covid would effectively eliminated. locking airports testing, fairly easy see long would take track down. compare concept would like NYC Chicago.
Pandemics categoricaly easier control islands. could kid still underlying cold kicked bronchitis first place. They’re little germ factories. Oooh know talking viral agent contagious ? piece paper that's verifiable, seems standard proof vastly different. use proof supposed produce standard. Maybe US - EU travels postponed next year see situation next year. one surprised this. Even though virus low levels, large cohort people social big vectors (20-29) unvaccinated assume back close normal social activity level. limited impacts due age vaccination status vulnerable. also reverse start vaccinating people. still releasing weekly reports, means 7 day averages shouldnt change, dailies drop 0 sudden covid icu travel nursing. Looks like I'll enjoying future work deep south. “That's like putting whole mouth right dip! on, take chip, take one dip end it!”  discredit people developed blood clots vaccinated. I've seen cases personally. headache, chest pains 2 days after. lift am.......I super protected. one happy Covid happened people died. 

It's called finding silver lining, expanding knowledge viruses spread.  really miracle medicine. Disingenuous compare India (12% least 1 dose) USA (over 50%) Canada (60%) Really?? Damn, must something else too. sure- especially pediatric waiting rooms Tell buy annuity after-tax winnings get much $300/month guaranteed life, probably several thousand depending age. lose security guaranteed income. Yes. saves one life. took less 30 seconds collect masks throw garbage. guess qualify ""taking time"" though. Yeah no.  Covid leads ARDS. ARDS leads hypoxia. Hypoxia leads death. COVID contagious.

Blood clots contagious.

Idk getting downvoted oblivion, know 2 people got covid twice 2nd time always much worse. 1 intubed. Plummeting 400-500 deaths per day. That’s still pretty fucking bad country 33 million people. downvoted made assertion evidence means back up. People know sky blue. People absolutely know getting infected UK variant sufficient protection Indian variant Indian variant's ability evade immunity.

It's like posted blue sky actually tiny luminescent dragons complained people downvoted without alternate evidence. entire post baseless. need evidence write completely baseless assertions, move on. remember hearing someone say exactly words forum india two months ago - 'covid burnt now' - look happened May. wrong make sure people fully vaccinated - right passport - let in? can't wait 90% canadians fully vaccinated? would really hate see India happen unvaccinated un-fully vaccinated.. clarify, banning banning misinformation? proof. want accept it.

But yeah, keep staying shut. That's gonna wonders business. provided zero additional suggestions. laissez les ventilateurs rouler expect happen again, would expect developed countries’ numbers would closer real number. said, believe won’t know true number many years even we’ll rely estimates. 

What’s really sad Peru still grip thing. They’ve got 33M people losing 400-500 per day. per capita terms that’s like US losing 4K-5K people per day. absolute peak! states lowest vaccination rates: ""Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee Wyoming..""

This list surprise least. saying gave Anchorage? maybe [vaccine might actually something end May, enough vaccine every Alaskan get vaccinated who’s 16 above,” Dr. Anne Zink, state’s chief medical officer said public information call.  vaccination rates across state varied widely communities, data state showed — officials worried vaccine hesitancy communities could prevent life going back normal quickly.   latest data federal Centers Disease Control Prevention showed Alaska, No. 1 vaccinations per capita U.S., fallen No. 13.  least five boroughs reached coverage rates 70% eligible population Wednesday, communities showing much lower rates.In Matanuska-Susitna Borough, 32% eligible population received dose, Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, 28% had.

It's distribution problem. :D. really, 2 kids generations would slowly lower population. clear advocate full vaccination, growing evidence places higher vaccination rate, Israel, shows even amongst breakthrough cases, transmission occuring manner concerning.

And logical too. vaccines reduce symptom severity viral load. Less coughing, etc less virus body less pass on. ""Do know many ppl die Flu compared COVID?!"" feel well want people think, would keep releasing numbers. would pumping information keep trying justify approach. Nunavut Canada went largest COVID free place awful outbreaks. That's far sparser Alaska though average living conditions lot worse.  “If?”

Let’s avoid sensational language like that, please. Great, fuel nutters, regardless whats released. children completely free colds, coughs, runny noses, head lice etc. total lockdown. soon nurseries schools reopened though constant festival sickness (including Covid caught toddler nursery teacher tested positive). US also donating BioNTech? Unfortunately Canada lot remote communities hardest hit. First Nation communities incredibly social, multi-generational homes, COVID spreads like wildfire situations.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Peer pressure remarkably powerful thing. Office gossip two hold outs making 60 employees still wear masks going vicious. Why? 
Do masks take freedom?  Ridiculous, Pfizer’s vaccine 80% effective Delta others(Moderna JNJ) probably around same. that’s low Influenza vaccines longer used. 

There’s doubt it’ll take long time world get vaccinated covid still around years now, pandemic subsiding. fact people got vaccines unlikely get Covid die it. else need? people dying US anti-vaxxers.

So motive doctors die... Funny dead anti-vaxxers worry vaccines ever. good them.  [Additional statistics found (it bit slower update though, numbers slightly outdated)

* week 17 onwards 20m doses administered per week. roughly 3m doses per day, 0.7 doses per 100 inhabitants day.
* vast majority new doses Pfizer/BioNTech, rest relatively even mix AstraZeneca, Moderna Janssen (J&amp;J).
* 80% 70+ age group received least one dose. Indian variant? Given storage handling requirements, I'm sure challenge. 

Nah, cold week eight good sled dogs need. want American-donated vaccine? BionTech probably best vaccine now. agree. Last time checked Alabama almost bottom. Thank God Mississippi, right? think story also got buy t-shirt. kids 2 4 covid hit Northern Europe. Every week sick child then, one us try work home minding kid. 
Lockdown strikes daycare reopened much smaller group focus hand wash, sanitizing toys etc. 
In year 1 kid threw got harmless cough around December! That's true, get impression suddenly going stop looking them. Hopefully learned trick two last 16 months.  Yeah bad. sad thing is, UK mini Covid wave done, people go next country 1% rise cases begin doomsday scenarios, again, people believe them. Except totally replace masks! punishing told got vaccines. Ummm...what? evidence would like besides fact came across post, multiple downvotes single response?

If somebody makes post says sky blue, someone else chooses downvote it, one would think would take moment offer something way believe actually green. US enough ICU capacity handle 0.03% population. 30 beds per 100k people ample virtually every circumstance except pandemic. So, majority smart medical decisions, care well-being others. Can't say so-called pro-life Bible thumpers. 

*shock* Similarly others, vaccinated allowed make choices wear mask. fact point believe everyone able make choice. I’m totally fine folks making choice regarding vaccine also willingly taking risk it’s longer anyone’s obligation protect get chance go questions, please get free ask 👍 Well proof entrance mind. I'm clear people downvoting, stand opinions.

As I've posted another response, I'm partially vaccinated (1 dose AZ) regular blood tests part ONS study, currently antibodies showing. think perfectly reasonable wait data deciding appropriate travel internationally pleasure. winners get notified? charge would  Yukon also 70% people (pop ~35k) living one city - Whitehorse (pop ~25k). 1. dont think immuno compromised automatically implies vaccines ineffective. may generate lower immunity response susceptible testing positive vaccination dint think vaccines ineffective lot cases. immuno compromised relative got covid 1 month second dose AZ vaccine high outbreak country. didnt go hospital-it ended like severe viral infection recovered week. vaccine actually saved her
2. `part unlucky 5% people get COVID despite vaccinated.`

Where getting number from? 95% efficacy doesnt mean 5% automatically get covid vaccination. get part trouble understanding: *there option American travellers internationally standard digital certificate PCR test much ""your word""*. looks like creepy game show host CNN says it, must true. Unless you’re Oregon California, respectively: 

-following mostly arbitrary metrics ignoring science, says vaccinated people safe
-keeping masks long without riots

Time return normal. one remember higher O2 percentage air. CO2 increase mentioned increase side effect lowering O2 ratio air. directly CO2 trace compounds.

But tried googling bit find anymore :/ Free diabetes jackhole employees unvaccinated tune almost 50 percent them. makes think old co-worker swore killing missing year building immunity.  I'm original poster Novavax's placebo group trial South Africa 30 percent participants positive antibodies showing previous infection reinfection rates similar participants previous infection. initial 60 days follow-up placebo group, preliminary incidence Covid-19 observed among participants seronegative baseline (5.3%; 95% CI, 4.3 6.6), included 33 mild 47 moderate cases among 1516 participants, similar incidence among seropositive participants (5.2%; 95% CI, 3.6 7.2), included 14 mild 21 moderate cases among 674 participants (Figure vaccine trial’s placebo group, people prior coronavirus infections appeared likely get sick people without them, meaning weren’t fully protected B.1.351 variant swiftly become dominant South Africa."" evidence wasn't?

There large bat populations around Wuhan, two virology labs known work bat coronaviruses. Canadian Territories Yukon NWT **64%** **whole population** one dose (and 50% fully vaccinated). u know...fire Canada, moved strict age-based requirements indicator also targeting hotspots seems mitigated 3rd wave lot areas. 

Still though, something like 4% fully vaccinated currently 70% 1st dose. inaccurate descriptor?? Definitely. 👍

I balance chocolate cake w milkshakes! 😁

Clinton used balance jogs w McD's Big Mac's! 🤣

I balance forceful statements w hypocrisy actions! No, wait... thats political balance!

Yes, balanced microbes r gud. 😁 True, we've seen mutations already so...

It's far flung fairy tale. evidence seen havoc it. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome person's body make collagen, proteins interact collagen properly, altered formula results weaker connective tissue, usually stretchy skin, ability overextend joints, skin bruises easily scoop double dip, leave mouth swirl around eating next bite plain chip.  US invested vaccines took gamble they’d work could that. way screw poorer countries funding risky R&amp;D early production companies incentive it. vaccines might exist otherwise. subgroup unvaccinated people fence, unmotivated get vaccine. incentives push people make happen. 

The antivaxxers, ones anti-vaccine completely, aren’t going compelled regardless. They’ll achieve immunity eventually via infection. IANAD mind pretty powerful—could related increased stress adrenaline pandemic related stressors, alleviated slightly less worry since getting vaccine.

I mention PVCs calmed lot getting vaccinated, feel like I’m also less worried Covid could psychological link. hard science obviously, thought. I'd love see that, hard imagine getting time soon. Really good know ! think conflating mis-characterization COVID aerosol vs airborne illness comment general we've known poor ventilation indoor environments disease transmission. Yup lived Japan 10 years. Moved home Oregon bam, allergies. really get point incentive programs getting vaccinated. Every single person I've spoken refuses get vaccine there's incentive, they're claim there's enough data safety, free beer something like going change them. government would reach people better campaign highlighting available data safety effectiveness vaccine simplest possible terms pounding people's brains again. Part like, well refuse vaccine get covid, that’s you. However part believes need make sure protect truly cannot vaccinated, ensure hospitals don’t become overwhelmed again. Hopefully enough people get vaccinated eventually doesn’t happen. I'm going keep wearing mine public places makes sense, especially California.

I'm sure public places I'm likely going wearing one start flying work - least plane likely airport well. that's get regular cold flu less COVID. Outside that, I'm far less concerned vaccinated. son somehow managed bring home two colds within two months starting school spring even masks, half days, social distancing. still lol November 2019. Feels good living town nearly 80% adults vaccinated.  serious virus knocks completely 7-10 days, plus recovery. can’t tell many people work claim “had flu” 1-2 days. wasn’t flu, cold.

While agree people likely mistake colds flu quite bit, wrong saying flu severe. 

The severity runs gamut asymptomatic death, everything between. Flu Asymptomatic**  average, roughly 20% unvaccinated serologic evidence influenza infection, three quarters infected asymptomatic. CDC conclusions?

The Netherlands mask mandate public accessible buildings (indoors) since December 1st. that, experts always doubted effect masks.

Now, sticking rules. Mandatory masks indoors publicly accessible buildings everyone. plans get rid Netherlands get rid pandemic measures, masks part basic measures. happen everyone chance get fully vaccinated, hope happen September 1sf, new school year starts. reason takes long, seems around 90% population wants vaccinated. thought 12 testing effectiveness rather safety ideal dosage produce desired immune response. thought going blood draws test antibodies could use data extrapolate effectiveness. see waiting infections like adult trials? answer question trials? always wonder, factor careful people daily lives tell go maskless avoid social distancing? seems like behavior different people would huge impact results. believe remember watching SciShow video back day talking CO2 levels city vs rural. Even schools CO2 levels high enough impact scores negatively.and think driving long periods time recirculating air.

Even since I've put effort cracking windows often areas twice natural immunity UK so...  china sus Come on, man... article [As May though, CDC monitoring severe breakthrough cases result hospitalization death. previously tracked reported breakthrough cases, including largely mild asymptomatic

So stopped tracking cases vaccinated people unless end hospital dead.

If they're tracking it, they're counting it. kind slight misstep certain someones accuse blood-sucking vampire... I'm surprised remains conservative forecasts!  Yup, dod exact scenario. One trash, one puke medicated blood pressure occasional rhythm issues.  long time went a-fib two separate occasions day. fairly common feel PVC's even rare little run rhythm flutter. see cardiologist really lot restrictions. completely unscientific ever since got Pfizer doses felt anything like whatsoever. I've felt amazing 5k runs lifting sessions. energy normally too. can't help wonder something go heart tissues post vaccine actually *benefitted* me. Like said completely half assed idea weird coincidence. weirdest possible maneuvering got actual flu last year. never get flu. also say get cold marvelous. That's true. I'd real research rather get optimism random reddit comment.  I've telling people eat flu season years.


If think anyone making minimum wage working going *allowed* sick, fucking delusional.

I screamed manager trying write *coughing loudly kitchen bothering customers* like bitch I'M SICK. See two trash cans? One specifically puke. 

I working line plating food abput go btw. quit next day (not really, called sick said come fired.) Fuck red mobster Another asthmatic checking ask wtf talking about? also basically testing flu, probably factor. Indian variant taking off. Troublesome. Plenty areas US lower vaccination rates UK. How's link flagged? UV safe humans period knowledgeable statement. US really needs get single payer health care. get free health care costs go down. Canada biggest complaint Hospital bills parking fees. staff, past infection around 60% less likely become infected again.

So opposite said. Americans ones kinda sad tbh. Small town canada. choices there's also probably 7 year waitlist unless know someone. best situation honestly. Imagine high trust government believing people conspire...

(Yes I'm vaccinated) president rep dem it?
That seems like saying pres went Harvard would somehow make better decisions went Yale?
Trump Blew Yes!!
Also really care hear president ""tweets""! SAME!! came two waves. thought getting mild cold whoop, sore throat, coughing, congestion, etc. thought COVID-19, antibody test done April 2020, didn’t detect antibody amount “positive” level. work congregate facility got 3 colds covid. Or, Californians, 0.8 representatives (four fifths house member) 0.03 senators, one thirty-third senator.  Enforcing wrong word. outside commercial buildings?

They're close fan, systems. house enormous electrostatic filter, pump, basement. I'm supposed take hose every year.

Every house I've lived physical mesh filter grate return duct. Oh nooooo. Damn little vectors. already decided I’m masking train next winter. coming similar conclusions respect indoor masking US CDC? oddly enough wife minor colds since feb 2020. would get maybe one two year since covid restrictions least 8 10 short two day colds. nothing major terms severity, annoying we've treated possible covid. PCR test nostril completely cleaned several days afterwards. Yuck. Seriously. think shutting country stopped covid masks did. *cries Louisiana* filters probably changed they're keeping system running improving air quality. building probably suffers sick building syndrome. understanding youre vaccinated get lot mild. So, still worth.

This original comment spawned thread. see anyone claiming ""100 percentage effective"". living fear like 31. treat communicable diseases. Pandemics different. Big reason I’m still wearing mask time outside: vastly reduced seasonal allergies.  Also, children increased risk Literally true. says ""scrutinizing"" ""counting"". exactly said. They're still counting, they're investigating, scrutinizing, researching, genome sequencing, however else want describe it, unless they're serious cases. imagine vaccination requirement flying over, locals stipulation. said imagine 25 over, least one vaccine. Hahahahaha sorry must watching Faux ""news"" still thoughts this: 

Some viruses contagious covid limited measures huge impact. Basic things like washing hands help tremendously.

There places took things seriously, like cities diseases spread rapidly people live top other. even everyday wore mask mitigating. countries took lockdown seriously local strains could died way.

Your average suburban American lives fairly socially distanced anyway. stay car, shop groceries week max, see people, etc.. apart bar hoppers megachurches biggest risk average family exposed probably kids going school big sporting music events stopped. everywhere. came back Disneyworld daughter caught hand, foot, mouth disease 😡 Yea one might fit places. Agreed people overly optimistic  heard person blood clot! Covid conspiracy wipe flu.

For lot people healthiest year record. That’s…not immune systems work. cold 3-4 weeks now, life sucks. Right, applying authorization September, even approval takes month (which may well longer children involved) never meant shots arms September. CDC still counting breakthrough cases (as long states report them

Literally first sentence article says Centers Disease Control Prevention confirmed longer scrutinizing “breakthrough” COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people unless patient admitted hospital dies.

How different said?

Anyways, local health officials rely CDC methods data collection. First dose shots mean. 36k includes second shots No, know things. big thing Medicine learned particles greater 50 microns stay air minutes hours inhaled far away distance time. learned follow gravitational parabola ground.

This size dichotomy, small=airborne, larger=falling, stemmed misreading early Tuberculosis research, became kind unjustified dogma century.

The CDC faulty plan combat coughed droplets transmit COVID: 6-foot distancing. feet, COVID droplets, larger size threshold, would fallen air, thought.

It mid, late last year Medicine took enough notes Physics learn wrong. Distance enough, indoors.. Neither would plastic shields. safe, we'd wear masks, breathe UV-sterilized air. Yeah, I’ve flu three times life. kid, teen, three years ago. time go doctor felt beyond sick. flu 7 days lying couch drifting sleep. can’t work, barely eat, thing go bathroom. 

This personal pet peeve. didn’t get positive flu test, probably didn’t flu. I’ve many coworkers two days “the flu” yet still answered emails. That’s impossible. things mostly opening back normal yet? Pfizer said aiming apply September suspect later Allergies top brutal year neck US. don’t fever, it’s probably allergies. Damn it, North Carolina. Stop holding us legal weed. Yep happened couple times now! get together friends first time year half WOW lot say. 5 hours talking cross-talking even bit yelling throat absolutely raw day following day. Thought getting sick, turns injured throat vocal cords! Living US sure feels like is. Maybe health insurance again, I'll look it. now, Flonase is. Yep. I've seen cooks need trashcan line throw in. might difficult sub 12 group really want take time make sure safety issues predominate given kids age less risk figure best dosage. No. Russian QC challenged Brazil case basically put nail coffin approving it. Long ago, first started commuting subway, got colds constantly. Once, back back. miserable. Pretty soon realized needed wash hands every time got train. Guess what: colds. people said died COVID didn’t. 

Yes, fake deaths.

How people actually believe this??? article pretty complete list rules changed English. That’s mostly shut country down. remember working clothing store girl puking back periodically shift manager wouldn’t let leave. Correct are. sure people got idea going September shots arms, one credible ever claimed anything like that. Nobody knew vaccines would work ones would face delivery issues. Seems like Pfizer consistently exceeding delivery targets internationally. Nice. Better late never. better. Madea says ""covid"". think obesity somehow dangerously contagious, may different story. lupus. experience , ask parent young child obviously sick... “don’t worry, it’s allergies.” I'll take new shoes jab got much sun, could sun poisoning. got myself, It. Sucks. US donating 25 million vaccines. going Covax. announced morning. Try again. Cocktails go? mitigated singing extra loud shower. neighbors aware left, left. shampoo bottle left. say Hey scabdiver guy got downvoted oblivion Soft Power competition done right.

China also donated shit load vaccines Cambodia. place live I'm happy that. waited US, would wait till 2023 something. Yet herpes still block. Since small, I've susceptible strep throat. every year, 50/50 chance getting every late spring, though Covid restrictions made much safer.. Anyway check symptoms, since usually need antibiotics get well. I’ve like 4 colds since pandemic started, including one right Yeah whole last year I’ve sick head. negligible risks shot. also negligible like ten times higher risk getting covid. free. Might well tumor! poor Nepalese? rich dude USA speaking behalf Nepalese? wonder USA seems stalling vaccination numbers. Israel - seems almost stopped. Whereas instance UK Chile power despite range rate vaccinated people. always wear mask dumped grass garbage allergies. spent rest lawn mowing itchy watery eyes uncontrollable sneezing. Probably done first place instead hit miss vaccines every year. Doesnt government approve vaccine distribute it? Honestly look data. Lots people got vaccinated they're still fine. suspicious first came think legit. Please get Well, 275 5 million course 6 months. 10-22 number looking whole year, double it.

That means Pfizer group rate 11 per 100,000 within normal range. fact, low range normal. 

So clue they're even talking this, Pfizer vaccine recipients rate myocarditis unvaccinated people. I'm new allergies, still assume sick season. can't tell difference yet. 45 allergies 3 years now. cold, hard tell. know downvoted, true. like we're eliminating things altogether (which would awesome). society realized safest children catch chicken pox young age wrong question slower spread, later exposure unintended harmful consequences. mitigated vaccines first world countries, may beneficial countries less vaccine access. Pfizer sold reduced price mid income countries cost developing countries. Like many others even catch seasonal cold. Funnily enough get covid though. doctor office/hospitals mandating it, government mean? I’m hopeful get something agreement. EU opened internally pretty much vaccinated people, U.K. seem cacooning ourself away VaRiaNTs “It found one dose Pfizer jab, recipients less likely develop antibody levels Indian variant”

What’s articles? keep seeing headlines claim Pfizer Moderna vaccines demonstrably less effective Indian variants. read research looks specifically efficacy *one* dose. get studies important countries looking delay second dose, articles focusing on. infections seem constantly getting transmissible virulent way covid getting. happening? limit catching deadly covid become stops changing much? I've read similar study concluded something along lines ""we're dumbing mankind atmospheric CO2"". could overall benefit from, work/live in, higher O2 concentration we've decades, maybe even centuries. slash life jackets neighbor put later on.

Blocking ingredients leaving US insanely stupid example. not. Turns lot people get badly lol, sorry.

Furthermore, according CDC, whopping ~19% experience symptoms all! ""The overall pooled prevalence asymptomatic carriers 19.1% (95% CI 5.2%–35.5%) type influenza.""

Varies year strains, simple fact lot people get either minor symptoms.  Oh God hate trust Americans, take Pfizer Johnson Johnson Moderna shots.

Then I'll take BioNTech Janssen vaccines ;) wonderful who's taking astrazeneca UK?


Everyone you. article England, UK related. someone got vaccine soon possible - I'm glad hear quit. ridiculous require medical procedure job.   course are. destruction nature fueled capitalism. Overconsumption basis capitalism. order customers consume stuff, nature destroyed get resources needed make said stuff. Add sheer number people consuming problem becomes obvious. capitalist government going say ""buy less stuff"", solution this. Yup! sure :D Shut already pretty common Germany. People 60 got first shot AZ choose take mRNA 2nd shot. Shocker, speed kills. thing keeping lid traffic deaths congestion build roadways speed first, shock eliminate constraint deaths skyrocket. trend continued even worsened extent 2021 well. Mask basic cleaning goes long way get every year common cold. flu something lot serious. lifetime, you’re expected catch flu 6-7 times.. Hope so! caught around set even wearing mask himself. vaccinated. Trust vaccines. Don’t anti-vaxxer.

Am vaccinated. Support vaccinations.

But also extremely novel virus. wearing mask major hardship, especially California State fire every year past 5 years. probably old then. Well, look terms deaths prevented, likely broad coverage 80% immunity better shallower coverage 95%. You’ve gone lot past decade I'm heavy immunosuppressants I'll wearing mask doctor's appointments essentially forever. got used cold 2 months every year, first time sick all. really wish people would start wearing masks feel sick - us immune response fight basic infections. Unless missed it, says one jab antibodies lower (than vaccines?). likely second shot? Unless ass, bed.. 5+ days, dying.. flu.

This definitely true though. vaccine far less, agreed, even without I've bad 3 days it. yes, tested. flu.

There lot different responses different people different viral loads variants. I'm sure coincidence vaccines actually stop people getting sick spreading it. /s avoid stigma places. theories say Fauci could partially funded lab years back

The people use 'gotcha' people idea research funding works. NIH NIAID fund research lots labs around world. leak dangerous pathogen *anywhere* there's good chance lab received least *some* funding NIH NIAID many labs work with. 

A quick search indicates around sixty Level 4 labs worldwide. would bet $100 least 75% received kind NIH NIAID money. They're top labs world. course would have. Less half Iowans vaccinated. hate here. Kansas? likely get it. covid pretty much burned point though? mean it'll easy enough cross, another thing right alongside normal passport Whats saying? made bed go lie it. 🤷🏻‍♂️ proletariat replaceable. Thanks reply. understanding are, I’m scientist. Pfizer pay attention info vaccine; sure others thought compare transmission. Hoping everyone’s sake vaccination rates increase quickly. Masks required everyone get jab. reap benefits risk others health? sick years got Covid-19, sick since. I'm glad I'm person gets flu every year cold every season. people always asking got flu shot 🤣. No, never will. flu since H1N1. What? Nearly everyone does.

The people choose get vaccine instead COVID better risk analysis. Yes true, point simply can't assume 30% unvaxxed would still protected natural immunity. Could like color red? One reason virus deadly became pandemic already darn good jumping person person.

The UK South African variants subtle tweaks spike protein understand. UK variant particular even efficient infecting people (read: contagious) mutation big enough make original vaccines work it.

It already near evolutionary peak hit us, really many ways could improve. Become deadly? turn ebola, spread *after* host dies kills fast. That's never global outbreak. Become *less* deadly? Hey, we'll take it, another seasonal cold.  No, says vaccinated workers still wear mask around even single unvaccinated person. effectively requires masks workplaces, except maybe really small offices. There's way customers retail stores restaurants vaccinated, takes one antivax asshole office force everyone wear mask. I’ve seen servers same. Talk table, puke back, go back table. tried call job would threatened.  trying patent it. since we're talking UK I'll share this, also Pfizer/Moderna. Long story short, even get covid, vaccinated, chances transmission high. see vaccinated people restricted all.  Switzerland today. It’s true, don’t necessarily know yet. people covid don’t appear antibodies testing for. People vaccinated also gone get covid well.  expect China fully transparent. /s puts par (or less) unvaccinated flu. Lots people die every year flu reason people like coming threads devils advocate position. It’s good feel comfortable 12 year old about. 

Getting room issue. LOL. vaccines product decades global, scientific research underlying technology. one country truly lay claim them.
The pharmaceutical industry globally powerful they're able monopolize scientific advancement profits ending pandemic. 

I'm exporting doses, 80 million effectively nothing terms vaccinating world especially US blocked IP waivers almost entirety pandemic, now, still slowly, working TRIPS waiver look like. Isn’t study showed current vaccines offer 5x less antibody protection previously thought? That’s abit worry imo. think optimistic say solution. Maybe deceleration. Earth polluted worsened long dramatically change process. Take CO2 net emissions instance. 51 billions tons CO2 emitted yearly; even decrease 10 billions 5 billions, long awesome would be, climate change would still go way, slower. *zero* CO2 emissions halt climate change, happen easily. 

I hate capitalism attitude consuming that's enough all. also need innovation, make everything green possible, lower costs developing countries (or China) never care I'd imagine smaller number individuals would transmit village village. people deliveries, say

If people vaccinated would probably go long way protecting villages, even get vaccinated Yes places concentrated first, places little medical care. area (city 30k) rate 65% least one dose. Nov 2019 boi New carpet? Ugh Might well helping people mental health issues, then. Certain effects can’t stripped away cause, and, can’t decipher cause effect looking effect has.  Yeah too. Poor excuse. Yukon, next door highest vaccination rate Canada. Thanks posts. enjoy reading words, bible belt fucked? Depends data tracker.

[CDC's data says count vaccination happened rather recipient shows number doses administered within state territory every 100,000 people total population. reflect residency person receiving vaccine, received it. Fake, specifying potato heads pronouns liberal conspiracy. Unvaccinated people licking other's eyeballs. Yeah covid cause clotting dysfunction. Probably vaccine showing properties. I’m disappointed many upvotes. realize people received vaccine legitimate health reasons, right? also limit healthcare overweight chronic health issues? absolutely insane ban fully vaccinated people leisure travel. vaccines work known variants. governments believe vaccines work? It’s frustrating it’s going get worse. essentially locks lower class travel all, since everyone able work home quarantine. also people covid multiple times.  Kids cases plummeting alongside adult cases. Kids need vaccinated enough adults are, read article. Israel anyone get vaccine, UK vast majority 30's still waiting invitation get first vaccine take older groups high supply constrained.

The people spreading virus right school aged children (schools open) 20/30 somethings (as everything basically open again). lot places low vaccination already higher waves covid. Natural antibodies places could even out.

Natural immunity stronger initially thought would be, thankfully. I'm glad got vaccine covid, worth.

That's CDC changed guidance. Even unvaccinated low live high vaccination area, despite risk.

I'm saying fault people wearing mask, vaccinated area vaccinated, guidance politics. I'm pro-mask, point becoming theater. claim kids simply factual. Every expert acknowledges influenza worse people 12 COVID.

And influenza constituted national public health emergency very, long time. That’s always case - compare SARS COVID-19.  Yep. It’s really profound understanding one learns get older. Shapes worldview.

One unrelated example learned stint hippy / natural community living Hawaii.

Hippies, despite philosophies preach, mirror behavior every society. 

There’s hierarchy, like capitalist society. People always trying work way it. top get girls. bottom dont. money, you’re higher.

Something acts pseudo religion (like mentioned). 

People still anything get rich, like normal society. There’s greed, jealousy, every human vice.

I learned lot, big takeaway innate human traits don’t change, aren’t going to. propulsion people toward religion isn’t going away.

Companies facilities US manufactured it. companies also facilities elsewhere world; countries facilities located didn’t block export like US did. Thankfully— whole rest world would still waiting struggling. dangerous variant likely emerge situation vaccination prevalent. virus running rampant amongst unvaccinated, little selective pressure adapt overcome vaccines defense ""we're marginally better russia china"" something wrong. required part job, facing public. safety standard employees customers. interesting (re: appendix)

Holy shit knowledge world it’s like we’re scratching surface UK entering 3rd wave thanks Indian Delta variant. I'm surprised hesitant. Typically though less lethal strain prevalent become. “good virus” one infectious ness high go it’s lethality near zero. faster kill less people spread you. live Brazil definitely relate saying, feel exactly thing LMAO.

-California worker weeks probably THANK YOU. Pfizer’s contribution capital — insignificant gesture, it’s technology. Hell, weren’t even first company license BioNTech’s vaccine.  can't imagine would be, no.

There's lot manual work go reporting daily. example, labs obviously aggregating data anyway, that's whether daily weekly. submitting data every day takes time submitting every week.

Maybe publishing automated process FL, state (IL), someone manually adding things daily press releases, weekly/as needed take less effort. Anything that's already automatically scrubbing able weekly rather daily either automatically (if built well) simple one-time update. course, long there's daily reporting cases, daily media cases, takes lot effort too. agree point, hospitalizations deaths lag cases. won’t see rise couple weeks behind rising cases. read something today that, COVID precautions, strains flu may died off. remember someone comparing Pfizer Moderna cars, saying like invented modern Tesla first car ever made. vicious cycle. Brain function loss (often brought conspiracy theorists Facebook) leads vaccine denial leads COVID leads brain function loss. I'm clinical trial run UCLA. asking case physician looking forward June 15 California masking mandate ends. Apparently, they're ending UC heath care workers.

The University California hospital system conducted study past year, found despite pandemic, total employee days lost illness way due masking. So, they're continuing practice going forward. Deaths young people could prevented house hold they’re not... parents getting vaccinated idea I’ve gotten shot. There's really need daily COVID numbers more. Part getting back normal hear COVID every day. COVID need 24/7 media attention StOp PoLiTiCiZiNg didn’t fuckin say conversation shouldn’t include deaths. said currently discussing, per article discussing case counts, fourth wave. fourth wave stemmed bunch people one doses.

Additionally, breakthrough infections appearing significantly mild normal unvaccinated cases. absolutely matter even deaths, breakthrough cases (which lot one doses 33% preventative) seem die 1-2% rate.

We don’t concrete data many lingering symptoms, know occur frequently seemingly light symptoms. Hence cutting transmission matters. 

As well partially vaccinated population ripped existing variants BREEDING ground new ones.

I can’t believe you’re seriously arguing importance second doses. Every single doctor screaming right second doses ramped light new data. Bury head sand want to, doesn’t change facts. Yeah. Japan, stroll without mask exhibiting symptoms, they'll mask. Granted, sick people walk mask lol don’t feel oppressed wear mask mate. Stop using pants line.

I remember throughout pandemic lot hospitals decreased things like elective surgeries could take covid patients (that never came thankfully). hospitals opening back probably want spaces covid patients

what people scientifically illiterate cannot make ***informed*** decision? Vaccinated people still spread virus. outbreaks began Singapore. Unvaccinated countries cautious. open enough populous vaccinated. immune deficiency issues, part unlucky 5% people get COVID despite vaccinated.

To clear, 5% vaccinated people get COVID, even among unvaxed 100% infection rate. 95% efficacy rate means similarly sized populations, infection rate vaccinated population 5% unvaxed infection rate is. far lower 5% vaccinated population. We've seen 5x even 7x fewer antibody titers quoted various studies different vaccines different variants since start vaccination campaign. end result always same, percent less effective enough make meaningful difference.

5x fewer antibodies means nothing vaccine typically produces way 5x what's necessary good immunity. Would heavily redacted Atlanta? Hell, China requires Atlanta's lab's employee's medical info would get laugh room.  China makes contribution renewable energy production renewable energy research.

Second, people die achieve natural immunity get wiped mutation.

Thirdly, people can't get vaccinated, everyone protects people can't. Prob forgot 🤷🏿‍♀️ can’t even request officials lol. hire hackers hack emails find really hard believe. lol Good. Thought I’d check Eric-Fiegl-Dink Deepti Gurdasani Twitter long time. really don’t want pandemic over… love pumping fear much without giving context, borderline anti-vax insistence protection Delta variant “low”.

That one time check. following them, please unfollow, it’s healthy. Things may get better worse, never near went last year. lot “experts” secretly hoping worst hope staying relevant, it’s sad. strict lockdown? Looks like case rates deaths plummeting. Fingers crossed Aha, interesting. matches read subreddit. planning mandate masks all, masks none. want create split society vaccination status, especially everyone chance get vaccinated. everyone wants finally vaccinated, masks probably even needed anymore anyone due high vaccination willingness here. 

They also working strictly invitation age based system young old. literally inviting one two years (e.g. 1983 today, 1982 yesterday). exceptions age groups people higher risks (priority groups) COVID-19 specifically, like people institutions (e.g. nursing homes prisons), people health risks COVID-19 healthcare workers. politicians (our Prime-Minister got vaccinated coupe days ago), teachers Police Officers example. pretty strict controlled, make appointments beforehand eligible vaccine (which checked). 

Because working young old, bit unfair younger generations. Also, without good way verify vaccination status (without violating privacy) means lot unvaccinated people try seem vaccinated, work honor system.

People vulnerable Covid-19 could require booster BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine later year, according scientists said shot elicited lower antibody response Delta variant first identified India.

A study researchers Francis Crick Institute UCLH Biomedical Research Centre found levels neutralising antibodies recipients two shots vaccine were, average, five times lower Delta variant original strain emerged Wuhan, China.

In research letter published medical journal Lancet, scientists said results showed older people affected antibody levels declined time. 

Emma Wall, infectious diseases consultant UCLH, said “the important thing” ensure vaccines keep many people possible hospital. 

“Our results suggest best way quickly deliver second doses provide boosters whose immunity may high enough new variants,” added. 

After one dose BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, 32 per cent people showed quantifiable antibody response Delta variant, study found. contrast 79 per cent people quantifiable antibody response original strain coronavirus first jab.

Only 25 per cent showed response Beta variant, first emerged South Africa. known exactly level antibodies required protect disease. 

Eleanor Riley, professor immunology infectious disease University Edinburgh, said data suggested vaccines may offer “somewhat less protection infection Delta variant”.

But Riley cautioned antibody response factor dictated effectiveness inoculation. “These data cannot tell us whether vaccine less effective preventing severe disease, hospitalisation death; need wait actual data outcomes,” said. 

“There reasons optimistic score, immune responses — cells — also contribute protection severe disease may less affected mutations affect antibody neutralisation.”

A study Public Health England last month real world impact vaccines, found two doses BioNTech/Pfizer shot slightly less effective Delta variant, showing 88 per cent efficacy, compared 93 per cent Alpha strain first identified Kent. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine also less effective, study found, efficacy falling 66 per cent Alpha variant 60 per cent Delta. 

Pfizer said seen Francis Crick UCLH study. 

Also Thursday, Public Health England warned early evidence suggested “there may increased risk hospitalisation” disease caused Delta variant compared Alpha variant, first identified UK. cautioned, however, data needed confidence finding. 

The public health agency said Delta overtaken Alpha variant dominant Sars-Cov-2 variant country. added 278 people attended A&amp;E week, resulting 94 overnight admissions. marks slight uptick compared last week, 201 attended emergency services 43 admitted, said.

The agency stressed “the majority [cases] vaccinated”. Among admitted hospital overnight, 66 per cent vaccinated all, 5 per cent received doses, according PHE documents. health body urged continued caution, saying “absolutely crucial” people played part preventing spread contagion. think perhaps 1000 years future humans may see records archeological survey area. Similar sometimes find Roman artifacts. us countries aren’t US really can’t go “get one,” though. Canada delaying second doses, it’s actually really important us know effective single dose act accordingly. Lots countries boat. also got little sick although minor sore throat lasted day. bizarre though sure. lockdowns, mask adherence, social distancing. 

without herd immunity populations (70% estimate), growth exponential. exponential growth means ever increasing numbers unless policies implemented reduce spread (as previously were). 

currently, many southern states removing masks social distancing guidelines with, frank, dogshit vaccination rates. risk outbreaks, article outlines. case they'll need implement measures reduce spread again. 

we saw summertime reduce rates last year. come fall, we'll see ~30% vaccination rates enough prevent exponential growth select states.

When again? we've never 30% entire population infected once. course I'm going extreme, say ""hospitals never overwhelmed 30% population risk"", imagine tomorrow 30% population suddenly infected. would hospitals look like then?

the true point exponential growth exponential growth. matter applied percentage population. benefit vaccinating reduces risk hospitalization chance infect others. experts saying 70% enough prevent exponential growth occurring. again, look south, even close that. definitely risk seeing exponential growth. exponential growth continues grow. measures taken happens, could grow infect large percentage population.
