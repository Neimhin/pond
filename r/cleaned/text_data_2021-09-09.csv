I'm flying INTL November hope things much better then. Especially around cattle cars FEMA soon buy.    hospitalisations almost ten times higher last year point. number hospitalisations relation number found infections half high, that's least partially five times many tests done. one tests, mild nonsymptomic cases one finds. Covid seasonal correlates strongly uv radiation air humidity. Numbers go winter.  say, parroting sides bullshit    Trump always got one covid press conference

He certainly Invent new Covid that‚Äôs infectious benign‚Ä¶..Will work?  Great. Norway follow suit. 

Can't wait zeta variant Covid.   Might harvesting effect (mortality displacement). Denmark overall negative excess mortality rate like Norway did, possible certain age groups, negative excess deaths past 18 months. Covid restrictions protect vulnerable infectious diseases risks. Same. Bring downvotes, country literally chiseled concept personal Liberty. either away Liberty foundation republic, willfully ignorant. say person got doses early possible get booster available.

There ALWAYS limitations personal liberty name greater good. examples:

* rights end mine begin (you free murder right life)
* times danger, country implement military draft (most would disagree reasons last employed, would agree draft needed makes sense)
* need demonstrate drive car safely, maintain insurance registration responsibility seriously harm kill others operate car properly.
* need wear shirt shoes inside public places inconsiderate others.
* children need updated vaccination records prior enrolling school ensure less likely bring spread something harmful others.

Basically, one ever 100% free. need make reasonable compromises order participate society. Wearing masks vaccinated reduce spread danger virus reasonable compromise. local (SW) news God awful. refuse hold account first thing, anytime mention Democrats say ""Eeww"" voice that's paper fair balanced, see. also say ""Eeww"" code say ""Mask mandate"" ""Forced vaccination"".

The government well aware general public cannot trusted right thing public health crisis.  anyone know Medicaid vaccine mandate applies literally every single provider accepts Medicaid? certain ones? release White House website mentions hospitals, dialysis centers, home care may limited that.

I ask actually fairly worried Medicaid recipient healthcare care providers going drop Medicaid coverage instead enforcing mandate, it‚Äôs already impossible find doctors certain things Medicaid.

My dentist called today cancelled next appointment told don‚Äôt take Medicaid anymore. I‚Äôm worried thing might happen mental health center go to, example. Haha hell? moved Missouri Alabama 1990. vaccine schedule different Alabama, forced (just like children) get unnesecary extra MMR vaccine required everyone... 

I bit annoyed thing blue book filled shot kids getting. even compared book showed everyone already shot previous year. gave shot anyhow anyone get shot allowed come back school. even go get certificate county health department enrolling year, verifying looked immunization record (the blue book) date everything. 

Nobody thought sort violation rights, although redundant shot seemed pointless, process seemed pretty reasonable ensure kids wern't spreading diseases other.

I think overestimate unvaccinated.  keep making point here. talk social responsibility, personal risk/reward. something like 90% adults vaccinated.   Based what? Nope. People get employed.

Assuming absolute worst case delta Ro 10 (assumed around 8ish) would require 90% either immune via infection vaccination. 

Recent serological surveys found antibodies around 80% Americans blood. 

I agree Covid likely endemic due failings vaccine instead folks like you.  Sure, I'll put kettle on. Americans people world unvaccinated? America latest they've banned?  Thanks. Aight makes sense evolutionary perspective. vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, virus able replicate immune system squash down. every replication virus throws mutations, inconsequential detrimental virus survival. mutation allows virus bypass previous immunity positively selected provides adaptive advantage able replicate further, hypothetically making vaccines ineffective. 

This hypothetical variant need ""worse"" terms lethality transmission, good get around immunity. Evolution work. 

The article goes explain unlikely happen mostly related vaccines produce polyclonal immunity, targeting several parts spike virus. makes harder virus throw necessary mutations once. fact author forgot mention monoclonal therapies far higher risk inducing new variants vaccines. 

Having said this. impression much focus mutations spike (for good reason target vaccines) others cause immune suppression enhance replication.

Case fatality rate like 1‚Äì1.75%. Estimates vary widely numerous factors large, demographically geopolitically diverse country, 98.75% survival rate seems like reasonable compromise. 

It seems like calculations looking population-wide survivability, problematic you‚Äôre adding people never Covid equation. best practice, people would admit, minimize number infections people never infected (and vaccinated people breakthrough infections) *much* higher chance surviving Covid unvaccinated infected. 

Not much comfort nearly 700,000 Americans who‚Äôve already perished, many would *definitely* survived followed mask social distancing guidelines mandates early pandemic followed vaccine recommendations mandates later pandemic, highly effective vaccines became widely freely available.

Trucking turnover 150%, steady career, go lot truckers plan quit (already seen lot retire due new electronic logs mandated). that‚Äôs idea don‚Äôt mind alone lot   know understand previous poster politely patiently explained you.

I honestly see Reddit even respects SC. childish care institution said states could euthanize people intellectual disabilities. friend would dead due decision early 1900s. sure, childish, kid.

He‚Äôs one term guy choices making even clear. naughty idea.

Or say he's becoming vegetarian proof picture eating salad. 

Maybe he'll start realising easily facts manipulated support fake claims. i'm sorry america heavy heart must step position president. greatest honour life think know can't shred way america need going forward. really vaccine mandate opt weekly testing? mRNA vaccines studied decade already used case trials even COVID. That's easy deploy technology COVID vaccine.

They alter DNA. can't even enter nucleus cell DNA housed. mRNA proteins degraded removed body days. concerns long term effects somewhat silly. They're also proven effective triggering intended immune response showing safe vaccine. haven‚Äôt kept that, would mind giving executive summary?    Yes, that's talking  country chilled pain enslavement Garbage idea downvoted, I'm glad whoever evidently privilege getting hands test.

It's definitely location specific, COVID scare trying get hands at-home tests family. Every single place locally sold out, tried order online least 1-2 weeks delivery.

The appointments open ones take 5-7 days get results back. nothing available rapid testing unless clearly symptomatic.  Place going originally rule everyone vaccinated attend. people relaxed vaccinated need masked. People attending country.

I know masking works, can't shake feeling dropping vaccination requirement bad idea. asking much? Yeah, gerrymandered districts close enough thousand excess deaths among conservatives could make difference. exciting. flu vaccine portion also experimental, using mRNA. Kinda cool--my body cutting edge new technologies.  think need wonder people stopped trusting intellectuals. We‚Äôve epidemic before. remember getting vaccinated h1n1 flu. mom pushed get vaccine. Yet, 10 years later simply doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútrust‚Äù covid vaccine. don‚Äôt think mom dumb. I‚Äôm amazed 180 turn. read article one day conspiracy theorists usually use conspiracies coping mechanism avoid problems. something ponder, rather jump black white situation, even results indeed maddening. lady didn‚Äôt need die.

The average bus driver going watching road verifying one removed mask. We're tend selfish eastern societies collectivist.

I feel like that's one ""tends"" like ""men tend X women"" bell curves actually overlap lot.  Yes least won‚Äôt vote lockstep GOP it‚Äôs marginal win. think local vaccine similar Novavax. tempt good time.   parents took first vaccination badly. afraid take second one. cannot strike down

*laughs 6-3 supreme court*  that's brainwashed evangelicals Best luck you. there. message need talk anything, even though internet stranger. Hahahaha. promise childishness room coming me. Guarantee guy Facebook page spreading conspiracy theories vaccine far Trump lost election. lazy excuse  Get vaccinated periodic testing, mean? People conveniently leaving part testing also option. OSHA definitely ability require medical evaluation employees cases transmissible diseases toxic chemicals, offer voluntary alternatives (e.g. vaccination) satisfy legal requirement. Wondering too. Especially warehouse workers. work one, USPS. run shifts day long, 600+ people per shift. I'm happy this.
Package handlers trailer sweating talking breathing heavily. good mix.  people forget measures other's safety (even seatbelts). anti-vaxxers think themselves. understand everyone can't tested weekly....
Not everyone vaxed stops spread.....
If lack care, post.
It's cluster fuck testing atleast seems impact assuming folks vaxed dont worry it. Isreal others show elsewise.  mind sending too?

Are still that?Do website buying (if do)? One friend similar surrounding circumstances - minus illness mentioned - count 1800. girlfriend came 2500. can't answer question - good number would be.  nurses large hospital systems said vaccinated Oct 1st near thought going go another place got rude awakening.  school unvaccinated students Austin, Texas neighborhood relatively high income residents.  Whatcha mean? US military mandated already. Give quick Google. I‚Äôm AD USAF must fully vaccinated 2 November. means must two weeks past second shot then. even anti-vax. There's tons moderates think vaccines good, think federal mandates like vaccines pretty authoritarian. Look everyone getting vaccine good precedent bad.

Wtf?!  Anybody remember lotteries? Free beer? Free money?  It‚Äôs friends work said. going start applying. goes going dead covid  good reason think govt creating mandate mean around forever get worse it. 
 
On flip side, there's saying there's nothing permanent temporary government plan. Patriot Act supposed temporary response 9/11 etc. 
 
That said, point caution government mandates always good thing, good thing regards covid. likely hear people next weeks quote above, stupid point hear, covid terrible disease I'm full support ending thing best can, ""vaccine passports"" included. 
 
It's simple choice, get jabbed face consequences. Consequences mean miss society moving forward, person occupation activities included.      hope so. eyeing good government job.   *everyone*. justification/higher risk determination companies employ 100+ people, likely people close proximity.

I curious include sort exemption remote workers. someone works home permanently never interacts coworkers face face, still apply  ""I'll make gofundme page""

I wonder know everyone working able donate work us dont go office? No. original test (early 2020) one painful. using proper testing supplies.

I've done multiple since current, proper testing supplies use (mid-2020 onward), many people jobs. 

These painful. essentially tickle. point, fucking care want taken care moment sooner. I'm tired bending backwards people. Get vaccinated get tested weekly. choice. could say women Texas right now.  Again, keep trying trying avoid shared primary sources contradict exactly arguing trying backtrack look like fool are. 

You admitted didnt read primary source used back said shows actually read sources base opinion on. 

""Tell can't defend positions telling can't defend positions"" - trying say anything going me.. Attack person can't attack said.. Beautiful.. Continue make look like fool.

i would respected left alone admitted wrong, yet, like many people world, can't admit keep digging deeper.  JOB = JAB US 670,000 covid deaths far, conservative estimate four hospitalization per one death, thats already 2.7 million hospitalizations.

So 0.8% population.

But ratio probably higher, can't seem find it.   religious exceptions it‚Äôs kinda flawed though Unfortunately unvaccinated inundate medical system, yes, people‚Äôs health becomes part problem. That's pretty stupid take. things chance incorrect, assume incorrect? Guess else peer reviewed - foods safe eat, going starve trust people tell safe?    cannot enter Canada without proof full vaccination. Jabbed crabbed, baby! Yeah there‚Äôs term that‚Äôs spelled unemployment laws. make life hellish enough reasonable person would quit (which open ended enough never sure counts). sad easily cheaply ones soul may bought..... defunded education surprised masses can't think critically. Big shocker. every restaurant franchise.  Unvaccinated coworker getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs working addition sanction FAA may impose unruly passengers. get tested Friday.. exposed long Full approval Pfizer adults (age 16 up), 12-15 year olds still receiving vaccine EUA.   Agreed, sure there's precedent level federal power.  Thank god. Maybe make progress. really should, going protect baby short-term, pass amazing antibodies newborn newborn likely best protection us since learned virus early life! yet determined within OSHA's rights. makes think carte blanch please? laws. deaths mean nothing legalize murder. 

Hey can't lose job plaguerat, murderer. 

What murderer freedoms! 

Lololol

You give one fuck one persons health death. 

You're bad fucking government. Norway lot deaths can‚Äôt explain, probably covid. Im super proud strategy could wouldn‚Äôt change thing. nice locked inside like animal cage. I‚Äôve wondering videos attract overwhelmingly antivaxx people.   never worked farm livestock then. Watch Hoof GP Youtube see prod cows get go chute. work healthcare. scheduled us vaccine day off, work next day despite feeling like absolute shit. 

Wish coulda time üò≠ Good. Honestly, fuck people refuse vaccinate, putting children family's lives risk. I'm tired stupidity killing people. beautifully elegant solution, evidence Biden smart people around him. Yeah, somehow mouth breathers found reason denigrate someone wanting stay healthy. drive antivaxxers polls like nothing else

Yeah, I'm curious see goes. next election year away people pretty short memory things return normal. 

Then again, already teed terrible winter vaccination rate go up. does, ""good"" winter 50,000 people die instead 300,000, fully expect GOP act like somehow nobody would died Biden done mandate. I'm looking buy house near future can't wait take one antivaxxer gone foreclosure. 

I can't fucking wait paint live laugh love stencil.  No, you. would like see relative, federal contract employee recent widow, get vaccine rather die risk disability. Ditto mother, 90s, whose health care controls. relative's ""conviction"" Covid Democrat plot driving wedge family. makes even less sense businesses ten employees already implement OSHA guidelines.

The OSHA regulations employers 10 employees exempt recordkeeping requirements. amazing mental gymnastics people go defend either two idiots. fucked America two best choices president? Idiocracy here.   interesting theory


i concur No! sources information (FoxNews &amp; OAN) agree. Idk mandate lifestyle change big, also hate insurance tied employment. Incentives obese include making healthy foods affordable accessible working eliminating food deserts (this achieved growing food people live instead continuing use traditional farming methods trucking produce everywhere,) bringing wages belong working class people need work 3 jobs make ends meet thereby affording TIME takes get exercise prepare healthy meals, encouraging wearables within socialistic medicine system. Different way attacking particular problem. mandate made necessary highly contagious pandemic- disease kills without regard lifestyle choices, I'll add. sure comment genuine trying snarkily show mandates might follow creates ""slippery slope""- apples oranges solutions obesity epidemic time consuming lifestyle changes applied noncontagious killer. ‚ÄúThat worse flu, *the* flu, know less flu-ey flu still fluable flu.‚Äù  Yep. predicte boost approval rating. It‚Äôs clear, decisive, right thing do. They've mandated sorts safety measures. vaccine disease safety requirement helmet. Jacobson establishes pretty clearly vaccine mandate unconstitutional itself. share industry? crazy feel well. family thought nuts told first shot scheduled even appalled found child getting vaccinated too. far know, none Idaho relatives vaccinated, so, they‚Äôre talking it. insistent getting J&amp;J last spring simply one shot used blood clot scare reason avoid getting vaccinated together. 

It‚Äôs sad think population boom recent years larger percentage SE Idaho isn‚Äôt vaccinated using precautions, especially relocated area ‚Äúscientologist liberals‚Äù (their words, mine) seem fear. Apparently many still think faith science medicine evil part scientology doctrine‚Ä¶ yes, suppose we‚Äôre lunatics. hope majority snap denial it‚Äôs late. feel like that‚Äôs something happened near start country shouldn‚Äôt surprising fighting branches power don‚Äôt know abortion ruling gets excused Marbury vs Madison boyfriend's 89 year old mother admitted hospital (orange county) suspected covid. whole family vaccinated mask compliant. lives daughter, got somewhere despite precautions taken.

I'm certain it, too. Going rapid test morning. Fuck virus.  Might want tone praise...you know, situation Afghanistan. Serious question, mechanism imminent death? Like going infect kill cells? mRNA deteriorates immediately, left antibodies.    They're not. They're mandating kids eligible. approved younger kids they're eligible, they'll need get it. COVID covering tracks! Yes would want combine flu shot 1st 2 shots covid series. lower dose booster though fine. would count taking day rest either way. Vaccine mandates soldiers different mandating vaccine general population. Dr Olsterholm said tv day northeast unlikely high spike high vaccination rates  holy shit balls good removing intestines humans, however! :D   Good. One less weak link touching vulnerable people. Maybe could go work service industry, keep seeing many people white hot mad labor shortages making burger take long.  It‚Äôs gonna okay: got dang madernas juice tell America also bombing civilians middle east, systematically oppressing black people, conducting unethical medical experimentation century. make right. Because: ticket + fine = profit !! I'm amaerican curious - concept liberty also stand else means endangering people? rather, reducing risk endangering people?

In case seems many liberties modern society would want follow.  Lotta vaxxed people happy employed‚Ä¶   highest bed count area covid 45. total beds available hospital 550+. realize that, stranger things happened past years. really hopeful option foresee without massive loss human life next two decades (in comparison much we'll lose continue nothing next year, year that). expect see common offering couple years covid lot toothless. great! Give liberty give death? choosing death why? Get fake vax cards Yup.. FYI, numbers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Except, covid still transmits, people vaccinated still hospitals. reduce risk yes. look tells many covid patients. tell giant hospitals 20-40 icu beds? I'll tell bullshit. Since OSHA regulation, think is, least big everyone seems claim. tend think government pretty broad discretion health safety. see courts agree. It‚Äôs also hard say whether white concept whiteness didn‚Äôt quite exist still fairly arbitrary. certainly didn‚Äôt look like modern day Palestinian Levant hadn‚Äôt invaded Arabs yet. said definitely didn‚Äôt look anything like Mormon Jesus.  Saying lord protect reminds old joke:

There man lived two story house. house near river unfortunately river began flood. 

As river rose, warnings given via radio, TV shortwave. Large jeeps drove area evacuate people. jeep drove man's house, told:

""You danger. life stake. must evacuate. Get Jeep. Let us help evacuate.""

""No,"" man replied doorstep. ""I faith. ok. flood get me. God take care me.""

The water continued rise.

Soon man second floor. boat going area arrived man's house. Rescuers made every effort convince man take action life would saved.

""You danger. life stake. drown flood.""

""No worries,"" says man. ""I faith. Everything ok. Even though flood rising, fine. God take care me.""

The flood continued rise.

The man went roof avoid rising water. helicopter pilot sees top roof hovers man. Using megaphone, pilot tries convince man grab rope ladder dangling head.

""You danger. flood still rising. drown grab rope ladder. Let us help you.""

""No worries."" says man. ""I fine. Yes, flood higher faith. God take care me.""

The flood rises. man drowns.

At pearly gates, man says God: ""I faith. let die.""

To God replies: ""I sent jeep, boat helicopter. could done you?"" vaccine like Kevlar vest on- protected, likely live, bullet still hit give nasty bruise. vaccine like taking bullet without vest. lucky feeling without vest? death roulette without it. hard friends person?  Except people working ""essential worker"" ruse without vaccine. FYI, numbers. 

New york stare 7 day average 33 deaths now. high around 1k April 2020. 

Florida right 7 day average 338. Yeah.. 338. 

Compared 38 new york state. tribalist. There's nuance view things. love people, abhor systems cause turn other. people want hurt humans, goal.

I never stated got vaccine not. believe vaccine likely safe generally effective. Also, f team. collective disease people pretend exists.

I agree, (and centrists matter) form echo chambers often hypocrite.

No, 500 years humans totally different values. might even care history let alone specific pandemic. entirely possible society become full anti-vaxxers. History progress, chaos destination. 

I care kid, leave alone go back towards basement. 6-3 conservative court make unconstitutional. 2016 important election lives deal crazies stacking supreme court 30 years.  yoink Let‚Äôs also talk mental health child caught Covid passed parent/grandparent later died.  Delta infectious 

Lockdowns always work.

But NSW least slowing reproductive rate vaccines work 2/1095ths year!  mostly waiting fda approval.   Sounds like late stage capitalism problem me. 

Having send kids death daycare parents work paycheck paycheck homeless.    I'm autistic, sarcasm forte üôÉüòÖ clearly don‚Äôt understand labor rights all. Clearly. 

Even Biden‚Äôs administration admitted might stand know bs media talking point. 

No government tell companies force employees don‚Äôt do. Biden knows can‚Äôt force people get vaccine hence he‚Äôs trying tell companies tht. companies don‚Äôt many already stated won‚Äôt comply. 

Companies don‚Äôt force anyone get flu shot. government never dared try even force people get shot. Schools require vaccines that‚Äôs around decades even don‚Äôt comply go private school doesn‚Äôt require it. 

And like changed HIV example gave towards way makes feel like don‚Äôt understand do. need tell you‚Äôre right everyone else wrong. It‚Äôs coping mechanism get it. 

No one deny fire someone HIV, health issue. can‚Äôt CoVid. Courts many places already stated much. Soon it‚Äôll get Supreme Court hear you‚Äôll see ridiculous demands go away. concern getting rid boomers, anything possible spread virus that's tailor-made take almost exclusively. eat much begin with, live winter. rarely outdoor dining nice able go dates partner üò∂   That's acceptable country regardless platform incredibly dangerous. president force private employers require medical procedures, even Trump gets elected. get tested prove aren‚Äôt actively endangering others near them. There's mismatch job availability job candidate qualifications. CAD work unemployed, likely going go job taco bell, even they're hiring. one fake vaccine cards Always do! right Trump failed released shit country. prison. Given virtually health care workers required vaccinated, meaning quitters able find anyone hire healthcare, retiring profession entirely. interestingiftrue.gif   Time lot job openings employees need workers. Everyone half brain, prepare move higher position, barrier entry lowered significantly. Don‚Äôt boof bro!  One kept cold hard transport relative other. Seems like could get two separate shots big deal. I'm seeing utility here. guess sorta convenient saves space? know someone couple years go gets public school system pension thinking early retirement avoid getting vaccine.  Sadly district not. vocal contingent anti-mask nut jobs. They‚Äôve started menace people show school board meetings made police presence necessary. people company asked company wide meeting bonuses would still paid people got fired getting shot üòÇ fact that's time textbooks must get vaxxed. There's room discussion deaths 600k. Fun fact, people often ‚Äúlose shit‚Äù die. Literally‚Ä¶ corpses release waste. sure hell blame him. option would couple dozen times end nearly drunk crowd learning sculpting something never emerge public again.  can't expose everyone pandemic educate handful. 

That's horrible trade. Yeah isnt government entities, private companies. BIG difference. Good riddance. People care people charge taking care them.   Made sketch said going go home masturbate anti-masturbation woman bit weird retrospect.

""I'm gonna it, there's nothin' it."" companies cannot mandate vaccines employees transfer another company. please daddy Biden force people think like threats force! cant handle others blindly follow government masters say! Finally get voted for. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è get offer, begrudge others, either. point, anything encourage vaccination fine, short giving three weeks' paid vacation something.  That's another aspect system baffles me.

What idiot thought necessary check legislative/executive branch requires people well-versed law uphold law, even law unpopular (or strike law unconstitutional, even popular) elected?

In universe make sense popularity contest position that's guaranteed unpopular, even require people educated trained subject matter?

How many states even require judges lawyers once? dad America. u/AutomatedZombie, seem agree getting vaccinated path decreasing deaths. science supports too.

Maybe mandate everyone point blank? Honestly I‚Äôm favor feels like might be. case, job requirements suddenly changed. problem. know post links products say: google armbrustusa. mask production co. TX places. make FDA approved surgical masks rated stated. love them. father notice much even noticed difference quality compared chintzy surgical masks buy big box stores.  I‚Äôm hoping knee jerk reaction company first day misunderstanding then, absolutely qualifies exemption. Haha good LOL, wonder feels stupid right now, hearing going requirement jobs. May lost backup plan.. unrealistic frankly magical thinking believe COVID ever way ""eradicated""  No. around 2 million federal employees. mandate private employers 100 employees expected cover 80M Americans. Another 17M workers health facilities receive federal Medicare Medicaid required vaccinated. Also contractors business federal government covered mandate. Hears kicker though. used live Oregon till month ago. Watch shirts. always picks something subject talking about. Also hat. sticker upside down, talking ""upside-down"" effort get people right nod along, flip everything upside down. He's actually gotten RW change position. good.

That makes different lot commentators YouTube. tries make think instead telling think. best videos like that. Trust I‚Äôm manager every person fired career NJ collected unemployment penalty phase. That‚Äôs written reason. dying mean. Lol yeah follow anti vaxxer Instagram. aren‚Äôt terribly coherent catch definite undercurrent seems think ‚Äúpeople starting realize vaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äù like people going rise revolt vaccines. vax furloughed, like United doing. fully vaccinated, grossly over-due.   impact happening. meant forcing remote workers go back. Good catch bare minimum balls. Real balls would mandate vaccinated enter federally regulated facility, airports. Assholes like gave elderly grandmother severe dementia Covid around Christmas. never got deathly ill, thankfully, let tell something.

Her entire facility quarantined rooms 5 months covid made way residents. allowed eat together visit other. staff member would bring meals 3 times day, dressed full biohazard gear, terrifying someone can‚Äôt remember there‚Äôs pandemic going on. outside visitors allowed indoors, stand outside window call phone, dementia means trouble using phone. (She would forget one would yell glass, awesome 90 year old lungs covid, would hear ringing ‚Äúanswer‚Äù TV remote instead.) 

She basically human contact Thanksgiving March so. 

So, yes. Fuck acquaintance, fuck whoever brought Covid grandma‚Äôs facility.  stooges said people weren‚Äôt working unemployment benefits. level brainwashing so, high. antivax nurses already getting tested weekly. least that's sister law job. Nothing really changing there. approaching total collapse healthcare system tool solve it, ethically. think Biden right thing. Thank god won. think termination still qualifies unemployment, least states i‚Äôve worked. it‚Äôs broke serious company policy something criminal (basically terminated something really shitty, vs. terminated able perform well expected too) eligible. That's president!!!!!!!!! Get vaccinated would think so?

How many people's employment contract said vaccinated prior taking job? organization already subject required vaccination due state requirements health care organizations. announced point, earlier week, became clear really, actually going enforced. ""May eligible collect""

Not cover quitting fired cause misconduct gross misconduct  agree, feel like us got hopes prematurely saw vax numbers going cases going spring. However, throughout 2020, told vaccine silver bullet; challenges remain, like vaccine hesitancy distribution that. feel like given vaccine rollout went better expected originally, vaccines‚Äô efficacy far higher anticipated, guess lot us kinda overlooked challenges remained started seeing vaccine light switch back normal. doesn‚Äôt sound like country sufficient infrastructure support, isolated island nations half population New Jersey. ‚ÄúForcing‚Äù remote work? doesn‚Äôt prefer remote work?

If nothing else saves money time you‚Äôd otherwise spend commuting. It‚Äôs selfishness take vaccine isn‚Äôt even year old. 

If vaccines good force people take it?! you‚Äôre vaccinated wtf care another isnt?!

And isn‚Äôt legal courts many parts country taken mandates. youre opposed company mandates vaccine choose vaxed lose job. government mandate directly interferes freedom choice. Using threat force (do say else) coercion.  vaccination sites (Southern California) provides vaccine without checking ID? Would like keep privacy possible. Thanks! friend hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated bc thinks vaccine hasn‚Äôt enough trials , suspicious booster shot. doesn‚Äôt think scientists know they‚Äôre doing. He‚Äôll get terminated accountant 9/27.   Oh wow, thank you. guess North Korea wonderland then!  mean generally wrong eyes companies government drug test, ban use steroids business. guy nut. Jesus f-ing Christ. That's tonight.... mean gum chewing moron. That's many people, though. Antivax rhetoric face unrelenting even rational people seed doubt planted them. ""research"" typically involves Facebook echo chamber groups misleading names web searches pointing blogs mimic news outlets. 

There's antivax, there's ladies like this. could well ended antivax camp caught COVID wholly fault own. failure rests social media groups complicit spread misinformation charlatans making bucks fear online. Maybe bounty companies comply, website report them.  police general support policies, unlikely much help.   thank you. might catch something.  pray coworker tell professional smartass   Shame live world ppl LIVE order responsive. amazing we're reactive society proactive one.

For clarity, recovery entailed band-aid nap. even need read know incorrect, first paragraph false. mRNA vaccine patients showed spike proteins traveled organs months taken. no, *always* eliminated quickly Oh shit *puts seatbelt back on*   still poking brain exposed cavity nostril? tested since got vaccinated, get tested couple times pretty uncomfortable.  least understand people say want get years. 
I agree least understand it. Pfizer BioNtech vaccine, right? one full authorization afterall   depends ask them.

if prior rollout, enough; ask hundred million shots given, require billions; billions shots given, 6 months road; 6 months passed 10 years; etc... Yeah. vaccine totally different vaccines I've since grade school cuz foxy news sed so.   really think going make difference, paying attention. 200 million currently vaccinated yet infection rates 3x higher last year, zero vaccinations. 

This going end government decides ends. ""No one holding injecting something veins. still choose remain vaccinated, deal consequences choice.""

Government mandates indeed forceful failure comply results forceful action government. literally government telling obey face repercussions. Comply lose job. 

Make mistake force. repercussions socially politically country. Jesus, talk throwing match tinder, like US population actively seeking destroy itself. Every day sides nudging closer civil war. Incredible. tick ... tock....tick...tock... mention TB test. work RN agree get TB test, technically injection get blood drawn. also get vaccines vaccination records, titer testing, yearly flu vaccine. I'm sure loophole get it, people act like new concept. can't imagine job prospects started arguing hiring process. We've similar things long time now. ‚ÄúVery extra‚Äù made laughüò¥ Right? didn‚Äôt know long term shocks chicken pox. didn‚Äôt know long term shocks measles. didn‚Äôt know long term shocks scarlet fever, rheumatic fever. 

‚Ä¶it‚Äôs difficult, annoying, terrible wear mask‚Ä¶  Maybe add emergency medical assistance hot areas instead forcing entire population inoculated half baked vaccine...? aussie that's watched subs get brigaded shocked americans suggesting live police state. I'm loving vaccine mandates coming US.

go team! Biden takes hit team.  OSHA make employees pay anything else related safety like this? business.

my point no, employees pay safety businesses do. however case employees free access safety (vaccine) government instead employer. deny vaccine, personally pay safety (required tests weekly) said companies (/government's) provided safety.

the problem is, said otherwise, Americans' inability simplest things respect fellow citizens. cannot get vaccine. cannot wear masks. cannot stay home get sick.

I've traveling around Europe past week. Switzerland, everyone wears masks indoors. Italy. cooperation obedience shocking. People respect folks working stores ensure mask entering. wear crowded outdoor spaces. complaints pretty much 99.99 percent adherance guidelines.

That's tough ask.  unvaccinated mouth breathers leave small town anyway. Ugh, depressing. Doubly since likely avoided simple shot.

How many ""so respirator regrets taking vaccine"" stories people wise up? every person refusing vaccinate responsible entire pandemic continuing. maybe aren‚Äôt responsible people‚Ä¶ yeah I‚Äôm gonna blame unvaccinated people loved ones get sick die. part, get shot, don‚Äôt wait you‚Äôre personally affected care people. Yea, definitely take precautions listed bottom. sure testing rules put quarantine yet. think different guidelines depending person vaccinated, exposed school, etc. I'm arguing. say like suddenly becomes problem tons people getting tested, back things up. good thing, problem, thats point. vaccine suspected cause myocarditis small number children young adults. Getting infected also causes serious complications small number young children. outcomes rare enough order determine effectiveness danger vaccine compare properly, need either large child test groups leave test run long time. 

For higher ages, comparison much easier, since bad COVID outcomes increases rapidly age. even 12-17 group, clear cut case. instance, UK science panel recommend universal COVID vaxing 12-17 group (the recommend higher risk factors). I've given hope people using percentages. Increasing ""to 200%"" ""by 200%"" mean two different things, nobody stops think they're actually trying say. happy fits ideology

Also fair assume least vaccinated seriously ill also passed window vaccine efficacy (3 - 4 months). 

I think end day, takeaway saying ""vaccines prevent critical illness"" caveat-ed with: everyone (age) overall, months. still moderates consider, rae losing shit right asked antivax co-worker (who preaching ivermectin covid cureall past two months) antiparasitic drug works covid, told ""it drug acts vector get zinc system"".

Since I'm stuck office (in COVID cesspool Florida) prevailing attitude amongst management old guard ""just flu, bro"" feel like everyday another 'internally screaming' day. utter insanity.  10x 1000% original. (10x)

1000% 900% **increase** 100%. (x + 9*x)

But **tenfold** means 10x, **increase** 10x original, 1000% correct headline. England hasnt, scotland wales skweing figures durability natural infection known, that's important people got COVID get vaccinated enhance durability protection. part referencing balls. unpopular move, president balls it, including Trump campaigned bringing troops home.

It‚Äôs easy say you‚Äôre healthy. actually get it, shit pants run ER. nationwide. Delta appears much less transmissible vaccinated people. read current data indeed referring hospitals comment.  People overestimating numbers conservatives dying.

Agreed. Obviously ""all conservatives"" dying. And, yes, that's also hyperbole, realize that, even then, that's nearly enough reasonably predict swing race.

Disagreed. Voting margins pretty narrow places.

Especially already dealing demographic shifts Texas. Shssh! USD $$$ centralized. used though!  Yeah, main page one shows appointments still. Good know mine broken guess. That‚Äôs new talking point I‚Äôve seen lately. Something Dems hypocrites said wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine Trump office. Somehow that‚Äôs excuse take now.  Part problem many people (not nurses) learn potential side effects think equal odds side effects them. ""There's 2 outcomes must 50/50 odds, right?"" Obviously that's wrong, undereducated people *sounds* intuitively right.

They seem understand scary side effects happen maybe 0.001% people everybody else there's issue. understand better odds winning lot money scratch lottery tickets blood clots vaccines.   literally calculated move - knowing ""blue"" counties **have had** far people die.

That's stopped case ever since widespread vaccine rollouts. Really stopped June last year blue areas continued taking precautions red areas said pandemic over. kids don‚Äôt smoke eat healthy. There‚Äôs nothing right protect COVID.

The ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know long term effects vaccine‚Äù argument makes sense vacuum, don‚Äôt know long term effects COVID either. Stop acting like there‚Äôs choice future certain. matter path take you‚Äôre dealing uncertain future, get fear behind that, doesn‚Äôt apply vaccine. Unfortunate reality close schools, would mean parents can't go work either impacts businesses.

But year prepare better precautions schools like isolated classes, staggered breaks, hybrid options on. Poor thing. last public act loving meant help people fence getting vaccinated. think honorable.  believe using case. #/100k children population. include cumulative hospitalization rate (#/100k) % hospitalizations per case make sense. ~5M cases kids hospitalization rate ~1.5 kids 100k **with** Covid would total ~75 hospitalizations. Yes, antibody response still works delta, however mutations come antibodies weaken time, little 6 months seeing, vaccine becomes less effective. covered early-august authorization 3rd dose immune compromised intervals, sit tight FDA &amp; CDC sort what's necessary.    early know, look NYT graph US, cases rising much slower before. wait, people accounts seem interested defending CCP assured China donated much US! saying may entirely truthful??? likely FDA approval 12-15 year olds come November 21 deadline school district set, doesn't, deadline delayed.

Most/many EU countries accept American vaccine cards entry country. UK accepts American cards entry - US residents. know someone another country flew US got vaccinated, US card accepted get UK since US resident.

France accepts US cards entry also offers service convert US vaccine card EU QR code, they're far behind trip probably end get around giving QR code.

Most, all, EU countries let take covid test every 72 hours receive temporary QR code, accepted everywhere. So, get hotels, restaurants, etc. Lmao like u afford travel anyways Like said, *some states.* Take look cases vs hospitalizations places like [New cases rose gently, hospitalizations failed rise proportions prior outbreaks (although rise). look county-specific data -- toggle ""% Vaccinated"" vs ""Risk Level"" state's county map -- see clear negative correlation, worst-hit counties least vaccinated. Without many unvaccinated people running around, wave would've much, much smaller. people acquire immunity surviving infection, counties behave like vaccinated ones, especially clear Michigan severe outbreak back April. Check Thumb counties examples that, specifically Huron, Sanilac, St. Claire.

Several prominent experts predict Delta final significant covid wave US, question long tail fall/winter. Nobody I've seen expects winter bad last winter. That's covid running immunologically naive bodies. really almost this. What's there's sizeable portion (per FDIC, \~7mil households) remains totally unbanked, either distrust banks, form ID etc. often find people cashing checks places like Walmart (for fee) operating day-to-day solely using cash. 

If need make purchases online, often they'll use reloadable prepaid debit card, also fee associated reloading it.  Define shortage / supply - rate production vs drawing stockpile... think point  think they're counting *donated* doses, instead sold doses? remember (in China Africa Podcast?) China *selling* doses (with tiny minority donated), portraying donations. sound like real asshat saying losing respect group workers suffered time period, caring people got sick virus even vaccines. I'm assuming way mask mandates happened last time, get rid cases transmission slows crawl.   willing get vaccinated. vaccinated unwilling wear mask. comply mask mandate. willingly.  exhausted working, covid itself. don‚Äôt understand question.. plenty want raise. getting vax doesn‚Äôt get raise..

I sincerely mind blown dedication multiple conspiracy theories spewed accounts. 7 day Positivity rate 6.5% though, hopefully sign lower case numbers here.  even think matters holds court not.

The big employers (Wal-Mart, Amazon, Target, etc) probably problem mandate wanted issue one. Full approval, plus this, push needed. expect issue vax mandates soon they'll keep matter happens court.

Smaller companies overwhelmingly fall one two camps:

Some like big employers mentioned - wanting mandate anyways, push needed.

Some probably give shit. least, teams lawyers pick finer details Biden's mandate prior case law determine legal, certainly team lawyers fight like it. threat OSHA fines, may may able afford, enough scare mandate.

I think small number companies try fight it, may find crackpot lawyer represent free (is Rudy busy? still practice?), time goes anywhere court, big boys issued vaccine mandates employees handful small businesses pushing back really affect overall vax rates. ""100% increase"" mean doubling

This concordant 2x 200% original. 200% 100% increase 100%. (x + x) already happening areas. companies universities require either vaccination weekly testing. yes hassle, know much smaller hassle?

Also made 6 gallons drinking water bunch stuff weekend. high profile people get vaxx maybe it‚Äôll time trickle actually works hope  people still get

This inaccurate technically; I'd say get it. largest effect vaccination *is* prevent infection. There's secondary, smaller effect vaccination reduce severity infected.

In trials looked symptomatic disease; there's data suggesting difference asymptomatic rate vaccination thing.

You've seen many headlines early claiming ""100% efficacy hospitalization death"". always lies, based small sample sizes taken context without credible interval (in Pfizer trial, instance, 8 cases 0 hospitalizations vaccine group, versus 162 cases several hospitalizations placebo group).

In real-world [UK vaccinated people 80-90% less likely test positive, (based over-50s), 70% less likely hospitalized die do. Every sufficiently-large sample size data consistent this.

In Massachusets somewhat similar: 600 fully vaccinated positive tests day 1600 total. Fully vaccinated people 66% population account 36% cases, making (66 / 36) / (34/64) = 3.5x risk ratio 70% efficacy testing positive.

There's one factor keep mind near future though: we're longer comparing vaccinated unvaccinated+uninfected, comparing vaccinated unvaccinated increasingly infected recovered. continues, account would expect vaccine efficacy approach zero recovery confers similar protection vaccination include entire unvaccinated population comparison. point better comparison would percentage vaccinated vs unvaccinated infection (N) antibodies. Good There‚Äôs lot process there. seem like legit padding stats type bullshit, tweeter loses lot credibility poking fun legit deaths line duty. 

I think wants mean ‚Äúshot blaze glory chasing bad guys‚Äù reality you‚Äôre running street work clock get hit drunk driver - that‚Äôs legitimately dying line duty. patrol squad car t-bone someone runs red light die, that‚Äôs dying line duty. she‚Äôs almost making fun people way company work reported death doesn‚Äôt sit well and, again, makes lose lot credibility. 

I‚Äôm fan police, yeah cop drowned day beach whatever shouldn‚Äôt considered ‚Äúin line duty‚Äù can‚Äôt really get behind logic lot scrolled.  said Polio came out? can‚Äôt trust vaccine medical science?

What side affects COVID? certainly blame France move, sadly, think going motivate lot US unvaccinated get vaccinated. probably never left home state ever left hollow. Le ban! People getting news facts TikTok encourage people get vaccinated I'm it.  provinces already allowing (as well allowing got mixed vaccines need get another countries don‚Äôt recognize mixed vaccines yet). Waiting outside pharmacy third dose appointment time moment! (AZ + Pfizer another Pfizer). based saying would expected first child's death earlier this, especially county almost 300K residents. Dude get vaccinated got vaccinated they'll get vaccinated problem... No. It‚Äôs whole number cases. That‚Äôs way read unvaccinated 4.5 times likely contract virus, 10 times likely hospitalized virus, 11 times likely die disease.

I would bet number unvaccinated hospital deaths much higher 11 times number vaccinated hospital deaths.  people leave don‚Äôt want vaccine. people take jobs get raises. Good!! I‚Äôm glad hear honestly. know things change daily comes Covid knows timeline I‚Äôm operating right now. reason continuing [the unvaccinated filling Let 'em leave.

Every time look Florida's data always trending down, come back look week later higher previous week. always back dating cases always looks like trending down. verify vaccine card valid? they've already been... weed california Yes, following events early Wuhan, reason anyone could think would disaster quarantine everyone coming in. China, initially, Europe, quarantine returning Europe. believe thousands pouring JFK, one even tied T-shirt around face. sick college students returning Italy went airport authorities JFK (expecting quarantined, pretty sure Covid), one JFK clue do, told converned people coming China (what matter people?) students called CDC. Whoever reached told continue home city, there, contact local public health. got airplanes wherever, infecting people. 

Watching unfold horrified. Trump's idea quarantining returnees unused military barracks 2 weeks good one, get far FDA figure manage it. apparently Public Health thought ""wasn't necessary"". Apparently thought virus would act differently China Italy. supposedly wonderful health care system could handle it. 

There lot government ineptitude handling one things expect government handle get organized. CDC seemed take attitude early need ""overreact"". tragedy good life insurance agent's business. Oh good This. important keep mind different studies result slightly different numbers. set results also confidence intervals often overlap results. I'll give example, Virginia's dashboard provides information weekly basis.

And, saying less patients showing agitation sign possible serotonin release related reaction (it caused reasons, though.)


Potential reasons these:

* Faster infection replication causing worse reaction 1st stage?

* pronounced syncytium formation resulting faster progression &amp; problem?

* Somehow, megakaryocyte - platelet axis resulting- serotonin release happening ? (I'm sure all, but...)


* people anti-Covid-19 antibodies, 2nd stage happening 1st stage mixed 1st stage, making things even chaotic resistant (a bit like 2nd stage severe Covid-classic)?



For many already anti-Covid-19 antibodies, IgG &amp; IgM helpful.


But may bad glycosylation profile anti-bodies receptors, cannot clear resulting immune complex efficiently enough. so, IVIG FcRn blocker type things might helpful, much earlier Covid-classic.


Are new studies Delta? Goddamn fuck people  gave fairly long reply delves natural vs. vaccine immunity, however, missed context question much simpler answer:

Documentation.

Requiring vaccination allows people demonstrate exactly immunity arises well studied breakthrough infection rates outcomes.

If also allow natural immunity, need person prove infected covid, strain, *their* immunity least good vaccine-provided immunity, research may eventually give us necessary statistics there, yet it.

Vaccination status much easier prove ""I infected degree protection vaccine"", least time being. Vaccines mandatory though. Go ahead get vaccine. understand consequences.

[Source Pfizer submits application kid vaccine end month, optimisticly looking October shots given, later? month since mask rules came play one could say mask rules lowered cases. Florida would need 3 million people become infected herd immunity since R-Naught Delta high. given? Refuse job, don‚Äôt get paid. gets pipe fuck yet we're still allowed talk politics despite major factor. 100% success rate far self made vaccine, what's stats yours? I'm happy sell mine billions dollars it'll help fellow man. believe research we're seeing natural immunity quite specific strain caught help nearly much strains, unlike vaccines.

In addition, believe comparing waning protection people since they'd taken vaccines months ago coming needing booster.

I'm sure this, believe also component comparing natural immunity + vaccine vs. vaccine, could misunderstood part.

So covers re-infection - absolutely valid important aspect immunity need track, slow spread covid.

However, there's also severity disease aspect. great data secondary infections, quite reports people who've caught covid twice second infection far, far worse first.

This makes sense consider people's reactions second dose vaccine worse first.

There's speculation antibodies one strain covid actually make *more* susceptible different strain covid, still needs investigated proven.

What known natural immunity make subsequent infection less severe, unlike vaccines.

The tl;dr here:

 - Natural immunity may effective vaccines, specific strain. research needed confirm claims.
 - Vaccines provide protection severity covid infection, natural immunity not. research needed confirm.
 - Natural immunity may actually amplifying severity second covid infection infection different strain. research needed confirm.

The biggest thing missing large-N statistical data protections bias data selection really speak whether outliers true Plenty new research suggest...

New research great, definitely helps prime us things, always needs confirmed, replicated, expanded upon. always take grain salt. word choice used - ""suggest"" - exactly that.

There indications something might true, confirmation needed. handle new research? believe prudence important:

 - new research suggests safety measure may warranted thought specific situations, makes sense continue safety measure confirmed - wrong, people harmed.
 - new research suggests there's danger horizon mitigating, treat research true take appropriate mitigation measures confirm - again, right anything, people harmed. nurses quitting hospital wife works vaccine mandate.

Sure ""research"" away. barracks, that's got 7 vaccines day one basic training never heard anyone much ask for. sudden soldiers refusing... hmm  Lol calm down, Im vaccinated already that's problem. problem government telling people bodies, goes abortion, let people decide bodies. suffers someone getting vaccinated, surely ones vaccinated right?  mean hell, private school work at, immunization records required. ain‚Äôt public. started Reagan revived concept trust government. That, emptied mental health faciliities onto streets. Delete facebook. Politics always gets way humanitarian issues. always public health matter. I'm quite convinced would dealt now. Well, require employees get tests go work unvaccinated. would imagine unvaccinated workers can't afford that, terms time money. seems like roulette get fucked vaccine not. 

I heard similar another poster said usually feel bad one shots, both. Well first Moderna fucked day after. got second Moderna yesterday kinds fucked even went bed yesterday. 

But honestly, see good people small price pay potential save another, several other, lives.     Denmark less 10% doesn‚Äôt want vaccine, US 20% - unless something drastically happens people‚Äôs willingness vaccinate, it‚Äôs hard US approach Denmark‚Äôs numbers. outside USA seems needed, rest world getting vaccinated without forced death rates dropping That's great companies give something resembling fuck employees. Unfortunately many companies like treat workers like numbered sacks flesh.

For instance, mine offered time get shot(s), system paid time react negatively shot(s), financial incentive (IE: 100$ bonus) get shot(s).

At end day however really surprise slightest. company brought us PPE *once* entire pandemic also require us wear face masks even though mandated state.   Norway Denmark politicians don‚Äôt power lock keep restrictions unless it‚Äôs necessary. Denmark pandemic control impact health care manageable. Norway bit behind vaccination, probably follow path Denmark. Also ""I antivaxx"". bullshit. people saying antivaxx ones saying vaccines cause autism Nope, still choice, remember certain choices consequences. Get vaccinated, pay pocket tests, quit.   reinfection provides significant boost immune system comparable 3rd shot/booster. little risk infectee.

Ah ok, first time I've heard admit logic.

For record, seen two studies quantifying severity outcome third infection two doses like they're talking about. agree hospitalization death less likely, much less clear common long covid might reinfection waning immunity two-dose vaccine affect ability protect outcome; vaccine reported reduce risk long covid half current studies right now. Given common long covid is, UK reported *debilitating* long covid occur 1-5% infections (before vaccine think), personal level comfort think I'm going take chances reinfection, chance disabled months (or even permanently) could still around 2%. workplace (a preschool) requires vaccines masks teachers school property.

We pushback. really care others, handle minor inconvenience. I've gotten really good deep-throating Unless expecting assassination this, seems like weird idea. lot base going find clear evidence democrats republicans play different lipservice. Plenty apathetic people excited, mad never going support Biden anyways. tiny lives swapped excellent exchange rate creating votes. Disgusting. break ginger!

No, seriously, term ""gingerly"" (possibly) came used stick ginger root old horses' asses make pert lively. logic, one prove anyone wrong future prediction, they? really making argument here.   think pretty fucking hilarious cop saying problems solved talking force. According US, syrians israelians caucasian, jesus also white according standards. That's syrian terrorists described white certain news sources Perhaps. probably not. 

Children already 3, 4, 5 shot series. simply know enough covid vaccine know many shots original series be. 2 guess get vaccination started quickly possible. may need 3 shots long-term immunity. know many months. 

Also, population gets immunity, cases drop, individual needs less immunity. could get point original series (which know many shots be), get shots unless there's specific outbreak variant pushing people it. 

There's also possibility get new hyper-transmissible variant displaces Delta much less virulent, would like common cold, would also mean we'd care less vaccinating it. Israel huge single payer Healthcare system strict rules centralized data care.

It's much easier get reliable data large cohorts governments. sharp rise. almost flat weeks now. Kerala bad. mean give communist hacks benefit doubt beat Covid Feb 2020  Gonna start selling Pure Romance. Nothing says 'Boss Babe' like throwing vibrator party relatives neighbors.

'Grandma, think want one less horsepower. know miss Grandpa, might embarrassing ER visit.'  Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) EU producing LOTS vaccine doses, they're already bought countries. Since EU countries struggled get enough doses first (large parts domestic production exported countries), recently reached point felt comfortable donate doses developing countries, much like Canada.  You‚Äôre wrong here. Sweden never ‚Äùstayed open‚Äù economy. did, didn‚Äôt work. 

But many people, without expertise epidemiology, *assume* Sweden, Norway, Denmark *exact* outcome pandemic, things equal. That‚Äôs ridiculous. best epidemiologists planet virtually clueless predicting dynamics pandemic, yet people seem think predict outcome Scandinavian countries based off‚Ä¶what, hair color language?    info percent unvaxxed, vaccine?

What exactly battle fight refer to? 

It boggles mind think healthcare worker believes right interface regularly sick individuals without themself taken effective measure available protect themself patients. Losing weight sustainable way process takes years people morbidly obese. Getting vaccinated takes hour two.

There definitely large focus reducing obesity. solve current acute health crisis. People get vaccine help pandemic work overall health they're better suited survive next one (because obesity risk factor covid-19, risk factor many diseases). true. wonder many people legitimately die hard refuse vaccine, many people haven‚Äôt gotten yet convenience reasons also get vaccinated cannot lower risks contracting covid.

Hopefully FDA give emergency approval results released.  less 30% vaccinated rate live.  counties away, school district 26% vaccination profile.  yes, areas anti vaxxers majority Covid last year got vaxxed spring felt pretty safe natural immunity vaccine booster.

News: Biden signs executive order mandating vaccines federal workers

Facebook next day: Illegitimate ""president"" Biden signs Communist contract forcing freedom loving Americans guinea pigs chip implant device! countries EU able produce them? Given BioNTech German company, would assume produce vaccines. UK (not EU anymore) AstraZenica vaccine. assume France gotten manufacturing one way another. wonder patent issues could limiting countries size Norway smaller able locally produce vaccines, may easier buy vaccines places like UK Germany. Trifecta!  didn‚Äôt even know Biden could this. hasn‚Äôt done earlier?

waiting vaccine get FDA approval. true. WHO's analysis based mishandling pandemic early stages, current state affairs. 

The main obstacle eradication? virus mutating unvaccinated populations. (a lot) people willing get vaccinated, virus would able mutate fast. Vaccines continue improve vaccine efficacy/distribution get *ahead* virus mutation instead lagging way *behind* said unvaccinated populations, eradication becomes possible.

Nonetheless, concede *is* unlikely given current state affairs. However think vaccine mandate would give least US fighting chance breeding ground future lethal, transmissible variants. Alberta, Canada 70.1 percent population 12+ fully vaccinated chief medical officer planned lift restrictions stop testing/tracing thought ready learn live Covid endemic.

In last month since precautions set revoked, increased ICU hospitalizations 135 percent normal capacity rising. 

Our healthcare system pushed limits people seem reluctant obey future reintroduction restrictions. hard put genie back bottle.

I sure hope goes lot better here, doubt it. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Edit: know I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted let clarify. isn‚Äôt vaccine. issue it. don‚Äôt want government able tell can‚Äôt do. offend you‚Ä¶ good. smallpox vaccine allowed still repeatedly contract spread smallpox, current covid vaccines do, would never eradicated

The finding smallpox-like rashes Egyptian mummies suggests smallpox existed least 3,000 years. Smallpox unique infectious disease ever eradicated....because distinct characteristics, i.e. incubation period, time initial infection visible symptoms, relatively short, prevents disease spreading undetected.  Also, smallpox obvious. That's tracked people remote areas planet.  


Smallpox eradicated full-on GLOBAL vaccine campaign long, complex....and finally successful.  


People walking around grocery store asymptomatic smallpox unvaccinated like covid.  


YOu reallly get whole concept well you.  Yeah fuck anyone rightfully questions vaccine came less 6 months ago! won‚Äôt. get fake cards. seriously thinking setting pro Bono service drafting medical directives people like refuse get unvaccinated. Straight ""I trust medical industry long unvaccinated wish directive taken hospital doctor get treatment event develop symptoms related COVID-19""

Put money mouth is. overblown real problems signing this. nothing else I'm really hoping drop interest rates.

They can't anything private loans nearly federal loans already forgiveness option(PSLF, TEPSLF, PAYE, REPAYE, etc) seems like logical option. replying guy said could eradicate covid, would never happen even everyone double vaxxed. left Idaho 15 never looked back. 21 years ago safely say made right decision. Personally identifying information actually global reddit rules.   Yeah Portland's mayor massive sack shit always caves PPB, I'm sure they're indicative. mixture Ted's cowardice PPB non-zero chance executing street makes extreme case. tried read I'm sure grasp all.

I covid early year hesitant vaccine since natural immunity now. I'm still uncertain think/feel.  company fucking made burn vacation time whne side effects vaccine. think individual might lying 'lost loved ones Covid'.  EU never stopped countries buying vaccines thus exported production. couple weeks ago reported exported 700 million vaccine doses, putting biggest exporter world (with China number 2). Furthermore, production capacity reported come online recently deliveries EU slowing, stands reason pace exports going up. that's fail legal challenge. OSHA required PPE must supplied employer. 
  brass balls guy! Respect. anti-vaxxers, he‚Äôs basically saying ‚Äúfuck freedom, public health safety. Stop selfish.‚Äù

Just like seatbelts mandated. illegal yell fire movie theater ‚Äúbomb‚Äù airport. Drunk/stoned driving outlawed. 

Your freedom something something ends affects others safety/health. Get vaccines. clarification really necessary:

1) Critical society formal designation reserved diseases immediately may cause failure critical societal structures. political decision, comes advice Danish healthcare authorities. regarded generally dangerous disease, placing category things like plague, pandemic flu ebola. words, certainly still considered dangerous.

2) Critical society means loads restrictions introduced easily health ministers alone. Fewer possibilities unilateral restrictions exists classified generally dangerous diseases, still some, including visitor restrictions e.g. nursing homes, closure schools, required isolation, travel restrictions, etc.

3) mean other, general restrictions specific diseases critical society impossible? No, change classification announced couple weeks ago health minister clearly noted would hesitate introduce restrictions necessary. However, whereas health minister formerly could things (a political council actually introduced months ago), get majority support parliament. people unfamiliar Danish politics decisions Danish parliament pandemic, promiss something serious happen, like pending potential breakdown Danish healthcare system, would respond time. Well one, vaccines actually work preventing diseases meant to. people accepting mandate vaccine prevent spread contraction disease beyond me. last time checked, vaccines required majority private business, public sector...

Regardless, OHSA separate government entity must make decisions itself. Allowing president EO types mandates type precedents people bitched Trump 4 years. 

""But hes emergency"" well agree disagree that. government declaring emergency *must* take immediate action force mandate government allowed go work uninterrupted entire pandemic, allowing full venues sporting events, allowing unelected health officials dictate government policy.

I'll give one thing: God, love see this.  gonna drive morons positions trust. It‚Äôs executive order. votes required. challenged legislative/judicial branch, doubt happen. wonder decision go bold influenced recent abortion controversy deciding party going go bold, sit idly gently asking people yet please get vaccine stop killing neighbors economy.  Blah blah. Race bait elsewhere. 40% sick live alongside 60%.  Unemployment qualification based employment contracts.  Facts. work lost people went mask mandates non-vaccinated people. Tough titty. Yeah. remember reading case thinking probably more, whether masks vaccines. start immediately beefing security

Wtf, love cops now?     Lol wear mask go? gone grocery shopping either? understand like severely immuno compromised ffs go outside.  Mask mandates workplace safety policy. Vaccine mandates health measure taking outside work.

I can‚Äôt see standing. OSHA could regulate health policies could fine people obese creating workplace safety hazards. lot paying taxes it, taxes collected problem benefitting them. Like people grumble tax, still use roads. tax already collected there's use protesting anymore. Won‚Äôt get far many Canadian employers requiring mandatory vaccinations too. provinces biggest employer - provincial healthcare - requires employees contracted workers vaccinated, example. quit get fired cause (which refusing job requirement is), get unemployment anyway.

Depends state company contests claim. state, fired, file, company contest claim, get unemployment. Many companies contest for-cause termination, all. Way constitutional Vietnam war draft. Nice. Job openings people want part society fine give take. exact last thing world needs another Beachbody coach. I‚Äôd rather roll dice get 70 COVID shots joined one scams. understood cases may rising amount hospitalisation low due vaccinations. 

Obviously still risk can‚Äôt vaccinated however majority people vaxed happy take risk go maskless attend pubs/clubs etc think so, vaguely remember friend used work part government take sort OHSA safety course related working home allowed so. highlights include weren‚Äôt allowed hang anything doorways. Yes? Absolutely? HPV definitely contagious deadly. round rhombus-er   I‚Äôm abusing all. I‚Äôm giving power choice. notice didn‚Äôt refuse hospitalized got sick. changed mind became seriously ill. pass already? considered new laws right? AKA fuck around, find Crazy people working companies 15 plus years willing give years earned benefits pay. Number two, make so! It‚Äôs that, fact employees might feel unwell enough vaccination require day two work. Frankly apply companies regardless size. employees vaccinated important possible financial losses company might incur people take time so. Something taking long design mean anything whatsoever.

Especially working full knowledge.

Because time vaccine development started covid isolated, looked microscopes, analyzed works fully sequenced.


So knew unique bit can't change much without making virus unable infect humans.

Leaving specific decisions table regarding produce bit deliver immune system.

And mRNA really good tells cells build specific protein specific protein.


So tech really easy adapt anything want also way targeted stuff old tech. we'll seeing lot mRNA vaccines next decades.


Also normal permit emergency one work Boeing WA fucking people dumb. people 10 years career saying they‚Äôre gonna quit. people started (it‚Äôs really hard get Boeing, took year applications, years) they‚Äôre talking quitting. I‚Äôm surrounded idiots. We‚Äôre teaming insurance companies now?    Kind wondering construction worker. imagine majority employees actually independent contractors might even hundred actual employees staff.  Yeah government can‚Äôt legally that. It‚Äôs states‚Äô responsibility. can‚Äôt legally push fed.  went accidental rabbit hole Instagram tRutHerS convinced entire thing government control deception ‚Äúnever get vaxxed‚Äù. you‚Äôre ever bored, check @dontmetalwithme @macrowley IG. vocally anti-vax, also don‚Äôt believe dinosaurs ever existed actually really went outer space. They‚Äôre TRIP! I‚Äôve told workers I‚Äôll pay time go get shot pay 8 hours work next day even go Friday working week. Vaccine mandates sort held similar circumstances court past. School districts, VA hospitals, sorts government entities require people vaccinations utilize services.  ridiculous people vital society get paid jack shit spit people. Society would literally fall apart without guys. think great. Anti vaxxers clogging hospitals Healthcare workers burning out. Something done. Even better! agree. We‚Äôve reached stage pandemic extreme policy decisions without legislation feel completely top. 

As Roger Bernier CDC said hurricane Katrina, ‚Äú‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure believe democracy America. don‚Äôt make good use people. don‚Äôt make good efforts access public wisdom public policy choices.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm fully aware community agree mandate fully vaccinated, however, always aim buy-in people. it‚Äôs still infinitely cooler comirnaty saw stories USPS getting pass this. 

Does anyone know that‚Äôs about? Would stupid skip them.   done *can't* individual mandate federal level. federal government power regulate individual behavior (called ""The Police Power""), states do. 

The Federal government could offer states extra money implementing individual mandates, that's uniform drinking age, feds can't order people something. reading ""new"" comments announcement mandatory vaccines TESTING thing. watched news conference understood ONE FORCED GET VACCINE. Govt. workers quit, private sector folks get tested week. 

Those two simple facts LOST huge group people. 

Then there's people still think covid tests cost money?!?! possible year??? amazing stupid people must be??? assumed pfizer's EUA ended got FDA approval. EUA full FDA approval not? nuance display overwhelming. going end like flu shot. Delta eventually go away. think strains look like. mean could wrong flu Spanish flu. hope covid become. think endgame. Ted Cruz reelection 2024  realize anyone getting 3rd shots already, thought still 'we're thinking it' phase. RATATOULLE!!! AHHH!!!!! Plenty times. Rapid PCR tests. mean it‚Äôs unpleasant seconds surgery. wife isn‚Äôt bothered either probably also supports speeding tickets would opposed cops immediately shoot face go 1mph speed limit. wages already increased I'm loving it. Didn‚Äôt wear mask, didn‚Äôt debt since lockdown, kept freedoms, better mental health since lockdown lower deaths world. Swedish strategy success you‚Äôre mad it.

Dude, guys 17.8 times amount deaths Norway twice population. Sweden utterly failed response coronavirus Norway still free country, ridiculous statement. country used example do. pardon mods, but...

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO government resources spent wasted this. cost tests borne tested. It‚Äôs incentivize people get vaccine. vaccinated still spread (albeit lower rate) much better chance going hospital, dying (the vaccinated getting sick). People Hospital causing waste government time resources. long time ago. Pretty much 100% deaths hospitalization since April preventable. getting point either make unvaccinated suffer consequences via job loss, inability leave country, attend sporting events/concerts, etc. start denying service hospitals. think try former first. real test going next school year. time vaccine approved children. 100% guarantee schools require it. guess unvaccinated plenty time home school thier children sine they‚Äôll unemployed I've definitely known people field related fields think they're smartest people whole damn world. tickets Orlando show. knew coming still sad hear it. I've loved years, comedy got hard time life never got chance see live. Can‚Äôt get tested weekly instead? Nah, expect provide own. budget ;)  Nah. thing personal responsibility. fucking idiot that, died. her. refer famous Atlantic article Cruelty Poin**t  supporters find community rejoicing suffering hate fear. cousin, NURSE, quit job going move ACROSS COUNTRY friends family, one two states mandate vaccines healthcare workers, this. BASED BIDENPILLED Sweet card! know understand logic, certainly taken huge leap people insist stomping feet saying ""*they* though!"". important right now?

When house burning down, stand look someone blame setting fire? fucking something first, worry shit later. longer care . want held hostage longer minority. go where? Open OF? Yeah, that‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand. know need get everyone vaccinated hopefully stop people dying easily seems like Biden others making everyone vaccinated would it‚Äôs far it.

We horrible shape compared last year much didn‚Äôt like Trump least something combat Covid/finances. Biden hasn‚Äôt done toot vaccine horn almost completely ignored virus. thought voting would come take seriously he‚Äôs brushing rug far I‚Äôm concerned. taking northwest imperative heart. Interesting take welfare.  I‚Äôve seen get tested 3-5 days exposure you‚Äôre right might enough time. Maybe could inform whoever invited see would want do. Fair point. thinking antibiotic resistance comparison. Yea not.
 Unemployment money good wallgreens near google ""walgreens covid test"" it'll take need go over, literally dont even ask insurance payment. ever gotten tested?  less contagious Delta, it‚Äôs going hard time competing. board continually mock easily manipulated others?

Because help spread deadly disease kills people care makes us live lockdowns. willingly, arrogantly gleefully. like get what's coming them. even end get last word, pay medical bills. unbelievable Government overreach, put lot employers tough position, especially unions. Regardless feel vaccine, I'm unsure anyone approve types mandates. similar horrible laws passed Texas. last part issue. Literally separation private sector public federal level. straight coercion executive branch zero congressional authority. don‚Äôt care President, Republican Democrat‚Ä¶ abuse executive branch struck down. go Congress point blank simple. FYI fully vaccinated states please, President hold unilateral power. group people complaining people returning work even wages won‚Äôt sufficient income? would ironic. testing mandate. 100 million workers vaccinated. requirement test week. deep nose one definitely unpleasant. Idk would call painful swab sticks waaaay deeper nose accustomed things going. eyes teared every time.

Its like hitting funny bone. exactly painful like happens. We‚Äôve tried Alberta, Canada. Let tell $100 stupidity doesn‚Äôt change mind unfortunately‚Ä¶ since spread attaching water droplets breath, spreads better tropical climates? water air somehow? go back? 
HOW GO BACK!?!?

Legit though entire generation people raised world without Polio Smallpox. We've seen lethality Varicella Z, Measles, Rubella, Mumps... drop enormously. Nobody see iron lung unless visit museum (which fair we'd advanced tech still demand scale before.) 

What insane regression human mind befallen us people looking (in US) \~650,000 dead people saying ""More please!"" normal. 

I definitely picked wrong timeline work mental health + medical fields. God dammit... also help. mandated specific roles though justification high exposure risk like colleges require vaccines required high school living campus. much different broad across board everyone must comply generalized threat public health hope rough, flu shots usually kick ass bit De mechanics proof date tetanus vaccine? RV techs Hep vaccines? least Canada do.   Regulating individual behavior, including expectations public health, part Police Power, Federal government have. 

This why, example, federal minimum drinking age, would illegal federal government regulate people's behavior way. (instead offer bonus money states use *their* police power make 21) doctor doesn't, unfortunately. OSHA apply state local governments unless state adopts standards separately. Schools, police, etc. affected this. still choose make.  started getting flu vax 2nd run it. son brought home wife I. 1 bathroom share time. week lived saltine crackers water/sprite.

The first time flu around 10 fever 102. ever want again.

As baby (just months old) got pneumonia father smoker. suffer life chronic bronchitis illness. Every year would go doctor least one bronchitis flair (brought severe sinus infections). I've bronchitis since 2019 masks helped much. year got bad sinus infection went got chest. believe covid would painful death got without vaccine. pain even worse life long side effects seems worse death me. 

Fuck bronchitis. sucks. never ending cough, weight chest, struggling breathe, hacking fluid, yeah want anymore. too!! Excited Welp support boys blue right? Utterly ridiculous comment. 
The "" im fully vaccinated"" lovely way. Bruh second one fineüò≠ ‚ÄúMake employees get vaccine business neutered‚Äù.  one forcing vaccine, free quit gov. job. private sector job free get vax test weekly. 

Again, ONE FORCING VACCINE. said caps understand actually going on.   think depends state. know college games capacity limits, required vaccination status, didn‚Äôt give fuck.  lose lot knowledge people close retirement age refuse this. absolutely affect production overall. Mu employees? Weekly testing. company probably make pay though. seems fairly reasonable. ITA. close friend former colleague works Methodist Hospital System Texas, national news requiring vaccination. Twenty-five (25) people protesting in-house mandate went ahead got shot, rather lose jobs. So, 153 quit fired, almost 26,000 got shot. 


Methodist 4.2 Glassdoor routinely lands top rankings employers *Houston Business Journal.* promise Houston-based health system used work kind loyalty, also much crappier place seen (I've treated two Methodist facilities patient: driven half hour seen rather somewhere else).  


But people screamed hollered getting shot want believe greener pastures worth dumping good job for. logic government go ahead crank disincentive threatening jail anyone get vaccine?

By logic, would good idea. right untill OSHA thank you! parents (antivax/antimask) telling would coming pocket could push vaccine worried ngl. really wish could get vaccine- want it- can‚Äôt risk tbh. kinda hope work (walmart) weekly rapid tests smth tbh cause i‚Äôve scares turned cold/rhino/rsv tried buy home kit stay sold  wonder applies contractors. Yes. job can't done safely certain body type, OSHA requires physical demands part job description, implies mandate Employer force person change body type leave, else get safer equipment. Lol there‚Äôs gonna 10% less conservatives time election roles in‚Ä¶ see.  created lab using Mu‚Äôs DNA   majority love biden today. He's great need. dont want vaccine go get tested week stop baby. precedent coercing every employee works company employees get vaccinated?  Vaccine mandates really popular, actually. something like 70% adults USA least partially vaccinated. Anti-vax people small minority right now, they‚Äôre really loud.  ban air travel? think correct move administration, least staunchly anti-vax people really good employees, large numbers walk sure impact production lot companies. I'm guessing number actually walk much, much smaller number thus far refused get vaccinated, potential concern. employees vaccinated, lost ones without lot notice, would painful. Yea, negative exposed last couple days don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd able pop positive yet. consequence people incentivized go work sick. puts others danger families need fed. weekly negative test simply fucking good enough point.   kept failing upper level graduate course Advanced Common Sense government refusing support; simply providing it. reason support provided either government specifically gave it, companies did.  12 might still able get without parents. I‚Äôm sure laws Here's problem. fucking concerts fairs opened across country. spreading much? many people need want gather large venues tens thousands people. people fucking stopped playing 5 5 bball park going concerts thousands people we'd much better place. Herd immunity bullshit. Vaccines showing less effective time. answer obvious anyone brain instead scream vaccine vaccine rubbing elbows strangers sweating singing along favorite songs. cognitive dissonance astounding.  Cured (mostly) phobia donating blood every 8-10 weeks many many years. Even moved platelet donations. Well see lot signs McDonalds fast food places hiring. Make sure point direction. company 2013 closed shop covid hit. Sales declined less less people going shows, overall fun... easy one might think manufacture run company selling artisan, micro batch hot sauces.

My favorite ones make raspberry vanilla reaper sauce could put ice cream cake, south-Charleston bbq sauce red habaneros touch heat :) vaccine costs roughly $20 per dose manufacturing government paying. state nothing. Look washington state Oregon, states kicked feds multiple times trying things people states deemed legal, federally illegal.  Fox told think yet. aren‚Äôt mandating vaccine. choice test well. That‚Äôs headlines crap.  kept typing facebook ""death covid vaccine"" found group re-enforced opinion. people ""research"" are, Pre-Covid, cold removed sense smell even. slightly different different 'species' coronavirus will. IIRC, called beta-coronaviruses, SarsCOV2 alpha type. First all, obesity considered disability. 

But importantly, yes fire people disability disability prevents job. think airline pilots go blind still get fly?  mandate healthcare workers get hep shots etc..? would assume rule/law place allows utilized scenarios Speak shitty friends. nurse friends advocate public health guidelines, first line get vaccinated, continue answer stupid peoples questions intelligent, respectful, evidenced based science. isn‚Äôt every single crime violation punished death?  Haha. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm optimistic. I‚Äôm incredibly bitter jaded person. It‚Äôs work world take step back find kind positive whenever read news days. wish employers couldn‚Äôt ask medical info? Absolutely. understand may need it? definitely underlying reason one past 2 years proven enough me. It‚Äôs one know trust me, past 5 years proven that‚Äôs one 100% predict trust. jeep trying find positives things suffer fairly severe suicidal depression don‚Äôt want see what‚Äôs end hole couldn‚Äôt find positive somewhere. 

But truthfully, probably first time I‚Äôve called optimistic since 5 turning 6 said hope get go Disney world birthday dad. response got ‚Äúthat‚Äôs optimistic, likely, optimistic‚Äù yeah, that's i'm edge biden's climate plan. told people cared issue vote someone else. found start seeing universal decline fossil fuel usage global economy 2025. needs done, administration hold white house vice grip. basically cancelled elections forseeable future, democracy wait i'm serious. This! call gasteritis something along lines! hate term stomach flu. Idc he‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm already vaccinated. someone explain legally able this? foresee Supreme Court kicking window tbh. I've met relatives past 2 years, that's grandma pass away need hold funeral. life death matters, sure valid reason.

But EVERYONE went holiday death issues? Nah. I‚Äôm good upstairs bed. Also please love god stop putting much identity 25 whatever age is.

The government always right, especially you‚Äôre trying strawman way viable argument true.

Yet case, 1/3 population brain damaged echo chambers understand mRNA vaccine works, would prevent deaths, get us back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù faster, know right side history one crybabies sucked worked towards greater good rather act like Neanderthals.

A favorite phrase right, last 4 years especially, ‚Äúif don‚Äôt like it, leave.‚Äù Well here‚Äôs chance! Enjoy eternal depression (like think). wish say true happiness died 2020 ever was... speaking makes think, much mental state influence (ptsd known) Spanish Flu sociopolitics 1920-30 run WW2?   Keep thinking that. I've never met liberal Lineworker. travel states. Everyone know walk job they're forced. They're unions btw. also takes 2 years schooling become certified. That's long time without power men step get power back :) US could see reduction gun violence people stopped shooting other, expert says. no. say anyone right side isle, head spin. never hold current SCOTUS. behavior want ‚Äúnot starving death‚Äù behavior want disincentivize ‚Äústarving death turning life crime starve death‚Äù

What next? Hey, too. problem spreading everybody else want die care do. reason government taking action.   nuts positions already required vaccinations. 

The fact needs mandated nuts.  Well I‚Äôm dumb rocks software engineering. According CDC, alcohol related deaths average 95k year US alone. 

Should force entire country drink now?

Or, using analogy, according CDC, roughly 1,300 tobacco related deaths per day, whopping total 480k tobacco related deaths per year. would mean two days, around amount deaths 9/11, happen tobacco use. Guess need ban too, right?

I'm fully vaccinated, btw. failing realize gross extension power he's trying force private sector. 0.00001% important me.

Before people sides went crazy, good conversation would involve two people coming sort agreement, even minor thing, disagreeing boundaries issue, ideally courteous manner, walking away mutual respect.

I posted simply see possible two people, opposing viewpoints, actually agree one another. 

Clearly difficult, apparently impossible.

I would encourage pick torch - find people opposing viewpoint, find something agree about, matter trivial.

If that, bring world back normalcy üôÇ would happen? positions already mandatory vaccinations. 


What strange take. granted mean forced court decisions massive public outcry sure, capitulated. Make mistake, power ever taken, never given. kind terrible union hates members much? Hmmm Tree Fiddy let it, get full inch back behind outer nasal cavity, sensitivity significantly lower.

CVS Walgreens care, get money either way.   Social welfare programs provide useful invectives. providing workers leverage (i.e. starve without job), employers incentivized provide better working conditions wages. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*     Reported.  still choice, take covid test every week.  Oooh nurses meantime, bunch corporations follow mantate, regardless court battles. Biden knowingly taking fall it.  70% country received least 1 dose. come powerful ""antivax rheoric"" actually work absolute majority? CHOSE antivaxx CHOSE seek antivaxx propaganda re-enforce opinion. 200 employees local REA. Good luck keeping lights :)  Well hope understand entitled unemployment benefits then.  Grundy lmaoo dont mad govt healthcare workers, ppl gonna claim ‚Äúno one wants work‚Äù Like everything else them, tough guy talk folds instant tested. Exactly. wouldn‚Äôt think would apply state employees explicitly, unless 100+ employees hook it. not, may able say state governments interface federal government therefore require it. sure hope shit. XD thing Gulag ~95% ICU patients moment unvaccinated. Even better! know employer cover cost  Omg.. totally right   I'm surprised set 50 though, that's things go effect far I'm aware.  Respect optimism get probably legal even disagree legal way. hope right see going poorly honest followed presidency closely, assumption anyone who's made considered positions highly suspect. aspect campaign subsequent administration made deeply depressed party's direction. I'll save spiel, nice see admin something objectively good even reasons hoped. Materially, we're I'm happy that.  everyone resturants bars vaccinated, break cases may replicating far.

I vaccine mandatory (masks optional) company party 150 people. found 2 days later 1 person infected time mild symptoms days later. Everyone attended got tested, single derivative infection. 

Its clear happen, seems rare improbable one taken one mrna vaccines. ""You can't universal healthcare! forces doctors give away labor literal slavery!!1!""

-Also guy, probably would exhausting live constant state outrage ""socialism"" ""wokeness."" lives must completely suck.

It's gets vote though, despite American conclusion opponents try utilizing outrage importantly fearmongering get base mobilize. sucks IMO there's way

(reply pls) 0 medical exemptions New York. reason can't get vaccine may well suck start shotgun. Good job dems Murder? Little extreme think?   It‚Äôs ‚Äúpositive‚Äù buzzword since ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù used describe anything don‚Äôt like. Words stripped meaning except ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúbad‚Äù Yep. Instead post guards minimum surveillance/recording arrested property damage threatening medical personnel. 12? Well...bye spent couple weeks reading pubmed papers mRNA vaccines. There's nothing wrong research take certain skill duped bullshit. Good question. Maybe already one hand save time shipping waiting results. Here's website info I'm allowed post links here.  mean status quo pretty shitty workers, labor shortage should, *free market* drive labor rates. Supply demand friend. Joke's Biden,

I already got months ago aerospace engineering degree 10 years experience instrument engineer project manager. Also vaccinated. hiring? even bother. Libertarians idiots worth engaging, honestly. kind fucked response that??? like flu, right? Fleeing scene harassing staff, police unions' reactions vaccine requirements indication. read article scheduled get vaccine fell ill couple days appointment. None ""unregulated capitalism""  agree wife! I‚Äôm sorry experiences she‚Äôs gone through. never gotten bad. much support start anymore. One ER nurses work quit many feel wife do.  people fired cause, qualify unemployment violating OSHA policy(testing vaxx) ""keeping students building"" - young age especially, environment peers fundamental. lot kids still reliable internet access, eat meals school, etc. plus, many people fall distraction stuck home day, especially live noisy household.

Parents work links people's lives, nothing exists void. economy never truly overlooked exchange ""people's lives"" people's lives depend it, whether like not. Especially America, class divide already massive - continues worsen things like online school. Many parents also enough stress hands young children home, work home pay bills.

*Closing schools punishment children.* doubt contribute spread - fundamental part society must remain operational especially vaccines. 

And even get started universities charging full tuition online courses, bet even get behind that.  bet bunch exactly 100 worker companies popping anytime soon. I‚Äôm fine that. want lie that‚Äôs A-OK, long get fucking shot. Cause nurses even get work COVID patients. net work disappointing.   get Hep B/TB vacc go paramedicine/firefighting area. assume going similar guideline? Meanwhile across vastness Texas , business owners reduce workforce 99 employees per business. still effectively mandate unless make businesses pay tests. Well, city? No, don‚Äôt quarantine we‚Äôre vaccinated, actually mandated us now. It‚Äôs list situation arise somehow.

We quarantine symptoms wait test results, we‚Äôre exposed positive case. This. smart enough know consequences actions. doesn‚Äôt care. Winning unvaccinated base important saving whole generation kids might suffer long covid. Brave young man, proud. bad unemployment benefits dried months ago us actually gave shit public health ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø second one, government contractors, could include lot people think. work private sector software development, company work technically government contractor according GSA eLibrary.

I'm fully vaccinated 100% favor mandate, wanted point might surprised many companies federal contractors. Yes support know several Libertarians Dems refuse vaccine plenty Republicans got it. think people spreading much disinformation making normally sane rational people scared get blame. reminder could done months ago   shoot, nasal swabs dont work well pcr anyway... gonna anal test. It‚Äôs silly rule - it‚Äôs perfectly safe swab age child. Also ideally test PCR generally come back rapidly. PCR much accurate rapid antigen tests. know Texas many daycares sending kids home runny/stuffy nose. again, it‚Äôs Texas. It‚Äôs also really hard parents quarantine child see doctor every time child gets runny nose, usually every 2 3 weeks child first year daycare. Many parents risk losing job miss much work due child care child sick.    get saying probably fair way make people get vaccine vaccine best bet fight covid wrong risking sore minor flu. 

The risk poorly implemented enforcement shit specifically rural conservative areas. places handle covid keeps mutating things go back normal. extremely reactionary republican government takes next 2 elections shit gets really bad. 

I better solution think actually going change anything make sad take effect? I'm hyped this

My anti Vax boss finally going quit get position $3.20/hr raise odds infected viral load you‚Äôll carry exactly unvaccinated, right?

You‚Äôre right, though. really need perfect solution give us zero COVID cases immediately. something significantly reduce spread climbing death tolls, clear hospital beds people COVID patients, get us much closer semblance herd immunity, give virus significantly less organisms continue mutating in. So, great, tried education encouragement. large contingent population interested selling. try educate people fat, interested. Worse things world disease kills ancient people morbidly obese people. Time move on. Okay, check [Vaccines: Measured hbomberguy. much horrifying ever realized.  I'll take death metal incontinence 500 Would work tests within 72 hours event?   hard science whether immune systems work like this? I've heard lot people talk immune systems like get fat shape ""use"" them, but, outside developing antibodies specific viruses, really benefit? saying there's not, asking data back up. :) Even fully vaccinated right things, certainly get infected definitely unvaccinated spreading this. 

Even birth control right things, certainly get pregnant

It's definitely people bareback sex getting pregnant. 

That's much sense make right now. #newbandname   Well, anyone reading needs test, look pixel. mail test results, might helpful tests hard find. Regardless stance vaccine, anyone actually support this?  Covid scary, even limited data have, shown long-term effects, including clots, lung, brain damage. earth would risk subjecting baby that??  Pardon ignorance, thought extremely strict lockdown?  I‚Äôm mostly phone, thanks tip. I‚Äôll definitely use computer. legal reason 100+ employee issue? know regulations smaller companies exempt, including regarding OSHA, I'm sure this.  Exactly got mine. Wife's employer nurses come office set vaccines. vaccinated something like 300 people course days left over. Since available, went got it.  read tonight postal workers exempt. anyone know why? Doesn‚Äôt seem fair, it?  original trials original virus. (94% &amp; 95%)

Since effectiveness degraded time variants, especially Delta. Moderna currently significantly effective Pfizer J&amp;J running distant third. getting long tooth early adopters, hence booster mania.

I found article surprisingly little value. Conversation articles usually much informative they're written academics vs journalists. you‚Äôre stupid enough quit job won‚Äôt get shot deserve whatever happens that. zero sympathy antivax morons point. We‚Äôre still mess them. Vaccines already mandated students. Genuinely asking, what‚Äôs stop business like 110 employees laying 11 people stay ‚Äúover 100 workers‚Äù requirement? Don‚Äôt get wrong I‚Äôm glad Biden this, make glaring loophole? employers required get workers vaccinated, full stop. jab, job.  kind agree, think Biden't announcement maybe crosses line... Teachers quarantine exposed live? sounds great! children's school call parents automated recording saying ""one children exposed someone tested positive"" time resources watch cameras see long close enforce quarantine unless person tested positive. tell optional quarantine exposed. Blows mind. (Location: AL) I'm excited well! Good luck two! Yeah genuinely value human lives immediate lived ones.  Maybe difference pay pocket compared getting extra payment? 
All insurers need raise rates unvaccinated extent allowed law. persuade people anything else. wonder life insurance started ask proof vaccination yet. Probably not. I'm sure another, ""If X candidate wins I'm moving Canada!"" type threat. Well given 100% guaranteed way avoid covid go desert island, it‚Äôs ridiculous hold employers accountable take every reasonable measure keep employees customers getting it. far vaxxed people getting it, right, oh no, less 2% current covid deaths vaxxed people less 8% current covid positive cases vaxxed people. numbers high it‚Äôs obviously effective enough considered every reasonable accommodation protect employees customers harm. mean, 100% automobile accidents result injury happen cars. obviously car manufacturers making faulty products held directly accountable automobile deaths spite installation safety features like seat belts, airbags, headlights, mirrors reflectors, ABS crumple zones. Obviously things didn‚Äôt work supposed foolproof significantly effective methods protecting people collision car manufactures held accountable. Oh wait, arent better options except ever get car, take inherent risk choosing manufacturers made every reasonable safe choice design. thing vaccine. It‚Äôs best possible option avoid death complications covid. better option getting 2 little shots. requiring it, company protect employees customers. Sure may added effect helping stay staffed keeping people alive shop stay viable company, protecting amount people possible result actually matters policies. 

If motivation something bad, means ends 100% outcome want, gives shit. wanted car could look cool impress friends, saved buying added ability get better job provide family could commute farther away without rely slow public transportation, cares reason wanted originally impress friends one benefiting aspect? 

The vaccine saves lives. Far PPE far bury head sand pretend like covid doesn‚Äôt exist many people fallen into. gives shit Walmart protected lawsuits requiring vaccine testing employees it‚Äôs literally effective option leads results want sacrifice almost nothing sore arm worst 12 hours flu like symptoms generally sleep through.  mean get sick die covid refusing get vaccinated, mean... I'll happy taking job lol Hundred millions vaccines enough?   odds putting vaccinated person hospital covid slim none. You‚Äôre likely kill car accident.

If people want idiots, it. They‚Äôre hurting others. universal vaccination mandate violates individuals right privacy liberty. order company 100 employees, specific business 100 employees? example, McDonald 40 employees need require 40 employees get vaccinated counting McDonald's employees different stores?  There's also FAA huge enforcement apparatus planes necessarily exist forms public transit.

The TSA jurisdiction transit run stupid operations equivalent FAA FTA.  Okay, post COVID, obesity. Try stay track. wondering... Roe v Wade stands 4th amendment rights, government cannot violate privacy forcing something body, government vaccine mandate unconstitutional? want support trouble finding consistency here. course morality plain day, make laws reflect that? Lmao never get hired anywhere? Good riddance. Let broke, sick, miserable. need health insurance medical facilities able deny coverage privatize care vaccinated individuals idiots super spreader events care. I‚Äôm accelerating natural selection. Shit, I'm boycotting, I'm staying fuck away plague lands. 

Those two different things. Aww yis. Gotta get c tuck.   could argued unvaccinated violent spreading disease could potentially cause severe complications death. Love OSHA doing.  
Love United Airlines doing.  
Love companies levy $200 surcharge unvaxxed employees use company's health plan.  
I fully support unvaxxed employees pay weekly covid tests. 
Supreme Court even EEOC ruled private companies require vaccines.  


Considering global pandemic US seen 400% increase covid infections fact hospitals filled up, seems like common sense (unless nutcase conspiracy type) .......I wish could happened soon vaccines available lacking FDA approval time.  


Every day, thankful smallpox pandemic, feared disease planet.  KNOW anti-vaxxer, covid denier, anti maskers would thing smallpox pandemic covid virus. Please don‚Äôt take live events. first close last open. already sacrificed everything. OSHA make employees pay anything else related safety like this? business. Employees don‚Äôt pay training inspections related OSHA despite benefits receive them

This isn‚Äôt vaccinated not, cost shouldn‚Äôt fall individual. Give company incentive fire instead putting burden individual. think everyone vaccinated kid anyone go foster care? system nightmare.

Looks like time now. Actual studies usually do, reporting (and, consequently, posted here) like comment replied to. report (# infected vaccinated)/(# infected) without sort normalization, people freak numbers highly vaccinated locales look bad. I‚Äôve even seen preprints it.

Honestly, I‚Äôm convinced good way interpret data now. vaccinated population skews heavily towards certain groups, vaccinated unvaccinated people tend comfortable different levels risk, vaccinated unvaccinated tend social circles relatively little overlap, vaccination rates vary heavily region. significant portion vaccinated still masking, distancing, minimizing unnecessary interactions unvaccinated largely whatever hell want, decide much reduction risk attribute preventative measure? far many variables unknown significance even begin control them. don‚Äôt know solution is, constant stream reports misinterpreting research papers statistics draw cynical conclusions possible harm good.

Looking reasons interesting.
The tldr risk profile using vaccines (iirc heart inflammation detected).
There also risk profile infected covid ofc.

In adults risk profiles means getting vaccinated clearly correct thing do.
But children immune response strong enough minimise risk covid.
So JCVI recommended kids get vaccinated (unless kid immucomprimised). hospitals starting triage based upon vaccination status. could well see doctors tell unvax patients go home die. no, safety stuff there's free alternative literally every adult american access literally everywhere

Also bet you‚Äôll see apply UE benefits. üòÜ    iirc, states require lost job fault qualify unemployment benefits, ie laid due downsizing covid whatever. wanted keep job company let go.

Getting fired something wrong lose job, obviously quitting voluntarily left, actions caused unemployed.

Your employer requiring covid vaccine continue working refusing choice get vaccinated caused lose job, ie actions, case inaction, caused get terminated.

Lost job, unemployment, least half decent jobs requiring vaccinated...I'm pretty sure we'll see sharp uptick vaccinations weeks people start able pay rent can't afford food family. I'm saying good put people type thing, humanity's survival stake here. sister camp. Took covid seriously took tons precautions, also afraid vax. soon got fda approval husband got vax. Republicans hasty non-thought-out decisions? would thought... Bravery one kindest ways name stupidity :) Trump never going back Washington unless it‚Äôs handcuffs subpoena. Funny getting downvoted exactly Biden Harris said. Guess people can‚Äôt believe idols would say thing. Chicago - Honolulu long flight. domestic flights intercontinental. Perhaps better exclusion length flight rather destination.

Dehydration also concern altitude. need beverage service. unfortunately needed happen. many Americans still willfully messing around jeopardizing efforts us mindful others.   recently realised America sometimes mask mandates, required wear N95 particular. Why?? Lots countries require N95 standard. think primary reason that's helping Fair point.

It could also stated forcing people inject anything extremely unethical immoral decision make.

What happens future mandated inject something legitimate concerns about?

Are concerns legitimate, knows. However, there's lot said persistent flip-flopping medical community politicians worldwide whole pandemic. example;

1) Two weeks flatten curve then,
2) need vaccinate 70% population herd immunity, then
3) need 100% vaccination stamp virus, then
4) Even 100% vaccinations immunity possible, still catch transmit virus, then,
5) may need weekly tests unknown amounts additional boosters, then,
6) virus mutated current vaccination provide immunity, need new vaccinations, then,
7) It'll 3 years, 10, good.

Totally fucking incoherent.

The problem think many incoherent conflicting statements politicians medical community sown seeds doubt many people. 

Turning fellow citizens lost faith intentions governments misplaced. governments medical communities held accountable extremely poor handling virus.

To make point, New Zealand messages directives government medical community always pretty consistent coherent beginning thus overwhelming support obedience population. Virtually everyone country followed advice success first class. 

I accept island state population 5 million puts us great advantage. However point still stands clear precise governance imperative pandemic, frankly, seen worldwide.

Go easy countrymen, hold politicians accountable.  effective masks? Got source this? Yep. guarantee create problems without solving any. can‚Äôt wait employers start charging employees tests. $20/week adds up. Exactly. Oh man cringe thinking Michigan last year. (Last year? - it‚Äôs blending together) bad Allergies definitely thing vaccines (I'm thinking egg allergies particular), know ones. Saw ingredient breakdown one mRNA vaccines really much there.

Otherwise... yeah maybe certain immunocompromised folks? too. One bigger problems case identified school entire classroom subjected testing, along parents siblings. take much one positive case prompt dozens dozens people need get tested, hope none also test positive. Thanks pointing out. thought Alberta 70% entire population, it‚Äôs 12+. think equivalent Denmark 85%, makes big difference. 

With regards higher case count, think it‚Äôs difficult compare Denmark‚Äôs testing capacity, far know, much higher Canada‚Äôs. testing peaked, testing around 15% entire population every day, think caught many asymptomatic cases otherwise might gone unnoticed. 

Thanks insight. I‚Äôm guessing major difference total amount fully vaccinated people we‚Äôll see go colder months.  probably lot scientists saying need take update, FDC approve it, one man tell take update.


Freedom comes meeting societies needs. believe believe anarchy something close it. Again, there's precedent this. authors paper linked actually say that:

""While COVID-19 learning interruptions unprecedented modern times, 
existing research impacts missing school (due absenteeism, regular summer breaks, 
and school closures) learning nonetheless inform projections potential learning loss 
due pandemic.""

These projections. wrote before, big pharma work, FDA draws hard bright line predictive biomarkers (ldl cholesterol, here, test scores) outcomes. really need outcomes data say anything. important hyperbolic overstate case, weighing educational outcomes *literal health nation world.* point unfair inaccurate talk outcomes; really talk predictions, estimates projections. 

And I'm frankly certain we're going see much difference versus placebo group posit near future, couple reasons. One zoom learning, also think ""placebo"" group going perform less well comparator 50s 80s environment expectations changed much. There's less homework, YouTube, less writing paper pen (shown improve retention typing multiple studies), computer games, etc. study correct, would submit numbers least Pfizer booster study shows 5-10 fold increase neutralization titers delta. dose two, 1 week 1 month number antibodies drop, however dose three, 1 week 1 month, numbers drop, increased least 1 month Pfizer trial initial - See Page 26 graph 

Since one effective treatments someone positive COVID monoclonal antibody treatment, would think could infer antibodies must beneficial immune response it.  hopefully limit amount quarantining healthy students. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article truly colored tired minority bots holding us hostage giving shit. really. it‚Äôs finally FDA Approved mandated. here. Whole team vaccinated months.   nursing student, agree, find anti-vax nurses shame profession. also agree science education nowhere near *should* be, people responsible administering medication life-saving treatment. switched path nursing majoring biology (which love passionate about) money flexibility 3 day workweek travel. Nursing masters STEM-dominated degree, nurse halfway finished program. deeply disappointed lack science, really going much depth metabolic mechanisms within Pharmacology, etc.. degree mostly test-taking, focused passing end exam (the NCLEX). really high-paying, high-flexibility, emotionally draining, glorified, science related trade school. said, respect nurses standing anti-vax.  rulings 9-0 8-1 Economic collapse. want many people get vaccinated possible way. First all, let‚Äôs start fact US postal service part mandate. Immediately, you‚Äôve brought entire idea health, safety ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù question made politics unions. 

Secondly, incentive structure wrong. country massive inequality large small businesses, high earners vs workers, you‚Äôre essentially empowering rich corporate overlords dangle unemployment potentially homelessness people‚Äôs heads don‚Äôt want vaccinated. always, sweeping regulation easily absorbed 1% companies cash hand available pay absorb consequences this. 

Here‚Äôs ‚Äúscience‚Äù actually says comes reducing hospitalizations Covid: vaccinate elderly first. don‚Äôt see achieve mandating workers, considering much elderly population isn‚Äôt work. move vulnerable, terminally ill, immunocompromised people underlying conditions. continue move age brackets enough people vaccinated curb issue hospitalization. 

I really don‚Äôt see going end well, even gets enforced all. government going enough companies refuse. enough workers refuse. refuse pay absurd fines? What‚Äôs course action, government going send storm troopers shut facilities? company extremely valuable surrounding community refuses? example, company distributes commodities local businesses consumption? (Fuel, food, etc.) know Biden good writing authoritarian laws empower police bust doors start firing weapons (cough‚Äîdrug laws‚Äîcough) shouldn‚Äôt surprise us he‚Äôs bottled this. Maybe? lot manufacturing companies South. I'm really sure though. International way better, also international flights require vaccination negative test.

They need similar domestic flights US well. Flying right. overlooked artists shine Armory Show, New York‚Äôs largest in-person fair since pandemic, shows across city.  So. Fucking. Cringe. pleasant angle take likely waiting full FDA approval. bin full carrots. carrots free. carrots free. stick 14k.    also historically recognize natural immunity. like every OECD nation, except us. haven‚Äôt yet, get third shot. Don‚Äôt wait instructions. can't confirm personally know logistics hospital strain. motive promise! paying search ""states offering covid vaccination incentives"" click ""news"" tab scroll through. There's way many keep copying pasting. many states tried variety incentives much changed. around awhile we're this. Lot people don‚Äôt possess critical thought capabilities! It‚Äôs vast majority exact! either trolling genuinely don‚Äôt understand critical information here. COVID never go away. ends massive strains hospital systems high daily death tallies go back normal. Question boosters. One specialist dr offices sent notice saying belong us go get booster 8 months. I‚Äôm coming 8 within weeks, go this? supposed waiting ‚Äúofficial‚Äù booster? schedule new appointment original pharmacy tell need booster? took Moderna figure even right booster stuff seems super confusing mixed messages news. ""Biden calls....."" -World Series Poker Announcer lot companies won‚Äôt enforce one enforce yet people fully vaccinated still need get tested computer glitch yet recorded vaccination record due ""high volumes"".  record told friend works government.  told get tested even getting 2nd Pfizer shot two weeks ago.  Seems really defeat purpose getting vaccinated, still told get tested cause ""not computer"".  Dumb! Oh dear god much time waste society stuff like Might want inform she'll likely qualify unemployment. usually get people reconsider. prepared whole generation long-covid sufferers. 

Tragic senseless human suffering could avoided. sympathize family 'doing research' crap pisses off. there's ppl dying around virus. research need do? think vaccine *sus?*  article says week video posted little week Blankenbiller died. elite seem trying kill loyal servant's system vsccine

not sure parse this? I'm big fan tbh. looking myocarditis 1/5000 risk teenage males (Israel), I'm disappointed they'd widely mandate without exploring options. J&amp;J, AZ, neither shown links myocarditis like mRNA vaccines have.

Especially US, health system means pay kidney every time need go hospital. compensation fund vaccine-related illness, seems quite complicated need go court (aka get lawyer) see money.

Then again, we're ones boldly said wear masks beginning pandemic - even makeshift ones - doctors could get more. That's country lol. true. Waiting programmed hate.  link wrong article hit hard well. less bed two days second shot. 

But, oh well? Better dying ventalator. kind forum people like need read. think ill two days bad, imagine slowly dying suffocating sometimes month, would be. Hah cool Facebook derrrffrf require vaccine. It‚Äôs easier less costly business don‚Äôt risk employees missing work due testing positive. dying excess rate? why? death rate haven‚Äôt high many years. nothing happening besides vaccine roll out. know speculations, correlation deffinately there‚Ä¶ Noone ever denied coverage. could see raising premiums offset bet everyone covered health insurance public healthcare. mean, they're worse actual virus.

I'm waiting covid test right now. I've vaccinated since January symptoms fairly mild. Still miserable, though. Keep mind Denmark high vaccination rates   Yeah, wtf? dude said healthcare basic human right got upvoted. I'm 100% vaccinations strongly dislike people refuse get them... wishing dead? Come reddit  Yes. I'm glad California. 

It hurts brain think places people (to mind) f'in crazy  ..tbh. He's going keep dying matter much complain.  Thanks. seems effective strategy.  deleted Facebook! mental health much better well. Yay  data find, I've looked lot, state evangelical protestant Christians always remain largest antivaxxer groups.  sure. half. that's lot disgusting see world. anyone know extent vaccines (average fine) cuts level transmission Delta compared amount exposure unvaccinated. Let‚Äôs second pretend isn‚Äôt disingenuous argument:
This less current situation. person, people country responsible Covid released upon world-certainly consequences. mind, criminal consequences‚Ä¶war crimes come mind. 
BUT, cannot address issue midst pandemic you? 
You compartmentalize issue, least get virus manageable level country conversation why. 
I mean, let‚Äôs hypothesize form attack weaken us. can‚Äôt even get citizens agree get page respond fight that. see many still getting sick dying high numbers arguing preventative measures-which event say, China example wanted weaken us, plays right hands. 
So it‚Äôs ludicrous ask would it. 
Thanks conservatives statistically‚Ä¶we‚Äôd argue, disagree give fort. ""You rue day!"" Bruh - doctors note tells HR medically unable get vaccine. medically unable get it, weekly tests pocket. sustainable us long term. Roe hasn‚Äôt fallen yet.

I‚Äôm much pro-vaccine, comparing two stupid. move Asheville you‚Äôll get things polar opposite political echo chamber. Exactly  I, too, tired minority holding us hostage. I‚Äôm done giving shit caring bots showing true colors.  really get narrative. Boosters vaccines nothing new. children's vaccination programme, several vaccines boosted set intervals. Teatnus vaccines boosted every ten years so, whooping cough vaccines. Hoping COVID vaccines would one-and-done nice thought, kinda contrary vaccines.  cowardly? seems opposite. wonder works remote employees. obviously people work 100+ employee company work home exclusively, mandated well? Based. Highly encourage watch local school board meetings. 

They filled people like this.

Happy smart people don‚Äôt go school board meetings protest mask mandates. think deserves death it.

I think OP saying *deserved* death, finite amount sympathy many going waste important tool protect *and others* instead chose use tool.

So many us family friends died *before vaccine even option.*. I'll save sympathy them.

As one final note, unvaccinated people much likely get sick much likely spread disease do. refusal get vaccinated might well end someone else's death, well. Slowly working well  I've heard mother lose child. sound could never faked never heard. It‚Äôs personal choice decision kill others. Enough people crying half assing. Let‚Äôs crush shit move on. Stop expecting free consequences. confirm. Already talked adamant antivax family member via text response meme chart expletives. 35-year-old immunized spring ‚Äî likely would get stronger immunity boost waiting longer another shot.

Are published studies showing benefit waiting 8 months booster vs 6 months countries adopting?  I\`m positive Trump/Biden's teams better negotiators Bolsonaro's, though.

IDK man, let know concrete info. U.S.?
I'm Canada guess different here.  think flight likely safe-ish, things equal. main risk airport terminals, building ventilation nearly good aircraft ventilation. Finally grownups back control  Numbers fake around here. put enough information prove anymore, even test vaccinated people covid symptoms, allowing nursing home workers tested positive return work 2 negative tests administered coworkers *wink wink* even clearly still symptoms. also start juking death numbers nursing homes every way possible (not testing, labeled recovered died later, fake job testing) economy school  area closing 90% vaccination, yet masks still mandatory lot places. Result get 20 deaths week average whereas we'd get 400 US policies ironic reality doctors instead upholding oath play dice game gets die today. like opposite signed for. managers instead life savers. Loosing patient trying deffo hits different playing beurocrat knowingly signing someone's death sentence. 

Life ridiculous sometimes.  said expected file regulatory dossier five 11 year olds September. also laid plans seek approval children aged 6 months 2 years later year.

Made feel lot less scared obesity (bmi 29-30 depending day) would affect covid survival chances, lol. must trolling also said it‚Äôs stay then. Welcome one labor friendly states US First comment found facebook feed: time dissolve union. Ok, conspiracy theories true point. Guess know comes next list  4D chess need leaders. Yeah Delta probably requires 90%. 85% plus natural infection gets 90. He‚Äôs mocking conspiracy theory vaccine going wipe us out.

 pointing would wiping members society obedient government would leave government deal segment population would hardest time controlling. 

Which obviously would really bizarre desire government have. Honestly majority Anti-vaxxers ones rush polls vote candidate ""owns libs"" anyway doubt it'll different.  That‚Äôs really parse means. you‚Äôre trying say can‚Äôt figure mean you‚Äôre either lying know damn well saying want gaslight thinking idea ridiculous you‚Äôre actually brain dead.

This coming someone doesn‚Äôt agree theory vaccine meant hurt people. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intended harmful, think likely safe people think thing it‚Äôs protecting isn‚Äôt dangerous people think.

I'm curious people's opinions it. comes previous vaccine mandates work places like medical, get tighter done missing immunization record show vaccinated naturally contracted. Measles example natural immunity measles show immunization record. get vaccine it. mandate going work similar? people who've contracted Delta variant less likely spread people vaccinated vaccines currently? Genuinely curious aspect, anyone thoughts/information it. traveled Aruba wear mask entire flight, tbh probably best flying experience I‚Äôve life simply apparently sleep mouth open flights face mask + sleep mask = blissful sleep. don‚Äôt sleep flights ever. also genuinely care people‚Äôs choices whether vaccinated not, really truly care decide it‚Äôs life, I‚Äôm it. Also actually prefer people food service wear masks preparing food too. That‚Äôs me. correctly interpreting weekly Covid test option employees facilities receive Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement?

Thankfully still makes case less severe. variants coming countries little vaccine access begin still come fully vax population.

Chances are, they‚Äôre refusing get vaccinated, they‚Äôre probably exactly joys work anyway. Delta significantly worse. know many people died Delta, original strain passed people missing work whatnot.  That's kind point think. really think 100% vaccination would get rid virus/pandemic? FDA report even acknowledges vaccine affect spread, rather aimed reduce side effects. Post card  We've seen people caught, caught mostly bragged social media someone reported stupid clear spelling errors fake vaccine cards.

That said - depends talking mask mandates. Im NY hardly one wearing masks anymore public - despite county cdc threshold. mandate general public - several private businesses required employees wear also public employees required.

Schools? dont expect go maskless rest year, least well school year. Obviously vaccines kids enough take overall case numbers down, could see lifted spring time maybe. quit. :) chickenpox vaccine came eligible age. given chickenpox vaccine already chickenpox.  think pressuring DeBlasio make change hybrid seems working fairly well? kind problem right? go large city one state COVID #'s high, vaccine rates mid whatever. go slightly smaller city another state COVID #'s lower, almost everyone vaxxed mask up. 

I agree hospitalizations appropriate metric, I'm hearing sort metric tied masks. IMO, problematic needs addressed. Got huge fight family said breath said would take ivermectin. Fucking morons. work grocery store 32 workers it, store work chain, well 100 people, osha mandate apply situation well? Sounds like nightmare workplaces keep got vaccine already. Everything‚Äôs fine besides right side body numb 3 months itch turned bloody rash, nah I‚Äôm jk I‚Äôm perfectly healthy. Fuck carrots waiting stick bit. Get fucking shot retartds. get vaccinated and/or wear mask. Life needs go forward.  would like point insane destructive Texas law banning abortion.

The government *no* say bodies. THR VIRUS MUTILATOR   none problem , care city's mask guidance based hospital admissions. wave subsides, stat fall. hits threshold mask recommendation goes away taking mine off. hospitalizations spike future put back on. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Felt pressured kinda regret it. constant headaches ever since took second dose months ago. vaccines new untested makes extremely nervous government going force people take shot know little about. Scary many people die sticking guns vaccinated? death work, unvaccinated 50. Died respiratory cardiac arrest  shunning shaming willingly unvaxxed get it. need move vaccines way whole.  Translation text graph showing UK cases rise slightly UK, reality declining several days England (over 80% UK residents) curve climbing rapidly Wales especially Scotland. # Covid19  Wear seatbelt drive right side road. last point spot on. people willing wear mask vaccinated, vice versa. exception kids eligible vaccine yet. public mask mandates stopping effective long time ago. never want hear another Democrat complain authoritarian Republican this. government literally saying kits citizens injection starvation.  think unfair intellectually handicapped people. Learning difficulties limitations usually lead people willfully deciding participate public health effort save lives. lead people decide help protect elderly immunocompromised. lead kind selfishness see running rampant anti-vaxx vaccine hesitant.

The intellectually handicapped malignant like that. matter vehemently vaccines, abuse power breach liberty. 

It's insane none politically brainwashed people (on left right) put aside bullshit actually realize what's infringed upon foundation country founded upon: LIBERTY.   anyone seen details exemptions federal vaccine mandate? think great idea, cousin works federal agency history allergic reactions vaccines. I'm sure exemptions available them, I've unable find details this.   Los Angeles 4 short weeks first mask mandate dropped June brought back July. People exhausted.

I go one HIIT gym doesn‚Äôt require masks. It‚Äôs pretty much class doesn‚Äôt every week it‚Äôs gotten packed. used doors open people would circuits outside, everything locked closed mask requirement. want go gym, guys.     [Eric Topol suggested count single prior infection seems less effective full mRNA vaccination, ""hybrid immunity"" conferred adding single mRNA booster dose seems effective. also avoids incentives deliberately get infected would still need shot, one fewer. Kinda want print put every door apartment complex. toddler mask every time step outside door, even going hall, unmasked neighbors look confused want take elevator them. Sometimes feels like ones give shit kids parents, lots times, even them. pray. Dont forget that. Prayer cure tight? /s Personally, think ""hospitals longer risk overstressed"" appropriate metric. different jurisdictions going different things. US states wide open, restrictions, mandates even worst Delta. places put outdoor mask mandates. affect answer. We‚Äôre getting $150. One directs hadn‚Äôt gotten it, said $150 changed mind. bar low.

Also ended getting Covid 2 days appointment. super. doesn‚Äôt need to. Delta breakthroughs happening replicates much faster immune system hard time keeping first.  is. either follow carrot dangling stick eventually either eat least keep following it. not...you get beaten stick carrot dangling person holding wanted.   Basically boils experience problems without knowledge understand them.

Nurses ones dealing worst part health care also first hand knowledge things go bad. made easy fall anecdotal fallacy need deal something couple times think normal, point statistic prove change mind something ""saw themselves"".

Then side doctors, virtually 100% pro-vaccine, anti-vaxxers rare. need draw important line health care workers

Nurses need know ""how it"", dont need know ""why/how works"". Doctors need knowledges lack knowledge something works bring nurses ignorant side

ps: want add nurses important, know doctors, problem think know without really said knowledge outside pratical side Aww shit yea Im Aussie, taught school acknowledge shit did.   Yes, that's referring (protection reinfection). I'm curious statement ""vaccine gives greater protection simply contracting virus"" I've seen arguments sides vs instance), let's assume second accept CDC's statement \[vaccine offers \~2 times better protection\]. point say, ""hey need get booster/vax""? objective measure antibody level (maybe certain threshold)? Otherwise, becomes shouting match higher protection rather what's sufficient level protection. 


Fair point exemptions, though doubts long hold. things improve, see overthrowing forcing all. mean, they've taken step, what's prevent taking another? 


Also, mentioned first comment, I'm mask-mandates. reason is, look people unvaxxed, generally 2 groups: anti-vax (in case mandate unlikely change anything vax status, less resistant masking compared vax) vax-hesitant taking necessary precautious problem wearing masks. what's overall outcome mandate? **You're going vax portion people fence would've gotten anyway given time honest conversations, also going turn-off people.** all, mask mandates employers sizes likely receive much less opposition, even strong opposition, least serve benchmark much resistance vax-mandates. conservative approach offers benefits tried vax-mandate opinion. Can‚Äôt tell serious (and misinformed) sarcastic. vaccine, yes. Delta far virulent original strain. Breakthrough cases thing, data suggests boosters needed. fully vaccinated March. thus understand concerns. High vaccination rates part us learning live it. often wonder many anti-vaxxer alive vaccines. 180 million vaccinated people US, rate breakthroughs somewhere 1 5,000 1 10,000. many people that's 18,000-36,000 cases even vaccine. even rare, lot people. Meanwhile rate cases unvaccinated 10 times high.

So area 75% vaccinated x cases among vaccinated 3-4x among unvaccinated. They've saying thing UK past week know what? Cases havent gone all. hope stays way, way lockdowns thing anymore (see USA proof allowed spread) ita worrying could end things start go wrong. 10% stupid give fuck about....... installing mandate target specific 10%? problem 10% enough big proportion destabilize society. strategy....   would think, you‚Äôll usually get downvoted mentioning it.

We need way mask mandates. Vaccinated people need lives back fully. mention‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs often places best numbers wise actually them, they‚Äôre much anymore. agree remember - terrible. Glad vaccine.  come point spite Biden current government. paper article flawed retrospective study prove anything natural immunity. Probably getting downvoted. Lower dosage vaccine. Omg live Georgia mouth breathers bible thumping super spreaders  wrong friend - dude uses implanted freestyle blood sugar monitor uses smart phone check share doctor smh.  Uh oh Reddit police officer.  Yes  Cupcake cakes definitely thing. article says global, hopefully means US, UK, EU, etc.  went college 8 years ago. meningitis, mumps, measles, Hep A, rubella.

Wasn‚Äôt big deal all, already date most. fake rage government overreach vaccines entirely manufactured Fox News.  Interesting know, thanks!

I honestly trying get habit delta variant causing fuss even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. think asking doctors office details would good idea‚Äîthey know medical history anyone here. fair, could hurried results larger initial sample size, event rate (in case infection rate) previously high, divergence study arms happened relatively quickly (assuming study design allows interim analysis require fixed end point)... course certain minimum duration terms time get shots build immunity, larger sample sizes (and/or higher incidence illness), combined efficacious vaccine, show statistical significance rapidly.

For better worse incidence dropped number study locations may slowed potential interim analysis could lead EUA.


Mind fully acknowledge know specific trial design said true trials may actually apply... maybe said anything üòÖ know though? pretty dumb. they're difficult ground want air. get people plane. I've kicked people plane month entire career prior(5 years).  It‚Äôs really hard pin down, Monica Gandhi UCSF really good Twitter thread number studies come recently: short version seem cut substantially transmission reducing risk infection eliciting fairly rapid immune response shuts virus transmissibility get infected. you‚Äôre asymptomatic risk transmitting may minimal, still unclear through. cities requiring masks indoors vaccinated. Stepping right thing face uncertainty opposition. real hero.  even one positive case area. They're quarantining entire classes one child one symptom, including headache. I'm common sense mitigation (masks, outdoor lunch, etc.), new policy extreme. wouldn‚Äôt count faster, unless Federal Government intervenes makes fast track (the FDA extremely unhappy full approval). I'm saying ok guess. Humanity far worse diseases covid far less means combat it‚Ä¶will get too. need overly dramatic. positive note. sharp decline people worms Australia. hermit excuse fly anymore me. time increase possibility spreading somebody else. Get vaccinated.  get vaccine, they're level protection. Americans vacation Europe anyway moment? need QR covid certificate basically anything. foreign vaccinated visitors obtain arrival? ""Most"" misstatement. friends apparently unlucky sample true among people know. We're 20s could why. vaccine that's given systemic reaction certainly felt abnormal me. 

[12% trouble working next day dose 65+ report systemic reaction vs. 82% 18-64. 10% 65+ reported fever vs. 17% incorrect, still significant number. regret saying I'm glad OSHA order provides sick leave this. places allow 4 unmasked. Many limit ‚Äúover 6‚Äù. Maybe help explain lower numbers 5-11?   pregnant people still can‚Äôt get vaccinated up

Actually today officially recommended it: ‚¨ÜÔ∏èspread = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èmutation = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èvaccine resistance = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èhospitalization &amp; deaths Ive got shot, rhetoric people without shot deserve die absolutely disgusting. excuse witch hunt people one group, everyone, us - vaccinated unvaccinated. looking people crucify vile. Covid stay, we've got accept unless come actual vaccine. we've got COVID shots - like annual flu shots. Calling vaccines dangerous statement. confusing people.

Sure, we've got people right thing 6-8 months ago. Theyve got card. part. BUT, vulnerable again, spread, arent going them, talking all.

Edit: Also, IMMEDIATE assumption Im vaccinated huge part problem. jumping extremist conclusions put people camp different opinion you. Wow. look reported major media outlets already. attacked personally tried dig shit ? standard American way admitting lost argument? It‚Äôs lazy find testing site near live, yes. It‚Äôs easy get tested. Stop lazy.  almost like give shit  Literally Ireland right vacation, there's still people queueing vaccinations Dublin üôÇ must nice living country people try haha case Israel‚Ä¶ plane full infected assholes faked negative test results. bought fake test results Ukraine. accurate venn diagram accurate. fall procedure normally occurs. 1) employee complains OSHA, 2) OSHA representative screens complaint, 3) OSHA calls business talk policies, 4) OSHA formally demands records OSHA 300, vaccination exemptions, weekly test logs, employee counts, etc. 5) employers around 72 hours submit electronic records review 6) employers either compliance given penalty non-compliance.

The easiest way think cops cracking drunk driving. number police stayed same, efforts priorities shifted. 

With method, single OSHA inspector handle dozens cases simultaneously without ever set foot facility Mandatory vaccination applies Federal employees contractors.

Just like private company, government right mandate employees enter facilities. understand ADA. workplace make [REASONABLE **Accommodations considered ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù create undue hardship direct threat.**

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   didn‚Äôt agree anything ok. You‚Äôre kinda delusional side. idea vaccine personal choice wrong

What else would like mandate life? still eat mcdonalds? quit drinking? Must forced exercise 3 times week? draw line...? worked paramedic nurse ICU ER, know screaming.

I kidney stone,

I perforated large bowel screamed like little girl.

The screaming video screaming someone death visit family/loved one.  experience actually abusive situation? TwoX representative reality write like that's knowledge comes from. Living truly abusive household far different. support system stop father mother beating shit kids. Leaving situation thing does. Work provides distraction. Support systems great, I'm knocking all, BTW. working home making abusive situation worse. Staying does. support system change that.

As far second paragraph, point older people complain they've accepted it. get older, friends move on, get married, live life, move, etc. work maybe family. happens whether covid not. bemoaning losing ability go party friends, feel sorry all. I'm going sacrifice hours life, health, happiness commute soulless office privileged decade partying 20s. Must nice something minor worst thing complain about. Yeah states make illegal employers require direct deposit. annoying administratively companies. rebuttals keep seeing exact sentiment along lines ""I've local hospital completely empty. LyInG bAd Is!!!111"" single data point proves fine everywhere (not mention find likely lying even local hospital.)

It's crazy much willing ignorance we've seen course this, think largely people turned political and/or ideological rather simply looking facts. Nevermind fact freaking virus sure shit checking see people register vote infects them.  True. Sure, completely foolproof nothing really is. look way look large events restaurants it. big enough deterrent vast majority people going take risk getting busted. might sneak that's probably similar amount vaccinated people might asymptomatic breakthrough case. There's always going risk.  That's hope well! think OP‚Äô point antivaxers aren‚Äôt exactly type travels. Exactly. Getting vaccinated easy picking OTC medicine nowadays. Judging videos also think it‚Äôs fair say could gotten even earlier judging weight well. incredibly small chance catching covid plane due way air circulated/filtered (less 1 4,000 last time checked, vaccines even came out) Why? 

Should permanent lockdown till cases reach zero? Aaaw, check post history ? I'm flattered. Thanks agreeing me. Mhm sure would.    wanted say good luck! next time meet enemies front lines mandate leads Civil War type scenario.  bunch Republican governors announced either disobey Biden‚Äôs vaccine mandate OSHA sue. go wrong country? Grown men/women making threats Twitter prolonging pandemic for‚Ä¶a brownie points base? Resisting safe effective vaccine? One thing certain, issue solved long term. really think bad.

It's bad. not. wife did. quoted believe life forever. think life years. Mainly misinformation politics push back. government mandates slowly ramping private companies getting fed making mandates well. slow grind friend. 

I believe take masks eventually lifetime now. Yeah. mostly old companies/industries upgraded parts structure. Hospitals, lawyers, government sectors main ones.

Hell, even use fax, snail mail.  well should. need COVID? Agreed! see many people discussing thread.
I feel bad people (yes unfortunately one) cannot get vaxxed desperately want to. want everyone ""ma freedoms"" people understand liberty ends nose. You‚Äôre golden Reddit knight aren‚Äôt you. Go try sue people. 

Didn‚Äôt state wether get it. simple fact it. they! freedom, tyranny must resisted! Great hear! Sorry wrong, cases gone 30% two months restrictions. COVID over, employers mandate exercises every able bodied person

If going put sin tax booze smokes, better put one fast food! even better! mean mandating things peoples good seems cool new thing.

We start taking kids parents too, case might teach something counter federal control narrative, like individual liberty actually exists.  good. wish would approve vaccines kids 12 could stop worrying little bit. :(   people mad never going vote Democratic anyway, bunch probably passed away then. Among survivors, longhaulers might even able vote States putting restrictions mail-in ballots early voting. confirm major surgeries done age 11 say age 21 I‚Äôm definitely traumatized absolutely avoid hospital much now. Man doctors Medicaid great. Guess depends live? Wow, Ireland!  park car hill, set emergency brake, curb wheels still somehow manages roll hill kill someone, going criminally liable took necessary precautions prevent person dying.

If park hill, set brake, curb wheels significant chance car roll hill potentially kill someone, could held liable take necessary precautions.

This mandates say must take necessary precautions parking hill. There's millions mandates cover kinds topics across world pretty much every country place protect lives others. ones probably familiar food service regulate handling food, mishandling food kill people.

This first time U.S. mandated vaccines, challenged several times found perfectly Constitutional government right responsibility protect citizens citizens choose take necessary precautions.

Setting mandate protects lives others make someone dictator.   true. likely flew close sun fortunately manageable and‚Äî fingers crossed‚Äî makes far less likely contract again.  Since beginning pandemic, I've able read many articles posted archived link. greatly appreciated. believe hundreds people already caught trying cross Canadian border fake cards/passports. story couple weeks ago US couple caught fined $20,000. top US gov't might take legal action too. see knuckleheads got arrested Hawaii presenting fake vaccine cards? 

It might worked them, presented fake vaccination card 4 year old child. Duh! even reported, I'll take though. might want make nuanced arguments instead spouting standard antivax rhetoric, way people treat like idiot. No. 

OSHA stating work employer 100 more, need vaccinated subject routine testing keep others safe. That's workplace safety. prevents people dying due something caused workplace.

Being obese kill others. kills you. better analogy impaired driving. ban kills you. ban kills others. I've got 8 year old respiratory issues first line this. excited! 9/9, 61.1% Israelis fully vaccinated. highest rate, nations. US, 54%.  Israel first data decline vaccination efficacy established seeing early evidence there, impact booster shots. Wtg Ireland  Grocery stores never significant source transmission. nothing fear another vaccinated person, especially masked. logic is: mandate won‚Äôt reduce number people hospitals nobody follow it. making people follow bad. therefore less hospitalizations=bad. OSHA regulations favor employees OK, this)

Because abuse OSHA push greater executive control bypass legislative process. hope won‚Äôt need couple weeks approve it. all, vaccine that‚Äôs administered literally billion times already virtually severe complications. purely going exercise assuring it‚Äôs safe lowered dosage young immune system side effects observed older children adults. knee jerk reaction blame family? Certainly could reduced risk, assign blame child siblings could gotten COVID number sources, asinine. 

What difference would made mother vaxxed siblings contracted school? ZERO. likelihood hypothetical situation actually occured? would assume pretty damn high.

This purely failure personal responsibility. colossal societal failure, one own.

Who plans budgets healthy children die? one bury child. Demonizing family nothing honor little girl's passing. study since shown methodologically unsound best completely fraudulent worst. problem people trust scientific authority all, authority comes along debunks flawed research emboldens anti-vaxxers even more. ""They want use know truth they're bed big pharma, they're trying shut down.""

Same reason idiots still believe childhood vaccines cause autism. two cents anyway. wayyyy past days 1st Amendment shit, put us trouble. Fuck it, need put safety ahead archaic piece feed trolls. Probably right term. remember technical term studying drug vs. virus isolation (i.e. outside human body) lazy re-read article :-/  ‚ÄúForcing anyone something fucked up‚Äù

So police, laws, military chain command?  disagree. It‚Äôs clear can‚Äôt stop covid giving people currently existing treatments (Israel clear data this, Iceland recently 90%+ vax rate undergoing outbreak time there).

The false idea stop treatments excused extremely toxic culture wishing death comply take treatment. So, false premise become reasons usher totalizing government force (because true stop ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù, force everyone?)  Venn diagram anti-vaxxers people unironically used ""freedom fries"" circle. think care much. issues, thus less places get tested, suddenly everyone forced get tested.... see. little thinking goes long way.  longer parental leave. free healthcare. free college.

But taxes would likely stay Andy pocket would go down? Get socialism paycheck! /s Would mind too? general overview quotes many professionals dealing directly facilities control.

‚ÄúThe study measured mortality rate 8,500 veterans 88 VA hospitals March November.

As ICU demand increased, mortality rate went ‚Äî trend consistent different times pandemic.

The study delve people died ICU busiest, Rubinson says association ‚Äî least ‚Äî warning letting hospitals get overloaded perilous.‚Äù

This one little connection overcrowding care course! Since masks fix everything, maybe lieu bullet proof vests, issue masks. /s

Masks small part equation. Social distancing much better deterrent, something Texas allowing schools. ""chances slim none catch Covid flight"". think lot peddled airline industry. Maybe air filtered well inside planes, breathe air. someone sneezes next single layer bandana, good luck. Also, boarding crowded process indoor space poor ventilation. 

Requiring negative tests vaccination would help reduce spread huge inconvenience.  doesn‚Äôt track? Covid cases area bunch testing locations plenty appt‚Äôs available. It‚Äôs complicated, areas high Covid areas testing sites currently getting slammed. people keep word? CDC/White House guidance probably need Congrats overtime payout. hospitals run them, care rationed... effecting others know 11 million people desperately need job?

‚ÄúPlenty healthcare workers don‚Äôt want it‚Äù

Its little disturbing concerning healthcare workers don‚Äôt want vaccine deadly pandemic.

If healthcare workers want lose job instead protecting deadly virus, loss? Yeah, god forbid proven work rather Cletus said FB live video. Enjoy self-selecting leper colony think waiting period fully approve don‚Äôt think much longer.

I could definitely see parents suing block it‚Äôs technically approved yet. hate icing, I've noticed every time sister makes cupcakes, turns big cupcake cake smashes shit onto giant plate lol. Real political progress happens bakery! Lmao you‚Äôre truly idiot. It‚Äôs politicians, it‚Äôs actions people.  doesnt track ok. Im done, yall can't reasoned anyway. someone frequently uses public transport think it‚Äôs impossible enforce screening people urban areas without severely disrupting service. thank you! don‚Äôt want socialism job. work 40-60 hours week next 50 years take 5 days year most, that‚Äôs American way! /s SB8 Biden mandating vaccination completely two different events. 

SB8 Texas attempt bypass already standing constitutional law lets women get legal abortion giving power enforcement civilian giving freedom sue anyone please get paid reward. directly bypass constitution 

Biden vaccine mandate unprecedented. Numerous presidents past used power executive office force private companies compliance. Lyndon B Johnson signed Medicade act law, forced southern hospitals admit black patients risk getting funding. Lincoln mandated polio vaccine soldiers.

As see 600,000 people dying virus keep mutating. evident can't let remaining 1/4 America go unvaccinated. Hospitals crowded point national guard step relieve worn staff. may see vaccine mandate reach government technically is. time entire point government serve protect citizen's foreign domestic threats. 

If really want see pandemic come end least get control, need people vaccinated  Good thing they‚Äôre loosening social restrictions. hope every fiber being, can't anymore lol. Trying stay positive hope still fall activities planned summer numbers lower. Pretty soon adults fam vaxxed and/or prior infection waiting approval 12. can't wait things without worrying! Nope, started pushing kit last year included Ivermectin along Hydroxychloroquine. must butt load money invested pharmaceutical companies stock something everyone calling bull crap kit past year. Ah, took care Native Americans.  test.    time trial pool basically 5-11 whose parents want jab kids, basically backdoor EUA it, Personal Protective Equipment? aware OSHA's authority regulate *companies*, workplace safety, actual employees? That's employer gets fined violations worker Cool, Covid isn‚Äôt issue live testing sites plenty openings people like get tested every week üëçüèª Crazy sounds, there's actually way avoid losing jobs. extremists sides Covid spectrum, criticise certain aspects Covid handled governments, people label anti-vaxxer despite repeatedly mentioned vaccinated.

People want facts, want angry - they've spent year cooped indoors clearly hugely detrimental impact social skills.  trying buy enough test weekly due exposure work, hard. I've finally got packs closet took effort. mandate masks planes, mandate negative tests vaccinations. agree child's death tragedy? agree singular variable led death?

I swear I'm talking 2 different unmoving sides. antivax morons one side, ""blame everything antivax morons"" morons side. CANNOT SAY ""OUR RESPONSIBILITY"" WITHOUT ALSO SAYING ""OUR FAULT.""

I'm frontline HCP. I've watched people die past 18 months entire career. I'm vaxxed pre-vax alpha survivor. I've family members die this.

I get it. Personal responsibility important. cannot say everything could. put idiots power. allowed disinformation campaigns. tolerant unvaxxed friends family members got bad again.

Regardless parents' actions, young girl DIED failings. failings includes parents. brownie points base

The public anti-vax/pandemic denial sentiment happen vacuum. tweets strategic calculated. Ultimately, everything politicians ensure either party stays power. Surely, political advisory teams understand sentiment smallish, vocal minority likely end alienating lot moderate voters. get it. Different residential. That‚Äôs local building code European calm inform much better America Europe. Customer service, bureaucracy, hygiene, shopping nature much better America Europe. That's California. Super convenient.  Sinovac 2 shot vaccine getting vaccine expense others others vaccinated!? person suffers consequences actions person that's vaccinated   vaccinated coronavirus March Johnson Johnson, based CDC/White House guidance probably need booster couple weeks. hope get Pfizer booster FDA approved safe ""mix"" brands.

However, university massive outbreak flu spreading rapidly plan getting flu shot.

My mom believe flu shot despite getting covid one. worried getting both. Personally, think stupid. confirm, safety concerns getting flu covid shot window time(2-4 weeks)? It‚Äôs pretty incredible, right?! home Canada went thing Ontario sub: people absolutely convinced spree unvaccinated Americans headed infect suburbs Toronto fake vaccine cards. 

As turns out, false documentation they‚Äôve caught boarder‚Äî least made news‚Äî hands two Canadians. okay lol reddit mess lately. took away safe spaces debate people educated echo chamber gotchas power leaves ability downvote project though ever really that? Hawaii, places required log hawaii safe travels account show quarantine exemption valid. However quarantine exemption based uploading picture vaccination card idea validate vaccination card. exemptions one religion specifically forbids vaccines fyi, it‚Äôs religions forbid abortion thus sort medical research/innovation using stem cells. don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs case though? Idk what‚Äôs spineless ok sacrificing neighbor narrative politician gave you, happens ignore complex issue open debate  way see it, assumption everything work akin free rider problem labor representation. entitled society know certain quantity act bad faith, provided enough population act good faith. 

This seen herd immunity politics currently high issue salience, also found tax avoidance, insurance, pollution. 

Just know, us like that. Many us, perhaps like starting realize order die slow deaths depression need unite solve problems left us. Ironic so-called ""free thinkers"" free *of* thinking. Well that's mega 8 booster vaxxed assholes find late. banned one go anywhere. watching stupidity understanding asking exchange ""muh back normal"" horrific.  think it‚Äôs they‚Äôre trying use divide conquer strategy every topic try gain power. think it‚Äôs self destructive, especially COVID policy. followed those, here, sucks suck, anti-maskers. 3rd shot cumulative total completely flatlined, they're barely 3rd doses more.

This really true. thing happened Israel period major holidays (half week Jewish new year), relatively people get vaccinated holidays/weekend. Yesterday however 73k people received 3rd shot. Sounds like time FDA make Pfizer restart trial make increase number participants trial second time.  Denmark extremely evangelical protestants, fairly typical northern Europe. Denmark quite consistently comes near bottom surveys people believe God. may seem strange since majority members Church Denmark (which case softest version Christianity found anywhere), see cultural thing, rarely ever attending service, generally believe God.

However, groups far lowest vaccine rates highest covid rates consistently places many people North African Middle Eastern origin, I'm convinced related religion. Local Muslim organizations Mosques publicly supported vaccines. multi-language guide vaccines Danish health authorities made -and supported by- Danish Islamic Center, Danish-Turkish Islamic Foundation, Islamic Union Denmark, Danish-Moroccan Forum, Muslim Joint Council, Danish Muslim Union Minhaj-ul-Quran Denmark. However, still hard reach people originate countries, despite also providing vaccinations home/work/education getting help people local communities. Apparently, one main problems often rely heavily certain news sources countries origin. really conspiracy theories, especially vaccine causes infertility. are. 2.5 million RNs US, 2.1 million women. Less 400,000 men. ""Think menz!"" forget caping like keeps happening?  No, self-righteous individual. compassion give former friend benefit doubt. can't live way. easy necessary. track who‚Äôs taken ivermectin everyone isn‚Äôt racing jockey pharmacy? saw people TikTok posting like candy...its wonder went stock.

(For example, video posted bunch unmasked rich kids partying took photo stack tests tagged ""Game night"") wait till one outside vaxxed one blame need 19th booster keep up. Yeah show them!! Back normal!! course, get anymore, find something else believe in.  old SCOTUS precedent turn century Massachusetts makes even draconian mandates legal, least barring new ruling SCOTUS. mean SCOTUS would make judgement today, ruling predates lot modern views bodily autonomy, present, even blanket mandate entire population fines enforcement would legal.  Thats great, that's case. JFC, many unnecessary deaths be? 

&amp;#x200B;

This 4 year old girl die; parents failed her. also MANY govt jobs don‚Äôt mandate it, sometimes work office w lot ppl maybe, many places take word it. Thanks. don‚Äôt mind. sometimes takes minutes process article. black white. COVID ever going away, strain healthcare systems case surges definitely decline--likely surge done. Heck, US everything back normal already anyway. ask personal pandemic endgame is. Isn‚Äôt Bolsonaro‚Äôs shtick new treatment made Amazonian spider venom something? Wait invaded took country? means politicians, agree Yeah fully approved need full-full approval basically phase 4 study occurs full approval study long term effects lasts year. Nah dude, winding down. UK's numbers reveal: there's widespread immunity, either vaccination previous infection, case counts longer increase hospitalizations/deaths significant rate, point pandemic effectively over. We're already seeing happen states US. We're end stages speak. people dont pay child support  Yeah good news around vaccinated adults wearing masks helps lot protect children.

I‚Äôm hoping vaccine approval too. fuck happened made spineless? Please stay least 3 baguettes away. ever explain it? would vastly prefer congress job instead. ""EUA"" think OP means ""Emergency Use Authorization"" opposed ""full FDA approval."" US, EUA used start vaccination push December 2020 full approval given US FDA weeks ago.   Bro everyone hope successful, would show end.  Guarantee Tucker vaccinated. Fox News requires it.  Wait, I'm sorry. 

It's got emergency approval ages 12-15, substantial risk cardiovascular issues 25. 

How allowed? 

What happens get it? denied school? attend online school? asking immunization papers along birth certificates, immunization papers? kidding. 10 mandatory vaccines, one ever complained. one actually matters, somehow half force issue post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Fuck need flu shot theres lines every drugstore people stopped trusting intellectuals live information age, think watching one YouTube video reading Facebook comment made intellectual topic. antivaxxers people ""don't know"". they're adamant know every single scientific expert recommends getting vaccinated. 

also, need communication? think we've past 9 months? communication time over. beyond ridiculous anyone vaccinated yet. Unbelievable. thought guys like high-tech stuff... Good, best way protect children vaccinate adults around them. state maintains records also providers gave shots. electronically get records state Rite-Aid (who providing QR).

 problem that's 50 states knows kind tracking software. always centralized wasn't.  Context important. 
Your reply may seem silly isn‚Äôt silly takes important point removing context creates misinformation. fuck happened us people saying shit like Weirdly, quitting automatically mean get unemployment, mean 80% cases. mandate take effect, too? awaiting instructions that, POTUS give details speech? ‚ÄúGrowing kitchen table learned‚Äù‚Äî joe  Im pretty concerned girlfriend. able get first shot got Vaccine induced Thrombocythemia platelets fell critical, near bleed death spontaneously levels. going lose job this?

THANK YOU!

NC million dollar lotteries anyone vaccinated. least backdated anyone shot eligible. 

I manager back May company ""return office fired"" policy. put ass line told team could ""work home"" day two following shot. Interestingly anyone making policies company always worked home pretty easy leeway.  course shake heads both, real cure good old fashion bleach injection. Ooooh look mr. fully vaccinated big time qualifications basic summary since listened podcast couple times.

In view, third shot boost antibodies broad cell immunity response. far, third shot seems safe well.  thinks timing doses make big difference.

However, argument third shot 1) enough data reducing efficacy severe disease 2) global equity concern even though that's logistic issue rather simply giving US vaccines Africa.

They also talked data Israel regarding big drop efficacy severe disease/hospitalization. understand case may takes sort Israel's data out.

For people keep scoreboard, Dr. Shane Crotty lean toward booster Dr. Vincent Racaniello booster. sure. I'm expert poverty homelessness. I'm guy telling they'll ""find out"" refuse. happened HDQ? Cool perfectly normal like everyone else  worked work twice Ha, guys lucky. nothing least 90 cases school 800‚Ä¶ There's reason everyone vaccinated though. natural immunity provides protection mean also get vaccinated.  dare government try save lives reduce deaths. stupid good. Go Ireland!  India gave whole population surge claimed helped, don‚Äôt think much study action. pay school taxes check. even checkbook. (I mean find one desk drawer. First time used like decade.) goes affect companies enforce it. 

Some companies run rules asap - likely wanted already didnt want bad guy - blame feds shrug.

Other companies might never enforce tie lawsuits courts years till really matter anymore Fingers crossed. friend returned honeymoon without problem QR code within days trip‚Ä¶ could luck. 

They make include return date travel tickets within form suspect would move people didn‚Äôt get time, instead processing health pass reason. it‚Äôs government though, maybe not. Well, they'll complain even harder victims genocide. Natural immunity better nothing, reason actually get vaccinated. There's good reason get vaccine. unvaccinated minorities?  WH want confirm since part strategy try get people go ahead get vaccinated. 

It's really mandate traditional sense president signing executive order starting next day. WSJ reporting emergency order OSHA go permanent OSHA rule. takes time make emergency order, give public notice, give businesses notice, build reporting mechanism, etc. also going challenged courts (which may may hold OSHA emergency order). ate one them?! supposed 2 Baguettes?   I'm sure makes parents 'few' dead children feel *soooooo* much better...

/s Lawsuits thrown immediately. See: Jacobson v. Massachusetts that, PCR testing turnaround free places 3-4 days (last checked month ago -- could better worse now). would want leave GREATEST COUNTRY WORLD‚Ñ¢ anyways? Same, work really well think. tested kids came home school sick. tested full fledged symptoms negative. ended two day cold back normal. 

Really convenient. Vaccines existed long time, tested, vetted long term issues, on. Covid new, yet known long term effects. Thats difference.     I'm unvaccinated american france shit hope kick lmao Firstly, data say vaccinated ending hospital higher rate, that's misreading. 80% vaccinated comparing like like. 80% people, similar numbers total 20% people. evidence efficacy. made clear, still useful comparison since confounded age. Older people Israel likely vaccinated therefore likely hospital. difficult biostats.

But right, absolute terms prove vaccine 100% goi g prevent serious illness. work 300 odd here!

It around 90% Pfizer prior delta variant. Latest studies show 66% delta.

So yes. great still best defence. Boosters gunna needed probably, least 60s don‚Äôt think countless healthcare workers looking job raise?

If exhausted Covid wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated? Wow, message parents saying kids. must suck learn parents give little fuck life. :( ones hiring people ones people wanting do, trained for. going alleviate numbers, make worse. 

Hell burger King Town paying ""up to"" $14 hour even advertising next day pay, still understaffed. Thanks guys. couldn‚Äôt open link helpful. thing many people trust media experts who're proclaiming vaccine safe effective. work government, trumpets losing mind, looks like may openings soon, get rid dead wood they‚Äôll boycott France?? Tee hee. reference hospitalization rate flu age group 2018-2019 127.9 per 100k  One job 2018 still used manual time clock actual punch cards. offered choice either paper check mailed house receive pay pre-loaded debit card. literally could get direct deposit. left week. said shouldn‚Äôt blame family young vaxed. family anti vax (and anti masks info seeing) would wearing mask probably wouldn‚Äôt gotten it. Texas way Texas people live there. ban mask mandates doesn‚Äôt mean families take covid seriously can‚Äôt children wear masks. preventative measures important. family members unvaccinated 100% blame children get sick. previous comment mentioned UK. UK deaths per day rising. US. 

The one bright spot active cases leveled UK. Yes clarified bit. meant saying free government shouldering costs. Thanks Tucker Carlson transcript. stand corrected. long governors banning mask mandates, feels pointless even think lockdowns. Meanwhile America bans vaccinated unvaccinated French people. Well, yeah. covid issue area forced vaccinated possibly cause complications due it?  totally get saying call keeping bubble. avoid higher crime rate areas city, etc? could also classified keeping bubble. Unless meant, can't literally keep bubble like bubble boy? case yeah it'd easier could lol. Every time go anywhere wear masks even though wife fully vaccinated still anxiety out. That‚Äôs timeline implement mandate? so, that‚Äôs crazy! Also I‚Äôd curious that‚Äôs confirmed WH. public schools require vaccines.   People jumping gun this. going take rolled likely contested court. Typical, it‚Äôs happening doesn‚Äôt count. fair them, vaccines mandated approved FDA use kids. still EUA, point contention, requirement vaccine general (at least - insane). know could COVID-18.5 rounded portion eligible population vaccinated relevance virus. distinguish. 

Alberta's 66% higher US average, far Canadian average. many fewer Canada infected could easily less overall immunity. mean applies Alabama uses it. means may reallocating expanding 49 states he's also responsible for.

It's also ""free"" sense Federal government paying private insurance cover, actually pretty damn expensive government  topic, LOVE user name! apparently vaccinated people? delta transmissible vaxxed people. you‚Äôre talking hospital beds, that‚Äôs different story.. We‚Äôve gone full circle again‚Ä¶

And eating sugar smoking, we‚Äôre forcing people eat healthy quit smoking order lose jobs. 

Stop forcing people take vaccine hasn‚Äôt even year.  wont it?

Someone leaves job vaccines another person takes it.  Nothing live, problem here. Thats issue. know someone went France US within last month. expect get vaccine QR code anytime soon. backlogged several weeks, more. person already completed visit France gone another country request France get QR code US vaccine card (which filed trip) still processed.

You likely need take covid test every 72 hours. Showing negative covid test &lt;72 hours old get places pass showing vaccinated.

A different person (that know less details about) traveling around EU (Italy Germany believe) showing paper vaccine card. Apparently majority places accepted it, though sometimes front line workers know call manager. vaccine works lot variants, delta included. Zzzzzzz Scott Gottlieb basically said 6 12 months CNBC interview morning. got ways go.  Gosh, almost like many population refuses mask up, socially distance, get vaccinated bad everyone, something!

This chess checkers. conservative fever dream that: dream. travel far away Texas Florida Norway recommending one shot teens; myocarditis mainly observed within days 2nd shot.   anyone seen date mandate employers 100+ workers go effect?

With many mandates, seem getting delayed. NYS pushed back ‚Äúget vaccinated tested‚Äù deadline health care workers month. I‚Äôm thinking time mandates go place, delta already peaked impact severe COVID cases/hospitalizations pretty negligible. HVAC system building (owned SL Green) shuts 6pm, they're going extend hours. properly functioning HVAC system essential stopping spread COVID office buildings. one main goals behind premature push back office SL Green, largest office landlord Manhattan, see decline property values--you'd think they'd least give us another hour two air filtration!

Approval rating today. Welp. umm, Although laboratory evidence suggests antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination provide better neutralization circulating variants natural infection (1,2), real-world epidemiologic studies exist support benefit vaccination previously infected persons.

that said, posted recommendation. there‚Äôs israeli study came late august contradicts findings well. say, settled agree this, also still would sort ""lockdown"" whatever want call children 0-11. Schools, daycare, events obviously children cannot get vaccinated yet. I'm super annoyed son's school enforcing mask mandate homeschool now. Even mandate enforced I'm sure I'd send school anyway. much remote learning sucked, still 100% safer person school right now. pathetic bitches balls quit.

Cold weather making cases worse, *is* magic. cases already there; where's hospitalization death? Nowhere, coming. give references podcast (and think notes)  got cash, get months relatively uninhibited summer much needed mental respite worrying infecting loved ones. I'd gladly take another jab feeling.  We're starting boosters two weeks (probably), cases going again, 11x likely means personal odds dying get covid .1% less vaxxed. I'm saying over, keep chin up, get 3rd shot soon, almost definitely totally fine 3rd shot kicked anti vaxxers denying people medical care selfishly taking ICU beds. come doesn‚Äôt bother well?  demographic cited 2 100,000 hospitalized. hospitalized, 2% died. Whichever meant (hospitalization death), think that‚Äôs 0.1%.

It's 100% impossible would know drug anything based one personal experience. I'd love hear explain think know there‚Äôs even possibility ivermectin‚Äîor anything‚Äîhelping reduce symptoms keep people hospital, explored studied further? 

*It found ineffective.* absolutely ridiculous. *There's free, proven vaccine* dramatically reduces chances hospitalization saying stuff like this. Yep, right too. Mercer County, Ohio. bad. try tell parents live Columbus, Ohio....you'd understand. WHOLE different world. swear edge losing mind couple times. Ugh. Think vaccine winter jacket. Sure still get cold far less likely cold appropriately dressed cold. vaccine like going shorts, people might get cold likelyhood far greater. Vaccine also helps reduced viral load transmissibility.

Where say cold weather makes indivisible cases cases already there; where's hospitalization death? Nowhere, coming.

Deaths up, year year. always case. uncommon see ""100% increase"" mean doubling. way food distribution evolved was, first government distributing 11 million people city. living tall apartment buildings. buildings look impersonal, function lot like little communities people live long time know better. So, lockdown young adults students 20s bored restless wanted something do, decided organize food distribution, 2 3 guess building. given trucks vans would go wherever food was, warehouses etc., get food building. list residents. went back divided food labeled bags person household. would text household individually come pick food, one else would courtyard time. Soon after, able give people food choices, got basics going. Wuhan, policemen function little differently lot crime. People know policeman is. people unusual need, could call policeman. example, people ran dogfood. called policeman, said would figure get person would find many people building dogs, meantime give rice. pretty soon even pet food distribution worked out. work things like that. many Europeans still believe US friend Europe. faking card, make provider near home address. y'all said Australia recent police thing. LOL I'd agree staying unvaxxed impact others. children immunocompromised invididuals can't get vaccinated they're getting screwed choices made antivaxxers + antimaskers. Oh, I'm sure will. mean re-running trial with, say, 3-month delay instead 1-month delay doses sell vaccines. entity capable adding removing mask mandates every city, town, county state? impossible task, thus blanket policy.

I'll never understand people hate wearing masks, love big deal. I'm huge dude asthma rock N95 mask go store think anyone can.

All people bitching moaning minds lack empathy narcissism show. think you‚Äôre totally wrong let‚Äôs agree disagree  agree, Biden use French rule unvaccinated people crossing U.S.A. Mexico. pregnant August/September 2020 May 2021. lucky could work home whole time felt alone. visited OB every time without SO. couldn‚Äôt see baby ultrasound hold hand me. Even visits could possibly get bad news. gave birth mask wasn‚Äôt exhausting still comfortable. first pictures baby wore masks. got complications left alone wasn‚Äôt allowed visit us. almost died spend 5 days alone maternity ward able care baby. one parent allowed visit ped daughter one time needed got ER wait outside. got gestational diabetes increased risk. Also I‚Äôm Europe. pregnant breastfeeding women eligible vaccine today way late. got shot 5 weeks pp withhold breastfeeding anxious would deny vaccinate me. I‚Äôm relieved I‚Äôm vaxxed. It‚Äôs responsibility take care baby stay healthy keep parents. 

Over it‚Äôs physical side also mental issues devastating. small things add difficult experience. hope things normal get second child. Motivate inject something bodies. Whether motivation internal external question. I.e forced get fit socially (have job, attend school, fly airplanes, etc) change mind reasons. final hold outs irrelevant don‚Äôt need 100%. probably can't afford trip france anyways.  Checks balances? checks balances? wanting bad, shouldn‚Äôt dignify ad hominem goes. Every time wave finally ends think realize con. pandemic 100 years ago played way today‚Äôs thus worst yet come. 

I think aggressively removing restrictions mistake didn‚Äôt cost lives delayed final victory pandemic. 

When see 52 straight weeks numbers better 52 weeks ago, believe starting it. 

People keeping telling us past peddling false hope. 

The numbers lie. Deaths cases up, period. Israel administered 30 mcg that's have, they've approved, Pfizer sells.

I mean, matter filling syringe much, it? know long time Pfizer/BioNTech aiming sell vaccines they're selling now

I'm convinced true. E.g. vials approved 5 doses charged 5 doses. Later vials approved 6 doses charged for. bet we'll see Pfizer try children's doses. Oh absolutely absolutely hate, mean hate needles. one time I've given blood life damn near passed seeing big needle was. good. 
play stupid games, win stupid prizes. get new jobs. Furthermore, Biden made statement nine months ago. probably changed mind realized people whiny assholes need forced act society's benefit. Curious homeless population seems this? lived control 10 years back, can‚Äôt imagine insane I‚Äôm merely sharing first hand account, can‚Äôt expect understand felt; wife showed dramatic improvement taking ivermectin. fortunate severe symptoms upon starting it.

Ironically, HIGHER incident infection really SPEEDS efficacy study. people claim vaccine approved quickly understand. vaccines takes long time study tend rare. Due ethical issues, one attempt artificially infect people trials, let get situation naturally test efficacy drug. COVID, proliferation, study could concluded quickly abundant data could looked quickly.

Now, could long term study reveal something bad COVID vaccine? Definitely, long term harm GREATER delayed vaccine release? way IMHO.  current ones, best? wrong wanting one shot dealing once? great. Imagine make vaccine yet...  afraid of? go store? so, quite solid. Keep mind live uncomparable world today vs. phase 3 trials. certainly dismissed. regulation agency take precautionary stance here, certainly know Ivermectin could adverse effect people.

I agree, government even worse.  American. flew back Germany, I‚Äôm legal resident, otherwise, don‚Äôt think could gotten in. I‚Äôm pretty sure Americans allowed travel EU general right now, unless exemption (in case, actually live here, legal documents prove it).

What‚Äôs crazy, though, German government doesn‚Äôt require quarantine vaccinated. free exit plane go wherever wished, right away.

To me, short-sighted. still carry virus even you‚Äôre vaccinated, seems like easy way accidentally restart pandemic here. 

My daughter quarantine, though, since she‚Äôs unvaccinated (too young), I‚Äôm kind quarantining default (can‚Äôt leave alone home!), I‚Äôm thinking travelers plane came on, too. present proof negative test full vaccination, yes, mean also didn‚Äôt see someone left maybe virus, they‚Äôve become host?

Quarantine boring, sure beats accidentally spreading thing, needing extensive lockdowns again. Kind wish EU governments would require least 5-day quarantine, negative test result, us returning residents/citizens could walk around üòï. ‚ÄúI regrets! Except getting vaccine. video brought XYZ. Good cruel world‚Äù.

Pull one rubbish, we‚Äôre buying more. Except end shit still spread further. Better take 3rd 4th 5th dose though, make money scums. number people refuse vaccine plummeting. hard sometimes social media news media really get grasp happening. feels like 50/50 battle anti-vaxxers accept vaccine. isn‚Äôt really case. Anti-vaxxers minority. boisterous, obnoxious minority, definitely minority.

As time goes on, vaccine hesitancy rapidly decreasing. could deaths shifting opinions. could long-term evidence ill effects vaccines. maybe conservatives realizing it‚Äôs stupid opinion deny vaccines base largely old overweight, likely cause complications. fact every week, people changing opinion getting vaccine.

So things definitely looking Maybe one-way trip Guantanamo out-of-line drunkards assault airline staff due refusal wear masks.  hope don‚Äôt get hired anywhere interacting public  It‚Äôs absolutely selfish person doesn‚Äôt medical reason. Obviously. Don‚Äôt dense. Honestly, who‚Äôd want predator?  bad idea never got point surging delta wave lead plan changing could get implemented.

Originally, testing going done symptoms bad enough needed medical intervention. Otherwise would requirement isolate people known cold Covid.  I'm 30, thanks pandemic teaching you, taught me. Although, always thought meant go carrot hanging right front (from stick), beat said stick.

I mean, still make sense, maybe thats I'm fan carrots. unfortunate - them. manual labor quit job, may able find comparable job company less 100 employees, i.e., painting houses.  work fortune 500 company (or even run-of-the-mill desktop support job smaller company) quit vaccine mandate, good luck finding another job comparable company...    Got rid FB ago. 10/10, would recommend.  found article mentioned above:  Biden *normal* conservative politician looks like, whatever fuck republican party become. work manufacturing company 5000 plus employees, OSHA say almost everything goes there, vaccine requirement kind work hired, medical records needed besides standard physical test. vaxxed wear mask seems odd context work (not saying couldnt legal though).  Yes really fantastic news! increase vaccination least 5% many countries. not?! said it‚Äôs likely stay like flu. Again, you‚Äôre completely missing point reply. said ERADICATED means gone. Shoulda googled googled rest info. There‚Äôs always one guy. wonder idiot, unvaccinated sister do. shitty, racist husband. Please spout opinions facts without quoting source.

My wife pregnant delivered healthy baby without vaccine. waited 4-6 weeks baby delivered got vaccine.

There *absolutely* zero tests showing effects vaccines pregnant parents baby long short term.

The past year literal nightmare us, even doctors/OBG Kaiser said ""we know."" Guarantee guy gets COVID he‚Äôll go hospital beg vaccine. Hey, strangely, states already require prove register, usually state form ID. vote? 

No one requires show ID buy booze, show someone else drink it.

No one requires get ID drive, mandates show every time get car.

Want go on? 

Your bad faith argument laughable. I'm even opposed requiring ID's vote, opposed mandating closing places poor people go get they're work make far harder them, closing precincts near forcing people least likely car go places there's mass transit, demanding vote year get tossed rolls, even get STARTED lying bullshit dead people voting fucking gets caught every time someone tries it.....   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Jacobson v Massachusetts could also maybe pressured vote recusing ethics look bad them.  completely stop sick. get sick also significantly reduces chance ending hospital dying.  Yeah I'm worried myself. I'm concerned possibility still able carry virus potentially infect others. Took long? Good thing death bad outcome ever literally everything else happens good.  Fun fact, considering transiting Charles de Gaulle booking flight yesterday look appalling English translations (it's OK criticize it, I'm professional translator partner professional French translator, particularly appalled). Anyway, among many horrible confusing translations, kept saying exempt certain things ""cured"" COVID. meant recovered, found concept mildly amusing.

Luckily able find flight go CDG, necessarily translations CDG appalling airport transit even normal times. feel like want ban Americans close get Oof, did. based priorities year, appear they've done anything prevent happening OklahomaFans fault car accident? denied care well?

Healthcare right. Hell, serial killers prison get healthcare (as should). sure one universal healthcare turn around advocate shit. True. research infected, surviving, natural immunity pretty promising. still gets stifled. 

For instance new US policies (presidential executive order) federal federal contractors vaccinated. far read says nothing COVID recovered. sure natural immunity mutations. recently announced COVID likely stay so...

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bedded study seen drug causes sterility 75% men use it. study showing effects anti-parasitic virus dump enough kill human petri dish. healthy lifestyle matter cytokine storm body starts eating itself. also stop producing new variants understand every new case new potential variant. unless epidemiologist doctor one trust opinion educated people field saying crap. I'm sure confirmation bias invalidate opinion. us desperate prove smart strangers. use emojis really fires home. Feel free enlighten me, Webster. Good point. totally forgot SCOTUS could interpret things federal overreach, United States v. Lopez. However, case involved Congress subject explicit powers constitution, whereas scope authority executive possesses muddled. definitely interesting see.

Edit: optimistic though, original commenter said, private entities would keep mandate choice beneficial would interests event SCOTUS strike down.  Yeah tested positive. live Canada? Ontario specifically? yes are. Dr. Tam said 4th wave predicted worst one yet. soon! 50% income tax, deamed disposal, Capital gains, inheritance tax investments treated general. Agreed. NJ weird lot people hold political views anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, etc., fully vaxxed. also wear masks.

Source: whackos in-laws parents retirement complexes. They've got Fox News clubhouse damn jump get shot. They've even pushed anyone unvaxxed card playing groups meet-ups. talk boosters come up, back mask wearing public even though they're vaccinated. can't really figure reconcile political views continued allegiances southern state brethren's views masking vaccines... I'm glad dichotomy exists here. 

Also, think media CDC anyone, really, comparison continued levels masking distancing northeast versus states like Florida, Arkansas, Alabama. Florida almost many vaccinated various times NY NJ, ZERO masking areas low vaccination rates.

New Jersey, least area, still mask mandates schools. Areas CT, too, school weeks seen spikes happened parts country.

I think story masking works... really, really well. Better scientists even give credit for. They're acting like vaccine rates tell whole story northeast waiting turn, saying things like, ""Well, it'll go everyone inside, etc., goes hot Florida south cause A/C.""

In reality, disgustingly hot humid northeast summer. town New Jersey received NINE INCHES RAIN Ida blew threw less three hours. think I've ever remained inside A/C much New Jersey summer life people know.

The difference Delta picked lot areas, began seeing lot masking again, see probably 30-50% masked given location many schools mandate masks still. went wake last night shocked half people wore masks. Went Starbucks morning walk around 7am surprised see customers inside masked.

I mean... masks... they've done much anyone give credit for, feel like. sucks. Oh well, here's Wonderwall... mean NFL players required vaccinated? Great answer haha definitely specify postions    TGA safety report, nine deaths found ""linked immunisation"" 495 reported deaths August 29.

There's rub. Nine deaths, 495 reported. happens family submits vaccine death report they're sure grandpa stroke vaxxed, takes folks Therapeutic Goods Administration little figure way proving vaccine caused stroke. 9 validated deaths total. 

IMHO, 9 deaths need moment honoring, used excuse wriggle vaccinne booster obligations. Excuse I‚Äôm confused, thought determination coming OSHA, regulates federal safety regulations employers, presidential executive order?  Fwiw; preconceived bias prior taking it; Took doctor word started treatment. Agreed, though, it‚Äôs challenging articulate via text exactly much improvement wife showed starting it. 

After taking it, began research efficacy, curious it‚Äôs become controversial. Haven‚Äôt seen studies show wonder drug covid, also haven‚Äôt seen show completely ineffective.

That's true, vaccines end it, essential part ending it. Stop vacillating get vaccinated.   live Ohio, we're going get fucked. 9k near peak winter levels, feeling we're nowhere near peak.

It gives much greater chance getting sick. federal government's requirements ensure public safety generally limited national defense preserving republican governments states (Article IV Section 4). power regulate interstate commerce manage workforce, territory, property, requirement use powers fight contagion.

The ""selfish prick"" argument instance fundamental attribution error. agree saying, seem missing point. see arguing highest level protection problem given protection begin wane 2-3 months, mean need get booster right away? we're focused highest level compounded protection, what's stop someone gotten booster (say 8 months) demand everyone else same, even they've already gotten shot 2-3 months ago? **My question is, reasonable level protection needs maintained people threshold need additional shot, whether first shot booster?** 


Also, clarification, say 'People getting ""natural immunity"" ' mean ***'People natural immunity'*** people already recovered ended hospital again, actually mean people getting sick first time therefore ""getting natural immunity"" recover? I'm arguing people go covid parties obtain ""natural immunity"" -- heck no! That's insane.

That said, give credence idea really compelling study came Peru rest medical field sat want vaccine bucks. 

Presumably experts (i.e. me) read study found wanting. tried replicate study get results. Either way, overwhelming majority experts seem think far harm good. talks another lockdown Canada.

Currently virus burning unvaccinated populations. vaccine passports basically everywhere except Alberta Saskatchewan. 

Rather lockdown keep everyone away nonessential activities, provinces seeking limit population high risk, unvaccinated, nonessential activities. amuses unlike almost logical fallacy, people committing one call themselves.

Thought silly...it's also hard tell reddit. people tend jump you.  love Biden mentioned companies already this, included Fox News one hahaha  Thanks answer ! share playgrounds, restrooms, lunchroom common areas. pandemic kids school. Masks required n rarely see parent without one. 

however older hs got three warnings covid exposures already.  I‚Äôm hoping federal judge issues stay reaches Supreme Court overturned.  Clearly enough thoughts prayers help time needed most..

/s  Hey... mean offend - referencing bizarre incident someone caught fake CDC card. giveaway clumsily handwritten card called vaccine ""maderna""  Admittedly hamfisted humor part... link story...  Nah. right thing people sane mind wanted do. Screw rest. never going support anyways. Eventually they'll get find next thing put flag says ""Impeach Biden"" bet people call ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù.  Well that's really thing disputed.  
 
I've -like many people- reached point read 'Florida' official number whatevers, I'm extra sceptical. I‚Äôm remote zero possibility going office?‚Ä¶. Still gotta get vaccinated ‚Äúprotect‚Äù around me?..    we've tried approach failed. Trust say wish approach worked. simply cannot reason someone argument reason into. 

This partly true. cannot go reason. also need empathy. easy all. extremely complex exactly suggested entire time work.

No, didn't. Communities exist. instance, free therapy exist, society state trauma. Institutions lost trust society, need regain trust. suggesting carrot. problem: keep thinking reward punishment get nowhere. extremely clumsy way approach spoken antivax types. I'm well aware. likely civil unrest, rot jail belong.

14% US. Even states like Florida Texas. cannot put seventh population jail. Like third Florida.

I mean, literally cannot that, figuratively. could 2-3%. not, sizeable need put stop disinformation best simultaneously using full force law eradicate disease.

While disrupting disinformation networks work short term, resentment force used makes people get even radicalized. thinking seems nowhere worse go, wrong.

Resentment, resentment. want deal resented country.

People seem acting place fear stopped able think approach issue.

But maybe true society resources. seems society resources, already failed. failed, frankly.  Ummm...not sure trying find out. tons vaccines hardly breakthroughs. get damn vaccine help fellow man instead trying figure get vaccine. Trust me, better getting covid itself. Ask anyone who's it. effects covid much longer much much worse. So, new covid cases usa unvaccinated people.. breakthrough cases prevalent well? said I'm sure death toll also reach  going little complex that. ""The Biden administration relying powers OSHA‚Äôs Emergency Temporary Standards code, allows immediately enact rule ‚Äúworkers grave danger due exposure toxic substances agents determined toxic physically harmful new hazards.‚Äù

That regulation enacted six months final rule goes usual rulemaking procedures approved. past, agency faced litigation emergency temporary standards.""""

I think going challenged courts. Now, even eventually fail courts, 6 months now, many people would gotten vaccine. 

Of course, boosters needed annually something, US going need pass legal muster maintain consistent high vaccination rate includes booster shots. religious exemption full stop. Peoples choice believe magic fairy tales prioritised public health circumstance, ever.  Hey, like this, change settings share it, without anything? /s that‚Äôs comment see often Facebook.

You really get arguments stuff understand.  listen podcasts, Behind Bastards Don‚Äôt Speak German released episodes going week provided lot context popularized, errors data, it‚Äôs ineffectiveness. Buzzfeed also released article getting research flaws.

We've gotten nowhere near level wave. CMO recently said would currently around 10,000 cases day right vaccinations.

So vaccines definitely working far better place six months ago.

 may well peaked per above. 80% unvaccinated find France map  Dude wtf Yes cross checked ID it‚Äôs idiot proof. people like allowed run things, we'd never get pandemic individual would make poor decisions. That's already happened look awful we've done - worst world. 

Yeah yeah, know, care see yourself.

But hey, keep blaming people outside US. thousands Vegas weeks ago, Americans refusing still travelling sporting events near hundred thousand people..   incorrectly declaring victory

The way Denmark put together makes unlikely. cases serious Corona, decisions tend unanimous, nearly so. means political capital gained declaring victory, premature, otherwise. Everyone wins loses together.

Also, Danish experts, even pessimistic ones, agree time. No. understand situation U.K. Seems like fine order me. know many hate governments businesses long mandated vaccines. want green card citizenship need prove vaccinated several diseases. can‚Äôt well get handful shots time.

There never vaccine 100%.  one keeps huge majority hospital dying.  Sorry think failure. I'd happy explain why, like - reddit seems think drunk conspiracy theories, prefers mock us, that. Church Christ, Scientist actual organized religion actually opposed vaccines broadly (and basically forever)

Jehova's Witnesses also generally anti-vax, again, essentially long religion existed.

Those two know of. government. Otherwise simply get weekly test. third point really makes question legs have. can‚Äôt imagine won‚Äôt quick nationwide injunction here.

I‚Äôm genuinely curious requiring testing weekly deadly virus violates constitution. think proper way describe ""funny""?

My wife pregnant first 6 months Covid last year, psychological torture something wish upon anyone.

This type casually dismissive attitude people's suffering, true danger Covid.      already changed stance vaccination requirements remote workers, since another user pointed vaccines affect people outside home.

But regarding employers power conduct office, there's difference privacy home.

For example, getting fired sex public makes sense. Getting fired sex home makes sense, even ""on clock.""

I manage team 20 remote workers US. stance never changed, care long get work done. That's thing support collective bargaining.

Well believe UBI increase employee bargaining power well democratized workplaces power hands out-of-touch CEOs VPs. science sources misled entire time? hand picked sources YouTube allowed removing videos anyone else talking virus? sources initially told masks useless, said double mask up? sources?  I‚Äôll go grave knowing feared would happen turned world live fed fear substantiated.  campaign unvaccinated people (right wrong)? if, bear here, we're sick tired bullshit unvaccinated people think know better science medical experts? 

""Science/medical experts constantly change say!"" 

:O mean science/medicine constantly changing/improving learned? say! People get choice though. Get vaccine quit. one forced. choose get it. also must choose repercussion included. Polio almost contagious, severe. Measles whooping cough much contagious. said, think polio measles vaccines successes led us consider important. Mandating vaccines still pretty new would problem. fact there‚Äôs sort fine enforced government body directly already means greater chance adhered what‚Äôs currently happening. Right county set mandate abc local sheriff‚Äôs police stations decide don‚Äôt want enforce it. nothing happens break leaving people work usually retail environments enforce zero help police event situation turns dangerous.  Depends prod. Fair point. speaking bias personal experience country. work done eradicate diseases. think would alter point say proof well vaccine campaigns work people actively fighting behalf virus. I‚Äôm point complete disbelief Americans (and probably bunch countries like mine) get people vaccinated deadly disease. fuck get point.  Seems little hasty. 

Ikr? coming well balanced carefully considered group people!  even read Bible anymore. give kids required vaccines go school? develop courage later life? little hypocritical say everyone needs vaccine hospitals full, cut hospital capacity firing nurses. It‚Äôs crazy Biden got pass reason beefing hospital capacity. Nobody arguing voter ID. people arguing fact IDs cost money. effectively boils poll tax unconstitutional. Give everyone free ID won‚Äôt hear complaint it. Maybe even issue one people register vote.  I‚Äôve always wondered haven‚Äôt mandated flu vaccines least made employers responsible protecting workers catching work. Thousands minutes? worse woman saying babies 48 weeks old.  child COVID-19 cases resulted hospitalization

This still pretty bad. Death benchmark we're using. Plus CA data says 11.6% new cases children. means currently vector. isn‚Äôt fucking game. huge overreach tested COVID? so?  nephew...who also morbidly obese lives parents basement. AND, found COVID. wish making up. Glad you‚Äôve got figured out. good one! Lots people hospital they're fat. Heart attacks, knee injuries, forth. time. qualify 100+ employer? approvals all-time low right now, though. Culprits probably Delta variant Afghanistan, plus job growth metrics underwhelming. doubt one act increase approvals any. People writ large still view pandemic negatively starting blame Joe Biden duration. people, mean independents. country polarized dems support approve matter republicans opposite. 

The reconciliation bill would thing increase numbers, Joe Manchin (unethical pos) standing way. free easily quickly obtained all, sure!

But that's never part voter ID push. 

Remember, right vote constitutionally mandated free avaliable all. Unlike things person listed. different.  tests remain free, essentially forcing people get shot. believe it‚Äôs around 2.5 months now. defund entire police force.  realize minorities least vaccinated group people right?  Make sure asks reasonable accommodation, exemption. covered ADA. always upward mobility, that‚Äôs beauty country. that? think parents tech stick nose swab far enough cause sinus brain damage?

I saw lots kids swabbed parents drive thru site last week got tested, even car seats, don‚Äôt know age limit.  course safe assume dying lately unvax antivax, point people going overwhelmingly conservative, regardless blue county precedent mandated vaccination like brand new territory ever it?

Truth is, love mandates. two paid days going getting vaccinated waiting worst side effects pass. exactly fun games. making mandatory employers provide paid time get vaccinated pretty generous. See, still teaching civics classes. actually read articles.

Average American reason get upset anything anymore

I'm thinking bc individual mandate considered ""tax"" GOP pass legislation kill it, might apply, since part taxes fund unemployment, might apply. dunno. 

Whatever. I'm sick shit, anti vaxxers killing us, think vaxxed x date, denied care.     support this. almost year track records tht vaccine looks good. can't boot rhe virus Jay gang lessen impact society. want normalcy back. knowing, loving, omnipotent god would send people hell. wouldn‚Äôt make sense. narrow basic view heaven hell, yeah.

False equivalencies also point great job paying attention history class?

To make exceedingly clear: ones give two fucks old someone internet children. Go finish homework. It‚Äôs pretty normal right outside fear mongering subreddit tbh  hope so, trucking industry ducked. would drastically affect food essential supplies. turnover already 150% man, I'm going lie, I've thought it. genuinely have.

then, previous job transportation research thought driving truck scares shit me. I've seen things...

also I'm scratching head one, industry 150% turnover? trying think way also I'm tired  think might affect chances contracting much, severity contracted (comorbidity) takes courage stand minority principles. Others mock call stupid dumb. Imagine next interview. ‚ÄúSo, let go?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm selfish prick believes conspiracy theories refused take vaccine cost job. still think I‚Äôll make great candidate here!‚Äù Patron waits parking lot test results in. takes 15 minutes. 15 minutes up, patron gives security name radio back us.

I've fired people similar things hazmat work. can‚Äôt sue getting MMR flu vaccine either. Also vaccine prevent catching whatever virus you‚Äôre inoculated against. vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent potentially dying, give 15x greater chance avoiding hospitalization death unvaccinated people. Earlier posted probably gonna drive antivaxxers polls like nothing else, hand, never vote.

Honestly can't see factoring voting habits. already going vote gonna D. qualify quit fired cause. Here, complying federal mandate de facto cause. B E lack evidence increased protection

This understand people sometime. like see thought engineering time. Like sure, may yet evidence, best estimate harm either. Risk assessment probably shows best get Yeah, perfect time unemployed pandemic funds week.

Also, I'm wondering states sponsor people's unemployement quit get fired due vaccine reasons due mandate fault employer employee Yes still allow pto side effects? Vaccinated people died, yes. Many vaccinated people still gotten sick hospitalized. much less common, still happen. Y'all created cult around him, so. Imagine, creating cult around guy Celebrity Apprentice. fuck wrong y'all?  Welfare. health.

Otherwise would weight requirements. vax care feelings A-fucking-men.

Nah, qualify unemployment anyway. get quit fired cause. Exactly. Reminds son little, throwing tantrum wearing coat 0 degree weather:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll WANT TO, TELL TO!‚Äù Biden forcing companies something unregulated ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Id love go spend money. Target misses lol. haven‚Äôt 1.5 years. I‚Äôve saved much money. think made huge strides addressing cigarette smoke, like can‚Äôt smoke around people working can‚Äôt smoke restaurants. part (at least live) second hand smoke happens people‚Äôs houses.

Agree food think starvation prevention (hungry people revolt government, fed ones less likely to) healthy food shelf stable cheap like processed foods. think you‚Äôre right government‚Äôs approach food overwhelmingly control rather nutrition.

But totally fine initiative, honestly think go further. full mandate might less cruel wouldn‚Äôt force people choose employment vaccination status. would sweeping, I‚Äôm counts. However think people would FREAK (which I‚Äôm fine don‚Äôt think Joe Biden is). people choosing employment vaccination status, although it‚Äôs fabricated binary choice. Giving choice feels like indulging doubt bad faith ‚Äúscience‚Äù.  Ain‚Äôt fun rabbits got gun. Yay! Poop will!  I‚Äôm mocking her. I‚Äôm giving credit able make decision live/die consequences. 

Don‚Äôt infantalize her. She‚Äôs adult capable making choices. endless information value vaccines. It‚Äôs condescending patronizing wring hands adult making bad choice.   staffing companies great, nurses paid handsomely, should. $500-1000 start bonuses, completion bonuses, $1k/wk stipends, nurses making $120 hour working 70-80 hour weeks. someone actively works persuading people fence covid vaccine country, said exactly forces people away even further. 

It fault, also victim misinformation failed education systematic even rational persons swayed - abusing way go it. got shots one near earlier year.  really wonder people do. Hopefully thus increase vaccination rate - think important let people find way get vaccinated gracefully without ""losing"" lot people ""other side"" crowing they've won. hope resist urge politicize this. That's get vaccination rates up.  folks know mindset IT.

(Disclosure: also tech career)

This make sense me. Tech offshoot science eyes. Facts. Binary. Rigid instructions. field anti vax .... strange me.    It‚Äôs clear move today impacts next election much. think meta Covid story impactful. still stuck current state ( 1/2 people scared wanting more, 1/2 people thinking it‚Äôs blown get it) 3 years won‚Äôt good him. 

My county (San Mateo) 90% 12+ population vaccinated people still terrified Covid community spread still high. way new rule change much here. 

Only way forward mind us pivot away case counts care hospitals deaths since that‚Äôs matters vaccines help. Similar message UK new sources.   fully accurate. literally read required vaccines school said skip chicken pox vaccine doctor signs already it.

That said, reading I've done back, appears vaccines provide broad immunity infection reason still rewrite case. 

And agree, vaccine mandates anything new. That's anarchy. Duh certain sections reddit actively calling civil war Mmhmm great thing. curious though, OSHA power white collar jobs? I've never seen heard word OSHA job I'm curious company part it. Problem looking like boosters necessary immunity waning less year. may get vaxxed regulation goes courts falls anti-vaxxers get booster, we're right back started. Read article. federal employees exempt federal employee mandates without negotiating postal union. We've vaccine mandates going way back George Washington. absolutely overreach. Yes. provided evidence.

So, adult americans adamantly opposed vaccinating themselves. changed little bit. ""wait see"" people decreased. hand, ""only required"" decreased since june.

So core 14% hardcore anti-vaxxers get vaccinated matter hurdles. half people still unvaccinated (around 30% total).

And vaccine mandates quite chaotic, permanent work. requires controlling widespread fraud. usual vaccines, much much higher rrate besides, although 56% favour vaccine mandates, whole 32% . low something complicated firing everyone vacinated jobs  Maybe they'd fixed properly developers access printers office! Designed hours; tested year. think good principle, think would better act Congress commerce clause. upheld courts, think could dangerous precedent future presidents able unilaterally do--like expanded immigration status, reproductive health records, etc? Sounds like they're to.  far...quite long road ahead Florida, percentage going go  exactly treat 8 year old. ask nicely, sternly, take away choice. works. Hopefully effective see increase vaccinations. nonsense gets brought alot bears repeating comments were:

1. Made time man bringing sunlight disinfectant avenues explore cure

2. Specifically mentioned would trust FDA approved vaccine, nothing aforementioned clueless child would say safe, obvious reasons. approve vaccine mandates.  Texans ready throw Ted Cruz out. could replace democrat would fantastic. Bonus points they're christian, lotta people hard perceived persecution   Maybe finishing PhD virology. /s Ivermectin great removing worms bulls, bullshit. way full dosage approved &lt;12. Pfizer testing 10Œºg 3Œºg doses.    love fuckin' username üòÇ   It‚Äôs like airlines delay plane repeatedly 60 minutes time.  It‚Äôs like getting extended root canal. math here. you‚Äôre bean counter measuring human cost, statement costs 150x hospitalize vs vaccinate, actually supports case it‚Äôs cheaper vaccinate. 1 150 unvaccinated people get hospitalized, would cheaper vaccinate people. According stat found, 431 100,000 unvaccinated get hospitalized. That‚Äôs 0.431%. threshold beat 150x would 1 150, 0.67%. So‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs cheaper vaccinate people let .043% get hospitalized according article‚Äôs headline. 

I strongly believe abundance data supporting vaccinations justified. stat alone doesn‚Äôt. like used scare quotes word ""vaccines"" like literally vaccines. stupid. Good Yea pretty important one üòÇ What?? Yes it‚Äôs federal mailing system country war independence Washington mandated smallpox vaccinations entire army. Really, want get ""chiseled country of"" social distancing literally dying plague. vastly outnumbered, out-trained, out-financed. far away England kept dying preventable illnesses long enough Brits give up. strange live, rare die. get unemployment quit remember Johnny Cash's granddaughter getting cursed Nashville awful crime wearing mask getting groceries. sad state Tennessee is. Yay! finally oppressed!

[Two weeks later] Huh. sucks. I‚Äôm living this!! also win! absurd pathetic takes many people get vaccinated, still end result seeking first place.  5 months. people working ? going get ? taxpayers end paying like anyways, hospital-bound social menaces get credit scores demolished, estates liquidated cover fees inheritance. That's accurate. gotta minimum show vaccine card negative test Europe   vaccinated, option living life relatively low risk. Washington DC, I'm seeing friends, going baseball games, going eat, going vacations, going gym, etc. masks friends houses, masks eating out/at games. mask indoors required. vaccinated folks, many dangerous things Covid. Even this, worked Afghanistan many years many times dangerous vaccinated person Covid. point, people consider moving best enjoy life. pediatrician offer phone visits? probably need it, that's appointments require vaccinations.  bot fails lot. Bad bot.    sure states, California database allows quickly look-up someones vaccination status seconds. [Given folks face five years prison falsifying I'd say let fuck around find out. leiden, staf vaccinated, 85% covid positive personel vaccinated. vaccine going help? useless south african brasilian variant half effective english variant.  
in israel, 60% people severe reactions covid vaccinated.  
The vaccine answer. Would great. going work. We're actually going think way organised society want get this. anyone know they‚Äôd entitled unemployment benefits? Time brush resume get job Steve hogging last 20 years. That's great, want see consequences people resist. Well that‚Äôs expect less educated voters Unvaccinated people reservoirs virus origin point new variants. vaccines proven safe effective. 

Don't trust like mRNA? tried true adenovirus solutions like J&amp;J available. 

There literally excuse point (short legit allergy), given antivaxxers cruelest vocal currently unemployed people took advantage benefits... 

Maybe fired cause, thus meager, outright laughable, safety net navigate getting new job holding onto pig ignorant attitudes humble bit. 

This seems harsh, unvaccinated ones holding us back point maybe loss privileges might sets straight given they're acting like toddlers. Here's one chat. anyone offer thoughts?

I vaxxed twice , Pfizer, last shot 04/01. antibody count last week, returned result 145.00. WTF. thing think blood infection top unexplained case pancreatitis June, took ton strong antibiotics. make difference, maybe? I'm hot get third shot now, super curious observed: double-vaccinated people producing super low numbers antibodies. don‚Äôt know UK data looks like. US look CDC [Pediatric Data recent hospitalization children agree 5 11 year olds probably urgent need. However, see nothing wrong making available EUA letting parents decide.

The 0-4 age group however fewer cases lower per capita cases, yet top per capita hospitalization (in children) duration pandemic. think need vaccinate toddlers. mind???? think work!!???? 
10% workforce become unemployed chatastrophic law turned back. 
And FAVOUR vaccine, clear. Good. Sick coddling ignorant unvaccinated. Super curious conversation like right employment lawyers. antivax nurses probably mean 1/3? talking thing   Well, least people around workplace get infected case. 30% almost 100 million people. half number voters last year's election. second week school 7 year old needed go doctor caught cold (we know time). wait bad week August 10th. 

The weeks later doctors office slammed. Usually boys sick get day appointment call first thing morning. happening, gotta wait till next day. son's pediatricians office said 3x number visits 4x number phone calls usually get time year. took son doctor wait hold parking lot 15 minutes check wait car side appointment along 4 people side building.

Last year I'm sure sounded little crazy friends family keeping kids home covid. school year sick non stop things like flu, strep colds contagious delta. go back school year gotten sick twice month colds strep. make kids wear masks school. hope hold avoid covid they're able get vaccinated.

Edit: spelling near fortnight nothing said boosters government know around Sept 15th plan is. 'anti-vax nurse' sound like oxymoron?   Yeah. There's always middle ground found society highly infectious disease killed millions worldwide causing continual damage economy seems like good case intervention. always, worry government next hates give power regulation, though. Shit got real.

This going courts, quickly. need implement United Airlines employee vaccine mandate national level..sure religious exemptions, placed unpaid leave do..would put end b.s. real fast. bots fail.  company announced last night, since forced everyone back in, I'm still going office. multiple interviews lined coming days, look forward quitting.

I wait get covid shots earlier year, going back office point matter do. showed give shit workers, exodus already underway, dumb boomer CEO understand why. Time see honor that. Biden it‚Äôs greater good country. brother got first dose Pfizer weeks started incentives California back May refused finish missed cash incentive. idea might able convince get dose Moderna finish J&amp;J. Since J&amp;J single dose fully vaccinated point. anyone know California? Get one each?  will. Carving time go get tested every days pain ass. time go get tested every 3 days work. It‚Äôs super annoying even testing site right street. disagree vaccines, feel like distraction fact screwed alot people afghanistan. think it‚Äôs definitely going challenged court, I‚Äôm praying judge order temporary stays actions verdicts reached.  
This could totally work enough time intended do. Holy shit. Hold onto hats prepared. likely event triggers mass violence. vast majority get it. (while complaining lot)

I work post office coworkers going quit forced get it.

Shockingly got vaccine Biden started talking mandating month ago. would tough sell without full FDA approval.   religious exemption include detailed explanation theology signed official church issuing along complete list everything members can't do. duality response Cuomo‚Äôs handling data response DeSantis‚Äô frustrating surprising. love mandates, especially knowing going excluded self-selecting society. Win win. Right, ultimately helps bottom line (lower absenteeism, fewer disruptions, etc.).

Biden know kinds resistance, multiple failure modes, legal challenges varying success - meantime lot private companies able scapegoat get want anyway, needle move it.

There kinds political implications well - many end badly him. bold risky play, right thing do.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  genuinely curious, allow recent antibodies test result? Natural antibodies effective like vaccine. job deadline get vaxxed put legit reason so. 

I work home, circumstances (like power outages) require come in. It‚Äôs smarter require everyone vaccinated.  75% country vaxxed, wont wild Jeff Buckley. force big companies vaccinate employees, requiring least negative test airline passengers seems like big deal. sure story her, prosecutor charge attempted murder license drive removed permanent.
Of course probably already drives people around insane. Yes limit. country‚Äôs ICUs longer packed capacity easily preventable illness, back off. I'm literally double jabbed

Doubt ‚ÄúFuck around find out.‚Äù - Joseph R. Biden Yeah, it‚Äôs something long ago  fully vaccinated

Doubt got first two another state, probably get one current state difficulty. *official* guidelines, per current county's health department (and, say, coming CDC), third dose authorized immuncompromised/immunosuppressed people, cancer treatment patients, on. However, able find reason third dose time *unsafe*. I've trying find much reliable information gather.

About week ago CDC said [estimated million Americans already found unauthorized third lot research discussion seems centered around *utility* third doses, i.e., [whether world better giving third doses people want instead trying administer people doses *Reportedly*, difference formulation mRNA vaccines third dose, Moderna's half-dose (50 mcg) 2nd shot; [this also what's holding Moderna's third-dose since they're currently locking horns Biden administration, asking also collect data full third dose.

However, evidence third dose *needed* people otherwise healthy age 60ish, bit thin currently. evidence appears suggest third dose bring titers significantly, *might* reduce chances infection, nobody seems know high-enough titer prevent infection mild exposure Delta. ton confounding factors data expect recommendations change future, anybody's guess right way they'll change.

But personally, I'm weighing risk vs reward, reasoning doses available anyway (I'm taking one away someone wants one), appear significant risk far taking unauthorized full third dose (or even, reportedly, mixing-and-matching), could help maintain immune response prevent infection brand new blood clotting disease that's everywhere ... yeah, think I'm gonna find way it. is, sadly, spot on. Ideally virus wouldnt prone mutation concerns new strains although news far overly bad terms vaccine evading strains. far I've keeping anyway.

Ideally, unvaxxed problem would taking care itself. Many people unvaxxed end hospital survive hopefully realize done wrong get together. rest may worry *anything* anymore. GOOD WAY  maybe gets rolled next week? 

But get sense airlines begging that, worried bunch customers disappear. seems enough teeth get millions vaccinated. employers required offer test option say complicated, vaccinated work here? Companies 100 employees hook too. Continuing Require Masking Interstate Travel Double Fines

We've mask requirements long time. vaccination requirements airplanes interstate travel? 

We ID requirements, TSA security screenings, mask requirements. regulation mask quality like EU, vaccination requirements. Ridiculous. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm mad it‚Äôs federal government issuing it. state country city would mind. think it‚Äôll get shot court ever gets issued. Like I9 verification took 10 years implement amount education affect willfully stupid. mean it‚Äôs felony idiots large part risk city work says no. placed unpaid administrative leave Agreed. feel like may see shootings this. People already vaccinated like: meh... think absolutely could happened trump.

Trump lived things pissed enemies off. Biden Harris saying trust vaccine developed trump, may well pushed hard vaccination force dig heels.

Plus would best interest indeed bed pharma.

I would love able see timeline know far bizzaro world would become.  Thank god. Yea, weird. Back go! see war outside house havent seen taliban here. Clearly never war Afghanistan. 

If happen person never happened, right? Lol unfortunately family members willing honor that. throwing away steady pension pay ""studies"" done facebook groups consisting unqualified morons. honestly sad watch. Work conditions controlled employer employee remediated without impacting individual outside workplace yes. Forcing employees make medical call probably not.

OSHA cannot mandate things outside workplace masks 100% mandate vaccines probably can't pay attention 5 seconds hear part. That's painful, sorry guys went that. messed system. happens people refuse company doesn‚Äôt care? brother law still refusing. happen him? I'm saying important. lot. definitely painful. Maybe people administered shit it, know. two doses cost $26, add logistics, distribution administration, probably $30.

Also, $13 per dose low, deals Pfizer/Moderna $20-30 range.   cant get simple shot, get tested week. Leave that. thanks No, don‚Äôt put words mouth. say that. ask knew proved didn‚Äôt. Therefore don‚Äôt really reason bring up. going get hand basically force people get it. overreach authoritarian oo good know. emergency egress/elevators part OSHA though, part division government? would assume people requires exit signs office require apartment, that's probably OSHA right? get tested? Ngl, kind dick*, he‚Äôs 1-1 Ah ha! Well, kinda. didn‚Äôt absolutely helps strengthen justification department stating use. ultimately challenged court v probably upheld judges.  Interesting, thought unemployment lazy moochers? kind bullshit say?

And exactly going make unemployment extra benefits ended? think virus going eradicated?   Oh.. problems one time! 

Well, think biggest problems world. I'll tell problems never impacted one time lying. 

Go ahead. I'm waiting.   Testing FREE. get tested weekly. CVS/Wallgreens. insurance never ask it.    yeah, people switching jobs right really fucking us got laid people gap resume. two interviews i've far, despite pandemic, hiring managers/recruiters somehow still care unemployed past year. that's... fun

obviously anyone allowed quit job look new one time, I'm going like, fault someone - really poor timing us, lol. 

I receiving 0 responses (some unemployed really struggling right - hundreds applications, response) I'm sure something pull soon. thank well wishes! get tested week we're good. Stay home test positive, like rest us. Thanks.  ""I put toxins body"" bet something said before. Classic demo rat calling people disagrees names. much "" party love inclusiveness "" lol get tested weekly. DAMN Oops, gofundme raised $5000, there's 200k medical expenses.  money cake left. Yeah moderate progressive believes vaccinations third seem like bit overreach. understand support using power government employees contractors pulling work away sends message reaching private industry vaccination seems bit much.

This also provide opposing sides talking heads rip apart whole thing push heavier vaccine control reality health community.

Biden running like going reelection stands says least commits something know follow through.  employers safe working environments wanting hire non-morons? get tested week go work positive, end story. hard? contractor part interesting, lot companies hold contracts government employ workforce. part contract sub-contractors, legally speaking, government contractual authority over. Why? 

Drinking riding killed tons less. 

Was banning overreach? 

Where become overreach? 

In book, sometime 690k dead. simply look point view. misinformation feeds person, virus. receiving misinformation directly stoking fear family, makes focus dangers virus mitigation measures virus see wider picture community harmed opposition delay. 

You understand antivax rhetoric around long time, they've gotten very, good approach it. 

Is naive? easily fooled? downright silly delay vaccine long time? Yes all, likely would gone full antivax contracted covid. However, bigger picture blatant complacency social media web hosts part curb misinformation - people like find first place overwhelming volume hard look away. got Pfizer both. First dose arms little sore day two. Second dose barely felt anything. Went camping next day   apply congress people senators? so, mean stop masks congress? Well... look Fox News right now, actively campaigning getting vaccinated. goes education endorsement millions Americans. Hepatitis Turbuculosis genetic therapies

Wrong, mRNA vaccines effect genetic makeup way GUARANTEE moderate-high protection rate

No vaccine guarantees anything. Seatbelts guarantee die. However, statistically significantly REDUCE chance severe infection death. However, norovirus, keep washing hands. Yeh, next time hear bootstraps, someone's gonna get turned bootstraps.

If you‚Äôre vaccinated still contract snd carry virus. testing non vaccinated people useless. could theory vaccinated employee spread unvaccinated. 

It‚Äôs stupid, whole thing waste. businesses closing employees fact goods snd building materials ridiculously skyrocketed. Used vehicles worth 10k purchased new.. like wtf. Yep. point.

Fuck assholes refusing help get country past pandemic. get vaccinated get sick infect bunch people that's also people deserve option harm health others. least fully vaccinated people best greater good everyone.  feels little like comeuppance. Remember shit trump said pissed people off?

Well, feels. good society. CMUNSept Enjoy spike proteins, expect around beyond 3 years. recent college grad. Got degree English, returning student experience project management logistics.

I actually employed pandemic part County's covid response, mobile site registration logistics, looking another logistics job inventory counter, work grant, copy, technical writer, existing jobs super competitive.

I could go get service industry job half made COVID, tbh hard enough going job hunt life without twelve hour shift feet, ever get super desperate money, jobs still gonna hiring. It'd probably get bartending case, since bars everywhere pay enough, really like working clubs anymore. hours shit, busiest days friends want hang out, people hang work coworkers. Thank god biden, majority people ready DONE unvaccinated keeping us down. ounce sympathy me.

These people overwhelming hospital system keeping people need getting care.

All arse get free, safe, effective vaccine.

The world better without them.   thought awful procrastinating getting vaccinated June family friends got March/April, etc. guess people really live vastly different bubbles. true fat people, drinker drug addicts many unhealthy demographics.

Yeah, people hospital fat, hospital fat COVID-19. vaccine fat, drug addict, one COVID-19. use goddamn common sense. 50% US population obese, almost NORMAL fat. Damn, I‚Äôm sorry. Hope find something soon.  wanting quit job hopes finding something better, work home. Think I‚Äôll sit tight now. Good luck there, hope perfect job finds soon. ever encountered disease like before? Well, area, fucking are.  take even got J&amp;J covid vaccine?

It seems likely regulatory bodies eventually recommend mixing vaccines different types convenient so. you? It‚Äôs year half this.  lot people find religion get exception. 

The real question is, people issuing exceptions going test sincere religious belief is? religion dictating cannot vaccinated different priest saying okay want one. work Walmart get 3 paid days side effects, plus least 75 dollars, think raised. available in-store pharmacies. I'm sure retail chains doing, especially much smaller ones. similar, shame them. Huh must‚Äôve gotten lucky bought one last week, though sold cheaper Abbott one. worked far? KING QUEENS!! AHHH!! Everyone upset glad thankful end puts us back track normalcy without restrictions ability live life ease again. mean, thats basically referred constitution precedent, right? 

The irony current court literally stated ‚Äúthis order based conclusion constitutionality Texas's law‚Äù Well, based legal history. many people concern trolling?  Spoiler alert, won‚Äôt.     Soldiers‚Ä¶ work government army

So agree government mandate people command get vaccines let go. purpose. reaction exactly it. also get people side listen long enough start agreeing deliver punch. 

I'll confess one videos ended feed suspicious listened private mode. want feed get polluted bunch RW stuff. Instead, subscribed immediately. seems OSHA requires TB Hep B vaccinations already

Edit: mandated certain professions, seems would probably expansive mandate ever. first vaccination mandate m.  see coming from. something ""just because"" we're trained do, order tests because, give meds because, intervention intervention one without evidence given. Also, reasoning little bit hydrochloroquine ivermectin hurt either, properly dosed probably hurt you. (Don't take them, wouldn't, etc)

That said, that's coming surgeon know he's full shit cause half voodoo. ""Idk makes feel better"" logic behind fair surgeon idiosyncracies. places sold know iPhones cause head explode 15 years later? They've existed 14 years. next year move goalposts 20 years, like antivaxxers claiming every vaxxed person die. COVID proven, serious unlikely long term side effects seen SCOTUS lately? ***WARP SPEED*** wonder could get two unvaccinated friends hired large company sneaky way get vaccinated. Yeah, would people still unvaccinated point? gross.  Hahahah quite literally stumped replied ""well...slavery legal!!!"" 

Hahahaahah adults. ghouls.   think depends day source, LOL. comment based somewhat dated info, may right.   Everything complicated man‚Äôs racist feeble brain. aware long term side effects covid? curious I'll probably get voted opinion that's fine.

God, guys always add guys comments. Thats reason downvoted. already [vaccination requirements](http://rx.ph.lacounty.gov/RxVaccineMandates0419) public schools. basically adding one large list. sure people freaking out. clue, stores selling those. Turns main supplier pared back production Covid cases fell away earlier year taking ramp back up. 97% physicians fully vaccinated, well national average. 50% nurses fully vaccinated, well national average. numbers speak People completely missing point. alternative getting vaccinated: getting tested. Love capitalism even now.

Can't wait bums fucked around everyone's health find happens can't work, unemployment benefits run out, eviction moratorium rescinded. üòç Technically, are. Sorry dude 600k dead Americans virus 2 years lunacy. think appropriate response considering don‚Äôt something drastic, keep mutating disrupting lives killing people. 

It won‚Äôt last long, think get shot courts. might enough get us 75% fully vaccinated it‚Äôs worth shot. make Elon Austin Powers? give shit opinion Supreme Court? basis overreach power? see quite clearly within reach limited understanding laws constitution apply.  Notice ignored bit obese people.

Does OSHA right test weight employees ensure aren‚Äôt safety hazard? also shock available jobs insist people get low skill, low pay, long hours, upward mobility. So, work chain restaurant (I'm fully vaxed) wondering anyone could clarify vax-or-test mandate thing would apply. Cuz there's like 25 people work there, there's like 60 locations nationwide, cumulative there's obviously 100 employees. mandate apply, restaurants technically privately owned? home tests available now, ranging $20-40ish cvs etc states allow homeschooling require vaccinations children  Im fully vaccinated well isnt.  That's borderline cartoonist stupid is. worst part is, given current state things, can't say doubt actually happened. ""Super Long Covid"" will.

You certainly still care, especially since nearly half Americans fully negative test required vs either/or thing..? Negative negative someone card matter negative positive? get?

The side logistics resources testing. Imagine every single employee US goes on-site submits test every single day. Perhaps producing running many tests feasible.

I'm figuring next two boosters alpha I'm disappointed. guy laid groundwork public mistrust health officials vaccine scale haven‚Äôt seen modern US history. supporters ones getting vaccine, they‚Äôre ones dying. gears governmental necessity kept turning DC man flailed doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs absolved this. Damn, expecting anything forceful. That's awesome, there's gonna wild fallout this. guess good time look work anti-vax folks quit.  people don‚Äôt want work, guess.  Yeah it‚Äôs like Sweden, New Zealand.... idk else?? Again... ""this"" we're getting fourth surge point. keep fingers crossed future mutations vaccine-resistant. specific type coronavirus almost certainly become endemic going forward.   They‚Äôve least four months get vaccinated. wanted note California mandated two weeks PTO Covid-related issues, including getting vaccine vaccine related side effects. give religious exemption? feel like that's easy out. allow public school enrollment California, medical exemptions. Oh no! dare force us protect others can't get protection themselves! horror! /s  ironically don‚Äôt want work home. Home safe place, nothing work. employer foot bill pay dedicated separate building work detached personal residence. mean get completely opt entire system governance whim like everyone/everything else get to?  Would better STOPPED PAYING TREATMENT unvaccinated sick people allowed hospitals refuse treatment. realize read comment, think similar analogy used meaning carrot hanging stick always heard stick beat don‚Äôt take carrot. Prodding sounds much gentle üòÑ he's anything. he's asking federal agency (osha) something, trump (and every president really) time rate daily cases increasing slowed significantly, showing they‚Äôre start falling. like every peak. Man sucks. tried selling online? Employees health insurance. patient. patience wearing thin, refusal cost us‚Äù

B E Mandatory vaccination requirements COVID cases still keep happening. Thanks!  uses much resources costs ton let people die slowly hospital. funding higher insurance forever. Also longer goes less people go out/spend money/go workplaces like.. huge drain economically let people dawdle know this. 

Those mad already making stink threatening teachers/government/hospitals/stores.. Probably unpopular opinion, think new mandates extremely alarming. Especially stage pandemic vast majority adults either vaccinated gotten COVID already. 97% doctors fully vaccinated. said, I've met several skeptical booster due lack evidence increased protection expect might compliance. Also third shot KO'd vs first two bother much might hurt compliance too. Glad work myself, mean vaccine. fuck government forcing upon people threatening unemployment. Fucking cowards  would say deal, exactly? Couldn‚Äôt go self-employed rout least?! Poor kid. Sigh, would've good read. Huh--didn't realize could OSHA enforcing presumably combination random audits complaints. See agree extend. think I‚Äôm frustrated executive branch become powerful, sides aisle, longer hand 3 equal branches like 2.5 could argue politicalization Supreme Court it‚Äôs even less that. 

It‚Äôs high time congress gets power back - courts aren‚Äôt judged politics get third fourth party mix.

Edit - states need manage business  hope Im sure pfizer developing thing dont worry  really want testing k-12 schools especially 12. testing expensive regular basis. People aren‚Äôt going take kids appt it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. also aren‚Äôt going fill closet $25 tests. need cheap whenever. People literally murder try ruin life opinions vaccines, politics general. interesting weeks.  I'm glad capitalism healthcare protect us unnecessary harmful wait times hospitals like socialized medicine countries. Santa vaccinated?  necessarily stop deaths though. People still refuse shot work small business, work all.

What definitely make many people choose forced injection career. right? government mandate this, draw line? else mandate later on?

If government really cared health, would mandate things like banning fast food, sugary drinks, cigarettes, things like that. never though. care health... care control. Anecdotal, employer let employees work remotely. clearly stated every policy change regarding COVID precautions policy applies every employee, matter work. includes recent weekly testing mandate instituted. test results must provided leader.

I fucks give, though. I've vaccinated since March. still daily check-ins, work remotely mind minor inconvenience. Plus occasionally go (IT). I'm glad office separate building one hospitals. would even relevant here, surely implemented requirement employment, matter location still working company. they‚Äôll happily collect unemployment benefits calling darker-skinned unemployed individuals lazy mooches.  reach goal without state mandate interference extreme level relatively ""small"" full vaccination quote (under 60%) though.

I'm Germany know US statistics, ICU's never reached breaking point even height pandemic fully unvaccinated population.

I saying without positive effects, way proportion terms severeness mandate. UüëèSüëèA   Honestly right. I'm really sorry outburst. lot things look foward too. There's still hope friend. cannot strike down, well within OSHA's rights protect health general welfare employees US. safety question answered months ago. millions Americans countries citizens gotten third dose. thing stopping authorization incompetence among three letter acronyms.   Well - also quite lot people don‚Äôt celebrate Christmas. Happy holidays works everyone.

Wouldn‚Äôt find annoying everyone wished Happy Fathers Day every time bought something June even though ever father, didn‚Äôt one life, didn‚Äôt celebrate it?  almost certainly lot vaccinated folks don‚Äôt agree mandate. wouldn‚Äôt assume people opposed antivax morons.   boon entrepreneurs/s!    Whats saying use? Fuk around fine out? Time see people saying they‚Äôll quit face reality based logic getting things done. ü¶æüßë‚Äçüî¨üá∫üá∏  ""Idaho also last among U.S. states 45% residents received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, according Centers Disease Control. 40% residents fully vaccinated, making Idaho 48th nation compared states Washington, D.C.

""For rest state, remain dangerously close crisis standards care,"" Idaho Department Health Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen warned Tuesday, nine available intensive care unit beds entire state. ""

Well shit Sherlock. group people adamantly wanting vaccine, result.

Outside children, people cannot vaxxed due legitimate health reasons (compromised immune system one), everyone access FREE vaccine. I'm one family that's vaccinated. I'm mentally preparing complaints. they‚Äôre welfare queens. They‚Äôre true American patriots need it‚Äôs okay. /s  American Airlines too.  Good let's see hit 15million job openings. Maybe get $20 McDonald's hiring going on.  r/confidentlyincorrect lmfao

As another said NJ one them. Florida little grey area, poor performance disqualify unemployment misconduct will.

And I'm wasting time looking others, cause kind dumb rude.    think planes you‚Äôd hard time requirements significant amount international laws travelers. vaccine mostly unavailable population earth. vaccine requirements entry tho. Nope. OSHA    Currently company paying rapid tests (and guess gets administer nurses ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) I‚Äôm really hoping honor way forces coworkers get vaccinated. I‚Äôm immunocompromised, don‚Äôt need sick people around normal situation let alone covid. Ugh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time. visits hospital profitable  Oh man, didn‚Äôt massage days company funded office happy hour/open bar month, addition blood drives flu shots. Also free cpr certification courses. Fun place work. know ? Take chance Americans 
Show world Second Renaissance. 
Those choose forfeit work ignore science ..throw sewer system.
Rise , move onwards upwards sake Darwinism 
This good news   Yes, apparently weird kink has. Every time consentual, asked could women agreed. However kinda abused power big time comedian, coming comedians want say request.

It abuse power acknowledges it. Yeah I'm completely on-board short-term, pandemic needs end yesterday many reasons, apprehensive idea certain former president may re-elected (or somebody similar elected) using power OHSA force medical procedure population.  
 
I hope drive immediate surge vaccinations, also mind seeing Supreme Court rule afterwards remove tool future presidents' toolboxes. climb ladders backwards house get fired weekly testing every employee unvaxxed employees? work already policy unvaxxed employees vaccine requirement. hope God encourages company enforce mandate. like 91% vaccinated, work directly. hate it.   like lot, state this?  Mr. Nice Guy. Yes, cause civil unrest.

You know also causes civil unrest? hospital systems shutting unnecessary suffering.


Desperate times call desperate measures. unvaccinated need pulled bright future us, screaming kicking not. Midterms, dude. Gonna blood bath.   honest politicians. can't rethink something never think beating stick one used dangle carrot. Acquaintance...but friend?

Gee, wonder why... I‚Äôd bet lot RNs higher level.  assume would rely state issue penalty? would 'state press'. 

What actively killing people highly contagious virus. Hyperbole helpful solving problem ignorance. another version it. That's extremely rare unique set circumstances. vast majority adults situation. Yeah, understand that. going interesting see apply higher education institutions accept federal loans Pell Grants. Make things worse what? enough push us line sort immunity reduce strain Healthcare system worth it.  government hate that. anything last 40 years America marked government giving whole lot regulation, intervention, tax collection. Ignorant  treat overprotective way, antivaxx given benefit doubt, wait FDA approval, allowed exceptions. Antivaxxers coddled. needs stop. fuck around stage lives...   Heard different renditions ending always same. 

God provides. refuse see hand. Pretty smart. wondering telling 100 million people get vaccinated legal. Based Biden üòé  raises really good point big pharma though. Like threshold mandate? dangerous virus be? effective vaccine be? Lot concerns government power like this- we're sort trusting gov always make right decision us. I'm comfortable that. believe plan 2 term POTUS get go.  
OTOH, Trump wanted 1 term get it.  
One get wanted;  continue stew get lackies fight fight him.  


BIden leave office head held high. Also everybody works government contractors

Excuse ignorance entail? case COVID vaccine see merit argument unvaccinated violate others' rights unintentionally spreading virus. 

1.	The delta variant presents similar transmissibility vaccinated unvaccinated individuals (CDC)
2.	Anyone choose get vaccinated, reduces chance hospitalization almost zero
3.	The virus typically mild children age 12, cannot vaccinated
4.	For immunocompromised individuals, wearing N95 face mask along precautions sufficient

The number people cannot vaccinated high risk complications COVID-19 low. fact, compare 1% population severe peanut allergy. yet talk eating peanuts public violating personal liberties others impose peanut ban. essentially expect group people take proper individual precaution. can't expect small minority people cannot vaccinated high risk COVID complications? Hmm, thanks explaining.  citizens supposed act like children asked contribute keeping safe. are. Yep, Ivermectin U.S. Government (unvaccinated) Afghan refugees coming states. Huh, that?  I‚Äôm wondering affect that. police absolute worst nothing city. They‚Äôve slow couple years now. 

This would perfect solution baked problem. Tucky Cee woooh wooh! ""or test"" makes pretty much many countries end spring wave. far smaller companies 100 people. Tribalism, plain simple. Nothing matters ‚Äúteam‚Äù. 

These also people said pandemic would ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù day Election Day. Like public health officials media ‚ÄúWag Dog‚Äù conspiracy Trump. almost year later, still talking pandemic‚Ä¶. That's proven yet. Assuming right, time court agrees you, companies already fully vaccinated.  said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making things point‚Äù 

Yet said said HIV blood table transmitted it‚Äôs dried. never said did. 

You‚Äôre disingenuous it‚Äôs disgusting. 

How going make something didn‚Äôt say reply back say I‚Äôm making things don‚Äôt understand. 

Dude bye. You‚Äôre fake aren‚Äôt finding truth looking win. Fk wasting time. literally thought wanted discussion you‚Äôre fake. 

Yup u don‚Äôt even know wtf you‚Äôre about. Yikes vaccinated icu nurse emotionally pulverized pandemic, makes sad.  Except President supposed parent...free country. Paternalism sucks  been? There's huge labor shortage everywhere. Every business drive buy hiring signs out. Lots businesses around reduced days hours staff. wife's work buying breakfast lunch every day trying get work cause short staffed. Schools area can't run busses enough drivers. research clear. morbidly obese, pre existing conditions, get vaccinated.  Unfortunately, can't reasoned unless find ICU fighting lives. Even so, that's ""maybe"" almost like truly believe something right live please. vote kings Fear needles. know expats can't afford stick around 2nd dose flying looking one-shot, J&amp;J scary sounding mRNA one, etc.  Whether virus originated due dishonest China whether blame still mean current dumbasses America can't get vaccine wear mask. pandemic could originated Germany care still responsible respond it.  Imagine growing knowing twin died never knew. Great comment.  Requiring accountable principled (like believe science medicine, quit jamming hospitals get covid) anything requires personal sacrafice going happen them.  We've already seen action. 6 months late. me! I'm really fucked. covid- natural antibodies I'm early 20s.
But fucked workplace that's sure  insurance? would anyone specifically want one worst vaccines there? Usually getting picky go Pfizer Moderna company LOOOOOVING IT!! fucking Schadenfreude-glee get this. icing fucking cake me. I‚Äôve* long *run patience fucking selfish assholes, puts god damn pep. in. my. step. see anti-vax morons squirm btwn effective science joblessness ü§£. 
I get popcorn zoom meetings now! ü§©
when covid/vaccine updates turn camera, go mute cackle reckless abandon covidiots struggle consequences dumb-fuckery.
*Chefs Kiss* üíã new exercise 'that's power.  Fox mention part hence parroting. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.  live state highest vaccination rate, area highest state mask compliance. able resume normal activities, thanks that. even going school, loves.

I supposed care weekend, suspect there's way hell would get sick.

I hate hate hate fucking virus. boyfriend's 89 year old mother now. hospital none children her. USA jobs bout light up.    heard testing boosters NV - although without flu component - UK, US, know anything more? 

It's impossible get information what's going what's going happen near future. always nurses? know several anti vax nurses doctors.. cannot see patients inflamed intestine apparently believe that... me?  Absolutely! I‚Äôm looking forward well. already know one knucklehead probably quit want job. Honestly need see numbers actually working. history previous vaccines shown enough evidence trust scientists. fuck humans skeptical things already knowledge of?? species fucking ridiculous. work Healthcare system mandated months ago like every year influenza. small amount staff quit made staff shortage already effect worse. surprised many nurses anti vaccine. They're offering $1000 new employee referrals talk upping $2000.  Socially, yes. 

WFH embedded. Big improvement 2019 imo. Biden‚Äôs administration admitted might stand know bs media talking point. 

What Biden company's don‚Äôt force anyone get flu shot.

Yes do, extremely common like changed HIV example gave towards way makes feel like don‚Äôt understand do. need tell you‚Äôre right everyone else wrong. It‚Äôs coping mechanism get it. 

You're making things point

This conversation over. understand talking all. Enjoy life hope loved ones safe healthy. kid fine. flu, car accidents, drownings dangerous kids. Please perspective. US track 75% adults fully-vaccinated within next month. Sure, kids yet, expect soon, doctors able prescribe vaccines kids feel child risk.

This outside realm possibility us, particularly goes well them.  Better part problem. second time arm hurt couple days mild headache. know people trouble first shot better second. Ya, firings OSHA violations non-UE claims, go UE claim, easily appeal(and nearly 100% win) really substantial change working conditions, since nation wide literally everyone going requiring it, would doubt falls rules substantive change, entire industry changes provide XX chemical instead YY chemical, change too, refusing work YY chemical safe way would non-substantive change working conditions. way get away making paramedics, firefighters nurses get TB/HepB vax working, thinnnnnnnk that's they're going this, knows? would imagine use frame work.  Tough spot. Trying hold NC get worse. 

And get worse. lose dem governor bet whoever replaces turn us next Florida Texas short order. Source rule cost?

I got FB argument defend lol train way work now.

Everyone wearing mask, move closer London maskless people alight train; majority wearing.

Mask wearing still big thing here, fair enough pubs clubs be, pubs lot people still using outdoor space, change winter sets in.  yet another grifter. get religious exemption you‚Äôre member‚Ä¶ costs $11.    got vaccinated months ago one drive locations, supposed new job started, right got 2nd dose switched work home, single instance I've needed since I'm home like 99% time, idea vaccine card cause use leave desk last 5 months disappeared. Guess I'm gonna figure get new one. even know company gave vaccines cause drive insurance needed place. Wait, vaccines optional US?  something deeply tyrannical this. deeply unconstitutional. 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated congratulations. Covid longer threat. able live like doesn‚Äôt exist. 

If you‚Äôre unvaccinated, that‚Äôs problem. aren‚Äôt threat vaccinated. 

Joe Biden needs stop protecting me. tools protect me. 

This ploy distract Taliban fiasco 20 years 9/11 weekend. It'll take breath away   Except ones come federalist society. shit legal? It‚Äôs *visible* hand controlling one levers government lmao Curious here, someone fake test swabbing anything all? I'm clueless self tests, could see abused. ever got one test applied another last year could get vaccinated. efficacy smallpox vaccine mRNA sars cov19 vaccine same‚Ä¶the vaccination rate population difference‚Ä¶people got vaccinated high enough rate reach heard immunity.   Also work IT. whole team already willingly vaccinated. guess like work home mandate start this, team ""Oh guys something different now? must novel"" interesting see plays them. One constant far pandemic politicians incorrectly declaring victory, see country suffer new waves virus. Anyway, hope right provide glimmer hope rest us. Trump: ""If TEST much problem!""  Scumbag Steve. mean, don‚Äôt think won‚Äôt impact, considering done would disaster.

Also, dems don‚Äôt show midterms don‚Äôt Trump vote time around repubs going make referendum Biden vs Trump. wish company would tired pushing couple months time read room see things better position. Completely agree that, especially doctors idiots. 

Again, experience. Hate generalize, that's feel. Case point, Nurses US Canada, leading ton Anti-Vaxx rallies, giving perceived medical legitimacy lunacy. stats site misleading compared numbers used seeing. using total population including ineligible receive vaccine. US 53% example. 80% Israel's eligible population received vaccine, correct originally vaccines 13 dollars each, AFAIK.

Source: scandal country government tried purchase 13 dollar vaccines 14 dollars each, putting extra 1 dollar pocket.   $14,000 fine per many times though? Once? Twice? Annually? 

As signs indicate Covid us forever capacity. good news becomes transmissible also becomes less deadly. 

That said will, like flu, still pose risk elderly, co-morbidities. make flu shot mandatory? 

Perhaps- logical thinking would us limit ability co-morbidities play factor. 

What‚Äôs biggest co-morbidity? Obesity. (And heart complications related obesity and/or life choices.) isn‚Äôt discussed? it‚Äôs taboo hurts people feelings. 

So people choice feel good choice obese? can‚Äôt choice vaccinated? 

I pro-vaccine. believe science advocate everyone get compassionate education. one forced. it‚Äôs going forced diet exercise. wondering country socialized medicine like Canada would different experience USA regarding vaccination rates hospital utilization. little news story seem made difference. anyone comprehensive view?  saw jumped right Facebook absolutely spice yet. I'm surprised get news Reddit Facebook tbh. Don‚Äôt pee soggy biscuit good, fuck em.  LAUSD F‚Äôs left give! large population anti vax get vaccine mandate

Then stay home.  failed compete misinformation playing politics. Remember Biden gonna make go away? painful must (and I'm sorry), gives advantage direct, compassionate insight epistemic crisis. Many us close contact, makes bewildering. Yes. things like take time. Proper testing periods, etc. let political philosophical leanings influence commentary, although obviously, comes left, right. Mr. Bodymassagemachine GO! established precedent? company doesn‚Äôt. employee does. That‚Äôs part point. That's true too, context subthread people fired refused get vaccinated, problem finding replacement vaccinated workers jobs. Sure jackass Except can't take mask eat it. go outside lose place line. Ivermectin thing happening uhhh days ago lol commenting ""where timeline get fucked up??"" feel like karens working service industry jobs would correction needed  seem like worst COVID anti-vaxx news comes TN? what‚Äôs next? Threatening prison time? honestly doesn‚Äôt seem like stretch now, silly sounds. 

We expected vaccine silver bullet. reality COVID years least , experts seem say.   Agree. I‚Äôm tired running show. [Why 11% Israelis still broken religion level religion, majority unvaccinated either haredi (ultra-Orthodox) 24%, Arab 21%, 11% traditionally observant 6% secular 8% religious religious-Zionist respondents. posted another thread schools need funds cover teacher sick leave mandated quarantines. colleagues docked pay sick leave gone - even required go quarantine due ill student classrooms. Last year 80hrs CARES money/protection. exist year. Anyone works caregiving gets public funding support sick quarantine leave. That‚Äôs barely whiff carrot /r/fuckthes   Also established precedent SCOTUS 100 years ago?  Would catch eventually  dont know US, anything like canada never actually happen matter hard government tries. Dude literally letting people die cause hospitals full. Yes bad. many things list government forces us will. lady right made internet famous wrong reasons. friends sister super antivaxx vaccine. city instituted vaccination weekly testing. Guess did? üíâ  Probably accurate lol. Goodbye carrot, hello stick.

It's stick dumbasses.

Fully aware human beings understand plain common sense. OSHA every mandated vaccination before? /r/nursing hardly research, [but looked occupation 15-60% depending state, Florida severe moment 89% occupation.

Overall 14% higher 2019. legitimizes state mandate magnitude highly questionable.

But german defending personal liberty reduction state interference private affairs american seems absurd honest, looking forward mandate, ""fine"" guess. Love idea! 10th amendment abandoned almost century ago. right principle, matter. right, choice. choose get vaccinated, choose unemployed. unvaccinated untested employees workplace arguably presents recognized hazard employees. Somewhat late party but‚Ä¶ 
This great news! 

I sure HR / Executive management around country sighing breath relief. 
They longer hook taking responsibility push company wide mandate out. 
Now government made decision them. 

I beyond pumped day finally make real progress towards getting control. 
Many go kicking screaming, want keep job to. 
Let‚Äôs see dedicated antiva cause! quit don‚Äôt like rules? ‚ÄúMy body choi‚Ä¶..‚Äù

Denied. Inject veins please thank  u get communism that? would think, no. Apparently threat death incentive enough. LAUSD fucking around!  Thats company clinics later afternoon fridays Yeah apparently so. don‚Äôt understand either. information, judges also lot leeway. Getting right (or wrong) judge make difference.  admire courage

...despite total dumbass? Companies required offer testing option people could take vaccine. lot companies require vaccination done it. OSHA rule gives excuse it. Under-12 approval comes FDA. doesn't, shouldn't, can't come politicians.

It's even 100% clear US vaccines better under-12s infection is. hand highly (not 100%) likely could prevent hundreds child deaths vaccinating now. understand slowness. spoke US, said sufficient infrastructural support. sure asking me. nurses quitting hospital wife works vaccine mandate.

Unrelated, hospital low nursing staff paying $10k week travelers. mean like communism? love communism. Lots nurses extremely intelligent. like job, idiots, easier notice context. plenty idiot doctors, too. wins Republicans 2020 razor thin. talking couple hundred made difference. 

Those couple hundred dead dying hundreds next week. 
And next week that. 

And next week that. 

You savy?

Thats talking heads (and even Trump) switched telling get vaccinated. losing people 5 1 vs democrats. Boosters pending FDA authorization recommendation ACIP. White House HHS kind jumped gun announcement. exactly failed catastrophically far.  funny patriots love killing fellow Americans much free get drunk, load kids car, drive downtown fast want? free smoke airplane?

No. reason laws behaviors. please show laws compel mask wearing taking covid vaccine, forbiding people going around spreading beliefs vaccinations? 

So unless people United States, elected representatives, pass laws regulate something, people free want. I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúwhat would you‚Äôre charge ‚Äú kind argument fact I‚Äôm won‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm pandemic task force responder ; I‚Äôm kind manager even. know threatening jobs jab seems much I‚Äôm government forcing anyone anything will. number countries anti-vaxx knuckleheads too. explain that? 

Not every country America? stupidity irritates me

It's unrestrained malice, lack human compassion basic decency. idea fucked political ideology matters heartbroken teenage pleading right front eyes

The world truly would better place every single one people Thanos-snapped away  Exactly. much good peace hopefully plan :) Actually mRNA vaccines quite different. Safe far? Yes. Effective? Seems way. vaccines required? all. New technology without long term human studies. benefits rolling long term effects dice outweigh risk near term pandemic? Probably.

Talk cheap, lot harder find another job

Especially since basically company go likely also require vaccine.

I hope eliminate unemployment voluntarily job this. sure matters. 
Fully vaxed. first 1000 people Oklahoma receive vaccine. next weeks going critical determining we‚Äôre headed US. think watching Midwest upper south particular right now.   Stop reminding us. Send help [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Give day so, take people ignore, FB disappoint :) mean to""support"" natural immunity? side effects (for flu covid shots) generally innate immune response. theory wouldn‚Äôt make massive difference. 

Also Even you‚Äôre sick immune system never stops fighting pathogens. It‚Äôs like small cut suddenly becomes deadly cold, runs sniffles together deadly (in healthy immunocompetent people).

Your body plenty capable dealing it. 

Your body essentially go regardless whether it‚Äôs single vaccine combo vaccine. immune system generally capable dealing many things once. vaccine, unemployment benefits. Same, got Pfizer past April. sounds funny say ""you get *last* year's vaccine &lt;50% efficacy"" instead focusing booster delta-specific shot. seems like much, late.

I'm doubtful spread stop even everyone possible vaccinated. 12 still spread it, vaccinated people still spread get virus.

To clear, I'm pro vaccines. think weird require everyone knows breakthrough cases prevalent.  boomer. worth, still need get jab get job. Yeah, girlfriend refunded. That's actually found cancelled.  matters, also vaccine technology developed literally decades (including human trials since least 2011).

Because decades work, vaccine quickly target novel virus. That's whole point. feature scientific miracle, bug.

Flu give healthy, young people long COVID. really can't understand people say ""no hospitalization? flu bro"".

The latest - - study showed rate long COVID halved vaccination. still leaves wide window open lasting effects.

Lastly, without boosters, without 12 getting vaccinated, forcing rest population get &lt;50% efficacious vaccine **not** stop spread. coming someone pro-vaccine, got mine first week available.

This move keep people hospitals continue tracking breakthrough cases, real progress.

Monoclonal antibody specific supposedly good antibody chosen many antibodies different part virus.



Convalescent plasma mixed bag depends convalescent patients gave it.



And severe patients, even best antibody used monoclonal antibody cocktail work.


Probably, problem severe patients lack antibodies possibly;

* much antibodies and/or lack antibody clearance
* presence bad antibodies, like auto-antibodies, afucosylated antibodies, etc.  vaccination numbers *are* needed? Studies reporting efficacy (against infection) 50% point, what's needed control spread? 98%? We're getting anyway given &lt;12 can't get vaccine far.

This seems like desperate move, way late. need boosters.  That's kinda hilarious naming weaker epidemic strong pandeming, beta alpha version.

Abstract 
Background 
We others previously demonstrated endothelium primary target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), L-arginine shown improve endothelial dysfunction. However, effects L-arginine never evaluated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
 
Methods 
This parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted patients hospitalized severe COVID-19. Patients received 1.66 g L-arginine twice day placebo, administered orally. primary efficacy endpoint reduction respiratory support assessed 10 20 days randomization. Secondary outcomes length in-hospital stay, time normalization lymphocyte number, time obtain negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. clinical trial registered ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04637906. 
 
Findings 
We present results initial interim analysis first 101 patients. treatment-emergent serious adverse events attributable L-arginine. 10-day evaluation, 71.1% patients L-arginine arm 44.4% placebo arm (p &lt; 0.01) respiratory support reduced; however, significant difference detected 20 days randomization. Strikingly, patients treated L-arginine exhibited significantly reduced in-hospital stay vs placebo, median (interquartile range 25th,75th percentile) 46 days (45,46) placebo group vs 25 days (21,26) L-arginine group (p &lt; 0.0001); findings also confirmed adjusting potential confounders including age, duration symptoms, comorbidities, D-dimer, well antiviral anticoagulant treatments. secondary outcomes significantly different groups. 
 
Interpretation 
In interim analysis, adding oral L-arginine standard therapy patients severe COVID-19 significantly decreases length hospitalization reduces respiratory support 10 20 days starting treatment.

Research context 
 
Evidence study 
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) infection spread worldwide, causing disease mortality, well social disruption economic loss. Endothelial cells shown cardinal target COVID-19, L-arginine known improve endothelial dysfunction. PubMed medRxiv preprint searches updated June 24, 2021 using search criteria ""SARS-CoV-2"" ""COVID-19"" ‚ÄúL-arginine‚Äù. searches retrieved items. 
 
Added value study 
The first interim analysis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial shows patients hospitalized severe COVID-19 treated L-arginine displayed significantly reduced in-hospital stay vs placebo (log-rank p &lt; ‚Äâ0.0001). Furthermore, 10-day evaluation, 71.1% patients L-arginine group 44.4% placebo group (p &lt; 0.01) reduced respiratory support; however, significant difference detected 20 days randomization, likely participants L-arginine arm already discharged hospital time. 
 
Implications available evidence 
There concrete evidence endothelial dysfunction fundamental feature COVID-19. However, clinical trial actually shown intervention improving endothelial function could beneficial COVID-19. interim findings indicate first time adding L-arginine orally standard therapy patients severe COVID-19 significantly reduces length hospital stay respiratory support.

Essentially hospitalizations winter levels. Deaths still really low per capita. avoidable degree.

Also real change hospitalization rates 12 - suggesting vast majority parents chosen vaccinate kids. Delta far worse winter vaccination keeping up. vaccination reduces risk 10 fold, Delta increases risk 10 fold, would change. sound like 15 dealing parents. Grow up. hit nail head last paragraph. Coronavirus foreseeable future much like flu. evidence current vaccines provide lifetime immunity. think within authority federal government enforce safe workplace regulations? Serious question. Nobody natural immunity. Even contracted covid get again. Chock full it, usually.    1.) I‚Äôm conservative. 2.)

Per article, it‚Äôs $115 vaccinate 150 times hospitalize excluding ICU 300 times. seems reasonable. worse. 

The parents posted social media constantly going public places like bars, also complaining masks vaccine. vulnerable children home. 

It also seems likely parents frequent drug users based social media posts pictures parents (meth signs like rotted teeth).

The child died home. claim got light fever, dead 5 hours later. extremely unlikely went like that. Thankfully, CPS involved investiagtion death. correct answer third part instructing OSHA implement policy

I'm seeing tonight grateful protocols place. get go see show pandemic, amazing comedian (I've seen live watched every special) gives great show.

The venue going requires proof vaccination negative test within past 48 hours; masks required all. two questions

Does anyone know scientific opinion well put together opinion long would take COVID-19 eradicated vaccination? Like different models tested‚Ä¶

My question there‚Äôs authority chimes vaccinated people interact unvaccinated friends. us would like maintain friendships people even though part problem. Winter coming, spending time indoors people inevitable. 

Put another way, way gauge risk hanging unvaccinated people? CDC recommends wearing mask public spaces, doesn‚Äôt really mention anything specific communing unvaccinated friends colleagues etc. seeming still maintain vaccinated people basically conduct selves way pandemic.   You‚Äôll moved another thing Fox told outraged next week  need call national guard. cave psychopathic nut cases.   US health insurance companies cannot discriminate preexisting conditions habits (except smoking). could charge unvaccinated.

There potentially loophole could offer discounts vaxxed otherwise raise premiums, pretty big loophole could lose court battle. (What stop offering non-obesity incentives sterilization incentives?) Yes thats liberty. right pursue happiness ends others begin. getting vaccinated endangers others, reason assault isnt liberty.

That link cdc says 69 per 100k age 0-4. must per 100k population age 0 link must per 100k total population instead 100k age group?

Im mobile need look more. 69 per 100k figure alarming first glance. think need find direct comparison number. It‚Äôs really not, many companies already policy place testing employees every week. It‚Äôs like soaked comment nice sarcastic marinade left long looking can‚Äôt see anything sarcasm. tastes delicious though‚Ä¶ Vaccinations, though, lack conflict like that. reason abortions issue can't agree life starts, one side conflict ""choice."" comparison subject vaccines? ethical uncertainty justifies ""choice"" vaccination?

Good luck finding tests. general medical ignorance consequence ignorant anti-information general. people concept virus mutate potentially become worse, clearly Delta much worse children. There's concept nuance OG strain Delta, whole different ball game everyone including children.

""COVID affect kids,"" I've heard bleat even still Delta wave.  Christian fundamentalists- especially white ones- among likely hostile Protestants white evangelical Protestants remain **least likely** religious groups vaccine accepters (56% groups)"" won‚Äôt lie haven‚Äôt taken offer. Even older guys fully admit covid real threat could kill them. It‚Äôs bit confusing. Obligatory xkcd cartoon :  already required report OSHA employees test positive Covid. Another reason many people refuse testing job would report OSHA anf they'd quarantine 10 days pay. Yeah sure myself, thought right.  fair question unless work need emergency care, know answer can't always trust news. course, hear anecdotal stories, hard know scale not.

Unequivocally, answer ""yes"" ""a lot"". delaying elective procedures like many states right now, impacts enormous. Ask ICU emergency nurse doctor hot spot faring right they'll likely tell worst career experience lives. Common enough common areas low vaccination rates. Exactly. Willingly unvaccinated cut society every possible way Also pretty much 50 states centralized database either, even outlawed using database. know ain‚Äôt happening. can‚Äôt hardly get Covid test days surge going on. daughter young get vaccinated got it. drive 3 pharmacy‚Äôs find rapid home test. BINAX now. go urgent care pediatrician would three day wait. Luckily lost taste snd smell rest us home vaccinated. tested negative multiple times. C'est tres bon! shrewd political move waiting federal unemployment expired, OSHA. Refusing fired means fired cause - unemployment federal protections expired.

People sue, lose, go get vaccinated get decent job, they'll begging money street corner. Communication nothing it‚Äôs mash everything time. Don‚Äôt forget social media works. It‚Äôs giving content thinks want see. Anti-vaxxers feed full anti-vax videos. Yes act almighty feel superior literally doctors believe anti vax crap. actually ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù pushing anti vax conspiracies. Media also loves debate often invite people parties discuss vaccine debate. Also media pushed every single issues vaccines. it‚Äôs straightforward problem people think is. opinion media sick. hate media. They‚Äôve done nothing instigate fear past years. people act scared surprised. Seems like still incentive unless work federal Govt. private business 100 employees, employees option provide weekly tests place vaccine. Thus, still making whatever incentive company vaccine worthwhile - get people vaccinated rather weekly testers. child medically cannot get it? try severe reaction school requires hospital? see lawsuits happening lot. can‚Äôt medically get it, data doctors agree wait. risks outweigh benefits yet. curious, going children removed school? (Strictly talking medically, religiously, whole argument, educated about.)  mean government workers need vaccinated?  agree you, universal scientific consensus personhood begins. enough make blanket claim babies effected. people still argue abortion affects baby therefore say ban justified basis people would use justify vaccine mandates. Oh increment, endpoint. 

Keep mind previously federal employees vaccinate submit testing private employer push. Fast forward couple months that's moved federal employers must vax private employers (100+) must vax test. 

Now larger employers easier get corralled OSHA requirements get started. that's done challenges sorted out, expect next increment employers 75+ 50+ employees. Perhaps testing option removed. next increment come.  it‚Äôs problem don‚Äôt care hits party hard makes lose votes scale. scale, scope, degree employment connected delivering medical services face-to-face capacity.

OSHA mandating vaccinations someone delivering first aid directly another person thing OSHA mandating vaccinations (directly indirectly) someone works home full time without ever going office face-to-face contact. happening takes tip charged federal crime. tips seem pretty common considering outspoken types anti-vaxxers are. Yeah, that's exactly point. There's precedent ""if want business government meet requirements"" (you see time security government work) ""the nature work creates risk"" (you see time special labeling various chemicals required OSHA).

I'm unaware legal precedent authority granted says OSHA require vaccine company 100 employees. anyone point example that?

I've worked healthcare vaccines required totally understand agree them, far know required hospital, OSHA. mean, there's precedent employer requiring vaccines, OSHA requiring vaccines (with employer middle man).

If OSHA saying safety issue (similar wearing hard hat construction site), explain required employers 99 employees, much safety issue?

If matter contracting virus among groups (and group 100 large enough major risk), think they'd use measure like square feet per employee something.

I see good parallel definitely seems challengeable, knows maybe laws creating OSHA something gives power.   Good choice. Get vaccinated take weekly test prove you‚Äôre negative work. Please don‚Äôt shit me, man.  told people USA still get salary form literal paycheck. in, piece paper bring bank get cash bank account credit. dividing total population like number means anything. First 1000 children presently hospitalized total math even remotely relevant would take every child ever hospitalized divide children get relevant number would divide total children tested positive get number would even come close relevant risk assessment. dividing total population gets totally useless number gauge nothing by. don‚Äôt want let anti-vaxxers ruin everything. already taking healthcare system. RIP friends email accounts inviting essential oils parties  think there's also fact many vaccinated people still playing super safe. partner also picked minor breakthrough infections, likely eating cramped restaurant. lot vaccinated folks right now. risk likely varies lot behavior well. trust fart sour stomach data coming Florida probably someone share want data respond with. telling someone they're stupid see clearly nonsense website going change mind. Data probably either, better chance succeeding.  I‚Äôm sorry many kids go hospital many adults pretend pandemic avoid wearing masks, even though vaccinated people still transmit virus. do. People spouting anti-vax rhetoric absolute certainty sheer fervor. People equipped handle bullshit disinformation age living in. 

She's victim. many victims. pawns cynical game. Please tell colleague got fired endagering coworkers reckless way. That's point. saying thing.

Let Earth purge humans. afterlife probably beautiful harmony. perseverance human life frankly embarrassing point. planet want us.   totally get sentiment, feel like that's reasonable.

I grew still live deep south, personally know people, who, feel like never given real chance completely brainwashed literally everyone around extremely conservative. ever one person throughout teen years, really awesome coworker, gave another perspective extreme conservatism. one person help break extreme bias early, knows, may would one idiots raving vaccines. say, everyone deserves second chance man, know life circumstances made way.   Except thats unrealistic, really comes get vax lose job, broke. Im anti Vax thats thinking, anti Vax. know possible repercussions it, mandated. also fear losing job it. Thats I'm saying. first thumbnail looks like lady seemed like drunk giving testimony ""voter fraud"" Michigan Election Hearing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's data outcomes vaccines: still don‚Äôt know long term effects COVID. Even get don‚Äôt end bad symptoms, might still lingering effects years after. district seems much reasonable. child symptoms quarantine symptom-free negative test doctor's note indicating another diagnosis. class quarantine someone positive test. vaccinated kids 12 quarantine unless symptomatic positive test themselves. keeping lot kids school, mean keep son school days cold.  Exactly this, people still wear mask even vaccinated, dunno mask political. wear them, f pandemic. According New York Times, cases currently 5%, hospitalizations leveling (up 1%). 

This would need sustained little sort declaration made current wave subsiding. 

We came holiday weekend, it'll interesting see numbers couple weeks. current wave started 4th July holidays states. Cause Ivermectin new hotness. HDQ old busted. don‚Äôt actually think know snake oils work, want straws grasp at. Generally 200% increase, people start stating terms multiple, instead multiple increase.  would common say something increased tenfold 1000%.  Twofold increase 200%, threefold increase 300%, etc‚Ä¶ Babies affected abortions. can't abort babies. C‚Äôest si bon! Oh right! Oh well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è approved soon that's thing holding parents back, judging say, still enough conspiracy theorist parents convinced. Yea well would categorize disease testing, vaccines, abortions essential medical procedures that, fucking universal healthcare, free available (though I'm aware vaccines testing already free).

I draw line government begins enforcing preventing certain essential medical procedures. worry vaccine mandate government make get medical procedure done damn well stop getting one too. article suffers abbreviation overload. makes comprehension topic discussed difficult. key things article answers question. 

The number antibodies natural infection generally good. However time numbers fall. number antibodies fall re-infected. High levels antibodies older strains also seem offer good resistance newer strains like Delta. However lower levels antibodies offer limited protection re-infection likely. literally numbers game. (Antibody) responses vaccination individuals previously infected SARS-CoV-2 potent, higher level achieved two vaccine doses.¬†

This indicates 2 things. 

The immune systems response natural infection vaccines similar enough complimentary.  

Second getting shot even infected good idea. ensure enough antibodies fend new strains. 

This reason shots even though pretty sure contracted virus testing available (very sore lungs cough 2 months). Gotta keep antibody numbers getting Covid hurts like hell. 15 minutes pharmacy road worth it. Yeah polio, measles, smallpox went away natural immunity /s. Like come dude tons examples vaccines basically eradicated disease modern society access it. underlying point misses fact people often hypocrites cowards. Fuck. second one feeling pretty bad. Hopefully lasts couple days get booster day weekend. schools send students get tested symptomatic, nothing done actual schools, parents still send kids school sick! know state , , Texas state knows whether got vaccinated .  bleach also kill petri dish?

Wait, no! Stop drinking bleach! Aw shit....not again. federal employees included.  back original question. Who's going enforce this? Unless OSHA hires 25,000 new temporary employees check safeguards used unenforceable mass scale.

Now shifting vaccine mandates, consider least putting together exit strategy masks part? They‚Äôve around year half point. dum dums can‚Äôt even get scaremongering factoids correct. numbers seen vaccines effective delta something like 10-20% less mild illness. still contagious mild illness unlikely become severe vaccinated. also evidence effectiveness declines 10-20% 6 months, primarily mild illness, far evidence declines that. furor study currently. One theory continues decline, another theory stabilizes, third theory protection actually increases 6 months.

When delta variant first discovered bunch studies found vaccines still effective it, point vaccine manufacturers pursue developing vaccine specifically variant. Bottom line me, vaccine effective known variants.  Well, least avoids issue fake vaccine cards.

Qui coupe le fromage? accept it. part trials screwed. Source: screwed carry paper copy. Hey, least soldiers vaccinated. anti-vaxxers, vulnerable. Let‚Äôs see fare trenches, completely unvaccinated. kid, kid, seem like flawed premise rally around several pretty obvious reasons, basically mentioned somewhere thread. 
I think one major overlooked problems here, definitely continuing reasons vaccinate populace. happens next virus slightly deadlier. high think mortality rate would majority people refusing get vaccinated capitulate? Imagine significant chunk society hardens resolve get vaccinated ever, next virus mortality rate say 15%? scenario setting self for, that‚Äôs scenario would really change ability remain self determinate possible. Side note : can't stand shit people saying unconstitutional blah blah Honestly constitution probably guidelines could help end pandemic. medical issue, civil liberties/consitutional one like many trying make it. Based. thought hospitalization rate % confirmed infections? Delta (or another variable) driving severe illness % stay steady? case increased spread, we'd expect increased numbers hospitalized toddlers change % confirmed cases go hospital. sake ours. boyfriend's elderly mom hospital covid. vaccinated still quite sick. large family devoted her.

The thought amazing woman dying alone makes furious scared. way. ‚òùÔ∏èthis fully vaccinated reason even wear mask public unless mandate. scared vaccinated? I‚Äôm sure people still arguing review don‚Äôt think understand viscerally terrifying needle phobia be. got Pfizer available time, filled dread entire time going vax site. Many people straight faint needle goes (vasovagal reaction). Hell, uncle literal surgeon still hard time getting blood drawn. covid issue live mate. backed here, rare county. yeah, id bet people vaccinated, would cause issues. Almost like everyone lives place. using number gauge hospital capacity also determined beds per 100k population. Nowhere say estimate risk Also France **socialist** got shots Walmart QR code. Check wherever got shots from.   It‚Äôs interesting. sit writing pretty bad breakthrough case. Attended indoor wedding past Sunday. 

What‚Äôs peculiar number young, healthy vaccinated people coming COVID one event. can‚Äôt quite figure caused high number breakthrough cases data seems tell us otherwise (1 10,000 compared 10-30 150). I‚Äôd say us fully vaccinated beginning May. 

I‚Äôm supportive ending restrictions getting people vaccinated say experience made scratch head bit. not. supported 100 years supreme court precedent. Mandating vaccine public health violation constitutional rights period.  inclusive federal employees, contracted workers?  Imo even enough. tons company offices nearly 100 people working close proximity affected dont hit correct limit people. States offered that, definitely take time read anything.

That last thing mentioned also stick carrot. instead increase amount vaccination mandates %s vaccinated actually goes up. I'm done goodbye flu exist last winter, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre about.  Whoa whoa whoa. Israel giving high risk 5-12 yr olds vaccine since July?!?! Anyone knows what‚Äôs data that? many kids got shot known adverse events?! I‚Äôm one glad Israel like big open experiment get live data feedback.  You‚Äôre adding context original comment simply stated still get spread it. list percentages whatsoever. point valid there‚Äôs points argued there. simply made silly comment reply whatever reason found info typed. problem schools requiring vaccinations. want kids get vaccinated, go school there. Yeah idk you‚Äôve seen I‚Äôd like read links extent pandemic ""straining healthcare resources""? people actually dying/being harmed can't access hospitals/medical care? many people? Testing remains long pole.  vaccine candidates going effective enough worth rolling out.  fraction vaccine candidates going unacceptable levels adverse effects.  there's weird stuff turns -- instance, look limits get recently approved Dengue vaccine.

And there's question dose optimization: using highest tolerable dose likely protect everyone gets it, smaller dose stops pandemic quickly vaccinate 3x 4x many people quantity vaccine?  Trials least explore space give policymakers choices.. Dude‚Ä¶and you‚Äôre willing put authoritarian bs? nice   OSHA jurisdiction state, county local employees. Therefore, regulation would apply you.   big win. five year old started school I'm freaking out. Fortunately, school requires mask teachers students. Look ‚Äúmagic mouthwash‚Äù mouth blisters gets them. It‚Äôs mix Benedryl Maalox, friends babies awful mouth sores HFM said thing soothed enough get eat drink. Check pediatrician course, think it‚Äôs pretty common treatment pedis recommend. might truth since mother shares antibodies baby. would interesting see antibody test baby. mean maddow? he‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôll summarize points you: ‚ÄúCommunistic‚Äù also keep mind may vast tracts inexpensive property hitting market next years. primarily rural zones ... time get cabin always wanted!  Good know really trending see enough trend line. using selected short term (7 days). coming national holiday, close crowded *outdoor* sporting events full swing. would expect trust numbers, circumstances, minimum, 30 days old.  Find what? happen 80 million still refuse? continue ‚Äúfuck around‚Äù. ‚Äúfind out‚Äù president?    Clickbait title.   people don‚Äôt want vaccinate? Point taken :) kids. Still great news. guess that's true, whole career tech gonna assume rest world inept industry. Thank goodness doctors programmers. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre ok! It‚Äôs reminder even relatively safe bubble Cambridge still real! It‚Äôs hard type fingers crossed :)   suggest 80 million people want inject something body?  abortion affects one outside yourself. getting vaccinated affects around some. even close thing lol. last checked, still freedom's decide get vaccinated. lose lot privileges choose to. abortion comparison asinine. Well I'm surprised ffs, can't use 1 bed apiece like rest us? going inforce Flu shots well? That‚Äôs insane. 

Vaccinated people problem.  wife ICU nurse. mean tell guys 25% healthcare workers deal idiot vaccine deniers still don‚Äôt want vaccine? 

The solution seems simple. Like Vietnam everyone ok saw live feeds war suffering. 

Figure privacy laws show videos multitude dying idiots. scare rest idiots.

Meanwhile wife continue get $5000-$8000 week offers.  mom love make fun anti vaxxers Facebook feed. God they‚Äôre dumb. Right how?   Yeah, it‚Äôs easy. started 100lbs ago, wouldn‚Äôt daunting losing 100lbs. People generally overweight don‚Äôt willpower change unhealthy behavior, consequences. I'm sure agree logic take anti vaccine rhetoric not, everyone get vaccine.

Yes places like schools require vaccinated attend, that's completely different position mandate.

This mandate government forcing companies require vaccines (or test) simply existing. That's lot different forcing companies want government service requiring vaccines. 

No idea constitutional pretend expert this, comparison schools government contractors really valid comparison. Yes ""Biden also signing executive order require vaccination employees executive branch contractors business federal government""

The morning last speech federal contractors, federal contractors got memo saying they're getting time get vaccine effects.  guess get written follow EO.

nice. consequence unvaccinated? 80 million people choose inject? Thanks, aware WFH option; link information regarding available exemptions? gotten control guys applauding it. 99.9% survival rate Liberty cost? Till point virus kills half population? ‚Äúliberty‚Äù need controlled good neighbor? Showing someone piece paper nothing like getting felt cop, that's ridiculous comparison make. Im really pissed Dr. Mike youtube right now.  


Vaccine hesitancy main cause current covid outbreak do? Makes video interviews somebody unfortunately severe breakthrough case biggest takeaway video ""dont think protected Delta vaccinated. Go back 2020 stay home living) I'm like fucking kidding me? video going seen admission vaccine work already comments see anti-vaxxers celebrating ""proven right"" 


The chance landing hospital breakthrough case still astronomically low comparison vaccinated. Look doctors overwhelmed ICUs saying ONE patient they're treating vaccinated. single one. Fuck 'em. focus want less effectiveness dealing infection extent transmission.

For example skew hospitalisation/death heavy towards age/obesity/prior health conditions even amongst vaccinated next determining factor vulnerable becoming infected.

So important know transmissible virus vaccinated unvaccinated much exposure actually needed cause breakthrough infection. potentially time. 

For example assuming virus go extinct, even population 100% vaccinated. different would extent breakthrough cases say 80% population vaccinated. (Similar now)

And obviously Delta, factoring new variants time.  Good. unvaccinated banned international travel every country. Losing weight easy wanting to, else one would overweight. lot sustained work, especially lot stuff going saps mental willpower. That‚Äôs awful lot removing Bot. tent. previous company object coverage even quit. do, coverage.  mean... national emergency.. exercise powers. Big ol‚Äô oof. Good luck ya ü§∑ question override unions signed contracts vaccines optional? I‚Äôm nurse blows mind nurses opt vaccines union decided push agenda (we actually voting right new union current one gone rails) That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôd agree that. sure don‚Äôt sufficient data either country, could wrong. main point I‚Äôd like argue it‚Äôs soon declare victory summer, declaring victory something winter season, before. numbers 40 400 per 100,000, since percentages alone tell nothing unlikely stop people trying use excuse. quitting cases. unemployment.    Hospital census declining. That's pretty rock solid evidence we've passed peak. I'm curious new mandate go effect workplace. work local town government. employ 100+ split departments (FD, PD, Town Hall, etc) would still require us required get it? offices 3 9 people given point.

AND FUCKING RIGHT possible distribution vaccination uptake evenly spread population there? I‚Äôm Canada one issue province (BC) though overall numbers look good, they‚Äôre bit misleading focus on. regions high vaccination others low. Averaging together, things look right, remove restrictions, covid takes neighbourhoods/populations lower rates. 

Since people aren‚Äôt vaccinated tend live regions, sharing mindsets visiting public spaces, hospitals regions get overwhelmed. people aren‚Äôt vaccinated also tend ‚Äúcovid over‚Äù people immediately race back pre-restrictions behaviour well, fair number vaccinated people seemed little cautious even things ‚Äúallowed‚Äù hospitals unable function, lockdowns pointless. Vaccines great all, they're going help hospitals lot slower lockdowns. 2 week lockdown + vaccine requirements go public areas lockdown would pretty useful. People got vaccinated already punished able get medical care unrelated things covid19 they're unfortunately enough serious breakthrough case. best lie put random casual volunteering something like ""ooo look totally thing, yep I'm good capitalist bee, look me"" Yay! billions Pfizer/Moderna!

The guy that's vaccinated Covid-19 problem comes Covid-19. *can* still get virus, mean getting vaccinated. That's total horseshit proposition. Maybe could try critical thinking going about?

You know sound like? Like fake fuck. Like one racists like ""hey got black friends"" one guy Steam's friends list black guy avatar shit. Absolutely fakery.

Nobody thought topic clarity could possibly come conclusion sides even remotely here. That's stupid.

That said feel little sticky companies could WFH environment. started new job months ago I've still never met single coworker manager. might never meet them. Feels strange could require never physically seeing me. could see requiring ever required go back office. 

Ultimately hopefully amazing boost vaccination rate I'm playing little devils advocate.

Have actually asked unvaccinated people large survey they‚Äôre unvaccinated? reasonable excuses there. mean think everyone get vaccinated I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre little dramatic unfair. Data seems par know far; 600 breakthrough cases per day / 4500 per week, keep mind that's 4.5M vaccinated total.

At least shows breakthrough cases increasing, one (few) states track breakthrough. Unsure whether delta protection rapidly dropping time.

Gotta ramp vaccines Nigeria, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Indonesia Mexico...  work unless draconian one including many vaccinated stand it.  really help much though.

You wacko antivaxer say ""man antivaxxers mad, maybe couold right? seem little wacky, knows?"" delay long enough get fucked.

There's also secondary lesson of... listen crazy people. nearly high Denmark every couple percentage actually makes good sized difference Congress pass law though. passed 1970 Richard Nixon signed law. law established OSHA empowered create enforce workplace health safety regulations. 

It doesn‚Äôt seem like OSHA‚Äôs getting outside lane created Congress this. doesn‚Äôt government mandate *other* vaccines?

There's literally huge carve anyone claims medical exemption masks. even mention nobody following checking masks office enforcing rule. show. Agreed. We‚Äôve school whole time we‚Äôre trade school. can‚Äôt teach plumbing remotely. masks we‚Äôve stayed pretty healthy. sick deaths far. Hey man, I'm bashing you, one personal anecdote value. 'return norm' (you getting better anyway) placebo effect, two things bias account. need study trial.

You say 'if help then...'. Totally agree. help, use it. shows possible signs helping, study it. exactly that, hundreds studies currently.

But sadly, evidnefe looking good. randomised control trials (meaning accounting biases mentioned above), looks like shows difference placebo.

So although taking normal dose hurt you, probably help either. Problem leads bad health choices people believe treatment effective isn't, example taking effective vaccine. exactly anti vax movement love nothing unproven miracle cure, always have, always will. latest one. 

We know sure yet, looks likely ivermectin help you. whole debacle (along invented therapies) likely lead hundreds, thousands, maybe even hundreds thousand preventable deaths vaccine hesistamr! got open enrollment notification October, cannot wait see Covid shot. OSHA basically nothing inspecting small businesses employee complains badly injured killed. baguette fuck here
-French person. Good understand coming from, also frustrated anti-vax movement. Devil's advocate, though, making assumptions here: Many people basing decision information they've received, however misguided may be. Others acting based anecdotal outcomes family members loved ones. think vast majority making decision ""be douche"", someone credible swayed them. Whether former president Trump, various governors/senators, Uncle Bob Aunt Sue, I'd like think people trying maliciously spread potentially kill others refusing vaccine.

I propose bigger problem 1) people getting information, 2) people spreading misinformation? still boggles mind wearing masks became politicized. Like, places require shoes entry. everyone likes wearing shoes, anyways. way masks. like ""big mask"" pushing big-mask agenda us. thoughts hoax long gone can't fake literally millions corpses across entire world. understand hesitancy taking 'experimental' vaccine fully-cleared studied years typically are, personal take there's probably what, billion shots arms across world right now? Zero zombies far. Aside Doctor prescribed based seeing positive results treating multiple patients, you‚Äôre right, first hand experience / anecdotal evidence. Yet one reason love France!     happen back early 2020. working advanced newer/effective versions vaccine need make profit first magically happens 12th birthday make safe effective day before? Haha kind thing common makes (native English speaker EU) think there's something unique many people using english second language.  Well plenty well anti-vaxxers, though they're probably types expect entire world treat Americans gods speak English cry US embassy ever feel violated. Like, want argue ""The numbers say good things trust stay way. think something worse come along, like new variant,"" least makes sense. Instead, arguing good numbers actually bad numbers, make sense.  France supported united states Iraq. wasnt enough support said ""fuckem"" Idk read article studies, careful making statements like have. antibodies article states cannot say whether level antibodies correlates effectiveness. articles suggesting Moderna effective gone peer review. 

Not trying rude, cannot make assertion made yet. dog poop. proud herself. Thisssss Gotcha. Thanks I'm going take guess say Americans refuse vaccine probably travel France anyway. Thank well sourced comment. 

The ‚Äúselfish prick‚Äù thing irritated lashing out. need breathe sometimes‚Ä¶ link know study Nigeria. they're using anti-parasitic drug. developed symptoms Wednesday. Today rapid test PCR. Rapid test negative feel like death. can't imagine covid. I'm coughing temp slightly elevated, think flu. I've never illness like this.

I'm fully vaccinated. Can't imagine bad would wasn't. diamonds red cards red cards diamonds. There's much precedent - example, lot countries Africa South America already compulsory yellow fever vaccination requirements. certificate, entry. fine. go. I‚Äôm guessing late October  anyone else covid nose bleeds? something worry need continue ride out? speculation top speculation top speculation would happen said , hey listened Joe Rogan alex Jones took ivermectin?? studies mechanism action discussed quite lot detail, particularly relation novel coronavirus. read, Ivermectin interaction ACE-2 receptors, would probably need scientist fully understand mechanism action.

This obviously proof works treatment, without proof would never approved use specifically treat covid, inferences made works potential effectiveness.

Critics studies conclude scientific theory sound, dosing levels likely required effective would far exceed safe amounts humans, mention total lack clinical trials would provide meaningful data could used analysis.

A reasonable lay-person's assessment Ivermectin experimental unapproved treating covid, continue investigated based historical importance treating conditions. classify conspiracy write ""dewormer"" ignoring lot context surrounding it, claim cure even effective equally dishonest.

We're talking insurance premiums, we're talking simply going outside...you move Australia totalitarian insanity anti vaxers people go France complain loudly one speaks English. don‚Äôt think France miss them. main barrier right really cost. Yea, make doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean everyone able access them. Well...

I'm fully vaccinated since early May. drove Arizona California take care grandma days (fully vaccinated since February) parents, fully vaccinated since June, fly Denver meet one business suppliers rock, gem &amp; mineral show. 

I'd lying said bit nervous two breakthrough bringing home grandma could take back Arizona give wife, also fully vaxxed since February. Since beginning covid I've always looked pregnant women thought incredibly stressful difficult time must pregnant! Yep. scientists never said 100% efficacious, lazy journalists politicians agenda. ever percentage. Pfizer 90% effective serious illness. Astrazeneca beta like 50%, leading South Africa (beta SA variant) selling AZ shots. knew already. yes quite right, partially efficacious currently.

This time next year may 0 efficacious 99% efficacious depending variants tech developments! I‚Äôm sure depends. I‚Äôve heard Canadian family coming US surgery weight times. I‚Äôve also waited certain procedures long periods time. There‚Äôs great way this.


I don‚Äôt think US going socialized healthcare better now. many little things would make huge difference. picture vaccinated going public would happen? 

How would enforced? country succesful example vaccines working? Israel cases spiking unfortunately used arguments anti-vaxx people. Uhhh...

Again we've before. We've plenty vaccines require boosters. Standard kids ones require boosters. Tetanus one requires boosters.

Flu vaccines never 100% effective either.

Pfizer applies (hopefully late September they've said), I've read could anywhere end October early December. simply depend long takes FDA look everything give approval. hope time used get everything place shots start administered immediately.

Well, already do. 

No one told do. given choice: 

Do bare minimum protect society barred participating society. 


People already required get vaccinations jobs, school, even travel. entitled plague rat. 

Being hesitant towards vaccine means victim misinformation. like fucking zombie outbreak people. hear one piece bullshit spread it. 


Stop. stop. settled generations petulance detriment community.  Lol. I'm OP. Anyone refuses vaccine non-medical reasons selfish plague rat. Maybe Roux bottle, used grow animal cells viral replication. wonder compare time United Airline's concept putting people get exemptions unpaid leave they're vaccinated.   one willingly unvaccinated point never planning going France anyway. thought going couple weeks?

That's somewhat promising. hope Dems move bonkers new laws instead galvanized going '22. almost 30% healthcare workers aren‚Äôt vaxxed forcing get vax aren‚Äôt comfortable year half burnout‚Ä¶

They already taken **mandatory** vaccinations work job have. pre-COVID. 

This vaccine pandemic *is burning out*. 

If want take it, betraying profession, ethos, education. choosing leave position. also opt religious reasons many places, personal experience, didn‚Äôt even make didn‚Äôt want to.



If *any* vaccination, able opt-out religious reasons. 

If decide take vaccine religious reasons, get participate society. get endanger others sayin, understand it, forcing anyone something fucked up.

No one forced. choosing leave job decision. 

Again, already taken vaccines mandated education profession. 

If bare minimum *protect* society, get participate society. 


Choices consequences. 3 feet actually one meter. baguette usually around 46cm 60cm (source: Google), fine two baguettes. 

If eat second one, still safe slicing remaining one half. thank thats kindest comment. Yeah dont option keep home currently, work full time jobs demanding/hectic. either job would suffer child would suffer. right, know we're best circumstances we're given. seen info American get EU vaccine passport even possible? think people would board stated goal committed to. Ie ""We want lockdown accomplish X."" one articulate specific defined goal, trust politicians stick plan without goal posts moving. people vaccinated cases down, kicking problem road. thing many people trust media experts who're proclaiming vaccine safe effective.

They even believe Trump said too. Sure, still ability say no... obese person... you... let's treat unvaxxed like smokers, allowed certain areas, higher premiums, lower transplant list etc.. Two ladies eyes closed. hate see it. Probably queueing tests, vaccinated daily vax numbers highest small queues. Yeah new administration simply brilliant. mental healthcare also use cash cases still rising. Daily deaths new cases still rising. seeing peak, weather gets colder fall don‚Äôt expect peak. haha yes mean bubble boy! protect much. We're fully vaxxed fully vaxxed people allowed around but, much he's bigger environment like daycare. qr code cd screenshotted, right? heard something like happened nightclub netherlands don‚Äôt protect variants

This false. 3 month old still essentially sheltered place - leaving go store park.

It's terrifying even vaccinated infected person could get son sick. We're waiting he's vaccine eligible cases fall dramatically. existing contracts, there's lot could do. could incentives, usually baked plan year. Employers lot flexibility.  also mandate exercise calorie restriction obese people also same? smokers? think Desantis thinks far ahead I'm going fight greeter grocery store random bartender, stop requiring masks I'm going anywhere requests them. There's FDA approved method preventing cancer genetic diseases type 1 diabetes, etc. *are* FDA approved vaccines preventing covid least preventing hospitalizations due covid. choose get vaccine much likely go hospital makes sense rate go up. choice take risk.

If smoker made unhealthy choice makes sense pay insurance. choose get vaccine ideological reasons, going bigger burden healthcare system pay more. complicated. I'd love that. I've J&amp;J, getting close flu shot time. could knock one visit, would nice. not, whatever, I'll get two shots boosters roll out. news, freedom fries back menu! interesting conversation brother wife recently. judgement here, observation. People talking alot 9/11 20yr anniversary coming up. devastating loss change life many us hearing hurt talk it, still feels raw sometimes... alot people speak devastatingly it, people disregarding covid. people willing abandon freedoms, give whatever asked name killing bad guys (and countless bystanders), people ardently opposed mask vaccine mandates name saving hundreds thousands, millions, lives. just... sad I'm honest. crazies influential way infecting people's brains done significant, long lasting harm country.  regulation yet ‚Äî probably need wait weeks details ""Or require weekly testing."" Next. Biden said speech people dying less year better last year. guess really want another lock winter he's preparing us it? make sense know, like precedent. Mate R 8 vaccine efficacy 70% preventing cases. absolutely way eradicate it.

I'm pretty sure they've said even got 0 cases complete lockdown whole world would jump back animal human many different animals it.

Even there's new variants get long term immunity it, catch variant multiple times. Supreme Court precedent mandating vaccine would PPE. thick you? 
1) think get antibody test. 
2) data taker adds +1 
3) repeats
4) get card says antibodies like vaccine card. Boom üí• wow mind blown. 

I now, ever , asking rerun all
Numbers include them. asking doctors aren‚Äôt pharma claiming still get vaccine pointless not. 

What study needs take place start including recovered vaccinated column. You‚Äôve totally different argument entire time . tests besides antibody test? goes back smallpox survived immunity robust. It‚Äôs already agreed they‚Äôre protected, ideal statical analysis new clinical trial think accomplished ALREADY recovered. people commenting don‚Äôt understand short staffed hospitals already. dropping 25% nurses likely result death didn‚Äôt get vaccine. 

Travel nurses can‚Äôt fill gaps everywhere. too. frustrated crap.

What research? looking online long take? Creating vaccine took less time.   ‚ÄúThe average ER wait time United States 40 minutes. 22 million ER visits ‚Äî 16 percent visits ‚Äî involved hour waiting 2017, recent year tabulated Centers Disease Control Prevention‚Äù

This result quick google pretty standard us normally‚Ä¶ bad day normal circumstances 3+ hours worst days maybe 4-5hours‚Ä¶. mention relatively small,surgically oriented hospital area‚Ä¶ ER full means larger trauma centers area diversion fir quite sometime work NY hospital (so mandate coming less 3 weeks) we're losing 1/3rd department governor back down. 

It's funny though, anti-vaxxers helpdesk/desktop support positions - rest us higher required education vaxxed... liberal universities must brainwashed us injecting poison ourselves! can‚Äôt instead give shot hundreds thousands coming country spreading virus? high percentage testing positive aren‚Äôt testing everyone‚Ä¶   market quit job likely find another one pays better matter weeks, issue place also likely vaccine mandate.

My entire team vaccinated since March though.  Yes   think would make huge difference. 5-11 year olds lots contact peers. would assume kids 5 probably much smaller social circle e.g. day cares tend small usually group kids. would foresee that? Where's precedent? many presidents mandated vaccines  They‚Äôre majority republicans. They‚Äôll think something. believe bad move Biden ask me. He‚Äôs basically taking everyones right think make decisions. Granted vaccination needs happen. way. Nurses perfect example of, ""a little bit information dangerous thing."" 

Most 6 month certificates 2 year community College degrees think knowledge equals doctors research scientists. 70%+ 12+ pretty different 70%+ individuals comes lowering R 1. 

Furthermore, often act like vaccines evenly/randomly distributed population, reality groups far higher rates groups far lower rates. non homogenous distribution allows outbreaks among lower vaccinated rate individuals.

Additionally, Canada far lower total case count point, presumably lower rate natural immunity augmenting vaccination program. Accepting limitations case reporting... Denmark reported ~60,000 cases per million pop, Canada reported ~40,000. Admittedly numbers 6% 4% respectively, probably multiple groundtruth given testing limitations especially early on.

The main issues come mind grounded data ... Beyond free speculate health differences, rates interaction despite restrictions, prominence certain variants etc. can't help wonder ERs horribly inefficient. Think it. 

Get triaged right away (usually). 

Then wait course - really long time usually.

Then go back. Wait more.

Then finally seen SOMEONE.  H&amp;P usually lasts 5 minutes tops.

Then order tests. Wait more. 

Then want Xray CT.  Wait more.

Then get dx nearly always first guess H&amp;P

THen wait more.

Then fill Rx discharge. 

What instead like this:

I'm confused president authority mandate private companies make employees get vaccines came masks, Biden said authority mandate non-federally controlled spaces. similar rules? one dose acceptable mandates?

This model school districts adopt.  vacinnated since April, want know plays boosters. vaccine mandates 2 shot cycle, logically mean future boosters next year also mandated? 

Also thrilled future presidents 10 years use mandated vaccines inappropriately. Could well former lobbyist pharm. exactly American tradition elect best become President.  Seems many find way circumvent mandate.

A $14k fine per violation makes seem like companies going comply.  Right, hospital systems (reportedly) strained. can't keep health care workers. Almost people hospital vaccinated.    Would even get unemployment quitting own? Bunch coworkers said thing.

Pisses off. I‚Äôll answer point three you: absolutely constitutional.  source jobs small companies also share antivaxxers view. Probably limited.

UK base decision currently widespread delta variant? seem hitting kids harder (not necessarily severity cohort number infections transmitted) US early covid.

Kids risk severe disease lower adults - spread disease quite effectively especially unfortunately large percentage unvaccinated adults. ver many American adults significant comorbidities.

Come think it, lot kids covid comorbidities - 20% obese, around 10% asthma.

The risks vaccine low, vaccinated kids lot less likely infect others.   Agreed. approaching point testing requirement keep jobs. make pay weekly test. 


Once start spending money, may inclined get shot.   info hospitalizations covid recovered? ie... got covid, recovered got covid worse ended hospital? stats that?  seems little late this?

I'm saying, underestimate deeply illogical stubborn. also already state vaccine mandates 1905 earlier.

[And supreme court made start selling Thrive.  see reason mandate limited businesses one hundred employees. 

As sounds like enforced OSHA, regulations apply businesses ten employees. 

If based location number employees, many bars restaurants exempt.

Seems many find way around mandate.  ErMerDerna  Must...have...video... oppose vaccinated.    Yeah supreme court already ruled vaccine mandates past.

[deciding times struggle common good outweighs personal liberties making mean like literally vaccines required go school? People think keep running forever. company (small, 20 employees) already three people quit covid restrictions far, *far* much lenient this. They're gonna jobless, fucked unemployment long. Seems kind silly healthcare workers unvaccinated. everybody sudden become public health experts?

We need Nike take vaccination campaign‚Ä¶ IT! Fantastic. leadership.  **OSHA entered chat.** England mostly back normal really frustrates media. Lol! Vaccine mandates around century. going throw temper tantrum, least take minute learn history.

Listen I‚Äôm vaccines, it‚Äôs people want not. I‚Äôm force it‚Äôs body choice anymore. 

And hospitals aren‚Äôt turning people away stop regurgitating political media talking points. 

There‚Äôs many nurses doctors haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine forced literally decided it‚Äôs best quit take vaccine. 

And it‚Äôs legal country constitution. Biden make whatever mandates wants courts take away. one enforce it. 

It‚Äôs amazing think since you‚Äôre democrat answers go along. Don‚Äôt ask questions fine you‚Äôre told. Meanwhile ignore tell keep changing it. Stay bubble guess like. yeah keep ignoring ur party told keep ignoring keep changing it. takes years get case Supreme Court, get basically want point conservative hence lower vaccination rate government incompetent there

It's amazing see much seriously pandemic taken Canada. According [the 70.4% 12+ population Alberta fully vaccinated. US, [according 63% 12+ population fully vaccinated. 

And Alberta conservative province lowest vaccination rate. think Doug Ford actually willing lock (everyone US gave long time ago). Crazy. Sympathy schmucks getting real low.

We're far, far, far, far worse *Idiocracy*. We're literally failing society, country, *species*, right eyes. Dude def die I'm baffled healthcare professional *in middle pandemic* would refuse vaccine **when they're witnessing people virus daily**. think line kind gotcha? took 8 plus months research vaccine seen data affects unvaccinated compared vaccinated? Seems like new famous last words days. ""I vaccinated""   What's ""everything fine"" rate? binary outcome. either ""asymptomatic"" ""dead"".

The people suffering long term issues probably wished they'd shot. people spent weeks hospital face fallout probably wish they'd shot.

""You die"" convincing argument let cut finger. There's 100 years legal precedent U.S.  something grows exponentially shrug off, butt fucks weeks later.

There‚Äôs people talking October lockdown necessary UK it‚Äôs believable. 5-4 decisions, must really difficult interpret. already pretty much everything else still large number employees wfh office mandated wear masks, no. think might also something Israel essentially phase 4 clinical Pfizer trial. pretty much country-scale statistical investigation Pfizer vaccine. trove data exist places.

Florida bad ridiculous number people pretending months.

There's game TV right packed stadium worse numbers virtually every metric compared past peaks.

So yeah.. we're tropical maybe plays factor. 

But there's way fuckery going parts.  Ask boss. That‚Äôs good memory, best remember Blood borne standard, employer required make hep b vaccine available employees employees decline waive protections.

Let children. think politicization court works one way though (which one problems it). case strong check.  arguing someone gloats they‚Äôre fully vaccinated Reddit.

They‚Äôre requiring something way hasn‚Äôt required till now. completely useless waste time tested every week. Also, hope it‚Äôs company time they‚Äôre ones requiring it. Funny you‚Äôre ok government making decisions people. stand behind it. something disagree you‚Äôd thinking quite different     employers 100 required get weekly testing (with exception given people fully vaccinated). federal employees funded government mandated get vaccine; testing exception think?  hope you‚Äôre right, don‚Äôt trust Supreme Court. century ago, Supreme Court think so. Plus availability vaccines. mention increased demand due booster already vaccinated. one tell $300 week unemployment benefits they‚Äôve complaining ended days ago. ""protect serve (except mildly inconvenient)"" even though folks vaccinated carry, spread still get sick covid...thats OK long vaccination card? negative test? 
Ultimately means long vaxed positive one cares? Correct I'm wrong...

Shouldnt negative test required vs either/or thing..? Negative negative someone card matter negative positive? get?

That‚Äôs purpose Supreme Court. soul purpose Supreme Court interpret constitution United States.   Anti vaxxers cowards afraid nonexistent long term side hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlong term‚Äù You‚Äôre talking side effects.

...Yes. were. There's 100 years legal precedent U.S. valid medical reasons? Maybe allergy ingredient...? beyond that, would valid medical reason get written off?

Note: also understand conditions could cause temporary reason exempt (maybe like active cancer treatment??? Idk I'm doctor). beyond that, would permanent legitimate medical exemption reasons be? Exactly. fucking rules? anyone link OSHA policy private companies? Sounds like might soon. Yeah I've delaying children's well child dental appointments going year now. Unless need required vaccine shots, I'll keep home now. won‚Äôt, did, shouldn‚Äôt working healthcare anyway. might bit optimistic... nepotism still exists.  country's founding tenets ""freedom selfish asshole global crisis, either."" possible way vaccine shed viruses live viruses vaccine. shedding baloney comes vaccine used 50s issue.

For fucking what? sore arm?  Ventilator play hot right now! Interesting article cites Pfizer out-performing Moderna (even marginally). Everything I've reading lately saying quite opposite??    could see going either way it. Stopping pandemic pro-business they're re-election play short-term culture war nonsense. OTOH, they'd probably love get rid OSHA altogether, get back workers losing limbs life without company liability. Supreme Court never ruled masks.

They ruled favor mandatory vaccines.  I‚Äôm audio engineer full time production technician. industry opened back regardless shows events there. freelance different venues along many audio lighting techs, touring main source income. national touring acts hiring technicians yet it‚Äôs still touch go whether winter going motor repeat last winter.

Vaccines currently required like stated long track records prior becoming mandated. 

This exact mentality applies lot consumer world. lock-downs half-assed poorly thought through.

A strategy 'flatten curve' means disease around require vaccination. strategy elimination via effective quarantining would eliminated disease US within months. 

Sadly, US government lacks organizational skill pull off, US populace lacks discipline sense civil duty comply effective voluntary quarantining.

Also, adopting strategy flattening curve guarantees need vaccines, profits well-connected pharmaceutical med-tech companies. US government corrupt enough expect least leadership swayed consideration. state mandated, state funded. SB 95 says employers provide 80 hours supplemental paid sick leave covid related illness. Employers try apply tax breaks compensate cost. OK mate, seriously asking, non American, nutshell: can't long term studies mrna vaccines used anger before, however emerging tech last two decades well understood.

1) true forbade work, alternative, weekly test is, least, expensive, also somewhat intrusive. 100 million workers huge portion total. case, ""forbidden"" work sense always work waiters small business minimum wage, make exact hypothetical requirement % populations hate its, yet chaos you‚Äôre describing ensued

The main aspect would possession marijuana personal use. rule high percentage people agree, many people use marijuana individual level. arguably true create havoc: big cause black communities ended disrupted enjailment many black men. would say drug criminalization (Nixon's law) great role 80s perpetuating black people separate caste. part government forcing vaccinate ""unregulated capitalism,"" excuse me? Finally, leadership. missed much details, apply company multiple facilities usually around 20 30 employees per site? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* cult? Omg y'all seriously obsessed guy. mean understandable tho, compared old senile puppet white house day night difference need EU citizen, negative test go EU. Americans can't go anymore September think Novavax‚Äôs too. Lol maybe hypothetical situation needed convince conservatives universal healthcare needed Funny empathetic people certain political leanings jumping joy people losing jobs unable collect unemployment. always game. wonder would go government mandated BMI tests weekly made people lose jobs bought Cheetos. 

inb4""obesity contagious"" vaccines masks protect bud covid contagious obesity play right choice affects you, fine. choice gets people killed, cool. Jesus Crust pizza. Employers going fire workers can't replace (10 million unfilled jobs) matter mandate freedom killed actions someone else. mandates increase freedoms decrease them. fact can‚Äôt see embarrassing.  Pardon ignorance, thought Texans (at least conservative Texans) liked Cruz? happened flight attendant, I‚Äôve waiting on. workplace mandate isn‚Äôt helpful high-risk ass thousands customers share metal tube zero restrictions. also allow employers dismiss employees don‚Äôt lose weight? used term ""unregulated capitalism"" again, literally right speaking government forcing business fire receiving vaccine. 

Now ask this. even phrase mean, speaking topics know little about? First, OSHA mandated vaccines before. example anyone administers first aid may come contact blood hepatitis b vaccine. top that, OSHA even mandating vaccine. mandating testing vaccine granting exemption said testing. CoVidiFlu  differ workplace safety regulations? also employers decide whether workers protected fires, hazardous chemicals unsafe drinking water? OSHA rules workers right safe workplace. First get talking points Fox news tonight. know Jesus personally founded United States 2000 years ago? Millions people dead gross overreach. dipshit. Hep B/any infectious diseases. OSHA broad authority protect work health safety approved vaccinations FDA made enforceable OSHA standard similar Blood Borne Pathogen standard. I‚Äôm sure quickly decided court.

 Safeguards good entirely appropriate. ""We're requiring get vaccinated, also going pay testing required unvaccinated employees"" Yep. behaving like former guy.  work there. UK base decision currently widespread delta variant? 

Yes, decision published week.  Can‚Äôt wait see crazy Q extended family members say one lmao. Yes, we've known Earth round far longer that, even. According Fauci, Israeli data boosters shows that‚Äôs that‚Äôs needed get back previous levels (or more) protection. entitled freedoms. freedom starve, freedom get evicted, etc. even dumber. Lose job want throw fit wearing mask lol 2025 everyone would take 4 shots every 3 months go jail. Stand excessive vaccine mandates know people got mrna JandJ  Totally, I'm saying vaccinated people want mandates. they've polled question different ways mandates pretty popular, like 60% range. North North Dakota. believe word thinking grandma's switch OSHA always right weigh individuals (and tools) order ensure various equipment weight limits met. think know talking about. Schools long history requirements vaccines. Lots employers don't. absolutely affects coworkers. Especially construction fields OSHA heavily regulates. job heavy physical activity dangerous obese person coworker.   Companies already impose home workplace requirements insurance purposes. experience it‚Äôs opt quit situation. OSHA mandates extend home work wouldn‚Äôt create new problem regard.

Edit: don‚Äôt want companies get hands home life either, alas already :/ Exactly. people batshit insane. Jesus obviously Korean. think much 15x greater... get figure? think aware? vaccination mandate. testing mandate allows exemption testing requirement vaccinated. Possibly, that's least understandable. right force inject something body might make sick? force stay home rest lives..... Damn, can‚Äôt use excuse then‚Ä¶ Thanks! too. taught never ever want suffocate death. It‚Äôs terrifying, helpless feeling. Another reason I‚Äôm glad got vaccinated! get vaccine. Starve me, beat me, take anger me. man spent entire election season discussing absurd political division pushing need come together -- sure divisive speech. guy responsible huge amount Covid misinformation.

I made much longer post detailing really feel dude got removed automoderator showing lack civility. Yeah, I'm civil towards guy. Better people literally dying. Unreal people willing sacrifice people‚Äôs lives complain anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt protect themselves. Zero self-awareness.  Yikes that‚Äôs terrible.   NC seat battle too. 
u/jeffjacksonNC sights set.  sort mandate health policy making people go ‚Äúfit testing‚Äù. can‚Äôt pass respiratory hearing test can‚Äôt work certain jobs.  labor shortage lazy bums choosing go getting vaccinated, choosing go work soul hurts. actual doctors note stating unable vaccinated due health reasons, still pay weekly testing? literally cannot afford weekly testing one rare ones literally unable get vaccine. see Hunter gets (massive hog) Nope, guess point ""not knowing long term effects vaccine"" really hold up. empirical evidence long term effects either, would choose go scientists around world, spent years researching kind thing, get vaccine? Seems counter intuitive Unpleasant fucking understatement. Every time got tested like trying get brain. sure. think it‚Äôs going lasting impact nursing. know ton quit order make money control schedule going agency. worries. Nope got call dentist today blue cancelling appointment next week. said don‚Äôt accept insurance anymore, Medicaid.

I saw federal mandate facilities receive Medicaid funding vaccinate employees‚Ä¶.seems like crazy weird timing ü§î needed good news today. get vaccinated, people. Everyplace around levels services products desperate help. employee's market right now. go Wawa lot I'm lazy. uninitiated Wawa convenience store makes food (sandwiches, subs, etc). start pandemic, anyone mandated masks, Wawa required them. People wore them. mandates came later. Then, pandemic let up, people stopped wearing them. required infection picked up. one estates staff, one enforces it.

People figure own. Drunk driving victimless crime I'll know!!! drunk crashing I'm against. Hammers dumb. people evil fuck too.  already do. 

You can‚Äôt get testing proof non-infection clinics order travel, attend concerts, etc. reason believe covid tests ordered doctor something like upcoming surgery. extremely disappointed Biden dem nomination generally disapprove him, great applaud balls tough things. vaccinations Afghanistan. 

More based Joe, please. Good. Looks like today first 2k+ death day USA since winter. Worldo us 1929, probably another 300 back dated Florida eventually.

Great time getting 104k people together football game weekend. Didn‚Äôt wear mask, didn‚Äôt debt since lockdown, kept freedoms, better mental health since lockdown lower deaths world. Swedish strategy success you‚Äôre mad it. Yep, anything beyond vaccinations occasional boosters long term hard ""He added hopes view video understand people Rutherford County defined adults heckled him.""

Kudos director schools offering apology (although he's one needs apologize), unfortunately, he's going discover way many people Rutherford County \*are\* fact defined idiots. 

I predict Mr. Knox beneficiary rural brain drain, likely move away within next several years. Plus whole system fucked good get painlessly even best situations. Tho Gov would probably get law changed case, rush 'his' folks front line. unilaterally declared authority determine constitutional. explicitly written that. Using logic, force people drive sober? It‚Äôs cruel stupid make something don‚Äôt want do!  time.

Did employees start dying since? got shots, told company expect working following two days case bad reaction. fully supportive. never needed time off, needed it. Previous mask/vaccine mandates meant shit, one either great news, might actually chance getting job. ‚ÄúSilver lead?‚Äù Sure original comment said 5 people died room hospital quote article says case.

Additionally, I‚Äôd inclined believe people dying waiting treatment direct source instead ‚Äúother officials‚Äù ‚Äúsome‚Äù pass away waiting bed. comes hearsay rumors provided journalist. may true, don‚Äôt know. 

Anyhow, thanks sharing article. It‚Äôs interesting hear happening parts country. 

I doubt problems hospitals due pandemic like everyone, want end. took vaccine, wear mask, try stay informed, hoping best.

They're waiting talking points Tucker Carlson tonight. states require really good reason quit can't collect unemployment (e.g. family needs, illness, spouse got new job town, etc.). put radiation metal/plastic contact body. thinking lets never eat use medicine technology studied 50 years.

With rapid spread, choose side effects either coronavirus vaccine. freaking obvious what's better bet. I've done week year, BIG DEAL.

No, don‚Äôt. Maybe rapid tests I‚Äôve tested multiple times pandemic never even give insurance info better make get one herself. Shockingly, there's stick smart ass. Working site obese person kill grandma. nobody remember tan suit emergency? dijon mustard scandal?  Central Oregon  problem approach: taxing system innocent people unnecessarily. cannot rely it. Innocent people dying stress injustice. People losing at-risk loved ones antiv*xxers flooding system.

Your approach working. killing people too.

This state overreach. constitutional. Take me, l\*bertarian (more right-fiscally, c\*nservative socially). Anc*p exactly situations like NEED rules place whole system come crashing down. living right now.

I much agree wish necessary. Sadly, necessary. We've done can, avenues exhausted. else left? alternative people listen reason? belief people bark bite. remaining dangers society.

Edit: removed politics Read book. Thank helping vaccine mandate. helps country greatly. ""here"" place keep referring to? 

Where Atlanta, movie theater announced vax-or-test policy, going rapid tests sale on-site. also testing provider every two weeks.

I believe clinics refusing. that's I'm curious general location, since places seem devoid testing are. worked drive-thru covid test site last winter absolutely amazed nasty, hateful, straight ridiculous things people shouted every day. never would imagined many people problem verbally assaulting stranger job trying help.

I don‚Äôt believe boosting people who‚Äôs vaccine 5-10% less effective good use supply, except serious immune conditions 

That said I‚Äôd **never** join antivaxxers. I‚Äôve two shots, I‚Äôll another it‚Äôs required, think prioritize elsewhere first mandate test, vaccine exempts test

Well anytime there's need declare emergency I'd say global pandemic aught it. suppose we'll find out. meantime virus don't' give fuck laws there's that. 100$ covered entire day off? make less 12$ hour? Texas? That's $10k anyone everyone helped them.  vaccine get? pretty bad/nonfunctional first AZ shot. looking forward second same.  you‚Äôre vaccinated still transmit Covid? mutually exclusive? So, people already recovered get vaccine? Good voted Biden expected janitor. Somebody clean mess. disappointed. Plenty little mom pop restaurants less hundred employees looking help right now. Gig pay great get away vaccinated. Agreed, antivax nonsense also clear sign completely unqualified practice healthcare. really business begin with. long term studies effects COVID-19 either. choice is: want Covid shot without.

If say ""without"", pretty stupid. mean, would hope people like met quite I'm convinced. is, agree.

However... believe intentions public health. opinion, latest government action string overreaching actions past twenty years.

I'm proclaiming love anti vaxxers here, power fear nothing people resisting them. this, me, seems less effort public safety effort stamping dissenting opposition.

The reason mentioned cigarettes bad ""food"" tobacco related disease obesity kill four times many people annually country COVID-19 has, far, far longer. always floored cigarettes even legal. realize examples contagious like virus, second hand smoke thing environmental variables promoting obesity.

I cannot believe solely public health government demonstrated cannot care less reducing easily preventable death. said arguing mandates. I'm dismissing mandates, I'm them. whether something correct choice never based often solution used past.  Nothing forced. read actual mandate reddit balls say support vaccine see quite clearly overreach power unconstitutional?  think issued bear spray. legal argument would like ""constructive lay off"", fly anyway. Right, base even want take even calls ""beautiful shot"" tells to. post them. 

But start, enlightening article Israeli numbers many people like misinterpret data throw ‚Äú60%‚Äù fucking test weekly. FFS. you, manchild? Unstaffed beds worthless.   like going fight. choose many weapons decide. Fuck going buck naked smashed someone sword.

Its sad things like vaccinations polarising politicised This...will end well. Reinfections rare, poorly tracked, confounded exposure risk usable research this. near tell infection gives 100% protection severe reinfection. virus going mutate regardless whether selection pressure -- lack selection pressure would actually mean variants would viable. Also, immunity natural infections would act pretty much like immunity vaccines regard. ""argument"" pretty silly. That‚Äôs issue I‚Äôm addressing. They‚Äôre still un-American. I‚Äôm fully vaccine(s), it, individual.

If roommate/spouse/coworker decides get it, that‚Äôs them.

Should mandate every adult 1 hour moderate exercise day? would solve lot problems people would live lot longer. End day choose want live life. makes different past 100s years people claimed shit get bad?   military seems like odd example nature servicemen fewer freedoms people. George Washington required army inoculated small pox.   Hell yeah! Wish they'd get vaccine murdering couple coworkers right? 

Yes

We're pandemic unvaccinated people starting overwhelm hospitals, means people get care issues. 

This safe effective vaccine best bet getting back normal. Time everyone part help fellow americans.  Massive fucking government overreach. 

I vaccinated second available everyone, won‚Äôt hold court. literally tried murder you? 99% COVID deaths unvaccinated, overwhelmingly republican. Republicans downplayed denied virus start. Say liberals, cosmically stupid they'll die en masse preventable disease can't stop hyping bullshit forced sterilization fucking microchips facebook. right *clearly* nuts.  quit get fired cause (which refusing job requirement is), get unemployment anyway.

I wonder many expecting quit get unemployment extra money like ""lazy"" doing. don‚Äôt watch fox. consider trying think yourself. Maybe would something constructive contribute. Blah. Blah. Blah. 

I ain‚Äôt getting vaccine. you‚Äôre reason virus CDC acknowledged vaccines prevent spread delta variant, comprises nearly 100% current cases. declining effectiveness vaccines premise requiring vaccinated people masked push booster shots. Instead, agency emphasizes people vaccinated reduce risk hospitalization death. However, Israel, one world's fully vaccinated nations, COVID cases among vaccinated. U.K. last month, 40% cases received least one shot.‚Äù effective. Many countries wait 90 days infection receiving next dose - antibody cellular variety continues improve months infection, waiting give excellent result. make mandatory everyone form government assistance like unemployment, rent relief social security? family I.F. area, still oblivious everything trying ignore severity COVID favor returning everything ‚Äúback normal‚Äù. I‚Äôm New England although area relatively low number positive cases compared rest country, there‚Äôs still groups uninformed people power.

I told mother last week worried upcoming school year (I‚Äôm vaccinated work educator 13 year old received vaccine last spring) clueless I‚Äôd feel anxious. elated told district publicly stated return remote learning, circumstances. don‚Äôt think could rolled eyes back head. school board become echo chamber anti-mask anti-vax portion community.  Can't say I'm surprised don‚Äôt understand people agree forcing unemployment don‚Äôt feel need get vaccinated RemindMe! 1 year  Happening Alberta now. People cancer, waiting surgeries, they've postponed notice. people, death sentence.

Hopefully become unwilling sacrifice unvaccinated's freedom choose. One friends sonographer maternal fetal medicine doctor (aka everyone scans extremely high risk) refuses get vaccinated. can‚Äôt imagine attitude. She‚Äôs employed hospital hope end requiring Unemployment Florida low almost matter begin with.  hand, organization called USPS, employs 644,000 people exempt vaccine mandate. hell united country? clear choice. Get vaccinated get tested. guess I‚Äôm worried investment situation board members don‚Äôt Pfizer! Lol Btw fine $14k per violation, per friend teacher received email difference here. 10th amendment applies Congress much President.  hope right! I've already gotten 3rd shot Pfizer, much immune system I'm sure last. feel clear enough original comment, dismissing vaccine mandate, pointing flaw logic make big fuss realize one cares either squawk someone notice quietly get vaccine. know get unemployment? necessarily, no. lot fit bill experience wary *anything* overtly government getting put body general. Ooh. wonder ‚Äúletters Santa‚Äù programs get kids wish vaccine Christmas. heard ten-ish year old day complaining mom wasn‚Äôt fair couldn‚Äôt get shot yet. really problem. want vaccine, get keep job. bad, right anyone explain logic  case, clear government mandate, would easy prove. government mandate makes different companies mandating own.

And top that, many people quitting, REALLY easy deny UI for. Overreacting much?

Where Patriot Act? cops show wellness check last month. showed around midnight sleeping. went front heard loud banging door windows. Two cops, masks all. opened window spoke that. Fortunately saw cats accepted ""My cats run outside they're allowed go"" open door.

I'm always seeing cops area without mask. Masks mandatory inside live yet cops still refuse wear them. I'm mistaken, that's origin ""rule thumb"" I'm construction aggregate supply. Nation wide company multiple location across much Mid Atlantic, SE, SW. precautions. data I'm seeing hospitalized overwhelmingly unvaccinated.  ""It's right choose get vaccine.""

And

""You right get vaccine.""  quit still got unemployment. old boss told quit get fired side business (making hot sauce) even though work. sent email stating choice quit get canned. quit, saved email.

Filed unemployment. Got denied, immediately appealed email got full deal.

If someone gets forced quit way told quit get canned... wiggle room, smart get writing video/record. amount disgusting opinions people have. happy government forcing something like this. overreach power. Wait till force something don‚Äôt find necessary mandate it.  Go back original comment regarding for-profit health care fact insurance tied employment. quality life 100% tied fact work someone else terms.

If fire government forcing ensure vaccinated, yes, downsides unregulated capitalism take over.

I'm 100% board government forcing hand, idiots going like happens happens. They're also smart enough think far ahead, either. man I‚Äôd lying said didn‚Äôt love tears. Plus one local groups actually pretty good informing what‚Äôs going around town. joys living small rural town south üôÉ. 

It‚Äôs bad though, love neighborhood it‚Äôs quiet here. Never heard Washington communist. Must working British; never understood freedom! see reason time comes around public would able get despite prior COVID-19 vaccines. get flu shot every single year never asked manufacturer is!

Anyway, AZ + Pfizer going another Pfizer tomorrow (first two knock ass, expect this). Flu shot next month (has never knocked ass 24+ years talking it). Next year Moderna great booster available flu vaccine too, take that. Pfizer one, AZ one, J &amp; J one‚Ä¶ Public school policy need made state district level. could 300 million dollars everyone would give dollar. like way think.  long vaccinated status expires?  personally vaccinated think everyone be. think overkill. worry weakens HIPPA want employer able ask questions health like matter wins election people saying moving x country bluff Florida, btw.

ah, learned new word. Thank you.  actually shocking much country ""government contractors"" covers. Well upside, I‚Äôm sure fast food places excited get new employees‚Ä¶ Yeah states also making people leave due unwillingness vax ineligible unemployment benefits. Good luck finding job anywhere, getting unemployment, wider mandate place. I'm sure people totally feel like they're owning us sleep cardboard box street. Texas sucks confirmed.  Companies firing health insurance social safety nets unregulated capitalism finest.  couple employees I'm curious well. lot work government, I'm guessing we'll no-test-option group. couple staunchly unvaccinated folks would sad lose, think right call.  Link?  wait US needs, greater incarceration rate. knew lot people beginning said would get work requires it. can‚Äôt see giving cushy jobs. won‚Äôt get anywhere near benefits get move smaller company 100 people. 

My husband manages low wage low education anti vax people already high turn I‚Äôm sure make difference. That's kind job. 

Well, also supposed Congress's job, gave jack shit ago.  aren‚Äôt mandating vaccine now. mandate test, vaccine exempts test  required something part job, paid time. Depending particulars salaried employees situations might get anything, hourly workers absolutely can't assigned clock tasks. Recall Apple got trouble paying employees time spent waiting bag search leave building. They're capping (am using term correctly?). They're gonna give jobs.  Sounds like win you. Good. Fuck anti-vaxxers ‚Äúvaccine-hesitant‚Äù. Case point. harassers probably duty cops. Agreed cigarette laws. wacky they're legal all, especially substances kill tons people illegal kill people.

Also agreed food.

Funny, agree full mandate would less cruel stated. yeah, would huge backlash said think would warranted. whole thing implemented (assuming courts discard it) it'll definitely interesting see plays people react.

I appreciate conversation. sadly rare anymore able converse opposing viewpoints without foaming mouth. Reroll stats.  Lol thinking Democrats care public health refuse single payer. Nonexistent? hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlong term‚Äù yet. yeah that's coming lol probably are. I've never seen cop Kansas even wearing mask. Several died recently get vaccine. one fully remote going get Covid co-worker, that. here, completely four days first shot. actually pretty surprised terrible felt, arm hurt bad couldn‚Äôt lift first two days. Definitely worth though. Ironically antivax sister admitted hospital covid blood clots lungs day got vaccinated. second one coming far put together side effects mild since bad ones first. immortal words Scandal, [‚ÄúGoodbye enough emphasis could placed word should. yes, people stupid blame anyone else actually taking responsibility actions. not. USPS independent agency executive branch. corporation private. Oh idk I've tested several times Vax pretty unpleasant, recent Vax pretty timid every straight nostril rape slippery slope civil rights advocates we‚Äôre talking about. However... believe intentions public health. opinion, latest government action string overreaching actions past twenty years.

Holy shit, old you? literal fuck talking about?

Its ABSOLUTELY control. controlling PANDEMIC.  Jesus Christ, dude. paranoid lol.

People said shit seatbelts smoking public places airbags million things.  unemployment tent.

you guys tents? I‚Äôm happy people get vaccinated now. Sadly, anti-vaxx parents won‚Äôt qualify work smaller companies. Go rural areas, think they‚Äôre safe. they‚Äôre not. it‚Äôs late. 

See: Idaho.  work? get second pfizer dose done it? take moderna J&amp;J? *There also six new cases managed isolation two historical cases reported today.*

Hell, work wife's health insurance. lost job, we'd (potentially) screwed make decent income. protests going wild.

Only couple weeks. They're going hard time yelling that.  Seems mandates happened day one vaccines approved teens, plenty time summer sort out. still two months first dose required.

Just thoughts, don‚Äôt answers. anti-vax nonsense creating chaos suffering. can‚Äôt nice things. medical reason makes dangerous so, get vaccinated.  Wow. run across Beau before. watched 6 videos row. need calm thoughtful smart people like online.  Eloquent without reactionary. 

I guiltily admit prejudged thumbnail. Sad assumed position things heard speak. hard lesson me, especially since think would kind person. Really hard.  last 4 years really damage everyone realized affected thought. 

I can't thank enough sharing clip. Great story Beau bit life lesson me. hospital I‚Äôve working 31% nurses unwilling get vaccinated. I‚Äôm vaccination, mandates destroy country. Lol stupid Biden? really think going get Trump smells boys water he'll back 2024. 2022 definitely lost Dems now, house go red Bidens days over.

Even media try Harding prop another 3-6 point approval rating hit he's going look totally incompetent supreme court knocks down. he's going look tyrannical weak.

God he's stupid. wonder means Kamala within next year. She'll terrible 2024 candidate. Wow.

And really biggest thing see unemployment spike 3-15%. Especially people waiting SC kill it. eviscerate economy.

Great time buy. Lol stocks drop biiiig next week buy buy buy. They'll bounce right back killed seems like backing companies want go ahead require afraid legal repercussions currently. require based mandate, without fear legal battles, courts decide go way.  important question: enforced? Lots stuff illegal still happens every damned day. Correct. federal employees civil service. unique set rules, common federal group. nothing kick virus curb would reduce number patients ICUs Entirely depends vaccine contracted price. everyone got deal manufacturers.   worth, there's never better time quit job, given economy-wide labor shortage.  see NOFX, upvote. Opting unemployment seems line lack judgement getting vaccinated. 

Upside: Suddenly job opportunities millennials. Floridian hates governor done state, I‚Äôm happy hear this. Take business elsewhere, consumer dollars speak volumes. dIfFeReNt thing statistically, probably survive covid. Hell, decent portion likely even breeze it, even feel all. embolden further. 

It's one cruelest parts pandemic. We've lost many good people virus, yet stopped nothing perpetuate essentially gotten away it. Public school systems state government, unless private, receive federal funding...so I'm interested see falls well. 83% immunity May (natural + vaccine). delta explosion since would think 90% point. soldiers command...

Wouldn't forced get too? COVID pandemic really diminished respect nurses (as group) US. high level anti-vaxerism among says lot quality science education nursing schools. That‚Äôs braindead are.

Is reason would refuse agree extremely minor thing? Time see much Republicans love small businesses! Vaccine mandates ruled constitutional twice. relate whether OSHA jurisdiction mandate health requirements?

You can‚Äôt pick choose administer law. Either authority dictate kind health decisions employees make don‚Äôt.

If fine employers allowing people smoke obese. don‚Äôt mandate unconstitutional.

There middle ground.  don‚Äôt see people don‚Äôt get this. There‚Äôs least one two videos front page lately people getting fired stupid shit involving Covid / masks / vaccine etc last weeks. I‚Äôd safe limit movements. Helps contact tracing test positive stage/they announce someone flight infected work fairly large company said 60% vaccinated whatever worth yet China managed eliminate disease domestically. New Zealand, Singapore well. Quite countries done similarly well eventually eliminating disease. Australia pretty well recently too.

The problem lot Western governments went half-asses 'flatten curve' strategy. strategy guarantees disease becomes endemic.  isn‚Äôt you. point clearly missed!!! two types nasal swabs. uncomfortably annoying one nasal-pharyngeal one stick swab past finger go ‚Äî call brain swab. don‚Äôt like leave think so. requirements unemployment allow good degree agency discretion, particularly talking people quitting job.  think point people sick Covid overwhelm hospitals (since assumption likely hospitalized unvaccinated) take away care people might need it, like cancer patients. Mr. Biden people seem assume unvaccinated lunatics go lives without wearing masks spreading virus. tell first hand, always case, people, including president, need stop thinking black white.  mofo posts link trying prove point doesn‚Äôt even read possibly understand it. wrong. 

I think hit great point that's overlooked. Even fear vaccine, whatever takes get healthy stay safe. think vaccines alone probably would helped stay hospital. Like myself, also obese, vaccine much I'm overweight high BP inflammation running rampant system. People take seriously enough help themselves. Exercise, wear mask around people, healthy, get shot. things combined ups person's chances stay hospital die. nothing all, that's inviting trouble. ask this. even phrase mean, speaking topics know little about? 

Hilarious see *you* asking question. hope Zurrdroid's second comment made sense you. moving goalposts. said ""weren't getting fired unvaccinated"". are. Hahahahaha.... No, won't. They'll say would passed anyway call communist dictator.

It makes sense anything issued Executive Order already motion, lot departments different levels government must scrambling right figure details here. took us long? really used AstraZeneca since June. sitting Pfizer Moderna would rather understandable could argued holding boosters immunocompromised. can't envision justification holding AstraZeneca till weeks left forcing recipients scramble. Suspect boosters mandated long original vaccination remains protective severe illness &amp; hospitalization. push much hospital capacity.  wonder many remaining 1/4 people antivaxxers like... type person bothered going dentist two years.

Since matter 10% unemployed.

Then can't live   really want lose job vaccine? employer says refuse vaccine go ""non-disciplinary separation"". mean ""not cause""? metadata says used total population, adjusted proportion that's vaccinated, can't possibly **To compare fully vaccinated unvaccinated cases** counts given time period adjusted corresponding population Colorado vaccinated (14 days completion recommended doses) unvaccinated time period. Cases hospitalizations displayed rates per 100,000. Due low counts, counts deaths due COVID displayed rates per 1 million. example, calculate rate per 100,000 fully vaccinated cases week starting August 15, 2021, count fully vaccinated cases week divided number Coloradans fully vaccinated Wednesday week (August 18, 2021), multiplied 100,000. calculate rate per 100,000 unvaccinated cases week, count unvaccinated cases week divided number Coloradans unvaccinated Wednesday week, multiplied 100,000.

According [main covid data 830 hospital admissions week 8/15.

Using total population colorado, hospitalization rate week would `14.4 hospitalizations per 100k`, higher vaccinated, `3.5 per 100k` unvaccinated `13.2 per 100k`, must number in-between.

I think normalization vaccinated vs unvaccinated population ever even done. guess (sorry, [don't report fully vaccination rate August 18th, say 62.6% 108 830 cases among vaccinated population 3.08 million, leaving 722 cases among unvaccinated. rate 13.2 cases per 100k leaves remaining unvaccinated population Colorado 5.4 million, almost entire population Colorado! makes total population 8.5 million people colorado get numbers, obviously wrong. Also, infections means chances mutations--and vaccinated population means selective pressure favor resistant mutations.

Or, y'know, listen health advice instead social media, that's doctors for, average person need study medicine understand what's safe not. piss poor argument. intentions absolutely public health. 

The government issuing correct sort advice healthy lifestyle decades. Eat well balanced diet get regular exercise. 

Sure wanted make people healthier could ban cigarettes alcohol. unfortunately tried prohibition it‚Äôs futile. could ban unhealthy foods, people would find ways eat unhealthy shit. People want consume vices. isn‚Äôt whole lot government it. 

But vices part effect user alone. ban sorts usages effect others like drunk driving smoking public spaces. 

It‚Äôs way easier get bunch people get vaccine get completely change long held diet exercise activity habits. could, I‚Äôd thank billion times. It‚Äôs people like her, courage first participants clinical trials. Absolutely zero Covid-19 cases moment.

They're funny cern.  friend's sister nurse there. one day four covid patients died. awesome. makes life little easier vaccinated, far less likely severe case, mask rule also acknowledges vaccine prevent spread.

Spoiler: gonna many Millennials middle aged.  I‚Äôve clarified comment. ER must make vaccine hep available employees opt out. vaccine must made available potential exposure blood bodily fluids.  got vaccine emergency approval. 13 year olds LA get vaccine emergency approval tomorrow. Ah sweet smell ignorance allowing tyranny take hold  people can't honor basic tenet living modern society like ""Help us plague"", maybe good people lose power standing.  word mandate opposite word freedom. take court see requirement legal.  I'm guessing logic something like: ""Telling ~~people~~ companies get vaccinated 100 employees hurt business, ergo, anti-capitalism"" Yep, 100%. ever seen application able life 25 lbs? fact medical question. asking physical capabilities perform job asked safe manner doesn‚Äôt put company, it‚Äôs employees it‚Äôs customers risk illness injury. involves whether job safely, ask related medical questions want. 

As far birth control question, Navy even requires women meet medical advisors contraception provides women due fact many women used get pregnant within first 2 years service. entire program called LARC. 

I‚Äôm hard time finding civilian jobs would require currently internet know I‚Äôve heard heard people required form birth control order long term research assignments remote areas limited medical aid interventions. 

If medical issue high chance happening without proper preventative measures would impact ability job paid could negatively impact company chose work for, every legal right require interventions it‚Äôs employees. ever worked job hard hat required? vaccine considered hard hat terms law. wear hard hat jobs increased odds things falling could injure kill you. It‚Äôs 100% effective since companies OSHA started requiring them, odds dying injury dropped significantly. unable use one safety devices wasn‚Äôt reasonable accommodation could made different design, don‚Äôt hire could even fire you. get vaccine work job work around people reason. plan gives option, day paid go get 2 jabs weekly testing. 100% choice, 100% legal.  possible influenza mild symptoms even symptoms unlike COVID. significant symptoms extremely debilitating week, sometimes even more.  That's get.

Pretty pointless. run human sacrifice poor. This. Here‚Äôs nice evidence vaccine good idea‚Ä¶..how still anti-vaxxers anti-maskers?

If hospital needs huge refrigerator keep deceased cold,just maybe vaccine good idea.  Even better, add fourth option. Get jab let employee take fake swabs every week like $1. 

Then tell friends family still unvaxed. know egos fragile admit anyone gave inch libs. never said Chinese government acted straight forward honest manner, rarely do. president exact fucking thing. fact remains citizens way better handling like adults were. We'd WAY better position today citizens would quit acting like selfish spoiled children.

WE blame this. Shit happens, ya gotta deal it. Chinese government blame predicament in. decides leave country find work abroad...

Theres people claiming want freedom choice taking responsibility choice. still option too. get tested weekly. want vaccine that's price dude. Prove danger rest us. sucks  Same, vaccinated it‚Äôs truly frightening people supporting don‚Äôt find problematic Let remind hospitals overwhelmed COVID cases, mostly UNvaccinated people, people DIED treatable conditions couldn‚Äôt access care needed hospitals filled UNvaccinated COVID patients. that‚Äôs all. People need hospital care didn‚Äôt die well could been. Healthcare workers stressed. add that, quitting placing even stress healthcare workers working extra time short-staffed.

If people vaccinated, hospitals work patients wouldn‚Äôt faced facing. it‚Äôs possible delta might never gotten foothold has. 

But no. People like don‚Äôt think beyond narrow focus vision.  I'm required hep c flu vaccine(each year) health care. would legal? Osha well. litteraly can't work either those. Maybe allow time vaccine fully approved 12-15 year olds? Right it‚Äôs still EUA age group.  Imagine ok this.   president doesn‚Äôt ability create laws. legislative branch does. isn‚Äôt debate whether executive order ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs overreach power sets precedent future overreach power may ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing. live dictatorship.  I've informed incorrect. time year pumpkin spice. :) Right everything politicized whether want  guy seems great. Thanks sharing.  No. accountant deals franchised restaurants already dealing staffing shortage. must say worried.

I hope everyone get vaccinated. short midterm issues alarming. Guess helping everyone figure pay misplaced labor costs. difficult owners already dealing increased expenses less revenue.

Honestly, can't imagine small business able pay weekly testing. might advise company shortly 100 employees set new company. I'm biggest fan Biden (and absolutely despise Trump.. since lot people can't handle notion liking two people) holy shit dude jumping much needed grenades. COVID shit gone long enough 100% people wanting cooperate multitude literally insane reasons.

Also dude finally withdrew troops afghanistan. People shit sloppy/bad TWENTY FUCKING YEARS throwing away taking lives there, stopped it. People love suddenly act like armchair generals (such user reddit suggested could ended taliban one strike.. believed entirety taliban mobilized needed attack road..) peaceful way end republicans fucking rock hard able shout ""BIDEN ARMED TALIBAN!""

Unfortunately grenades he's jumping going make easy dunk 2024, I'm fully expecting things sway republican resume push back toward middle ages. gives shit? Sticks usually filled brim whoop ass.   Well sounds like I'm getting new job higher pay. üòÜüñï could say termination cause means unemployment. analogy, extension it. use carrot stick bait, work use stick. statement 2020??? Oh nvm.

They chance, it‚Äôs time get line. people crazy enough do. saw someobody saying plans live job it, also mentioned also shows children important stand things believe.

I admire courage, would able risk livelihood extension child's well something read Facebook.  Fine ends vaccination. I'll even shine people ""yeah, tough break, can't let win! think scared shot throw career away, well, joke's them! can't get rid easily, can't wait see faces whip vaccination card. Hell, I'll even go take pic rub nose it. Shit, man, chicken. Let's go right get jump them"" number countries anti-vaxx knuckleheads too.

How explain that?   hope legal order temporarily pause it‚Äôs settled courts. bonus unemployment gone, damn.  I'm vaccinated, personally chose be. people think mandate much know government works. Checks balances allow this, state government true say like gum laws Marijuana. seems like extreme overreach.

Many people still think vaccination immunize population eradicate virus, not, data highly vaccinated countries like Israel, UK etc. showing exactly that.

Less stress ICU less deaths severe cases definitely positive outcome, virus stay go anywhere all.

Let them, like benefits getting stimulated again. government already program covers costs associated medical care needed injury caused vaccine. idea well works, already existing option scenario. would overcomplicate things. Even natural immunity last forever, keeping dose dates tracked better long run english third language. stole vocabulary first two. really give shit.   Interesting...

My hospital employer required vaccine, required flu vaccines. *suspect* big part state association needs follow state laws. 

For instance, gay marriage legal across country, provide benefits same-sex couples, even though *said* liked idea, people recognized state law. started diversity education stuff pull racist shit governor like idea diversity training--we literally go site pull stuff day.

So since vaccine can't mandated state nonsense, *assume* that's able require employees, assuming still want sweet state money.

HOWEVER, think Medicare trumps (the word, former president) state's interests about...everything? ran little ""hiccup"" getting Medicare long ago *clusterfuck*.

So sneaking suspicion we're going see different sort messaging soon. ;-) I'm sorry feel bad all, one single bit. months scientists doctors saying vaccines way prevent death hospitalizations.

Society delicate enough caste 7% forbade work create chaos. less effect banning black people (11%) working would society.

But problem: 10% hardlines NOW. heavy handed approach like make vaccination culture war issue, basically republicans become vaccines.

2) Defeated Covid (it matters president ""end"" national emergency)

3) Booming economy (again, depends 1)

4) Got us Afghanistan (the evac forgotten, LOT people barely resonate 9/11 anymore became ""near-distant"" memory within years)

5) Student loans forgiven partially forgiven &lt;---this get massive votes

The first 4 alone campaign likely win ASSUMING things move along. gets #5, shoe-in.

But IMHO... judgement bro, remember getting first dose back april started hanging friends again, still would mask though bit lenient stuff. course, 2 shots offer better protection. go, fun man! 18 months shit crazy I'm hoping mine follow Everybody seems love making argument, military requirements different general population. vaccine mandates. vaccines. exceptions legitimate medical reason (allergies, conditions could cause die vaccine etc.).

This x 1000.

It's protecting public health, controversial. religious exemptions removed. I've got Pfizer assume they'll same. Sounds like good way get done. Might take next day though, together might rough.

There's already massive civil disobedience. lockdowns mask mandates people still refused stay home wear masks public. r/PublicFreakout _filled_ videos maskless, self-entitled Karens harassing minimum wage workers audacity imply okay spread COVID. seems like point. Make difficult expensive test forever employers mandate vaccine hire vaccinated people. think honestly better outright mandating since that's handle vaccinations schools industries require it. mask testing requirements likely ease kids get vaccinated reach high enough threshold protect can't vaccinated. problem right people try part small percentage people herd immunity protects well get shot riding coattails need group hoping nobody notices them. way stop that. 

We tried nice giving space route, tried reasoning them, tried carrots. There's way let go forever. option left. done done earlier mess we're now. could go long way towards making holiday travel safer mitigate winter surge would harmful economically fallout unreasonable people throwing tantrums. really hate generalize, worked healthcare many years nurses... brightest bulbs socket part.

Even currently possible, suspect eventually Biden make employer's ability verify someone's vaccine status another incentive get folks get jab. Regardless, anyone lies employer they're vaccinated they're committed fraud possible Feds could investigate prosecute without even informing company question.

Anyone decides commit fraud right trusting information readily available medical database never catch them. interesting see justice system decides address folks. People choose consequences actions.  Let's see Republicans like bounties people name protecting children now! LOL. Employers least 50 employees required provide FMLA. obviously US Department Labor impose regulations employers.

Actually wasnt meant joke. would never hire anyone wasn‚Äôt vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt trust ability process information.

And vaccination status one protected classes US either constitutional law statutory law. someone valid medical exemption course different almost religions don‚Äôt permit vaccination part dogma. Exactly, can't even make mind timeline would put much stock they're saying say one? Since great state Texas loves offering bounties, hope Biden offers rewards people reporting companies aren‚Äôt enforcing required vaccinations.

As someone works bunch fucking idiots, could make years salary pretty quick. little disingenuous say difference vaccines dealing right now.

Why? 
 
And even here, nobody ""forced"" get it. LAUSD offers online-only option kids want come school person.   It‚Äôs goddam time!    Employment guaranteed United States...most states right-to-work offers even less protections. Biden MANDATING vaccines people, mandating businesses comply OSHA regulations (funny, OSHA regulations favor employees OK, this). people country want work. But, working GUARANTEED constitution. People welcome leave jobs dead-set mandate.

I know personally left job support policies company worked (employee treatment, health ""personal decisions""). Took year find new job. So, sympathy. idiots quit day long important vaccinate. fill roles small mom pops seem struggling employees! keep moving career ""good jobs"" vacate! Win win everyone would charge pandemic response, currently failing catastrophically? circumstances qualify unemployment even quit. example, quit hostile unsafe work environment.

Obviously, apply here. I'm sure we'll see numbnuts try argue does. move simultaneously hurt big business, would happy.

Exactly. ""enemies"" would support vaccine mandate thus Trump would go way make sure something like never happened.   No, get fired work railroad coworkers spouting bullshit. Guess we‚Äôll find out. true. 

While majority 30% likely fans Democratic party Biden, naive think ~100million people sort evil morons radicalized anti-vaxers. Many much normal people interact would think twice. like Democrats got vaccine still oppose mandates advanced ID's.

The country world longer tolerance lockdowns again.

This challenges blanket claim vaccination prevents serious illness.

""Where sign vaccinations? give Liberty that? lie (I meant give liberty give death, cool)."" similar thing happened California. open late spring things going back normal two months cases started going up. know I'd call backfiring though. think people realized covid stay foreseeable future waves come go. able enjoy couple weeks low cases go also mature adults go back masks. 

We live world people travel freely over. even positivity rate low, restrictions come down, positivity rate go up. positivity rate low take mask off, gets high, put back on. get hard put genie back bottle. rather time restrictions rather restrictions forever even positivity rates 2%  Reread 10th Amendment.

Levying taxes provide public services, criminalizing dangerous behavior laws, regulating business practices protect consumers economy, yes even mandating vaccines (which federal government done many times - child cannot attend public schools without certain vaccines). burden proof person demonstrate mandate - certainly authoritarian - categorically different types authoritarian behavior government engages necessity every day. 

Additionally, executive order commissioned democratically elected president (likely) falls within scope powers issued executive constitution. issued dictator. might say it‚Äôs *kind* thing dictator would do, line reasoning requires substantiation... dictatorial authoritarian government actions performed democratically elected bodies 70 percent 12+ pretty low Covid killed Americans ww2, Korean War Vietnam war combined. world war 2, entire nation mobilized war effort - food supplies rationed, whole industries required switch priorities.

That said, people anti-vaxxers obviously take Covid seriously knows really happened. involvement OSHA limited, impression things like steel-toed boots required paid employers. Non-specialty gear used offsite. so, would lead believe paying tests could easily fall employee, too. Many companies actually giving people 100 USD get vaccinated.

Now im waiting booster.

Nobody forcing take anything. family taken seriously.

We write blaming parents makes us feel safe like won‚Äôt endanger kids parents vaccinated. false. Little kids still can‚Äôt vaccinated exposed million different ways. Pretending kids unvaccinated parents risk silly. 

We hold states like Texas accountable protecting young kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated. Kids protected even born idiots that‚Äôs opposite happening Texas.

‚ÄúThe weekly COVID-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization rate per 100,000 children adolescents‚Äù  is!  TBH there's much precedent much what's happened previously.

I'm south too, NC. I'm going look mask, every mask recommended never fits kid. Correct, mean essential healthcare *know* safe. Lol unvaxed group caught dead Europe anyway like piss cannot do.  give full approval, still around less year. mean anything point made, speculate assume know longer term effects. Sorry covid exactly problem area, actually thinking forced get vaccinated long term issues could be. Honest question: people haven‚Äôt received vaccine T-cell immunity previous exposure COVID? shown natural immunity success newer strains vaccine does. Would people considered ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô? Good you! never joined Facebook rejoice daily decision.  Italy. We've 4-7000 daily cases weeks now, actually holidays ending reproduction rate plummeting. We're 0.95 dropping (last year never went 1.05).

We'll see happens schools reopen, can't see major restrictions coming winter. worst they'll close restaurants again. See that‚Äôs point (based comments) data/information there, valid valid. information well like number people die vaccine itself. know two people got it, ended blood clots (one lost leg, almost died lungs)

Is vaccine working, extent, say yes? level makes people feel like necessary risk. 

Circling back antibodies, ignored what? (Not smart ass, literally asking)

People unvaccinated (not saying I‚Äôm one those) would probably inclined listen people weren‚Äôt assholes lol.

This article tells us nothing already know headline misleading. far, Mu variant kind founder's effect Columbia out-competed Delta elsewhere. main take=away theory could still get variant highly transmissible escapes vaccines would bad, Mu yet.

It's definitely worth looking articles know there's additional bad news there, tldr there's nothing new. I‚Äôd assume so. There's gonna many tradesmen quitting   knew stick took beat people taking vaccine would small?

Using force fuels resistance. True, comment ableist apologize poor choice words, time, we're running terms replace whatever sort mental defect people have. Yes, tend educated spread fairly evenly across social strata; specific type dumb arse. One malignant self-righteous extremely smug.  breakthrough cases expected range then.. wondering situation worsening vaccinated people well. I‚Äôm stoked there‚Äôs finally policy this, hard time believing hospital actually enforce it. Roughly third nurses work vaccinated, short staffed constantly is. There‚Äôs way admin gonna let 30% us go they‚Äôre already begging us stay. I‚Äôve heard talks many unvaxxed nurses claim ‚Äúreligious exemption‚Äù‚Äî guess Facebook mom fucking religion now. link studies? Often, no, weren't. varies company hospital system. immunity wanes time reinfected, simply nature respiratory virus. sterilizing immunity common cold coronaviruses, reason think one would different.

As happens coronaviruses infect humans, likely repeated exposure means subsequent infections less severe, point certain amount exposure may even symptomatic. cold coronaviruses big deal, born innate immunity passed mothers provides us blueprint mount immune response.

So, previously infected one two things: sick half dozen times, cheat get vaccinated booster, maybe two, forget it. infected get 2 boosters, 5 exposures virus.

Also, natural immunity best. play hospitalization/death/long term effects lottery achieve it. However infected, get one vaccine shot, may set immunity future pandemic looking recent studies. want that? good point people actual medical reasons getting vaccinated biggest supports vaccination health depends others vaccinated    can‚Äôt smell crazy first page? actually prominent experts agree you, principal. problem there's way include natural immunity mandate like without incentivizing ""covid parties,"" learned early pandemic, lead hospitalization death. Damn countries high education rates. Phooey.  I've ratted passengers chin diaper thing. times, flight attendants jumped action. definitely frustrating, stop holding selfish people accountable That's sunk-cost fallacy. I'm saying leave - great reason stay, itself.

I think need 3 things job stay (this decide):

1. pay enough/close market
2. hate it/can tolerate it/am respected
3. I'm learning advancing direction want Except private companies 100 employees option weekly tests. So, choice, test weekly get vaccine, federal Govt forcing get taxes old people. pensions, IRA, SS checks state income taxes. believe get unemployment quitting.

Not nurses women.

They can't necessarily afford quit, people ruin lives.  longer trouble makers begin with? logistics setting system track weekly testing employees seems like huge hassle. fuck - theres huge fine waiting them.

I could see employers saying fuck testing aspect telling employees get vaccinated. gotten bogged tribalism, yes, social groups playing huge role. There's also strong culture contrarianism government action rural areas, literally ""Don't tell do,"" regardless thing they're told. last decade, contrarianism extended experts kinds; people rejecting anything learn Facebook obscure YouTuber, kind reflex. pretty major crisis US politics right now. role government provide services free available all..?

\-It never going two weeks. Yes, idiotic first weekend March happened said family 18-24 month event they'd better prepare mentally it.

\-The 'percentage needed attain herd immunity' guesses best opinion anyone saying 70% disingenuous. 

\-The 'sudden discovery' media public vaccines offer *sterilizing immunity* shows extreme ignorance of...the media public. vaccines not, fact, offer sterilizing immunity ala smallpox vaccine. Vaccines hepatitis polio example, not. Try explaining population real understanding biology can't read past headline. 

\-Points 5 6 much same. always knew things beginning. referencing MASS MEDIA sources information, much inaccurate, incorrect, hyperbolic, present nuance information. added 'incoherence' first time saw science taking place real time pre-prints every rando statement made doctor anywhere became headline news-not pan ever accurate begin with. AGAIN-this information mass media sources-often headlines article text even support quoted study saying.

As far first sentence, ship long sailed. government routinely forces injections public. Schools done 170 years, 1905 Supreme Court upheld compulsory vaccination laws. option take weekly tests instead (for private companies). Nobody forcing take anything. Americans body autonomy decided based live.

Well, State's rights thing, live decide lot laws subjected to. saying right that's is. Vaccine mandates, order constitutional must choice... medical exemptions, religious exemptions, simple ability say no..

The exemptions still force person COVID tested weekly. right choice medical procedures subject still violated. Whether test, vaccine, abortion, role government make services free available private citizens use discretion. Ok and? Making mandate going change that. terrible people vaccinated continue be. odds enforced, actually anything, small. someone decide enforce it, ok. probably take German vaccine commission half year officially recommending rest world administers millions vaccines... allowing medical exemptions, she'll likely need doctor's note. details within week, OSHA releases new policy. least they‚Äôre punishing vaccinated ones Patton Oswalt totally earned respect this! Ask stapler. conservatives states don‚Äôt agree mandate, could see receiving it, it‚Äôs political gain days article points back laboratory study Australia. Researchers noticed ivermectin killed Covid petri dish, concentrations much higher given humans.

The human-based studies followed shown positive effects, save one article withdrawn following allegations fraudulent research. said better odds, say better life.

Either way, seem like lot people‚Äî especially majority vaccinated‚Äî perhaps good ole fashion super spreader. agree. saying it‚Äôs important. saying people likely read article says 1000% increase rather 1000 sick children. That‚Äôs 1000/74 million children (0.000013%). Media click bait goes ways matter outlook, abuse language get money. Still dealing impact COVID family unfortunately.

They mostly worked. Except brew pub Padua, hostess looked cards asked Daughter, Italian, ‚ÄúWhat supposed this?‚Äù

We ate outside.   pay $200/month, plus get tested weekly - cost Delta likely pass also.

The Delta could pass hospital bills also.  Probably even require get paid sick leave time sick vacrine, though. also missing critical information.
Specifically part critical response. 
As in, percentage people aren‚Äôt going bother anything (wear mask distance get vaccinated) sticks around. 
Also, still doesn‚Äôt eliminate gap knowledge significant % less likelihood getting infected vaccinated illness get severe‚Ä¶So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs forever, would rather be? unvaccinated person higher likelihood getting overall higher likelihood getting severe case? no? adults deserve sucker punch face Vaccine effectiveness varies person well. Immunity derived infection comparable immunity derived vaccine. absolutely make sense proof prior infection treated similarly proof vaccination. fully vaccinated March. thus understand concerns.

You seen ideological make United States Supreme Court right? absolutely **""could""** strike down. make vegas odds 50/50 moment. next question long take get bite particular apple. voting? show ID photo please! step forward, we've taken many, many, many steps backwards. Even another 10 million vaxed, even kids vaxed still peter out. still tens millions unvaxed keep alive permanently, mention vaxed 9x% protected. 

The realistic way see coronavirus us rest lives scenario new variant particularly lethal (like mortality) vaccination antibody testing becomes legally required citizens. 

Only chance beating affliction, treatments vaccines time still effective enough. effective enough today, 80%+ people get them. believe US around 56% fully vaxed moment. 

We literally could beaten coronavirus US months ago, tens millions who's suspicious government mainstream society overrode sense responsibility.

why write whole article response innocuous comment? need get reddit. president push something big through, push anything through. even point Congress us electing representatives anymore point.  Exactly. phobia going kill much brain thinks will. Covid may kill make incredibly miserable long time. already far deaths .1% 

Almost double, fact.

And 600,000+ deaths concern you, simply think species me.   I'm person responded you, subs tend lot disingenuous people ""just asking questions"". be!! always assumed timeline started god damned bird dropped baguette damaged LHC  Technically people quitting instead taking vaccine. sure new bill people fired refusing vaccine.

[GOP Bill Gives Payments Workers Quitting Vaccination  took daughter 1 year old check July ped tried call cancel appointment seeing needed vaccines. said careful avoid Drs offices especially possible, he'd sent record amount kids children's hospital late.

He dx'd prescribed daughter eyedrops antibiotics sinus infection email last week want coming office exposed RSV/COVID. Said he'd since June üò≠ correct. Polio killing everyone sides war. George implemented vaccine mandate worked.   rule, evidence accurate SARS-CoV-2. strains transmissible, may deadly.

And speaking relationship transmissibility deadly virus may be. generally inverse correlation viruses. 

Cars - better put - choice people make cars put people risk. ban cars? 

No level personal risk assessment people take. 

If vaccinated- someone else vaccinated putting risk. FUCK PEOPLE WORK? Hey, mind freshly opened spots. I've seen huge uptick recruiters contracting 1.5 years school, I'm currently punching way pay grade experience level. Life bad, I'll gladly take spot people tossing away opportunities avoid fauchi ouchi üòÖ

I'm planning moving Germany least 4-5 years grad school open spots supercharging career opportunities abroad. youngster least C1 German experience I've hopefully two masters degree's able cozy nice life covid life finally surpasses Wow - case heard saying ""the last straw broke camel's back? oh course! im quarantine 10 days now. want know long wait wont test positive again.  really happy article it‚Äôs capitalism Biden mentioned POC solution access, decent portion population distrusting medical industry government. know 14 million people looking job. I'm arguing one way vaccine mandates, we've done something long time mean correct course action ^ right here!!!! directly targeted Delta Neat, tell nurse friends work large cities beyond exhausted seeing people young old dieing every day almost seems unreal (and crazy) there‚Äôs still ppl haven‚Äôt won‚Äôt get vaccine fired get unemployment. laid company lack work does, things outside workers control reasonable ability (you fired ice cube factory worker unless move Antarctica). Unvaccinated people give virus extra hosts time mutate something worse Delta. 

Also, pandemic nature public health emergency, means fought broad, public response piecemeal dipshittery we‚Äôve allowed people get away with.   encouraging. adults can‚Äôt protect kids maybe kids protect adults. It‚Äôs fine, company needs fresh blood Unlimited unpaid vacation days though Lol! Vaccine mandates part history America century. something new I'm sure that. TBH, really huge Biden fan sort stuff would drive polls. Shows dems actually stand make hard decisions greater good society. amyloid plaques common think. read cadaver OC study looking brains Alzheimer‚Äôs vs healthy controls many healthy controls plaques brains, despite symptoms. either takes hell lot plaque notice it‚Äôs complicated that. closest thing think ""survivor bias."" directly same, similar vein, ""I made it, done succeed"" kind attitude. deal it? Shut instead going morons? Fucking sad. Brilliant! can't receive UI voluntarily quitting job anyway. people really better start looking *before* quit/get fired... Whatever government ‚Äúallows‚Äù Liberty you? It‚Äôs exact fucking opposite. dislike war. enemy nation soldiers borders killing 2,000 civilians every day, better believe I'd want federal government intervene. war, vaccine best weapon. large company already that. assume many  made fuck around stage, time see find works. ""media"" definitely talks it. media likely learned it. US base health recommendations UK. UK also recommend flu shot general population.  logic correct?

2 paid days get vaccinated?

4 Days coordinate correctly family member?

This mandate. It‚Äôs paying people get vaccinated. would good deal held make good daily rate. I'm going assume employer subject ADA (if less 15 employees apply).

I think make formal disability accommodation request writing keep copy request. request include letter doctor documenting health issue explaining vaccine would unsafe him. guess would resolve it.

if still refuse receiving accommodation request writing, mention contacting equal employment opportunity commission request mediator help figure solution. goal mediator help two sides come agreement, also prerequisite suing them. employers want deal mediator, since means they'll open lawsuits, hopefully willing discuss alternative arrangement like regular testing wearing n95.

obviously, bring reporting EEOC getting mediator unless they're unresponsive issues. equivalent bringing ""big ordinance,"" making formal accommodation request ADA proper procedure.

I bring EEOC get accommodations one time, supervisors blatantly illegal things human resources responded telling supervisor important since worked longer. definitely yet getting things writing help clear misunderstandings.  know 14 million looking decent pay jobs. planning take trip *after* recover? make difference far nurse inserts probe PCR test? wife horribly sick today. rapid test performed today indicated covid, pcr test performed Tuesday negative. nurse Tuesday test barely inserted probe nostrils. symptoms day nearly bad today. (We're vaccinated btw)

Was early get ""brain probed""? Wanting trust future tests. mean alternative literal apocalypse insane. knew Jersey labor friendly state ... Wow! executive branch gets decide employs business with. OSHA implement regulations keep employees workplaces safe. thus another ""Boss Babe"" born. Quitting job libz us still unemployed COVID ü•≤but got vaccinated half year ago...

hopefully odds work favor.  Another thing conservatives like do: lie.  Businesses relieved. mandate absolved responsibility. Real businesses stupid. want sick dying workers. get you‚Äòre coming (and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre 100% serious) don‚Äòt need give reasons get tested. free accessible. want know they‚Äòre positive. even common courtesy let others know. failure rests social media groups complicit spread misinformation

You make good points. misinformation everywhere. web. way police fact check even fraction it. Ultimately, us critical thinkers vet information carefully. Unfortunately, penalty many buy misinformation death. put right unemployment benefits turned off... medical procedures forced.

Employers fined ensuring safe healthy workplace employees. lmao wtf reply omggg

You're league homie. stop. read news left work cackled like super villain parking lot. Trump would Trump branded ivermectin sale website necessary protect teachers.  It'll like flu shots. Cheap free, available every pharmacy - even grocery store. Thank effort bring common sense thread. Reddit... filled bots, shills, angsty teenagers. representative average American whatsoever. I've long given trying nuanced discussion anyone around here, sincerely appreciate effort. Thanks again, German bro. dramatic. Sounds like someone either lived extremely privileged live someone can‚Äôt even define dictatorship. Paid time actually big deal low-wage workers cannot afford take day vaccine side effects. coworkers loudly threaten quit this. I'm like""BYE! missed"". Someone else vaccinated gladly take decent paying job good benefits.  agree  date choice would technically wrong merit leaving Earth would considered leaving orbit. Apollo 8 launched 21DEC1968 left Earth orbit first time.  clue account fact case rates higher places vaccination rates lower.

""LA LA LA CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!"" Don‚Äôt forget Zayden.  Damn, I'd totally vote person honorable.   It‚Äôs path chosen follow. think it‚Äôs possible note insanity preventable death appreciating tragedy. 

Ppl see see someone probably spread wealth misinformation, perpetuating pandemic hell live ppl like her. going happen without mandate. Employers would eventually get tired employing people repeatedly sick choice unvaccinated would end harder justify financially. Yeah bro agree minimum wage hire pay welfare people forced work survive what‚Äôs point  Supreme Court ruled permissable 100 years ago.  too! think there‚Äôs two things going on: first, terms executive overreach, you‚Äôre forgetting branch. courts arbiters legality federal judiciary whole fairly conservative ‚Äì top especially so. meet skeptical audience possible there. terms admin costs, they‚Äôre prohibitive equally burden companies size. Call leg truly small business. It‚Äôs called [constructive got once, but, sure would apply here. I‚Äôm expert, but, government making vaccine requirement that‚Äôs reason quit, don‚Äôt think counts IMO. Go check conservative sub announcement. legitimately think going cause civil unrest collapse society. 

I'm American doesnt concern me, absolute lack critical thinking people sub mind boggling always say side lacks critical thinking, think they're told think... get opinions echo chambers fringe sources. honestly terrifying see people talk like that. Like need legitimate mental help. upper brass lifetime government employees nominated hired Marty Walsh democrat. upper management OSHA definitely vaccine friendly, actively support encourage them. guess yes regarding mandate impacting employees work home. seems like applies every employee. 

I think federal contract part pretty broad too. company relatively small team work federal government. drop bunch trainings events Trump banned CRT training. also follow affirmative action diversity requirements. assuming federal vaccine requirement hit us (i.e. testing option). Reminds Marjorie Taylor Green harassing David Hogg, Parkland shooting survivor.  don‚Äôt remember large hadron collider explosion? Maybe reading Berenstain Bears time. even kind here. federal government seized supplies equipment hospitals bolster federal stockpile, want distribute states. pregnant women?? liberty look another job smaller company pay get tested every week. See, personal liberty involve getting people sick! didn‚Äôt go hospital sick, wouldn‚Äôt care. callous sounds, I‚Äôm done.    weekly testing ""overreach"". Please explain detail. discriminating based protected status matter.

If HIV STD impacted job safety they'd rights fire well. Fortunately STDs curable I'm unaware job HIV treated impacts ability work.

You understand employment law know count legal discrimination. do, they‚Äôll calling social services crying they‚Äôre entitled everything pay even though actively put position They‚Äôre idiots. lack basic critical thinking skills.  too!

And sweet. gift gets closer living richer life again. fun itself, enables fun. Like warm coat lets run around outside snow play instead peering window inside. Australia lockdown moment. people pro vaccine easily see 90% people aged 12 getting vaccine becomes available pertinent demographic. small vocal group anti covid vacc.

Given USA able contain genie time, see able introduce sort discipline takes control virus. Soon federal directive claim states rights. Why?

The Supreme Court ruled permissable 100 years ago.  mandatory weekly testing ""over line""? Christian Scientists get religious exemption, [per century, denomination counseled respect public health authorities conscientious obedience laws land, **including requiring hand, practice isn‚Äôt dogmatic thing. Church members free make choices life-decisions, **in obedience law, including whether vaccinate children**. aren‚Äôt decisions imposed church. blame China well?  gotten lost slippery slope    Let's perfectly clear here: US government, regardless happens power time, fucking *lousy*. awful. rarely much truly right, they've gotten good mopping messes (at expense, course).

This thing mishandled since day one, get significantly better Biden took over.

And fact *active political civil war* help matters one fucking bit. Yeah. We‚Äôre little oasis Bend, don‚Äôt travel far inundated ignorance. TMI, last time flu, every time threw up, stuff came ends body. flu absolutely miserable. think people think flu nothing haven‚Äôt ever adult life think have.   Good. want people serving capacity. son entering workforce. Win-win.  Private company anything want. Completely different compare federal government making company something.   Supreme Court ruled permissable 100 years ago. Anything make scared happy. That's keep ramping violence, they're violent they've radicalized systematically decades. Since impacts 100 million Americans, must all.    hero need.  happened ""we together?""

""If want live society, responsibility contribute society."" moral contract born America country. People sit around day read books, sit around playing video games getting high. people contribute society, responsibility anyone anything? get choice born society.

What‚Äôs wrong tomorrow dose one?   use desk PC gaming work issue all. 8 5 done.   Long term 3 years. I'm sorry put that. Weight protected class. fired it. Literally everything say wrong verifiable first Google result.  lying try damage public health is.

But already could tell unvaccinated fake clearly linked get antivax sub. surprised you. mom broke rib coughing hard long bronchitis. awful.  deemed permissable Supreme Court 100 years ago.  friend said, ""ventilator cause double pneumonia"". ( friend died recently covid blame ventilator ""covid flu"").

So nope, anti vaxxer wont get vaccine. influencer even death loved one change mind. better off. Sorry friend. doesn‚Äôt. 

Reddit covid safety, comes mandate people freak out. 

Forcing vaccines good. people don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good them, need get vaccine cost.  I'm worried precedent almost half country believing politicians doctors matters life death healthcare... home, kind surveillance employed monitor do.

But also, get work done irrelevant. manager bitching things like phone use, break time, etc. boomer idiot lowers team's productivity.

Even remote work norm, told in-office team never show up. even though salaried 40 hour work weeks, could give two fucks work 10 minutes per day disappear month long work gets done.

The result every employee working 40+ hours week never issues attendance work quality.

Hire people thrive little management, hire people need micromanagement. really simple  Good.  doubt Biden's cognitive decline allow finish term, let alone run second term. That's good know know that. doc advised getting shot since I'm treating lyme disease.  people forgot motherfucking hepatitis exists. I've tested vaxxed years live jobsite.

Yup, lies issue job... like pretty much everything world, 2 people interpret everything way. Ah OK thanks. Yes, employer sort exception form (I assumed medical/religious exception).

Being obese presenting clear present danger ripple kill 100s thousands others transmission.

Yeah reservations got Supreme Court. Trump judges fucking nuts. Good. work vulnerable population, one can‚Äôt vaccinated themselves, vaccinated it‚Äôs fully approved.  one scratching head USPS workers expempt? Seems fishy me. Big true. saying get vaccinated stop spread sister vaccinated got it... protect her... get give vaxed, know person gave vaccinated also. somehow found vaccinated person spread her, would still murderer? okay vaccines vaccinate nowadays? see hypocrisy right? keeps getting better MRNA $450‚Ä¶..April 2020 mid $30‚Äôs. Plus booster like stock split‚Ä¶.nice. Nope. would blame entire country something came one person. would blame another country one live handled WAY worse even simplest shit slow spread. would blame another country blindsided virus, country months prep time yet president claimed hoax, politicized science, convinced everyone pretend exist still do. 

You blame 200 car pileup one bad driver. took 197 idiot drivers following close. Simple logic. surprised. assholes know jack shit like whine get they're share attention.

My hypocrite sister law got vaccine want quarantine Hawaii vacation. months back yapping harmful vaccines  Great jobs rest us.

The thing people putting permanent poverty. already mentioned. wife mutual friend also preggers 2020. also work health care. Preggers ladies right floor hospital baby oven. got vaccinated pretty much soon available us. posturing makes little sense me. Everything said vaccine complete bullshit spouted people field know they're talking about. dumbasses make arguments something mean arguments hold iota weight employer already ask questions health. HIPPA states medical provider can‚Äôt disclose personal information. Health status isn‚Äôt protected class generally employer allowed ask able meet certain medical guidelines allow job safely. may thinking FMLA protections protect getting fired already job get sick someone family gets sick. But, asking whether you‚Äôre vaccinated illegal. requiring answer illegal especially since unvaccinated could effect ability job safely could impact ability keep employees customers safe. 

The way could see violation law way contracting passing covid others job. strictly work home jobs everything via email phone call zero live human interaction would ones might illegal require vaccination weekly covid test. 

I wish people would actually read HIPPA spouting bullshit applies. employer well within legal rights ask require proof vaccination. well within rights say I‚Äôd rather give you. refuse, certainly terminate employment. FMLA would protect sick sick family member forced miss work certain amount time. could also require work make reasonable accommodations continue job injured ill. But, covid virus spread coworkers like wildfire B short lived symptoms people, protect long get doctor sign work something like 12 weeks. that, either able get back work meet requirements may set vaccination find new job. medical conditions clear 12 weeks specifically listed FMLA guidelines. 

Here‚Äôs link simply list limited number people bound HIPPA. Incentives obese include making healthy foods affordable accessible working eliminating food deserts (this achieved growing food people live instead continuing use traditional farming methods trucking produce everywhere,) bringing wages belong working class people need work 3 jobs make ends meet.  
 
 üíØ Total agreement. Tell mom whose brother killed drunk driver. 

Do ever think beyond bubble? SMH say matter. lot high risk adults. kind screwed half population dimwits. I'd advise moving area high vaccination rate. Otherwise screwed community care (or high risk person, even many family members matter). half hour... career shouted me. agreed it.  government ran areas though.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

I‚Äôm totally OK Get ready USPS implode holiday package season.  That's essentially thing though. I'm also opposed particular case fuck masks lockdowns, want get back normal, at-will employment weakened unions we've allowed employers basically become petty tyrants control personal lives way people fear government doing. argument making. We're taking advantage oppressive nature capitalism try end pandemic mean defending it. Yup, chances +5 every state. IMHO, several factors- baby boomers retiring, rocket companies hiring anyone snatch anti-vaxxers cut. industry including rocket aerospace desperate good talent paying well. Look startups offering future stock options want shot retirement late 40s. Probably heard early numbers quick rollout later numbers showing huge drop off.

And media often switches % total population % adults/eligible population. numbers look good one way terrible another. like -England thinking everything fine -frustrates media. It‚Äôs ok, US much bigger problem people actively avoiding reality England does. Throw em jail. Vax condition getting out.

Checkmate, protesters.  Except it‚Äôs not. 

The vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop getting virus. 

The virus doesn‚Äôt stop mutating vaccine.

""The CDC acknowledged vaccines prevent spread delta variant, comprises nearly 100% current cases. declining effectiveness vaccines premise requiring vaccinated people masked push booster shots. Instead, agency emphasizes people vaccinated reduce risk hospitalization death. However, Israel, one world's fully vaccinated nations, COVID cases among vaccinated. U.K. last month, 40% cases received least one shot.""   way OSHA regulations enforced. might get way someone snitches there's audit they'll get slammed fines. Scary many ppl ok (and celebrate) fed exercising powers have. everyone remember Donald Trump? making ppl reconsider new powers executive acquiring? Yes. anyone know employees already covid tested weekly? would get vaccine? maybe antibody test? long antibodies covid? Yep I‚Äôm right them. Healthcare reform single payer system juuuust bit complex requiring government employees get vaccinated. always legal ability mandate condition employment. get free vaccine! safe effective! \o/ Cancelled plane tickets see grandma nursing home locked due Rona. I'm heartbroken. thinking get shot simply spin new story head fuels rage. 76 miles Houston ‚Äî home world's largest medical complex 85 different hospitals ‚Äî Kakli can't find transfer hospitals find overwhelmed COVID patients.

Doesn't sound like patients' wait times would better ERs around state. [The U.S. Long Precedent Vaccine  Wow quoting doc story.

This part seems pretty clear... Court explained: ""The liberty secured Constitution United States every person within jurisdiction import absolute right person be, times circumstances, wholly freed restraint. manifold restraints every person necessarily subject common good. basis, organized society could exist safety members.""

But IANAL. generally want understand directly applicable current situation / establish precedent. People want vaccine, fine - let get sick die.

Problem overflowing health care system, even people vacced need hospital care issues going ones dying unvacced taking beds.    need fear, Long COVID get covidiots. may missed literature seen facts vaccines prevent/decrease transmission transmission rates. Luckily, Congress passed law delegating power Federal Congress declares purpose policy, exercise powers regulate commerce among several States foreign nations provide general welfare, assure far possible every working man woman Nation safe healthful working conditions preserve human resources --

by providing medical criteria assure insofar practicable employee suffer diminished health, functional capacity, life expectancy result work experience;  eligible US population 70% well. Idek expect us them, miracle cure. WMD needed paid two days work missed got vaccine. employer problem pushing vaccine everyone got sick needed day two recover whole together thing kind disappeared  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still un-American‚Äù

Personally, don‚Äôt want graves full children died vaccine could save lives.

Maybe make argument hospitals overflowing patients rationing care? Jesus flat earther? Right healthcare system getting destroyed. Covid patients taking essentially every bed hospital, leaving regular vaxxed people recourse accidents / injuries / illnesses. People dying can't get hospital. Hospitals calling national guard nurses dropping like flies due mental burnout dealing many people dying/ suffering covid. Even vaxxed get covid, life jeopardy antivaxxers take lack faith dems deliver disagreement seriousness election. think critical show up.  


It's forget past. Every time recent history one party ""control"" Pres/House/Senate, get bashed next midterms. Beyond dems staying home, which, sure, dozen critical reasons may intensity past, Republicans incredible incentive get vote incredible political talking points get there, mention galvanizing leader huge perceived grievances. Alberta announced late July dropping bunch Covid restrictions, including Aug 16, people tested positive *would required quarantine*. is, opinion, pretty insane. Nowhere else policy, even places like Florida. since reversed particular policy, fact tried quite memorable. They‚Äôll employees quit business suffers cuz workers jobs. really want put position? Seems intentional me. Last year riots destroyed many businesses covid cases going down. Gee...coincidence? I've already seen lot people used work quit jobs covid testing. spend days bitching Facebook. new round probably knock new jobs got lol. Thank showing Trump lost. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Good. also ineligible unemployment.

So‚Ä¶ seems pretty legitimate me. I‚Äôm trusting doctors.  France pretty cool thing offer citizenship people perform exceptional acts French citizens like [the guy scaled building save agree people get vaccinated risk, getting vaccinated general good idea‚Ä¶.but doesn‚Äôt feel authoritarian? government make get shot, imagine else make do. go calling anti-vaxxer, vaccinated encourage others to, also skeptical giving government power. opinion, Covid biggest power grab Federal government since Patriot Act, don‚Äôt see relinquishing power anytime soon. argument simply this: cost? something chew on, mob likely downvote oblivion. Democrats obsessed Trump even guy longer president 6 months yall keep wet dreams lol  swear, many people post case without reading mechanism think they've dunked antivaxxer they've done ignore objectionable part vaccine mandate red team bad, blue team good. 

Jacobson decision confirmed state could impose vaccine mandate. say federal government could so, much less executive order. Biden really wanted impose mandate, would worked Democrats Congress try sway dozen Republicans vote mandate. that's haaaaard. 

The moment rule published, enjoined federal level Supreme Court strike down, that's bet.   think developed nation gives rabid antivaxxers big political megaphone US gives them. blues clues? work healthcare Oklahoma tell ~25% staff going walk this. talking true believers. people, equivalent mandatory baby raping. Would keep job mandatory baby raping involved?

Which say they're dumb dumbs, fits pattern. shit i've done months like 32 year lol.

but yes fucking rek you. go Reddit get swayed politically far gone even considering independent thought anymore work nursing home, we're planning losing least 50 workers refusing vaccine. mean personally, lot rhetoric right ""use 2nd amendment rights"" people pitch vaccine.

Although I'm aware anyone trying actually thing. murders masks think happened vaccines yet. absolutely open corrected, though, shit crazy there. They‚Äôre probably trash employees people anyway. Wish they'd started working earlier could available fall. people got J+J shot initially able get it?

I bet side effects really knock ass, better multiple times. thought carrot tied stick wiggle carrot front someone like would cat. Lol lot positions require working every day 12 hours, brutal sleep mental health.  Antivaxxers really among worst people world. less risk getting infected transmitting vaccinated. chose accept risk severe COVID getting vaccinated anyone else mitigate risk. That's two options about. someone who‚Äôs vaccinated currently applying jobs, say let ‚Äòem. Gives opportunity get career job. great sounds, need remember OSHA largely toothless, understaffed, they're even able investigate laughably bad. wish OSHA people authority they're pretty weak.

Hopefully real teeth policy. not, fine could $100k per violation matter end. Misleading title. testing mandate - vaccine expansive rules mandate employers 100 workers require vaccinated test virus weekly, affecting 80 million Americans. roughly 17 million workers health facilities receive federal Medicare Medicaid also fully Biden also requiring vaccination employees executive branch contractors business federal government ‚Äî option test out. covers several million workers. people vote anyway. right move Canada, right? didn‚Äôt take appeal tradition see point. need suddenly love it.  think majority America's are, we're spot lesser 2 evils. absolutely sucks, state American politics rn. links share? /r/badlegaltakes think per location, right? mcdonalds might require it?


I can't find clear answer, someone link one ill edit comment it; -- --    Instagram best alternative. Still owned Facebook, near bad Facebook. Let employers set vaccine policy.

That worked. Time step up. people would shut get vaccinated starts losing money. Lol, I've saying that's caused Trump timeline now! thought organized religions antivax, like Christian Scientists. considered ideology? Nailed it. Effective public policy incentivizing behavior want disincentivizing behavior want. policy both.  would require intelligence level absolute zero forsight amoeba. getting paid. Got it. 

I see convalescent leave point though.

But holdouts, nurses professionals get good money (500+) people took free.

Short squeezing vaccine‚Ä¶ Dang.

This makes laugh.  responsibility encouraging choice: Put bed 9, can't that, mandate going bed 8:30. sounds great. Cost products services go tax payers footing bill. makes say that? What‚Äôs specific Texas would make doesn‚Äôt affect you? Hospitals need start turning away un-vaccinated. Let reap sown. he's taking ""the science"" going address science recovered Immunity?  Good luck trying find job lol Thats completely different situation, would based employment contract.

But yes, would argument constructive layoff. Badically, trying force quit. Again, based language contract. Yes, humans animals.

There difference allowed treat actual animals humans though. feel like empty? Congress exists solely block party, executive orders way anything yes, people executive branch work president, hold fine

private employees seriously harm children already struggling massive increase mental health problems - suicides even - well reduced education quality.

From outside (Denmark) perspective, wonder USA increasingly seem resort extremists &amp; divisive positions; forced vaccinations, masks children, closing schools, etc. seems work better measured approach Scandinavia. large hadron collider explosion caused us live alternate timeline

Is right get sick? I'd get mrna dose. know safe effective (likely effective vaccine combo). Give nasally.  ""my anecdote indicative America"" case however, don‚Äôt cheat get ahead. government tries take right away, cheating trying use authority rightfully theirs. Shit going hit fan. lost identity 2016. trying offend, honest question genuinely trying figure asked others, one seems really know. industry work still unemployed COVID? Everything seems opened back up. people unemployed due COVID still? I‚Äôm talking people chose ride unemployment expired, mean certain industries never opened back up? Ruin everything it.

Plus boosters elderly I‚Äôm sure come winter help stop hospitalized breakthrough cases. I'm pregnant want know.... got mine March anti-vax nurses going love this.

I care love. They've proven time opinion worth listening to. Eh, does, significant. childhood vaccines, example, multiple diseases. MMR = measles, mumps, rubella. TDaP = tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis. recall kids getting multiple injections visit, vaccines combined single shot administered different shots. Exactly - want punch neighbor face trying argue getting covid despite vaccinated proves vaccine doesn‚Äôt work.    Let‚Äôs say Americans all. Pros: vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded

Cons: people quitting jobs avoid vaccine 


While increased vaccination rate slow spread decrease number hospitalizations, thereby decreasing unsustainable load failing healthcare system, move may also trigger wave resignations workforce time labor already short supply. 

Diregarding moment arguments around freedom choice role government lives, question is: mandate net positive effect society? anticipated decrease hospitalizations outweigh potential decrease labor force?

Consider also compounding effects labor shortage ( yes, know actually wage shortage) already fractured supply chain. 

Additionally, much benefit actually see mandate (when) vaccine resistant variant covid begins dominate?

I'm asking know answer, I'm hinting suggesting one way other. would appreciate thoughts insights subject. I'm sure checked lawyers announcing it. found Biden ask Department Labor issue rule requiring employers 100 employees ensure workforce fully vaccinated produce negative Covid test least week, said senior administration official. requirement could carry $14,000 fine per violation would affect two-thirds country's workforce, official fuck 'em, tried nice that. There's smart places full anti-vaxxers.

But Idaho National Lab, lot nuclear engineering research, sub 50%. research effectiveness monoclonal antibodies fully vaccinated people? guess would useful immunocompromised others?  Tens thousands seconds. Millions milliseconds. Smh they're spreading COVID misinformation, they're helping. Idaho full fuds hate fucking state. Maybe hospitalization example:

No-one questioning doctors prescribing corticosteroids Fluvoxamine, anti-depressant suspected helping treat covid symptoms.

I'll make sure remind October 4th, 2021 though.  quite Delta employees affect. Many retired military already use switch tricare. Others spouses companies get insurance there. former military ones understand least. required get numerous vaccinations throughout careers. hope tricare refuses cover anyone catches covid vaccinated. sad (according article) full 25% Delta employees unvaccinated, find hard believe many alternate insurance options. Stronger measures needed. Sounds like Southern states entitled, anything. Meh, sounds like people vaccinated. want run elsewhere someone foolish. hate professionals. stuck listening ""unprofessionals"". People think vaccine make worse variants? people come conclusion? How??  ""Every man sociable ~~cow~~ COVID invades garden."" can, they're much less likely to. even less likely top people around vaccinated. Ivermectin isn‚Äôt harmful proper dosages. Yup, India needed something shut up. summer coming take action. wait acceptable. Lol would run local bus service? Yep Israel similar numbers

The gov something claim agree mad threy another thing wanted? 

Lol, miserable life work overtime finding reason hate ideas even agree with. 

Lololol dunno, part mobile testing site, respect nurses more. working two jobs, working studying. One master's degree equivalent (a nurse practitioner?) super knowledgeable everything going on. also two jobs, one ICU.

And top that, matter 30 degrees 110 degrees (F) full PPE, sometimes use plastic gowns Texas summer, ten hours day (on rotating shifts. people get heat stroke hour, eventually cut 30 minutes, even though PPE needed disposed time shortage).

You know, got fair point, though, couple nurses vocal wanting get vaccine. thing remember different grades nurses, given theoretical education, get blue collar practical knowledge.

The less educated nurses basically went long trade school learned basic stuff without fucking up, constantly bitching right. it, rote memorization procedure. gotta stick swab someone's nose, find sinus cavity, swirl around mining boogers 15 seconds, immediately place sample tube, put tube bag, etc etc. rocket science, need know tbh overwhelmed work, school, family spend time reading trial studies vaccines. wonder defines violation? per employee comply? per week company comply? Mega fucked, cuz quit jobs health insurance, get Covid, die horrible avoidable death, saddle families ton debt, survive watch families suffer financial burden stupidity. many vaccinated people actually dying?

To even let slightest doubt in‚Äîor even let something go unchallenged‚Äîis begin engaging ego death.   experience, people vaccine privileged ""me me"" selfish people. principled want go protest strike anything requires work courage. least straight admit using slipper slope logical fallacy Europe vaccine passports used means overtake us vaccine % even though well behind multi-level marketing companies make killing signing women up. #BossBitch So, believe George Washington dictator?

By Timothy Leadership.  people receive governments welfare (Medicaid, FAFSA, Student loans, food stamps, SSI, etc). want penetrate populations vaccination, areas good places fill gaps. Typical idiot thought pattern. care effects me. ‚ÄúUnprecedented infringement personal freedom‚Äù

History says something else. 80% fully vaccinated, still seeing huge spike cases.. why?

- vaccinations less effective Delta. There‚Äôs multiple studies effectiveness around 60-90%, depending study.

- Delta extremely contagious compared Alpha it‚Äôs spreading rapidly unvaccinated communities 

- People become relaxed fully vaccinated

- plus side hospitalisation rate fully vaccinated vs unvaccinated 0.9% vs 6.5%. 0.9% though still bit risky fully open yet. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), United States Supreme Court case Court upheld authority ***states*** enforce compulsory vaccination laws. Right, pushes people take vaccine, worth it. I'm sure though. American's messed country times, could see large amount people rejecting even never grew rebel phase. think health care professionals refusing get vaccinated lose licensure, losing job nearly enough penalty. want prevent able get another job field all. turn fox news entertainment. aren‚Äôt churning high quality talking points you. need like 90% deaths far active Republican voters, cover loss quantity Democratic voters. Nice.  concerned we‚Äôve already hundreds years good results?  hope enough morons follow reasonable people take advantage get better jobs. supposed get antibody treatment getting hospitalized. qualify fired cause quit. basically apies layoffs. cause content scenarios doesn‚Äôt mean precedent applies. IANAL SCOTUS saying state authority far different department labor rights haven't? maybe (medical problems,etc) won't? insane Yall canceled. smallpox. people complaining people want work. 

Spoiler alert: None actually quit. vote green party. Jill Stein fit bill 100% mandated Pfizer vaccine fully approved FDA weeks ago. think expect people medicial field geniuses. they‚Äôre regular people though, smart, not. establishment OSHA also act Congress. 

My point federal government long history regulating workplace issues variety things. last one found interesting :   We‚Äôve finally peaked Missouri, think. round, anyway. Honest questions. 100 employees? employers less 100 less venerable? legal ramifications employers 100+ employees subjecting too? exempt personal injury lawsuits vaccine causes injury disability?

this webpage seems pretty good know nothing it: [EMPLOYEES' PRACTICAL GUIDE REQUESTING NEGOTIATING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AMERICANS DISABILITIES big thing agree specific accommodation ask for, still supposed come accommodation works you, even employee's first choice. would get vaccinated even need fucking masks.

If fuckheads worn fucking mask told year ago, might needed fucking vaccine bad.

Interesting bit link: president (Trump), instance, said March 17 discussed ‚Äúa national lockdown‚Äù advisers minimize spread COVID-19, three days later dismissed idea. say centralized federal response would effective needed, **any executive order effect would unprecedented would likely lead court challenge constitutional grounds.** (emphasis added)

While State governments broad authority enact quarantines, President via Executive Order may unconstitutional. little doubt going end courts. Given makeup current Supreme Court, may go well. 

While I'm vaccine mandate, also believe strongly rule law. Biden President, King. cannot whatever wants fiat, even likely right thing do. mandate needs pass Constitutional muster. see administration may argue falls Commerce Clause; however, clause gives Congress power, Executive. really leaves President declaring emergency claiming vaccine mandate Emergency power. Though again, that's likely end Supreme Court, may sympathetic claim. 

The Federal workers Contractors bit easy defend purview. But, I'll kinda surprised private business part makes Courts unscathed. Meanwhile third world countries, queue hours chinese vaccine order get back work‚Ä¶ Bro get choices throughout school. got dozens vaccines. Imagine thinking sway people mocking emojis fear going affect smaller medical programs. visit nursing homes job &amp; ones aren‚Äôt coporate owned employ 100 people. anti-vax nurses aides going end smaller businesses, possibly around vulnerable populations.

I work huge global corporation; gonna shoot email tomorrow morning? happens don‚Äôt? solve anything, promotes propaganda. 

Even fully vaccinated right things, certainly get infected transmissible. 

It's definitely unvaccinated spreading this. we're this, single biggest vax demographic that's reluctant get jabs African American community (just around 40% vaxxed, White 50%, Asiatic 67%). 

So basically told going take jobs submit orders old white man, surrounded whites comply, they'll even lose healthcare. 

Meanwhile, adding thousands people mix Afghanistan, let's forget practically open southern border MANY caught crossing testing positive covid. 

This administration fuckawful. 

I tell something. creating even divisive stance country, lead division. 

Certainly one anti vax even vaccine hesitant going listen ""message"" think, know, I'm gonna forget previous stance get jab. 

In fact, given recent global events lies perpetuated, day trust government, locally globally, time low.

First all, getting COVID give natural immunity, immunity mean can't contract COVID catching identical getting vaccine. People COVID still need get vaccinated.

U.S. saw car deaths stay steady, due less crowded roads leading higher speed, deadlier crashes. India , confirm Delta , Delta Plus , Kappa Epsilon absolutely give flying fuck side spectrum 
They came , saw , killed 
Don't let happen guys .. arm chance folks! 
Good luck :D would assume underlying conditions associated lungs, heart anything pulmonary, take extra steps protect yourself. agree. I‚Äôm willing get tested every week spite. die die, enough said. they'll post Twitter ""huh, bad thought"". Moderna developing Combo shot covid booster+flu vaccine! development though, guess available next year. Oh worries, COBRA super affordable.

^/s Yeah hoping too. work way many morons state building. BASED!!!! BASED!!!!! BASSSSSEDDDDD!!! took month see primary, three months get MRI. US. waited 8 hours ER covid. I‚Äôve there.  people dumb box hammers  Good thing live texas number quote ER doctor. Wait times literally counted minutes. Despite 76 miles Houston ‚Äî home world's largest medical complex 85 different hospitals ‚Äî Kakli can't find transfer hospitals find overwhelmed COVID ""I tried get best cancer hospital world also Houston take her,"" Kakil told CBS News' David Begnaud. said wait times hospitals' emergency rooms **""You would never see four digits minutes since checked in. We're 4 digits, thousands minutes, we've never seen this, ever, ever,"" Kakli said.**  soon though? I‚Äôm worried month two northern states late. state plateaued low rate it‚Äôs still hard find home tests. fuckers said that's sound kidney stone. fucked people forced save people's lives.    ...or put legit reason so.

So lot lies coming HR department, eh?

I'm boat you. go Tuesday thanks morning internet outage home. Almost everyone office vaccinated. still mask time young kids. requiring people get vaccinated, go small company, get tested every week, start business, unemployed, many options. Oh damn, bunch boomers retiring bc anti vax beliefs vacating jobs next generation? mandate sounds better better. wear N95 mask anytime inside public building near large crowds. 

&amp;#x200B;

This go would require morally consistent, aren‚Äôt. politics literally ‚ÄúI hate women minorities‚Äù used live legal beat wife ""to correct her"" long stick thicker thumb, held Holy Quran arm administered beating.

I never tested out.  watched video news adults removed meeting. \o/ WOoooooooo!!!! Yeah, OSHA part specifically bothers me. Federal employees following federal rules makes sense applying virtually employees right. nah.. conservatives losing lives ICUs right that's horse paste they're eating. *We want enjoy benefits society, interest contributing it.* 

\- Way many Americans. Hospitals overflowing unvaccinated people, making everyone else get denied care. 

It high time mandate comes through. unvacced killing themselves, hurting others. Got it. like 500k IRA 10 shares Pfizer individual stock he‚Äôd need recuse? Seems bit craz haha rights

wut  supreme court ruled vaccine mandates legal. announcement federal employee, contractor, healthcare worker required get vaccinated find another job. work private sector choice get tested weekly instead. I'd rather get vaccinated get with.

Freedoms absolute especially actions affect others. Giving freedoms part living society.  Better preserving dead stick virus, no? companies want mandate vaccines let it, force every company it.

Disagree. would like letting individual businesses decide want use licensed plumbers electricians want store food certain temperature. leave businesses make decisions going cause lot unnecessary deaths send many hospital. catch Covid unsafe workplace, entitled worker's comp.. OSHA rule removes ambiguity makes safe workplace wrt Covid. 

Besides. unvaccinated people get sick Covid far far exceeds people serious adverse reaction. Well difference. much think people really getting vaccinated little disingenuous say difference vaccines dealing right now. living time textbooks.  
We need people get vaccinated, I'm proud member #Pfizergang still want force people it. School requirements seem normal though. absolutely nothing?

him absolutely nothing would *fantastic*. let CDC handle **DISEASE CONTROL LITERALLY NAME AGENCY**. couldnt admit anyone knew *anything* him, hampered much could, spouting random fever dream ""cures"", boned chance re-election process. thankful one things.  two sentences seem inconsistent. workers get vaccinated less likely get COVID therefore less labor shortage  Ya fuck medical issues can't get vaccine. still relevant shows importance vaccines.

Eventually always trickles civil population, point now. research seems always end catch covid. Suspicious Swimming good inside say chlorine kills everything. saying good. one things kills covid. debating someone doesn‚Äôt evidence. asking debate uneducated opinion? suppose could that‚Ä¶you overreacting acting like child.  company hq one areas. idiots vocally antivax including owner. shy 100 employees though. Dammit Schools FUball too.

Seriously, 50,000 people pack college stadium game city shoulder shoulder, yelling, ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù required wear masks, vaccination required, eating/drinking concession food. work large tech company, month ago, announced financial carrot vaccinated end year. wonder new directive affect carrots payout . . . real cringe one Dr. Joseph Mercola, famous anti-vax osteopath, must serious damage whole profession (osteopaths today whole different ""regular"" physicians, distinction shrouded vagaries medical history must hard explain layperson) water wet Imagine Biden's legacy saving bunch Republicans will. fire State funding hospitals comes Medicaid supplemental programs, mostly funded Federal matching funds. Hospitals choice medicare Medicaid bread. Unless federal courts find anything unconstitutional. many people arch/eng field vaccine??

I've met tons engineers anti-vaxx even COVID, think they're smart... smart smarter scientists. think decision similar withdraw Afghanistan- rushed. realize mandate come online yet could change lots enforcement. Biden realize large population anti vax get vaccine mandate. started requiring military, police, gov workers, risk civilians (like people 70), sports events patrons, people sending kids school, ... got everyone. Turing millions American day dumb. could easily say fat people

No, could not. hospital turn away people treatment surgery obese people overwhelmed system way unvacced covid patients are. vaccines stop transmission.

It's black white. Vaccinated much lower rates transmission unvaccinated people. 

Getting many people safe effective vaccine best way combat pandemic get back normal. I‚Äôm saying giving example George Washington mandating something similar situation irrelevant military requirements. Jokes think can. Tbh last thing economy needs class divide poverty. see that's already led us... Everybody seems miss it‚Äôs ‚Äúvaccine unemployed‚Äù. option weekly testing unvaccinated employees mainly use post pics dog friends see, lol.      lockdown made people lose jobs?  WOAH

That's **awesome**! happen? iirc covid vaccine qualify that, may date since Pfizer fully approved since then. still leaves two probably covered.  can't believe many nurses anti-vax. dad doctor convince many nurses get vaccine, still not. kids least flu even less dangerous Case point! Let show true colors, then. I'm tired minority holding rest us hostage. think may overestimating amount people willing die hill avoid vaccine, don‚Äôt understand insane people‚Ä¶you may right. think people living allowing hospitals function properly significantly important economic disruption. cares takes rich white ladies extra week get lotion Amazon. Yes since everyone doesnt coverage expensive. Disappointed applies COVID vaccines. apply big ones that, say, school college would require. Oh flu vaccine too! working people need financially support retired people. people squirreling away massive 401ks waiting go retirement spending spree. China ended 1 child per couple rule, working well realized run economic issues big retired population compared working. Hope door doesn‚Äôt hit ass way ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  done friday.  agree mandatory flu shots I‚Äôd concerned think covid crossed line mandate needed much like polio small pox example Biden waited till unemployment hookup start forcing vaccine employee's throats!

Update resumes! Bout 2 openings! No, no, no, protest, remember protesting bad people do. also realized recently. months ago, understood phrase mean tie carrot stick dangle front someone order lead want go.

I'm 39.  Mine way. lot family antivax unfortunately. Thankfully though, dad mentioned he‚Äôll get shot means job requires it. Hoping soon. repercussions companies refuse comply? Sounds intelligent. paid*  Schrodinger's Shit? *clapping* *cheering noises* advise get fucked Wait, American? Then... People choose, get weekly test would matter gives something rally against? gotten vaccine yet they're probably going unless forced. There's point penalizing people gotten vaccine idiots might keep idiots. I'm done giving shit. can't let minority loudmouth idiots hold rest us hostage. Biden chosen confrontation. would culpable sat back let pandemic get worse. happened civil liberties. Funny government mandate can‚Äôt mandate police reform, voting rights, universal single payer healthcare can't wait go back working home   Aye! Slippery slope.

More people falls break hips winter; stay home order. state laws preventing private businesses exercising federal rights? people legitimately hesitant waiting FDA approval vaccines, understand, still infuriates me. However, least people, they're jumping board (most them). Israel still example everyone references? vaccination rate middle pack last checked much better USA There‚Äôs cases people asked put mask inside store leave come back shoot retail employee. It‚Äôs isn‚Äôt common, even one time many. Antivaxxers need chill fuck stop drinking kool aid. I'm similar situation, working good organization good benefits plus zero layoffs/shutdowns/furloughs beginning pandemic I'm really surprised number people going nope shot. ‚ÄúWell mandate vaccine, guess I‚Äôll Dude‚Ä¶really?

imagine everyone likes take experimental genetic therapy, anyway need shots year

Nope already established government mandate vaccines case Spanish flu. Bro country people still think earth flat Jesus white man. Yeah, feel like game who's going blink first. However, deadline rapidly approaching Biden ever say that? everyone listened health experts would vaxxed would issues. explanation I‚Äôve used. parents ask put bed 9pm. continue refuse comply, stop asking start mandating. 

If power grab government conspiracy theorists like claim, would‚Äôve started mandating immediately. never would choice. conservatives wanted bratty children, they‚Äôre gonna get treated like bratty children. Oh Ok. Thanks.  mass vaccination won‚Äôt end pandemic, nothing (besides everybody catching Covid getting immunity old fashioned way is). post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
