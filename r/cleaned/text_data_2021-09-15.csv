The chest pains worse stayed waited 20+ hours seen. told leave calling doctor finding medical history. kept pulling back run stress tests, blood work, etc. Finally take back triage room (where intake check basics like blood pressure, temp, evaluate symptoms) tell sorry, have. 1am finally get clean, open ER room. Turns verge stroke, artery like 80% closed stint put in. could've died waiting room. Dublin easily worst public transport capital cities Europe. terrible non-existent rest country. Florida Texas let insult stand. bureaucracy ridiculous. So, Friday FDA say whether boosters OK, need wait sometime next CDC discuss decide actually qualifies boosters. I'm nearly 9 months out. nuts. hospital would prefer vaccinated. family member wait 12 hours get surgery (Canada) covid last year time hospitals overwhelmed. Horrible. 5-6 hours admitted given pain meds irony. makes impotent.  Good luck that. social end rapidly approaching kids get vaccinated. okay, thank you!

The infection rate US date 12.6% (41.6M/330M) 

Which means total death rate 0.2% average.

Viruses one 'goal', reproduce make viruses. kill hosts quickly, means less time reproduce spread given host. best case scenario disease become chronic host without killing - free ride, were.

That strong evolutionary pressure. Mutations favor killing host, thus increasing ability reproduce - spread hosts - mutations selected for. viruses tend become less deadly time.

Unfortunately, process random haphazard occurs, sometimes mutations make disease deadly (Delta Covid example that). takes time rolling viral dice, over, right mutation happens optimal virus - thus better also host terms survival.

It noted nothing means less deadly also means 'not screwed life'. little evolutionary pressure mess - look polio. invalid must taken care spreads disease effectively right context. 

So, kind hope Covid settle kind less deadly.   got vaccinated, fiancé don’t mind internet asking? Right, nobody ever died flu covid, especially old people people already medical problems.

April 2020 cursing nursing homes enough keep elderly safe (her mother nursing home). all, ""Fuck Cuomo!"" 

This went months. 

Then vaccine came went anti-vaxx tirades. 

Then nursing home started allowing visitors first time year... vaccinated people could visit. 

She lost shit. Claiming abusing mother allowing unvaccinated ass visit...

A month later posting FB sense taste smell. 

Two weeks later elderly father hospital COVID. 

She begging prayers SIMULTANEOUSLY planning PARTY ""when comes home."" 

Three days later announces ""being made comfortable hospice care.""

He's dead (YET) worry, ALREADY STARTED MOTHERFUCKING GOFUNDME funeral expenses... repeat... even dead yet. 


Still get vaccinated. downvotes get say all.

Most posters truly horrible people, however much think hoid guys particulary serve extremely deadly wipes lungs, attacks brains, destroys kidneys generated blood clots body. going lie get shot, man. something he'd ever do. I'm saying closing schools good solution. never is, I'd rather stupid kids dead kids. That's awesome. I'm genuinely sincerely happy you. least somewhere planet getting right. ask dad proof CVS either that's could tell medication list clearly cancer patient  know is, went university big city. got sick like twice year. hotbed viral plague. 

I gotten cold/flu 4 years university. 

I feel like immune system supercharged gaining strong antibodies strains cold flu people catching years probably got body learned deal similar viruses better. 

Is possible rural people exposed less viral pathogens less able defend them? another discussion another day. live Northwest Arkansas, son 9th grade. district one full mask mandates (both students teachers day), 10k students 300 kids quarantined since mid-august. know vac rate can't 60%...fucking masks work. Definitely not, definitely not. Technically kind threats terrorist threats, least them. I've seen pretty violent language toward people promoting vaccination.    Oh man, must hit nerve. Hey, serious. Chill out. part US hospitals fine, covid numbers negligible, life moving on. 

This big fucking country. I’m equivalent Denmark, Mississippi might well Moscow far covid concerned. mask mandates vaccinating children? so, no. yes. imply Chinese see like this. wrong. 

In experience, right. experience might well partial though, confirmed people know live work China well Chinese say China good grip well? 

I literally said opposite...  get card, concerned getting shot, go in, say insurance asked, say id asked. may still get grief, places supposed ask point. dumbass protected constitution. 

Just hurry collect hemain cain award already. covid inevitably fatal disease

You imply Chinese see like this. wrong. countries ""good grip""

Why say China good grip well? honestly think reason they're vaccinate fear virus. probably combination Chinese discipline/adherence, strict government. mean fair...isn't reddit is? doing? Reddit nothing echo chamber everyone thinks viewpoint right one. zero objectivity anywhere Reddit. That’s insane. You’re right. 

It’s two orders magnitude bigger!!! It’s meant complete. 

Ireland still requires vaccine certificates bars restrictions October 22. 

[Ireland drop almost covid-19 restrictions requires vaccination negative test plus quarantine enter. Local limits increased 200 persons people must register sit contact tracing. Masks required observe 1 meter distancing

[icelandair People lying get extra vaccinations delays, need get shit together one feels like that. Delta spreading like wildfire people rightfully scared right now.  member working class time money restaurant.

I grew poor fuck able eat restaurants kid. seems like weird comment. 

You realize affordable restaurants, right? What? need religiously slaughter spike protein ok? among large portion COVID-19 patients—possibly high 30 percent, according estimate U.S. National Institutes Health—who suffer type neurological psychiatric symptoms. Even troubling many individuals, like Davis, cognitive issues linger weeks months initial infection.  year, dozens hospitals healthcare systems across country opened post-COVID clinics help patients admitted intensive care units severe COVID-19. pandemic dragged on, clinics filled people never hospitalised suffer lingering symptoms, including brain fog cognitive issues

It well proven vaccinated individuals reduced chance severe covid symptoms. quite possibly worst lingering symptom one motivate even healthiest people get vaccinated. really depends individual store taking information. I'd try somewhere else. Covid deaths proportionally higher rural populations? They're higher we'd expect?  I'm amazing got high, whole process pretty casual haphazard compared mass-testing. Getting vaxxed based sort vague suggestion everyone kind made time wandered got done. mast testing super organized smoothly managed.  sorry hear mother. definitely believe 1 350 number - point trying make doesn’t mean us personally knows someone died severely impacted (intubated, etc.). guess I’ve lucky Yeah... like masks needed beginning... change, FDA stupid sometimes lives threatened quickly change tunes. happened masks too. Lol no, knew someone would reply like that, case. countries ""good grip"" well population still see covid absolutely horrible inevitably fatal disease. think Norwegians, Kiwis Koreans choose take personal responsibility?

By way, similar dynamic also happened Europe. Italians Spainiards historically far stricter behaviours compared Germans Danes example, cause got traumatized first wave long time viewed covid much severe threat. people saying socialized healthcare? Lines would long? Yes... going (a fairly low - higher numbers there) excess death number. None, crazy people using vagueness doctrine try justify avoiding it. mean look declining birth rates come conclusion ponzi scheme pensions going bad idea.  population still overly afraid covid sees something much dangerous deadly is

Or, know, good grip problems mass deaths causes, choose take personal responsibility trying eradicate it. - Chinese-governmental nudge. case Czech Republic past 5 months. Vaccinated tested. one ever checked it. law one thing, reality depending people right. “There’s misunderstanding ivermectin among us liberals well.”

I don’t think so. 80% friends right around Democratic Party is, I’d describe right center, friends much left. 

If ask “Is ivermectin drug approved human use” would say yes. 

If ask “is ivermectin still used treat diseases humans” would say yes. 

If ask “is evidence ivermectin effective Covid-19”, that’s would say no. 

Most friends also aware difference drugs formulated human use, versus animal use. Many friends use HeartGard dogs combat heart worm, that’s ivermectin. 

A lot friends also understand medicine frequently dosed based body mass. 180 pound human going need different dosage 1,000 2,000 pound horse. 

I don’t think it’s fair characterize “liberals” misunderstanding ivermectin. 

And yes, doctors prescribed ivermectin treat Covid. Especially Latin America. reasonable sounding hypotheses ivermectin might help people fight Covid. evidence, first concern. data kept rolling in, evidence, it’s showing ivermectin significant impact people’s ability fight Covid. 

There new data - - shows things like fluvoxamine may help fight Covid. ivermectin significant impact. Many prior data people pointing to, like Elgazzar study showed ivermectin 90% effective curing Covid, we’re found faked data, plagiarized sections study, duplicate patients double counted slight falsification patient data, etc. Removing one study data, keeping small studies ivermectin, makes data look like impact ivermectin treatment Covid outcomes. 

The majority “Liberals” know read research data, don’t “opinions” ivermectin, except there’s currently evidence ivermectin useful treating Covid, CDC FDA currently don’t recommend ivermectin treat Covid. Vaccinated folks still get infected. Relying government business give money actively making money USA indicates acute lack attention paid things going last 35 years so.  joke Sputnik lower effectiveness vaccines. 

The vaccines available US Europe reduce number infections infected, reduce complications symptoms. 

[study vaccine Sputnik vaccine works problem every European country person schooling? Umm, kinda feels way. like “everyone planet must vaccinated corona disappear; people refuse vaccine sinners” crew

Live let live domestic terrorism treated such. Charge accordingly.   That's difference confirmed positive cases resulting death (1 500) assuming excess deaths attributable covid (1 300). former lower limit. latter likely estimate, maybe much. chance That's healthcare system USA sucks. many Covid patients. affect vaccinated people get breakthrough infections? 8–9 months since start vaccination campaign I’m getting bad feeling going royally fuck up. Nobody harming anyone. That's disagree. 


If others Vaccinated, effected, already recovered, immunity surpassing Vaccines give anyway. 99.98% people age bracket recover. prove last year recovered long got poked 4 months ago.  


**The issue simply believe us inviolable, unbreachable right absolute perfect secrecy privacy choice medical records, choice way impact participate society - never decades this, now**. hold **regardless circumstances wider society.** 


And also : Again, Vaccinated months. philosphical point anything else. 


Sidebar - everyone actually ""participates society"" equal degree - job go too, well, go home spend 12-16 hours PC every night fun, usually gaming. wife, many IRL friends, keep myself. go tot eat anyway, go movie theaters years, live rural area far away hussle bussle larger city. literally keep talk anyone IRL work. 


And finally, again, need hear case natural immunity. Even jabbed (out choice) could proven natural immunity tests. brother caught visiting Texas time (visiting state) managed get visiting. HEB worked 8 employees get including him. recovered mild effects, fact reason know weeks later bought antibodies test, tested poisitive, - vaccinated, certainly after.

I'm personally democratic socialist - agree Biden many things, cannot abide viewpoint mandate, even someone already vaccinated. unvaccinated rate among hospitalized speaks itself. would need hear anything else? Bit mixed bag. Singapore zero cases opening big change. 81% total population jabbed boosters already started 60+. cases exponential thing. 800 plus today. mandates, idiots make issue.  worry less friends family California now. Still sure I'm following complaint post. reporting AAP data. worries though. would lot respect actually advocating universal healthcare. People die Covid know. vaccinated concerned lack hospital space immunocompromised elderly family members event get sick involved accident need care. Unfortunately, many hospitals country full capacity COVID patients refused get FDA-approved vaccine.  could argue caught COVID post-vaccine US severe cognitive deficiencies anyway 

My sympathy goes caught pre-vaccine can't get health reasons. people prioritize months knocking doors neighborhoods Palm Beach County, Florida, trying convince members community get vaccinated, Lisa Wilson said lost six members family Covid-19 three-week span.  work side side communities constantly push message get people vaccinated,"" Wilson explained, ""but convince family members get vaccinated.""  Moreland, Lisa Wilson's uncle, died Covid-19, said. Wilson, aide Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay wife Belle Glade Mayor Steve Wilson, said received call August uncle, Tyrone Moreland, sick going downhill quickly. ""It started uncle. feeling bad. eating, coughing lot,"" said. paramedics transported hospital, discovered ICU bed available.  checking hospitals single bed available Palm Beach County. transport hospital hour half away,"" said.

This direct result poor leadership spread misinformation. Canada already vaccinated 12+.    area. Low rates, especially kids. Really low. Well done, Cali. Proud resident. need drop numbers states well. antibody tests differentiate antibodies Covid vaccine? I’m wondering there’s anyway tell whether vaccinated person asymptomatic Covid. need lot data children complicated adults. bodies developing. 

On top that, hate break you, covid significantly less risky children adults - terms long term impacts, short term impacts, death. turns 1/10,000 children gets sort myocardial health issue vaccine, may worth vaccinating tens millions children - might worse covid. 

Denmark isn’t even bothering vaccinating children 12. Travel still hugely restricted. can’t even go back UK visit due lottery permission enter non PR Citizens worth noting we've known year 'long covid' cause brain problems. article still correct/timely - 'how' case means 'by mechanism'. Work home virtual learning lockdowns could prevented many deaths, PROFITS!!

greed ensure pandemic gets much much worse.

It's shame many greed worshipping folks blind destruction.

Worst ignoring countries using lockdowns protect citizens instead using fodder corporate profiteering. Pretty much said. Speak clearly moronic people know. certainly know anyone ever thought Australia backwards. states vaccine mandates plus mask mandates, cases low compared states pro-covid.  Thank I'm actually OK. like seeing statistics misrepresented suddenly every death even remotely associated fever, cough pneumonia automatically counted covid. provide evidence case? so, would really like see reputable line graph showing deaths covid respiratory issues superimposed, show happened non-covid related deaths.. go? Nobody seems good explanation. way, Fauci dirty AF. ”fun” part foreign post docs US is, spouses allowed work earn additional income. Extra kick face addition small salaries. happening area reasonably high vaccination rates (79% eligible overall). One town outside Seattle sent heads outbreak local high school football game—held outdoors, fully masked due state requirements school property (but food available, unmasked time), area 12-19 age group 89.2% vaxxed.

Fuck know fix shit heart attack victims actually get timely treatment. People remarkably mask compliant part, biggest employers still work home, county whole high vax rate…yet hospitals still swamped. we’re badly spite that, places going Delta surges? STDs thing..lol dipshits ones clogging hospitals. 🖕 people complaining misinformation reddit realise talking people like you? Looks like they're heroes anymore? That’s works ok Efficacy stop breakthrough infections, something vaccines never 100%. Severe disease death seem holding fine due T-cell immunity side, high levels antibodies thing matters.

Yesterday's AMA Vincent Racaniello answered lot matter.  Yeh they're spread virus. Lol? 'It's part God's plan' definitely example too. Sounds like win/win. students seem different priorities anyway... nah live rural california low vax rate COVID. get mocked wearing mask every day work (a fortune 500 company!) grocery store. 

&amp;#x200B;

rural california okay Think much must happening caught. 

We stop every attempt, anti-vaxxers need get single card. asymmetrical battle.

Vaccine mandates use card verification (most them) going significant security breaches.  limited group deserve incentive vaccination got right away?

Where say hesitant getting vaccine deserved bonus. said frontline workers deserved one work done past 18 bonuses paycheck one fighting Covid since begining like doctor nurses like mother got vaccine soon possible worked ass since Day 1 pandemic.

Since saying mother deserves bonus months wages long vaccinated disagree call naive fool believing right thinking dont think mother deserves money work shes done past 2 years? research. Lots things discuss here.

Most relevant, Wal-Mart would rural census bureaus MSA definitions. I'm sure using there, that's best guess.

Next, there's lot rural population areas like places like Branson, CO. takes lot 50 people towns equal one Trinidad, CO. (Which place describing, similar enough.)

And let's also act like Wal-Mart describing even emptier ""outskirts"" one.

Lastly, really know city lived like. Suffice say Atlanta Chicago. lived said city. 30 minutes suburbs plenty rural many places. story man, firm believer god.

One day began rain heavily. kept raining big flood came.
The man climbed roof house, knew would ok. God would protect him.

It kept raining water reached waist. boat came guy boat said: “Hey, jump in. take us”.
“No thanks”, said man. “I’m firm believer God. rescue me”. sent boat away.

It kept raining water reached neck. Another boat came guy boat said: “You look like could need help. Jump take us”.
“No”, said man. “I’m firm believer God. rescue me. Don’t worry me”. boat sailed away.

It still rained water reached mouth. helicopter came guy helicopter threw rope said: “Hi friend. Climb up. rescue you”.
“No”, said man. “I’m firm believer God. rescue me. know will”. helicopter flew away.

It kept raining, finally man drowned.

When man died, went heaven. entering Heaven, interview God.
After giving polite greeting sitting down, man asked: “Where you. waited waited. sure would rescue me, firm believer life, done good others. needed you?”
God scratched confused looking face answered: “I don’t get either. sent two boats helicopter”. Yeah, many different variations parable. quoting one *The West Wing*. true. first batch Pfizer shipped used up. Moderna came much later. got Moderna January front line. ""Everyone wants go meet God, race!""  plenty people love. every expert indicated virus stay rest lives. vaccinated, going issue. kids vaccinated, reason restriction remain.   health worker value gut feeling scientific evidence, deserve lose job, even vaccinated. business treating patients district, quarantine unvaccinated. course, kids choice matter, eagerly look forward able vaccinated us able leave state again.  metro NYC, large corporate firms seeing 90% vaccination rates. 

At worst, could 10% voluntary attrition. Let get infected cured bodies gave stronger immune system. Vaccinate everyone else pregnant vulnerable weakened immune systems. wish every single person gets covid bad way talks talks LOT! 

&amp;#x200B;

I live Rural America, 1 every 4 Americans vaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

When people know get covid, keep secret want look stupid admit wrong, think insanely dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone needs talking make reality hit anti-vaxers square face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tons people know think know anyone gotten covid, sending death threats local hospitals staff speak reality covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

and yes, wondering, hate many downvotes? Sometimes understand ppl here: even mind-boggling many nurses defiantly wrong, rejoice people fired. failure ppl involved: authoritarian methods used, livelihoods lost. exact symptoms two years Covid.  Sleep apnoea give exact set neurological symptoms.

It’s worrying, covid give symptoms nasty feels like mild dementia Epley maneuver BPPV, basically crystals get dislodged middle ear float around shouldn’t. that’s cause vertigo it’s great treatment. knows dude vertigo. vestibular evaluation trained PT. It’s fairly easy diagnose it’s middle ear related. Lol think you’re cross examined me. Yeah. That’s works. We’re citizens native country. run get downvoted like was

I wrong, 10% kids die Covid  Wow small world! Seriously though thank work get public. I'll tell I'm USAF veteran served OIF/OEF hearing responses ICU staff brought back lot memories people I've worked involved intense firefights deployed. hit hard share lot similarities. story even helps couple people change mind get vaccinated worth it. I’ve discovered decade symptoms skip it, vertigo episodes consistently, even vertigo isn’t bad day. However, mine bad almost disabled. spent 6 months flat back trying puke dizziness. this: religious exemptions *anything* good. There's reason respect particular belief simply imaginary friend told obey.  Crazy beliefs less crazy cult believes things you. girlfriend nurse.

Not getting vax get suspended become liability workplace. 

Your job care people can’t even take smallest fucking step help stop spread covid. Get fucked. valid points. High schools also tend larger number students. 

They still wear masks indoors Actually, since things look moment, okay anymore. country can't go back regular lives low minority want get vaccine. happening everywhere else, thiny portions people one reasons virus staying, so, I, personally, want go back things before, I'm ok anymore people getting stupid vaccine. What's incorrect? life you? know people around behave? also true, nothing indicate case here. There’s need go commenter “you known better” type comments it’s perfectly likely didn’t option begin with. live Idaho. I’m petrified right loved ones injury medical issue quality care toilet anti vaxx nut jobs clogging hospital systems.

Scott Gottlieb one best voices pandemic. required vaccinated entry rather within 1 year apply change status. According link, seems state department working international partners get ways vaccinate It’s weird religion always valid excuse now. Stupid stupid does. go get vaccinated, allow return work?

Give three months suspension, they're vaccinated back work that, made permenant. large portion population strong sterilizing immunity right holiday season bad idea.

Thats completely different thing.

Is really necessary keep reminding people healthcare workers went past 18 months? Apparently dont see would deserve it.

Were living rock past two years? Look like happened UK starting happen dramtic decreases delta variant anywhere see numbers overburdened hospitals, etc.? 

How many hospitals room, many excess deaths due overburdened healthcare, many patients getting care otherwise would, etc. France done far better job US, live, infections exactly January. 

Regardless, vaccinate find new line work. students also age socialize unsupervised (presumably without masks etc) outside school, work high risk jobs (fast food, etc), generally poor decision making skills relative amount autonomy compared younger kids. 

From high school, appears cases come outside school, it’s spreading class. (As see cars pulling five teens inside, sipping Starbucks). It’ll spread friend groups, classrooms (generally speaking obviously) serious agenda right scientific community align stop anyone boosting rest world catches up. perfect world literally every unused shot ends arm person developing world, see real argument.

The scientific community donate booster shots countries then. taxes pay, want boosters available loved ones. way much COVID around complacent. even bothering trying warn people? 

If dumb enough PAY veterinary grade medication instead FREE vaccine....

Honestly fucking people. made joke earlier drinking sea water cure, beat punch mouth washing iodine? Ffs  gonna act like people trust Israeli data vaccine efficacy delta?? Trust science tho!!! California QR code save phone option see uf state 
I'm thrilled I, luck draw, received Moderna vaccine, people miss big picture here--that three vaccines performing incredibly well. already told first two steps. 2 parts ignored 2nd part. sounds right given much resistance people vaccinated yet. Even that's true getting closer closer month unvaccinated dying people getting jab.

I checked 210 million (64%) least one shot. feeling number going shoot vaccine mandate deadlines closing vaccine approval 12 coming soon. Roughly 17% population 12. We’ve patronizing local restaurants require vaxx proof. Win/win. Come that's true.

You replied comment wanted show people smart were.

The ironic thing accomplished opposite wanted. absolutely obvious everyone vaccinated people spread covid (to MUCH lesser degree)

No one needed vast wealth non related knowledge.  must either fool think bonuses better way risk losing job simply naive.

No matter throw faces still people refuse vaccine religion, politics propaganda. refuse bitter end f**ck commitement Covid waves. limited group deserve incentive vaccination got right away?

The bonuses paycheck one fighting Covid since begining like doctor nurses like mother got vaccine soon possible worked ass since Day 1 pandemic.

P.s yes Italy country healthcare workers got small bonus paycheck (of course forever course no-vax refuse still get vaccine also lose paycheck soon enough). vaccine literally free.

Ivermectin costs people money doesn’t effect Covid. WaY TyRaNNy OpprEsSiOn.

You aren’t discriminated against. You’re victim misinformation. result, perpetuating pandemic. am. mean listen, means hear. difference. large scale cold chain infastructure needed sustain large scale vaccination campaign using Pfizer many countries? based get bonus driving drunk, ?

Because getting vaccine lowest bar clear. simply doesn’t deserve it. I’m situation. RA got booster 3 weeks ago. getting tested see produced antibodies. really hope I’m really frustrated angry anti-vaxxors forcing continue hermit like existence. take prednisone treatment RA also guts immune system, especially high doses, basically anything 20 mgs day. No. can't won't. lipread I'm ""compromising"" sacrificing comfort.

This real world. Aren’t deaf? Incorrect. moved US tested TB syphilis asked MMR record. Since MMR vaccination done school record doctor gave another shot. told unusual, mandatory vaccination nothing new, gave zero fucks rolled sleeve. 

I've also produce Yellow fever records various vaccination enter Tanzania. people obsessed vaccines.  Meanwhile people flying Egypt 20 hour flights go CVS US vaccines widely available country. stupid fucking nation idiots  Saw r/atheism rhetorical question. know cant.

The rate new infections France 16% peak last year steadily decreasing time now. despite increase testing.

Why lie like that? I'd rather talk someone remove mask lipread. answer notes, I'm interested say obviously worth listening to. FDA CDC would let us get initial vaccinations provide ""adequate"" protection severe disease apparently global policy domain. Illinois 4.4% positivity rate think high transmission category beyond fucking stupid. states like California, Illinois, others lumped exact category Texas Florida? Wow. crazy. looking summary paragraphs whole article good. get big side effects vaccine, mean corona wouldve hit harder well? correlation Color photocopy front/back laminate photocopy. Keep hardcopy home photos front/back hardcopy.

Edit: booster info still go hardcopy create new laminate copy after. they'll get sued people become ill.  live then? Behavioral factors would likely shared days group 4-6 days post booster group, since cohort people. strongly suggests factor 5x improvement time frame due booster, systemic differences booster/ booster groups. annual flu shot American thing? Denmark it’s usually offered old frail. places big they’re game town.

Unless hard data, I'm going accept rural Wal-Mart restaurant seeing higher volume higher volume/ft^2 everything I've experienced counter that.

Back high school, wanted get new game release black Friday deals, drive 30 minutes rural Wal-Mart.

That place always ghost town comparison Walmart city. point boosters would mean staying 60% chance contracting Covid given unpredictable course take anyone catches especially older people. Unironically kind based  anthropomorphize it, virus, deadly consequences.

I keep trying tell people deadly HIV/AIDS. catch another person removing clothing, take much faster AIDS. too. Refusal care, yes. Refusal admittance, yes. Bring vaccine passports triage tent hospitals unvaccinated. want government forcing medical care mentally-fit body. Educate, segregate impact rest us.

Passports, people think nothing walking fast auto gate, vs seeing someone (if that's even option anymore), know we're country offer these. Many do. agree, think they’re use “sCiEnCe” bad faith way. final decision policy/moral/philosophical/logistical question, core questions science charged answering come back “boosters work, boosters safe, boosters useful” far tell. Yep. America plague state point. 


There sizable percentage population absolutely refuse get vaccinated -- father one them. 


Biden mandated companies either require vaccination require weekly covid tests (businesses 100 employees) -- hopefully impact shit's bad here. gonna get worse winter approaching. ""You always trust Americans right thing they've exhausted every option"" Churchill think. 


Currently half population still trying every option thing. insinuating rather people unnecessarily die single ""draconian"" law? people got first shot on-site could attend NFL game.

Like, day? know work way orrr Foolish moderna made shot good. Pfizer around block times knew build planned obsolescence.

/s…sort Swede here. Yes restrictions lifted end month. stuff like max number people public events, longer advice work home, restrictions restaurants etc.

 though really going noticeable think many people. jobs Corona changed go things overall pretty much normal living. 

 example live hardly see anyone using mask visiting big supermarket. Might like couple people 100+.

 Also people pretty keeping distance stuff like store. get none?  Hey focus comments instead important part article. virus devil  buh-bye vaccine work people. will, relies person getting healthy immune system. So, really, ""her immune system work"". This, unfortunately, also meant vulnerable covid.

This heard phrase ""herd immunity"". rely getting vaccine protect unlucky ones. we've eliminated smallpox, well polio US. Even breakthroughs, still less likely catch covid vaccinated, slowing spread, providing protection vulnerable may protected.

This people angry refuse vaccinated. shortsighted see, simply care, decisions putting people higher risk. case infectious disease, health public, individual's actions harm others. also putting strain US health services, causing need areas keep restrictions around try manage surge. Antivaxxers actually prolonging pandemic US unnecessarily. We'd whole ""normalcy"" higher vaccine uptake hospitals strained. kids eligible, could even potentially gone back normal higher vaccine uptake. Instead, we're long trailing end we've reached point noncovid patients issues getting critical healthcare. color coded map slightly different thresholds cases well. shows NE well. believe coffee bleach enemas actual cure real doctors like chiropractors prescribing...(/s case). database since it’s vaccines done New York. apps administered elsewhere effectively honor system. understanding vaccines ingredient stimulates body's reaction Mrna, Mo Pz use different ingredient function. Pz's ingredient allows get similar immune response using less Mrna. 

'More Mrna better' seems jump conclusions. Yes, WA we've used border crossings states covid (eg lockdown), we've made secret it.

We've deaths due covid year, despite Fed's failed embarrassing vaccine rollout. We've like 6 cases community since May 2020, fully open economy, masks, restrictions nightclubs/few restrictions even festivals, basically deaths illness due disease.

We've even able return people states, know 2 people currently waiting quarantine/recently returned Melbourne Sydney - cost it. come free, means entering state place covid requires mingling community cleared 3 tests, etc. meant telling police quarantining, showing are.

Small price pay, imo, able spend last year clubbing *and* seeing grandparents, fully vaccinated. Well, one getting second shot Monday. me, living covid past year, especially vaccines, seems far dystopian option. Especially anxiety, comes seeing family. Stay away now. We’re… struggling bit. problem anti-vaxers questionable health choices make (made) themselves. outspoken nature need rationalize choices propagating false information parroted garbage sources. deathbed video usually first video, last string TikTok Facebook digital vomit, pushing health experts somehow stumbled onto truth, truth conveniently dovetails narratives already created themselves.

I celebrate deaths. want die. want anyone die. harm they've done continue society last decades. deathbed videos help reverse damage small way. High income folks getting stimulus begin with. want see mixed dosing I'm following science. better advice US currently getting out. Israel seems better handle things. Made chuckle Explain stop using ""it disproportionately affects black people thus racist here""? Oh believe personal choices suddenly exist? Interesting...I think many areas life personal choice exists... It’s first I’ve heard it. live NYC. 

It’s first I’ve known governments force people send surveillance reports home.

Well, outside China fair. Oh, hush. Let people take heart good news. 

If going insist miserable things absolutely perfect, could least courtesy quietly.  I'm confused Excelsior Pass....if database, know actually vaccinated set up?

Seriously though good partner return workplace immune system still minor mystery. know coworkers iffy practices there's contingent people building high variance risk factor; but, think minimize that. Helps we're actually fairly low transmission area ourselves, even California.

Best luck states, especially NY.   Yep! That's me, thanks😁

Tight media controls/censorship means there's lot anti-vax pressure, honestly little pro-vax pressure also, us did, real incentives common sense. mandates, pretty much come go wherever unvaxxed (although show QR code contact tracing). relative stuck...yeah much pushing get unstuck. genuinely hope he's ready willing become test case DeSantis's idiotic law. ARGGGGGG! Thanks heard doctor yesterday. hope works. 

Still though, I'm certain vaccine prevented far worse symptoms. boss (who I'm 99% certain gave refused vaxxed cavalier masking) hospital 3 weeks lost 60% lung capacity.  guess bit cynical, one fears university use covid excuse justify cancelling events cost university money. spring, cancelled commencement due “not wanting create superspreader event” holding 5000 person football game. made increasingly cynical, I’m suspecting university take advantage covid justify cancellations, it’s save expenses thus generate profit. ER (not Covid related) waiting 5 hours surrounded symptomatic Covid patients

There's lot evidence viral shedding spread happens early course COVID infection, mostly patient needs hospital care. much concern asymptomatic presymptomatic spread community. Unless studied efficacy boosters (you haven't) really position say whether dosage difference significant not. course statistically significant, seem completely ignore countries discussing Sweden, makes absolutely sense. Last time checked, Estonia actually significantly higher excess mortality Problem people hands beds cleaning staff doctors. people low educated. strong culture long affects fellow citizens - it’s fine. problem.

The states haven’t lockdowns seem gloat longest lockdowns world. lockdowns get dropped “I get see grandmother go clubbing” rhetoric. I'm sorry, world still pretending virus hurt children. try using logic here. love it.

When scientists estimate cost (less $1 per strip!), generally neglect costs getting regulatory hurdles paying people company capable mass-producing necessary jobs packaging design accounting etc. Germany that's already case.

Also keep mind chest pain extremely common symptom anxiety. wait, long wait times can’t happen us. aren’t socialized country!! /s  We’ve almost got licked, boys! may case explain number cases UK? worst Europe number cases last 2 months even highest vaccination rate population among big country like Italy, Spain, France Germany despite religious like bible belt USA Spain Europe.

I would expect something like say heavy catholich country like Italy Spain sharp decrease cases stabilization number deaths.

If ask USA UK rise cases mortality despite high vaccination rate may people (not everybody good chunck) governament (for USA mean Republicans states governor) give fuck general refuse speed vaccination campaign. quite silly. We've vaccinated 41% teenagers aged 12 18 Netherlands. one died side effects.

Aside vaccinated, whould yall speculate actively sick virus could protective viruses immune system specific that? imagine symptoms, immune system fired able find new intruders faster set up. lot people mistrust governments ones rabidly vote people screw exactly promised do.

Then (typically minorities) legitimately genuinely get screwed government. distrust absolutely understandable.

Smoking (and another medical procedure won’t mention name) also take away 600,000 every year. bad. 

Hope wa Oh get high horse, everybody USA refusing vaccinations blame poor people chance, country, reality. don’t want pass Covid children, friends, parents, people life. might fine, can’t guarantee be. CDC vs FDA! Round one! FIGHT!   bet DeCuntass loves this. 🤣🔥 Ferrer said county health officials also strongly recommending, though requiring, vaccine verification indoor portions restaurants.

Restaurants must something special slow spread industries aren’t privy to.

That makes lot sense, lot nonsense.  think patronising arrogant ignorant. really doubt teacher least grasp language logic. exactly evangelists even want happen cell lines? Nicki Minaj claim Covid vaccine cause impotence dismissed ~~Trinidad Tobago~~ anyone functioning brain. LMAO, way homeopathic territory now. already got third shot month ago approval, 5 6 month threshold. saw initial data Israel live high risk, low vaccine area. FDA slides, N 300, expect see rare events. Let person want. What’s you?

Looks like lot nasal sprays throat rinses showing promise COVID I'm hoping apply diseases. Couple new mRNA vaccines might honestly better place disease-wise post-COVID era.  buy it. Seems like anytime someone ass, people try turn ""they're distracting us something else"" I’m pretty sure expert balls department sure medical background though. think commodity means include housing?

The government could seize housing make available people, need pay rent. government could build new housing conditions. Landlords exclusively extractive, add nothing economy society. 

Students right housing everyone else. countries students actually paid stipend going school covers housing food, already. also think universities charge students anything. 

Ultimately even think currency anymore there's lot needs happen happens. Hopefully approve younger kids soon. Last heard early next year. Most, yes. Make count. Yeah, presented possible way resolve conflict since two parties would able least interact one another. could well methods. state. 

Sydney, Canberra Melbourne locked down. Pretty much everywhere else country living normally zero low community cases  Contact local news outlet, PBS/NPR, TV station get story there. I've seeing stories, interest. also reported safety concerns clinical trials booster shots, followed around 320 participants three months.

320 participants?

I’m vaccines doesn’t seem like nearly enough people. myocarditis risk young people like 1 50,000 2nd shot. could 10x even 100x 3rd shot likely wouldn’t detect 320 participants. 

Hopefully see numbers Israel soon would much larger sample. really feel bad Dr Dobbs. appears sensible guy continually surprised rising tide hogwash swamping everything tries do. Gotcha. Appreciate info. stand wait little longer, personal risk low since work remotely. plans starting early October, I’m hoping definitive guidance place then. I’d prefer make false claim immunocompromised avoid it, watching calendar. I’ll admit I’m bit “Goody Two-Shoes” things… Hope comments made feel like good person👍🏻 believe Covid aren’t conspiracy theorist thanks assuming that. Maybe take step back ask you’re afraid shadow. went hospital Australia last week sitting triage. woman came Covid symptoms, gone 2 minutes, never seen again. sure does. agree. Thank kind words. COULD allocate certain amount resources it, cap set capacity, allowing procedures proceed.

I know they'd legally able without jeopardizing Medicare payments.

If someone experiencing emergency medical condition needs emergency treatment, hospitals legally can't send home. They're required EMTALA try stabilize patient (regardless ability pay provide proof insurance) can't discharge transfer patient unless patient gives informed consent, stabilized they're transferring hospital better equipped provide treatment (as case - kid burst appendix transferred another hospital better equipped handle pediatric emergency surgery). 

I'm skeptical simply designating certain resources ""not COVID patients"" would allow hospitals discharge COVID patients experiencing emergency. assume agree gold commodity.

I also assume agree amount gold cost different amount based buy it, whom, shape in, features come it.

Just like piece paper says much gold someone else's warehouse cost amount gold made shape wedding ring housing KS housing NY cost same.

Also, commodity mean financial trading sense term. Anything assigned value also used considered commodity. Time considered commodity like gold time worth everyone every situation. 

Housing treated right everyone entitled access Sounds reasonable would juicy carrot still holding getting vaccinated believe also see class action suits related fundraising. likely get opportunity. Oddly enough, rest PA cases going up… one county going down/is stable, Philadelphia county. 

Our mayor actually brought back mask mandates Early August, every school city mandatory mask wearing. Cases going pretty fast August mandates appear slowed spread. rest world thinks 😂 Yeah, makes hard calculate true mortality rate is. Time create www.freedomamericaeaglescreech.com start fighting misinformation misinformation I'm someone married virologist actually read studies follow conspiracy theory nonsense YouTube actually listen experts. seem like someone went teaching fallback really know assign homework. actually valued education would probably encourage students listen experts feel bad education quality.

Edit: also clarify using called strawman argument. never said anything living fear rest lives I'm merely saying listen experts instead pretending know better. since seem know lot explain referred dunning-kruger effect less know something confident knowledge. Essentially ignorance bliss.  Proof vaccination first thing ask ER. vaccine, go home. big question long efficacy infection lasts third shot. know Galileo picked fight Church first. humiliated went public way.

You know evolution natural selection doesn’t stance whether God not. People downvoting cause you’re condescending douchebag. Hope helps!  Sure, worst case scenario body basically naive reinfection, right? actually worse never caught covid first place. thought still mount immune response though, even body takes towards end think get enough antibodies actually work you. hope never case friend. Thank support. Buddy, 5 today that's without FL TN. think take vaccination status account comes triage seems unlikely. go general rule saving care need benefit (I.e likely survive). Unfortunately lot time unvaccinated shitbird getting priority people heart attacks, strokes, cancer, etc. Sounds like good idea Hospitals turn away unvaccinated COVID. Full stop.

This kid innocent family probably F'ed financially bunch selfish idiots.

The unvaccinated made choice, go think die ditch. Thank wear one Covid? could die waiting, effectively solving problem... vaxxed need bed, toss dumpster. God cure seem like goal. Considering commenting post study saying social distance matter indoors seemed especially ignorant. Everyone get sick die one day, matter many illnesses eliminate. That’s cold hard truth life. seem like insufferable loser won’t continue convo. fun locking house rest life. We’ll living lives! anti vaxxers killing everyone pretending fault

Those god damned third worlders! 

Fun fact: Delta variant infects vaccinated people! 

I know told Covid going disappear, **the entire third world** vaccinated, variants Covid-19 coming **for years.**


Please stop weaponizing global pandemic shit people. nobody's fault Covid-19 thing.  may asymptomatic unknown complications could present years now. 

I stand early pandemic statement things like “COVID-Lung” thing coming years. early organ failure/complications due untreated unvaccinated infection. looked current production output levels. Pfizer+Moderna putting 300 million doses per month right now. US skipped boosters, *if* supply limiting issue, things sped 2-3 weeks; less they're offered elderly/high risk/healthcare workers.

That's extreme view is... we're talking saving millions people delaying rollout months. pure principle people... care small benefit is, care much effectiveness severe disease drops, care long actually takes roll world... *had ours* (nevermind we're paying others), must go back line. Name vaccine endorsed vast majority medical professionals. Shocked pikachu face laws made idiots idiots use defense. Look Texas Iowa example. idiot Governors getting pissing match federal government causing people die. Listen CDC they're people actually studied stuff. Fuck county 65 yrs old 49% vaccinated. don’t go anywhere Delta rampant.  It’S fLu Hahaha yeah, really brings stark contrast crap really barely-disguised violent misogyny. think Jesus immune system save them. Epidemiologically, first cases covid US mostly found West Coast. 

But New York ended gateway cases. New York denser, mass transit dependent, international visitors, immigrants. epidemic seeded New York anyone knew problem.

At study NYU variables—the total population MSA [Metropolitan Statistical Area], number international passengers per capita arriving departing MSA April-June 2019, share commuters MSA using public transit (a proxy high density)—explains 48 percent variation date onset Coronavirus infection, measured number days since 29 February 2020 MSA reported least ten cases Coronavirus infections 27 March 2020. 

Washington first bat lockdown. small scale lockdowns, first large scale ones Puerto Rico (March 15), California (March 19), New York (March 20), New Jersey (March 21) Ohio (March 22). Washington one eight states announced lockdowns March 23. say take someone else needs it. Refusing vaccinate means refuse contribute wellness society. benefit societal benefits (aka hospital resources) act like don’t want part society? vaccine cards passports never use them? Majority ppl smart phones scan needed? Whenever kids/ adults get vaccinated doctors office don’t leave vaccine card -they put medical chart etc. 
why get cards? I’m sure areas asking card majority places? Don’t already protocol based refusing vaccines? happens refuse flu shot? never happen? Asthma public health team confident efficacy vaccines looks likely they'll recommend getting rid even testing self-isolating. continuously cautious advisers Europe, even thinking that, think shows sufficient level immunity across population, restrictions dropped. self respecting doctor would work there. really unfortunate Drew Weissman's wife went crazy started spamming NYT articles comments saying husband, Karikó, solely credit pioneer work mRNA. feel bad him, obviously understand scientific work.   College student here. boat. Classes suck right now. golden rings made thing?

""Things made commodities also commodoties."" total nonsense.

Tell what, give definition commodity like use found reasonably acceptable source. america, wont name drop place, gf extremely emberassed country past two years...   social end pandemic nearing, dude. Covid endemic, people aren’t going put life hold much longer. 

I’ve already lost half college experience this. I’ll never get back. Yeah here. put mask rarely feels like minor inconvenience me, wearing one 8+ hours every day I'd probably feel different it. lockdowns meant prevent.  5 km rule maybe, know anyone stayed within household height first third lockdown?  Staffed who? US least regular hospitals already understaffed losing staff selfish assholes society causing undue stress entire system, prior Covid already brink collapse anyway.  Plus, they’re different bioterrorists point. bet many supported Jan 6 insurrection even participated. high uptake can't put that. functional society high level trust state science. Honestly, doctors paying attention unvaccinated adults anymore? made choice. spend last dollar legally pursuing Ron DeSantis homicidal policies directly caused death.

Someone needs to. that's kind manslaughter think exists.  stopped talking looneytoon sister law last weekend! It’s excellent!  us aren’t willing pay price. lot us, little things make life worth living.  likely Russian gang. system entire public health service shut rebooted scratch, extremely hectic couple weeks since hospitals everything paper. also really annoying getting daily updates vaccine uptake.

Deaths still reported beforehand, that's bit different way they're counted general convoluted process.  happens “me first” mentality combined childish mentality cooperating authority. feel bad people suffer idiotic antivaxxers. could queue made non vaccinated people presenting Covid infections, put people back line behind everyone else. made decisions irresponsible, get endanger people’s lives well.    employees dodged infection wearing ""masks"" people think though, wearing N95 respirators. There's never serious doubt N95s extremely effective. could set number beds times anyone unvaccinated   They’re saying going lie, don’t fake identity, lie say immunocompromised. record 3 shots it. Nobody care. That’s 100% okay prerogative. us mask much longer, especially kids vaccinated, don’t surprised many people board you. Faces important communication conversation. Hopefully get replaced individuals don’t push back hard things like “science,” “data,” not.

Fixed ya.   roll out! Like scene Airplane! passengers line shake/slap/clobber someone vaguely hysterical. Except case, behind long line Covid symptoms/problems, there's tank somehow fit aisle aircraft ready making sounds using guy's bones. Oh, agree everyone needs vaccinated. question &amp; let’s hope mandates help.

If places ship COULD go aren’t actively trying reduce spread following CDC guidelines &amp; adhering vaccination/mask mandates, fuck 'em. Put ships places local population trying part solution &amp; creating problems.

Republicans &amp; conservatives talk big game personal responsibility. Yet, people vast (VAST!) majority people acting irresponsibly.

Children significant risk Covid. benchmark always level hospitalisations unvaccinated adults causing problem, highly vaccinated area okay. context, Ireland considering dropping testing 12s also never wear masks school anywhere else. Although think masking makes sense rest 2021 try ease winter wave much possible. Everyone tragedy half country wont recognize… Many Portugal received J&amp;J 1 dose regime.

But need booster soon. True. could rounding up.

Making claims worrying disease something incredibly common huge part human interaction point anymore worrying. Yes sure don’t time being. like perilous times. pass.

Typically theyd couple cases per surgeon per day. ICU bed available cardiac surgery. currently number one surgeon, entire department. 20% surgeries doing.

Its sick patients pay emergency treatment delayed. cant stand unvaxxed demanding sick people provide welfare them. wish hospitals could/would turn unvaxxed away. Let choices, dont waste resources validating choice protecting consequences.

I specified cardiac work heart vascular research. I'm sure departments similar problems. Vaccines effective immunity infection, protection lasts longer. infected get vaccinated  He's got Street Cred. Good career 🙄 People forgoing vaccine really voluntarily forgo hospital care. It’s fair they’re choosing clog precious medical resources something easily preventable. else temporary disaster tents set care unvaccinated patients, run volunteers, could redirected facilities instead. False equivalency. 

Would hire 7 day Adventist pave driveway? Like, cares?

This cancellation tour - sick desire destroy livelihood people don’t agree you. 

Guess what? people wear masks don’t vaccinate don’t care got vaxxed. They’re calling office trying get fired Yeah perverse kind mentality current system creates. reasonable person, living somewhere makes place home Lol. Damn decimals. Totally prefer exponents. think it’s around 6M globally tho. Yes literally resources handle preventable healthcare problems.

My wife lost friend blood clot hospitals area anything laid hallway died.  country reached 82% population (including can't vaccinated like children) fully vaccinated 87% first dose. next week we'll 85+ % fully vaccinated. Last couple weeks we're vaccinating mainly 12-17yo 18-24yo. 25y- 49y age group 89% fully vaccinated age groups 50yo 97% fully vaccinated. New COVID-19 infections declining every week, despite since mid August 100% new cases dangerous Delta variant (we one first EU countries hit Delta variant).

 Despite mask mandate streets/outside week. Sports events cultural events still attendance limitations, restaurants business still capacity limitation, government considering removing mask mandate closed spaces like businesses next week hit 85% population fully vaccinated, right still mask mandate closed spaces. Despite hitting 85% population vaccinated, kindergarten/preschool keep limitations covid measures (I'm parent young child, read that), parents can't enter building every worker still use mask, sure schools, right there's mandate everyone - teachers kids (above 10 yo ) use mask, know keeps next week, think government keep mask mandate schools too.

Vaccination stop spread COVID-19, high vaccination rates works well less infections, great reducing people ICU covid. Florida, Texas republican States criminal policies opening everything dropping mask mandates low vaccination rates. really sad see politics mixed vaccines mask use. USA could hundreds thousands less deads COVID-19 that... former USA president turned COVID-19 pandemic political battleground. Sue a**es everything got, please. Yeah, Oregon spared first wave due extreme lockdown well. We’ve got mask mandate now, though. unvaccinated haven’t lucky Delta wave here. Holy shit I've never read story cheer landlord times, etc.

I'd sign lease heartbeat  Thank !! I’m tired damn people don’t want get vaccinated. go film stores trying infect people . 

They don’t deserve care definitely don’t deserve priority patients . actually sick need resources limited medical resources, allocated maximize number survivors.

unvaccinated covid patients low survival rate large resource demand. don’t know times it’s happened, there’s 2 roads.

From [CDC far show vaccinated people 8 10 times less likely infected 25 times less likely experience hospitalization death. 

From study found Three times many unvaccinated people tested positive Covid-19 fully vaccinated.

From [Fox D.C. Virginia, breakthrough infections comprise 0.26% 0.03% cases, adding ""the bottom line is, [breakthrough infections] rare rarely result -- rarely -- unusually, result hospitalization death."" type people celebrated, guys bounce balls down. Yeah fucking blows lie. Wow Spain basically crushed Delta  You’d surprised. child’s school multiple children sicknesses claim flu cold, magically COVID cases. Good testing harder get now, at-home testing isn’t accurate. It’s likely amount Covid cases high schools, even claiming little cases. It’s struggle quit every single shift. hemorrhaging staff, peoples mental health can’t handle anymore. got 2nd shot Moderna last Friday. never looked were, different addresses 2nd shot, wrong last name wife.

I care, right. getting numbers from?  Church brings people together every week country. church, sports. freely available vaccine would dramatically reduce hospitalizations deaths heart attacks? Yes. 

There reason get vaccinated, unless one people medically unable. can't bothered get simple injection protect others, get pretend selfish. get compare someone heart attack. go get it. Nobody gonna check w/ doc validate immunocompromised status Yes happening.

I'm told rights mean shit US military cutting check ""Basic accommodations"" include things kill people. basically saying immunocompromised people work customer service job people like you. discrimination keeping people safe. mindset literally kill people mine inconvenience deaf people. Deaf people exist expect accommodations kill people unless willing accept murder charge. wondering this, often see comments people immunocompromised able vaccinated, thought known thing. ""I'm fully vaxxed, brother can't, he's immunocompromised, know...""

But everything I've read says extremely small number rare circumstances CDC recommends vaccination. even important immunocompromised vaccinated. thought missing something. Seems like lot misinformed ""common knowledge"" there. “Oh there's it, makes important?”

Yes, that’s immunology works. Less deaths good thing. benefits getting vaccinated far outweigh risks. Far, far people die covid-19 complications even adverse shot reactions, take weird, unrelated Afghanistan argument shove shoved double standards. 

“It's anecdotal”

No, it’s not. keep using word. don’t think means think means. facts science easily find CDC local health department websites directly refute much BS you’ve spewed…

“nobody knows endgame constantly changing narrative evolving situation.”

For once, yes, that’s accurate. whole “we demand solution” isn’t medicine science work; you’re setting disappointment anger don’t that. shit isn’t dealing absolutes gotta stop expecting it. hope silver bullet found take care vaccinations take care others wearing masks social distancing. mad isn’t clear end game reason spread misinformation deny science reality.

“Why treatment pushed?”

It isn’t pushed isn’t answer yet. Demanding answers doesn’t make come thin air. literally hundreds studies trying find treatment like would common cold… aren’t seeing news shit difficult nothing silver bullet yet.

“Everyone's solution get vaccine even fucking solution.”

If reduces risk hospitalization death 10x, yes, ir totally solution.

“No talk eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise. Fattest fucking country world everybody wants magic pill jab solve problems.”

Eating veggies won’t help us get healthy enough beat covid. need something lessen load hospitals healthcare system.

“The news mocks Ivermectin, even know truth history behind yet talk horse paste. Why?”

I trust fact reputable studies found link ivermectin solving covid-19 problem. ask yourself: talking ivermectin, drug whose ingredients don’t know whose label clearly says “dewormer” talking taking drug doctors scientists telling take? favor vaccine, literally in, out, take couple sick days, far less worried dying?

“Just check downvotes :)”

People sort gone astray notion “follow science”. work scientists informs us possible paths take consequences, good bad, path entails. policy makers people decide information. Science inherent morality suggested path. Science tells us continued emission greenhouse gasses lead significant changes global climate. impacts include increased severity frequency wild fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, unstable polar vortexes, along severe weather events. Additionally see sea level rise, ocean acidification, mass extinction, changes ocean currents, among significant impacts. combined consequence humanity destabilization food supply, mass human displacement, economic instability potential contraction, decreased quality life, death. choose info. becomes moral decision outside science whether stop emitting.

What happened, especially recently, science given us forecasts consequences obviously terrible, one reason another groups people want ignore forecasts agenda. this, people ascribed moral imperative science tells us marching obvious doom. science isn’t making moral decision telling anything, based science says. COVID, science tells us COVID kills hurts people masks vaccines make kill/hurt way less people. Obviously people dying bad try avoid outcome people agenda violated actions needed avoid outcome, try ignore science says refute people dying mass obviously bad. It’s easier attack ignore science fight moral battle obviously lose. Could imagine COVID denying politicians saying “We know people die COVID clog emergency rooms, don’t care”. know sucks say, either deny, ignore, fight science pick different battle like one based personal freedom. People refute “follow science” respect prevention measures like masks vaccines science told people dying bad, didn’t. moral judgement science didn’t make, albeit obvious one. made obvious pretty straight forward moral judgement pertaining outcome clear cut science.

Here boosters, science tells us boosters increase protection infection serious disease non-trivial amount. That’s science says. make moral decision whether increased protection worth using vaccine way logistical struggles distributing doses domestically. people saying “the science says don’t need another dose” really mean “I believe extra immunity conferred worth cost risk giving people another dose”. That’s moral judgement science make. person values, beliefs, background, agenda did. moral judgement decide path respect boosters preferable. Science doesn’t say anything shouldn’t good bad. People making moral judgements do. Science tells us happen pour boiling water myself. choose ascribed negative value outcome science suggests happen. need disentangle science says moral judgements. helps keep science dispassionate, protects scientists political influence, makes decision makers accountable moral decisions based scientific information. Like housing co-op, residents building co-owners got J&amp;J too. Already Covid once, vaccine available, despite careful masking. Ended long covid. Super scared get again. Wish could go get Moderna! horrifying. Thousands upon thousands ppl go random occurrences day end hospital, undeservingly cannot treated. We're putting even lives jeopardy keeping rooms filled covid patients...Insane

We seriously need start denying treatment beyond EMTALA requirements (requires ""stabilization"" only, ""treatment"").  And, fat isn’t contagious. missus feeling playful. idea deaf people matter lives immunocompromised. think people die communicate. selfish piece shit worked store waltzed would refuse service I'm pulling mask reason. exceptions.

I've people try things similar always ends kicked cannot accommodate them.

The lives immunocompromised coworkers customers important comfort orders magnitude. I'm sorry think ability communicate important human life.   Infection control says we've got to. wear one work, outside it. staff remove mask talk me. Possibilities:

1. impotence NM saw caused COVID vaccine.

2. impotence NM saw caused NM's personality.

3. impotence NM saw caused something unrelated.

I'm pretty sure 1 least likely possibility far. think basic critical thinking skills would make huge difference. Right misinformation easy people tools disposal see it. believe education practice make people less vulnerable manipulated. everyone able understand use skills need, pretty much everyone going slip time time, can't believe make difference.   doc surrender Mario kart break someone take seriously? Oh one Americans. idea deaf culture class entails 8 semesters means nothing me. say fluent took classes thought easy.

You're vile, entitled arsehole. Yeah way since start. put hiatal hernias surgery year thanks first Covid19 strain. wanted kill constant LPR. 99.9% survival rate, amirite? Yeah, New Zealand might get control. think US. many politicians millions general public pro-virus.  give someone Covid maybe figure out. Maybe. Oh good point yeah that's big difference. think landlord couple dozen properties overall mostly townhouses. wait - said nobody wears masks besides paranoid types, yet staff wearing them? you’re gonna hyperbolic try put someone down, least think through. time (we know long take Covid, will, eventually) viruses lose potency lose ability mutate fewer hosts. Even today find traces 1918 flu pandemic flu strains circulate, dying 1918 rates, potency pandemic diluted. killed ones could. thing happening covid. virus searches prays weak, cannot find enough hosts loses power. Covid-19 could significantly reduced would world concerted effort vaccinate everyone. 
But:.
Greed vaccine stockpiling rich nations
Lack desire share intellectual property make vaccine available production companies thus facilitate faster distribution
Numerous blunders CDC weakened trust tackling pandemic
A huge number vaccine skeptics
A huge gap knowledge general population basic understanding biology (thevresult long broken education system)
The immense discrepancy wealth privilege led demise ones could stay home order food online work home
last, least, nature science (research), trial error always work progress, something vaccine deniers hard time grasping.
These things contributed Covid's future endemic behavior. treated thoughts prayers. Imagine working there. Let's hope Fauci slow-walk application, throws everything approve without compromising needed standards. 

Pfizer's filing application 5-11 year olds' jab shortly. Der Spiegel says kids might able get November. Pfizer file infant, toddler &amp; kindergarten kiddos, timeline extends Jan. flu  truly entire community! enrages think children getting sick, also families anyone interact with, teachers, school faculty, everyone. waited 15 hours seen Er, it’s real bad here.  didnt forget. think staying home 2 weeks (despite actually staying home secretly partying spreading covid more) ""flattening curve"". went back life usual immediately accused CDC lying covid didnt go away 2 weeks. batshit. Pfizer wants booster money

Though Wow, thats gonna cost extra 'murica! solution simpler harsher. Implement real triage protocols. someone comes ER health emergency good probability good outcome, unplug patient poor outcome. Every hospital contingency plan already established case situation occurs. Implement them. covid patients poor chance making vent, would probably end affecting most. stricter quarantine regime kill disease would better option. Even Delta flare-up, US suffered 600k casualties government (both Democrats Republicans) lacked political balls right thing.

With hindsight, politician could ensured zero-covid environment state would hailed hero now. Meanwhile countries 80% vaccination rates able back normal. spain soon able drop measures. hope reach 90% year. one bothers wearing masks. paranoid types generally avoid

What disgusting, disappointing thing read victim day. Full fucking clearly hate deaf people

Yes, I’m sure hate inspired take 8 semesters ASL university many, many hours deaf culture classes. 

Because understand cultural differences us vile, entitled asshole global pandemic think I’ll graciously assign character defect and/or unhealed trauma.

Removing mask 2 minutes presents multiple infection opportunities people. care people dying deaf people understanding me. ableist advocating something literally kill immunocompromised people. think immunocompromised stay home go grocery store want able understand cashier without go extra steps. YOURE asshole.

You die use alternate communication methods. immunocompromised die people stop masking deaf people want lip read. think clear whose concerns important right aren’t considered proof? idea would Fuck selfish nonvaxers poor excuses human beings.

Yesterday, largest hospital entire state started rationing care.

We're still person getting chirpy emails school safest place could possibly be.   Fiancé got Covid month ago, pregnant second child (my first biological).

Early mom skeptical became afraid virus vaccine time.  biden, scientists general, I'm pretty much landlords concept though, would rather see housing right. time?  sure, argument here. need focus obesity clear COVID treat type emergency imo patient recently 40s, pre-existing conditions. couldn’t figure episodes passing randomly, would struggle keep oxygen saturation sometimes seemingly reason. thought cardiac-related. imaging lungs docs like holy shit, got pneumonia, lungs look horrible. none labs showed signs infection. Eventually traced back relatively mild COVID infection year ago left lungs scarred shit. would surprised becomes common complication  back then, families could 13 kids still manage support themselves. Catholic Church big supporter science. Catholics Big Bang Evolution true. So:

There promising studies lacks sample size follow ups.

WHO urges people follow public health agencies’ roll plans instead buying taking mixed vaccines own.

Canada India solve supply bottleneck problem.

What’s CDC’s stance subject? can’t seem find official approval mixing vaccines. anyone know? Regardless numbers, it’s epidemic need something, anything can't thank enough sharing here, people need see it, people need feel it! Seriously big props local news station, hospital this, need convince people get vaccinated. Unless children, breaks heart see obesity run generations probably read 35%+ OBESE. Americans around 70%+ overweight. fact, CDC estimates obesity 40%+ American adults.

Edit: go, found source:  Men B actually two shot series.

Also it’s recommended (and recently required state) teenagers get Men ACWY booster junior year. Unvaccinated COVID cases lowest priority behind literally everything else. Including broken bones sprained wrists. spit science beg save you? Hard pass. Friday night catfish buffets. It’s unclear it’s every 6 months 6 months initial vaccination. Hepatitis A/B vaccine schedule 3 doses 0, 1, 6 months. appendicitis last month. Went ER pain, idea had. diagnosed within 15min immediately sent operating table. spent next 3 days hospital post-op ward. whole ordeal costed €150.

Dear Americans, get fucking shit together. I'm sorry. wish best. stack high unfortunately. sick world. Literately figuratively.  individualistic least. Instead they're conforming doctrine Fox News pundits. Looks like masks gonna part attire moving forward eh? Guess upside pretend I'm Winter Soldier. 🤷🏻 impose everything else. Make life inconvenient unvaccinated end getting shots. Yikes far gone gg. think COVID settles bit, boomers start age, start selling houses.

That said, think it'll make solid dent, massive sell-off would crash prices. Boomers living longer.

I think market large cool 1) rates start going back up, 2) COVID dies down, 3) labor shortages force immigration policy change (be favorable low skilled labor), 4) housing starts (new constructions) really start gaining steam builders look make money take advantage things 5) new construction techniques disrupt market making cheaper (modular homes, robotic construction, etc).

That could take though, think special situation ways. like perfect storm. massive generation newly hungry houses build family in, interest rates make mortgages attractive (even costs buying), generation pandemic WFH movement forcing people bigger spaces, generation financial crisis completely annihilated housing sector (2008). bound happen, really. Builders overcorrected stopped building 08, labor became expensive restricted. pandemic perfect match light fire.


For I'm going keep browsing zillow daydream  similar, although much MUCH less severe experience. go ER needed clearance doctor return work. option go clinic get quick check-up. expecting waste anyone’s time, greeted 10 hour window would call hold place seen.

I opted appointment following morning instead still 4 hour ordeal. felt terrible basically wasting time amounted permission slip. information booster reducing transmission breakthrough cases? 

Although increasing efficacy back 95% must help can't spread virus get infected. Mississippi’s crude death rate (from article): **0.3%** idiots cause mandate.

It law medical professionals vaccinated fda approved vaccine period. I'm surprised not. medicaid Medicare would explain lot. I'd say instead cap non vaccinated covid cases based hospital capacity.

100 ER beds? Max non vaccinated covid cases 40. already 40 hospital wait go somewhere else. die room that's point everyone vaccinated.

Obviously would apply people legitimate medical reason can't get vaccinated. Lmao, cry harder fuck America? that’s including permanently disabled people COVID (e.g kidney failure). CDC guidelines say mask community experiencing high levels Covid-19 transmission.

If point communities transmission rate drops moderate safe enough unmask indoors vaccinated.

Israel data showing third booster increases efficacy mild-moderate infections pretty much back Delta. definitely look getting one available. confused manufacturers Betadine say ""not demonstrated effective treatment prevention COVID- 19 viruses"". 

As long keep mouth shut say *is* effective cannot get sued get make money. looks like positive effect anyhow. hospitalization drastically lower vaccinated. Deaths also drastically lower. sure, I've taken seriously since started seeing news tonight still made huge impact surely every catholic spiritually compelled get vaccinated? Papal infallibility apply agree him? Who’s gonna work there? Staff low non covid units is.  Nah retirement race vaccination status. I'm saying put people without vaccine camps absolutely racist way worded.  Non vaccinated covid patients capped. Maybe 33% capacity? 

If can't get vaccinated help you. help space. space go somewhere else wait. wish mandates, necessary thing.

I'm Santa Barbara county hope get similar mandates. However much hope we're idiots. Probably cuz hippopotamus oath first case backyard first known deaths, Dow Constantine working behind scenes large tech companies King County / greater Seattle area late February, weeks Inslee’s mandates came down. continued bussing work far north end eastside March 13th watched P&amp;R went zero parking 8am nearly empty 9am first 2 weeks March; MS, Amazon, Nintendo, Google, Expedia, ect went WFH beginning March, weeks mandates came set precedent entire area businesses continue follow, also jump started initial plateau.  think it’s like thundercloud

She’s scaring info online months, says she’s holding Novavax, still trials. need showing people 24/7! Show uncensored, show everything. People get hint see realities virus. get raw, get real. whatever reason, censor media showing bad covid is. Well say fuck that. People need introduced reality much harder ignore constantly smacking face.

Also know many people ever visited loved ones ICU tell this, pre covid already depressing heartwrenching enough there. can't even begin imagine. sucks need showing people much sucks. Holy fucking shit vaccinated people get covid people can’t bother wear masks get vaccinated statically people going show potential long term issues cause number would go time, however I’m sure number probably still way smaller unvaxxed . lowest seven-day case rate nation.

That's still something considering largest population We're literally pretending shit exist kills 2k/day. (and number likely significantly undercounted look excess deaths) 


I honestly thought last spike going worst -- we're still finding ways fuck over. financial advisor son two pensioners Michigan, fully support message without Covid. 

The things private public pensions done people criminal. I’m loop this. happened Hungary? Something dry pension? China locked down. lock downs locally outbreak. approved mRNA use fetal cell lines.

The JNJ used [retinal cell line fetal cell lines taken recent abortions, derived decades old fetal cells (more detail ). cells replicate decades laboratory settings, thousands times removed original fetus cells, becoming known fetal cell lines. California largest population lowest case-rate nation, contagious variant covid ravages country. 

That's pretty impressive. heard October? Im hopeful. cannot add something contract (such lease) already illegal. Landlords cannot change rent prices will.

Also, ""right"" something, need contract. thinking privilege. like denying unvaxxed access supermarket, rather nightclub. hope become widespread. Housing, like eating, basic human needs. Literally nobody denied them. Breakthrough infections super rare, dozens covid *right now* either hundreds exposed many vaccinated. Yeah, really used want visit, even fantasized living Australia. fuck noise, I’m trying go hyper-police state problem see line thinking, catch many minor viruses time. serves immune system boosters. I’m advocating walking around coughing people exposing viruses confers immunity. 

Never getting sick probably actually good you. don’t want get bad sick. That’s vaccines  know I'm told people work local hospitals, apparently there's barely enough reserve cover normal need. words, hospitals maintain tiny reserve open beds best circumstances (5-10%) idea emergency arrangements made event disaster greatly increases need (so conversion regular beds trauma, hiring additional temporary staff, cancellation elective surgeries, etc). that's happened already. Hospitals across country already running 110 - 140% technical capacity, converted every available bed, started treating people hallways, cancelling non-emergency care. There's nowhere go absorb continuing increase covid cases many places. beds reserve vaccinated people. cut minimum expected need, free beds covid patients happen present care time minimum expected number vaccinated, non covid related emergency need patients there, there's nowhere put someone dies discharged. quality care folks compromised, discharges happening sooner normal, help make room.
 
That's happened kid, waited hours someone make room him. Covid pushed hospitals across country use every bit theoretical capacity have, make difficult choices reduce theoretical ""reserve"" order make room patients presenting emergency need care covid. show non covid emergency need kind, luck, right along side additional covid people coming in.  time start refusing care unvaccinated covid patients, free beds again. Triage thing now, rationed care, hospitals across country, unvaccinated lowest priority. Bruh wish made infertile Lmaoo I’m replying comment article. you’re trash turning demeaning, even person front made mistake it’s helping type convo. Guess working emotional intelligence included US education system huh. Singapore, like many countries, opening travel countries situation relatively stable. idea kind agenda think play here. There's son college got sore throat stuffy nose, got tested negative. Friend mine's kid 16 high school, thing, got symptoms, tested covid, negative. seasonal colds flus too. Every respiratory illness covid. Exactly. I’m impression people get vaccinated. can’t health reasons certainly wear N95 mask - meanwhile us vaccinated people go mask free. NY one too, also accept paper cards. Would unfortunate didn’t since can’t use system state NYC ton commuters. Weird werent offered already. Canada 12+ whole time part problem caused nurses quitting jobs? blame them.  hospitalization rate actually different pediatric age group. example 0 4 age group consistently lowest case per 100,000 rates pediatric age groups, unfortunately age group also consistently highest hospitalization per 100,000 rates.

The chance COVID positive 0-4 gets admitted hospital actually 1 50, 2%. I’m sure sinovax equivalent many good vaccines.  “freedom advocates” always obsessed controlling peoples choices?

Not really question. manipulated handful rich people told COVID flu; rich people cared keeping economy going making sure pockets stay filled. 1 billion 70% population. they're ""getting woods yet"" stage.

Also hard lockdowns limited couple regions clusters. country locked down. Fatalities among kids very, very, rare. less 500 deaths due covid age 18. 685k deaths (0.07%) population 74 million (0.0007%).

500 deaths many perspective 3 times many kids die every year swimming pool accidents.

I think fair say kids schools risk rest public. tiny fraction. Japan, thought gargling iodine normal. wanted buy iodine pet first aid kit, vet suggested safe disinfectant, trouble finding iodine meant wound disinfecting, meant gargling (the kind eventually found bought says gargle it, however).  Especially considering what’s happening Texas right now, TERRIBLE take. see it. see everyday read charts who's vaxxed isn't. know better lied to. Funny random moron calls nurse carol Twitter Frontline worker us morons listen to. actual nurses say I've seen what's going want shot pushing yet. They're dumbasses see. Fuck everything.

I great solution this. military set medical tents across country. COVID cases roll in, get transfered emergency shelter meet certain metrics recovery. 

Step 2 simple, publicize effort. Make extremely clear unvaccinated transferred government run center hospitalized. Fox news spread outrage big government overreach, drive vaccine numbers. True. 

I can't believe I've hit point I'd rather think they're 'just' money power kills, money, power. :(

By way big fan vaccine ounce prevention perfect hospitals stretched little thin. Exactly. I’m terrified kids getting it. “Kids survive covid” idgaf Shannon! still long term effects survive! huge problem someone renting extra house. someone becoming rich without working contributing anything society, problem. numbers actual illness among kids rather cases? Statistically kids gets sick far less often adults. Ehh, think read somewhere saying try get JNJ one ""made baby fetuses"", nonsense. mean right... one downvoted read article would seen update article California regressed back high Unfortunately can't commit people death lack intelligence hence mess **GOP large homicidal cult** everywhere. New England well. I'm actually surprised NE states category. never understood get attention. estimated every reported case, 5 cases. anytime test anywhere find cases. And, find cases, everyone gets concerned gets tested. becomes self-reinforcing cycle. Conversely, test whatever reason find cases. number cases public remains same.

I’m worried Canadian education system, right now. teaching maple bros there? 😳 Yeah, hubby needs new friend!  live US shots probably free much longer.

A. government can't afford it. (They never tax rich)

B. soon Republicans take back Congress and/or White House (which *will* happen eventually since voters dumb) stop paying it.

It's going insurance companies cover costs guarantee completely cover cost future boosters. probably never berated anybody vaccinated flu. likely even care categorize people way, probably even ask
   

I never berated anyone I’ve numerous conversations many people real life online benefits vaccines. I’ve convinced people get flu shots even Covid. I’ve talked people MMR shots bad anti-vaccine ‘research’ even paper retracted. I’ve talked people importance updating tetanus shot least every 10 years, especially garden/farm interact livestock. I’ve found resources kids wanted get vaccinated hadn’t able parents anti-vaxxers.
   completely fine millions Americans running around maskless unvaccinated, spreading flu
   

No, wasn’t never happy people spreading disease dying, keep lying helps sleep better night. restaurants either shooting foot limiting dine revenue closing together?

These restaurant owners fallen deep Q bullshit instead ""choosing respect privacy security clients"". They've basically decided they'll risk going business altogether scan frigging QR code somehow that's Big Brother handle. Basically, someone hospital bed, doctor responsibility treat them, cant kick bed. took care accepted responsibility treatment.  think non-insignificant number parents worry style dormant acute infection, issue later life kids. 

My wife cancer survivors. means something gene pool regarding immune system bit shallow. twin 6yo's need every available advantage. They're wonderful healthy kids, fam doctor page. Vaccinate EVERYTHING. cant wait personally Yes lose sleep going school. wife far headcase it. antivax treated opt-out non-private healthcare. Wasn’t argument, genuine question. I’m vaccinated… Hospitals need start leaving capacity normal shit. Enough enough. Well, probably, ignoring mandate army generally wise course action consequences.

If people like told do, probably joined army.... Folks point could lease renewal, sufficient? 


I would expect Fair Housing Act make impossible enforce. Someone could simply make fake doctor's note (but real doctor's name it) saying cannot get vaccine, would absolutely nothing landlord unless willing call tenant's bluff court (and note turns real, get lot trouble...) Ooooh there’s gonna lot mad blue collars scientific (non political) consensus population testing college campuses? seems like (prestigious? wealthy? northern?) universities repeatedly mass testing students, even high vaccination rates? course finding ""asymptomatic outbreaks"". seems predictable.

 
So...is mass testing logical? end goal mass population testing vaccinated populations? policies universities driven science...or politics? Vaccinated people substantially less likely develop long covid says study released **this genuinely expect fold particular issue. akin Texas adopting vaccine certificate program. bit shame waited province already 100% ICU capacity. likely could meaningful impact case numbers implemented earlier wave. But, better late never. woman vaccinated pregnancy give birth child passive immunity virus. Get shot!    think stereotype Dutch cheap would come play least, guess pandering anti-vaxxers important.    signed pharmacy’s website asked first, second, third shot (immune compromised). 

I selected third, filled insurance info, scheduled it. 

When showed up, pharmacist asked first second dose. said third, said okay asked ID vaccine card. 

She said take seat, waited 5 min got third jab (6 months previous). 

That’s it. part data considered boosters, however ahead never vaccinated spreading covid filling hospitals. Even delta, even now, vaccinated make small percentage cases. going grow bad things. deaths cause sort meaningful change lives around them. 

I think that's I'd spin ""he plan""/""everything happens reason"" religious type. make silliness like can't accept horrible things happen. room full 10 unvaccinated people, let’s say 5 get Covid. 5 go spread 5 people per infected. total 30 infected spread 5 more, etc. That’s called exponential growth. 

On opposite end, room 10 fully vaccinated people 1 gets Covid (the actual percentage breakthrough cases much lower 1/10 sake explaining it) 1 person go spread 5. total 6 infected instead 30. 

Obviously vaccinated people, less people Covid spread to. instead 130K new cases, 7k new cases spread throughout US. Healthcare workers however even worse deal patients often immunocompromised, susceptible diseases. actively hurting putting patients high risk Gonna lot constipated idiots going around finally booked first trip since pandemic started last year New York. hotel emailed need bring proof vaccination, let stay. going problem. idiot troll thread spewing crap.  also mandated 2 year old wear masks France less.

Watching school district’s covid dashboard interesting. first steady increase cases schools, numbers stabilizing. 

The high schools highest numbers consistently. find frustrating since students could vaccinated.   okay, let die hill ignorance. self-resolving problem. meet requirements requirements 501(c)(3) *were specifically designed include them*.

If religion invisible government churches play rules everyone else, churches would spend profits charity, money funneled single individual small group (sorry, televangelists!), would stop political activity, able engage discriminatory practices cause discriminatory purpose, they'd serve public need, etc.

Ain't interfering *duvahn prahwvdunce* too? immune. stretches beyond spreading virus. Hospital overcrowding means someone could potentially take bed non-covid infected person may need, potential long lasting side-effects even surviving Covid, etc.

I'm understanding argument correctly, reason anti-vaxxers hostile towards vaccine belong racial group traditionally forced government things, context understand actually norm big deal. 
 
I dispute many anti-vaxxers actually _do_ belong racial group subject many government demands. Black Americans _do_ context alleging white Americans lack, yet they're reacting similar ways.  
 
I think better explanation lack education, specifically lack education leaves vulnerable conspiracy theories. accounts poor white Americans _and_ poor Black Americans resistant vaccine, groups various historical reasons able receive high quality educations. also accounts rich white conservatives, like former President staff Fox News, personally rushed get vaccine despite publicly sowing doubt it, white privileged means they're highly educated therefore know vaccine legit. explain NY ton people done it, including lot people know ( though me). boosters approved ANYONE, said million people U.S. gotten third dose ( presumably lying).

* Person 1: fact article reality? complete speculation think we're seeing lot testing schools causes artificial inflation cases compared summer. elementary school kids vaccinated, they're likely spread largely vaccinated adult population. school started up, *of course* disruption testing/cases.

Hospitalization less volatile. Remember. think hospitalizations begun drop New Jersey. graph linked measures effectiveness specifically **not** efficacy. here's relevant bit CDC vaccine effectiveness studies differ vaccine efficacy efficacy refers vaccine protection measured optimal conditions vaccine storage delivery monitored participants usually healthy. Vaccine efficacy determined RCTs, usually clinical trials. Vaccine effectiveness measures well vaccine works real-world conditions.

If flu shot 39% effective like 2019-2020, would 60% effective reducing serious illness 39 every 100 people given shot. 23.4% real world conditions. 

I'm saying get flu shot FYI (I get mine every year), saying kinda suck intense manufacturing challenges face. mRNA vaccines could finally address problem amazing. true. booked test Sunday night Tuesday morning recently.

TL;DR cuts chance long COVID half breakthrough infections vs unvaccinated Researchers study hypothesized indirect effects quarantines, closures, unemployment may exacerbated incidence severity disease. actually lot reason believe third shot, immunity last longer previous two shots. Studies showing spacing shots matter long break shots tend produce robust immune responses.

SF NYC similar high vaccination rates SF instituted new mask mandate summer NYC not. delta curves metro areas nearly identical. 

You even go way NYC. San Diego County Monterey County delta curves similar SF delta curve, despite SF county mask mandate. 

Once vaccination rate gets high enough, really seeing real world difference data masking. Vaccines important things listed. protect vaccinated treated something else covid hospital personel treating freedom fighters?  talk $50 like think poorest person simply afford it. realistic.  lot people die car accidents every year. amount car accidents would cause fatalities would drop significantly speed limit lowered everywhere max 20mph. many lives would saved every year, think it! county luckily overrun cases rural area, doubt others experience same. checked county's vaccination rates while, know waaaay people getting pokes last weeks compared back July.

It's good experiencing total failure overload hospital!  It’s insane. fair however, Intermectin something prescribed humans - orally topically. different dosage different conditions. 

No evidence impact COVID prevent treatment. Exponential growth. Fuck medical workers refuse vaccines. swore Hippocrates' oath. Lessen chance transmit covid get fuck find another profession. Although you’re right effect, numbers far apart. People antibodies SARS MERS marginal numbers, people COVID. number rises, good, costs much medical resources. virus less infectious, less people would get it, less medical resources would needed everybody would able get antibodies.

They wasting money studies it. Egyptian study showed worked.

Of course study fraudulent, studies still ongoing. preliminary results good. She’s right something something vaccines something something masks Let's revisit original statement: ""For lower class saying indoor dining long foreseeable""

This implies poor/working class people cannot afford ever eat out. 

You can't move goal posts ""the poor can't afford eat month, that."" Working class people largely avoiding eating indoors insulting assume they're poor go Applebee's month. 

The way Reddit describes working class people frankly, bit insulting. know budget money, take family meal month. parents it, neighbors it, almost every working class family know it. insulting assume working class people bad money meal month Applebees unattainable dream. helps everyone else medical industry longer around unvaccinated individuals, risking health. Contrary popular belief, hard information get China. covid problem there, would known.  still what? What’s point?  CA schools generally opened later though. want smug waiting couple weeks relax. Correlation doesn’t mean causation, correct. But, fact that’s correlation continued every study used openly results showing efficacy improvement within covid related cases, that’s worth “it’s horse paste” response. Plus, YEARS use proven incredibly safe new type vaccine. I’m open science, ones government tells care plan forever, either, think necessary that. I'm sure times masks go back public local outbreak, get background noise point.

I work small town ED. wait times historically less 90mins. people waiting 7-8 hours seen, waiting days bed hospital another. sorry it’s Darwinism action - thinning herd - suited survival , harsh I’m sorry it’s nature
Repubs dying group imagine obesity imposes similar burden health care. 

both covid somewhat mitigated, apply common sense. Texas here. month we’ve hit last years COVID numbers one month sons school district.
73,749 vs 148,197 last year state wide. Yes: dilute povidone iodine, dilute hydrogen peroxide, concentrated ethanol effective antiseptics. No, increase dumbass. 20?

I’m planning 0. You’re wet.   offensive? Running randomized controlled trials slow expensive, understanding several ongoing trials investigating povidone iodine oral/nasal rinse, yet reported results.

In vitro, dilute povidone iodine effective killing SARS-CoV2 wide variety viruses (not mention bacteria, etc.). problem York accepts vaccines approved either World Health Organization America’s federal Food Drug Administration.""

The Sputnik vaccine many vaccines used around world (e.g. Cuban vaccines, chinese like CanSino, India Covaxin, etc ) yet list, recognized New York authorities. Two years crap still trying get basics down? We've known since beginning. Probably it’s living vs. dying. It’s also possibility long term symptoms Covid.

Besides, information doesn’t account Delta. Here! right point. US Western countries recognize people vaccinated Sputnik V vaccinated, Russia newer disclosed testing protocols vaccine. retaliation, Russia recognize Pfz-Bnt, Moderna A-Z. 

So, much bigger issues, UN assembly level. completely support measures. probably saved many lives. husband tested positive last July, tested weekly 3 months finally got negative test. Oh man, would sucked isolated long though. [Moderna's vaccine expensive vaccine per increase prices even [sales Pfizer’s shot hit $56bn Moderna’s reaching already taken two doses, hell, obviously pharmacompanies want sell even more, gambled spent lot money research, fine, point make big money, shown source above. 

Data early 2021 still shows people got two doses gradually weakening protection symptomatic disease, still incredibly high levels protection hospitalization death, main thing think about. Please, Jesus. simple tool 76% fully vaccinated. never actually quite simple waves come go, still. reported data article accurate, amazing. Beijing population 21.9 million.  
        97% adults capital Beijing fully vaccinated.... Yeah wish mandates would cover restaurants too. That's 100% economic decision one based around public health. I’m really familiar geopolitics Canada, Alberta basically Canada’s version Texas? Thank god Australias lockdowns. lucky. simple though. could still transmit breakthrough infection child can't get vaccinated yet. could infected even know it.

A day come soon lose masks. hospitals literally overflowing cases time. terrible bad get.

Yet Australia nothing like people going nuts they're allowed go pub.  Certainly rest lives 1000-2000 people still dying every day Covid time taking masks yet. US 100% vaccinated, cares virus still spreading (I’m talking US only)? thing we’ve concerned serious illness death cause covid, vaccine effective minimizing serious symptoms death low enough level, threat we’ve (not counting potential mutation, there’s nothing that). Still seems exceptional high me. live gated condo community Africa 5000 tenants. masks, vaccinations, weekly church packed same. Several people died cancer, single Covid death. fact, single person hospitalized it. Appendix burst back spring 2019. sympathize kid. Mine burst way hospital. I'm lucky around time else may dead problem?

edit: reason

""New York accepts vaccines approved either World Health Organization America’s federal Food Drug Administration.""

Sputnik many vaccines used around world (e.g. Cuban) yet list, recognized New York authorities. need masks hospitals overflowing Covid patients case numbers down.

If stick seatbelt analogy, right car's driving along 100 mph cases still high. time taking seatbelt. 

Once slow 5mph might worth risk. believe unless you’re 12 legitimate health reason can’t get vaccine, you’re forfeiting rights treated Covid you’ve refused shot. worth people actually take safety precautions seriously, clear. Early pandemic laughed taking seriously. mean shit maybe didn’t asthma wouldn’t taken seriously. Probably would though, mid twenties (now husband) caught terrible flu, possibly swine flu, honestly felt pretty close death then. 

But also glad know know, vaccines.  turned away vaccinated, brought themselves, fucking morons.  earth get governments act this? reason can't get one? Per CDC, allergic mRNA vaccines able get J&amp;J vaccine, vice Miss iss ipp iiiiiiiiiiii CDC guidance intended apply environments everyone’s vaccination status known. everyone given space vaccinated, it’s different story. CDC separately recommend vaccinated people mask private gatherings vaccinated people only. apt metaphor can’t unvaccinated put back waitlist? They’re spreading infectious disease… purpose Sadly think argument makes perfect sense. hope reforms better triage patients, even means making tough case case decisions. Yeah, right. regret response. rage feel actively killing people overrides heart sometimes. anger misdirected. Nevertheless, stand phrase ""You going reap sow."" statement fact, value judgement. blame bad virus spread killing people disproportionately found Mason Dixon line. people Kentucky deserve die, mean actions killing other.  knows avoided asymptomatic-infected vaccinated people well? Biden administration needs step implement preventative measures shut transmission virus provide financial incentives drive vaccination rates. Anything else making excuses dead children hands Biden. really shame. promising well-designed product. corruption politics allowed supersede technical facts… guarantee nurses non-covid floors. 

Regardless, trust science.  I've trouble finding info conditions genuinely can't get COVID-19 vaccine due health risks. please share info specific conditions? look death count vs. seroprevalence rate calculate CFR. Kenya (where live) comes CFR 0.02%.

And Folrida way average weird me. There's still shortage medical issues. two chronic diseases pro vax even that. (Also I'm already autistic. 😛) somehow diseases vaccinate away seem different category. patients paying price under-staffed, under-funded healthcare systems around world. idea, guess, trauma response. Everybody’s scarred masks mean different things different people. Plus, Reddit Reddit loves pile on. turn notifications remember none people know influence life. Ultimately know what’s best you. 500 allies/Americans stranded Afghanistan, well that's better thousands, right? Oof.

I mean, choose standing 500 thousands, would choose?

You're saying standing less people better? think trying go ""oh, less, ok?"" didn't. fucked fallacious argument. one said ok. They're saying better alternative. literally fucked argument providing actual correct answer even realize it.  That's already works many countries. Sweden, buy apartment buy share building, apartment normally need live it... sounds good? really. Sweden's housing market disaster. First new versions vaccine could developed changing spike protein form closer delta, whatever strain dominant time. doesnt necessary current vaccine still protects CEO BioNTech, German company developed COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer, told DW biotech firm's existing treatment likely work newly discovered, contagious strain virus. new vaccine would ""technically"" take six weeks develop, says Ugur Sahin, mandatory testing means would much longer could used inoculate people. maybe mean future proofing means developing vaccine region virus change easily mutations. areas ways virus could change otherwise would loose ability function. Heres example company inovio May 2021, Inovio announced results preclinical studies “pan-SARS-CoV-2” DNA vaccine (INO-4802) plans initiate phase I/II studies. vaccine incorporates common overlapping mutations several SARS-COV-2 variants concern isolated several different countries including Brazil India. school near make masks mandatory Monday protest outside school Monday morning lol 

Like whatever 1. live area currently 40% vaccinated. 2. told multiple doctors/nurses/other hospital staff hospitals overwhelmed COVID patients. 3. Every news station area reporting overwhelmed hospital system unvaccinated COVID patients. 4. Literally every bit evidence currently showing least 90% hospitalized COVID patients unvaccinated. 

Please go make dumbass straw man argument somewhere else. exactly ward mother Covid early January way even got close getting vaccine(late April) man weird month would hear mom coughing able breathe properly hall. contagious entire time Oxygen. still fucking understand dad get took care us mom rough spot weeks. really feel sorry anyone deal shit fucking ass brutal fight back from. understand anyone returns two weeks rough shape it. Get vaccinated.  Antivaxers: Selfish Generation  Remember CDC decided safe burn masks? turn out? evolutionary pressure something ""measured"" per individual whole ecosystem.

Yes, people getting vaccinated increases pressure virus habitat shrinking. like cutting forest. less forest is, less likely something living forest survive.

And forest analogy goes even further: forest cut slowly enough, animals living inside forest given time evolve live outside forest.

And biggest problem anti-vaxxers: breeding grounds virus (they infected strongly longer periods time, giving virus opportunity mutations accumulate infect people). matter time mutation occurs get around anti-bodies vaccine (and also Covid immune system reacts spike protein). start whole process getting new vaccine developed again.

The longer shitty situation goes on, higher probability is, mutation occurs.

Oh, way: delta variant good example mutation need vaccinated people. first identified India December 2020. Long anyone vaccinated. happened structure makes less likely identified immune system people already covid vaccinated it. see it. refuse read view anything goes current beliefs. They've turned anti-vaccine religion, positions based belief echo chamber reinforces it.    young children  Delta already killed healthy kids starting run schools, many mask mandates. best information I've heard Delta 1,000 times virulent wild type sars cov2. Many parts country experiencing new cases deaths time last year, even vaccine available. Delta killing unvaccinated. want kids protected, try minimize that. Many people want play politics virus, virus care politics wants unvaccinated hosts. McClure, 23, hairstylist nearby Clinton suspicious conflicting information she’s heard try watch news. get Facebook,” said McClure. “I really try talk work it’s like politics: don’t talk politics pray’

How even reach people like this? saying antivaxers antimaskers may even dumber now? Holy crap Pope vocally pro-vaxx. settle right there. sure changes anything, masks required indoors Vegas casinos. So, effects risk tolerance, something consider. WA, voted govt back record election win opposition fit single van. outright control houses, something never expected see.

There's trust that. Literally gave power reform whole system elected - that. Launched independent expert review system, lead one [most barristers WA, followed top recommendations allow representative/fairer democratic elections upper house going forward.

So far seem misplaced. There's 9 deaths disease state. average American state, there'd 5500. Mississippi level? 8000. we've done that, saved multiple 9/11s whilst normal schools, normal jobs, normal entertainment nightlife friendships whole last year. whilst able vaccinate *before* exposed disease.

We generally consider lucky this, yes must hope continue abuse trust placed them. understand others would concerned government virus actually killing people.    pulmonologist PCP sure allergic reaction vaccine component extreme immune response. held several hours hospital received first dose immediate reaction (not anaphylaxis). rushed ER work days second dose. missed four months work recovering fallout. Lol line said, “it could incredible blow economy” double take. talking millions loosing apart thats concern. Smh France.

Quakers really awesome progressive, going back fight abolition. I'm favor continuing mask mandate, least indoors; however, political point view, impossible continue enforcing long. Thus, politicians find way letting people get back sort ""normal"" discontent boil over. Earlier thread article information Amish highly impacted earlier waves disease. 

JW anti-vaccine. They're anti blood transfusion. official teaching vaccine matter personal preference. twice death rate. Nicki Minaj gives hard off. weird haven’t mass firings yet.

3000 lot workers, know France, US always shortage. irritating people probably hoping pressure cause get vaccinated come back.  wealthy people get privilege live around unvaccinated. I'm wealthy live, shop, business, work unvaccinated. landlord kicks unvaccinated out, make disappear. makes someone else's problem, almost certain someone poorer community economic ability ""not back yard"" unvaccinated. moral stand landlord making. merely passing buck unvaccinated onto people, almost certainly poorer less powerful communities power kick unvaccinated themselves.  fully expect this. expect wealthy vaccinated people kick unvaccinated people communities make problem us poor vaccinated people, believe making moral stand, reality, making societal problem issue poor vaccinated people deal instead. MRI look lesions? friend got COVID ended something looks like really bad MS. doctors still undecided it’s case COVID triggering MS (fairly common MS happen someone gets virus) it’s something new COVID post-viral disease.

Or even better let’s moderna test Pfizer’s vaccine report back Pfizer test moderna’s along third party. Maybe reporting horrible instills confidence anyone involved.

All vaccine getting ridiculous. already require immigrants dose ivermectin too.  OTOH, hospital full, sooner free bed better...they bother something simple walking closest pharmacy getting shot, they're taking bed, staff, resources. sympathy.  absolutely true. people knowingly disseminating misinformation political reasons economic gain, they're ones might enjoy seeing succumb. they're probably smart enough get vaxed, even admit it.  valid reason Catholic person receive religious exemption?

No. Dutch Reformed church rooted Calvinist Protestant movement, hold tenet ""sola scriptura"" Bible religious text.

The Bible nothing say vaccines directly. vast majority Christian churches made pro-vaccine statements. those, theological underpinning seems considered Jesus' greatest commandment, ""love thy neighbor."" may, think metaphor may help?

Think last year's covid-19 classic apple pie (wild-type alpha). Lots people got pretty popular starting March 2020. masking social distancing recommendations came mortality rates spiked people stayed away apple pie around Fourth July ('Murrica) saw resurgence popularity. died bit people remembered it, got popular holidays. thing classic apple good, good people resist taking slice went around others it.

Now last fall/holiday season covid-19 like hey, I'm great classic apple pie, lets go Dutch Apple everyone loves crumble topping seems crushing India. Dutch apple Delta.

So Dutch Apple Delta (DAD) comes US early March 2021. people enjoyed classic apple, they're going absolutely gangbusters DAD. based classic apple, additional things (crumble topping = spike protein mutations) makes much popular (communicable). similar **but different** product. DAD evolved classic apple properties plus new features own. 

That's talking about: two related, different products one next generation. That's papers sourced data pertaining last year's classic apple (wild-type alpha) necessarily great resources talking Dutch Apple hit store shelves year. situations contexts different, conclusions last year's research necessarily valid year's concerns.   original doses Pfizer moderna 30 100 micrograms, respectively. half dose moderna booster would 50 micrograms, so, closer Pfizer still 1.66x dose, *quite* insignificant difference. Church Flying Spaghetti Monster cares deeply adherents encourages vaccines. want protection less protection?

I protected people around get vaccinated. protected people around world vaccinated, reducing chance new vaccine-resistant variants showing up. extra percentage ""personal protection"" important grand scheme things. Customers employees bars, wineries, breweries, nightclubs lounges least one vaccine dose Oct. 7 doses Nov. 4. apply indoor restaurants recommended.

So safer dine work restaurant businesses better lobbyists restrictions little public safety?

Many still wonder skepticism virus vaccines. Rumi says 'suffering extend life.'  confuses people want religious exemption. True, real Texas still doubling prohibiting mask mandates, let alone vaccine mandates. least step right direction, albeit far many steps wrong direction. Admitting wrong direction first step things starting improve Alberta. “We strongly object people proof vaccination admitted GA hall,” Nebenzia wrote letter seen described “a clearly discriminatory measure”, adding preventing delegates access hall “clear violation UN charter”.

Puritan. think trump rallies flipped Georgia.

insomuch killed enough r3publicans? Total deaths due COVID GA 8500. vote spread shy 12000. would need COVID deaths undercounted 1.5x every one voting r3publicans. everyone votes early on, deaths concentrated among urban minority folks. R3publicans start ""pro-COVID"" measures first wave started subside. Early spread rather neutral party, see difference November vs January special election stats

There's major things different. Trump actually ballot January. Additionally, literally $1400 line. hard Democrats hit park Trump lobbed softball like special election. 👏🏻🐴  need wall  What’s difference Presbyterian reformed Dutch reformed? BIL pastor PCA moderna vaccine, pregnant wife got j&amp;j. bonus €100 insultingly low. meant thousand. months wages something like that. Yes, comparing wrong figure.  Engineers too. know care hearing say quit rather vaccinated even tested. Thanks China. put “Christian” cite fact R&amp;D vaccines done fetal cell lines derived aborted fetus, case J&amp;J, fetal cell lines aborted fetus used production vaccine.

Of course come two aborted fetuses 70s, people probably line monoclonal antibody therapy also involved fetal cell lines early research.

My take: need either develop vaccines don’t let use excuse, straight get rid religious exemption. It’s impossible police sincere public interest completely outweighs coddling people case.   fact - countries left behind become pocket new strain arises - making vaccination efforts less useful. need start treating earths' population one population. virus respect borders - need stop seeing borders many reasons. Environmental, viral, human rights, list goes on..

The need direct boosters  Definitely healthcare workers. religious beliefs preclude vaccination, better find different job line religion.

For general population, *personally* think religious exemptions nonsense. public health crisis. also recognize subject reasonable people disagree potential infringement conscience. previous health crises, number unvaccinated small herd immunity usually still achieved. time, though, anti-vax views seemingly entangled politics, fear heavier hand may required, much saddens me.

There opposition polio vaccine extremists like John Birch Society back 50s, fairly small fringe, reach internet. Vaccine resistance never became partisan issue. people lined get soon possible, without need government mandate clearly beneficial, polio clearly horrible. know happened people's critical faculties last 70 years.  lot Muslim friends say religion bans confuses me.   reinforcement Governor Hochul’s statement: fact article reality? seeing warnings TV broadcast states basically saying ""DO ride bicycle get hurt, may able go ER""..

I guess applies EVERYTHING - construction, driving, etc. CAREFUL live states. Thank you. Long crazy day work, exact smile needed! can't celebrate death came decades late vaccine get? when? Christians, loudest objection fetal cell lines originated abortion 60s one 70s (I believe). becomes (false) claim recently aborted babies vaccines filled cells contributing abortions taking vaccine, antithetical beliefs held types people.

This view particular based bullshit facebook posts make people think abortions tied vaccines, never case. Vaccines, masks, social distancing. things *do* work, people.

I'm Bay area, entire school district fewer 20 COVID cases, thought contracted outside school. SF school district, 63,000 students staff, 260 total cases. one person count? know vaccine lessens risk long Covid 50%,…..but amount breakthrough cases, certainly rare, hell lot vaccinated people get it. That’s point. unvaccinated definitely get infected spread. Hospitals large source infection. need minimize internal spread infection much possible.

A vaccinated health care worker plus mask much, much, much safer work unvaccinated worker. you’re willing get fired vaccine. You’re going get vaccinated $100, whatever want award with. Yeah, don’t know. isn’t really way knowing since aren’t really asking sorts questions.  Chick I’ve making tested positive Covid Pfizer saw yesterday. Odds getting Covid?

&amp;#x200B;

You convince people get vaccinated without threatening home... would say since studies showing within community hesitancy stems various factors includes mistrust surrounding historical mistreatment systematic racism primary concern statement really hold true. Capitalism Same. healthcare US amazing bank balance. It’s insane. You’re literally reading equivalent notes right now. Yes. good. Unfortunately, China's vaccine seem anywhere near good Pfizer Moderna shots. Ergo, there's probably lots breakthrough infections, spreading around virus even vaccinated unvaccinated. also true third world nations China helps vaccine. Yes, still net benefit getting people vaccinated China's shots. wish shots higher quality.

From I've seen news reports, Russia's vaccine may similar China's effectiveness, too. :-| big Dutch Reform population around live. 

There's big Dutch Reform population NYC, considering official church New Amsterdam. grew congregation grandmother one first women ordained minister tradition. point vaccine skepticism antagonism towards science ever part theology grandmother never expressed iota discomfort getting full panoply vaccines needed public school. China also travel restrictions. It’s completely sealed people go China every day, need valid reason good enough Chinese. 

For European, going US limits going China, countries travel restrictions Europeans.  wouldn’t blame vaccinated they’ve done reduce risk killing people, whereas unvaccinated not. immigrated decade ago make get *ALL* vaccines. paperwork got messed take tetanus twice! So, yeah, it’s non-issue.  Good point India, mutation evade vaccines (which afraid of)

Seems like mutation boost viral load infect people. thread obviously fast food sit restaurants cook food fresh. Sorry happened dude stuff scary No, based science probability. people choose do. opinion much based fear real assessment actual risk. Australians much culture individual freedoms.

Even canada used go long relaxing drives stay home order cops never cared.

Causing going drive covid risk lol Cities churches too.

And large congregations lot larger. ""Defensive pessimist."" like steal :) Serious question: people keep citing “well don’t know booster protection last” reason deploy em masse, actually think likely opposite outcome, boosters add durably long term immunity don’t wane much time?

Reason ask Moderna’s extra protection longer interval seems paying dividends back end, it’s protection baseline, seems waning slowly Pfizer. wonder get exponential gains booster, simple “add x protection”.  definitely personal perspective one, Islam centric nations seem approved vaccines either government stance seems public health focused technology behind concern. original response intended perspective direct response original question small subset people may refuse medical treatments due specific considerations haha Duke Amherst news this. Thanks info! sure, appreciate THANK YOU, sure expect, great reaction second shot much better covid 10000% want brace lol lol, second shot messed 4-5 days stomach stuff 3 weeks need plan nothing bit. Also keep going saying wait 8 months second shot 6 months sure correct timing one. long ago second one? cvs know 3rd shot? Thanks information helping lot!!! :) think kind bullshit praise heroes one day refuse allow work cause suck.

They gone carrot instead stick approach given covid bonus every frontline healthcare worker redeemable vaccinated. God knows deserve past 18 months.

This basically insulting everyone, even vaccinated health workers, calling expendable hospitals longer overflowing. Fair enough. I'm not, we've always known vaccines 100%, important vaccine EVERYONE. many antivaxxers there, contagious Delta is, sad fact we're going see stories time goes on.

Normally, I'd say antivaxxers freeloaders risks others take help achieve herd immunity, think going escape end. COVID contagious. asymptomatic case breakthrough also still helping weaken chain viral load lower decays faster. work. understand vaccines work? Vaccines create magical barrier prevents microorganism entering body. teaches body recognize certain pathogen mount immune response sooner, gives huge advantage/head start fighting pathogen. nice thought all, anti-vaccination also huge Black community. see ""white privilege"" explanation accounts isn't, come on.

On one hand, wonder anti-vax people say years anti-vax nonsense obviously that: nonsense. going say anything vaccinated people alive healthy, babies going life time?

And come senses. No, course won't.

Statistically know vast majority people get illness survive. lot get long Covid downplay symptoms avoid admitting wrong downplay virus. enough cover people avoid admit mistaken, probably won't.

Ironically, greatest hopes come Biden's vaccine mandates. happens, I'm hoping knock two myths once: myth vaccine side effects myth big government boogeyman wants strap shoot full chemicals. hope 10 years -- neither myth come pass -- people little smarter wiser. I'm holding breath. got vaccine soon possible one people heavy reactions second dose. Even brain fog days second dose. I'm convinced real covid would've totally made one long coviders bad shape. glad I'm vaccinated.  Give month swallow pride get shot. Money brings back. recall election totaled meme.. possibly anything California residents blindly vote republican candidate. opposition joke. Go outside LA Bay area Newsome almost universally hated. He's mismanaged one powerful economies world simultaneously driving life long residents big business states. one paying home mortgage, property tax vehicle registration state supports managed. less effective vaccination

I wonder COVID-19 variolation would actually significantly effective vaccination? include Afghan refugees? heard many refused vaccines based religion. There's also measles outbreaks several refugee camp locations US right now. I'm glad getting help, nothing coming here, seems like would smart make vaccinations part immigration process.  seem conservative people, black community also vaccinated due different reasons. people getting first shot every day still. 900k per day. lot compared vaccines first came available zero. 6k people got first shot on-site could attend NFL game. like choice, borders closed. Well that's probably Cali low rates lol. states commenter referring to. enough Texas Florida actively try make worse.  Well, yes. society already fairly antisocial. masked. I've always seen it, frankly.

That's *why* asocial. antisocial. asociality protect oneself. Antisocial completely different people tend misconstrue asociality antisocial. Society large always exceedingly antisocial violent.

I think everything end, we're certainly rocky ride. end some, that's travesty. think judge people becoming asocial things disturbed. antisocial ones look for.  English great. understood intent appreciate information shared. innocent people dying anti-vaxxers loaded gun shot them. 

A natural extension anger innocent people dying completely justified anger scorn directed people prolonging pandemic killing them. 

At point sympathy them. facts fingertips. Every major newspaper country free non-pay-walled pandemic coverage. *chose* uninformed like idea wrong ""team"" misled them. That's profoundly stupid thing gamble life on.  “You must wait!!! SCIENCE!!!” Availability doses issue anymore. debate vaccination bit different e.g. US Canada. See (very long!) comment thread late. 

In Sweden thinking much ""we deal next decade anyway, correct long term policy"". necessarily agree it, thinking. Also, medical profession consensus deeply imorral give vaccines limit spread. every individual argue benefit individual. think FHM (health agency) really would like look spread, know start vaccinations limit spread met shitstorm angry high ranking doctors telling immoral. always able argue individual safety. understand carrot. Funny government refuses even admit it’s happening. zero chance police stop using software - already used purposes.

We’ve managed many countries quarantine require level surveillance.  narrow case vaccines manufactured using researches based human fetus, could become barrier halal considerations. think I've seen come covid vaccines, think past. friend's co-worker died Covid yesterday. 40s underlying health issues weight problems. left behind wife two kids. vaccinated.

Two weeks ago, buddy lost friend also 40s underlying health issues weight problems. also left behind wife two kids. also vaccinated.

It amazes face big percentage population simply refuses get vaccinated. pointless frustrating. mom dad like this, believe body fight covid want vaccinated. spent long time trying convince safer everyone get vaccinated, nope, really want hear it. may good long term purge idiots workforce. Anyone actually needed job worked like needed job got shot.  line something? Dated someone used say time  anti-vaxxers anything say it!  I'm supposed go Tennessee 4 weeks idk want anymore good. need workers replacements sight. cannot get workers thin air. 

That things gotten show sad state affairs countries. Wrong. grew rural area Louisiana.

That experience all.
In urban area like 10 grocery stores could choose go within 20 minute drive. Honestly probably that.

In rural area grew two options. within 20-minute drive all. One super Walmart others straight 1980s small aisles.

While ones rural areas slower periods, they're also busier right work experience. urban areas lot people different schedules. Rural areas tend revolve around work periods. 

Going grocery store real areas definitely social thing too. going without stopping talk people know. go ER couple weeks ago later found severe food poisoning going multiple days. spent four half hours waiting room going bathroom every fifteen thirty minutes passing blood stool. whole time, listening people waiting room cough, could think was, maybe I’m overreacting, maybe go home pass own, fly across state lines get care, etc etc. weren’t selfish people refusing vaccine clogging ER would doubts maybe could gotten care day sooner. ended stay hospital three days. hate we’re living time seriously consider go ER, worth stay retrospect obviously needed help. Maybe rambling haven’t spoken anyone wife I’m confused angry. mother still hasn’t gotten vaccinated. don’t get it. political, using government power control,"" DeSantis said statement Monday. ""These big-government mandates strip away people's rights make best decision themselves.""

""And that's I've issuing big-government mandates."". cognitive dissonance requirement join Cult Party. He’s lying liar lies. vaccinations required immigration long time - standard childhood vaccines, plus relevant boosters. aren’t mandatory US (for school yes, general), work student visa etc.

Maybe it’s hypocritical, it’s new hypocrisy.  People gotten one US getting one. one hospital rural area Upstate. NYC, hospital capacity fine. Magaism must nice. Michigan, masks see grocery stores, even then, that's less half people. ""This political, using government power control,"" DeSantis said statement Monday. ""These big-government mandates strip away people's rights make best decision themselves.""

Fines apply state local agencies.

🧐 want part first 500,000 1 million dosed, discernible side effects, really seemed reason get vaxxed.

The mileage side effects though vary wildly.

I zero reaction first dose, second very, mild reaction slight fever mild sluggishness lasted hours, almost like, ""gee feel weird today?"", oh yea, got vaccine yesterday.

My GF however, first dose, 2 days, one day fever 101 chills like crazy, second dose, fever 104, chills, aches, 2.5 days 4 hours spiking 104.

She hesitant get booster since second dose could come close putting hospital fever spike. Still, people issue.

The time ""research is"" way past. Get vaxxed. want know too. need studies breakthrough infections Sorry seems like i'm addressing speak lying, intention (english one mother languages lack lot vocabulary); intention give opinion also think legit . absolutely reason get vaccine. poses risk pregnant women. go places, risk. impressed doctor's take this. Maybe March made sense, pre Delta pre evidence vaccination pregnancy. doesn't. mother beg get vaccinated. cannot imagine depths despair would lost pregnancy decisions. COVID-19 vaccine makers public health officials suggesting protection provided vaccines wanes time. new study published Sept. 15 preprint server—the study yet peer-reviewed—researchers Moderna, makes one two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (the Pfizer-BioNTech), report people vaccinated within last eight months 36% fewer breakthrough infections vaccinated year ago. 
That suggests vaccine-induced immunity likely highest shortly people get recommended two doses vaccine, starts drop afterward. Moderna vaccine received emergency use authorization (EUA) U.S. Food Drug Administration Dec. 2020; FDA currently reviewing company’s request full approval shot.

Getting people get first vaccine priority 64% protection better still far better 0, already knew high likelihood booster shots would necessary. means year still 60% effective, seems much Pfizer (and taking account prevention severe disease)

Seems case Moderna boosters much less clear vaccines. sorry hear man. stay tough ❤️❤️ Good. Gtfo healthcare don’t actually give shit people.   didn’t say disordered. people did. I’m saying society reacts like general issues. Modern life already lonely atomized. think exacerbating responsible antisocial behavior many people displayed pandemic. fear reason lawmakers bring back pre-existing medical conditions reason deny medical coverage. Also, one New York actually scans Excelsior Pass. they'll check date birth name license time pulling enough get in. location change quarantine though, alternative hotel quarantine - ""they"" *also* know location, also know face, due returned Australia govt issued passport.

It's literally giving information already have.  California still best rate nation despite falling within threshold. Good point. That's never suggested case.  Good. Fuck em   many reasons this. One went strictly age group age group. would say main reason Sweden consensus among medical professionals always morally wrong vaccinate goal lower spread. Earlier pandemic opinion children never got seriously ill. situation vaccination children would made limit spread would impossible Sweden. average population would probably given support, high ranking doctors would rioted written opinion piece opinion piece immorality vaccinating kids personal safety, stop spread only. hase already quite opinion pieces Sweden filled anger predicated fact might vaccination kids limit spread!

Now clear evidence long COVID large portion kids, Swedish health agencies clearly make case vaccination done specifically increase safety individual child.

I think situation similar Norway, decided last week give children one dose (in Sweden two). outside Nordic countries debate seems different, perhaps view vaccination medical profession different elsewhere. seems view healthcare bit individual areas (I could wrong.). let's pretend comparison made.

I agree: isolation, sounds concerning. comparison, makes sense even empathetic weird way. Apparently many people.  Gov embarrassment like accelerated. part exactly? ""bs"" mother's name? doesn’t. poster obvious agenda downvoted Reddit hell. settled federal law specifics. claim one can't obey vaccine mandate due religion RFRA claim, RFRA requires government compelling state interest supersede religious objection. Trying stop another hundred thousand people dying Covid compelling interest, mandate is. police try using facial recognition software sure quarantined people stay home.

The carrot case able return people, quarantine govt run quarantine hotels.

At stage, hopefully late necessary. earlier stage pandemic, would nice alternative let us return people, hotel quarantine spots strictly limited, that's caused huge problems Australians abroad want come home.

No one, seen, advocating contact tracing regular domestic purposes. border crossings, alternative managed quarantine systems.

None answers questions triage antibody tests help ration limited resources. They're still showing hospital require care, COVID non-COVID. non-COVID patient comes matter antibodies not? they're going take bed regardless. COVID patient comes in, presence antibodies help determine level immunity odds survival. Nearly everyone died COVID likely antibodies, bodies produce enough comorbidities.

It's completely pointless endeavor time show late anything mitigate severity infection: they're either going mild case severe case try keep alive.

You know mitigate severity infection? Getting fucking vaccine.  That’s great news. parent imagine tough must parents worried children vaccinated. assume obesity. let's boadly say co-morbilities school O2 sensors ensure room well ventilated well get you, agree. think people also dealing traumas, especially folks reflexively freak act like they’re personally forced something else’s personal choice. Seems like across board could use therapy around here. know therapist making bank. think main question need ask feel absolutely need protected mild infection, 

""Mild"" infection mean 2 weeks worst flu ever had. Plus long term organ damage, even less critical. went ER pain abdomen. pretty sure appendix. waited two hours get temporary room gave ultrasound waited another hour different temp room get covid test. waited another two hours doctor tell appendicitis covid. waited another five hours get checked actual room.

The entire time treated medication help appendicitis finally got room. Throughout entire ordeal appendix could burst caused tremendous complications.

I even get surgery risk covid bad case pneumonia result. Stayed days getting antibiotics breath training avoid getting oxygen. I'm high risk entire time I'm I'm wondering might die there. Luckily ended going home. Critical thinking life skills mandatory courses. last shot? really hope there’s damn variants soon put shit behind us. would suck would get booster next years every months cause stupid virus 😔 Some, maybe even most, definitely all. keep yapping reason. mom died couple weeks ago. abdominal aneurysm otherwise good health. took two days get ICU bed hospital appropriate surgeon. Thanks North Carolina.  would agree, criteria different. also issues side effects other's didn't. none makes big difference picking three. relative risk difference similar.

so rather choose one available, choose one let sleep better night. get shot/shots forget it.  Okay, plan us wear masks rest lives like seatbelts?

Because so, I’m out. That’s stupid plan. went 5 different high schools, one teach statistics took it, know common was, 4 offer it, least schools. 
What really need courses critical thinking. Kind hypocritical considering they’ve never required vaccine.

Who ""they?"" individual?

Or landlords large? colleges require certain vaccines reidence dorms, that's acting landlord sense.

As individual? see ""hypocritical"" see varying levels danger/risk different illnesses choose require vaccine certain illnesses, others. 

I think pretty easy show risk COVID unvaccianted people around FAR higher people MMR. addition, vaccines, MMR places enforcing it. Since landlord already knows local schools getting everyone vaccinated, landlord need check would redundant. problem isn’t fact coronavirus crazy deadly, it’s Americans crazy unhealthy. read around 35%+ Americans considered overweight, CONFIRMED increase complications due Covid. pandemic chalking “trimming fat”, pun intended. yet still ignorant fuckwads protesting mandatory masking crotch fruit spread infected snot bubbles around damned schools. Understood.

So even everyone vaccinated need masks forever?

I wear seatbelt still drive car risk itself. I'm sure risk getting infected ever 0 stuck endless cycle masking?  happened almost! appendix rupture (few days went hospital, pain thought hernia), wait 3-4 hours hospital bed, medical center Houston! vaguely remember that. reason even retained knowledge wear glasses stuck one point. shittier hospitals Mother registered nurse Kaiser Permanente still didn’t want get vaccine? dumb ass. Seeing death around hospital still refusing vaccine despite one first populations eligible receive one front line worker. 

I feel sorry kids grow without parents.   I’m really sick break case right now. got J&amp;J. I’m pretty scared need treatment hospital I’ll treated like crap they’ll assume I’m vaccinated. mean card still. Hopefully I’ll keeping breathing ok home. meant like watch video, pick parts need explanation, send Vincent, gang give explanation. mentioned further, went CVS got it. one really batted eye *except unvaccinated can't vaccine valid reasons, eg putting health risk.

Otherwise yes. Yes, true grifters vaccinated hide it. earth demanding booster shot rather real sick days come PTO? course arguments made latter seems way significant quality life en masse actual root cause describe problem

The workers world unite get booster protect COVID winter. There's plenty going around reddit, too, trust me. Rural residents likely conditions respiratory cardiovascular illness. 

Rural residents tend older urban residents. …what? I’m talking outdoor dining… Wouldn’t make immune compromised? so, qualifies. 
It’s pretty easy get 3rd shot USA. aren’t asking proof.  Interesting. Thanks, I’ll look more. I’m hoping breastfeed 14 months hopefully shouldn’t problem (baby #3). it’s worth looking case. That's bad.  shit ever got 2million hosptial bill i'd prefer take back shoot me. Better permanently debt care vaccination status right (maybe line want travel). want safe go store gym.

Even person able survive getting it, read mess lungs life sure place, wondering anyone boat. got J&amp;J vaccine April. Thursday/Friday got covid (started feeling symptoms Sat/Sun). I’m quarantining 10 days. supposed get test certain # days after? Isn’t possible test positive weeks after? know I’m contagious anymore? Vaccinated people spread get breakthrough infection currently estimated 1 10,000 range.

You're vaccinated. protected, likely get virus, even likely get sick it. Definitely disagree take fully. However knowing going back rural areas imagine definitely lacking overall lot areas. 

But yes wanting learn jack def part well. 

But let tell rural towns def taught creationism improper history First consider nobody vaccinated, much total hospitalisation be?

Then consider whole population vaccinated, percentage remaining hospitalised cases would vaccinated? work restaurant/bar major anxiety going work every time go. I'm fully vaccinated. wear mask. I've got 13 bar facing seats full people wearing masks distance between, maybe (being generous here) 3 feet distance personally. 
I'm quitting 6 yrs. customers give 2 shits anyone sit near. someone wears mask unless physically taking drink bite. damn rare. 
I eat indoors establishments anymore.  killing elders cool, consider Myles Davis! suddenly scramble trying convince everyone get boosters spending time convincing everyone they're useless...

That seems par COVID course. people defend nonsense say ""they followed science."" 

In case science clear : vaccine immunity wanes COVID worse before. combination disaster waiting happen.  Well, papers referenced least good ballpark data available. would incredibly surprised find data supports ~80% patients put ventilator die state.   reached million excess deaths September 5th. Reported deaths Sept 5th 645,572. 2021 data undercounting may worse 2020 Much respect that’s overzealous. vaccinated wear n95 mask, additional protection superfluous. Well truth told little distressing metric shit-ton people come try pressure eating indoors simply desire anymore... kind weird since I'm advocating EVERYONE take stance, right? me. Making choices here. again, maybe I'm creating mirror yall look choices? also, I'm diagnosing people internet, there's that. boosters approved, people 2 shots considered fully vaccinated? COVID-19 vaccination patrons workers indoor bars, wineries, breweries nightclubs next month. new initiative nation’s populous county begins Oct. 7, proof least one vaccine dose required. Nov. 4, proof full vaccination mandatory  combination exaggeration outright lies.

And ""someone heard about"" died could lie read Facebook.

The stats serious vaccine side effects maintained updated doctors, hospitals, etc. tracked carefully. Facebook cess pool lies. Absolutely unacceptable. makes angry.  Sorry, added context. said, work US. agree places like NZ done fantastic job. really matter blatantly illegal. OJ, would basically contract dispute. i'm going lie, really confusing smart enough understand information there. could wrong, read reason data shows J&amp;J less effective criteria testing strict compared two, person takes two doses J&amp;J, would effective Pfizer.

I know. super confused do. read even person survives getting COVID-19, messes person's lungs badly messed life, want get vaccine protect that. read vaccinated prevent person getting COVID-19.  Okay. Seriously, nobody’s forcing anything. also chill pathological opposition assumption anyone gives shit lol much poster might need see someone lol last 2 years? Using math, 1 250 US residents died heart disease Lol video explains J&amp;J vaccine compares extremely high-transmission areas people refusing take precautions Delta rips population. would go Walmart absolutely to, would put side-shields glasses. Would applicable lease renewals adds then. can't evict people without subjecting lawsuits. second part key think. kind mobility key. always pandemics always situations impact hospitals. whether hurricanes, tornadoes, man made disasters, accidents, etc. surely highly paid government nerds calculate average many hospitals go service various times year, long takes get running, long would take mobilize alternate facilities, etc calculation much space/materials/manpower would needed cover much need plus xx% breakthrough fine long minor. I'm sure I'm agreeance there.

The people FDA welcome get breakthrough COVID donate boosters, protect family millions people country get vaccinated wear mask. Thanks sharing info. Absolutely necessity getting vaccine. lengths COVID goes bypass immune system hide it’s late insane, way prevent get vaccine. 

It’s cool see new preventatives/treatments applications outside COVID gaining steam. I’m interested trying next time I’m sick it’ll help prevent spread. Ok never said one else eat indoors. whatever want, yo. choosing eat indoors. it. No, cannot. 

PCR tests determine immunity. 

That’s CDC explicitly says **not** use purpose. Trump got booed telling followers take vaccine. many layers ridiculousness there. doctors county say Florida DOH reporting lot deaths. Every day 1000-3000 Americans die COVID

Anti-maskers anti-vaxxers worse terrorists don’t expect see retrospective cohort study delta patients next year.   Nurses get different job, nurses can't get vaccine 4) stated going treat like flu stay home sick, ignoring spread week showing symptoms
5) Covid cases ICU long time getting better dying meaning beds tied 2-4 weeks meaning, cases day, compounds number beds needed plus massive ramp cases. 
6) Hospitals Canada private, money making businesses.  Hospital capacity 70-80% normal times limited ICU beds open. 
7) province trying REDUCE nurses wages pandemic going save people nurses leaving rather dealing covididiots stress overtime. ICU nurses Canada require close year training/education ontop RN (i may wrong RN)  designed run capacity funded at. That's hard concept one absolute staples publicly funded healthcare systems.

That's capacity means extremely easy check self. Notice reported ICU capacity goes peak covid cases? ICU capacity number reported directly Alberta health services. problem define capacity take them. going go definition random person internet. Heart disease number one cause death America. Someone dies every 36 seconds. extremely taxing medical system taxpayer. Smoking Obesity contribute exponentially.

Not that, obese people way likely end ""taking up"" hospital beds, due Covid, diseases well.

Exposure secondhand smoke causes estimated 41,000 deaths year among adults United States. Yes think people completely freaking without really understanding anything.

At kids school kid symptoms (cold etc), need negative covid test doctor's note come back school. doctor going do? Give covid test.

Meanwhile people completely lost sight fact kids infinitesimal risk. likely going get exposed virus school, get sick, immune, that's end it, long parents family vaccinated.   percent recent deaths almost completely avoidable ? must least 95 percent.

There's chance getting very, sick dying young it. poor kids looking mommy. US plan traveling internationally, maybe Moderna. outside US plan travel internationally, maybe Pfizer. 

There's huge difference Moderna Pfizer except dose higher Moderna shots, appears increase amount antibodies *possibly* makes bit effective breakthrough infections. one may better traveling internationally, believe Pfizer widely accepted distributed outside US Moderna, though gap seem big anymore. “Two scientists lead F.D.A.’s vaccine branch said would leave agency fall, part unhappiness administration’s push booster doses federal researchers could review evidence.”

That’s always good thing, alienating/ostracizing scientists middle pandemic. Hopefully get replaced yes men don’t push back hard things like “science,” “data,” not. someone going recently Covid numbers inflated. ""fam med field"".

So first ""inflating numbers"" make Trump look bad, now, group people ""inflating numbers"" make Biden look bad?

I hate fucking stupid alarming amount people are. Take outdoor dining awesome. Still much cuz cook don't. yes.

If third shot safe improves protection, authorize ASAP.

They always donate doses countries. protect tens millions unused doses US. Capitalism pandemics nothing other. countries around world capitalistic societies still open public. Stop weird making pandemic political already is, jfc... would cool get therapy lot reasons, sure. question whether need indoor dining would ""somewhat"" liking

No, opinion ""somewhat"" still downplaying risk. don’t trust vaccine decided get plastic surgery That’s I’m saying now… say “no new unvaxed covid 19 patients backlog currently treatment unvaxed patients reduces 25% hospital capacity. accept new unvaxed c19 patients 25% capacity” That's thing. could build infrastructure track previous infections like vaccination. would spending lot money goodwill give people *less* protection vaccinated them. Oh ok sorry. cases, I'll go cook home? big deal eat out. often covid, I'm missing much. get impression lot people eat LOOOOT family.  pandemic, rural death rate equal slightly higher metropolitan death rate. (See graph above.) parallel tracks began diverge early August. Since then, weekly death rate rural areas grown six-fold. period, metropolitan weekly death rate increased week, rural death rate 4.8 per 100,000 population, 109% higher metropolitan rate 2.3 per 100,000.

See difference large enough cause anyone looking numbers wake pay attention. case detect sarcasm original post, agree masks effective, also think boosters needed already people immunocompromised.

The mask part comment reference CDC flip flopping masks effective:

[CDC recommend masks prevent says wearing mask helps prevents transmission sure see one might say spinning wheel come whether work not. think something like 30+% current cases school aged children. Yeah here. see decide Friday, need figure get it. doubt complex, still better prepared. sure exactly safety data referring to.

Homeopathy vastly different territory pretty much always amounts sugar tablets tap water, frankly bullshit. posted I'm knowledgeable Vaccine, want know accurate points are. Good hear much better. :)

That's great example doctor saying normal patient needing bed days. exactly same, no. impact still kicking someone home unacceptable. 

Why governmentally mandate vaccine rather making people suffer getting vaccine? mean make sense? less cruel?  I'm sick ""experts"" pushing non-scientific opinions public instead jobs providing unbiased facts; they're almost bad anti-vaxxers.

There's real ""debate"" facts here. Boosters help prevent severe disease elderly, may yet needed prevent severe disease younger adults, still help reduce symptomatic illness risk transmission vulnerable persons. There's also dispute boosters carry risks young people risks extremely minuscule.

Personally, care reducing risk symptomatic disease transmitting COVID-19 others even supposed experts like Dr. Chin-Hong ""don't care."" that's I'm going responsible thing keep getting regular boosters whether recommend not. Hope end kids, upset many 1, 2, 3, 4 shot series childhood immunizations. I'm sure first developed immediately knew many never change new data changes viruses. I'm sure kid mind got shots, get back normalcy. ultrasound time stent placement permanent damage, currently cardiac rehab believe follow-up ultrasound soon. (My mom’s nurse, she’s one keeping track thankfully.)

He issues second hospital due delay treatment. blood pressure kept going condition destabilized, transferred third hospital. understand, addition delaying cardiac cath second hospital also place nitro drip, probably caused issues. third hospital stabilized stent placed. 

Obviously don’t know much lasting damage done, care definitely suffered backlog patients.  even supplies like oxygen drugs needed vent patients short supply hard-hit states.

And ripple effects outside hospitals. industries need oxygen, get places hospitals do. 

And worried fabrication shop getting oxygen, well, water treatment plants use oxygen treat water. Seriously. tf cares Nikki Fucking Minaj say issue? Antibodies actually WOULD indicate odds survival definition, antibodies exactly that! answer question? minimum average concentration antibodies would produce immune response provides protection. concentration, might ask? involves epidemiological studies, statistics research. However antibody tests would allow determine patients would treated covid ward, would non-covid ward. Pretty sure masks effective, since used hospitals many, many decades.

Ever see surgeon wearing mask performing operation? Yeah - trying minimize germs stuff. rural death rate slightly higher urban rate much pandemic. something changed August. 

Yeah, dumbasses stayed unvaccinated. Totally fault. It’s probably best close ~~daycares~~ schools now. father 6 months later still relieved die ""covid"". He's mostly relieved counted amongst deaths. 

Why though? don’t understand relief won’t counted amongst Covid deaths. still excuse hold doses population. matter USA ""RoW"" (rest world), new complete cycle always better two booster shots, one first dose compared booster. 

It's boosters bad, really suboptimal wide administering finishing eligible population USA rest world. Good observation. I’ll using future. families get vaccinated too👍🏻 protection severe disease wane age? Seems drop older people, young people?

It wanes faster older are.

The data Israel shows clearly.

Severe cases among 60+ age group two doses much higher compared received booster shot.

For Young people difference smaller. nature - universe everything - created God, believe? Dude, vaccine incredibly safe. Even turns ivermectin a.beneficial effect, vaccines also way better ivermectin fighting covid. Show study, even one shows correlation vaccine comes worse terms either safety efficacy. die, die, die. OK maybe get live give weird eye die too. Yeah sounds like huge dick, death innocent children etc.  Thank you! can’t tell many times I’ve googled combination “autoimmune patient, suppressed “and found little information that’s helpful. doctors including specialists say get soon can, won’t break CDC’s advice, least right now. living lower vaccinated area, plus small children, even though homeschool currently, still makes nervous. get Pfizer.

(Pfizer 1 2.) head hurts reading Yeah logic vaccinated people getting back normal bigger problem people getting vaccinated Random question, kept hearing “well Moderna higher dose Pfizer reasons it’s apples apples Pfizer gets bang buck,” BS? don’t need spreading covid putting patients unnecessary risk though. won’t get vaccinated, shouldn’t job, even shortage. Shortage excuse willingly decreasing patient safety quality care. Yeah, getting worse. considered move Nez Perce county years ago, decided Latah instead. Honestly, bummed time hindsight, I'm happy choice. Maybe #1 population, sure top list Covid/mask/vax deniers percentage.

Takes guys working health care system. don’t want treated someone rejects fundamental public health measures violates gut feeling, immune data. unscientific gets. need find different line work, like art something like that. freedom unemployed 😌 Yep. Government could’ve should’ve made masks, lockdowns, vaccines mandatory. BS medical/religious exemptions, get vaccine. Apparently we’re good job.  Amen, were.  It’s dumb perspective difference bad press event ends becoming covid spreader versus people spreading time. don’t want liable host event caused outbreak. feel parents. kids expendable worker work since day one pandemic zero idea going best PPE handkerchief mask definitely feel them. Boosters significantly help. put numbers almost back start.  Religious exemptions COVID vaccine undergo scrutiny conscientious objector status draft. 

If deeply held beliefs, prove it. Show us belong church longstanding objection vaccines, member church long time, supply references others church church’s leader. really wrong Christian Scientist, church may recently stepped back that, historically lead proponent medical religious exemption laws. responsible pretty horrific preventable deaths children past. people pre-existing mental illness + sim racing immunocompromised people legitimate reactions vaccines CAN'T get vaccine. Right now, children 12 can't get it. Singapore well.

It's overwhelmingly clear FDA misleading people science they're ethically opposed boosters, principle, even held rest world much, boosters US represent mere 2-3 weeks Pfizer Moderna's production, production even limiting factor much remaining unvaccinated areas. Oh good, hometown news...    Well, they're right, least close enough. first. could considered valid argument year ago, new. billion doses administered around world significant issues, new anymore, first one really meaningful anymore. That's what's hard reading statistics never know actual denominator everyone covid gets tested. know town official numbers embarrassingly wrong. I’m disputing it. I’m saying think it’s absolute number, ie, denominator entire population US children. AAP number uses positive test results denominator. as? breakthrough infection rate low (0.2%) get breakthrough infections, rate long COVID symptoms half compared unvaccinated people. things know we've time study virus symptoms, like long symptoms last problems road. Negativity always bad. something wrong feeling negative war criminals sex slavery? anything wrong, feeling negative abhorent.  correct, politicians vaccinated. assume ones state not, fact vaccinated (just telling base) Whatever numbers are, need accurate, that's point. 

Did even look link shared? 

It actually contains real data, graphs comparing covid non-covid related deaths compared baseline average prior years. 

It's important keep detailed records track cases deaths accurately, agree? 

My point scientists looking statistics finding inconsistencies add up. disagree, masking social distancing kept SF's numbers fully check even height outbreak, prior vaccines available. remarkable extremely dense, landlocked county almost million people 600 COVID deaths total. personal freedom ends public health begins.

This. wish people grasp concept better. adds truth, statement vaccinated people don’t spread exactly like saying people wearing seatbelts don’t die. False assumption.

Where someone thread say vaccinated people don’t spread COVID? mean imply anything beyond fact 50 closer 30 100 consider 50:30 ""pretty close"" 1:1 ratio. Literally 400 days absolutely domestic restrictions world yo-yo lockdowns. One lockdown issue. Christian scientists (historically, least) believed sickness choice, founder even wrote learning illness causes illness, discouraged even educating themselves. modern form church might back-pedaled bit, lobbying Christian Scientists huge part religious exemption laws got introduced 60s 70s.  point long since started vaccinations really need update shot dominant variant (delta right now) start annual shots like flu. zero problem this, way - vaccines effective, cheap, safe.

Every work somehow contributes society, results objects services provided. meant nobody able live life without working buying things made people. work point able buy houses, that's ok. people inheriting dozens houses imo. Oh Im sorry. trying reply u/trashwizard3000. sure happened there. many, *most* hospitals. Mostly states low vaccination rates, low income, low education. sure study answers questions though good someone saying thought Duke University overreacting? agree sucks, eastern WA similar North Idaho Central Idaho respectively (philosophically, educationally, politically). example, live Latah County (sadly) among best vaccinated Idaho 51% receiving least one dose. Neighboring Whitman County Washington 48%. Kootenai/Spokane north better WA (at 40/60ish) that's still pretty crappy. Source: know borders us vs. helping. know I'm preaching choir say getting vaccinated best minimize exposure (masks, distancing, staying F home) way, blaming stupid people. Stupid going stupid. Unfortunately, us care enough get vaccinated suffering. best piece advice: loved one elderly, make sure taken care of. strategy keep needing care, 100% suffer crisis care standards.

This feels like dystopian novel... seems align data seen elsewhere.   want get priest beer  Letting live house, house. it, like rent anything. renting is. That's alot words say right. accept apology.  turns darwin super persistent. unfortunately he's always accurate. idiots world getting everyone else killed. know what, right. missed decimal place. That's me. Sorry. get respect can't imagine teacher wearing day every day years. completely opposed state's governor's efforts stop us requiring masks school imagining forever work seems depressing. like public transit something that's big deal. Wtf isn’t appendicitis considered urgent even ER standards? utterly insane. estimates long covid suggest around 11 million US.

Although weeks old account millions Americans covid time. conclusions based limited data made. powers decided want everyone get vaccinated. everything make happen.

Do think government would completely transparent vaccine risks reduced uptake 5 10 percent? course not. Start turning away unvax. Let die alone afraid. honestly give shit anymore. want vaccine, go hospital sick.  “May needed improve immunity”. 

So **very much WANTED**    Yeah pretty clear personal choice keep masking. I'm going free country. would nice wearing mask controversial wearing white shirt green shirt. mask personal choice, goddamn right wear it. 

People ready jump soapbox preach you. friend Moderna trial got 3rd shot 8/4/2021 antibody level early September got COVID + 8 year old daughter got fully vaccinated step father.She symptomatic GI symptoms cough immune compromised.I wonder antibody doesn’t protects us protect?Because delta attacks body fast cells can’t catch it.  Refusing vaccine isn’t “not believing science”.

A lot don’t want vaccine reasons:

Hippy dippy shit
Already immune infection
Uncertainty long term risks
Very low risk demographic

You believe vaccines work still want one. example, haven’t gotten shingles vaccine yet. Pretty sure works great. Don’t think need it. didn’t get it.

Assuming anyone isn’t yet vaccinated must believe vaccines useless pretty ignorant take.  I’m gonna assume you’ve never hung 2-year-old. idea toddlers wearing masks way efficacy misguided. Since thr us large profit system ha ing excess capacity norm everyone get whatever need almost instantly proper insurance pay pocket.  rest left poor health financial ruin perpetuates crime issues poverty vs high income promotes. 


I really don’t understand us soo publicly funded even run Health care everyone full access medical treatment.  Instead paying $$$ insurance companies making large profits everyone could putting similar % income tax instead never worry pocket costs medical treatment. 

I could work us make money I’m sure two kids medical cost would massive probally level playing fields trying navigate school system ensure kids get good education paying 40-60000 attend university instead pay 4-6 per year it’s subsidized.  healthy snd educated population best interest lifts everyone up. 

My outlook anyhow. Agree people calculation, nah germaphobe decision.  laws randomly told us recently COVID last year wasn’t bad bad cases made up. Guess isn’t vaccinated. Guess cut out.  get filled ? keep bringing ships continuing help people ?

 Bottom line needs get vaccinated !! understand people.  went grocery store things. Got line, leaving space.  60-65 year old guy got right behind started asking line. (No mask) people store masks right thing. Unless undocumented immigrants, data there.

Everyone national ID number that's linked age vaccination status. mouth-breathing anti-vaxxers get hospital beds. Instead get cot tent parking lot. 

Screw - they're going believe science go end line care.  Worldometers WA 45th lowest death rate per million, King county around 30th vaccinated county country (out 3300).  area actually ~84% 12+ years olds fully vaccinated, demographic 80% 20-29 group.  
Mortality Rate per Age Level Vaccine Data:  Religious exemption stop jeopardizing public health. Absolutely fucking ridiculous !! Get vaccine stop trying kill rest population !! 

There already shortage drs nurses . 

Now want spend day around people don’t care life. Fuck !! like things told kid do. people never evolved past 4 year old. Delta hitting hard predictable.

It’s like getting mad meteorologists hurricane jogs 100 miles “course”. I’m like comes covid germs. Like seriously reading comments sounded super close writing them. I’m saying let know actually really problem really need seek treatment it. take extreme. know it’s rational logical us, risk assessment issue rn bc we’re traumatized covid. careful times didn’t really constitute crossing line mental illness does. stated therapy increased depression since covid I’ll talking too. hope seek therapy too, bc life actually need way us. realized recently. Risk Assessment. fucked up. government paying people's negative tests get pass. April 2020 articles keep getting published present? would staff them? That’s big part problem- it’s always lack physical space. need staff beds. man. One month ago gallbladder attack pain going away. Headed ER waited hour see someone, sweating ass off. several hours finally get taken back get morphine. Doctors said gallbladder hella sick pus. one point contemplating blood transfusion things got really bad (it didnt). can't imagine situation going dying cuz jackass want get shot. I'd pissed ass ghost. Ass ghost. Join one also find ways make effective donations next opponent. work private practice. giving pfizer booster doses employees got moderna would like stick can’t get moderna monday pharmacy I’m probably gonna mix vaccines get pfizer third one Noting pro-vaccination, largely agreed proposed mass-vaccination initiatives (call swine, I've getting inoculated since baby sure preventable diseases time writing, suddenly Autism spectrum)...

But feelings different knowing operates *buildings* multiple tenants, service workers, common areas. It'd one thing single 2-bedroom house middle town. building like makes sense he's getting involved. Yeah, would think probably z-axis might useful would compare states percentage densely populated areas. must metric already exists somewhere. 660,000 !! don’t want get vaccinated, don’t get help hospital bills. people need held accountable screwing everyone else makes feel better, FDA actually care catch COVID fully vaccinated. They're really interested whether get really sick (probably enough hospitalized) whether large enough percentage vaccinated people occur. happens, consider boosters appropriate time. terms land mass- New York #27 New Jersey #46.

In terms density, New Jersey #2 New York #12. 

New York City biggest densest city US, huge swathes New York State rural. 

New Jersey rural urban areas, state skews heavily suburban. Tons houses small lots, tons people commuting NYC Philly.

Those geographic factors NJ (slightly) higher death rate NY State. Yeah mean I’m wearing mask now. people access vaccine don’t take it, don’t really give shit happens them. I’m wearing one longer hypothetical grandparents.  not? makes classmates safer reduces outbreaks close classrooms worse. I’d say that’s something thankful for. It’s piece protective clothing shouldn’t politicized.
   

It sucks cases aren’t low enough go without, since aren’t, it’s great kids adjust protect others. fair, percentage religious people dropping worldwide, painfully slow :) Last time, Antibodies actually WOULD indicate odds survival definition

Antibodies alone determine effective immunity determining effective immunity [requires simply counting test results show antibodies, indicates likely infected COVID-19 time past. **may** also mean immunity. **there's lack evidence whether antibodies means protected** reinfection COVID-19. **The level immunity long immunity lasts yet known**. Ongoing studies eventually reveal data this.

Vaccines safe effective help prevent hospitalization death, fwiw. even someone’s recovered prior infection, still gotten vaccine — that’s best advice follow it’s CDC FDA recommend. That’s insane. That’s pretty much we’ve averaging Maryland past 2-3 weeks, despite 8x population. Hey, Ive got empty Super KMart city.

120,000 square feet awful lot space put beds temp walls facility.  want I’m worried employee health nurse yelling me. Lol 

But organization can’t hold accountable unless there’s policy place not. office 100% vaccinated? UK children secondary school age 11+ required wear masks school. school year restrictions dropped. Yes. raised capacity anticipation lot people requiring ventilators.  additional icu beds aren’t normally required general healthcare always free beds available. 

Outside profit healthcare, don’t think many countries double icu capacity need. 

In us hospitals owned run different identities , atleast that’s understanding vs Canada hospitals owned /run government icu capacity spread/adjusted across hospitals province Us it’s not. 


So example province 1.4 million ~74 icu beds one nurse assigned bed normal care additional icu beds surgery care etc. Icus run say 80%-95% Capacity fluctuates based people coming in, recovering moving icu dying.  It’s typical Icu care last weeks. Anyhow increased icu capacity 140 available beds, doubling amount icu capacity required means taking highly trained nurses surgery recovery meaning surgeries get cancelled.   could triple icu beds theoretically room, nobody else highly trained icu nurses staff beds one one basis shifted 1 nurse per 2-3 patients lowers quality care.  can’t scale icu nurses it’s takes 6months year ontop registered nurse 2-4 year post secondary school degree. requirements nursing Canada higher us based thr issue see us nurses moved Canada require additional schooling certified instances. 

High daily cases Covid means higher icu admissions 2-5% Covid patients require icu care support consider icu patients tend stay icu weeks months recovering dying means people aren’t cycled icu fast people coming in. 

So normal no-covid times icu bed capacity issue spun based needs expense surgeries etc.  capacity prolonged pandemic comes around every 100 years isn’t something pay capacity standby. like activities lol

Others go socialize please. I'm stopping shaming anyone. wanna participate. Opening schools back without vaccinating children stupidest thing we've ever done nation, dead dying kids price pushing back normalcy, ay?? need close schools children vaccinated, states enforce mask mandates, Avg redditor Can't sue they're never admitted treatment. 

We enacted laws protecting private businesses Covid liability. Let's get asses gear demand hospitals. Commission taken much active approach ensure Biontech partnered European company. wife severe adverse reaction COVID vaccine doctors deemed medically ineligible booster. medical exemptions going bullshit. used tell people never take ER work in. want colleagues seeing like that. every ER city overflowing I've changed tune least get brought ER there's chance get somewhat timely treatment. Every ER day longer wait unless knocking deaths door.  That's generic questionnaire they'll make fill vaccination. got something similar going pharmacy vaccination.
Don't worry it. questions even relevant (e.g. covid vaccines contain eggs). Ask person administering vaccine concerns. 

You'll fine. Takeout best worlds me. cook sit watch movie something. I'm glad dont free health care, could imagine much longer would take then?!

/s   Barbados incredible problem street crime muggings especially foreign visitors calm would worry effect could language, social development, understanding facial expressions etc. Yes vaccine go right front line. Good, everything else. ""Hey want inject neurotoxin causes botulism face."" Anti-vaxxer hesitate all.

Is surprise though? They're known self-centred, course they'd willing take whatever takes maintain appearance. Happened friend. 20 hrs w football shape protruding abdomen ER bc burst appendix.  also said research. Yes believe ho married murderer real doctor. nah, I'm vaxxed worn mask since memorial day except airports doctors office. people done stopped caring awhile ago ""Thinning herd"" Delta variant unvaccinated rural counties.

That's already they're it. someone bed, can't boot higher priority person comes. yesterday someone came covid bed available, got it, nobody higher priority. higher priority person arrives today get take spot. already theirs. think easy given distrustful medical authorities already. Like, 'we trust prevent this, trust fix we're death's door."" mystifies me. Oh god sucks Entirely fault. Someone told me, healthcare worker, flatten curve nothing hospitals, masks, need better research.

And I'm talking way number counted.

Dishonorable discharge, regular discharge? happened refused those?  almost pisses see someone wearing mask incorrectly mask all. like...how hell realize wearing nose incredibly damn stupid?

Because opposition actually approval status. Approval status happens nice sounding cover actual reasons. Oof. That's Freedom™   COVID, of. Thank providing information.  Healthcare worker here, confirm big balls walk covid ICU surge. would weaken? Universal masking makes deaf life near impossible. lipread exclusively. everyone wears masks rest life may well give up, I'm going cut off, treated like shit isolated. mask disables hearing loss.

I lipread communication. communication. accept scribbled notes circumstances. Speech text useless background noise. Hearing aids boost lipreading comprehension, replace it. Gestures offensive unclear.

Deaf people considered people insist masks. We're seen collateral damage, needs matter. wrong definition ableism. sacrificed one compromising. Trump Tower.

He's got shit ton space those. Back April, talking mom (who's got immune issues eagerly got vaccinated), excited COVID done. said likely going linger due anti-vax. told her, ""You going see hundreds maybe thousands deaths day December, understand still happening.""

I wrong. happened end summer.  sorry deal that. reality, protecting him. break Coronavirus deaths age brackets, 1 35 people age 85 died result Covid last 18 months. Imagine? 1 35. Covid certainly spared age bracket, elderly dying astounding rate. Often, alone hospitals, unable see loved ones. So, definitely favor refusing take mask give exposure, though punishes like toddler forced take medicine. Fast food restaurants really go back drive car delivery light upticks cases deaths right now. $15 dollar minimum wage. give sick days, vacation, heathcare. That’s Biden got ahead mandate , projections. applauding move btw, get hate messages. Roll tide! /s masks, comorbidities, age lifestyle prides contrarian experts science reckless level.

In case anyone wondering comparison. Even landlords based occasionally. Link? bit worried, especially holiday season I'm hoping since good majority people vaccinated many people still wearing masks careful, surge insane uncontrollable. We've holding steady last month despite delta things pretty much back normal socially speaking fingers crossed. I'm sure accounts speaking broadly. dudes athletic. thought got dropped small fish ocean. means people I'm thinking falling even close good enough scholarship catagory. brain damage? Neural denegeration, like seen Spanish Flu.

Gonna whole generation people doddery time. Wear good mask store fine. people one dose eventually get 2.  future, may improved vaccines treatments, value ""delaying inevitable."" Hmmm?

No-one EVER dies merely recovered cancer; reason mentioned context predict people dying COVID-19. NYC mask rule 2 years months. Wonder it’s news now? rely solely lipreading communication. idea everyone always wearing mask means isolated society. 

Written notes offensive shit. replacement lipreading. also put burden provide accessibility hearing people, ableist. disables me. deafness disability. Hearing culture is. good argument had. Christian, even disturbing watch certain groups Christians use religion facade mask pure ignorance pandemic general. Please keep calling bs. However, representative Christians, aware many taking pandemic quite seriously. Delta much contagious last year. Oh maybe people promote defend ""therapies,"" ""MAY play detrimental role"" causing people hesitate getting vaccine, infuriating. civil discussion Internet??? Bullshit this? Where's drama fighting!!
Have culture? early year. surgeon thinks appendix already burst home. abdominal pain two days coincided period thought bad. couldn’t walk pain husband said we’re going. Last time ER, treated like hypochondriac really didn’t want go especially around time vaccines available age group.

Went closest ER avoid COVID crowd. think would moved almost rolling floor pain. First thing appendix test hurt like hell. ordered imaging (I didn’t see it) husband thought already knew appendix burst (he EMT background asked questions led believe that). hospital emergency surgery facility barely closed got imaging negative COVID test results back. transfer main hospital (the one avoided going to) get surgery. 

Once hospital, didn’t know put yet. also someone operating room. said wait couple hours. forgot say husband wasn’t anymore since he’s caring son home. couple hours changed 4 hours. already 3am haven’t eaten drank anything. Finally, told person bad shape 12 hours. surgery morning antibiotics stuck hospital longer. super dehydrated get electrolytes. potassium IV super painful. Also, getting people back work capitalism. Also factor less health care readily nearby.

My (vaccinated) dad (non-COVID) emergency lives bum-fuck nowhere. Waited week ER awaiting bed, due COVID patients taking (very few) beds. beds 250 miles. 

YES WEEK. That's typo.

Miraculously catch COVID ya know vaccinated. son recently (less month) treated appendicitis. almost go different children’s hospital bc doc urgent care told might diversion (it not). waited till next morning surgery bc OR’s booked solid. spent night children’s cancer ward bc beds full. Luckily ok (very low chance bursting symptoms start &lt;24 hours). honestly waited several hours even going bc sure serious worried COVID exposure.  upper-midwest next... MN specifically, middle high schools require masks. major jump cases last week, huge jump last 3 days (daily average 2,700, 2,000/day last week, 1,600/day week before).

A lot schools ""we refuse shut circumstances"" mindset, well. going get LOT worse gets better. Finally! can’t take chest pains strokes back right away anymore. intubated patients traumas beds. Broken bones bad lacerations altered mental status psych patients others. ridiculously dangerous hospitals right now. Every single teacher faculty member best protect students, putting harms way educate restore sense normalcy deserves respect support. financial whatever means needed. can’t imagine job circumstances like hard must be. 

Teachers never get praise deserve. good ones heroes. read this, thank everything do.  Ive there... 😓

When wee lad, sat emergency room, sliced open hand bleeding kitchen towel. hour.

Until folks finally came w insurance card.

Just imagine ur place queue hospital filled Covidiots. 😳😥 I’m saying create additional beds. I’m saying reserve beds have. aren’t going beds everyone, consistently non-Covid patients aren’t getting care? Divert resources going Covid - places seemingly 100% - non-Covid matters. Oh yes, could it. would also explain US high numbers compared similarly Vaxxed counties.

In NZ cases mostly come churches. get 10 schools, including biggest uni church spread most. take denying elephant room away redditors! wish could throw unvaccinated covid patients need space. also created oxycodone heroin opioid crises.

Your idea basically deaf people matter. Okay sorry took bit. real quick, searching several journals search engines wasn’t able find anything specific way Delta vs. Alpha vs. Wild type variant mortality rates mechanical intubation. I’m sure data floating around there, I’m honestly sure pulled healthcare systems analyzed yet (at least place publicly available aware of). Peer-reviewed articles take time write due process forming hypothesis, creating study methods, collecting analyzing data, peer-review process (from heard) massive headache. likely studies coming next couple years able give us answers question, moment I’m aware exist. **If anyone else comments references recent studies question please feel free link them!**

 
That said, let’s talk things context reading looking articles, starting consider bit like comparing apples oranges moment data available. 
 
**Overall Covid-19 numbers US 09/14/2021** US confirmed cases 41, 478, 328; deaths 665, 870 cases 42,379,837; deaths 684, 063 cases 41, 066, 110; deaths 657, 114

[PRoVENT-COVID published online 10/23/2020. evaluated ventilation management patients Covid 19 national, retrospective observational study done 18 ICUs Netherlands evaluated patients Mar 1 Apr 1, 2020. basically looked bunch clinical variables (ventilator settings, patient vital signs, proning therapy various treatments, etc.) subsequent patient outcomes. Intensivists used study make new treatment recommendations including proning therapy parameters weren’t using early pandemic. 
 
For study sourced looked data weeks included. looked numbers year later (when Delta first hit) compared. thing stood death rates similar even though total confirmed cases much higher 2021. So, credit comment above, yes learned able treat effectively; however, also coming tail end holiday season 2021 likely see spike confirmed cases deaths. thing Delta doesn’t necessarily hit body systems harder, communicable you’re going see higher case rate statistically hospitals running trouble. Additionally death rates high March April 2020 beginning pandemic hitting US didn’t know treat things like proning therapy IV steroids (there actually preprint articles earlier based previous, best data hand time, said shouldn’t use steroids covid…oops). far comparison mechanical ventilation strain worse (wild type delta), can’t really teased apart factors (at least me).

Malaria still kills lot people around Kisumu, guess someone could mistake Covid death malaria region. again, malaria deaths amongst children generally safest Covid.   really are. end day, need look two Covid patients going die without ventilator, choose one use ventilator on, one left.

The 80 year old dependents unemployed chosen 20-50 year olds children employment. presented situation left go on. 

Would ethically sound use ventilator one vaccinated instead unvaccinated, bed patient non-covid related issues Covid patient vaccinated. Dying Covid like 90% choice western world now. Or, know, one die it. Try going outside getting little exercise. Maybe change way think job. bad think. Lots people like you. OK. Well kid wasn’t vaccinated yet old enough been, would’ve fucked hard.  I'm planning get one *me* blood draws. android too.

Answer 2 describes the, *it depends* answer. Eventually argue, you'l end semantics battle. amount money US saving Afghanistan could vaccinate whole damned world year.   kid also wasn’t vaccinated, yes, could be. get pass selfishness happened unrelated issue? Let’s go shame shame. Keep consistent.  there's bug going around.

Ok, well, want long covid want infect family. So. Landlords provide housing people money, they're providing shelter good. telling every landlord country money grubbing, soulless drain? Get hold reality man, judging entire group people based what? limited personal experience? political views? 

This man tenants loved ones die, see might affect someones decision making? 

Your idea forcing people get vaccinated utterly fanciful. legal country unilaterally force people take vaccine without becoming completely authoritarian. going send military go door door innoculate people? 

And despite year research, testing, study positive messaging still tens thousands people refuse vaccination. what's plan? Make illegal unvaccinated? Throw unvaccinated prison? hope dad well!

Similar thing earlier year. Dad couldn’t breathe, went hospital. three days, never room. mom sent pictures room: needle floor, blood sheets. horrible treated poorly. Bonus: week dad got home regular doctor called say minor heart attack one knew. worry, bureaucrats convene discuss discussing approving them... week.   Thank deciding get vaccinated Yep. reasons bad faith. 

They like throwing tantrums. Also, antibody count goes later, recovered infection- still memory B cells parts immune system protect you. antibodies present mean protected. one guy said r/serbia, ""lack trust goverment + ignorance = fertile soil anti-vaxerism Also, ""natural immunity"" ""muh immune system"" Kiwi here, totally leave house even lvl4 lockdown Auckland experiencing. can’t much aside essential runs supermarket food, exercise, getting medical attention/treatment etc

Like let’s say 40% patients unvaccinated. hospital full there’s multiple patients, 10% hospital capacity, need use hospital urgently. dot prioritise unvaccinated patients get kicked first? Depends live people care still living there. Maybe conservative?  sure won’t true every state Yeah - risk. virus consistently spread rapidly enough, lack pressure become less dangerous.

.* Mild disease include staying bedridden two weeks high fever coughing guts out. sound like know myocarditis feels like. You’ve before? Maybe ask doctor think? think there’s mask mandates lockdowns, vaccination personal choice. state lockdowns requirements masks, cases way up, businesses definitely require employees vaccinated

I think it’s insane states banning businesses requiring people vaccinated also banning mask mandates. CNBC explain well. Here's better description two-month period July-August, researchers identified 88 COVID-19 cases among got two shots recently, compared 162 cases among vaccinated last year. Overall, 19 cases considered severe, key benchmark assessing waning 

Only breakthroughs happened July-Aug period counted; earlier ones not.  tests EU countries cost less 3 euros.      want point article antiBODY test antigen test. Many replies talking rapid home antigen tests determine person current Covid infection - completely different use case. 

This test would able tell making antibodies either vaccine previous infection. Since takes immune system weeks create antibodies, cannot identify current Covid infection. Wow sounds horrific. still side effects long Covid? USA accept Sputnik legit vaccine, issue That's kind amazing. friends Auckland. I've islands. country ridiculously beautiful!  


We people covid tiny town US NZ whole country. interesting see long NZ hold zero covid strategy sustainable.

I’m hoping keep covid Qld vaccination rates high enough.  Hope stay safe. patients antivaxx Covid deniers?  mix strong coercive methods governments + population still overly afraid covid sees much dangerous deadly is. even think culture plays much role latest Delta outbreaks uptake low-ish especially among elderly. never occurred me.

However, actually pretty great. don’t, pretend doesn’t exist. finally see it, they’re themselves, it’s late get vaccinated anyway, gasping air ventilator would dissing barely week social media.  I’m sure that…I think there’s strong correlation lacking empathy deniers. mean even sick, long survive many often get back anti-vacation BS. working home virtual learning means slave masters can't manipulate control, force employees waste time money commuting. get vaccinated choose selfish piece shit.   feel like balance 0.0004% chance child hospitalized via covid risk develop mental health issues locked down.  went Aranet4 reading way many reviews. accurate far tell (always measures outside air correctly) require regular calibrations like units, though quite pricy. early pandemic statement

You mean thing medical professionals said? 4 kids. totally get irrational panic plenty it.  


But far hierarchy risk children face daily basis, covid statistically far list even feels like number 1. Today, high murder rate 5 per 100,000! means covid right high murder rate! So, pay work. complicated.

Yeah, exactly this. know hard understand. point, relatively young two shots, fear severe disease death close zero. main fear exactly said (plus long COVID). Texas, tbf parts state speed limit actually 85 mean, populations grow, total deaths becomes less useful metric, even things improve, total deaths still increase time.

Covidiots taking space resources hospitals regular folks need refuse fucking vaccine. fucking hate dumb people.   vaccinated standby intelligent patients treated first, well non covid related issues. god sound all-powerful. Also dismissed pretty eloquently Stephen Colbert. main question it’s better use boosters vaccinate unvaccinated people elsewhere world. Every booster shot one less first dose third world, vaccine production still larger demand. 

Personally think booster shots make sense, need make sure administered earlier needed. I’m saying people responsible actions. Surely notion republican would object to.  get point wouldnt 2020 already big chance highest death toll anyway amount time passed determine restrictions get lifted. Infection rates, deaths, impact health care systems looked at.  never saw anyone refuse those. never thought it. I'm pretty sure get booster now. Many people shoes already have.

 stomach issues 3 days, spending one night vomiting 8 hours straight went hospital 3 morning told Appendicitis two hours waiting. Another 5 hours passed got room another 4 hours could put operating table. much pain kept morphine almost entire time there. Told soon opened up, like within minutes appendix ruptured like cyst made recovering much difficult keep extra two weeks since werent sure fluid would cause abscess abdomen scanned me.

One team members said swollen appendix ever seen, certain waited another day, even stuck hours longer could've died.

 Covid taking space hospital. imagine mightve happened go now. Sounds great. I’m jealous aren’t Seattle. Religions general ok vaccines, except anti medicine. work healthcare believe something anti medicine? Stupid. 

I’m Covid nurse. I’ve also twice got vax (Pfizer). 

Now come home, leave work stuff (that actually bring home) garage wipe/spray it, spray shoes, strip totally naked garage. bag scrubs/under scrubs/cap/etc leave there, go directly shower. that, use Flonase, swear first Covid bout screwed sinuses forever. Neti pot. gargle thoroughly Listerine, brush teeth etc, take melatonin remaining vitamins, go bed. days, Flonase Neti pot twice gargle twice. trying keep stuff chance get comfy there…if possible. 

No ivermectin tho. iodine FFS!! think covid units/wings aren’t thing hospitals currently overloaded covid patients they’re busy put time process adjusting workflows fit new covid wing location. Discrimination recklessness today. Discrimination unfavorable ideas tomorrow. 

It's already problem general assembly neutral place like Geneva. Jehovah's Witnesses forbid vaccines. take day day thank asking. Sometimes that’s need, someone ask us we’re doing/if we’re ok. 😌 Idk hell guy is, tbh everyone who's opposed getting vaxxed sure jump non-FDA approved monoclonal antibody treatment pretty fast ""strong immune system"" starts failing they've begun experience covid's wrath. thing is, antibody treatment might even effective virus given enough time fester inside body. Seems me, guy answers pandemic would would given Nobel peace prize something. UN prohibiting member nations discussing headquarters. 

If start limiting diplomats interacting, reason UN.  Sounds unnecessary 🙃 misconception. technology J&amp;J's shot old fashioned. fact first adenovirus vector vaccine Ebola vaccine 2020. Coincidentally also developed J&amp;J. approved medical use EU last year.

J&amp;J indeed uses adenovirus, essentially used vessel contain genetic code make Covid spike proteins. 

mRNA thing, instead instructions suspended lipid nanoparticles. also reason kept cold.

The true ""old fashioned"" way involves growing batches virus(s) trying immunize weakening de-activating using heat chemicals. India's Covax China's Sinovac use Covid vaccines. Ya’ll lack reading comprehension man, I’m disappointed Great ass. brain. entire population, true. Again, works. people died 75 years age, comorbidities unvaccinated.

The data lets see probability young person healthy vaccinated extremely low. see CDC website less 15,000 people died 40. quick Google search yields 166 million people US 40. means probability dying covid forty. means 1 11,066 people age group died covid. add excellent health cut 66%. 1 33,535. exact data available true number deaths vaccinated people incredibly rare. CDC says something like 11 times less likely. would make risk 1 368,888. actually think risk somewhat lower this, comfortable risk. way, according national weather service, chance struck lightning 1 1.22 million. chance dying covid 3 times higher chance struck lightning.

So, worry stuff. vaccinated, really either.  Let's look side effects know right now. Fever uncommon, concerns around clotting, heart inflammation younger people. sure ended up. 

Just fever serious threat babies though major adults. FDA absolutely right understand risk vs efficacy.

If risk worth it, approved wide scale vaccination would cause harm covid situation.

Let experts job. Ignoring science either end dangerous. kind accepted 4yo get vaccinsted next spring join 5 group. plan militarize police incarcerate people hold opinion people get vaccine? aunt died hospital ICUs swamped covid cases take people (I'm India, happened second wave). Y'all opportunity stop happening, get fucking vaccine already. guess depends mean ""know"". mom died COVID ex-coworker sat behind younger me. One remote engineer talked online also died it. work mufti-national get many COVID obituaries weekly. And? LA never going hospital crisis good vaccination rate. goal prevent cases, prevent healthcare overload Hand horse dewormer leave God's hands. Apple thing? I’m positive phone nothing like that.

Dismiss worry toddler dying covid, risk. I'm Idahoan. blame them. collective IQ seriously low. Ah referring Firewire's figure way calculation. logical quibble. talking whether figure high low.
I agree number particular chain skewered towards either direction can't know current information.  Unfortunately many defer local health authorities they, business owners, medical experts. Honestly? Let unvaccinated die. (The unvaccinated choice is) Darwinism. impact still kicking someone home unacceptable

But that's home. They're paying temporary use landlord's property terms conditions. can't agree landlord's terms, leave landlord's property. They're entitled use someone else's property default. that's (people accepting unvaccinated covid patient) taking resources people would otherwise almost guaranteed chance recovery. Galileo served single day put house arrest (as practice time people age).

Do research dude. Thank taking time that.

Although rough number, seems came around 45% CFR IMV covid patients:

“Sixty-nine studies included, describing 57,420 adult patients COVID-19 received IMV. Overall reported CFR estimated 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39–52%).”

Is reasonable takeaway? 45% certainly good rate (35% either), especially given long patients covid left vents (compared diseases require IMV times). amount physical therapy, amongst things, required afterwards extensive.

I wish data easily accessible. I’m sorry dad. curious said “ER overrun unvaccinated COVID patients”. know 1. Unvaccinated 2. COVID? seems like tall assumption. much someone able pay [to kill personal choice spread plague. hazard safety others. lease provides option landlord end lease time reason.

You literally *never* see lease like that. completely invalidates point lease. Lol. makes nasal spray iota-Carrageenan. anyone know detailed plan expecting? going say I’d check local hotel 14 days.  could FDA check safety let kids get safe. cares precise efficacy stats—something better nothing. *really, seriously* going look back say ""yeah, Pfizer work kids. waste was."" 

Say ""we know effective, safe, give kid want. We'll let know get efficacy data."" ICU nurse, confirm fucking sucks lol ER. Rural area. know fewer toddlers killed covid 2020 people killed lightning average year, right?

Most states reported -a single death- child less 5 years old.

I know covid stressful, worth sanity check point risk avoidance balanced appropriately.  No, mistaken. vaccinated, safe. 

Long covid rare occurrence especially vaccinated people. vast majority symptoms clear less 21 days. Yes, hear it, mind something fearful of.

Yes, hear hospitals filling locations US. couple areas actually frequent. life far, never need emergency services hospital, anyone ever know. vast majority people non life threatening situations. take chances Texas Florida. 

I hear pregnant women dying. recall story pregnant woman dying. once. According quick Google search number pregnant people US 5% population 16 million. take chances 1/16 million.

Your last paragraph seems indicate think unvaccinated. set record straight, vaccinated days eligible. happily living vaccinated life. look actual risk make choices based hot hyperbole fear. lick balls? Big balls work trick building owned people actually live building, important decisions building operates made someone actually affected decisions.

And assure you, compensates whatever ""negative sides"" owning real estate imagine. owning real estate really terrible, wealthy would avoid like plague poor people would property. That's like 1 200 Republicans, right? article isn’t list open tourism countries. 

I mean glancing list, US it, don’t allow EU residents Canadians enter land border. doubt it’s accuracy. I've waited long well covid emergency room. anyone believe it’s likely vaccine booster effect? strangers get vaccine it’s waste. Yep idea rural people somehow isolated homesteads interact anyone complete bullshit. go churches, stores, restaurants. Fucking morons watched happen India no, still stupid vax, well stay home then. new review, published Lancet, experts said whatever advantage boosters provide would outweigh benefit using doses protect billions people remain unvaccinated worldwide. Boosters may useful people weak immune systems, said, yet needed general population.

This moving goalposts. question never whether doses would better served elsewhere. logic, young healthy people shouldn’t gotten vaccine at-risk people globally - that’s obviously approach US (or country access vaccines) took. dont much say except sorry you. truly hope recover. awful virus anyone else. go one walk vaccination events. happy see people lined get shot ask many questions. Oh mean online people looking jobs require vaccination . read article le, se one evicted. 

New leases offered vaccinated peoples, leases renewed occupants vaccinated.

Florida strong landlord’s rights - offer refuse lease reason protected anti-discrimination laws (so can’t reject based race). Either give us boosters resume getting back normal, say “this it, good it’s gonna get better get back normal, folks!”

“No boosters still mask take precautions!” acceptable. think public health experts better answer question. example giving people still good antibodies weeks booster shot would “earlier needed”. That’s needs clear guideline. 4, 5, 6 11 months needs calculated carefully evaluated. beyond furious this... want get vaccinated pretend COVID exist? Fine... That's you... long enough we've seen happens die COVID.

But personal choice means accepting responsibility actions consequences actions...

There need SERIOUS fucking consequences choosing get vaccinated healthy... Right every one people hogging space selfish thunk anyone themselves... need made feel consequences selfish behavior...

Whether thats de-prioritizing number COVID beds, making pay additional care patients actual medical emergencies require (the article said boy burst appendix ultimately survived, parents pay weeks hospital stay borrowing house... bill split unvaccinated Covid patients instead)...

Or whatever else might fair... lock people jail threaten kill people... Thats essentially unvaccinated right doing, need held account choices therr meed consequences.  No, it’s not. Lol. Scientists already said boosters needed studies proved it. Crappy politics holding now. important part headline former FDA scientists.

There issues data used fact published Lancet crazy.

This group isn’t part decision making process anymore. sorry loss family gone through.

I hope bury Ron like him. Yes, worried. vaccinated, wear mask, distance,avoid anything might require hospital visit. 

One scariest articles past week Alabama family tried (I think )46 different hospitals find transfer father heart attack. failed. died. Ah lovely, thank you. vaccinated person 60 gets mild case, might live household spread virus vulnerable household/family member dies. It’s almost like scientists aren’t using logical reasoning. think improving immunity throughout much population possible would cautious reasonable thing do. 
 
If you’re always reactive never proactive you’ll never get ahead virus. sorry deal it. best wishes recovery future really kind issue all. manufacturing bottleneck limit mostly fill finish, raw materials. counterintuitive is, easier scale production ton lipid-encased mRNA molecules bioreactor mix remaining materials put tiny glass vial. Reducing active ingredient would negligible impact production long bottleneck remains fill finish is. 

The reason reducing active dose noticeable side effects received Moderna vaccine. increase active ingredient may may triggered stronger, robust long term immune response - high dose probably needed booster. means people get fewer side effects, positive. 

Keep mind concerns myocarditis vaccines. Moderna linked slightly higher rates myocarditis, would logical reduce dosage believe - least boosters - would likely drive much difference immune response. 

All else equal - truly doubt primary driver - keep mind Moderna entirely dependent emergent mRNA vaccine field. want people associate mRNA vaccines out-on-your-ass-for-a-couple-of-days side effects either. sure comprehensive different states localities track this. Like home state 9/4/2021, 4,894,225 Virginians fully vaccinated COVID-19. people, 0.4% developed COVID-19, 0.017% hospitalized, 0.0038% died. There's absolutely proof weaken time. starved out, like several strains flu went extinct last year social distanced wore masks. report EUA panel might say something developers biotic pharmaceutical course work saw something prompted say that. addressed 60s civil rights act, dummy.

The unvaccinated protected class. that's kept thinking read it, would avoid fucking virus like plague avoid symptom/effect don’t turn away entirely. keep adequate reserve beds vaccinated people Covid non-Covid issues, give rest beds unvaccinated patients. Unvaccinated non-Covid patients tough, go hospital also probably get Covid. Oh, charge unvaccinated cover cost treating unvaccinated people. don’t want pay crap. let people decide grown adults think themselves. learned pandemic Australia nothing like thought was. police try using facial recognition software sure quarantined people stay home. send selfie home doesn’t match, police visit checkup. sucks cost never much. criminal makes USA unlivable many ways. Let’s say (made base 10 numbers illustration):

200 kids infected
100 kids (1/2) get tested, probably symptoms
the half don’t, due asymptomatic cases and/or parents don’t bother
1 kid ends hospital

The case hospitalization rate 1% (1/100)

The infection hospitalization rate 0.5% (1/200)

The reported numbers 1% hospitalization rate, actual risk kid 0.5%

There’s way know real value 200, 1% upper bound risk, real risk  has.. *how many* apartments!? depends test. Covid-19 vaccines (at least ones used western countries) stimulate production antibodies spike protein, whereas infection cause body produce antibodies multiple parts virus. design test specifically look antibodies virus-parts spike protein, pick infection induced immunity, vaccine induced immunity. say “discriminate” unvaccinated protected Fair Housing Act.

They aren’t. Sorry. 

And people gotten evicted pets, smoking, playing loud music. sure fantasy land you’re living in. honest, cathartic many. People angry frustrated people love dying highly contagious preventable disease. People losing loved ones, children becoming orphaned. negligence anti-vaxxers. USA right proper fucked half nation full assholes scream ""My body. choice."", choosing give shit ""choice"" KILLING hundreds!

You know videos would cathartic me? people dragged kicking screaming homes they're forcibly vaccinated. define ""needed""?  Fortunately, triage take account issues like employment status dependents. purely survival chances expected quality life. 20‐50 year-old always win 80 year-old. price consumer pays could different actually costs government providing subsidies. \*Disclaimer - neither scientist medical professional, somebody asked question last weekend believe depends test. understanding vaccine would make body produce antibodies spike protein. natural response virus, body would take look actual virus produce antibodies various structures encounters outside virus, effective others.

Edit mean post soon - 

&amp;#x200B;

At least

1. depends Antibody test
2. Doctors prescribing antibody tests unless medically relevant (i.e. long-covid symptoms want get bottom issue)
3. test EUA best, works, tell article agree you’re saying. problem stuff like kernels truth. People say “we’re going get anyway” aren’t wrong. - us least - eventually exposed sufficiently high number virus particles would cause disease us unless prior immunity (and sometimes cause disease even already immunity). 

The problem people say usually mean “we’re going get anyway, what’s point delaying, let’s stop masks stop testing stop vaccines, get everyone infected, endemic new normal level life world, rather regularly consider new facts appear”. mean, extent opinions thought well enough form thought like that. 

The goal medical community public health messaging also get point enough people either disease acquired vaccine induced immunity. BUT, also recognize immediately get exposed, sending let’s say 10% America’s non-immune population hospital, that’s probably ~150 million non immune people let’s say 15 million hospital visits. can’t handle son weeks. around 900k total hospital beds (not ICU beds). death rate would 1% 2% cases people can’t access medical treatment, might 5 10%. medical public health communities saying need SLOWLY spread virus (by masking, distancing, etc.), significant percentage population immunity vaccination disease acquired sources. hopefully move forward this. 

So - sure. There’s kernels truth saying “everyone’s going get anyway”. they’re missing really important piece information there.  Is't Sweden UK same? Domestic travel only. trivial two legit cards, like 5+ million other... fear risks virus take action.... fear paper work.... enjoy angry still risk, paperwork.

So sorry shitty club me. saying know people infected three times vaccinated twice? might want visit psychologist. Holy shit, sounds like harrowing experience. yeah, completely get it, ER realizing entire department getting chuckle expense really embarrassing experience. 

I tried compassion situation, ER doc/nurse heavy, bleak job times. There's lot death, lot gruesome injuries, lot people really bad shape general. imagine take lightness find it, someone comes that's wrong poop, well, ok sure see that's little bit funny.

But could tell one thing nurses, funny poop jokes wait tell around nearly caused die want mocked like serious emergency. keep taking boosters lives. ridiculous... fucks brain, heart lungs. I've seen lung pics, wanted brain pics. Unfortunately not. She’s psycho tho lol. Doctors telling 2 diff things. primary care doctor( think that’s it’s called) telling wait pregnancy. didn’t think enough info pregnant woman. also specialist (she risk preeclampsia hypertension. see guy too.) told take it. works home. places usually goes pick daughter daycare. So, thought could cautious enough pregnancy. I’m pretty sure one day told pick rack ribs Walmart fir that’s got sick. almost made without incident. Ultimately got Covid deliver august 12th. due sept. 22nd. got Covid pretty much gave preeclampsia. Luckily chose hospital specializes high risk woman made Covid wing. scary. She’s vaccinated now. First shot 1 week ago. doesn't. garbage person. would save life antivaxxer day. issue covid patients take beds weeks. er filled covid patients, get admitted, someone needing acute care may show later week find beds.

Many pregnant women deliver prematurely ventilators, try save avoid damage babies oxygen deprivation. It’s two different groups people dude. fact medicine *compared U.S., bad students given deadline, warned, blame. problem whatsoever! totally understand. We’re majority immune compromised, result, don’t get scientific attention suppressed do. Understandable, frustrating. 

Fingers crossed make boosters widely available next week. even don’t, doctors agreement need third shot, I’d say perhaps makes sense get one CVS Walgreens wherever, even might mean totally honest. 

Stay safe!  We’re talking Covid here, anything else. likely antivax “Pay money right thing!” think viruses created human influence? Come on. Plus tend antivax metro areas.  It’s always fault responsible, isn’t it. 

🙄 triage based quality probability outcome given resources. severity need. Two people show showing signs heart attack. going die without treatment. enough resources save one. One 90 one 45. going save 45 year old. 90 year old die.

In example let's say save hand meat grinder. triage won't, going stop bleeding, cut send home. option save hand waste resources table. Triage much complicated appear believe.  Cue ""Yeah, Illegals vaccinated! They're letting in"". 

Dear, they're ***ILLEGALLY*** here; they're entering US undocumented means, there's way document vaccination status. They're already breaking law deported majority cases. SoCal districts went back July 21st. cases, largely line community spread, it’s going well. great, well.

I’m smug though, easily still go sideways especially elementary population. 12+ 90% vaccinated area though. believe released data, time strong statement made like without data backing it, shady. matter makes statement.  Idaho legal framework hospital can't held liable follow guidelines. guidelines publishes evaluate patients ability thrive, low score (old, co morbidities, etc) receive full court press measures, receive comfort measures possible. 

This ""hospitals failing"" single catastrophic event, slow motion train wreck individual cars falling off. already canceled elective surgeries, they're postponing procedures bar ""urgent"" gets higher. point could theory patient who's urgent enough, cross threshold triaged care all. 
Like line Red October, ""This going get hand, people going die"", except right now, going to.  went reservation got Moderna 3rd 2 Pfizer’s. febrile 2 days got better.  data Moderna effective I’m happy choice.  I'd curious graph looks like eliminate first three months (March May) since doctors still learning treat covid time. Yes.  🤣 Look. Bigger problem, sized problem, smaller problem. don’t know honestly neither you. problems. wild. makes much sense Catholics getting vaccine, despite fact literal Pope encouraged it. sure many clue takes get green card become citizen. rights apply process really. give fingerprints, lot personal info, gone family history, vaccine requirements, medical checkup.

I fairly sure none deleted citizenship approved.

Do care though? really. Yeah, fallacious argument leads reader believe since 100% effective 0%, instead somewhere actually is. Yes, that's said unmasked people people eating restaurants. people unmasked eating restaurants, too, though think generally people masked delta became prevalent. indoor mask mandates come back place pretty much enforcement. Outdoors, many people stoppef masking entirely. I'm SF proper though, that's asked located. Dr. F isn’t fool. took Moderna. Earth wouldn’t follow lead? Pfizer Diet Moderna. green card application physical. needed proof I'd dTap MMR (this added covid vax). said would younger (I'm 36). Getting records Britain would taken ages got another MMR jab!

As hypocritical, see that. think *can*, they're power mad anything people vaccinated better country is. It'd completely impossible make every American born citizen vaccinations, can't even get get deadly pandemic! claim ""it's places fully open overloaded"" 

That's true, places vaccine policies mask mandates packed well. That's saying. understand extra parents Idaho, ""dangerously close rationing care"" Idaho came picture. Everyone knows microchips big fit syringe Good Lords squeak tiniest spots ;) Can't throw people inner circle window, powerful friends. lowly musician, activist, journalist different story. really freaks colleges, despite vaccine mandates, seem going back last years circumstances. Zero covid campuses aren’t gonna happen. 

Once kids get vaccinated next semester totally normal, maskless all. fear won’t though I’m depressed.  Vaccine denial needs crime  harming anyone. That's disagree.

False. Unvaccinated people harming people.

* Unvaccinated people likely get/spread COVID. 
* Unvaccinated people frequently ending hospital, taking away care people (cancer patients, heart attack patients, etc.). see recent news states rationing care, cancelling surgeries, postponing treatment, hospitals full mostly unvaccinated COVID patients. 
* Unvaccinated preventing herd immunity, putting immunocompromised /suppressed people increased risk contracting dying COVID. Sure, people advocate get vaccine, bodies may produce enough antibodies. depend society protect them.
* Sure, wait natural herd immunity, wait virus burn communities, many people die need ask to. grandparent lower immune response vaccine simply age. patient autoimmune disease can't take vaccine lower immune response vaccine steroids take. cancer patient whose MRI tumor removal cancelled, leading cancer spread become less treatable. That's deaths. long-covid harm? psychological harm healthcare workers? psychological harm family members lose 1, 2,3+ loved ones. harm child grows without dad? 

Nobody harming anyone beyond false.  boss’ attitude least change? think Dr. F got Moderna? knows he’s doing. Love new Gov Sure things mattered past, point current move CDCs orange tier (the subject thread) really linked masking, least per observed data, using many metros control. 

Not trying argue masks make huge difference 70+% SF vaccinated. obvious did.  guidance stick got. I’m sure could find pharmacy doesn’t care, though would personally stick Pfizer unless change guidance. booster bring sky high levels. People need learn history. Vaccination revolutionary event. random thing we're still trying figure out. creating new types vaccines nothing new, either. Jenner's vaccine transformative enough, Pasteur created entirely new types, honoring Jenner's invention founding discipline microbiology vaccinology. models mechanisms vaccine development documented rich literature going back two centuries, studied world over. something trivial taken lightly. literally changed history humanity, agriculture, civilization generations ago grandparents' grandparents born. know anything booster shots yet. Booster shots approved, may approved outside elderly immunocompromised groups. way written, read comment commented on. Numbers might look different look cases May 2020 March 2021. first wave localized North East high tax states. second wave beyond spread nationwide hit many much poorer states. Looking post-March 2021 would also show picture post-vaccines.

edit: Also, Wolfram Dashboard data April 2021, making analysis date. wait, matter time come Uber Ambulance. get it, deaf. also asshole. could easily communicate via text note taking application phone. like right now. in, received tattoo within certain amount time (6 months, iirc), get smallpox vaccine. suffered strokes life, really would want go hospital Don’t worry. people would take shot month could. Looks like got Moderna you’re good shape. one arguing 100%, op implying 100% 0%. makes comment misinformation best. really dense? Possibly, viruses link triggering diabetes anything new. discussed lot years. You’ve literally take vaccines elementary schools, college, military, workplaces, travel decades. Centuries actually. It’s choice.

Personally, I’m protected covid don’t give shit people do. can’t “choose” wear mask follow travel bans limits. life 100% back normal, metic, yes everyone get vaccine, shunned society whole.

Good luck seeing major news networks social platforms embracing nuanced take though.  think made bit typo meant link (may swapped 1 7 url): quite bit evidence J&amp;J less effective. I'm convinced Moderna effective Pfizer. studies show significant difference even though one does. 

Pfizer approved earlier ended given higher risk population compared Moderna. study adjust time since vaccination like others do. said risk J&amp;J little data CDC FDA extremely slow provide new guidance anything change.

This really important point think lot people missing. people claiming J&amp;J vaccine trial showed 100% effectiveness hospitalization death without mentioning giant confidence intervals. *Homer*  smartass, data there? see link article preprint, I'd like see raw data age/time frame/etc.

Taking data raw numbers provide, There's 30% people pool earlier(14k vs 11k) vaccinated people 70% time (average 12 months 7 months). So, without knowing data taking face value, calculate 98 infections per 100k people per month ((162/12/14000) \* 100k) earlier vaccinations 114 per 100k people per month (88/77/11000) \* 100k) recent vaccinations, basically shows less breakthrough infections. smaller time frame obviously help earlier vaccinations.   entire point boosters deal waning antibodies allow Delta break through. Giving third dose prevents happening large degree gets recipient back ~95% levels protection. 

Considering that, reformulating would bad plan.  Russia pushing anti-vax sentiments? don’t say.  Stop treating unvaxxed. TLDR kids don’t wear masks … Sounds like it’s still development might while.

That’ll approximately $9284.86” U.S. Insurance cover 2%. it’s worth, vaccines really thing worried long term. mechanisms antigen cleared body subsequent immune response pretty damn well understood it’s done it’s kinda… done. kinda “long term” vaccines like medications. unvaccinated covid patients still getting full access hospital. doesn’t hospital allow certain amount beds unvaccinated leave rest emergencies. vaccinated treatment.  point vaccine protect yourself. landlord staff vaccinated worry covid. nothing new here. Landlords already set rules considered discriminatory protected classes. Eg cannot say Asians whatever. always say Alligators new air filter like what? $30/month spread across hours employees? even penny increase wage probably. methods expensive that, basic things doing. one client worker gets sick without it, cost probably much worker actually contributes. article mentioned cited link gave you. “Before withdrawal, paper viewed 150,000 times, cited 30 times included number meta-analyses collect trial findings single, statistically weighted result. one recent meta-analysis American Journal Therapeutics found ivermectin greatly reduced COVID-19 deaths, Elgazzar paper accounted 15.5% effect.”

So basically journal part multiple citations given paper discredited. local hospital straight told people come. One relative told would 2 day wait ER could see him

It’s wild spread matter hospitals ok? get covid 20+ times throughout lives cold user made 3 claims:

1. Rural people less informed (presumably urban counterparts, least comparison average).

2. Rural people easily misled...

3. Rural people receive less accurate information (my paraphrase)...

I think claims worth asking proof. I'm rejecting claims - I'm asking hear whether there's reason believe basis evidence. context refer makes sound bit like might asked believe claims tribalist basis, think would mistake.    Well, sucks, don’t think prioritizing like first come, first served situation. hospital staff dong job. Now, think people don’t want get vaccinated, forfeit right medical care, don’t trust medical establishment anyway. put money mouth take stupid horse medicine essential oils home. Screw them. got notice Contra Costa County requiring proof vaccination neg test indoor business' starting Sept 22.

A welcome surprise honest. County health dept fucking around anymore. county lagged behind bay area counties vaccinations hopefully help. forcibly vaccinated? advocating forced vaccinations?  hope able get surgery need soon possible. Best wishes them. Proud Angelino. I'm convinced Moderna effective Pfizer

why convinced? read Moderna produces antibodies, mean effective? N95 Masks portable air filter, help. Multi-pronged approaches best. like 7 tools help prevent covid spreading. necessarily need use time, single tool good enough. understand denying assistance patients violation sort, section emergency room regular problems instead overrun covid patients would solve lot issues like this. sucks even happening ER already take long enough get seen. Sounds like it.  high compliance, *that guy* always 60s. obvious wouldn’t commented.  vaccine recommend Pfizer moderna? jnj seems question 80% population vaxxed live, hospitals still overwhelmed overwhelmed years now. health care system broken fact people vaccinated. wait, tinfoil hats find something claim turns brains mush something.   kind sad though. mean heck get here. let virus take world change lives forever. also dined restaurant quite time disagreeing I'm sad state in. able dine friends restaurant part culture think might gone forever sad. Moderna mrna, basically Pfizer, except stronger dosage, probably creates stronger immune response. Eventually enough people worldwide vaccinated and/or natural exposure new variants slow cases fall take pressure medical system.

If want get faster, advocate policies get people vaccinated vaccine aid poor countries next immune evading variant won’t bring us back 4th major wave. vAcCiNaTeD cArE iM nOt!!

Cause need go hospital dumbass ventilator sitting bed.    country 14 days quarantine well 72 hours symptom free.

So still symptomatic day 13 continue quarantine. Toledo Public Schools suburban districts require masks. case bigger cities?  saw actually. Also, solving whole lot heck faster. Pestilence  health officials Los Angeles County begin requiring proof COVID-19 vaccination patrons workers indoor bars, wineries, breweries, lounges nightclubs next month.

I’d love hear rationale restaurants recommended check vaccine status. It’s even accurate went back 1900, though knows records then. Thanks link, I'll update original comment!

To point, amazing willing public health officials science communicators willing *fudge* science make seem like J&amp;J equivalent vaccines plays risks. heres joke- people dont take vaccine. gone school south, every single kid knew couldn’t read write involved sort sport. kid like class got used grades pushed however many points took kids passing tests. officials rule kids couldn’t play sports got failing grade, teacher gonna get shit reason kid couldn’t play upcoming game, solution bend rules kids “passed”.

BACKGROUND 
BNT162b2 lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 highly efficacious coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) currently approved, conditionally approved, authorized emergency use worldwide. time initial authorization, data beyond 2 months vaccination unavailable. 
 
METHODS 
In ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years age older 2264 participants 12 15 years age receive two 30-μg doses, 21 days apart, BNT162b2 placebo. trial end points vaccine efficacy laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 safety, evaluated 6 months vaccination. 
 
RESULTS 
BNT162b2 continued safe acceptable adverse-event profile. participants adverse events leading withdrawal trial. Vaccine efficacy Covid-19 91.3% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 89.0 93.2) 6 months follow-up among participants without evidence previous SARS-CoV-2 infection could evaluated. gradual decline vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy 86 100% seen across countries populations diverse ages, sexes, race ethnic groups, risk factors Covid-19 among participants without evidence previous infection SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy severe disease 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 99.9). South Africa, SARS-CoV-2 variant concern B.1.351 (or beta) predominant, vaccine efficacy 100% (95% CI, 53.5 100) observed. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Through 6 months follow-up despite gradual decline vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 favorable safety profile highly efficacious preventing Covid-19. (Funded BioNTech Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728. opens new tab.) think part data coming Pfizer performs poorly long term, maybe regards Delta well, Moderna. also question much testing, finding asymptomatic cases. really hard compare country country, feel like anymore, different approaches show different results.

I'm really torn booster. I'm fan administration jumping ahead science. definitely think there's group population needs boostered, going mess make people even splintered going bad look across board. say someone get booster I'm told I'm eligible.

I think right, 100%, pushed through. much hospitalizations/deaths breakthroughs, curb spread via breakthroughs. Especially ages vaccinated, people tolerate much mitigation. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

BACKGROUND 
On July 30, 2021, administration third (booster) dose BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) approved Israel persons 60 years age older received second dose vaccine least 5 months earlier. Data needed regarding effect booster dose rate confirmed coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) rate severe illness. 
 
METHODS 
We extracted data period July 30 August 31, 2021, Israeli Ministry Health database regarding 1,137,804 persons 60 years age older fully vaccinated (i.e., received two doses BNT162b2) least 5 months earlier. primary analysis, compared rate confirmed Covid-19 rate severe illness received booster injection least 12 days earlier (booster group) received booster injection (nonbooster group). secondary analysis, evaluated rate infection 4 6 days booster dose compared rate least 12 days booster. analyses, used Poisson regression adjusting possible confounding factors. 
 
RESULTS 
At least 12 days booster dose, rate confirmed infection lower booster group nonbooster group factor 11.3 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 10.4 12.3); rate severe illness lower factor 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 29.5). secondary analysis, rate confirmed infection least 12 days vaccination lower rate 4 6 days factor 5.4 (95% CI, 4.8 6.1). 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
In study involving participants 60 years age older received two doses BNT162b2 vaccine least 5 months earlier, found rates confirmed Covid-19 severe illness substantially lower among received booster (third) dose BNT162b2 vaccine. longer Texas North?

No. weird they're even making wait long, 15 minutes recommendation.

I fear. experts predicting another wave winter, considering spring semester probably start right peak wave (considering last year winter wave peaked early January), I'm afraid would influence many professors make classes hybrid/remote. Hell yes! I've long proponent idea religious exemptions laws strictly reserved religions prove factually correct. know who's also forced get vaccinated?? Military members! Even covid required get vaccinated 17 different diseases.

Come fuck dude. catch fine dog vaccinated rabies. god forbid get vaccinated keep grandma dying miserably ventilator. appreciate sentiment, try reading article commenting next time.  Dumbest comment day.

Vaccination PREVENT infection, everyone get vaccine, chance getting infection would probably like .000000000000000000001%.  That's cases measles YEARS anti-vax idiots decided wanted stop vaccinating children. unvaccinated people lead cases turn cause people, herself, get infected.

It's basic logic require much brain power figure out, appears that's difficult you.  I’ve wondered too. vaccinated HCWs state got Moderna — first vaccine first week January. difference couldn’t 2-3 weeks. Curious much difference could make.  freedom choose, nobody dragging street jab them. hospitals freedom employ them. freedom taken away. Wrong. 

Type diabetes isn’t like type 2. don’t develop insidious symptoms time. 

It’s acute. body stops producing insulin goes DKA. Kid generally fine, gets flu like symptoms. think it’s nothing. lethargy vomiting starts go ED type 1 confirmed.

Completely backwards guy. 

Ps. Ultimately answer question , yes , okay strongly held belief adulterers stone. 

I don’t agree , opinion. Rastafarians do, part wider distrust western medicine. one reasons vaccine scepticism vaccine didn’t FDA approval back then. literally couldn’t Yeah, address thread. Honest question, israel one data studies? hate assumption long COVID permanent.

The human body extraordinarily good self-repair. Sometimes takes longer want to, doesn’t mean won’t happen.

We shouldn’t telling people long COVID they’re permanently disabled don’t know that’s true - make feel depressed discouraged could end unnecessarily hindering chances recovery.

There recent longitudinal study immune inflammatory markers people COVID-19 - people long COVID weren’t returning normal quickly, still trending direction people faster recovery. Nah, even smokers get lung transplants, fwiw. don’t need approved transplant recipient order access emergency care treatment. could even tell baseline shift deep south? appreciate you. disease jerk also afflicts people POTS cardio makes things way worse. Almost pass levels worse. 

You absolutely right. misinformation horrible. start, got page of: really new scale, know means least years cautious. went Vegas sweet spot summer, think week returned indoor mask mandates. went group none us got COVID Delta definitely picked since July. go, avoid nightclubs bars-- easily places felt least comfortable. space casinos, pools restaurants comfort level. Mask up. Damn right!!! Weird. German press reports new Israeli study dispositive. 

For example Munich's big paper, SZ, says today: 

""Since beginning September, people 60 offered refresher corona protection. useful that? look Israel gives pretty straightforward answer."" Yes. simple pharmacy vaccine. much ICU type resources military have? I’d imagine it’s pretty small compared AHS. quarantine even setting food. disingenuous pretend China open Europe us  Yeah told it’s best see doctor. also read certain time since vaccination get ill, could unrelated coincidental timing. hopefully it’s allergies common cold. hasn’t got Covid symptoms that’s good! Thanks replying :) haven’t seen elections yet COVID deaths would really move needle blue. Urban &amp; Rural death rate vaccines rolled mid-spring. That's horrible. glad u vaxed. well. wish ppl would be.  Even locked everyone inside houses, zero spread whatsoever, we’d still weeks increasing demand ICU people already caught it.

This catastrophic public policy failure, many unnecessary deaths still come. quarantine long time, pretend come go buy plastic sleeve it. Don’t laminate want booster. 

Edit: typo strongly held religious belief adulterers stoned. 

You saying that's OK? people making people homeless refusing vaccinate, even knowing going require future lease renewals. making decision, decision means get move. Idaho people failed flatten curve face consequences warned about. Good luck them.  That's got covid early people tested 65+ hospitalized (which full denying patients).

I predict that's going kick high gear kids 12 vaccinated result going sort general attitude ""you get deserve"". lot people going die it. Moderna gamble. Pfizer/BioNTech gambled little.

Scary, indeed people turn back science.  interesting see Thailand South Africa fair. fairly large countries ~60 million, more, people. remaining countries people representative anything. still get occasional moron spouting virus harmless children. message everywhere couple months ago. amazing degree ignorance general population. 

You know virus. can't tell people harmless children. never got data make claim. Considering serious stance China taking towards COVID, would expect would come perps like ton bricks. all, someone might use one cards gain entry China, kick infections.

Side question. Earlier year, multiple times last year recently, directly exposed people tested positive ended symptomatic. I've tested every time even instances allergies act precaution, negative. I'm active live healthy lifestyle, lot health issues. Could immune system fought infection around people? novel virus, figure immune system would know fight (?) infected?

If could over, I'd wait little longer getting it. got exactly 6 months second dose. that's exactly idea people fired. take never met stubborn people life before. data see brought current level immunization two shots mostly protects severe disease 6 months.

Supposedly that's covering something like 38% global population (presumably factor double/triple doses). suspect large amount people already vaccinated easy reach places: Wealthy countries and/or urban areas good refrigeration transportation infrastructure. people countries refusing vaccine, let's ignore focus folks want vaccine can't get yet. think reaching many people, especially ones live remote places going lot difficult. mRNA vaccines might right way given cold chain storage requirements.

Vaccines finite good. make fast, wealthy nations sitting surplus waiting see boosters needed vulnerable general population donate areas greater need. perfect world would agree global pandemic better everyone covered least 1 dose give 3rd doses, given political need protect population, question become *how* beneficial 3rd dose is. Right evidence pretty clear almost certainly highly beneficial blood cancer patients organ transplant patients, probably highly beneficial immunocompromised patients elderly. whether 20 times protective 5 times protective could well deciding factor whether vaccines get reserved donated, means need consider methodological flaws studies like one. Even care lives suffering people poorer countries, risk rampant spread could give rise another dangerous variant quite real threatens populations. good idea critically examine one's beliefs every then, seek new information, see we've believed thus far actually still aligns (or want be) now.

I go UB hot fucking mess.  Stupid stupid does. Get vaccinated please.  good time accidents. Stay home chill weekend, everyone. really understand reasoning.

When look situation right I'm rather dismayed. huge number countries like 60-70% vaccination rates. enough keep highly contagious variants like delta circling around infecting vaccinated people. individuals may typically severe symptoms huge risk vaccine resistant mutations occuring already highly infectious variant (think delta spread mu-like vaccine resistance). either need vaccinate whole population reduce spread enough delta mostly die introduce boosters keep vaccinated people getting infected. exception might also show people infected way tend achieve super-immunity (which possibility, think we've adequately shown yet).

Unless willing start strapping anti-vaxxers tables forcibly inject seems like boosters best bet prevent vaccinated people getting virus potentially creating new super variant. Unvaccinated populations absolutely risk need treated, there's selective pressure vaccine resistance. Ideally moving countries 1 1 vaccinating entire population one go. Gotta watch disgusting Tito-19 innocent foolish? Many post hateful memes supporting violence, racism sexism. hoping super powers like able fly super strength  include Applebee's places like that? also eat pretty cheaply. fact microwave food also meet criteria. 

I find assertion working class can't afford eat restaurants frankly insulting working class people. know plenty working class people go eat occasion. Well, think assumptions come much covid like sars 2003, people 'long sars' still it, decades later unsure perm not. Yes, though doesn’t help vaccine conflicts feel think know. get proper counseling instead people bashing without context. Meaning going get worse? That’s really point. I’m well aware could go get one dishonestly. may end that, I’d much rather not.

But main point keeping society type limbo acceptable me. boosters worthwhile, awesome, roll em out. they’re not, need really begin moving society feel regulatory agencies hindering talking sides mouths: “you’re safe enough without booster, need! don’t forget keep wearing mask altering aspects life cause covid!”

If don’t need boosters that’s fine, see sides argument make sense depending goals are. obviously help mitigate infection transmission, particularly short-term. even protection wanes they’re still heavy lifting keeping people getting severely ill dying. go route boosters recommended, end mask mandates type restriction vaccinated. that’s safe do, use damn boosters make so. Protect unborn, get vaccinated. mean like protecting unborn Texas right?

Hospitals flooded. flood hospitals use a) vaccine b) stupid amount time quarantine.  Eugenics Wars, come Hurry wait!  Maybe God created virus clean people refuse vaccine! one dimensional calling agenda feels disingenuous. waning conclusive recommendation boosters healthy adults far sure strong argument feel addressed yet. one coworker caught Covid ended hospital pre-vaccine. ended getting vaccine anyways said afford another hospital stay take chance catching again, even small.

I'll upvote you, back napkin math numbers brief released Moderna differ post yesterday.

Taking data raw numbers provided, there's 30% people pool earlier(14k vs 11k) vaccinated people 70% time (average 12 months 7 months). So, without knowing data age breakdown taking face value, calculate 98 infections per 100k people per month ((162/12/14000) \* 100k) earlier vaccinations 114 per 100k people per month (88/77/11000) \* 100k) recent vaccinations, basically shows less breakthrough infections. That’s peer reviewed wanna check   Moderna likely giving half dose booster. it'll likely matter approval given.

So taken group conmen, natural spread word believe truth. think fooled people forgivable, spreading that. 

What forgivable closing eyes ears reality, electing ignore cling position hurts people. 

The sticking point many people convinced conmen believe mainstream media liars, trust evidence ears eyes alone. evidence numbers facts, conceptual things, compelling, visceral things grasp senses. 

The way convince people expose truth, let light day sear away illusions we're facing. need take ICU listen ever-present alarms people struggling breathe. need make watch someone die COVID-19, horribly tearfully struggling live little longer. need make witness exhaustion doctors nurses struggling keep up. 

I energy hate wish ill upon people still blinded false beliefs recited charismatic charlatans. priority right convincing truth, way can. truth comes price deaths, sad truth hopefully spread friends family.

The ones call hate upon, ones perpetuate falsehoods knowingly. May die, guilt-ridden alone. collapse healthcare system.

Which leads question, USA hit hard? Variolation would probably work, generally less effective vaccination causes scar tissue grow lead keloids years later.

There reason everyone stopped using variolations favor vaccination. Medical misinformation aside, fiancee called wedding medical issue, business getting married first place.  know, know. pretty cool getting vaccine way thought I’d get it, I’m hoping pull strings. Thanks telling us it’s going  course funded Pfizer BioNTech. product. natural pay certification. true field approval process. stove kitchen approval process paid company built it. distrust that? car? stop driving learn company paid crash tests? thing actual medical researchers put time studying. shouldn’t swallow povidone iodine, dilute povidone iodine quite effective killing SARS-CoV2 (and SARS, MERS). mom full hysterectomy cancer fall. ended ICU afterwards due complications I'm eternally grateful even open bed her.    would bet correlates vaccination rates rural vs urban areas. course. want sell product, better also pay process gets approved. That's true field, medical. 

And incidents companies tried weasel way ""sponsored"" studies, many safeguards prevent that.

Given high profile studies, many people watching looking irregularities. doubt could slip anything fishy, even wanted to. Unvaccinated people anti-maskers lot blood hands Sadly idiots still think flu Mainly Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna, provided government residents.  
Some took Astra-zenica, Sinovac Sinopharm, that's couple percent. 

Singapore's hospitalization rate probably driven paranoia anything else, hospital seem admit covid-19 patients drop hat, also might account insanely high survival rates.

[1] It’s absolutely absurd university couldn’t mask mandate even wanted it’s banned state legislature.

What possible rational could passing law cynically trading lives Texans cheap political clout. It’s disgusting. individualistic right till roads, ambulances, hospitals required. Apparently people searching companies required vaccines hiring felons now. Interesting. Check podcast, covers much past episodes!  Well then. Harvard review dated February 19, 2021, claims West Virginia ""has one highest vaccination rates country."" 
        
Sadly, many West Virginia population apparently disliked Harvard review decided misinformation propaganda better reality, facts, science.    
     
As September 15, 2021, [CDC Data shows percent West Virginia population age 12 years older fully vaccinated 46%, second-lowest percent among 50 U.S. states District Columbia. 
       
In contrast, population ≥12 years fully vaccinated, Vermont 77.8%, Connecticut 77.3%, Massachussetts 76.5%.  think early say, virus still new. another three years might pretty good idea things headed. I'm big fan renter protection, custom made allow deadly diseases spread. press conference weeks ago, mentioned non-pharmaceutical measures like masks, tracing app, hand hygiene, social distancing still necessary tackle autumn/winter wave. (and US) vaccination rate high enough avert high incidence effect hospitals.
Germany loose restrictions, areas cases spiked put others, milder comparison, place. scientific consensus still need measures rely vaccination alone year. get jealous New Zealand. NICUs filling preemies unvaccinated moms, latest numbers per CDC. don’t believe give hospitalizations v number cases, hospitalizations per 100,000, break weekly time periods/age groups/vaccination status. It’s pretty right time baby

implies bad decision. 45 - “Anyone defiling disease must wear torn clothes,let hair unkempt, cover lower part face cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’” Although really whole section leprosy. There’s really anyone make decision easier, it’s matter personal risk tolerance. personally would go enjoy myself, wear mask indoors, get tested trip case. guess?

I'm also saying really impact spread covid. Specially since urban people also likely socially distance, wear masks, sit talk different people there. Urban areas also options things like grocery delivery many rural areas don't. 

Since know rural areas getting hit harder urban areas now, I'm starting think living rural area give advantage getting it. I’ve watching NZ happy see cases seem control. Hope guys squash soon. (From Brisbane).  Black, Brown, White Yellow... ignorance, fear, mistrust, stubbornness kills. I'm still fighting relatives relations get vaccinated. people real danger people see reason. 

I know much refuse follow advice doctors, pleas family members begging friends. article said half Israel's 600 Covid hospitalizations fully vaccinated Pfizer. highly related time since last shot. rate breakthrough hospitalizations rising exponentially. initiated booster program faced inevitable rise deaths.

This must one studies FDA said take account -- refer last quote time article. people arrogant what? Read quote. Count out, horse dewormer buddy!  Nope. incorporated. like discrimination law. discrimination condition legally recognized deserving protection.  Glad live Alaska. 

I feel bad vaccinated people there. never plan eat inside restaurant again, correct. eat often heart desires... outdoors take out. problem killing themselves. also getting lots innocent people sick.  
 
Also, probably going unpopular opinion, view many ignorant people victims. wake one day choose crazy. subjects decades long targeted misinformation campaigns designed put constant state fear distrust towards anyone anything goes worldview that's crafted them.  
I'm trying claim accountable actions, important dehumanize them. people anomaly, freak genetic mutation. regular people like me, difference environment they've living in. circumstances, think people would them. people capable breaking free environment without outside assistance raised exception, rule. Interesting. clear I’m suggesting immune system worse reason need boosters covid (to keep antibodies around), getting minor infections perhaps don’t even get sick useful. Apparently Australia much higher flu rates last year normal little lockdown. 

I recognize link MIT common news sources source also specifically mentions usefulness infections children happening   watching live symposium hospital administrators across State Florida. One said roughly half fully vaccinated covid admissions asymptomatic admitted non-covid related reasons. found patients covid positive testing standard procedural requirement new admissions. wonder might also case elsewhere? saying urban environment people go multiple different locations means interacting kinds different people (pods) rural options far limited. ask it’s terrible take even considering abortion bans? Like would think it’s terrible time baby even abortion bans, like don’t even choice makes worse experience.  ""..**After months knocking doors** neighborhoods Palm Beach County, Florida, trying convince members community get vaccinated, Lisa Wilson said lost six members family Covid-19 three-week span....

Eye roll. think going happen?

Next time, everyone else post Facebook/Twitter/IG. least everyone home vaxxed yourself. go knocking 100 doors day chances get face full stuff bring home end week 3000% Religion law (or common decency). care God tells you, religion commands murder, give right commit murder suffer penalty. law society dictates people ought get vaccinated pandemic (a completely reasonable humanitarian request), religion can't shield that. Go live devout hermit rock sea somewhere can't comply. want part society, follow certain rules basic humanity. Religion excuse place desires everyone else. Exactly. personally morally testing healthy people sake testing...except specific circumstances (being around elderly/immune comprimised). constant testing even vaccinated feels like sort violation. It’s reason refused tested at-home kit.

I’m old enough experienced financial hardships pre-existing conditions clauses medical coverage. disease screamed pre-existing condition since beginning. don’t trust won’t return days healthcare coverage, particularly so, many Americans infected costs care continue mount. Someone going foot bill increased cost standard care evidence lingering effects also accumulates, would prefer one paying price years road if/when something like heart disease enter life, particularly since I’ve taken/am taking recommended precautions, including fully vaccinated strict mask-wearer. family Bay Area Kids infants?  mortgage precludes saving retirement?  Sucks them. Philadelphia sports fan, I’ve preparing whole life. “There’s always next year!” one somewhat mass testing colleges / universities university leveraging mask vaccine mandate. lot northern universities requiring three seems like stretch - suppose could argue college kids well college kids campus. point learn virus move mind easiest way get damn shot live life. 

&amp;#x200B;

As question - would say lot driven politics, people liberal northern states want testing peace mind people southern states along lines ""if die die"". believe see far testing, masking, vaccination mandates places really need citizens asking locations would extremely beneficial applied. 

As im living like 2019 agree depend vaccine made. friends got vaccine Pope said okay. convince friends Johnson Johnson using Human Embryonic Kidney cells research big deal either. vaccines pushed thay territory, would hard get people board. Luckily, case vaccines now. flu shot targets multiple different viruses, never know advance one dominant one flu season. addition, influenza mutates easily SARS-CoV-2.

Yearly covid-19 boosters seem unlikely point.

However, third shot strange all. look many vaccines, childhood vaccines, note often months doses. this? research apparently shown intervals give best long term protection. problem testing longer intervals takes lot time.

The covid-19 vaccines short interval 2 doses less shortest interval made sense. Longer intervals likely offer better long term protection, time test rolling vaccines. people getting shots, start investigate optimal interval be. Seems extremely low  government isn’t even admitting using software, huge red flag.

Per article, neither state home quarantine yet, neither state ""using"" yet. When/if do, it'll pretty obvious, installing app phone [the transparent use. Another Florida man story. Unbelievable. Please don’t ask people question, you’ll give new platform points! Eh every day passes they're catching up. Think they're gonna lockdowns decade now. college mandates vaccines routine mandated testing. It’s waste resources undermines confidence vaccines. I'm 38, likely I've exposed. idea got kid, I've never felt ""beaten up"" people often describe flu. Honestly, rarely respiratory diseases. annual cold spring allergies. wish would include statistics number children hospitalized vs cases something. 

Im trying downplay this. annoyingly protective side kid. want much information possible continue making informed decisions. 

I guess tough parse lot pediatric cases likely go unreported. Leadership needed emergency political posturing. Thank you.  Looking advice. trip planned Las Vegas two weekends booked back April (thinking would surely super low numbers now) celebrate large promotion work people. cannot decide go not. fully vaccinated since April, overweight, non-smoker, early 30s. wife feel great tell, giving much hell, now. also really want get it, I'm scared death possibly losing taste extended period time forever, also want long COVID symptoms. hand, know many people, including group friends came back Vegas, traveled ton work vacation none gotten sick. done literally nothing past 18 months sit house twiddle thumbs. think happened exposure low baseline, interaction seems like huge risk, but, Vegas we're talking about. Lol working class people regularly go bars pubs dude. thank you! I'll try Homie classic sign stress anxiety, could heart burn - eat anything tasty start slamming margaritas vaccination? 

I'd like say following

1. doctor suffer anxiety.
2. According study JAMA even one unlucky like 1% guys got myocarditis vaccine looking median 3.5 days would even appear.
3. Source JAMA guess autoimmune conditions (as evidenced donation link rheumatoid arthritis foundation article) vaccine result typical antibody response her. autoimmune conditions already recommended get booster shot…they, along subsets population, less likely make adequate antibodies vaccine. sad. sometimes access sites via google let in. google ""nytimes covid world tracker"" click result actually live RI good, vax #s need be, C+s pretty high, govs RI/MA shying away mandates proof vax like places. mask + here, voluntary bizs.  You’re never eating again?   Yeah biggest take-away.

Anyone wealth 1200 apartment units way much wealth. shows bad wealth disparity gotten.

2000 years ago king would wealth.  way view world vacation tracker posted without making newyork times account? charter? work LAUSD huge high school way 2 cases far. Yes, neither available us easily inexpensively. chose I’d choose inexpensive home test help determine current infections. antibody tests there’s even get free antibody test live—you pay it.   read two interesting things flu last year. 1. 30% cases asymptomatic 2. time you’re 30 there’s 98% chance you’ve flu. depending age, there’s extremely high probability you’ve known it. I’m 32 unaware ever it, almost certainly have. Fwiw I’ve gotten flu shot every year least last 12.

Just interesting tidbits thought I’d share we’re subject. regionalized - believe rural areas higher rates, larger metropolitan areas better shape. Given population disparity, overall California good shape, definitely pockets worry 

My county (Contra Costa - Bay Area) high rates vaccination case rate steadily trending since mid August - [CCC Covid  There's great statewide view [the LA too. get pretty regularly, well covid. generally symptom allergies last couple days. Good news makes water kinda taste like scotch that. called phantosmia. would get Covid test safe studies show symptom 6% folks. district mask mandate (that admin back teachers enforcing). superintendent decided masks save us all.

The part can't make work that, since Alaska 3.5 hour flight nearest ""neighboring"" state, hospitals begin ration care means medical catastrophes, there's relief valve. I'm similar thoughts, question is, long one keep avoiding without becoming 'bubble boy' Seinfeld, next 20 years... Unlikely. Due way SARS-Cov-2 infects body cells affected. Hmmmm makes curious many went UK get vaccinated blocked traveling. Yes, hard eat restaurant wearing mask. One get though, mask goes on. 80% people SF vaccinated. We're going live like March 2020, people taking precautions. obviously happen Florida, like entire country ignoring covid. Ah, yeah.

I know quite people mindset days.

There's skepticism, there's defeatism. cruel defeatism. Yep, thanks. misread comment. There's `,` missing ""workers"". almost certainly did. Russia developed Sputnik Vaccine, adenovirus vector vaccine, similar Oxford- Astra Zenica one. [It reasonably although initial data Russia signs obvious falsification. can't produce fast need it, Russia covid vaccine. course, Putin pals vaccinated whatever doctor thought effective, buy open market, pharmaceuticals never subject sanctions. would probably use one mRNA vaccines.

Infection still possible, vaccine. Serious complications unlikely, probably fine. 25% huge number. Healthy fit friend mine caught working nurse passed away within 1 month. 25 years old. understand parts US fine?  Maybe? talk make dose smaller could give doses. numbers likely high, think there'll winter wave big divergence states measures without. now.  shady? flu shot protection pretty mediocre comparison covid vaccines, ranging 20% worst years 60% best. 

I've gotten sporadically, like twice 10 years, I've never caught flu far know. Good. Medical workers believer medicine. That's fucked. really interesting. joke Sputnik lower effectiveness vaccines.

You think allegedly rich man world get best vaccine available? It’s pretty clear don’t believe people accept consequences actions. They’re free choose selfish pricks. don’t like consequences choosing selfish pricks, sounds didn’t really think then, huh. de nuevo decía... see charts. pages say “confidential.” saying you’re wrong, sayin “Which isnt”

Yes, is. actually done research topic Catholic Church?

So what, “believe angels, spirts, talking snakes, awesome power praying Jewish zombie super being”?

“So goes point right there”

How?

Having Big Bang Evolution doesn’t disprove stuff? could it?

Your arguments shallow doesn’t accomplish think does. wife pregnant, we're isolating next week gets vaccine. wait 14 weeks supposedly. 


It's tough, love outdoors. love wife child-to-be much more.   it

No, I'm insinuating. Church believes driving 10 speed limit tell cop pulling worry, I'm practicing faith? people literally martyrs lie. oddly, millions anti-vaccine Americans, martyrs reinforce beliefs. 

The absolute intellectual denial truth regarding science toxic brew continue kill, Covid, many instances science politicized 'For quite time' equal now. talking back April May yea, see that. almost 3.5 billion people worldwide vaccinated. think enough data now, yet 75% pregnant women still unvaccinated. yes, intelligence issue. already boosters? got mine (moderna booster) last week hit like wall bricks, idea full half dose though. don’t think pregnant women getting vaccinated ‘apply all’ scenario. Every situation different.

Yeah, wrong one. vaccine literally harm, turn gives wife baby 10x 27x better chances safe. would watched that

Are ex? One curious side effects *protecting COVID* (from 2020), influenza cases sharply last year. CDC believes caused mask wearing. public figures see hypocrisy. see *leverage.* Tell entire SUNY SYSTEM messaging I've heard even critical pregnant women get vaccinated...  That’s sad. don’t agree beliefs, respect them. And, giving people planet, seen. Barn raising thing crazily well.  Yo get therapist atleast friend/family member talk asap ones ""agree"" typically cars, phones, computers, degrees. 

Jehovah Witnesses ones wacky allowance lets everything DNA dervied items including blood transfusions etc. they've ALWAYS it.  minors infected COVID19 lack complete understanding long Covid doesn’t nullify import concern invalidate it’s factoring risk. enough concrete pieces signal data render legitimate concern. “Disabled” high bar, “tangibly reduced function and/or quality life” need disability, especially since might avoidable, we’re debating deploying effective measure prevent it, boosters. 

Beyond that: Hospitalization death protection slipping. “mild” breakthroughs still life-disrupting illnesses, often “anything doesn’t land hospital”. still lack effective accessible treatment early disease. weigh fact you’re basically guaranteed get Covid given level spread contagiousness. skate flu season without getting flu due sheer luck; isn’t case Covid. *will* exposed get lacking enough protection. want protection less protection?

It’s reasonable want avoid Covid point, we’re point getting Covid routine part person’s year. think title book written disgraced former senator Stuart Smalley ;) Great, they're still easy find expensive compared types masks. perfect world? Sure. people best economic options kn95s surgical masks, double masking. Spoiler alert: yes he’s antivaxer. Several 30-40 year old Moms know Calgary getting bombarded misinformation mom facebook groups. fucked up, issue worldwide nobody talking it. Zuckerberg got scott free society destabilizing idiots subject foreign propaganda. hand, anti-vaxx sentiment Russia. There's guarantee even Putin's inner circle fully vaccinated.  care reducing risk symptomatic disease transmitting COVID-19 others even supposed experts like Dr. Chin-Hong ""don't care.""

They're expert, you. believe opinion important theirs? Pregnant people? I'd go. suspended?

Seems weird haven’t mass firings yet.  government Canada precisely concerned about?

They'll *definitely* stop using technology pandemic deemed over. *No chance* new power abused.

/s, obviously. It’ll much higher end. Even Delta hit seeing sickest patients I’ve ever seen ICU, Covid hit that’s now. folks still dying, probably home.  according you, 97% uptake rate ""deathly afraid Covid"", 70% uptake rate (with 30% taking rumors circulating swollen balls) ""getting good grip""?

Now stampede vaccines people cutting line sabotaging others get vaccine themselves, I'd believe ""deathly afraid Covid"" thing see that. Lovely see!   pious

Speaking piety, God would plead folks get vaccinated follow public health mandates benefit themselves, spouse, God-fearing Christian family, community. 

*Get yer dang shots, love God!*  Vaccinated though?

Early discussions first vaccine sounding pretty horrible, lots side effects poor results

I take everything officially reported China container ship salt, propaganda machine working overtime days abrahamitic religion doesn’t allow foreign objcets body masterfully crafted god….

Most people don’t interpret way anymore, still. girl's gotta earn enough money 5 years eat rest life.  co-congregants, Q.  Another thing keep night 🥺 good know though! wish were, it’s literally right. power would be. Lucky power, don’t even know what’s going on. visiting grandparents going clubs safely world primarily using vaccination.

We since long *before* vaccines. July 2020 first post-covid music festival Perth, iirc. rest world looking *mighty* dystopian there, particularly winter followed.

And yes, slow vaccines. Outside worst-hit Western nations, they're still relatively scarce around world, ""around world"" mostly referring them. Fortunately, changing relatively quickly, end next month pretty much there, looking begrudgingly adopt ""living covid"" everyone else already forced to.  Reading article like living Stone Age. Let’s pray [Apparently people practicing religions hand back cars, mobile phones, computers degrees please leave job requires kind scientific progress cavorting devil every time so. 

I simply want retain purity soul.  main problem lot people around world vaccinated sputnik. Argentina, around 10 million first doses vaccine administered. happens people want travel abroad? big issue.   saw people campaigning vaccinations teenagers yesterday whilst driving. upset daughter and, turning windows shouting them, introduced new words. Lying scum are.  Umm entire country......just thought Ebola African disease well...I could go won't.    It’s intelligence issue. quite time enough data vaccination pregnancy. wife pregnant, doctor told wait get shot. Also, pregnancy extremely vulnerable time (obviously). don’t think women necessarily “antivax” like others avoid shot. isn’t attempt excuse btw, explain Funny mention that… happened visiting family town got sick. moved new house built. everyone worried faulty wiring. made coffee tasted HORRIBLE realized might something going physically. taste gone part, things could taste, tasted like chemical burn smell steroids. still high risk nowadays, since bottom maternal mortality. about, know, concept evidence-based medicine generally.   honestly don’t understand you’re saying. Another commenter said original comment suggesting women CHOOSE babies bad decision, didn’t read way all. sounds like “having baby right sucks” true maybe I’m literal sometimes Exactly, ""Severe disease death"" thing I'm concerned I'm frustrated FDA acting like that's case. kids 12 high risk family members. want vector would give disease booster helps reduce chance matters me. Even officially say everyone needs go get booster I'm frustrated seem heading towards even allowing get one.  look bottom page, says ""Pfizer Confidential"" Lol housing isn’t human right? Thank god you’re power AAP publishes figures. looked month last time checked 1:20 cases needing hospitalization. figure seemed high could selection error since many parents getting kids tested unless symptoms bad. serious agenda right scientific community align stop anyone boosting rest world catches up. perfect world literally every unused shot ends arm person developing world, see real argument. However yet see anyone credible state even real possibility. likely scenario Biden right, capacity both. far easier administer shots locally logistics involved getting developing world. agree. People way obsessed “mask vs mask” result, old people waltzing grocery stores shitty masks hap hazardly strewn across face. Since population vastly smaller, think we’re good most. Sadly year even higher. mother still hasn’t gotten vaccinated. don’t get it.


Took weeks month cajoling haranguing get mother get shots. give up.   immune system period-accurate Jesus' time. mighty Roman army foot, horseback chariots. comes covid dive bombers tanks. really. bashing Russia always gets upvotes great job! organized religion recognized US Canada vaccines.. sub sects organized religions recognized religions fk attempts science denial people get first vaccine priority 

I keep hearing this, even people FDA confuses hell me. false choice. There's shortage vaccines USA anybody first shot point can't find appointment. There's reason act like thing even needs considered. I'm favour boosters. However, understand scientific desire get people planet initial dosing reduce chances another variant mutating evades vaccines effectively delta. 

It's tough. want booster maximize personal safety delta. remember last spring feeling like things would back normal fall, dismissing possibility dangerous variant. want make mistake again. 

I willing admit despite following news closely reading plenty abstracts scientific studies, university degree science, equipped judge risks another variant developing causing yet another even destructive global wave infections. Therefore accept whatever scientific, economic, ultimately political consensus emerges, knowing messy prone reversals new data gathered. 

Authorities always get things right, tend better lay people time. I'm generally favour scapegoating authority seem mistaken, times crisis like these, feel unity behind informed authority important, sake social cohesion. need look antivaxers see happens easily discard trust authority crisis. easy remember times authorities slow come us obvious conclusion. often forget times thought obvious conclusion ended completely wrong. Therefore I'm going restrain calling immediate boosters all, even though sense would benefit moment. No. Realtors sell unvaxxed.  demonizing lionizing specific disease, impact healthcare system. 

1 10 people world chronic kidney disease, progress End-Stage Renal Failure need dialysis. inevitability we'll significant load dialysis patients healthcare system one time. 

As much I'd like people get vaccine relieve load, since won't, I'd treat like inevitable load. offload majority like ESRF. I’m pro vaccine mandates get I’m evicting people. Pushing people street bit much me.   hurt try sound authoritative fucking clue talking about? Exactly. I'm hoping businesses start this. vax? Sorry, find bank services unvaxxed. vax? Sorry, find internet service provider services unvaxxed. Et cetera. Anecdotally walking swimming helped neuropathy, lung capacity, brain fog. careful overdo it. Idaho annouced triage system today, whelmed unvaccinated covid cases, unable handle non-covid emergencys. good, rome burns. Well go! sure faired. one things actively seek information on. 

Thanks kind sir! Glad hear friend able get something helped. recall drugs put on? Well States full fuds ran fuds expect? hope thinks extra healthy thoughts next weeks think, wish everyone else best - one forced suffer rationed healthcare. Maybe mix thinking better odds getting hired.  get pass actual belief. protected protected. 

The groups taking hospital beds impacting others STAND beliefs. Aka use science. HENCE hypocritical. crazy belief actually believe practice it.*

*However, HUGE argument made people communities get choice, namely kids 13 victims. that's talking about. I’m sure glad live country pre-existing conditions zero relation healthcare. profit health insurance crime.  still don’t fundamentally understand booster program greater push worldwide vaccination home winning hearts minds mutually exclusive

Because supply still limited worldwide. soon US approves booster everyone elegible, Pfizer going focus providing US doses, limiting amount exported countries. Argentina supposed getting 20 million doses Pfizer end year. highly doubt get doses timeline widespread booster program first world countries like US UK certainly going push timeline much much further. Nevertheless, I'm booster elderly inmuno-compromised. need extra protection right now, healthy adults 30s don't. aware. rephrase: CDC guidance intended situations cannot say certainty literally everyone vaccinated.

With vaccine passport system (with allowance unvaccinated people w/ negative test result), unreasonable fully vaccinated people go unmasked indoors, even level community transmission high.   good- figured auto correct head could make case dolly like supply chain carrier something.  really idea depth illness. Every person severe cfs tell impossible person experienced type suffering understand. simply idea reference point.

Do know severe cfs ill talk? Therapy doesn’t work us.

Many go years, decades without seeing sunlight, without touching talking another soul. Without movement, reading, sound, music, reading. idea. None. tiktok trend people profile anti-vaxxers, pulling anti-vax social media posts, videos idiots stores (like old woman Zoro mask tried go store saying sufficient), following died Covid. 

Gotta say, hate it. hope though serve deterrent others (probably not), least entertaining. bother assume make shit Almost everyone take unless history anaphylactic reactions vaccines experienced something like Guillain-Barr syndrome. 

That’s it, afaik.

That said, people like autoimmune disease immunosuppressive treatments (or cancer patients undergoing chemo, example) may advised “postpone” vaccinations immune systems recovered immunosuppressive therapy. Meaning told wait ~6 months get first vax. longest. Wait. Ever. 

But I’m getting third Pfizer shot tomorrow!!!  Thanks it’s beyond ridiculous thankfully daughter well!! feel friends kids stop treatment cancer f’ing aggressive. hope right Michigan seeing counts again. Praying data comes back good vaccine kids vaccinated. We’ve locked since 9 months old. Poor girl doesn’t know she’s missing on. risk averse, yes worry dog attacks. guard dog kids allowed yard without her, primarily reason. happen live farm heart Michigan's best deer hunting, kids allowed yard breeding season starts. 

Your apples oranges comparison nonsensical. Delta emerging threat unknown potential, trying compare historical annual incident data. think clever comeback, yes, realize unknown potential means could bad worry could be. change god damned thing. Get kids vaccine, sensible reason tempt fate. already done. psychology fascinating. surprisingly large segment society distrustful authority medical/scientific establishment refuse whatever authority recommends. find something else feed subversive ""we know real truth"" world view.

They're awfully similar rebellious children refuse they're parents tell parents told it. Suffering level like normal suffering.

No? Brain adapt damage cannot regenerate like say skin. cells basically going get.  Great idea, doubt he'll take certainly offer!  basic tenet modern American Evangelical movement nutshell Bitcoin safe answer. 

If disagree, misinformed. took college courses high school, get permission teachers classes miss classes conflicted - reason non college prep teachers willing miss class attend college course.

I guarantee tracks get kind education. Honors College Prep taught things standard vocational aren't. Restaurant rules theater anyway. purpose keep restaurants business. Masks work, work they're worn, sitting hour room full people also wearing masks, chewing talking loudly, makes zero sense. thing could make eating restaurant reasonably safe everyone restaurant vaccinated, case, might well dump hygiene theater rules. chance could come live while? would hate put position, would first offer family room, bed, food, love. Context number pre-existing conditions died painful death 2020. open world. do, see efficacious vaccines really studies peer reviewed. Cuba surprised us past, health community great reputation small pretty poor country, hopefully results legit.  hope too, thanks may line unvaccinated friends, possible could given well? know want blame single person transmission. thinking maybe countries bit hasty, know right? pretty much impossible answer question dynamic nature disease exposure spread, ask similar one. much likely someone unvaccinated die COVID vaccinated person? answer roughly 11x. (10x likely hospitalized.)

So watched equally sized groups vaccinated unvaccinated people equal exposure period time 100 vaccinated people died, expect something like 9 vaccinated deaths. Unvaccinated nurses caused huge problems area Florida...because they've catching Covid. case pandemic. want see Covid+ nurse ER, matter PPE?


Hospitals right hold line. confronting problem created peddlers misinformation.


I would grant exemptions people prior infections still strong antibody levels, otherwise, require shot.


Also, we'll see month without pay impacts this, many get shot come back.  assume don’t live area lots Amish — cause damn sure interact (endanger) rest society. 

They run stores markets, shop grocery stores do, hire non-amish drivers need get places buggy can’t go...

Blah. happening Washington better, IMO. Employers (generally) accept exemptions based religion, that's one step process. still able accommodate exemption. 

That means allowed go day normal. healthcare settings they're mandatory daily/weekly tests wear what's called ""papr"" super-inconvenient-to-wear respirator. look like accommodation must reasonable anti-vaxxer, also employer. instance wearing papr reasonable jobs outside healthcare. Washington State Patrol instance made blanket statement public facing roles accommodations. way reduce increased potential exposure unvaccinated patrolmen/women public large without removing public facing roll entirely there's nowhere else put them.

This seems best way allow religious exemptions cases person truly holds belief, time keeping public safe business free potential liability.  “That’s higher think people would expect,” said Dr. James Antoon, Assistant Professor Pediatrics Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital Vanderbilt.

I dunno, feel like fact 21% children COVID case severe enough put hospital also case severe enough require ICU care fairly line expectations. 
 
If turned 21% children catch COVID end hospitalized, *that* would much expect. that's saying. Okay. person finds pregnant. live Texas. want pregnant baby all. cannot get abortion laws currently place. must baby. Someone says “There’s pandemic, right time baby.” think feel that? Completely agree. like FDA news morning saying need give boosters need giving first shots. things mutually exclusive! enough doses available both! super frustrating. like ok arbitrary number people getting dosed ok people's arbitrary standards.

Cool, thank you. Why? OB docs different ICU docs. run risk ICU bed complications riskier normal. Thank you, angelicpussy. Haha. sn gave good laugh worry plenty plenty plenty voted alone thoroughly bothered personal decision actually affect anyone else. agree. Relgious exemption valid excuse vaccinated. choose get vaccinated also live consequences. mandates coming new governor, hope NY join short list soon. Yep. favor interpretation separation church state as: state endorse religion, state attack religion. Basically, religion invisible government.

Instead, religious people made rules 200 years, perks special treatment religious people. Churches pay taxes like everyone else. 
 Religious folk get delete facts like every child's textbooks. Religious workers get holidays Sundays worship coworkers cover shifts. And, now, religious people get put family danger purposefully becoming disease vectors.

I mean, could lot worse, like we're Saudi Arabia anything, popular interpretation separation church state being, ""Religious people want government can't tell otherwise"" bunk. filling Oregon hospitals well. 

Thanks Idaho!

In general don’t understand anything technology way younger people do. infected children wind ICU.""

Let's explore statement.

Check American Academy Pediatrics reports states reporting, children ranged 1.6%-4.1% total cumulated hospitalizations, **0.1%-1.9% child COVID-19 cases resulted hospitalization.**""

Let's call ""0.1-1.9%"" range 1% simplicity. title article OP 21% hospitalized kids end ICU. 1% kids test positive end hospitalized (per AAP data), 21% end ICU, would mean 0.2% kids test positive end ICU.

Where 4.2% coming from? see JHM Study linked article:

""Among 19,976 COVID-19 encounters, 15,913 (79.7%) patients discharged emergency department (ED) 4063 (20.3%) hospitalized.""

So assume taking 20.3%, multiplying 21% headline, get 4.2%. However, think 20.3% saying 20.3% **of infections** result hospitalization. looks like saying 20.3% people came hospital admitted. 79.7% ""were discharged emergency department."" Presumably relatively small fraction infected people go emergency department all.

Right? think AAP provides sound transparent data, fact AAP says 1% kids positive tests ends hospitalized difficult square assertion ""4.2% infected children wind ICU."" describe above, think accurate number probably 0.2% kids test positive end ICU.

Thoughts? trying start fight. trying make sure accurate numbers posted. I'm open correction. headline Ireland Sweden Uh, want take vaccines? believe free speech human right. Even person saying complete bullshit believe them. Silencing people things believe cause chaos destruction. believe Facebook science.   Seeing weirdly put mind *A Christmas Carol*.

Yeah I’m pretty sure we’re keeping inside house stair gate moves out.  No, OK get vaccinated pregnant. MD advise get vaccinated.

It needs made clear EVERYONE get damned vaccine already. Still figuring out: Northern Maine says hello. not. norm wear symptoms something flu season/there's bug going around. routinely wear indoor settings year round. wear mask to. it’s required, won’t anymore. It’s *implication* dad fell last week &amp; broke hip, three places arm. LAST place wanted anywhere near hospital sub acute care facility, are. 

I currently cannot even visit sub acute care facility Covid positive patient in-house. They’re locked down. 

This fucking nightmare. lease he’s vaccinated. need that, whether immunocompromised honor system. vast majority even asking, vast majority rest requiring proof whatsoever.

That way get card, eventually 'fully vaccinated' going mean 3 shots. Lmao yes exactly Lots people reason care much 9 months ago vaccines first available disease clear risk profile, people low risk categories much worry about. vaccines start mandated people reason care vaccinated even miniscule risk virus, certainly inspire people look questions vaccine. 
Remember, receptors respiratory tract virus enters body. virus killed mouth throat nose, may reduce dose virus person receives therefore give immune system chance fight virus (before potentially becoming overwhelmed virus) body would initially presented fewer viral particles. 

Plus, thought reducing viral load mouth, nose throat, reduce viral load overall potentially reduce severity symptoms, also reduces risk onwards transmission fewer Covid virions may expelled mouth nose. 

It also thought reducing viral load mouth throat nose reduce risk virus creeping lower respiratory tract causing pneumonia. 

Unfortunately, anti vaxxers caught onto something potentially therapeutic effects. way going may risk heart thyroid issues iodine overdose, may catch Covid anyway vaccine best protection. no.. not. 

And provinces doubled ICU capacities reducing surgeries moving beds treat covid-patients... First time (before vax) lost sense smell taste immediately called job (it sunday). quarantined house away family. Monday drove 45 min rapid drive test. Tested pos. whole family tested afternoon (2 day test). stayed quarantined. son tested pos rest neg. son moved quarantine. Wife daughter tested every 3 days. Never positive. 

Second time (after vax) woke nose crusty throat dry. rarely ever get sick odd. called work. wife drove cvs bought two home test kits. quarantined separate part house. tested positive. Tested wife kids tested negative. tested day test pos again. Stayed quarantined tested every two days cvs home tests. No, they're right. better point, likely reaches level longer helps. Trouble is, know exactly level is.

IMO, big question side effects. worse ones doses 3+ 1-2, lot downside, potentially better protection.... I'd rather err side extra antibodies rather enough. it? people people? want admit wrong it, act juvenile. That's triage works far kidney stones go. painful, life threatening. Even life threatening ailments, ER focuses treating immediate danger first. Serious issues going immediately kill permanently disable someone get lower priority. heat viral bacterial pneumonia? Wish workplace mandated vaccines too. Short dying, still suffer permanent heart damage delayed treatment. Agreed!! Anti-vaxxers back line! province 1.4 million people, ICU care normally required many people even disasters.  weather events outside rare tornados, severe thunderstorms lead casualties.  much excess ICU capacity staffing costs alot money us citizens paying high insurance premiums co-pays network costs.  different way looking healthcare/emergency services canada 3 year boost life expectancy us suggesting healthcare system/way perhaps equal better US.  nurses doctors know vaccinated. hugely important piece info them. happy got vaccine sympathetic helpful fact ended someone suffer it.

At moment it’s hard get since country closed borders international arrivals back March 2020 keep covid out. talking opening get 80% double dose nationally (we’re currently track reach around November). 

Some states/territories bad covid outbreaks 3 8 currently tough moment ramp vaccination rates (Eg VIC currently 400+ cases per day NSW 1,200+ cases per day), 5 states pretty much covid-free. case contact tracing good find contacts people 14 days home quarantine rest population goes per usual (although currently wear masks indoors case get outbreak). 

We heading summer that’s also good timing us. 

The great thing don’t government leaders trying totally undermine health advice. advocate masks, vaccination, etc. main political issues equitable vaccine distribution states wanting keep borders closed states outbreaks longer 80% double dose national plan (because covid want make sure everyone vaccinate first). 

No country dealt covid perfectly literally nowhere else I’d prefer right now.   entire job landlord extracting money others, contribute anything. also way many rights. jurisdictions landlord renewing lease means owe 4 figures money. doubt that's case one sadly would nice actually defined rural urban.

They appear relying *exclusively* numbers averaged several months including months delta 5-6 month dropoff early vaccinated.

Or, they're saying 73-90% severe disease justify boosters even elderly. CDC study saying 80%? Observational, observation data useless, especially confirming opinion.

Either way, we're shit. FDA seems already made mind nonmedical reasons torch credibility. Yes! city sub really starting grate me. positive article cases going down? “WHO CARES SHOUKD LOCK DECEMBER”

Maybe angry *and motivated*. might hospital, might start randomly dropping anti-vaxxers. :-(  Unfortunately virus seem open negotiation. Got back! FWIW also eating food restaurants, whether it’s take-out, dine-in patio. see many people working restaurants news segments masks half chins. wait long necessary. I’m sensitive one gets instantly sick horrible cramps diarrhea slightest thing went wrong food storage, preparation and/or handling. Many tasty restaurant meal ruined unsanitary conditions (and def food allergies). Typically, used run clinics military exercises. Now, I'm sure Surely it’s past time lift restrictions vaccinated. DeSantis Abbott get huge credit trying ""beat"" them, though.    concerned swollen testicle come suck sick.

That's said I'd make easy you: Moderna. slow certain, certainty makes feel good recommending stranger. Go it, ASAP.

And long-term repercussions vaccination. side-effects resolved within couple months. Covid far threatening long-term. Sanctity Wedge Issues Interesting. NY put cause death certificates (at least decade 2). Privacy issues, believe. 

The reason know dad's death listed ""old age"" passed home witness initial paperwork filled out. official certificates nothing listed. SO's parent passed 15 years ago, nothing listed there, either.

Sorry crazy SIL... That's pretty topic. one said anything never dying here.

Lots people die without dieing illness. Besides would want get sick experience misery couple times year avoid simple shot arm?

There people working anti-aging life extension. Mostly private companies. interesting stuff. knows, maybe reach goal defeating death one day. I'm gonna claim see future. real…. exhausting. Plague? never get medical advice non medical personnel. absolutely judge people decisions get people killed. whole lot people going find there's major difference claiming religious exemption proving court religion always taught vaccinations devil. Yeah seems like likely scenario quit waffling it. vaccine tested released much quicker normal could brought try give people protection it, open country prevent economic damage. 

Now data testing available, probably going determined shots spaced probably need 3 shots maximum effectiveness. would almost strange considering DTaP Pneumococcal conjugate 4 shot series, IPV, HiB, HepB, Rotavirus typically 3 shot series. less like HepA VZV require one shot, MMR require 2 shots, majority require least 3 spaced Pfizer/Moderna's 1st 2nd shots were.  Gotta get healthy first.

Seriously though, would declare bankruptcy go life past bankruptcy. Totally normal USA stuff. vaccines protect kind severe infection permanently damages lungs. J&amp;J little less effective

What ""a little less effective"" mean? evidence mrna vaccines offer substantially protection serious disease single shot Janssen vaccine growing compelling.

For example, [this peer reviewed VISION network study New England Journal effectiveness full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (≥14 days second dose) 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87 91) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 86 93) infection leading ICU admission, 91% (95% CI, 89 93) infection leading emergency department urgent care clinic visit

And Janssen (no calculations ICU admission fewer people got effectiveness Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 68% (95% CI, 50 79) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading hospitalization 73% (95% CI, 59 82) infection leading emergency department urgent care clinic visit.

~90% efficacy vs ~70% efficacy quite lot, would mean Jannsen vaccine recipients ~3X likely hospitalized breakthrough case.   keep hearing restrictions public safety. spread stopped area? waited like 5 hours extreme pain ER back March even think hospital *that* busy. I'm lucky burst. wonder family press charges hospital Oh see, sorry! Yes, sounds great. Thanks Ok makes much sense. Thanks!

Edit: important thing note population density also seems play insignificant factor. Still glad see something representative take cluster fuck early-mid 2020 was. idiots threaten hospital lawsuits...and, unfortunately, probably win.

There type waiver refuse vaccinate. One protects hospitals physicians lawsuits hold patient responsible idiotic decisions. surprise. People like see karmic justice.

Bizarre What's number Pfizer? found data 6 months (84%): case catholics...the pope said take vaccine... data Pfizer claimed vaccine efficacy decline much time? want vaccine required interact mine. think absurd online schooling instead them, they're scared simple requirement school.

And agree that. Right now, however, vaccine approved children ages 5 11 - encompasses children. Combined eligible people choice getting vaccine not, I'm comfortable exposing kids that. people are. way change mind enough die publicly visible fashion possible. Hence desire spread videos.

I disagree. way change mind make see evidence eyes, experience pain exhaustion misery strongly possible. Take tour ICU every hospital 30-mile radius. would trick number them, think. think also glossing important HOWs here. people get lead astray? made fertile targets charlatans? makes attack things like mask mandates, scary.. inconvenient.

How led astray? bit's simple. Conservative media, misinformation campaigns. We've known ages. 

What made fertile targets charlatans? Life, basically. lifetime little frustrations, life changing frequently (30 years ago computers every home, 20 cell phones becoming thing, 10 years ago economic crisis, etc.). given reason frustrations, outlet vent upon, enemy go against, well, conservative media captured them. set this. moment, fact necessarily think masks great deal either, wear anyway helps others little worth it. could wrong. cost anything minor annoyance annoyance worth bit help might give.

I same, masks shown help prevent spreading. inconvenience, that. understand people protest them, think see first step towards controlling individual freedoms, see possibly making children's immune systems weaker, exposing usual gamut germs viruses they're expected grow with.

All disease - - believe big deal, they've convinced ""experts"". 

While element selfishness many people, many others trying wade muddy waters, guided someone claims best interest mind.  don’t see happening. think insurance company lobby/lawmakers dared try that, would mass uproar. Hope gets  Same. Pfizer February hey mate get second experience same? often advocate universal healthcare. Thanks understanding importance. think lot people going begging covid hospital bills sent survivors estates unfortunately pass siphoned. Cheers. chance much yet I'm starting look forward voting her. Thanks sone avails us. doesn’t surprise deaths disconnected. thing government action actually control us case rate. Deaths think determined variety factors. Like… I’m Michigan. cases-per-capita average, death rate it. I’d also imagine extreme difference likely increase time well tools governments use.

That said, statistically could coincidence right? could high taxes low case rates result thing. Even issue preventing severe illness, that's waned too, that's bigger problem. 

The largest CDC study issue showed effectiveness severe disease dropped 87% overall, 80% seniors. least 4 *US based* studies data trackers gotten numbers ranging -13 +3 that.

The FDA made mind non-medical reasons, know reasons bullshit, calling ""observational data"". ""observational data"" plan listen studies hand running averages. cited 23 page letter. ""very high"" summer... in, May+June+July... May June delta, early vaccinated reached 5-6 months. 

They're completely torch credibility heavily distorting extent strength dropoff severe disease. They're going straight lie going validate everything antivaxxers ivermectin freaks say trusting them, time fringe lunatics calling out, everyone able read evidence know they're lying deliberately screwing seniors 6+ months 2 week speedup fast add hundreds millions doses we're exporting.  Key word “at point.” note didn’t say “hide indoors there’s zero Covid.” talking striving highest possible level protection.

We might find matter much boosting breakthrough infections always come back suck still lose taste smell brain fog etc. case yea, we’re gonna end eventually.

It also might case booster immunity lasts long time aggressively reduces severity breakthrough cases happen eliminates lasting sequela. Seems like good payoff me, you’re willing wait booster. worked healthcare previously (mental health, still healthcare) sheer number nurses working inpatient clients refused get vaccinated still boggles mind. Hell, one woman worked recently got shot current employer requires plus family member test positive. Full recovery, enough scare her.

But hey, least actually got vaccine instead continuing decline it. sounds exactly like positive test week ago. hope symptoms linger also deal covid, guess somewhat grateful. Breakthroughs delta appear occurring overwhelming viral load. Simply able reduce amount virus encountered might help body fight rest. Many back now. That's source says official government

but maybe good idea look stats 1 day number people (it supposed example shows booster works, calculate percentages)

the total number people serious illness got booster age 60 Israel 10, big number. That’s awful :/ tone name-calling? start with, they're going asked they've ever taken vaccination modern medical treatment. jumping comment.

It's matter different strokes different folks. example, I'm naturally homebody. prefer eating takeout cooking rather going restaurant. like watching movies home like subtitles miss crucial details (and last time went theater, someone sitting explaining whole damn movie date). Sports games better views TV even best seats, spend hour leaving parking garage after. digital age makes easier enjoy culture home.

That said, I'll definitely go back attending concerts watching performances person. I'll masked really, really hate sick. also really rocking masks.  Thanks! know found otters too. interesting.   Fear. anti vax movement started denounced researcher presented disproven study linking vaccines autism. what? 10,15 years ago? 

So people read articles Facebook saw shit Fox News study done researcher “proving” vaccines cause autism. study quickly proven wrong yet mis disinformation continued spread mutated time sorts stupid shit like vaccines micro chips idek else.

So it’s mix ignorance fear. ignorant cross reference dig study studies afraid children getting illness that’s become lot prevalent lately(or least traceable). No. It’s poor thought compare contagious illness individual health decisions.

Cars parked grass ambulance parking spots ER overcrowded. visitors allowed. helpless I’ve ever felt. far, covid symptoms. stayed masked obviously vaccinated. That's ridiculous dangerous decision.

These people allowed work directly patients undergo routine test often.

One's religious beliefs justify endangering countless people deadly virus.

If serious religion, seek another profession Masks optional Ohio schools lower vaccination rate Florida. Ohio also weren’t hit hard first wave governor locked things down. feeling Ohio going get bad.  

Dr Columbia recent AMA sub says doesn’t think boosters needed all.  GoFundMe, I’d gladly donate. Better money spent donating politicians point. Hmmm, wonder *which* half? government help protect health actions others. government believes individuals protecting themselves. government protected right bear arms so. go swimmingly.  person mistakes common sense good judgment fear? take dare something? 

Have heard long covid? seen stories overwhelmed hospitals, pregnant women dying, etc.? know anything factual Covid? 

So many questions. don’t run across anyone like day day life. happily vaccinated enjoying life. assign monetary value buy sell trade. I.e. decommodification. 

Are golden rings made thing? using like extremely strict financial legal definitions conceptual philosophical ones? gold bullion cost different amounts different stores different markets? tell type antibodies (natural immunity vaccine)? even possible do?

It depends vaccine.  various antibody tests look antibodies ""S"" ""N"" proteins.  ""S"" spike protein molecular grappling hook virus uses enter cells. ""N"" ""Nucleocapsid"" protein, part viral shell.  

For vaccines used US think Europe (Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazenica, J&amp;J/Janssen) possible distinguish natural immunity vaccine-only immunity.

Those vaccines expose immune system variant virus's spike protein part virus.

Most people natural immunity develop immunity spike parts virus (including ""N"" protein).

It likely possible reliably tell someone natural immunity also vaccinated. say post, read again... specific saying know information reliable... Reading comprehension man

And also, know FL numbers accurate, remember lady sued ? 1 500 people died covid. 

So math PhD say, average chances person died covid? article this? could headline news locally. Hmm, changed last months …  Thanks. expecting big changes. think .22/.24 good starting point analysis. :-) Yeah parents *should* lot things, don’t think it’s big ask put piece cloth mouth make sure little Tommy doesn’t lose grandma grandpa. 

That’s wear mask work anyway. Holy shit looked itbup convicted manslaughter. Jesus Christ hell find guy.  oby-gyn recommended vaccine 6 months pregnancy reason. last 5 years vortex chaotic elements mashed together. come kind stories reported last year? think mean sounds awful? could wrong. Also 8 months also work healthcare. want get booster dose bad trying wait officially approve it. don’t approve September 20th like white house said I’m gonna get it. shouldn’t I’m exposed daily? refuse social distance wear mask Education treat stupid. happens education gets defunded neglected many years. avoidable got booster shot 4 weeks ago. Pope pro-vaccine. interesting.

What they’re proving right use “religion” excuse anything. Like fake emotional support animals. suspect kids babies vaccinated policy lower restrictions become endemic. 

So wear mask months longer. Stop whining online. big deal. Interesting, wonder there’s way tell someone both? Sure, pretty known 5-7 months ago, big unknown OBs woefully unprepared talk It. practices recommend it, many gave mealy mouthed advice getting - “well, it’s you” kind stuff “it fine”, etc comments inspire confidence. Yup, that's way Geez...so anything happens one vaccinated fault vaccine? long cause effect situation last? Twisted ankle couple weeks getting vaxxed would love blame Pfizer instead clumsiness. [Antibodies alone determine effective Use VPN? makes sense. lot states highly dense area followed miles country. WA comes mind consider major cities west mountains east mountains small towns/mid sized cities lower vaccination rates objectively worse schools.

Data crazy. Many truths derived it, also many truths missed. Funny, work like that. First, vaccinated. comorbidities. Third, extremely fit. Fourth, young. Fewer 1,000 people died covid characteristics. 

I never called uneducated. guess 5 degrees including PhD count much days. Also interesting, PhD mathematics. Well “that something else” trying intimidate rape victim also failure ER triaging staff well covid. I've never heard hospital making child wait something serious even last year.

Golden rings commodity mean financial trading sense term. Anything assigned value also used considered commodity.

Okay, want 2nd definition, then, useful valuable thing, water time.

Water stop guarantee X gallons every citizen country.

So think housing commodity

Makes sense sense housing ALWAYS useful thing. wonder point post-2nd shot us moderna folks get booster. 8 month recommendation seems arbitrary  know people (morons) claim anti-vax non-political reasons.

The reason Dr Mercola. deserves extremely slow painful death soon possible. I'm curious actually prove. article mentions Catholic Baptist faiths. I'm religious scholar, would doubt there's scripture specifically vaccinations religious exemptions seemingly thing. hospital system would fine people vaccinated. shouldn’t deal willful spread contagious illness. religion == bullshit. Personally would get whichever one convenient; got Moderna

they're convenient me, thankfully. need tell pharmacy one want. scheduling also issue health insurance check them, insurers preferred pharmacies. got mine Costco, free insurance provider. SO's insurance prefers CVS would $20 get Costco, free CVS logic AIDS never killed anyone, destroys immune system, something else kills sliced open finger work pretty bad last week went ER hour half. look bottom article linked, “Have experienced work hospital rationing care due COVID-19 overcrowding? Contact (removed name email cause don’t want directly post reddit.)” looked everywhere today. sold everywhere online too. state constitution binds federal judge, hearing federal claim, federal law exactly?

It's technicality full legal regime created Congress claims. pandemic, rural death rate equal slightly higher metropolitan death rate.

Which already insane - things equal - rural spread/death rate *should* much lower urban one account natural distancing space less mass transit/high pop. buildings. Behold libertarian paradise Churches. Put 100 people one room send eat restaurant family members houses. anti-vaxx anti-mask also tend religious.

It's huge part culture here. Meet somebody first question get ""what church go to?"" Lol us ""getting control"".

Pass hopium way. account states increasing rates like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Alaska? Idaho rationing care Washington doesn’t want take patients.

I didn’t see original source, don’t know. northern states school openings mask mandates going increase cases without question.  100% family family. initial slow rate wasn’t hesitantcy poor rollout Doubtful points know practical everywhere, areas one hospital, designate one C19 only.  Come folks.

It's complicated. One study necessarily enough demonstrate something unless high quality definitive. 

There lot studies show essentially identical performance Moderna Pfizer vaccines, couple show Moderna performing better.

Some experts suggested higher dose longer spacing Moderna could lead effective. think premature conclude based limited evidence. much bigger hospital bill doctors able operate appendix burst? 

Maybe antivaxers need start GoFundMe unnecessary medical costs they've generated others. kid started preschool last week. None kids masked, absolutely distancing (not much good anyway). I'm shocked cases yet limited options refuse COVID-19 vaccine, may hard time claiming exemption never protested dozen-plus vaccines Defense Department mandates troops, according new Army guidelines.

I like point ... already vaccine exemption, we'll see applies one first time ever said anything vaccines, shut fuck get jab.

That's true all. studies science say vaccines lower transmission rates, hospitalizations deaths. Look I'm trying give rational answers.

Abhorrent. selfish drains society literally killing people medical emergencies can’t get treatment. hate humanity. Well kid wasn’t vaccinated case would accomplish?  think opening mean removing restrictions. Basically, travel within EU open since June-ish, many countries still domestic restrictions face masks, social distancing, public gatherings/festivals etc. 

Denmark, however, restrictions all.  believe deaths far 52 53… there’s daily graphic comes press new cases, deaths, vaccinations etc.

Wow, 3 months! I’ve ever heard happening. PCR testing something else? would really suck, isolated three months… universal vaccine mandates without religious exemptions, unconstitutional Establishment Clause. Oops you’re right, think might replied wrong person. Haven’t fully woken yet haha, thanksfor pointing know dumb typo/autocorrect love idea covid patient heat lamp waiting hatch. thinking buying one things kindergarten since winter can't open windows much really know buy...any ideas?   Cuba developed covid-19 vaccine, two-shot regimen known Soberana 2 efficacy 91.2% booster called Soberana Plus, according studies country haven’t yet peer-reviewed. That's in. Usually forever maskers known ""live let live attitude."" live somewhere 80% residents vaccinated there's mask mandates forever maskers force wearing masks outside yelling anyone wear mask. I'm thinking majority people care ever go public without mask probably envisioning future deal ranting whenever come contact someone wearing mask.  Also, there's healthy wearing mask wherever public. rarely wear mask I'm definitely healthier time last year masking everywhere. 3rd slot card. crossed whatever default printed wrote ""3rd dose"" believe gp talking wild number nurses get vaccinated.. Mandates cause lack staff well. Less staff, less likely gonna able fit in. pretty small collective sacrifice prevent millions deaths even millions chronic ailments methinks. Reddit leans towards social extremely introverted (if even call behavior mindset introverted, think Reddit Redditors skew definition introversion shut-in avoiding sort social gatherings social behavior, inaccurate), hence comments like get upvoted extensively. 

It became pronounced lockdowns shutdowns comments like ""lockdowns easy, get stay home get avoid gatherings, what's love"" get highly upvoted posts state ""I enjoyed staying home lockdowns lot, me"" get lot responses replies mindsets. 

Let's say Reddit Redditors represent anywhere near significant scale people regarding taking measures seriously long haul. year since caught it, damage lack oxygen combined explains lot, much actually. Many us early survivors borrowed time, mostly know enough back then.

We encourage people get vaccinated, stay safe, keep masks actually gone. virus care age, health, anything else, bad, really bad.

My lungs scarred, head feels like always fog, headaches several times week since got it.  hit went husband’s face giving shit wearing mask.

People jackals. wear mask, risk getting assaulted terrorized go out.  awful. people psychopaths. point arguing then.  Yes, flu same. Obviously depends percentages. average, covid neither particularly severe extremely deadly.

And that's actually kind problem. issue covid deadly enough put strain healthcare system contexts high circulation, deadly enough perceived immediate threat vast majority population like say ebola rabies. Landlords provide housing. purchase housing sell temporary use markup profit. remotely same.

Every landlord making money people nothing.

How illegal force vaccination legal evict people based medical history? worry, help wearing masks MET Gala. understand 'for bit' mean anywhere several minutes months? implication suggest anywhere near former.

Just specific. people know took Pfizer symptoms besides sore arm hours. People took Moderna felt down, usually longer 1 day.  pope advantage able encourage vaccines masks Christian denominations least developed nations, particularly Evangelical ones, developed nations Catholics tend highly Educated, U.S. highest rates 4 year degrees among Christian denominations. People taken college level science courses likely understand support vaccines, also truly understand much th Bible symbolism, that's interpreted Aramaic, Latin, languages.

A lot people quote lot Bible verses remotely understand context history. part Chris using faith reason wear mask get vaccinated probably little understanding Bible acting opposite manner Jesus would. 

Same said constitution. obvious antimask/antivaxers little understanding construction. Fucking rights isnt. ZERO exemptions anyone unless doctor literally tells puts writing get jab could die health complications medically compromised one way another. children deserve die? popped existence snuffed out.    Oh yeah, masks always awesome biking! 👍 new area though, post-pandemic. hey Jim, KGB door? even make point note list exhaustive. Sept 2021! fucking April 2020 damn vaccine! Please tell beaverton.   Mostly Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna small group people Sinovac. Still single study whether aspirin helps outpatient covid. Or, matter, well-powered study anything might help outpatient covid. know shit ton anti-vax nurses doctors lost jobs data there. Anyone free analyze conclude might. Pfizer saying thing. Israel boosting last month. black box decision.   treat them. threat us.

Not. good. enough.

How much data need go over? running studies months. kids okay, let us parent sign waiver. best. Sign up! Anti vaxxers care pass dose go faster? Understandable, think people comfortable with. that’s wearing mask don’t to. good thing expect then. Lord going one hell gnat steers ass though. self serving admit freely. Cheers! ;) tell protection “severe disease” adequate want

Exactly. want protection infection disease loved ones, period. 

 paid vaccines. Unless make us sick work, FDA needs step aside. religion protected class. However, it’s going simple opting especially since religions said problem vaccine. cOviD pOiNt oNe peRceNt SuRvivAL rAtE!1 Yes, small chance allergic reaction vaccines. sit 15 minutes pharmacy leaving, going one, start showing symptoms anaphylactic shock time, respond. google symptoms prepare yourself.

J&amp;J chance specific kind dangerous blood clot send hospital, doctors know it, almost certainly survive. exceedingly rare; 1 150,000 women aged 18-49 side-effect. demographic groups, odds low, round zero. receiving vaccine, they'll hand fact sheet telling it. demographic group struggling anxiety, would go one mRNA vaccines.

Like said, though, really wrong decision here. correct. opposed dude? social situations enjoy friends. There’s reason humans keep activities around. Hmmmm doctors, scientists researchers decades experience field access data information. Nicki Minaj.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure believe. assure treat pts differently. 

We lose empathy criticize us vaccinated allow us help still come hospital. dozen people know regularly talk to, sore arm worst reaction. somebody serve dinner watch star war theater feel like cog machine? Bleak, dude. Alabama's motto ""Thank God Mississippi"".  Spreading deadly virus bad wouldn’t say “incredible”, problem, like countries.  Unemployment currently 17% leads crime, since island dependent tourism pandemics good tourism.

“In 2020, total number reported crimes Barbados stood 7,079 compared 7,660 previous year. 42 murders last year, compared 49 2019, one island's deadliest.” (Population Icy Hot inserted deep rectum (I doctor medical advice). Love landlord taking stand. know well law supports ability this? chance going end court? chose get vaccinated myself.     Seattle 18th populous city United States population 737,015 people. largest city could totally ""wiped out"" death count 788,900 people (because next largest city that). 

So look way excess death count alone enough wipe 18th populous city city town smaller Seattle care pick. 

Or hell, limit cities. lot nearly empty states. 788,900 deaths enough totally wipe out: Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota. biggest city states. whole state. That’s called endangering them. “But they’re endangered ways get endanger too” insane argument, kids deserve better. Best wishes you.

I’m sorry family member. Yeah mean wanna call technicality collapse means inability serve patient needs given resources. collapse also used humanitarian crisis governments ecological crises ensues. posted video link someone CNN speaking this. India Indonesia friends coworkers lost loved ones daily basis. would call humanitarian issue healthcare system can’t help masses anymore. Indonesia literally every unit aside icu emergency departments still operating。 I’m concerned sensationalization healthcare crisis versus addressing real issues like people refusing vaccines what’s causing pressure Alberta’s system government accountability keeping measures place. Eyes prize  issue evidence, FDA (or moderna/pfizer) phase 3 trials get any. Real world data useless here, since arent' giving boosters younger people get it. phase 1 data, overwhelmingly positive. 

So resolve this? Keep saying there's evidence forever? Yes obviously lmao. hell getting at. cop? know, part sadness around situation stories told. person person could access ICU *day* either. single hospital. believe high volume people likely suffered similar outcome ICUs capacity across Florida know fact data hand.  

If journalist respected news organization would like talk would open sharing story help increase awareness. confident openly approach press litigation. Washington lean on.  go get Pfizer moderna booster pharmacy? Unless/until reach herd immunity failsafe vaccine stands variants.....yeah, am.

Worse loved ones lost COVID people love long haul syndrome. Cardiac issues, kidney failure, brain fog. Unable work. 30's 40's.
Mask seems much better. covid = Unvaccinated = Antivaxer = Murderer = covid…..?  Friends!!! communism looks like. government taking care people....oh humanity could one live horrible place. Complete conjecture: remember right, Pfizer available Moderna, consequently authorized get vaccinated first December-February front line workers vulnerable populations (elderly and/immunocompromised). less risk populations became eligible vaccination, Moderna table well. Without seeing data (which could blow theory water) wonder fact alone could explain difference outcomes two mRNA vaccines. totally agree you, could see correlation/causation issue gets little fuzzy.

I live area CA 98% vaccination rate. wealthy we're high tax payers, think state government anything residents practicing safety getting vaccinated.

There likely many areas CA like this... wealthy, well educated health focused seems uncommon CA especially map heat map Covid cases matter P-word (censored rule #4) follow Highway 99.

I wish conversations sub, including P-word, information could useful targeting messaging looking needs done combat pandemic (as well future ones). pretty much know countries strict lockdowns uncontrollable surges next 45 days.

Cool. mean... experience freedom threatened? CVSes around book 12 days something, very, rare find anything area within 5-day window.

I used planned test, weekend going granddad's 94th birthday party I'm testing day before, booked 12 days advance. Lmao fuck sake man know though. That's getting. Vaccinated spread less often, less severe less deadly! People still get measles polio everyone vaccinated everyone much safe! Holy crap conversation like taking 3rd grader. logic behind this? tried hard. son (21mo) needs live, grow, develop. outdoor play dates only. allowed vaccinated adults around him. start Delta wave go bar mitzvah. planned even week prior wave didn’t look bad. took every reasonable precaution, but…he got COVID.

Fortunately, barely symptoms. slept bit usual, maybe coughed twice, played, ate drank, smiled 102.5F fever didn’t even know had. guess gives relief; immunity now. wish hadn’t earned way.

But kids haven’t lucky. think reason ""the studies peer reviewed""   Vaccines mandated entire population. Cmon now, we're legally required vaccinate domesticated dogs rabies, distemper parvo, diseases fatal, kill humans. 

We stronger requirements dogs ourselves. here…….  That's read it. misleading. 

The vaccine prevent infection transmission, 100% success rate.

So opens doors anti-vax trolls saying ""the vaccine stop getting covid."" That's interesting, thanks that. high 87% 80+ crazy. 44% 19-69 still way higher I'd believed well. numbers later many hospitalizations (est) they've prevented good see still.  No, didn't, original post simply quoted this:

*""I 66 years old used car. never new car""*

To said ""she's living poverty."" 
Not new car =/= living poverty.

She's researching mRNA many years, mean living poverty entire duration years.

Either way think agree person like funded ass research. bleach. Yeah.

I problems going eat eating outdoors - zero desire sit enclosed space people know breathe shit.

The bottom line we're going get covid control. going become endemic -- mutations shown us that, least near term future, likely evolve worse rather ""weaken"" like many hoped.

It's interesting many thread chastising looking reality situation acting accordingly.

If somehow destroy covid (some miracle cure even republicans/antivaxxers get behind) -- sure I'll go back eating indoors grocery shopping unmasked. That's gonna happen though. types colds people talking usually ever included vaccine research don’t really cause serious illness. tons there, mainly annoyance. get sick, it’s part life. healthy, usually times year nothing bad. feel like reasonable trade living full life surrounded people. general strike ~ 
National General Strike October 15
r/OctoberStrike  That’s US nationalized supply whole supply chain. Globally still enough equipment, manpower raw materials vaccinate whole world, matter much money spend. seriously believe odds ratio nearly twenty achievable confounder, could equally argued direction? sincerely believe booster could ""no effect""?

To put another way: imagine ethics board. aware broad scientific consensus relationship antibody titers immunity, also specific empiric results relationship prior covid-19 vaccine studies, well recent studies correlations real-world, observed clinical outcomes. Would approve controlled study point *half group vulnerable people received placebo?* also owns 1200 units. could house 2500 3000+ people. dozen dying using totally there. husband broke leg green  Yep Spain near top list terms % population vaccinated.

Interesting still wave cases, seems ending, fatalities 1/5 previous peak.

I think areas least 65% vaccination see thing, higher peaks longer waves lower levels vaccination get end result. another wave come from? suspect current wave driven schools one time thing. think read stories Herman Cain awards? Genuinely 1 600 Americans died Covid. Remember assholes kept saying small death rate was? Christian relatives thought going use excuse. Instead said ""RNA vaccines change DNA"" j&amp;j instead.  want get sick working knife missiles. I'm sure mistresses wealthy connected public figures still are. Fair enough. complaint figure AAP truly odds kid infection hospitalized. odds kid positive test, properly recorded relevant authorities, hospitalized. edit post say ""odds recorded positive test hospitalized."" That’s exactly works. amount antigen booster shot finite, that’s correct. However enough (by design) trigger B cells start producing antibodies cognate antigen (the spike protein) turn kick Tcell response. One antigen cleared, immune system remember keeping memory B cells around ready react antigen. Additionally, cell response next exposure antigen faster since R_0 factor viral load delta high it’s decently likely keep getting “reminders” outside world post vaccine keeps immune system guard. becomes endemic, yeah may need boosters longer getting reminder, point we’ll probably paired flu shot. take joy deaths anti-vaxxers. They're misguided; deserve death sentence. hand, nature care ""deserves"" I, frankly, see reason get upset do. leaves strong feeling all. They're killing themselves... what?

I attitude toward counterrevolution. (I'm going get specific; polit1cs filter.) People pushed fight interests retrench imaginary past, puts opposite want genuine economic progress, there's joy watching people, often ""strawberry color"" states, suffer right now... never real enemy first place.

What anger lot innocents die-- people took vaccine breakthrough cases, people conditions bounced flooded ERs-- nonsense. Let's completely ignore fact passed line long ago requiring vaccinations schools sure continue dramatic world ending require vaccination part society, something now. USA, Dolly exceeded demand since April-May. Here, problem ignorance. find nothing wrong . Yeah... cant help stupid help others So, reality, matter. Thanks confirming. Cuba sends specialists lot international institutions, also one ways go around blockade import expensive medical equipment goods.

Being important, lying accomplishments would detrimental whole image respect could hurt economy. point, much terrible thing say, refuse vaccine send home let God sort out. want help offered last list things go south them. Simple solution: refused vaccine “did research” aka “I read Facebook post saying vaccine gives 6g ultra cancer” don’t get bed. video cringe. highest chance survival. school/daycare?  Agree 100%  Lol, hope brings swollen testicles Dr. Robert Monroe next. Multiply everyone's rent 10x. Offer 90% discounts units everyone vaccinated.

Why stop covid vaccines? use tactics things? Jewish landlord people eat bacon? vegan landlord thing people eating meat? bunch things? 

I disagree landlord kicking tenants personal beliefs. regardless beliefs are. Vaccine refusers killing people.  True. ""By Easter 2022"" still possible !!! That’s they’re (whoever think know better rest us) wanting. I’ve got shot - I’m putting mask on. got shot order wear mask…I’ve done job.  Thats... lot   go find someone street invite home think human right. tell people work going yourself.  They've approved FDA. longer experimental. happened field hospitals? problem didn’t mention it’s yeah wonder would even matter got Pfizer booster I’m sure   I'm getting real sick FDA's overly bureaucratic paternalistic attitude.

Whether something ""needed"" judgment call made FDA. 

Just tell whether safe that's good enough. would interested see average number children per antivax family vs average number children per decent human family Go.......  Well, no. That’s true. dire situations, medical resources go either urgent/sickest first weighted lottery. Again, wrong. every major disaster, like Hurricane Katrina Paris attacks, hospitals never adopted “maximize survivor policy.” protocol attend sickest first urgent cases first. making decisions. Covid patients, regardless vaccination status, actually good surviving rates, recent ligature suggested treatment steroids ventilation significantly increases chances recovery. Oh man... shits gotten way beyond reasonable society putting with.  
I've burst appendix- worst pain imaginable. can't imagine sitting bursting waiting bed bunch Fox News OAN viewers take pandemic seriously.  
This shits straight Idiocracy. true, got breakthrough almost 6 months J&amp;J shot. Health department said would call instructions.....never did. Never told quarantine, nothing. count, I've got 2 days left isolate. Very, mild infection way. I've read, guess got natural booster. one saying vitamin C ""cures common cold"". evidence supplements like vitamin C, vitamin especially, may play protective role covid. person responding saying vitamin C seems pretty safe common. may, potentially, boost one's immune system. *vaccinated* person sees fit take it, harm that? everything ivermectin.  would ssme. Move protect yourself. never eradicated this, weaken time. comment mentions comes enough trained medical staff additional beds. plenty hospitals ""empty"" beds unstaffed beds arent available patients. ICU nurses country assigned 6+ patients shift due staffing shortages. 

We lost thousands healthcare workers covid last year half, thousands burnout leave medical field due compassion fatigue mental physical health, reasons lack childcare. 

It really comes enough doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, support staff cover field hospitals even hospital beds.  really doubt good policy. understand use precautionary principle things (NPIs, border closure exc.) vaccines, also effective compatible society functioning normally. never waiter data efficacy os masks , business closures WFH mandating things. It’s Trump got promoted it.  Quite frankly, trying determine IFR (Infection Fatality Rate), deaths counted infection required count death. want count net effect pandemic, means, count it. IFR, CFR matter, defined scientific terms tell us properties COVID-19 disease itself. get it, we’re gonna end pandemic we’re working global scale. rich countries donate cause, unfortunately. 
I’m mostly unsurprised moderna Pfizer pushing boosters (where they’ll make money)  definitely violation first amendment 14th amendment. treated others without discriminatory intent perfectly constitutional. Similarly, going permanently enjoined violation Title VII.

Being protected class protect treated others.

It's preliminary injunction likelihood irreparable harm. Covid completely eradicated lifetime. history humanity, took us 200 years eradicate 1 infectious disease: smallpox. work one largest med centers NYC. told day 1 (as possible scenario). hard us mentally, eventually hope best case scenario: Delta peters (has claimed enough vulnerable lives created natural immunity+vaccine), Covid weaken become regular recurrence like flu. Viruses exist sans hosts. Ah shit. got Pfizer. reread post didn’t see Moderna first time. bad   Probably  No, really done anything yet. Aside CT regular bloodwork. One suggested possibly H.Pylori, another said said something else, another bacteria. Basically saying ""I'm sure, maybe this, really specialty"". 2 offered scopes me, also suggested go someone else. I'm really hoping friday last someone else. sucks man. available online though! Exactly.   much sympathy people places like that. feel they've made choices top bottom. I'm sorry innocent people harmed that's far go. money coming poor countries unfortunately. Thank you! lol, definitely do, think driven anxiety, going get scheduled vaccinations report back after. Thank again! curious vaccine? grandmother got second shot Moderna March, know Pfizer vaccine choice boosters far stock every drug store around 30 miles us past month. checking every days. CVS enter booster vaccination cards?  learn elders sturborness antivax attitude genetical evolution hapenning genetical trait.  mask change welcome. Let know questions. Everyone deserves housing. do. do. human right. rapid home tests easily available, buy basically drug store online.  disagree anything saying. going consequences lot nurses leaving short term. Long term? Great, dangerous staffing shortage pandemic. That's I'm saying. I'm taking stance mandate  think would argue vaccine equity directly related actual science. mostly unvaccinated parts world, there's opportunity mutation. Similar got delta. 3rd shot helps mutations probably much first shot another person's arm. Could mistaken that's impression. even know people vaccinated not? Nicki Minaj saying covid-19 relevant anything? vet every idiot opinion even though zero epidemiological training experience? not, let keep it. guess civil war relevant people Alabama WWII whatever reason.i see now, “but people die 1861-1865?”  FWIW, father (60+) health issues (not technically immunocompromised) able get booster CVS today. hasn’t 8 months since last dose didn’t ask questions. See here's thing, someone starving, steal die. choice. Guess what, tenants choice, go get vaccinated, free easy. Also treating tenants poor deserve handout. issue someone steals can't pay rent left choices. that's case situation. 

Also someone needs support financially, that's individual businesses provide help. That's government do. poor, go apply foods stamps subsidize housing. portable cheap air cleaners basically revolutionary virus vastly underestimated whole pandemic?

I know lot surprised none Holy shit heavily downvoted? People really wanting Landlords access people’s medical records?!?!?! 

What fuck even wrong Reddit. fully vaccinated, support vaccine shit like insane.  Same. reason decided it? June, July August threw 12.5 **million** doses. feel bad taking one? Nope. situation long lines get it, shortage vaccines, done it. Vaccine side-effects never, point history, arisen beyond three month mark

That's good know, thank almost sounds fictional. US, always think Australia upside backwards us, us backwards.

At point, would gladly put oversized spiders scary animals government actually working people. Thats fair statement. wish could say felt same, think pandemic erased need want certain social things mind. road I'm right now. That’s true kids didn’t want learn otherwise baseline equipped school districts. 

There ton schools resources. went k-12 SC, good district. There’s documentary schools state don’t basic necessities like heat winter clean water.

Seoul's daily coronavirus caseload hits all-time high much wrong there. Look numbers aren’t going down. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* God can’t even imagine ward full infected. Hacking other, spewing Covid air groaning wailing pain. think 90% might like that, apathetic know proper risk assessment Every defense contractor this, going go? blue collars sure walking away $35/hour jobs, pensions healthcare life (just like military people 17 years rant rave, they'll get shot)  Wow, happy friend! Relief difficult come by. life changing.

I've many surface level tests. got sick early on, lot visit notes include allude psychosomatic. Since time, lot symptoms known young people thought afflicted. taken seriously whole challenge.

I saw MS diagnoses becoming common... wonder many diagnoses funnel sort new covid specific diagnosis, stay MS, ME, POTS, etc camps. would waste money making study it? science YET showing may effective, win Nobel peace prize anti viral all… First , belief belief. cannot control belief have. brain either believes doesn’t. Religious non-religious. Ie. don’t believe Santa , don’t. 

While understand saying think we’re getting mixed ,but could wrong. 

My thinking , god may god god , neighbors god, etc. 
The government shouldn’t involved decided amounts religious belief amounts deeply held personal belief. neighbor doesn’t believe typical Abrahamic god , that’s fine. believes god/goddess approve alcohol , dancing , sex , vaccinations would wrong try force regardless religious standpoint holds god worships. Still average Chinese life pretty normal, like lives western world now. Ever since reading stop sense smell, I've terrified neurological affects covid. There's something deeply wrong able interfere like that. usual disease symptom Summary: 

Pediatric endocrinologists seeing marked increase diagnosis Types 1 2 pediatric diabetes compared pre-pandemic period.

Some, researchers hypothesize environmental factors related COVID play triggering diabetes onset related severe emotional stress. Others, however, studying Sars-CoV-2 infection pancreatic beta cells produce insulin possible disruption body's ability regulate blood sugar. Yeah, someone three shots uncomfortable non-serious side effects week time, think os reasonable say getting shots still waaaay easier say, beating addiction maintaining perfect lifestyle diet exercise. people, getting vax gonna take zero dollars, couple hours total set up, go get, etc, maybe sore arm mild yucky feeling day two. Unlike ‘lifestyle choices’ require commitment every single day. use science. simply lacking education know everything rooted science, using denial way isolate group society. 
Plus one born innate religious beliefs—they taught. Thus choice made teach old, incorrect, possibly dangerous ideas new. accept irrational ideas—religion—take precedent rational (science) comes matters public security anyway? essential people remove masks talking me. won't, I'm talking them. flu shot effectiveness typically quite low. shot greater 60% effectiveness since 2010. Here's graph CDC charting effectiveness year- reason ineffective basically vaccine manufacturers guess dominant strain almost year flu season order ramp manufacturing. really depends accurate models tend every year.  Disaster medical care gonna new norm unfortunately. Ah...clearly u read article. type 1 2 caused covid 19 infection. You’re absolutely right, there’s point using healthcare budget staffing bunch empty beds. 

But current situation really bad. There’s normally 170 ICU beds Alberta., roughly 150 ICU patients. Currently, despite 100 extra beds added, 44 non-COVID patients ICU. 

Has whole province gotten way healthier, even though preventative medicine vastly scaled back 18 months? No, criteria admission ICU greatly increased, patients make lower level care. ICU doctor AMA r/Alberta went much better detail. Different discussion different day... However, lipreading impossible masks. I’m curious they’re Japan, using commonly treatment COVID Christian Scientists, one. believe all-powerful God provide every need. Quite different ""God helps help themselves"" crowd, shun hospitals medical treatment. major court cases US involving them, religious rights upheld stricken courts past, mostly relating children.  would thought endless lock therefore sedentary life styles would cause diabetes? /s True vaccines alike - moderna active vaccine dose.  Yes you’re right. everyone vaxxed room can’t get safer that. 

Of course going people slip 90 percent people room vaxxed risk low mask not. direct quote, don’t even know said agree. Might time new doctor! Tylenol Tums widely regarded safe pregnancy. Suspended without pay would likely mean can’t claim unemployment benefits since haven’t fired yet. know post-covid feelings, message made tear up. Kindness scarce. Thank yours. *internet hugs* Great news them. mRNA vaccines don’t contain used fetal cells produce them

Sounds like god answered prayers, anyone getting Pfizer Moderna shot ignoring great physician’s wisdom susceptible satan wants death harm

Fun fact, fetal cells used vaccines decedents cells donated 1970’s mind sharing, mediation ?  reply entirely irrelevant comment. Please copy paste without reading understanding comment replying to.

What cited real world, apples apples study analysing vaccine efficiency **against serious disease** New England Journal medicine, published September 8th, 2021. 

That vox video March 2021 entirely irrelevant. true numbers original studies cannot directly compared. populations trials may different, variants circulating may different.

But vox saying efficiency hospitalization severe disease 100% misleading. trials video talks statistical power determine effectiveness serious disease high level confidence.

Here's Janssen vaccine briefing numbers originally reported media from: 17. Vaccine Efficacy First Occurrence COVID-19 Requiring Medical Intervention Based on
MRU, Onset Least 14 Least 28 Days Vaccination, Per-Protocol Set, Study example, vaccine efficiency outcome indeed 100%, 95% confidence interval 31.1% 100%. trial many ways measuring hospitalization death, confidence intervals narrower, even wider. underpowered measure effectiveness serious disease. almost like people use bible blank slate interpret whatever want mean...... understand all. military requiring vaccines forever - like ever...  think first full Moderna approval world?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good question! 1) vaccinated population much quickly efficiently places, 2) cohesive nationwide monitoring system (which US notably lacks) 3) approved third shots July places still debating them. remaining antivaxers definition people going argued getting shot things happen people. They've bought hard, self-worth tied it, marching ICU matter. Whoever vaccinated (I'm assuming pharmacist) even check ID insurance card, barely looked me. looked vaccine card already given shot. know whether could cause issues insurance, see how.. presumably signed new patient signed permission request records

yes, signed new patient. new doc immunization records (like vaccine date administered, etc.), know anything allergies have, wanted get old elementary school record doctor got vaccines way

thank -- look contacting school district (my actual elementary, middle school, high school got closed 8 years ago) see get phone number doctor's office least That's terrifying. Hope good news docs soon hope don’t maim many kids trust you. understand perspective. think way get unvaccinated people become vaccinated mandate vaccine, rather mandate suffering. Ya know? spot red cap gormless look face. lowering age Pfizer? you’re unvaccinated choice you’re piece shit boat eyes. don’t care color skin is. suck human. think makes sense given delta wave likely final one. people getting hospitalized unvaccinated. places high vaccination rates seeing many people hospitals. sense, places COVID burning going ""catch up"" way natural immunity. ideal, obviously, going take us end one way another. really don’t need booster now, ignore them.

But people want get one, what's downside? long safe EXTREMELY LIKELY effective, allow people make informed choice. run phase 3 study reccomend second dose measles vaccine, noticed increase breakthrough cases used logics. feel like it'd good idea move golf Mexico Yes, biggest city country fine true. 80% great . People care there. know better infectious disease experts! Hope good night man. Stay safe. I'm glad see I'm alone. I’m frustrated CDC trying public relations work. They’re doctors scientists. tell truth leave public messaging politicians.

We’re *still* paying price “masks don’t really protect you” BS beginning pandemic. curve flattened... Florida happened.


the majority metro areas, long wait times. misinformed population areas issue rising. 


currently averaging 20min wait times Las Vegas, largest employers pushing immunization helping lot. Mandates issue lose medical staff it. exactly purpose take place? someone's alternative starve, yes damn well steal food. 

However normal matter course position lot like ""everyone given access food need, treated something sell part life away someone else order acquire."" quite different encouraging theft. another regurgitated ""gun shot""-type story proved false? time agree needed, might late. can't sit around wait every bit data, data prepared fact.

 signs point waning immunity several months third shot may integral part long term protection. COVID worse ever, going get better winter. need get rid religious exception. It’s bs wow, okay. J&amp;J def question then. Looks like Moderna way go. they're homeless already? home? 

The function landlord nothing extracting money. Even grandfather's capitalism criticize ""rent-seeking"" behavior takes create value. 

The people individuals exist, extremely cruel bare minimum function landlord absolutely deserves additional critique. I'm concerned eliminating function landlord taking specific people put role. 

I also issue people willingly avoid vaccine many times stated would support government mandate. like private entities choosing make people suffer. think need increase homelessness increase vaccination rates. think thing tolerable. 

I'm usually one slippery slope arguments, way people frothing mouth defend alarming me. easily see examples. Someone's smoker, alcoholic, addict? lease you. Someone's nurse covid ward? Sorry even riskier around unvaccinated person daily contact covid, need protect residents. AIDS patient? Out. forth.

I understand people actively want make unvaccinated suffer could make get vaccinated. guess instinct unnecessarily cruel Also masks going prevent he’s one wearing it. Synergy people wearing made big difference. Yeah, look well that’s worked them. “I’m idiot idiots” isn’t justification something idiotic. wish could turn away unvaccinated covid patients know people legitimately can't get vaccine. least social media research lol. spouting Herman Caine award type bullshit, fuck it, going home. wanted.  appreciate help, thank struggling anxiety

I definitely am. keep getting thoughts ""first know allergic reactions blood clots, else going learn future know know would go one mRNA vaccines

yeah, leaning towards Moderna right Wyoming eradicated COVID Catholics definitely provaccine. comes Vatican itself. never heard Baptist faith antivax, well. trust experts? Good! bet you’ll think it’s murderous many European schools CDC’s explicitly recommending children wear masks don’t actually care, want feel better people. It’s seriously messed haven’t approved boosters guys yet. I’m eager get shot, I’m fully favor letting healthcare workers go front line. many deaths truck drivers? happened last month chest pains. Went ER jam packed. thought sure made mistake calling ambulance called less 2 minutes. Turned heart attack. also got last room available time. Okay and? don’t care unvaxxed 12?   rural death rates generally higher non-rural? make sense would amplified pandemic? Prompt access care issue rural America rely heavily air ambulance. anything, strong argument rural folks vigilant preventive measures COVID illnesses accidents. reality, vaccination, masking, etc. lax rural area.   Well think careful oversimplify. I've lived around half life two countries good enough understanding differences. Im quite sure do. heard read hospitals US for-profit? non-profit. lots for-profit non-profit actors. issue money spent per capita US long shot, almost double Canada. think thinking big difference Canada cannot handle big covid wave well comparable US systems. Thank God Canadians less dumb Americans covid overall (Alberta notwithstanding).

Besides $ spent, biggest difference setup pays course, Canada single (gov't entity) payer funds raised taxation. younger Senior US often provided employer sponsored plans premium typically comes paycheck typically employers pays even bigger chunk subscriber. different system honestly. course way health care administers different parts.  varies greatly state state provide province. live (Massachusetts) gaps - rare lack health insurance. good health care anywhere earth (matches human development index top US). true regions really matters live. Likewise last province lived Canada Nova Scotia health care there, sorry say, comparitatvely poor worsening. can't even get family doctor years move there. Also family member NS sick put ambulance sent town hospital city hospital three hours away conditioned worsened ride almost killed him, left much worse shape franky never recovered injuries. read numbers family who've lived it. doubt worst healthcare Canada better underinsured uninsured US. again, generalize system better depends who's asking!

System wise right capitalism US healthcare system. speeds innovation incredibly ugly too. (including smaller countries like Canada regulate drug prices fiercely) benefit multi-payer systems (i.e. US) basically powered drug industry made boatfuls money also helped raise life expectancy dramatically last 25 years. times control FDA reigns in. lifted everyone's boat go bankrupt healthcare US.... thing Canada different - typically due drug prices hospitalization. Health care complicated.   one true unlike last story similar remember correctly gunshot wound victims waiting outside hospitals Oklahoma? Uh, no, executive order wouldn’t solve that. let's get back office miss.each other! Forever?! lost mind? upvoted? thing is, agree you. case, think landlord made right choice. much agency scenario? No, agree that. making right choice using unearned power wrong? don’t think so. Landlord-tenant power imbalances society-wide problem, instance wouldn’t change either way. Also, think abuses landlords going useful creating support housing reform landlords right thing (even bc interests converge tenants’). understand trying “follow science” 

They ""following science"". scientists regulators feel important make symbolic gesture vaccine equity reassure people vaccinated make sure protected disease winter approaches. that's university's started back undergrads back stupid.

Source: guess interact said undergrads.  shallow call wedding bc ur husbands dick stopped working bc vaccine? (I know bc vaccine, trying follow shit logic) know help, let's fire third nurses. Stop admitting unvaccinated Covid sufferers. Let die home, everyone else doesn’t pay price stupidity.

Make fair, make face consequences choices.    Carolinas. Kinda surprised see 30%ish Michiganders 25 degree, kinda surprised. 

At least we're top half chart guess tho Same. concerned arm put getting it. Yeah, need figure best way first though. Vitamin C cured even common cold we'd know now. doesn't. snake oil.  current doctor get records previous ones. presumably signed new patient signed permission request records...so tldr, need make phone calls make sure need copy jump drive.

your old elementary school record doctor got vaccines way 
    improvements made ventilation system?** 
    newer buildings rely mechanical heating, ventilation air-conditioning systems, known HVAC, use combination air filters outdoor air dilute remove viral particles pollutants. Buildings take number steps improve performance ventilation systems increase amount fresh air, including: 
     MERV ratings**  
    filters used ventilation systems what’s known MERV rating (MERV stands Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values). higher rating, better filter trapping specific types particles. 
  pandemic, many buildings used MERV 8 filters, allow comfort energy efficiency aren’t designed infection control. New industry guidelines advise buildings upgrade least MERV 13 filter, traps 85 percent risky particles. However, every ventilation system upgrade MERV 13 filter. cases, MERV 11 filter may highest grade filter system handle.  
      demand-controlled ventilation**  
   save energy, systems monitor building occupancy based carbon dioxide levels, rise exhale. fewer people building, system reduces rate outdoor air. “It’s way stop ventilating space save money,” said Richard Corsi, incoming dean College Engineering University California, Davis. “But people leave area, need continue ventilate purge space aerosol particles left air.” 
     outdoor air**  
   quality experts recommend adjusting outdoor air dampers, movable plates bring outside air. isn’t advised communities poor outdoor air quality, areas active intimidated asking ventilation systems. company done work answers ready, right answers obvious. Recently suggested friend ask gym done improve ventilation. vaccinated goes gym it’s busy, reply increased heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) filters hospital-grade MERV 13,” wrote. “And opened outdoor HVAC dampers achieve higher level air exchange center.” 
   windows opened?** 
   older buildings classrooms may modern ventilation systems, simply opening windows improve air quality. recent study infected college students isolation dormitory University Oregon found [opening could reduce amount coronavirus room opening window help, effect greater cross ventilate opening windows different sides room. Open windows aren’t practical cold weather areas poor outdoor air quality. Adding box fans windows turning exhaust fans kitchen bathroom areas also improve ventilation homes buildings without modern systems. 
     air change rate?** 
   air changes per hour, ACH, number industry standard indicate often air room replaced outdoor air. (Cleaning air filters create equivalent air change.) experts suggest [four six air changes per (that’s fresh clean air every 10 15 minutes), many buildings fall short standard. It’s recommended schools ACH least 3, many classrooms closer 1.5, experts say. Airplanes newer hospitals may anywhere 10 20 air changes per hour. Air change rates equivalent improved upgrading overall ventilation system filters, increasing amount outdoor air (by opening windows ventilation dampers), adding exhaust fans adding portable air filters. 
  there’s magic number air change rates avoid Covid-19, higher better, said Dr. Corsi. 
      using portable air cleaners?** 
  air cleaners equipped HEPA filters surprisingly good job removing viral particles air, right machine used size space. Look machine clean air delivery rate, CADR, least 300 cubic feet per minute, read manufacturer guidance choosing room size. may need one machine larger space. Association Home Appliance Manufacturers [has guide buying air  
  air cleaner partly compensate less efficient ventilation system, depending size room. cases, “one little portable air cleaners effectively double ventilation rate classroom,” said Dr. Corsi. 
   study Melbourne recently showed adding two portable air cleaners patient’s room eliminated 99 percent aerosols minutes, reportedly raising protection level equal 30 air changes per hour. 
     monitoring air quality?** 
   dioxide sensors indicate well ventilation system working. Virus scientists air quality experts sometimes carry portable CO2 detection devices. Linsey Marr Virginia Tech, one world’s leading experts viral transmission, used device check levels gym grocery stores. 
  dioxide exhaled breath,” said Dr. Marr. “If levels get high indoors, means people’s exhaled breath building up, exhaled breath course could contain virus someone infected.”
  County public Maryland, use CO2 sensors school cafeterias monitor air quality. company isn’t using CO2 monitoring, buy machine $100 $200. general, don’t want CO2 number rise 800. gyms, people breathing heavily, Dr. Marr advises leaving masking number goes 600. 
   building rely unproven technologies?** 
  companies installing Environmental Protection Agency calls “emerging technologies,” including one called needlepoint bipolar ionization system. system claims use positive negative particles help remove viruses air. many world’s leading experts indoor air quality, including [Joseph Harvard [Shelly University Colorado, Boulder, questioned [effectiveness “There’s reason haven’t seen single indoor air quality expert recommend technology,” tweeted Dr. Allen. 
  American Society Heating, Refrigerating Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), makes recommendations indoor air quality standards, said bipolar ionization one several unproven technologies. “Convincing, scientifically rigorous, peer-reviewed studies currently exist emerging technologies,” [the group 
   E.P.A. said another concern devices create potentially harmful byproducts. “As typical newer technologies, evidence safety effectiveness less documented established ones, filtration,” [the agency wrote “Bipolar ionization potential generate ozone potentially harmful byproducts indoors.” 
    skepticism technology, many workplaces installing anyway. 
    companies done great job marketing,” said Dr. Marr. “It makes businesses feel like they’ve done something.” home, landlords home.

If want stay, get vaccinated. want get vaccinated, find somewhere else live. simple.

Why hate landlords much? think evil, horrible, greedy property owning capitalist pigs?

Why spend hate unvaccinated legitimately killing people causing suffering? humanities sake *pray* sterilization.  think I've heard history class. Never really ends well.  “We learned lot first wave. one thing learned is, unlike state New York state New Jersey, Mississippi never huge peak,” Gov. Reeves said May 27, 2020.

Oof. 

(sorry idk properly quote mobile) really don’t understand us soo publicly funded even run Health care everyone full access medical treatment.

people believe misinformation basically think people like baked excuse go stuff ""sorry covids bad again"" plus people like working home ask anything there? Also could create issues insurance?  logic, people steal food. Grocery store restaurants ton food wastage okay walk pay right? Recent study shown Moderna best protection time, 95% protection severe outcomes, Pfizer lost efficacy 80%, J&amp;J said risk J&amp;J little data CDC FDA extremely slow provide new guidance anything change. everyone get boosters point, JJ folks asked wait months longer objectively less protection.

For example, CDC recommends booster immunocompromise folk mRNA vaccines, say ""LOL idk, pls wait"" J&amp;J.

It's gonna like waiting software updates offbrand cell phone whole pandemic. Add info Medical ID phone. added vaccine brand, lot number, date administered. way even you’re incapacitated see info. Shhhhh... get angry facts logic. Hence downvotes. think word 'history' means far definition. don’t know put “study” scare quotes, never used word. Israeli health ministry found interesting enough talk public, tend trust guy reddit looking excuses keep stupid thing looking forward Thanks completely missing point, reading said. Either way, thanks course. experts *have data upon decide*. article experts saying (completely rightly) real world data Israel useless. *All have* phase 1 studies. RCTs determine actual boost efficacy boosters; trials would take least months, possibly years. phase 1s show 42-fold improvement antibody neutralization, previous science know mean several-fold decrease risk.

This listening experts. money. FDA never spends money trials; let companies it. hole for-profit trials, companies satisfied phase 1 data have. Especially considering hospital buildings really meant lifespan 50 years. least that’s learned planning design construction course. It’s actually amazing. airport Miami using now. doggos accurate PCR tests *instant* smell. Shouldn’t ER prioritizing people like this? life would never icu long.  ....than year history *so far* Kanye favorite artist verse worst part MBTDF me. dislike much check work. go get free shot. bye ✌️  Sigh...I'm always torn issue even though I'm atheist I'm willing prevent someone believing whatever want. problem bronze age mythology used get around laws land. Good! go back rules effect. Nicki Minaj's concern general public.

And social media, people talk acutely aware legal moral problems, memes jokes parked ready. likely can't bear Tweets mocking husband's horrible behavior go viral, snappy comeback make.

On hand, playing ball whole antivax thing. name trends now, assured jokes husband allowed near son's daycare, people talking antivax ridiculousness, strongly suspect that's prefers.   probably help. Ugh bureaucrats executed anything well pandemic? lease provides option landlord end lease time reason.  Medical malpractice attorney here. many states, lawsuit would come nothing. emergency proclamations bar civil suits hospitals doctors treating Covid. common disaster situations like earthquakes, wars, hurricanes, etc. idea standards go window there's way doctors treat everyone ""normal"" standard care. tried, they'd run supplies, rooms, etc, one would get treated, better lower, best-we-can-do treatment many people possible normal treatment few. bet right

Couple sources relative estimates:

Important note well, actual lost combat number far less died illness, absolutely count shows numerous ways die Civil War. Many doctors agenda (or different agenda CDC), look entire US population includes lot dumb people. CDC consider things public health perspective whereas individual doctor could giving individual patient advice.  Where's Dr. House need him? 

He would made sure regular patients got beds unvaxxed COVID patients get pallet hall floor.

I really really wish writers ""House"" would write absolute killer monologue unvaxxed, Hugh Laurie could put Dr. House persona monologue camera Youtube Twitter smething. guarantee would break internet. anti vaxer “doctors” &amp; “nurses” course.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Florida probably rent controls. Doubt would stay rent became x100 next month. main concern , son bad reaction 2nd vaccine. take ER due chest pain ..thankfully wasn’t myocarditis ran test nonetheless disconcerting dad vaccinated died last week. got Covid (Delta variant) fully vaxxed February. almost symptoms. lost consciousness home one day. hospitalized, declined rapidly, died. died Covid pneumonia MRSA ventilated. 

Delta known variants soon make vaccination short lived protections antibodies follow vaxxed, insurmountable people.  LA county 76% fully vaccinated still implementing program though. Yeah think there’s definitely lot factors consider. 

My question Israel different compared US? reached higher population vaccinated much faster US primarily Pfizer, they’re seeing much higher breakthrough cases. 

Could delay get second dose play factor long immunity could last?

I think regardless, decision made give booster shots fact still cannot control spread. also doesn’t help fact White House already stated we’ll need boosters plans roll starting next week, FDA decides approve, lot people won’t happy.  Yes, said June 30th:
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said people state ""less scared"" ""When believe living earth blip screen, scared things,"" said. Thank God indeed. imagine many deaths would Trump still president? Carnival Cruises, NCL, &amp; cruise lines cater people COVID, don’t see US Navy can’t.

Second hand smoke real issue.  vaccinated. risk complications hospitalizations Covid incredibly low. would rather paid accept inherently greater risk Covid, employer spend money bother this. 

I imagine market eventually going.  love hate corporations too, still prefer reasonable policies. People kicked communities long landlords. often take factors mortality rates. really matter.  sucks.

Covid fucking lot ppl up. 2. hospitals claiming covid deaths ought qualify. I’m disappointed everyone. agree you! Fox News reported too. Here's article stop ignorant. 

""COVID-19 kills Americans rate 1 500, data shows | Fox News"" States vaccination database cross reference send them. addition uploading pictures cards, fill form, it’s like upload forged image.  Bullshit I've contemplated this. Florida resident additional family planned relocate future. would need give deep thought serious undertaking well, increasingly seeking spend time creative pursuits get lot reward from. concur though. Thank thoughts.   sorry wife going thru. Delta variant affecting everyone. 🙏 Considering comment study illustrating higher death rate seems like really stupid question.  don’t care anyone says, 1000000% favor putting unvaccinated covid patients 18 bottom priority list. Treat everyone else first correct natural immunity real thing, getting kind immunity CLOGGING ICUS ERS UNVACCINATED PEOPLE DENYING CARE PEOPLE NON-COVID HEALTH EMERGENCY!!!!!!!!!!!!

This time test fate get natural way. FYI don’t put infected people ships. non-Covid patients. 

Still good idea, use non-infected patients. trying edgelord, safety anonymity... good. Honestly, there's many people thing large taken weakest among us, primarily elderly approaching end quality life.. recently science deniers... Constantly feign concern exhausting. number reflect Covid related deaths including deaths vaccine? Also school started. ignorant parents concerned children's Freedom restricted pushed masks. hostile? actually homeopathy. Consider googling word? know fave, literally understand means. Unfortunately nobody right home. talking morals, moral thing would get vaccinated. right renew lease reason. tenant protection laws Florida. Whether gets crossed ridiculous pro-covid Florida laws, I’m sure. know ton folks couldn’t really function day. Even got mine knocked abs made ill 36 hours. Never reaction quite like it.  dead tho Weho two weeks ago basically worked. lot places required proof vaccination enforce masks.

Although *did* end breakthrough case week later.... Somehow get feeling proud many deaths showing they’ve taken stand vaccine and, course, sanity. That’s valid question. read awhile back people mixing vaccines haven’t seen research it. Comes tolerance risk IMO. I’ve considered I’m 28 I’ll wait bit longer. 79 yo, maybe worthwhile. again, false sense security? 

Hopefully, Moderna approves boosters short term. hope everything works grandmother! hate people. We’re doomed. mean, understand argument. reasons virologists, immunologists, infectious disease doctors favor. Yes, Vitamin also snake oil du jour. 

I care people take vitamins, GTFO nebulous ""MAY play protective role"" homeopathic BS. That's snake oil salesman MO.

It either cures sickness doesn't. either prevents sickness, doesn't. ""MAY play"" business get antivaxxers pushing horse paste, drinking disinfectant, gargling iodine.  Tell get SinoVac vaccine. 💪🇨🇳 friend right fall stones pancreatitis can’t get surgery.  Allowing religious exemptions vaccination requirements seems like bad idea me.

But time, makes sense say, “You’re allowed religious exemption vaccination, interpretation beliefs leads conclude shouldn’t get vaccinated seems logically coherent us.”? Trying kind discussion believer never going go anywhere. Moderna better booster choice would say. wouldn’t get shot diminishes effectiveness again. Don’t apologize. American totally agrees you. 

The state education US appalling, amount student loan debt. calling anthro-apologist!?

Badumm tssss    is. surprised learn European CDC recommends elderly certain at-risk people. US CDC recommends virtually everyone. tried find difference never able get good answer. Them.  Infectious disease isn’t private health, it’s public health. Vaccines usually choice, requirement living society. go get booster want one. wait random group decide good, especially since wrote believe would help protection short term.  Pre-existing conditions limit care banned ACA US. may problems, one. curious actually true, decided look covid numbers compare state tax rates.

The case numbers show slight trend would predict (higher taxes associated lower numbers), deaths sources:

* Covid cases Tax rates seem apply intelligence thing intelligent. mutation goal. random occurrence certain effect. Nothing more.

It's like ascribing roulette ball intelligence choose certain number make win lose. fibromyalgia myself, long haul COVID symptoms sound shockingly similar.

I agree, quite range. Sure, states healthier states, think would nearly 20x difference hospitalization rates.

1) look subset J&amp;J trial occurred US without confound variants see J&amp;J still performs worse. 2) claim incidences rates different affecting vaccine efficacy also plain incorrect vaccine efficacy relative measure unvaccinated, specifically designed incidence rate affect numbers thrown around efficacy, 65%,72%, 89%, etc. actually combination average bunch different numbers.

Very people talking averages here. actually first I've seen anyone describe average multiple different vaccine efficacy outcomes. Many people clarify outcome talking about, yet see someone average outcomes serious outcome, effective vaccines are, statistically speaking. 

This one interpretation. would argue plausible interpretation vaccines protect less less prevent severe outcomes. dying extremely low bar treatment, hospitalization little higher, symptomatic infection high.

Finally, new data CDC looks hospitalization rates across Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J found HOSPITALIZATION vaccine efficacy J&amp;J lowest large Across ages, significantly higher among Moderna vaccine recipients (95%) among Pfizer-BioNTech (80%) Janssen (60%) vaccine third dose even better.

It’s well good giving older generations longer children, it’s examined enough women. many child bearing years left don’t want make mistake lack research. I’m anti-vaxx give alllll well established shots. NEED know longer implications. It’s much gamble. I’m glad don’t navigate world teens vaccines. I’d strongly encouraging daughter wait to. point would still considered booster part “series”? I'm aware. even know few! Granted, prioritized escaping. clearly worth NYC People getting vaccines still living fear.

People different risk tolerances. people YOLO investments options. Others keep money savings account. people cross even busy streets foot, others wait green pedestrian light even little traffic. one wrong prefer low risk high risk. come Colorado. Luttleton especially. Apparently immune civil cause waiting rooms empty.  amount lives saved research priceless. Though, wouldn’t mind number couple zeroes it. US healthcare system designed make money Canada built provide level Care pocket cost patients. 

Wait time long outside elective surgeries like Knee/Hip surgeries. present ER health emergency get care require immediately. 

I shoulder surgery (limpoma) elective meeting surgeon surgery 6 months, two months delayed covid. 

I've kids wife ER head injuries / broken hands etc treated released within 4-6 hours.  province atleast shifted ERs hospitals city moved Urgent care moved ER specialists 3 Large hosptials within minutes corners cities.  ERs waitimes non-emergancy care still happens, gone urgent care 2-3 hours (stiches, broken hands etc) covid hit. 

Its much stressed focusing resources/costs needed.. need 25% hospitals/healthcare sitting idle could focusing money insuring care delivered soon. 

I mean. shoulder surgery, Knee surgery (torn miniscus ) (twice) yearly monthly visits drs me, kids wife things paid parking parkade instead looking free parking street.

The USA handle surgery/treatment sooner competition hospitals amount money majority us citizens pay health care incredible co-workers avoid going dr unless 100% required.  go walkin ear infection leave 10$ perscription antibiotics... vaccines protect kind severe infection permanently damages lungs. J&amp;J little less effective, yes, would case got second J&amp;J shot.

If overwhelmed, let make easy: Moderna. go get moderna shot. sooner get first dose, better. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Hopefully means he’s healing guys lot time! cases surging among children school year begins -- many districts without mask mandates -- pandemic continues force quarantines disruptions. 
The latest weekly count new pediatric cases -- 243,373 -- 240% increase since July, American Academy Pediatrics said Monday.  source back saying.

I'd recommend editing accurate information.

1 every 5 **current cases** Florida. speak total deaths point. give us indication deaths next weeks, even that's subject demographic factors always perfect relationship.

Worldometers FL shy 50k deaths 680k total deaths. that's little 1 14.

As discussion kind came from, looking 1 death every 430 floridians. dozen deaths, expect right around 5000 people. people per units probably high number, that's assuming peanut butter spread. That's unlikely. rental units may skew towards higher affected people, elderly minorities. would thus lead higher rate death per person. got Covid Feb 2020 anyone taking seriously. Since then, I've kidney problems, mild anemia turned chronic moderate anemia, recently seizure &amp; visual hallucination first time I'm getting checked neurologist possible epilepsy.

There *nearly* enough people concerned long-term effects surviving Covid.   King, prime r/loveforlandlords material right whole lot believe 660,000 deaths. *still* post memes suggesting there's kind profit motive reporting death covid anything else. get sick, often last post going vent something catching pneumonia. people deny reality end sometimes further. successful lack effort resources. life's project now. Thank support. Georgia’s. Georgiarcc.org lists diversion status hospital. awful last weeks. Probably upon lease renewals, landlord might already leases ability evict reason. Friend kid (age 16) cold symptoms, come back school, got negative test, say sufficient, get note doctor order come back. schedule emergency visit doctor where... gave test.

I mean purpose testing we're going ignore results? People need stop think little. I’m aware, point people legitimately covid already whatever reason (they vegan, MS, whatever reason may agree still hold to) avoiding getting vaccinated aren’t complete idiots, really aren’t endangering anyone (statistically speaking).  MOD Approved Question:

Seniors: High Dose Flu Vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) vs. Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent)

I stuck tried true Fluzone High-Dose past half dozen years last years curious new kid block Fluad Quadrivalent wondered thought it.

FYI. flu even cold past half dozen flu seasons taking Fluzone High-Dose vaccination (always late September).  ongoing issue. person found lump last year waited feel safe going hospital get checked out, may able catch earlier. dalays treatment caused pandemic inevitably lead death happening earlier counted either. 
Terribly sorry loss. I'm sure maintenance ppl vaccinated. would want requirement around ppl day. Looks tetanus shot going get one. flu vaccine annual too. I'll 8 months past second dose less two weeks, would appreciate take another x months decide ""oh yeah, data support booster 6 months.""

I 8 months early October. would also really like FDA proactive approve boosters (it entirely possible COVID vaccination requires 3rd shot 6-8 months longer term immunity protection. 3 weeks first two shots might long enough proper secondary immune reaction antigen -- however, getting two doses everyone quickly absolutely justified situation)

I want go winter waning protection watch horror cases go Florida levels live belatedly decide offer protection.  school districts across country reopen, state officials voicing concern vulnerability children highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant takes aim unvaccinated.

And mandatory vaccinations necessary, protect teachers, parents children old enough receive vaccination. really. going shut anyway volume make worthwhile. That's get hospitals corporations first, Healthcare second. Thank kindness. know everyone says get vaccine available, person choice Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, one recommend? read Pfizer best choice terms side effects, also read getting Moderna results higher antibody count stronger mutated variants, side effects. other, benefit J&amp;J one done. Oh! Well fine then??? That's excess deaths, though, i.e. deaths pandemic. lot higher deaths Covid, i.e. deaths directly disease. 

Lots people scheduled surgery delayed, go doctor get screened something office closed afraid, closest ER full heart attack, etc. deaths caused pandemic, uncounted ""1/x people died Covid"" stat. 

It seems like deaths Covid also undercounted, degree. different types antibodies. Passive immunity breast milk getting vaccinated passing antibodies baby. 


If reason breast feed, baby protected. last breastfeed. (Basically like putting lubricant throat, stop providing longer it.)  


Just food thought. got pregnant. ask pumping older kid ( 14m time) would good passive, pediatrician said would unlikely effective drink enough make passive immunity work... ""But harmful try, course"" getting booster rest world vaccinated reminds small child told eat dinner ""children China starving."" understand eating dinner would help starving children, understand foregoing needed booster shot help countries yet vaccinated. see potentially millions people waning protection covid refused needed booster shots. appears height stupidity, outright callousness, part CDC WHO. tell - great. Sorry, disagree. think context important.


Lockdowns work virus gotten control like US, contact tracing longer feasible, especially lock borders.


But lockdowns work, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan clearly showed. real life, proven examples life largely remained unaffected outside short (relatively), hard lockdowns. goes directly ""facts"" however based on.


Taiwan hundreds cases per day long ago, single digits, certain businesses starting reopen. tens thousands people mandatory quarantines point. would never stopped outbreak lock recent months. undisputable fact. decrease mask usage opening things led breakthrough cases too? Nicki love you!!! Fauci bad man!! EXCELLENT - know anyone Florida brain obviously guy has. need contaminated building full dyingg people? think numbers staggering humans inbuilt mechanism able comprehend level loss. I've noticed see daily numbers think oh 140 dead today. sick think like that, places table never occupied, people never see seen loved ones again.

The stat today 1 every 500 people dead US quite useful making scale death manageable.

Was Anderson Cooper used segment briefly look lives one two people lost COVID? really effective personalising numbers. That's point. Right..in searching see Alberta ICU beds use pre-covid excess capacity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ad Christian command apply masks. find significant Christian opposition masks bewildering. 

There two ways looking Bible Sola Scriptura. ""Normative"" principal ""Regulative"" principal. 

Normative basically says anything prohibited acceptable. 

Regulative basically says bible explicitely commands permits.....though usually pertaining church practices (e.g. churches following sing psalms believe hymns worship songs commanded permitted Bible. 

Regulative pretty rare knowledge common amongst Calvinists (but even common). I'm saying enough people like this, restaurant industry less vibrant communities collapse. Outdoors feasible everywhere. 3000 2.7M.  tiny minority want get vaccinated. suffering long lasting side effects like ones described article? institutionally crazy folks get pass? what? beliefs consistently wrong? get vaccinated risking health - they're putting others risk. matter personal choice affects others.  Probably effective treatment  Dolly exceeded demand 

Is typo turn phrase I've never heard of? Free testing. School staff 100% vaxxed . kids 12 vaxxed gain access school grounds. face masks. 

And still feel bad kids. life won’t overcome thing like Polio Measles. Difference NYC last year caught guard measures place, much less vaccine. people idiots. Head CVS tell immunocompromised. That's did. I'm done FDA/CDC playing world humanitarian role. 100% agree.  Yes. Last year without vaccine available 10 month olds MRI check cancer canceled idea going two months. Hoping doesn’t happen winter needs next one. sick horrible selfish people.  people lifelong issues.

That's conjecture. know long covid symptoms last. around long enough make declarative statement like that. wish didn’t agree you, damn, good call. I’m fellow defensive pessimist; it’s actually great coping strategy!  Probably safe, human version restricted legit using piece paper. people give shot write info date, hand back you. health care system wholly unprepared this, largely traditionally make profit.  I'm sure understand math here. Let's say simplicity vaccine initially 95% effective, every 1000 unvaccinated cases, 50 vaccinated cases (given equal population vaccinated unvaccinated). 12 months, 36% cases among vaccinated. we're 50*1.36 = 68 cases. mean vaccine still ~93% effective?

Or misunderstanding 36% means here, actually 36 *percentage points*? [No major religious denomination opposes Jeez, sounds like state failing curtail infection rates. wonder who’s running state… (checks notes) oh yeah, another RePuBliCaN state.   well put! hospital full, sooner free bed better.

this curious NYC last year. talking hospitals overflowing people started dying fast hospitals never overflowed. local hospitals experiencing thing right now. census holding steady deaths skyrocketing. Jesus depressing. Especially 16 year old saying get it. know parroting parents; we've heard phrases before. Apparently, cousin almost dying enough, though.

The preacher scummy, too. double speak want trigger congregation wants actually protect them. Progress comes one funeral time really angers wondering ""Did waste time spent getting safe vaccine ready kids chasing anti vaxxers trying persuade take it?"" that's case, get right back line, anti-vaxxer let kid get protected. Cuba already vaccinating kids young 2, well respected health care system drop hat. cute think people read religious text. Usually wording something like, “Sincerely-Held Religious Belief"" tied text. much advocate guess. serious agenda right scientific community align stop anyone boosting rest world catches up

It's also data support giving boosters everyone yet. There's good chance make sense do, even rest world already enough doses. Spainiards ... got traumatized first wave

Or know, first hand knowledge exponential growth respiratory virus looks like. seems like ""Germans Danes"" (at least ones without good mathematical intuition) living blissful ignorance.

Most safety measures take trying protect miniscule odds deaths. Car accident death rates around 0.01% population everyone wears seatbelts, Covid death rates 50 100 times higher. think death rate activity needs drop 0.1% people stop overly concerned it. Putin believes vaccination works protect *him*, bet problem ~~forcing~~ requiring inner circle get vaccinated. minor correction: third (full) doses immunocompromised people authorized month ago. September 20th supposed start booster shots broad population 8 months second dose.

Fda advisory panel meets tomorrow discuss Pfizer. would say it’s much less slam dunk broadly authorized seemed month ago.No set date time moderna booster discussion, indeed submitted request half (50 microgram) dose used broad population booster. ponzi scheme pensions 

Mongui detected. (Basic Income government funded) Pensions Ponzi scheme. They're right.  callous say someone lost 6 people family.

What wrong you? trying help people. “All place” pretty vague. getting this? majority country hospital capacity issues. names letters dickhead. part? bother read article even look photo? students protesting relaxed policies insufficient (masking required, options virtual learning, etc). 

Maybe Texas governor go science class since one forbade mask mandates education? dystopian backwater They're agoraphobe. person seriously thinks rich people eat restaurants.

And obviously I’m gonna insult back since that’s communicate apparently.  Yeah accuse serving course treat respect. totally right everything continue day world full smelling roses. u understand it, current vaccine works Delta fine -- issue seems waning immunity, ability Delta evade vaccine. easier keep giving one that's available EUA rather changing shipping new vials stuff. # can’t triage work? someone mild covid symptoms- make ass wait two days broken arms gall bladders come in. Case rates per-capita basis. Still confusion = know nothing. said health department deliberately excluded religious exemptions mandate, requires health care workers vaccinated Sept. 27. said state’s attorneys arguing case court Sept. 28, personal opinion religious exemption legitimate excuse. 
“I’m aware sanctioned religious exemption organized religion, fact, encouraging opposite,” Hochul said. “Everybody pope encouraging people get vaccinated.” 
Hochul said New Yorkers right receive health care without worrying person attending might unvaccinated likely spread virus.

Freedom religion include freedom risk lives others including people members one's religion.

No religious exemptions allowed.  BS Joe Rogan spouts, right one thing: it’s pathetic country doesn’t mention healthy eating right big part this. horrible part 660k deaths reported covid ones. include heart attack, stroke, injury, etc. deaths could saved hospitals capacity understaffed.

Which one reasons usually look excess deaths.

Excess deaths difference number actual deaths number deaths predicted happen time period.

According CDC, 830k excess deaths since COVID started problem US. Call bluff. I’m replying comment article.

The comments replied about… US topic article? person front made mistake it’s helping type convo.

Well make mistake, don’t lie that. That’s weird. you’re trash 

Somehow don’t think care much insults called one. 

Moron. anyone information vaccines yet updated also cover delta variant?

I assuming time get boosters cover current dominant strains, idea what’s involved. I’m curious trigger update.   doses, that's issue. people charge like setting arbitrary dates stuff like this. held accountable anything preventable happens then.

One month school year started announced 16+ could get vaccinated, SCHOOL STARTS. regions Sweden vaccination centers idling, offered start immediately told wait. Unsuprisingly, schools opened took 48 hours classrooms 5+ tested positive. Yeah said forever Get give hug, seen forever  sorry hear that. That's I'm saying... everyone get vaccinated; pre-Feb 2021, one could. Tons people worked high-risk jobs they're suffering this.

THEN, refuse get vaccine. Completely different story.  husband’s step sister died covid pneumonia last night. never went hospital. two kids-18 20. 20 year old likely gave her. vaccinated supposedly doctor told (she health issues, husband daughter vaccinated. I’m sure bull crap true). 

They going funeral soon, really don’t want go. Husband vaccinated. two year old. don’t want around unvaccinated friends. unreasonable? may cause drama laws don’t go.  suppose 'argue' wrong word.

It seems xenophobic dehumanizing wave human usage simply India. Yeah I’m west coast I’m worried traveling. Every 60+ know vaxxed April know one hospitalized Moderna working flu/covid combo shot least get time  don’t know what’s going on? Lol okay? Pretty confident assessment internet stranger areas hour drive hospitals, one local small doctor town, less treatment available unless travel many go don’t ride far, think r fine. actually sad. healthcare lot southern areas good! U travel 2-4 hrs good doctor. know it! guess, offense opinions here, I’m bothered upvoted Sure lol.

If Canada let alone Alberta would know capacity ICU beds always maxed out. Lots hospitals even close intensive care units due lack staff.

Not exactly secret actual Caandian. like ok arbitrary number people getting dosed ok people's arbitrary standards.

When government tells gf needs get booster, do? someone tells ""get vaxxed"" without regard individual situation, going side her? Maybe dumb definitely uninformed. January CDC said women consult doctors whether get it. said women work high risk jobs chronic conditions get it. 

 
Starting April information coming pregnant women gotten vaccine adverse affects. Mayo Clinic, American College Gynecology, Society Maternal Fetal Medicine, agreed women get vaccinated fact they're pregnant put higher risk. However, CDC still hesitant give go ahead.

 
In August CDC recommended women get vaccine data safer data showing growing number women getting hospitalized Covid since unvaccinated.

 
The whole pregnant vaccination thing place pregnant women allowed medical studies. pregnant keeping published info whether get vaccine would ok getting January still working April women's health societies came seal (cause know they're beholden anyone, look data science make educated decisions women's health) approval. definitely appreciated. Especially time one district elementary schools literally protested group parents last year. thinks okay good idea protest fucking elementary school?? We're trying jobs care kids idiots. know get none try?  Anyone like probably find new job stealing cats.    really reminds news reports V Vendetta Well guess would reply job keep restaurant industry viable. imagine enough people like there, restaurant industry adapt. God also says enough people really really really want go back restaurants choices little outcome.  One cannot get away human sacrifice due religion one able put health others risk point death religion? refugees  restaurants go liquid menu straw requirements easy use mask long single use plastic ones /s  time joke bro. Yep, mean, cool quarantining lepers hole ground? know point commenting arguing. Whatever beliefs hold true going changed post stranger Reddit. approved treatment COVID, period. everyone expert everything, laypeople try play doctor end severe illness death. Indeed, well. Yes.  See ""Our Reliable Pandemic Number Losing Meaning"", references bottom proportion hospitalizations due severe COVID-19 changed vaccine availability, thus, increasing proportions mild asymptomatic cases included hospitalization reporting metrics. addition simple measures disease severity case definition SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization straightforward objective change improve value metric tracking SARS-CoV-2 disease burden.

Interestingly also found severity dropped vaccinated unvaccinated Among 47,742 admissions 38,508 unique patients laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, N=28,731 met criteria moderate-to-severe COVID-19. proportion moderate-to-severe disease prior widespread vaccine availability 64.0% (95% CI, 63.1-64.9%) versus 52.0% later period (95% CI, 50.9-53.2%), p-value non-constant effect, &lt;0.001. Disease severity vaccine era among hospitalized patients lower among unvaccinated (55.0%, 95% CI, 53.7-56.4%) vaccinated patients (42.6%, 95% CI, 40.6-44.8%). seems way. agree disagree. Great discussion anyways. Stay well friend. right landslide recall too. Higher taxes = stronger, well funded government = effective crisis response data link shows that..

I live Manitoba fool DC metro area past month seeing people shed masks stores.  sent 100 million bulletproof vests 100 million people get shot gun 50 ft distance, make it. Maybe manufacturing defect, sorts things would happen.

But far far far less people would die one wearing vest. conclusion draw ""So bulletproof vests work?""  There's probably it.

""There scientific basis potential therapeutic effect covid-19 pre-clinical studies""  Lol canada run 50% capacity, americans funny. individual's death that's cathartic viewers, confirmation we've known year still facing onslaught politically minded disinformation that's caused deluge death suffering.

If anti-mask/anti-vax disinformation machine still running strong via many ignorant groups individuals, it'd lot easier feel compassion featured videos. us still trying desperately protect close us pandemic, videos help confirm *we crazy following medical guidelines* believing established science saved millions fate videos display. ones? vaccinated universities know aren’t requiring masks. name ones mean?   tragic irony pregnant women unborn children die higher rate Texas elsewhere *because* freedom-boner politics used pass abortion restrictions... much already epilepsy want problems thankful vaccinated since April! long covid disagreement fundamental pivot point, think healthy 30 year olds lot lose next 40-50 years lives fundamentally altered lasting Covid sequela. There's also trade whether take responsibility protecting countries expense increased deaths home.

It may noble assert fewer deaths preferable deaths elsewhere. may revisit belief turns lose spouse parent ""unnecessary"" Covid death.

In Israel, at-risk vaccinated people filling hospitals starting die -- resulting concerted booster program nip early possible. attitude ""experts"" seem take. Israel what, one two months ahead us vaccination history?

It likely make decent case boost at-risk now, general population start problems. Science able track predict that. No, Satan pretty cool guy.

The virus like Christian god. studies conducted far concluded Ivermectin effective preventing treating covid-19.

To quote company manufactures -

""There scientific basis potential therapeutic effect covid-19 pre-clinical studies""

And that's straight horses mouth. vaccines significantly reduce chances getting infected. makes spreading people much less likely, since can’t spread disease you’re infected with.

And, yes, *rare* breakthrough cases, symptoms much less severe, average. Woah woah woah crazy talk. /s Hence comment. people saying types things interested facts.  believe number tahts you. problem urgently acquire relevant evidence prevent harm vulnerable populations immediate term, namely, winter's flu season.

Your ethical study even nearly meet need hand, relevant preventive issue hand, population sixty, *specifically addressed study above.* Healthy young adults constitute representative sample target population. (This already something problem initial studies approval; nevertheless, vaccines even administered older adults preferentially.) Therefore, study propose would useless establishing safety efficacy older groups, could done, peer-reviewed, published less year, time would even useless. 

So need studies like one, which, although controlled, urgent, flawed, full confounders, offers overwhelming evidence short-term goals met safely. Saying controlled, stating might skew outcome *in one direction,* misleading makes question agenda. whole lot United States well. me, third shot slightly worse second shot, second shot slightly worse first. take sick day work day third shot, would recommend getting done day day off. super easy schedule - much easier first two, actually. went CVS gave me.  Agreed.

Was intended argue said? Covid spreads easily hospitals, sympathy healthcare workers losing jobs refusal get vaccinated. lame. certainly respecting choice establishments protect people getting infected. saved life! preemptively... Thank much this! Curious hear this. source? US data UK test awful lot! PCR test whenever need LFTs readily available used high schools test pupils. rate hospitalisation children really low. also starting vaccinate 16s.  Great thought safe leave house vaccinated person…. Pfizer inoculation sticker? received ""seal"" vaccination card otherwise.  Nice see fellow Mahoning Valley resident. like 21 WFMJ though Again, thanks hard work. really pushing technology forward, really appreciate it. yeah, we've realized there's much do. I'm kind sad government pushing since oddly pro-government. Probably one reasons resisting :-/ Washington issues taking cases collapsed system Idaho. linked article explaining it. Washington rationed health care like Idaho Alaska. It’s “all I’ve got,” it’s things enrich life keep feeling like cog machine   state (Florida), CVS offering ""extra"" doses people self-identify immunocompromised, got booster last weekend. regret seem unethical since dozen appointments day... like can't *give* vaccine away know take anybody else's spot. That’s hell lot “significant exposure” windows away. Thank you!

Not sure downvotes - vaccines cooler pharmacy would go bad ways. kids ages 14-18, eligible vaccine even unvaccinated EXTREMELY unlikely get seriously sick die it. I’m endangering anymore parents endangering driving school letting play sports. That’s you’ve got, huh? buying stuff? actually love here. pretty isolated place stay ourselves. Actually, already need get pets vaccinated rabies, need annual testing. many cities actually need license local government proving you’ve done that. fuck wrong people? “Occasionally getting sick” really stupid way phrase potentially permanently maimed killed walked Walgreens got one. sorry keep rambling here, true people might actual allergies vaccine? example, heard people get EpiPen moderna, people get blood clots j&amp;j, etc.

that's kind meant. I'm afraid I'm overlooking something may make wrong decision. tried talking doctor seemed clueless vaccines seemed annoyed questions. mean, understand getting vaccinated important would've helped helped answer questions put fears rest work still making us weekly rotation keep social distance. 

We also masks soon vaccine mandate. Wish would drop distancing measures. 12 dying rare. many cases kids conditions? I’m sorry hear 

Don’t care bit unvaccinated adults trauma kids. ridiculous Nah, think it’s complete bullshit. even close. companies love engineers direct experience customers specs systems. also huge benefit someone knows people within company. joined nursing subreddit recently curiosity things going child recently started nursing school. parent simultaneously immensely proud choosing path moment time also completely terrified. perspective, roles may appear reversed - you, like you, attacking family attempting force take brand-new vaccine they're scared of

I want force take vaccine. want vaccine required interact mine. think absurd online schooling instead them, they're scared simple requirement disease they're convinced big deal.

And way change mind enough die publicly visible fashion possible. Hence desire spread videos. 

I think also glossing important HOWs here. people get lead astray? made fertile targets charlatans? makes attack things like mask mandates, scary.. inconvenient. 

These people culpability fooled. arrogance selfishness mistrust anything fit echochamber made targets first place. 

Consider, moment, fact necessarily think masks great deal either, wear anyway helps others little worth it. could wrong. cost anything minor annoyance annoyance worth bit help might give. 

These people avoiding vaccine think might dangerous, avoiding, often aggressively, possible inconvenience much selfish.  yeah cases gonna blow up, honestly 5k cases day deaths still pretty low. might low enough keep living life winter tbh quarantine. technology. Like said, keep up. full scale lockdown 2 years. full scale lockdown couple months depending state. 9 states lockdowns March June, Cali, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas City (Not whole state), Mass., Michigan, New York, Oregon Wisconsin. California state 2nd lockdown 12-07 12-28. Every state open. Sure states restrictions, lockdowns businesses forced closed non-essential.

These things like closing schools, non food/doctor/drug stores, non essential production, cancellation venus public places, curfews stay-at-home orders. answer no, United States cannot handle another 30 days. getting stimulus checks unemployment benefits.

 think completely missing point areas high vaccination tend lower infection rates. Another huge thing love ignore Breakthrough deaths, huge part getting vaccinated. deal people spreading virus give cold like symptoms. cannot deal people spreading virus already killed hundreds thousands Americans millions world wide. cannot find stats unvaccinated vs vaccinated deaths, unvaccinated 8-10 times likely die. need vaccine, honestly idea anti-vax, disappointing. 

Your solution lockdown, sure it'll work lower spread bit, eradicate it. vaccine manages it, stop variants able happen infection overall helps make things back normal. total cases per 100k residents highest unvaccinated areas. seeing that?  


I imagine mostly &lt; 6m age actually bulk 0-4's getting sick? 'Free will' double-edged sword.

Like Force ductape, light side dark side. bad too, then. Forgive me, I'm used defensive people twisting things I've said. got recently siblings I'm pissed want send dad concert he's unvaccinated. I'm worried he'll contract covid make it. Acc siblings makes ""obsessed death"" 



I'm fucking goth ""take grave, world pointless"" put seatbelt on. Question... fully vaccinated two doses Pfizer mid-summer. Recently, (not all) Covid symptoms. Sharp headache, earache sore throat. whole episode lasted two weeks. 
For reasons go here, able get tested four weeks symptoms started. eventually got nasal swab, results negative. 
The question is, indeed contracted Covid (no sure thing) vaccine presumably job fought off, would test four weeks later still identify remnants virus system four week interval enough time virus longer show test? 
I'm asking question hopes someone link reputable article study addressed question similar - something seen myself, hence I'm asking. Reading eating huge bowl food. spew statistics. Woo-hoo. background including manipulate them. raw data add up. Try again. Regurgitate numbers want, still wrong. blows mind. extremes sides. really fascinating think about. Long term effects: raising generation children grow pre-existing conditions COVID. Healthcare system next 20-40 years going FUCKED. [I may super symptom COVID. would get COVID test. necessarily specific COVID articles implied. occurs diseases well.
Here's CDC groups positive negative test results, congestion runny nose strong associations new loss taste smell, suggesting latter may valid marker test positivity sample.  quite; J&amp;J viral vector - modified adenovirus grow COVID spikes. Sinovac Sinopharm inactivated viral vaccines: actual sars-cov-2 viruses inactivated (killed) can’t replicate injected Yes are. I’m nursing subreddit burnout awful. someone actually explain means? Layman thinks going people say vaccines booster shot.

So efficacy actually drops 36% 12 months mean something else? know easier survive initial infection? two-dose COVID vaccine. 

Of 179+ million people received vaccine US, 14,000 died.

Of 42+ million confirmed infections US, 677,000+ died. 

I would say odds better shot not. reason reason enough, it’s personal choice. updated version vaccines better enough justify using instead original vaccine, far.

Also, vaccines dampen genomic diversity covid, previous infection. somehow still circulating year two, it'll :

1. really mild disease immunity 

2. Boosting immunity count it. FDA made clear they're opposed ethical grounds, plan dismiss studies except ones averaged months delta earliest vaccinated reaching 5-6 months say effectiveness ""still"" high. plan say data saying otherwise observational, holds little value meaning ""no evidence"" spend next 6-12 months conducting formal trials, let hospitalizations elderly pile effectiveness severe disease already 80% July according CDC study.... 90 average May June! High!

The worst part actually try quantify benefit world, boosters would amount couple weeks current output, maybe 3 gave young healthy too. they're making noble sacrifice save millions speed rollout months. they're certainly prepared obliterate reputation like are. Also engineer. I’m confused incredibly smart coworkers friends don’t know science is. don’t know approach subject without bias. One guy best expansive technical documentation I’ve ever seen. asked explain meant said follow science masks ineffective COVID nothing worry literally sent YouTube link dickhead showing videos people wearing masks various things saying scared fearful are. got here:  Man adhd felt much worse since exposed covid March 2020 like 25 cases state. it’s hard know much worse daily life even medicated. try read things get impatient like “Ugh. many words. Get point” I’m always tired matter what. could fall asleep middle day matter much sleep get. Everything feels like Herculean effort. still work time I’m nothing left give hobbies. That’s it’s like live adhd every day people think it’s made up. Add covid it’s worse also impossible distinguish it’s normal state. much latitude declarations give hospitals? allowed blanket rule someone COVID symptoms unvaccinated, less 20% beds free, turned away (or whatever percentage would needed prevent others impacted)? wish stopped reading ""vaccines finite good,"" wrong is, rest even worse.

Cheerio. mean.. see people afraid technocracy  England, Germany Israel currently giving boosters.

But FDA.  wanted abuse service workers more. I’ve worked healthcare almost two decades. Pretty much every vaccine existence already mandated. fda approval nurses quitting fuck right far I’m concerned. stupid get science need leave anyway.  easy say care restaurants theatre anymore age. I'll assume I'm twice age, given mentioned college. means perspective bit different. fair experiences want. Covid created condition. see that. over, experience life want. me, certain things longer concern never again. Again, perspective. also probably bit copium that's changed thinking things. knows.   feel like companies need pushing vaccines booster bc lot poorer countries 5% vaxxed less Yeah, people crazy reason shit getting worse rather better. obviously they've never seriously sick. Dysautonomia (still largely controlled) 5 years totally disabled. ""Long Covid"" post-viral Dysautonomia many people get better. 

Death negative outcome far, can't necessarily tell going end long-term health issues. Plenty otherwise healthy people can't walk across houses without getting breath year ""recovering"" Covid. I'm going everything power end like again. 

It really, really sucks think probably never go back ""normal"" get people want consider it, signs pointing way since near beginning denial going change it. well, lease terminated either side. You’re favor landlord access medical records? Lol point, since unvaccinated don’t giving flying f&amp;$&amp; society, let’s go money. don’t want want insurance costs go ignorant aren’t vaccinated let pay all. Delta Airlines could go unvaccinated pay increased premium, take away employer funded insurance unvaccinated. lot rn Florida, people avoiding medical care, skipping cancer treatments, unable get surgery. common knowledge getting medical care dental care currently puts high risk infection. see serious breakthrough infections, people feel safer skip medical care time being. Seems like everyone anything people getting infected.  everyone make calculus. me, still plenty things allow live getting sick. We're locked I'd like rest life, I'm definitely reevaluating really miss. say everyone covidiots get put headlocks asked “Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, Astra Zeneca!?” let go take pick get jabbed.  Fucking idiots. Keep taking horse dewormer you’re full horse shit. ""first know allergic reactions blood clots, else going learn future know know now""

They actually know allergic reactions. discovered approval process. blood clots rare happen approval study, soon discovered, J&amp;J vaccine paused eleven days learned identify treat effects. year since approval studies done, sure there's nothing new learn. Vaccine side-effects never, point history, arisen beyond three month mark. is.  glasses Nobody making anyone homeless. He’s giving option. Get vaccinated don’t move property doesn’t require vaccinations. much different employer requiring staff vaccinated. Delta evade antibodies created current vaccines, there's really benefit developing delta-specific vaccine. reason Delta starting infection people got vaccinated five moths ago replicates rapidly sinuses, antibody levels already high, become symptomatic and/or contagious body make enough antibodies clear infection.  Exactly. stock doses gently recommend people get them, people don’t, throw away. going continue strategy foreseeable future. Putting arms better putting garbage, that’s real choice here. people talking boosters taking shots away poor countries making shit up. don’t know ideal time get booster yet. currently isn’t sufficient concern overall efficacy existing vaccine regimen. possible stunt future potential immunity re-vaccinating ideal time so. don’t want re-vaccinate everyone find out, oops, waited another 6-8 months.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  “study” posted literally survey parents. 

There also 0 control group there’s actually way self reported “long Covid” symptoms could attributed literally anything. 

Closure schools quarantining away friends going serious mental health issues kids, obviously.

“Health Ministry survey finds 30% long-term effects cognitive, mental health issues, cautions also attributed lockdowns, school closures, war”


“However, statement cautioned without control group, effects could definitively attributed virus, noting effects prolonged lockdowns, school closures, Israel’s May conflict Hamas, thousands rockets fired civilians, could also affected children’s well-being.

It also noted survey relied self-reporting diagnoses doctors.”

Real hard hitting study there. saw one entry HCA woman lost son Covid, said there's big battle going Heaven God called son could fight God's army astral war.

What. The. Fuck. Lady.    Ya I'm bit antsy well. I'm quickly approaching 6 month mark much want wait CDC's recommendation, I'm definitely weighing getting booster anyway. Talk doctor. Vermont, Alaska next followed North Dakota. people.that live rural areas.... I'm going lie like I'm worried getting sick... would probably pull through. long take care father, I'll taking whatever shots they're offering they're comfortable kill me.

So I'm going jump front someone else's syringe, sure heck signing booster soon get ""legitimate"" one locally. [Crazification (alternatively known ""Keyes constant"") neologism coined 2005 blogger screenwriter John Rogers refer portion electorate comprising nuttiest wingnuts batshit crazy, least diehard partisans.

Rogers writing 2004 Senate election vs. Alan Keyes. Keyes state, eliminate established political base; candidates black, factor racism; Keyes plainly, obviously, completely crazy. Batshit crazy. Head-trauma crazy. 27% population Illinois voted him. put party identification, personal prejudice, whatever ahead rational judgement. Hell, even like 5% Democrats voted him. That’s crazy behaviour. think assume 27% crazification factor population.” Thank that. Best wishes well. sent wife home yesterday. Normally, would given antibiotic drip room called Rxs apologized to. WA myIRmobile validates vaccination via state registery. believe several states well. Yes worries! allergies Im relatively healthy age (early 40s). ahead curve covid19, luckily support wife, even became big thing US. fortunate enough bleeding edge protecting ourselves, family, anyone around us isn’t preventative. 

Thanks asking wish well Vid19 things. Also: Allergies suck!!! kids allergic pollen grass. feel bad them. side would say 1 500 inflated Counting pneumonia conditions best conspiracy theory: *ever noticed many us anti-vaxx activists dying COVID? What's going on?!* They’re criminals. wrong called racist actions took early 2020. Totally agree. Trump Fauci also restrictive enough stopping/quarantining coming country time.  

You're right above. However, ""every Democrat saying take vaccine"".  one taking vaccine EUA Don’t get shot then?  agree it’s dangerous. Simultaneously it’s dangerous allow type mentality work patients, potentially making everything worse. Ahh yes, classic far right defense. sharing toothbrush letting stranger sleep bed you, can't say someone able hold 50 housing units name purposes extracting value others return nothing! 

Absurd. Everyone entitled primary residence. Even someone currently landlord. That's entire point argument. I'm also entitled primary residence, I'm also person. "
