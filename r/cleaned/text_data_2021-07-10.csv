0,2021-07-10," incidence rate heart inflammation vaccination like .0000001 percent setting crazy low like that. There's around 250 reported cases. exponentially likely get heart inflammation covid regardless age health status 3rd wave caused delta variant. starting make impact now. Okay, rules rules, gets compete. sure hell think offered endorsement deals. obviously care community's health safety. Wait sharted threw ice top? many died?  I'll say again... Insurance companies need step in. vaccine, coverage. happened then? No, told went party. Everyone supposed get test it. One person lied everyone caught it. pissed. way spoke. 

I say better gym. mean wore mask whole time adapted. would walk around around chins. Thankfully go 24/7 gym would go less people there. /r/iamverybadass Happening Spain right What’s end game here?


We it: /r/collapse Well I'll be... 

Last time I'll getting behind dumpster shart vax place.

That checks though.. leave frosty. blame government opening early face Delta, fuck think would happen, testing system 100% full proof. country run morons.  literally response comment kids 12 become eligible. Context. doses expire soon need injected extremely quickly? Oh, tell us more. source, present information source report it. So, gonna ignore honest news watch news country platform. Dropping sets public gym might've culprit. sitting changing positions certainly *does not* decrease pain. horrible inaccurate.

Maybe specific case, [classic distinct features tendency decrease intensity patient sits leans forward. position (seated, leaning forward) tends reduce pressure parietal pericardium, particularly inspiration.  Initial viral exposure isn’t thing. don’t feel sick Covid it’s spreading long time. Exactly right. Better retain minimal restrictions (masks indoors) open 100% close again. Sir Wendy’s. Come 90. strong gust wind could killed her.   That's point issue. 

When people sitting wondering whether get vaccine they're worried outlier, small percentage might affected. Yeah people died India spreading uncontrollably lack treatment oxygen. virus much worse. still bit time till reach YET. definitely acting though. adults refusing get vaccinated. Maybe let kids antivaxxers attend school parents show proof vaccination. Prepare fast forward... tests (antigen) also valid 40 hrs old get club.

The recomendation ""test events"" test everyone 5 days event, apparently enforcing difficult.  know well. say wore mask properly.  would heavy set would drop set put right after. also said worked throughout it. Man hope wasn’t f1 euros know blocking doesn’t silence prevent responding comment. bought enough vaccines bet wrong ones waiting longer. what’s happening NSW nothing like what’s happening Netherlands Wait.. guys get sharted ?

I knew place seemed little off... Delta India. Brazil P1 called Gamma now. super uncomfortable breathe them. I've worn quite long time, find exhausting. would like see practice revoked travel again. right, people know vaccines work, one them.

It true still transmit covid vaccinated, however, chances contracting first place massively reduced. Therefore, vaccinated person inherently less likely transmit covid unvaccinated person they're resistant contracting it. vaccine, therefore, protects around you, too.

You can't give covid someone else first place. essence herd immunity.

Educate stop spreading misinformation. state that? California? actively killing. purposed, accidental. paths take tm Yrah be. starts getting better youre good Libertarianism work 5% population personality type completely responsible independent. rest tribe depends others survival strong leadership. see angered someone. Remembering last year traumatic thing, get it. still talk distrust well came out, many antivaxers Covid one. personally show hesitance towards vaccines prior, planning getting moment available? still going gym lockdown? lower last wave didn’t vaccines. reason high incredible vaccines guys realize unvaccinated people also get hospitalized right? Obviously vaccine works general there's something strange people subreddit always talking dumb anti-vaxxers love drawing conclusions anecdotes. Best luck tomorrow then! would get chicken pox vaccine exposed already? Decades experience research say provides essentially life long immunity. (Not counting shingles).

I doubt single doctor would recommend getting it.

But SARS-COV-2 completely different. way worse catch, immunity seem wane (especially natural immunity), reinfection/breakthrough cases common also rare .   Absolutely not.

The covid vaccines approximately 95% effective preventing covid infection. Point contradiction ""narrative"". specific, I'll wait.

Fools refusing vaccinated causing deaths every single day pandemic. absolutely right go science remain unvaccinated.  Max said, beginning, may need booster. surprise anyone?? scientific reason vaccinated people wearing masks.  take authors word, conclude near impossibility engaged practice science.

I feel like mixing possibility probability falsification, good hypothesis requires former latter. antitheses easy prove right would know much anything, easiness proving antithesis irrelevant. Yeah rough, heal eventually. Heart super healthy took while. Yeah did. told correct conjecture misrepresented saying. told big deal unable articulate thoughts defend points made, independent anything authors said. me? No, I'm perfectly healthy otherwise.  Required how? Like school, job, general population?

If mean school/job, it’s possible, would likely challenged courts system. mean general public? highly, highly doubt it.  that's I'm wearing mask forever. Go doctor investigate what's going endemicity.   50 health problems, small chance get seriously ill COVID itself. bother vaccine? caught vaccine. Well young people see problem all. likely government let children infected without vaccine waste money getting people low risk vaccinated. chances catching transmitting virus MASSIVELY reduced vaccinated.

Each vaccine affect one single person. article showing numbers percentage full population, rather eligible population. never miss opportunity claim movement one direction leads slippery slope hell. increase 2000% less tha 2 weeks even, close 500 one point. Australia supposedly transmission two people walking past other. impossible saw twice security cameras catch Wat u meen screenshot qr code can’t reason someone position didn’t reason into. go again. ever going over? I'm starting think answer no.  US like ""Hold beer"" Absolutely. would go propose locking again. can't risk it. literally told getting first done may ther booster point thought safe, assumed people around well. people faked QR codes fucked up, people told newly vaxxed people clubbing safe (the government) fucked up. time need normalcy again, try trust people telling us possible right, every day lonely day makes harder us keep isolation going ourselves. exactly trolley problem though. choice rather either let die actively kill them. released UK, experience (larger population) Delta variant anywhere else functioning public health get Delta variant (the first part report original virus). seeing 79% effectiveness preventing symptomatic disease Delta variant Pfizer AZ vaccines. Effectiveness hospitalization 96%. 

I've never able get images work reploy, here's link image page report: add mandatory quarantining people we've afflicted last 16 months Wait, what? mask requirement planes stopping going somewhere? Masks hurt you, promise. face fall anything. far bad. Mild moderate cough, pain breathing. I'm 4 days since symptoms first started, understand day 5 usually worst. fair, population Iceland much smaller easier get majority population vaxxed sooner. There's probably quite lot public shaming country small word gets around sooner. also dense packed Netherlands socially introverted overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, vaxxed mean get COVID 100% obviously. fully vaxxed couple last month traveled Iceland tested positive 5th day quarantine. Irony due Iceland's updated changes, even test vaxxed. actually surprised US explored yet Don’t blame people government’s woefully incompetent decision making. People always take much given chance. 

I know ‘personal responsibility’ big thing Netherlands, solely blame government, anyone half bran cell could seen coming, Rutte posse farts too. He's waffling back forth better part year lot things. He's love TV. know that. 100% immune.

Press release said almost 100% cases today LA County unvaccinated. Yes breakthrough case, yes vaccinated still carry cases unvaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

LA public country twitter (5th Lol   He's faker Dr Phil Third dose?   I’m sick right covid symptoms. Cough chills sore throat head ache school kids stay home another going problems. 

Not parent. I’m vaxxed pro-science. I’ve watched friends family kids go hell. kids fucking DONE.  Vaccine doesn’t prevent getting virus prevents getting sick enough need admitted hospital. That’s 9X% number, always been. It’s working well something like 98% people hospital 99% people died covid last months unvaccinated. mean numbers super far CDCs numbers US deaths. Yeah seems slightly skewed lower, far enough explained differences counting methodologies. ""The pattern visible India really different data coming countries; says infection relatively less common among children, mostly affects adult population. Elderly people, comorbidities, higher risk developing severe form disease""

The right mentioned India, Indonesia Missouri

One like others. Missouri significant percentage population vaccinated. Especially vulnerable mentioned, Delta getting started US. Missouri's hospitalizations within weeks, even portion state vaccinated

And hospitalizations deaths get last surge might start get concerned. developed Leiden, Janssen Belgian company… Agreed sense yes, technically, correct definition pandemic meaning issue one country mean pandemic over, article Canada response specifically. Locally, end, likely come far technical pandemic worldwide. Restrictions based realities country affect, world large. ""Blue collar""
""Trump""

Man... really living crazy timeline.  Would say enforcement pass still high? i'm confused this. pediatric trial double blind study? know child got vaccine? Hence still wear mask shops disinfect hands cart. gonna stop feel safe.   500 million consider inflation (of population). Flu still 100x. Dude come on. You’re ignorant you?

“if someone dies COVID-19, counting COVID-19 death,” 
-	Dr. Deborah Birx

That means die car accident test positive it’s covid death. It’s died covid FROM. point I’ve seen dozens articles pure overdoses covid deaths, car accidents, falls, whatever. Cdc average number comorbidities 4.6. 

Listen yourself. “We’ve taken liberal approach counting Apparently they're clueless kind damage covid lungs. Canadian here.. I’ve always thought should’ve started kids youth, worked upwards age. spread least likely follow guidelines.

First vaccinated person Canada lady old folks home Quebec. recently died old age. 🤷🏼‍♂️  Dude, said ""we all,"" means talking everyone. Absolutely right move. Especially given booster focused groups seem slipping cracks. got vaccine part group still contracting COVID ending hospitalized. anything booster general population would reserved variant vaccine truly much less effective (under 50%). 

There also chance vaccine become yearly variants continue are. Thankfully though overall side effect profile vaccines get better improve them.

This gen I, work, side effects. Gen II probably focus keeping efficacy improving side effects. fully believe matures get better it’s uses widen past vaccines.

We’re suffering first generation issues. Like new MacBook redesigns, first year always rough. read paper, based ""mostly hard evidence leak natural origins common"". cover lot reasons virus leaking WIV actually highly implausible. Well ask knew going third wave didn’t know it’s one wave sharks freaking laser beans attached head Yes, business demand supply. sucks man, get well soon!! last affordable medical care industrialized countries. Yeah, like think masks required year, really always thing healthcare especially winter. imagine GP's office. go cold, certainly leave one. data many cases vaccinated vs not??? one get?? don’t mind asking Gross. private business private business.

Awesome. unfortunately private businesses still allow unvaccinated

FTFY. Ireland strictest lockdown Europe. ￼It popular perfect, took toll, right policy known time. friend dealing residual bronchitis/ sinusitis like nearly month now. He's mostly still 100% suggesting someone designed virus lab knew would infect humans, actually infect humans, figured animal would infect, infected animal, end goal infecting humans?

I'm pretty sure happen. Unless full vaccination provides 100% immunity single dose provides 0% immunity, word ""need"" instance entirely subjective.

We already know receiving doses reduces risk, amount risk reduction considered necessity? Well yeah shit. roughly 5% vaccinated people exposed covid got Covid. 0.04% doesn’t account fact people aren’t exposed covid. really think you’re mistaken Hmm. Pfizer? probably unit abbreviation wrong - it’s 25 micrograms (so 1/4 adult dose). MRNA vaccines, primary vaccine US, work targeting spike protein lose almost effectiveness, COVID evolved away spike protein mechanism infection period. argued non-insignificant portion medical professionals evolves away spike protein ability infect cells period goes way becomes something else entirely. Mutating completely different virus/organism pretty much beyond evolutionary limits coronaviruses strong internal error checking. think assuming facts evidence. Well couple issues that. 

1) looking genius level people work there. Easy attract smart capable people work oil rig remote island?

2) researching emerging infectious diseases rule come populated areas, hard physically removed areas. would kinda like researching sports medicine Antarctica...not much work on. probably rather sports medicine research facility next football stadium. 

3) would mean constantly transporting potentially highly infectious material long distances. 

I believe standard research BSL 3 laboratory understanding accounts issues might worry about. Pfizer one running clinical trials, gathering data, making recommendation based data CDC/FDA. thing agencies mad fact Pfizer didn’t call making announcement.

Fun fact don’t need too. announced would seeking permission third dose based clinical trials they’re currently doing. it.

Further CDC FDA can’t “decide” third dose isn’t necessary without providing documented reasons, data, analysis backs said decision.

Should Pfizer probably picked phone heads announcement? Absolutely. law legal reason to? Nope.

Even still whole situation really argument semantics wether company freedom speech. decided decades ago something called Citizens United. Real great ruling kinds unforeseen issues. entire family vaccinted also got covid , today day 8 quarantine preety much recovered except loss smell ""Stronger immune system"" (which already poorly defined) works covid would posit few. 

I think due limited desire engage critical thinking regarding available data.  need justify leases they’ve paid offices. OMT say this? I've wanting hear countries' public health teams saying, since Ireland extremely conservative we've postponed opening indoor dining, yet many others removed masks opened clubs. **Jul. 11, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Good point. think one through. Oh, guy basing arguments from? try different source.

We don’t HIV vaccine mutates damn fast (and attacks immune system directly). didn’t provide argument assertion primary goal vaccines reduce infections. That’s wrong know it. Considering bad vaccine (unscientificly) would guess could seriously harmed. curiosity back 100% now? P-BNT Moderna approved 12+ US Canada, doubt there's scientific reason UK. citation 99.9% claim? well, minority portion backwards tbh. worse cause bunch leadership certain party downplaying pandemic. too! I've seen several articles attorneys say uncertain terms 100% legal employer require Covid vaccine condition employment. That's arnt enough self driving cars there. Aaand that's wrap comments, like post Southern state title.  Get vaccinated first ""Spanish"" Flu (which actually originated Fort Riley, Kansas) 1918 [THREE occurred largely everyone assumed woods safe return normal. 

The whole documentary worth watching IMO. Try follow states covid-19 response resources isolation testing. want tested soon possible make known were.

Realistically isolate 10 days neither symptoms, 14 days do. there's means tested remotely (somebody coming door whatever states test trace policy is) immediately, advised next steps this. Dont worry much, one things we'll get used traveling sadly! suggested take virology 101 Professor Vincent Racaniello youtube.  free course learn virology. course, tell need one vaccine smallpox polio last lifetime cannot find one HIV stuffs mentioned basic virology. still get virus vaccine. 95% common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 **about hundred times less that: 0.04%.** mild flu symptoms mild COVID gonna give long term effects mild? Also death good symptom live please get vaccinated curiosity think Pfizer vaccine efficacy was? google “Moderna vaccine efficacy” Moderna might fully vaccinated. ""Spanish"" Flu (which actually originated Fort Riley, Kansas) [THREE occurred largely everyone assumed woods safe return normal. 

The whole documentary worth watching IMO. Romania rest Europe gotten low infection rates confusing me. Ireland much higher vaccine uptake tougher restrictions, yet since June we've one highest case levels. Lots reddit socially inept/awkward. They'd gladly love ringing endorsement antisocial behavior ""saving lives"" Dutch Americans Europe. episode talk interviewing virologists?  insurance companies stop paying FDA gives full approval one vaccines. meantime, hope private employers saying ""no vaccine, job."" delta ""out control"" Israel?  attention devoted claims SARS-CoV-2 genetically engineered adapted cell culture “humanized” animal models promote human transmission57.

This answers question: exactly mean anything?

which summarized people argued COVID optimal human infection, designed passaged human cells optimum argument laid statement virus continuing become optimal pandemic continues. expect virus already artificially optimized.

You enlightened.

If questions go beyond text, take authors. feel like time trials get approval delta rear view mirror (and driving right omega something.) Seems hard stay top it… Read said stop assuming meant.

I assume excess deaths covid. Statistically excess deaths accounted for, trends hold YOY part.

I gave examples example show excess deaths means.

If 5k excess expected course covid. say 2k account 3k well either way fact still stands: 5k people died year timeframe year prior trend 5 years back.

It mean covid, fact people putting surgeries due covid could dying immature example.

That still largely indirect consequence covid still.   qualified, accomplished, college educated candidate running him. Instead, re-elect Governor Hee Haw never spent day sort higher education 20 percentage points. landed ass-first job previous guy blackmailed mistress photos basement sex dungeon. guy running senate.

I hate state. really doesn't. Interesting 12 hospital admissions: makes wonder blip track trace program. Sinovac recipient Malaysia (no allowed choose one get), feel frustration.  flu seasons worse others. don’t need third dose. I'm confused. vaccinated? Interesting adjustment standards “statistically poses harm” “a number [suspected] vaccine-related deaths”. Either “a number” counts doesn’t. absolutely children hospitalised killed due Covid, underlying conditions particularly vulnerable. Thanks man, thinking serious condition due vaccinated. Lets hope take get though. Take care brother :) run specialist medical practice Sydney even know many GPs telling older patients ""wait Pfizer""! 99% time contraindications AZ (which rare). 

No doubt we'll many deaths poor advice given. I've fuming months!! Yeah like

law order!!!

But also:

You can’t make wear mask!!!

Pussies 😂 Delta variant cold-like symptoms. Better get tested. Mine Hong Kong A4 sized piece paper ... thought everyone got vaccinated! Hospitals still treat people without insurance. hospitals treat send massive bill that’s get negotiated written hospitals don’t actually expect anyone pay 6 figure bill.

Even though think happen, don’t think would solve much. allowed part Every person know homeschooled socialization issues. terrible children isolate peers. I've got sack knob can’t sleep side directly back anymore this. sleep stomach get relief. It’s frustrating. city testing pretty much stopped course numbers look great. dad stroke moderna. Natural immunity less risk pseudo virus cleaving spike proteins causing heart inflammation. let’s listen fearmongerers right? friends tested positive vaccinated too? would guess factor age demographics population change. Hence canary coal mine. Hopefully states take heed what’s happening FL, one thing Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama, lots people country vacationing FL right now, might bring Delta back enclaves unvaccinated. MCAS

Ok, thanks warning.

I hope feel better soon. Good luck! don’t understand barely anyone dying. 32 deaths 24,000 new cases.  Obviously lag crazy.  wonder explains it.  CA schools already require proof vaccines (not covid). Collecting proof Covid vaccine would difficult. Get flu shot. never start with, gonna see much destroy lungs guess. cost fallacy

No benefit outweigh cost start over. would nice surrounded smarter people, worth giving pension over. point? Yoga always bunch unscientific, esoteric nonsense peddled woo merchants.

In experience tend left-leaning though, definitely Q-followers. nope suicides, everyone theorized would happen, didn't.

Now, overdoses definitely up.

My large, populated county looks like went substantially percentage-wise. But, went 23 deaths 33 deaths. county shutdown, bars stayed open. Clubs mostly stayed open. So, drug overdoses go up?

Honestly, feel like part subsidies extra unemployment money. people, money they'd ever around here. People afford use regularly could suddenly afford more. AND, no, think good idea give people money avoid 10 additional people die drug overdoses. definitely would suicides.

My county anything depressed cause believe pandemic real shutdown OD's went much areas shutdowns..

Either maybe bad quality drugs got sold typical year? basically. either ""get it"" from/with vaccine get without vaccine guess hypothesis. much evidence really require though? well established initial dose virus often correlates severity infection. matter public record vaccines tested social distancing masking, least larger extent today, certainly case mentioned. Also, infectious variants exist vaccines tested. makes sense - like vaccinated gain invisible shield airways prevents virus, matter exposure, ever getting body. one claims case.... many people think 'I vaccinated therefore virus somehow magically bounce body'... work like that. government tell us OK stop wearing masks? reason that.. Everybody joining Delta Delta Fool Depends conformation change spike schools even allowed mask requirements Texas? New York’s big also, get excelsior pass app, nice. Well expected. That's self-defense mechanism. ego allow see wrong they've been. least life serve warning others. It’s crazy one’s talking it! mentioned friend said thing! Didn’t tell going thought panic attacks. fact millions young children delayed speech development learn reading lips adults wearing masks majority lives point?

I suppose thing care kid age group. Yes. MCAS.  People say never actually asian countries. False. colleges so. Natural immunity works covid. Moderna? Also probably tens thousands people died non covid issues healthcare system collapsing. Medical bankruptcy might knock sense them. talking pcp. edited comment. normal ecg. merely inquired person left comment indicating know bit heart inflammation, wondering way left field thinking could ask doctor thoughts are. doesn’t work Saturdays. Nah, yet. Give months. NSW Health confirmed woman 90s south west Sydney died yesterday Liverpool Hospital. Chief health officer Kerry Chant said believed woman vaccinated.



Agreed. important seniors complications exempt taking vaccine get jabbed. Over-70s eligible months, got late March would've fully vaccinated AZ weeks ago. look positive test rates. think US great job testing. r/averageredditor play devil's advocate here, vaccines readily available everyone us, months now. risk havn't vaccinated yet, people would say you. bat died hospitalized Correction: Unvaccinated hospitalized patients say regret getting shot seeing hospital bills. Use phone...take photo.  second worry much :) live swamp unfortunately least visiting lol First didnt want close businesses. get people would oppose that, necessary evil one knew anything virus time, needed way curtail spread research done.

Then order allow businesses start reopening safely, people told wear masks (this literally least could done help save lives), yet still refuse inconvenience slightest order SAVE LITERAL LIVES!

Finally vaccine produced would allow things begin returning normal even proved difficult task some.

Pretty sure child got camp took masks eat lunch separated 6 feet. think indians purpose. see back 35,000 cases? conclude inconclusive... back!  Take notes Greg Abbott Get Swiss cheese, American cheese method. Let’s process data hard doesn’t resemble thing it’s supposed represent. anyone saying California “isn’t following science” point regard overall point holes

- Kids around 7th Grade opportunity get vaccinated Pfizer kids can’t get vaccinated all. Couple fact lot parents hesitant vaccinate kids likely means kids need mask don’t 

- vast majority people making aforementioned claim also advocating schools going completely maskless absolutely farthest away “following science”. Reminds Anti-Vaxxers demanding Gov. Newsom drop mask mandate early (he didn’t end) claiming wasn’t “following science” people intended drop mask unvaccinated, absolute opposite “the science” said. Absolutely hypocritical 

- way 100% go accordance CDC guidelines would implement vaccine verification system would hassle, would even controversial polices place now. makes sense California take cautious route careless route even they’re line CDC

- statistically nearly impossible children die COVID can’t confidently said Long COVID risk even transmissibility (especially comes teenagers). Plus also risk potential variants popping outbreaks become rampant 9/11? I'm surprised authority execute post haste. think Fiji lost game jerseys? played Blacks…..

Sorry country much trouble. must frustrating see what’s happening able stop it.  Well actual daily testing rate state 1/3 beginning year. I'm sure people willing visit doctor dedicated quick testing site Romania less 25% fully vaccinated. I’m sure we’re alone. hasn’t lack vaccine availability several months now. better get rid mask mandate ASAP. Sitting plane summer already miserable enough. Add mask restricts body's ability expel heat asking lots cases heat exhaustion even heat stroke.

I fly regularly work I'm fully vaccinated, yet still wear fucking mask plane. BS. I've made sure airline fly knows want mask mandate lifted ASAP.

If think I'm whining, real problem, encourage dress head-to-toe full industrial PPE stand hot sun 10+ hours wearing mask. Maybe get small taste many us invisible people endure. recent surge surge fall? people vaccinated not? straight forward discussion I've suffered life second dose. unbelievably strong. Knowing sides effect, impressed much showed potential. wonder would reacted contracted covid. I've given moderna.

Edit : spelling child's private school open year state public schools person learning April. sure still require masks. #RedPill goes south Denialism. case. Two words. also exponentially people conservative people you’d think What?

It's gaslighting say every young man experiencing chest pains heart palpitations suffering myocarditis?

I've literally experienced symptoms young man. Turned anxiety related. someone concerned symptoms, go GP ER try get clear answer. like 90% Delta. Good luck achieving anywhere.  someone smarter help one? bad. Hear out:

1. people highest risk developing severe case vaccinated Netherlands. People aged 60+, people conditions, overweight people. rest people process vaccinated month.

2. people spreading virus right young people (Assuming vaccinated people spread virus much). far know, risk lower young people.

3. established fully vaccinated person still get covid, severity less bad. far know, also case Delta type.

I conclude folllowing happening:

A bunch people getting sick, end hospital, either young fully vaccinated. Meaning *in theory* noone really dying, right? case reopening?

Please explain seems everyone wants virus totally go away (which unrealistic imo), instead preventing people dying (which case right now). missing? yes, proven. Wait rule? mean? Thanks. didn’t realise low age easily done. 

My kid going four. can’t wait approval age, it’ll ages. :( Please forget like many others forum similar ones lockdowns non-medical interventions place two reasons only. 

1.prevent health systems overwhelmed way people need care able get one. 
2.prevent excess deaths. 

Anything else theatrical signalling government right thing voter wants right thing. best approach sit wait hospitalisations rise. do, always use time machine implement measurements months before. almost entirely 30s happening week two clubs opened again.

You simply can't say lets keep everything closed bad actors. cases 200 per day, open point fuck would ever open up?? Everyone 12 get vaccinated, need appointment, show random vaccination center you’re 20 minutes. Keep protecting loved ones. Educate them, let know far over.  Yes.

The paper also reports low protection (46%) Beta (SA variant) double vaccinated people Pfizer (but strong variants). Some1 said Holland Texas europe.  Exactly, that's I'm saying. nightclubs fucked hard. Slowclap government. also extremely pro free-speech guy, gotta admit, ideas worth discussing anymore. discussing wastes everyone's time also gives legitimacy.

My worry decides ideas worth discussing. certainly trust Facebook that.  Putting Conn Foxconn. Packed stands max Verstappen fans go probably help. Masks worked schools. kept mask mandates indoors.

I understand political pressure removed restrictions step wise. guess EXTREMELY small subset population cares this. 
You want protect got jabbed. 
There refuse get shot. 
Maybe got vaccinated ALSO care protecting others, I’d guess main reason help first. 
Sure see examples people claim want help immunosuppressed family member stay safe, I’d question true motivation don’t ALSO care protecting themselves. 

At end day don’t really care reasons though, get shot good book.  They're rushing ""buy"" bc shortage vaccines. bc picky. 

And paying vaccine may may come later. likely payments gone toward table deals already. even promised timeline ""most likely October March "". agree saying, exactly that? I’m teacher. screamed (literally) schools director repeatedly bringing concerns ventilation. board want hear teacher concerns made extremely clear. went back person months vaccine even approved teachers brought safety concerns including ventilation, social media full angry comments saying teachers lazy want zoom beach.

Neither Denmark Ireland excess stock waiting used.

Lots countries offered bought beginning regular EU purchase program. Denmark among countries start bought everything offered regular program. EU countries (but fairness, likely expected deliveries, especially AZ, would reliable ended being). also one countries consistently able get doses vial (one countries discovered forwarded data ECDC). That's Denmark, despite mostly using AZ J&amp;J, far able generally follow EU countries vaccination speed. nothing recent purchase outside regular purchase program, start effect within next couple weeks (and case equal less 5% population fully vaccinated, nearly enough results going far ahead others). originally expected deliveries month, actually looked like Denmark would start fall bit behind speed soon, resulting finished later. recent purchase, looks like country able continue without falling behind.

Regardless, relevant speed vaccination. absolutely nothing final vaccination percentage various countries going reach. guestimate final percentage based uptake age groups already offered many polls conducted. looking things, number northern European countries, incl. Ireland Denmark, quite consistently near top. Based polls, Portugal Spain also likely end high percentages. [last conducted European Union, percentages people ""very likely"" ""rather likely"" get vaccine Portugal 4th highest among 27 EU countries (page 17). Additionally, looking ourworldindata [graph first nice see Portugal still seems heading indication slowing (as seen US countries). virus going inflame heart, vaccine might thing. I'll get sick then. Heart inflammation seem like symptom care double on. think idea Rapid Antigen Test get false negative, given push testing countries picked subsequent rest. also mean micrograms. Yes Pfizer.  Ontario, Canada still allow indoor dining. Malls still closed, even nearly 50% adults second dose, 75% eligible adults vaccinated first dose.   Considering healthcare workers exposed huge amount Covid 19 viral load, 600 infection 600 thousand vaccinated pretty good least hindsight although need actual study Sinovac Delta.

What worries though Russia whose Sputnik vaccines type (Vector) Janssen/AZ. Unlike say UK always used mRNA vaccines, little availability there. would take step further. possible “flu season” kids going back school?


Our biggest surge US happened COVID would perfect time grow exponentially schools. 


If keep measures place, it’ll interesting see sickness general reduced California especially Flu season. 


Basically, kids wear masks protect rest us, worth it? It’s interesting question, imagine it’s studied before.

Appalachia genuinely like whole world. mind boggling. live Florida despite maybe driving areas go visit family much exposure Appalachia professor college showed us documentary social work policy class blew mind.   It’s mask. 


For people it’s like putting socks morning. Ya, like walking barefoot realize put shoes it’s way better socks not. 


Kids resilient. Unless actively trying annoyed mask, it’s big deal. studies claim Sinovac work? 
 
By studies mean peer-reviewed scientific papers published reputable medical journals? Well, one said choices consequences. Rule #1: fear-monger say fear-mongering. saw teachers nurses country refuse get vaccinated. 54% people recieved first dose (France). government debate whether make vaccination medical staff mandatory. US. No, absolutely way Netherlands could followed Australian approach Australian outcome. First all, Netherlands would survive without border workers coming every day essential jobs. Also international transport would ensure virus would brought point. Exactly whole brand politics build around never accepting responsibility anything. many many many mistakes outright unlawful behaviour. never take responsibility. think compare countries, uk legal mask restrictions always light (essentially, shops public transport only) large percentage people likely voluntarily continue venues legal mandate removed, especially surrounding advice continue wear crowded places consideration around you. Masks really politicised uk like us. C'mon. understand wise means? definition small minority population. 

Government responsibility define ENFORCE rules benefit big majority. Even majority would happy.

Taxes, traffic fines, police... Shall get rid enforcement areas wise people would take advantage?! countries already got lot immunity either vaccination infection. UK, remember first relaxed last ""If NSW would far worse per capita virus much infectious. Federal Government states would redirect vaccines put NSW. That's Melbourne University epidemiologist insisted ""real option"" plunge state even tougher, draconian lockdown next fortnight.  12 older present time.  reasoning that? lot news articles, talks good get booster 6 month - 1 year point.. antibodies wane.. I'm already 6 month mark since fully vaccinated.

edit: give fuck upvotes.. still understand people need that.. I'm trying ask learn entirely accurate. Clubs close full stop. open day either. Yup. perfect. basing opinion relative freedom Netherlands damage caused pandemic, think it’s fair say hasn’t worse countries. course. (But I’m afraid countries see UK Netherlands extreme outliers ignore fact Delta variant completely taken over) That's gatekeeper. Get vaccinated, exemption, stay out. work case many can't get vaccinated yet. reported multiple research ls studies. nobody paid attention, since focus hospitals Bold claim. happened “this last reply”? fine, still much allowed. think current wave going turn another lockdown, 100% guarantee obviously.

So far government closed bars clubs.

Your country may demand quarantine visiting Netherlands however
That could issue. wishing could keep something them. nice harassed people want spend money momentary, trifling experiences. say yes, often would like to, otherwise relationships suffer.

I mean, like go *occasionally*. occasionally. perfectly happy book, good show, video game, spending time writing code bank account actually grows. actually both.

Also - unfit advisors severe gaps scientific knowledge. Common sense - none found. Corruption abuse crisis sky-high profits - started surface. (or mis) educated. terrible risk assessment.

As much Republicans convinced they're microchipped, minorities convinced they're marked deportation. pretty absurd given details (really, Biden, Newsom, mark hundreds thousands deportation haphazard mass vaccination campaign millions, no, special).

Some people lazy experiencing side effects, insist would ruined ever side effects, careers kids. Bad assessment, COVID would worse side effect, cold flu something able tough out. fun, survived it, amd that's excuse wimp vaccine choose timing of. Get responsible. shot, spray mist, needle involved. needle involved here, mist spray. Wtf? Welp, makes Canada look good. Exactly. one looks carefully results clinical trials J&amp;J they'll see protection much stronger month longer shot two weeks out. understand CDC says consider fully vaccinated two weeks shot. vaccinated J&amp;J essentially cautious vaccination four five weeks afterwards. restrictions + low vaccinations = Higher percentage older/vulnerable catching everything open one cares.

That population probably careful last year. Wooooow literally wants happening UK right now. Huge spike cases delta variant… followed nothing. catastrophic hospitalization levels, wave deaths. People got sniffles days got better. 

Vaccines work. hell anti vaxxers; I’m totally unwilling make sacrifices protect them. Hospitals NL 200 corona patients whole country. Something like 20 intensive care. scary. really think that's entirely accurate. stand walk closet door closed terminally ill covid patients coughing lungs get covid 14 days second shot. Unless old immune deficient. Dutch, sorry. says rate currently 14.9%. remember less 4%

Edit: sn English version get mean. Verstappens fans fault Education race probably play role.  Oh, really.

From change system pay traffic fines. Government takes away cameras. People report break rules pay fine via web site.

Same taxes.

If work, blame people businesses.  Yes, Australia dictatorship. South Korea, New Zealand, etc too. See virus evolves far simply ability connect cells anymore, cause main thing virus changes spike protein. worked Canada done early effects Delta variant became widespread.

Right, fuck around play ""Vaccine shopper"" country. assholes Canada shopped vaccines large soon something available took it. personally took first dose AZ soon could get it, regardless clotting issue. got second dose Moderna last week.

No, pandemic showed us anything working conditions need improvement. Seriously. Schools across New England required yearly flu shots teachers ages states mandated kids last year too. sex club? I'm curious vector spreading was. could normal club. Lol. ridiculous many levels. cruises run fully vaccinated staff. everyone cruise fully vaccinated, freaking testing positive. going happen. need quarantine ship positive cases, running dumb ass cruise first place. There's still tons COVID cases US. mexico great! know, right election time green light! need another election, green again... probably high, 70% isnt going suffice anymore.

But heard immunity doesnt seem plausible anymore. virus going stay. Still enough people get sort immunity pandemic eventually fizzle out, become like annual flu. vaccine much effective mask. worn one since state said unvaccinated need them. misleading, clubs completely closed, bars fixed seat 1.5m away tables allowed, close midnight. that's it, huh? We're kinda Netherlands increase virus cases? bit still avoid crowds socialize two people time good distance us. mind partying..of follow every rule, dont Eh, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

The people dying right mostly suffering consequences actions. Well could say entire corona measures people every age group follow rules ( mostly looking elders follow rules supermarket). However, jump definitely fault age group everybody knows it. went party followed rules blame. people used fake test results went parties knowing corona..not good word them. Scientists saying virus never going away anymore.

But mean pandemic continues, enough people sort immunity. Even virus mutates unlikely deadly early 2020.

But unvaccinated yet sick, virus going anywhere.

Time tell that. relaxation measures, officially published delta cases doubling every week.

Government loves ignore facts go public opinion. Earth thinking running cruise crews fully vaccinated? entire ship vaccinated, point, live it. can't quarantine ship people test positive. would akin quarantining ship flu. changing messages difficult know, think necessary. 

In Singapore, pushed 3/4 week gaps Pfizer Moderna respectively 6-8 weeks Delta cases started rising could enough first dose coverage face limited supply. supply constraints removed, gap brought back 3/4 weeks. 

It's difficult communicate policy changes well, think making sure whatever vaccines available go towards maximizing much coverage possible. I'm sure timeline perhaps could changed policy sooner, change necessary.  concluded Covid start wet market. Isn’t herd immunity point vaccination program? 

You reach point enough people immune/protected, mostly vaccination, can’t vaccinated level protection well less likely catch it.

I’m sure language like “let rip” particularly helpful accurate stage. We’re 12 months ago.

Now, it’s getting case treating Covid like treat seasonal flu. Many people still die Covid get lives. don’t say “let seasonal flu rip” year often flu deaths thousands. I’d totally push everyone (except legit medically exempt) make life difficult refuse. Like can’t go school, work, dmv, gym, etc. patience people anymore. Bet they’re masks too. could’ve pandemic already.  wrong compare EU counties. Compare success failure.

Australia far one single death covid year. less lock downs Netherlands. 

Yes, yes, heard argument - Australia island. irrelevant. Netherlands means money lock country Australia did. Red Team ignored, time government, even omt, looking publick opinion rather science experience many, many countries. need stop mass testing focus hard cases/hospitalisations. 

This leading us nowhere. agree every measure put place. reason new measures installed otherwise country go red people cant go vacation everybody crying again. However, good word young people ruin everybody else getting tested using fake test results enter party. minister health incompetent idiot. can't understand he's still charge. Literally everything touched last 1,5 year, massive failure. governments take seriously. Indoor dining bars gyms A-OK hospitals overloaded city.

But lots people take seriously avoided stuff year. one scariest ways administer vaccine shot numbers? No. government stated 10% total infection numbers TvT Dumb fucking headline. 95% figure always referred 95% _reduction_ compared risk unvaccinated person. personal exposure level high enough still leave decent chance catching it. chance substantially higher delta unfortunately risk reduction great. 

The idea individual person 5% chance ever catching covid lives vaccinated misunderstanding don’t see public health organisations correcting often enough. This. went colleagues decided hire office internship. We've also drinking night, reason celebrate Source? Everything read suggests single dose Pfizer effective delta variant. 24.. still alive without parties breaking rules. socialize still follow rules. Also, important reason happening people got covid literally go party anyway people get tested fake test results. way find normal. parents vaccinated chances end hospital low. people 40s ot soon 2nd shot. Keep mind early statistics showing suicides, mass shootings auto deaths MUCH LOWER previous years odd there's many excess Username doesn’t check out. think change Callous-Web-911. denmark is. use mine gym eating out. I’m asked click icon reveals name, scan passport. mean nastier ? haven’t thought wouldn’t mind looking vaccines think shots child tho haven’t doctor since 13 don’t know start go Unless hospitalization rates start rising think fine.

Uk cases rising weeks ago, my.understanding increase cases mostly vaccinated population impact.

I'd like see masks public, much reminder everyone keep distance, buy think much announced Friday. I'm sure, never required 5's tested presume would stay could travel fully vaccinated toddler. Yeah use same. Faking it, it’s forgerr, faked passport, drivers license etc. 

They added live clock changing colours ours, still picture wont work Well, absolutely fuck that.

I think I'll take arm shot twice needle fucking nose. Ok everyone turn favorite animal get nasal vaccine lol. corona dashboard government Dutch though. see, large majority increase infections people &lt;30. people fully vaccinated yet, (if got Janssen) immune yet got vaccinated recently.

Hospital admissions still low, increased bit today. Sunday, numbers delayed though, we’ll see happens coming week. US 15K 20K daily cases, Netherlands reporting US equivalent 170,000 180,000 cases day, going there?? Yes, thanks polio vaccine. negative excess death rate, mean less people died usually otherwise would I’m bit glad don’t waste vaccine money partially vaccinated holdouts, realize pharmacies would let shots expire still bill someone, ultimately screwing medical prices.  Ehh. dunno. People really stupid stuff don’t understand- especially misinformation age everybody computer pocket world’s knowledge thinks know best interpret data.

Look numbers people didn’t wear seatbelt back day, despite car. Science extremely clear cut save lives EVEN DAY there’s folks say kill people save. took laws mandating enormous social awareness campaign make dent all.

Look corporations refuse pay minimum wage - least amount legally pay people - despite again, evidence clear cut afford pay work harder happier. It’s really debate evidence is, again, overwhelmingly obvious.

Or restaurant food safety standards OSHA safety standards etc. Even relatively strict enforcement clear punishments ignoring rules, still happens lot… would far rampant wasn’t enforcement.

So also want people what’s right them… Unless doctor warns hesitate get shot based personal health conditions, really isn’t valid reason get vaccinated. started free speech backer, seemed like right idea, realize people crying free speech rights either use ethnic slurs social media recrimination -or- presenting outright lies misinformation unchecked, start realize slippery slope free speech absolutism offers really sewage ditch filled offal. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

They already paying vaccine!

That's frustrating Sounds like stress accumulating going kill covid does. Calm live life like rest us. Go outside vaccinated people still spread covid? actually thinking nice see government honest trade-offs changing circumstances. message really confusing: 12-week interval best long-term immunity, immediate immunity important area rising cases. nobody allowed onsite unless they've fully vaccinated.

I want boss this, think he's afraid piss anyone surveying who's vaccinated hasn't, starting grace period. process even started. Yeah sucks. lot people's summers ripped away early looser measurements 
The real issue view impacts vaccination rates. Teens/young adults already vaccinated high enough rates. teenager, able remove masks school would huge incentive get vaccinated. state removing powerful tool raise vaccination rates, opinion. 

Of course, doesn’t apply 12. Hopefully Pfizer shot gets approved younger kids soon. disappointed. Found moms good friend believes 5G, fortunately mom dad already vaxxed seriously WTF. Also mom said trying talk someone else getting shot spreading misinformation SMH That's equal 170,000 US cases I'm calling bullshit. mix Pfizer Moderna shots first second doses. get vaccine bith.

Edit: Looked up. Apparently that's thing now. No, different vaccines regards mixing.

Getting anything currently used major governments first shot one dose Pfizer Moderna second seems great combination. estimates show around million  don’t know got 1/3 figure, you’re also implying long Covid symptoms last forever, obviously isn’t known Florida governor explicitly prevented schools requiring masks.

What improved ventilation mean? there's what? doubt sincerity Florida's schools. turn housing.

Full immunity far vaccine goes. aware vaccine, like vaccines confer 100% immunity Lol, PTA? obviously never worked education. It’s governments fault. Everyone America knows vaccines free widely available; onus people point. promoting completely false idea country choosing lockdowns vaccines. one country shunning vaccines acting like lockdowns permanent solution. 

But countries access vaccines right many months Australia NZ anywhere close herd immunity. **In absence vaccines**, lockdown solution proven multiple studies best solution economy, public health mental health allows people live totally normal, mask-free lives without social distancing 99% time.

I’m absolutely sickened people aren’t getting vaccinated done Covid icu year . Like simple answer get vaccinated longer excuse hard get , hell paying get vaccine . I've feeling fine right 3-4 days first dose though :/ important fact ignored. Alabama also important note Seychelles used 43/57 rollout AstraZeneca &amp; Sinopharm yet media always put Sinopharm title insinuated majority vaccine.

In reality, 80% severe cases among unvaccinated iirc total 6 fatalities among fully vaccinated - 5 dead AZ 1 Sinopharm. imagine way around, would seeing every media outlet headlines like ""6 fully vaccinated dead Seychelles, 5 used CHINESE vaccine"". since AZ, flew radars. COVID vaccine tv commercials country?

No. Basically everybody wants vaccinated anyway, matter waiting patiently age group opened booking. 

People wasting money time making tv ads convince people vaccinated sign vaccination resistance close many vaccinated people get. even close that.  Low levels zero. mention bunch different animals also gotten Covid. able eradicate Covid, control keep low.  think space shots would react vaccine. 8 weeks body wouldn’t overwhelmed.

If feel fine, would get second dose 6 weeks. I’ve family member get 5 weeks feeling fine! No, that's true. Spanish Flu also airplane automobiles help spread around faster either. however; somewhat twat. Yes, countries companies based get first dibs. Versus Arizona governor decreed school university require masks. others reading this, think obviously proves commenter nothing troll good one that. frustrating thing know lot people higher things vaccinated. Like, former president Trump one first people get vaccinated. But, see vehicle culture wars, keep lying gullible audience. mention strain puts hospitals non-covid related emergencies. think would made much difference all. People used politics justify actions, politics would made choices justified differently.

In words, conservative refusing vaccine politics taken anyway, real reason, deep down, want to, would case even never given right vote. Lol. cannot believe people fall shit!  freetus plan get mRNA. I'll consider there's data especially CDC starts recommending it. I've def heard people already going ahead getting mRNA top J&amp;J. It’s also likely getting delta Variant post vaccine may act booster anyway albeit mild symptoms. Govment fucked  Yep, point become Israel world?

I'm glad masks mandatory law country  That's entitlement I'm one asking that. Masks worn properly roughly 80% effective matter variant physical barrier. Immune response irrelevant.

With vaccine it’s pretty close foolproof. guess many there's fear deported racially profiled (minorities tend distrust government). also Hispanic conservatives, likely going hold similar views white conservatives.  So, really booster time already? 6ish months? know specifically talking at-risk people, thought booster would maybe annual. respect it. cost peace. Yeah think idiotic can't burden like that. accept that's mentality care enougg take weight trying change them. One many ways practice DETACHMENT. heard last year sure guess. skipping mask mandate 2 weeks prior true? Almost  think mean ""losing"". none winning right now. People aware that. care. ever people around them. closed FB account 3 years ago. Best move eva!  read article saying Pfizer lasts 10 years Unless improvements vaccine manufacturing capacity, yes Mathematically eliminate serve protect, you’re left “my country good” permitted murder That's terrific question. annual flu shot merely guess strain flu would expect see following year based data previous versions. efficacy extremely low comparison Covid vaccine. anywhere 30%-50%. 

Since influenza virus, always changes. essentially yearly booster. course year, antibodies drop memory cells offer immunity you. 

It's adaptive immunity important getting yearly flu shot. antibodies drop off, body ""memory"" encounters antigen again. downvotes get constantly, occurred one cares shitty racist opinions? dumbass  trying reopen much possible, that's retail workers obligated wear masks states, most? tourist I'm rude enough argue tour guide. Unfortunately people rude. psychology perspective, perhaps try something like ""my boss threatened fire wear masks car , would really appreciate help. take masks outside""

Sometimes try appeal jerks unfortunately Unless vaccinated people start filling hospitals, don’t think idea wearing masks change. 

Even so, pandemic ending end eventually, that’s works. Spanish Flu ended without vaccines, would covid different especially since vaccines? People evaluate risks determine they’d like wear mask not. 

This virus circulating year vaccines remained effective variants. would variant evade vaccine especially since transmission rate lot lower January lot people vaccinated even it’s half country. context, means virus done enough destruction warrant booster. means let's proactive it, let's wait deaths. That's tells me. reactive attitude towards advising people wear masks started. work self centered a*hole antimask antivaxxers thing don’t even allow high school students staff, virtually opportunity vaccinate, wear mask fall, absolutely trust ever allow maskless faces again. They’ll always say “it’s big deal, it’s safe”. made perfect sense 2020, ever move forward? get culturally aspects society always different pre pandemic, I’d like people forming habits rather hard rules. Yeah, really affirmed everything expected / society breaks down.

Are science here, nah?  What’s projection delta? Realistically would shocked schools closed again, what’s plan ""No politics"" amiright? directly pay vaccine. Got it.  Also betting big shot antivaxers like Christaine Northrup vaccinated. They're con people. wealth, others political power. Exactly. It’s selfishness gullibility willing spread others. first shot 3 weeks ago, second three weeks. even want vaccinated, takes Hard really get properly fitted one, try wear can. Unfortunately still need something protect eyes  “It death rate .01%” that’s we’re still shit point view. 
They think protecting conspiracy (take pick popular ones there) human race. 
It pretty scary imagine deluded many people weak critical thinking skills are. 
There Illuminati looking eliminate human race… one, would lean remain power? really trying angle? Replace vaccine mask know well went certain demographic. don’t care. found funny China said bats much jumped animal person meat market... place noticeably sell bats rarely sold pangolins.

Maybe bats, that's pretty much confirmed.. where's infected bat? bats market? wait 3 weeks tell human human infection? kidnapping putting trunk? would want protect people around me? ‘Murcia!!! Talk cheap! :( would protect unvaccinated people??? Coworker anti-vaxx several young children. get covid, guess poor kids suffering it? Big surprise. do.

The point is, catch people catch it.

That's vax for. also helps protect person wearing mask. get sick seeing people pretend doesn't. Western countries like think indoctrination propaganda.

I’d love see general populace start push socialist leaning policy re-thinking unions mean workers. Yeah,our son go person next year, masks mandatory still here. He's good on. think he's saying *technically* suggested sub lot posts based Fauci said, one ignore Fauci's advice. course, heavily implied.

Have great day too! People devoutly parry with, ""My body, choice!"" vaccination virus killed 4M people world wide failing invoke intended irony (to co-opt argument allow choice safe legal abortion), fail miss essential point altogether.

So yeah covid big problem. rapid global warming is. bad case, messaging needed crowd, say makes impact guess. Thats exactly sub wants tho. give government power. can't count many comments I've seen people saying government needs force vaccines passports restrictions Listening CDC guidance = caring pandemic. That's take. I’m vaccinated friend live Missouri one vaccine clinics already shut due dwindling interest. calling everyone advise they’d find second location get second shots. disagree, 65% completely immunized high time ease restrictions. 

By next week reached 70 anyway. bona fide incubator. reasons multiple: protect self, protect family, get back normal, interact vaccinated individuals, part help end this, probably others thinking of. 
I’d lying didn’t say self preservation health reason number one though. share us non-Dutch thought process people indifferent wearing masks? one place would expected mask wearing done, would health-care facilities. Seems like major abrogation responsibility one's health set appropriate example one's profession responsibility society customers one serves. think there's probably growing acknowledgment new variants introduced next several years impossible vaccinate vast majority populations places like Brazil India. Even supply issue, sheer logistics rollout scale unfathomable. Add political dimension developing countries leaders downplay pandemic's effects.  great example internet works.

Completely misunderstand simple statement, rant *other* person stupid.

I seriously hope age 16. Found graph this, add “That’s get variants eventually we’ll need new vaccines maybe lot dead people.” certainly clearly see lack urgency southern Illinois, like rest Illinois all. conclude one reads here. read contains useful information. Add media reports needing boosters new modified vaccines works  accept someone making idiotic choice without respecting it. Sorry don’t know vaccines work they’d different, see higher efficacy preventing symptomatic infection Sinopharm. Ok, perhaps different social microcosm. 
That interpretation peoples’ true motivation incorrect. 
As said though, don’t give two shits person’s reasons getting shot - I’m glad see every one administered.  saying beginning, may bad reaction COVID people could potentially transmit could. historic reasons minority distrust American institutions. isn’t recent phenomenon. don’t hear mainstream Democrat telling minorities get vaccination. anti-vaccine practically part GOP platform point. Apples oranges. People accepting reality. vaccines don’t prevent viruses 100%. I’m sick enough right could died elderly compromised immune system. don’t think anyone good answers right now. People don’t want hear it. Southern Illinois far away Chicago distance world view get. Reading fundamental. “Adverse effects” != contraction. 30-200k treat bad case covid hospitals. 

5-60 bucks per dose vaccine. prevent cost 


What's money maker? Death rate basically zero, even vaccinated healthy. masses also take vaccine Netherlands, there's supply issue pretty much Europe. youngest generation fully vaccinated born 1960s. rest simply offered two doses yet.

The case simply one opening soon. I'm curious earth could different conclusion. Genuinely.

It's getting vaccine, possibly boosters, MUCH better chance fighting virus **versus** relying immune system withstand COVID variants. 

Sure, average person getting COVID well time, however, risk *each* variant, way, likely, progressively get worse?

I can't see argument. vaccine gave shit side effects bit COVID gave shit side effects bit, hell would risk getting virus vaccine?

I mean preach. I've seen overwhelming amount comments suggesting vaccine vital. think there's ounce solid argument suggest risking virus better jab. Versus Vermont, Department Education said schools require students staff wear masks. still can’t believe people actually believe 5G. Like, practically negative outcome vaccine would believable. Say gives AIDS something. somehow makes people *radio transmitters* things. Ah, mean riots looters took advantage protests, actually part protests? looters? that’s happened city. Yeah. educational/access/whatever issues aside, school kids staying home exposure-based two week quarantines somewhat manageable fair number people, generally expected physically work slight bit difficult. got vaxxed. want restrictions lifted. care people want get vaxxed can't. wrong? nervous wishing normality nothing believing wishing well. referring downvoted simply stating situation. basically expect uptick asymptomatic/mild cases (and extension, suppose infectivity), much hospitalizations death? explain, since shortage short-sightedness here.

I see we're resorting low quality insults instill authority. Good strategy. leadership tells us boosters necessary now, necessary?

When research complete shows definitively timeframe vaccine's protection fades level justifies booster original vaccine... stated repeatedly publicly people claiming trying kill us basic, proven science. opinions necessary answer question. variant completely evades vaccine unprotected?

A booster current vaccines would necessarily help variant combated current vaccines. booster necessarily relevant unless tweaked booster - one would tweaked combat variant currently exist since we're theorizing comment thread, can't really new vaccine block yet. case ""when necessary"" would become ""when exists"", reaction irresponsibility part Fauci CDC reactionary. 

It's intriguing take i'm kinda baffled by, i'm sure goal i'm going guess it. political violate rule 4, since randomly brought violating subreddit rules next part. suspicious conspiracy theory? No, opinion source material, expressing one violate rules subreddit, it. Understand now?

It's opinion justifying complete omission publicly stated facts insertion conspiracy theory (call opinions tickles fancy) governing bodies intentionally mishandling virus response. know think i'm claiming can't post opinions breaking rules. countries don’t this?

Obviously, already got checked out, told nothing. trying assure arrhythmia fatal side effect vaccine extremely unlikely anything serious. never said see doctor, explained mechanism might feeling versus prior vaccine what's problem?

Vulnerable people vaccinated (those want it).

You 500K cases day, corpses street, problem, cases mean absolutely nothing. going daily press conferences amount flu cases well or...?

This virus us forever, think dangerous you, trust vaccin, get vaccin, bother OTHERS get vaccin, vaccines ALWAYS yourself, whoever tells need vaccinate others telling lies, credible expert confirm that. affects care? can’t force people anything, matter much benefits you. people’s lives don’t revolve around yours. say someone who’s fully vaccinated since March.   good example media governments made bad choice repeatedly suggesting public listen clinicians, rather stressing accurate information comes researchers. MDs RNs espouse every fool idea sun, lack relevant education, critical analysis skills, accountability researchers. Surely. biggest thought want live without husband daughter, high risk. certainly would gotten vaccine anyway, like dead. :) time flu almost killed made fond vaccines. study found bats something akin social distancing ill. data headline within article, idea “no evidence” linking SARS-CoV-2 bats provably false. Maybe say it, thats believe, they'd get vaccine. Or, care. Look, numbers clearly bad. vulnerable population fully vaccinated high rates. relationship cases deaths nearly strong anymore, shown figures bad without seeing peak deaths. Yes, recent data Canada shows AZ would reduced hospitalisations 83% SA variant (beta) single dose! ..and figure wss 88% delta! Agreed. I've people work say face told I'm trying protect high risk husband. longer speak people seem get why. ask would tell them. There’s difference masked, outdoors, protesting systemic racism, BBQ friends/family likely unmasked, close together, probably gonna hug go inside someone’s house use restroom point. You’re also far likely drop guard around people you’re comfortable with, rather strangers.

 don’t know anyone caught COVID protest, know tons people caught family gathering spread everyone there. J&amp;J already approved No, it’s it’s public safety. don’t want get vaccine it’s choice it’s also choice impact safety everyone else’s leave house. Problem becomes it’s choice, choice impacts EVERY PERSON COME CONTACT WITH. it’s also reason joined optional phase pandemic virus continue mutate continues spread pockets UNVACCINATED people. It’s cruel version Darwinism completely avoidable. Fucking joey. called recombination.
As far know viruses happen. two variants strains virus infect cell time. Right. Low vaccinations, mask mandate health measures.  Yes, completely agree you. southern ILLINOIS 25 minutes STL. apathy haze rolling people like thick fog. everyone likes working home. friends work form home sick shit it. Someone even changed jobs site. literally hear great people Twitter little boy now? better? people like him, family not, got vaccinated still mask for. imagine through.  protest irrelevant, whether soccer match protest irrelevant, thousands people gathering enclosed space extended period time inherently risky. I’m trying make political statement clear. 

You can’t support strict lockdowns restrictions encourage people gather crowds thousands people  still alive!! Arrr...how even possible ??? would expect case countries universal healthcare? Let explain, since shortage short-sightedness here. leadership tells us boosters necessary now, necessary? variant completely evades vaccine unprotected? reaction irresponsibility part Fauci CDC reactionary. conspiracy theory? No, opinion source material, expressing one violate rules subreddit, it. Understand now? Yup, Netherlands basically Florida. Hype working assumption system would allow us educate people. People call snob eat potlucks. I'm snob liking crotch pet hair casserole it. Fully vaccinated vaccine may ask? Janssen pfizer? Fauci's pov, help much, since job keep everyone dying covid,  Netherlands? super significant factor given got kicked tourney covid explosion. Many people still follow Euros, watch parties countries Netherlands common.  Jesus also went way wash hands, know, maybe best book take health advice from. combo flu/covid shot works. surge region indeed higher point pandemic far state high. looking total hospitalizations, people needing ICU last wave, even balancing factors. Additionally, regular hospital admissions without Covid back pre-pandemic numbers people aren’t modifying behavior anymore. majority people admitted unvaccinated, around 95% stat hospital CEOs giving. They’ve admitted last 2 weeks longer precise data overwhelming admissions people sick aren’t able confirm vaccination status. surge starting spread across Missouri possibility intensely bad low vaccination rates. ""America greatest country world"" propaganda embedded lot people's brains, esp older crowd. Look lengths go make people feel like America best, Pledge Allegiance said school, leaving crucial parts Anthem make patriotic playing sporting events everyone standing up, overzealous fawning military, display flag, whole host propaganda tricks keep people line. Gives work, get paid do. Travel nurses making bank this. right way. kids can't get vaccinated next best thing mask. rocket science.  Everyone weigh two options may come different conclusion point, it’s job. also put tons extra work Americans won’t stop shoveling food mouths, that’s also entirely preventable. feel like majority unvaccinated hopeless point come around anything think masks help make safer anyone unable wear one varied health issues. way one misses safe possible. 

One biggest problems society seems everyone views issues two sides many options middle. really hope whatever finally done lets twins (and like them) get socializing need deserve! whole thing fucking weird people giving shit others ignorant science. hostile aliens attacked Earth, 40% population would say hoax great think life lost career, home, separated partner, getting timely treatment cancer been?

How great things going developing world people starvation?

There balance. dying things people like care. hospital CEOs area cited people coming hospital sicker, onset appears quicker average age younger last wave. husband 30-something (rather large) team pass past week it. Leaves behind 3 younger kids.  Wow. brand new information /s Yes, lot people see everything black white partisan lense grey area paint everyone hasn’t vaccinated anti vaxx, reality haven’t gotten jab apathetic. apathetic isn’t right, it’s same. people living dictatorships OK subjugated. makes hard fight. Box fan plus furnace filter…

Simple effective. ages dropped significantly according hospital reports past 6 weeks. they’re busy give detailed reports. 3 deaths affected general acquaintances SW MO past month, three elementary school aged children. hospital put information people showing sicker going presumed contact hospital like 5 days versus 10.   yup. Let happen though. dummies wanna dummy can't help em. period moderate turbulence, agency says, passenger got seat use lavatory, arguing drinking five hours prior flight convincing flight attendants really needed go.

RIP bars airports people like ruin everyone. Trust ~~science~~ federal government. would say that's antivax. shame took one dudes get knocked butt learn it. Here's hoping long term horrible. Yeah think right Lol everyone took booster, late True. Bouncer check thorough fieldlab events, new vaccinations given green light untill two weeks, even. Well, good part risk group. I'd believe choose get pushed every media, corporation government get even virus 0,05% morality rate age group.

How authorities lying conspiracy theory? still spread virus vaccinated, letting people stop using masks obligation getting vaccinated reward convince getting it, based scientific fact. June Orgy month Netherlands, orgy cases showing now. wore mask required job really feel like trying luck event stores wanted call cops wearing it. state live, refusing wear mask store gave store right charge trespassing. think misread post. fully vaccinated, long time. Right... literally said “it isn’t clear” “suggests may” true champion.  Tbh read much that. news read/hear passing imgur. wonder vaccine developing children. pregnant women. met 3 said going risk it.

I know industry says safe, considering vaccine around decade makes wonder well know risks side effects. probably extrapolate stuff without actual time passing deep grounded research... dono.. take time. 30 thousand cases day increasing, certainly feel control me.

I wish got control people double jabbed removing restrictions.......also get get rid mask rules shops/supermarkets public transport. Fair enough, go pub, nightclub sports event know risks avoid feel comfortable.

Something can't easily comes going shops, supermarkets using public transport.... symptoms meant stadiums, think controlled enough, like Eurovision, problem. Eh, fault. sub lot people kept pushing idea breakthrough cases rare. think actually way common people realize. truly tested vaccine ""normal,"" non masked circumstances, non socially distanced spaces long term. think vaccines effective they'll lower hospitalizations lot think get COVID point honestly. IIRC, tetanus shots every 10 years studies study that. There's even research indicating may strong levels antibodies 30 years last vaccination. still get tetanus shot per vaccination schedule, timetable certainly definite thing. 

Flu another interesting case due large variety strains quickly mutates. might comparable COVID per se, think would absurd COVID shot like there's flu shot. That’s adults get vaccinated. husband double vaccinated 40. risk us exceptionally low, definitely high enough vaccinate children put risk. mutation percentage gains immunity due previous infection, vaccines etc. Even pior infection give 100% immunity gives enough let's say 75% people. years run people seriously affected.

In pandemics past lot people died get point. Fortunately bad one case. thought Kenneth Copeland blew wind God eradicate ting. health issues know about? really don’t want prophet doom, saw post immediately thought “… !-(  “ Denmark donates AZ J&amp;J since they've withdrawn program. probably lot countries mRNA vaccines going waste doubt they'd prefer donate rather sell northern Europe. Thanks, exactly thing, on-topic answer useful information! People losing shit this, dont care need booster flu vaccine every 12 months. 2 months since fully recovered. I'll wait another month get vaccine. thank much assistance. people even know Biontech/Pfizer MRNA vaccine great Delta all?

At preventing serious illness death is. regards cases, quite similar vaccines. government pulls nonsense every time. 

""Woooh neeeever could anticipated go craaazyy woooow.""

Literally every outside observer, us internal observers did. didn't. Shocker. act like fuck up, poor risk calculation fault. 

Ugh.  Right, think context COVID, we've somehow decoupled ""protecting vulnerable"" ""stopping spread"" two highly interrelated. COVID spread, dangerous become less efficacious vaccines proven be. They're still highly efficacious, get wrong, zero advantage allowing continue things been. could easily end scenario COVID contagious measles (R12-18), far better overcoming infection induced immunity (Delta already path 12 months initial infection), would mean would need close 100% people vaccinated meaningful control things. get stuck 50% unvaccinated continuous uncontrolled spread, yearly waves far excess flu well rapid degradation vaccine efficacy. theory, sure, theory also get doorknob someone touched hours ago, know odds probably order 1 10,000. Epidemiology what's theoretically possible, that's small piece it. odds matter. example, ""in theory"" could get food, surveys epidemiological studies showed practically speaking, no, get food.

Now there's difference surface transmission case (such doorknob mall) food case: former, *do* known cases; surface transmission *is* really thing. established unlikely much rarer air transmission. Food, hand, known confirmed cases people searching long time, suggests thing all, though still theoretically possible.

As past winter, far know, casual outdoor transmission category: possible theory, single confirmed case known happen, indicates vanishingly rare less worth worrying than, say, whether car road swerve onto sidewalk kill (also quite possible!).

What I'm asking is, anyone know whether cases actually confirmed yet? searched time time found any, may missed it. cracks up. Karens Kens flocking stuff completely missing point? got vaccinated. choose get shot, end day government's enacting rules based vaccination population.

I really want talk theories conspiracies. people love sound French Italian. whatever reason fell love Russian spent years studying it, lived bit well, listen Russian podcasts read news Russian regularly. much wider difference opinion would think. People hate politicians everywhere broadly Russia well. feeling got Russians cynical apathetic think anything could change better. brighter educated ones knew part eventually got out. replied yet? Oh absolutely never stopped. reason they’re talking booster ongoing clinical trials run alongside vaccination effort. 

They continue track efficacy vaccine. They’re talking third shot *because* they’re seeing either antibodies leaving circulation vaccinated people getting virus ending hospital. We’re around 1.2% COVID hospitalized vaccine. 

Whatever cause it’s trials directly driving decisions made. Pfizer companies industry really can’t make claim without evidence back up, precisely many people question don’t bring receipts.

Thankfully still appears current vaccines effective variants floating around. Pfizer really looking get ahead next variant *could* bypass vaccine require third shot. According article itself, 177 million total Pfizer doses given study, 283 inflammation cases reported. 0,0001% vaccinations. 
 
Yes, numbers. no, probably correct incidence rate. numbers like these, almost always least somewhat reported. likely 283 cases, rate higher calculated. Also, important understand cohort. seen data set, said higher incidence males 40. something cohort susceptible, means understand belong cohort order understand risk. 
 
Still, conclusion might exact - low risk, inhibit anyone getting vaccine. But, need precise accurate numbers calculations. Ah right forgot thing oops. Thanks volunteering trials way! it’s entirely call ones running clinical trials alongside emergency approval. aren’t saying people need NOW. That’s Pfizer saying. 

They saying current vaccine effective third shot necessary variants continue mutate are. vaccine CURRENTLY effective forms COVID. simply admitting won’t last variants continue.

Should come publicly have? Probably not. least without heads findings CDC/FDA make joint statement.

However, Pfizer right company say whatever want product. could easily stop providing vaccine third dose approved. 

The absolutely last thing Pfizer wants blamed COVID death vaccine didn’t work. That’s what’s driving actions here.

Keep mind people die side effects emergency approval largely protects them. it’s really win win Pfizer matter happens, long don’t die COVID claim (a reasonably healthy random sample population) protected vaccine.

My main point people hear “third shot” immediately jump “need now” Pfizer merely preparing public future third shot.

Again current variant vaccine effective. Pfizer merely getting ahead variants may come render third shot entirely new vaccine necessary. one necessary right now. thought going change bit last election surprised you. Mostly people know think. someone starts listing everything do. 

Zondag met Lubach something long back really opened eyes. Google searches can't really deny facts anymore. Combined way handled whole Corona thing...  thought going say 1.5 rule height restriction. Yeah forgot vaccinate...and 50 cases yesterday. see headline get perspective. Yeah think fully vaccined gp‘s shouldn‘t much problem incase much Delta. First mRNA dose drops 80% 30%. I'm willing entertain could one possible side it. that's case needs different model. 

That said hear lot antivax rhetoric news local ones. even gym 20 minutes snarky sign outside need mask gym, well vaccines available. went theme park. You’re talking wasn’t essential travel ! /s Enough what?

It enough herd immunity, no, still enough ro go back normal - especially uptake higher among vulnerable.

If enough bring hospitalizations deaths flu levels would say enough go back normal least. all, always tolerated thousands yearly deaths flu. never go concert again. hockey game, basketball game, wedding, big family thanksgiving, church, eat indoors. Simple. 4 states vacinated 50% Hispanics. state MD news 4th....last week. Doctors wore masks coronavirus. reasons wear one. hospitalisations/deaths would meaningful stat, cases mean shit unless ae going rate percentage staff get vaccine? disclosure personal choice one would know sure? Ridiculous spread vaccinated. vaccine protects others.

You complied rules set authorities based lies.  type headline harm good. risk miniscule condition temporary treatable. Leave Sky News muddle waters.  wish people understood concept. think nothing kind thing. meetings work relatively small rooms. I've explained longer sit even masked (half even mask) higher chances become catching someone shedding. say stuff like ""Hey masked."" roll eyes. think masks super shield stops covid 100%. understand raising lowing risk. That's it. Soo frustrating cocky attitude extending surmising making conjecture also making conjecture quoting specifics paper. discussion, scientific rebuttal. refuting author said, refuting random redditor said paraphrased article paraphrased argument laid statement virus continuing become optimal pandemic continues. expect virus already artificially optimized.

This said, paraphrasing information read. back up. loser grab weak copout. quoting you. author. Yeah X-ray vision awesome brah. 10/10 would get chipped again. WTF? load racist nonsense. Reported. What? said vaccinated people worried non vaccinated people do. vaccine prevents getting really sick suffering hard symptoms.

If get transmit it, vaccinated, vaccine meant protect you. care getting vaccine not, spread either way?

The vaccine affects vaccinated one. point was, vaccinated safe everyone risk, leave us alone, obligation get vaccine. vaccine affects one single person. Ugh, Chuang Yen Temple closed visitors since 2020.

WHY?! easy visit large temple complex taking enough precautions avoid catching disease. absolutely excuse kind action house worship anymore. crossing line understandable precaution outright disrespect.

Even now, they're still closed public despite New York reaching 70% vaccination rate dropping restrictions. important temple behaving like says lot true character. Got 2nd Moderna dose yesterday. First dose felt absolutely fine except slightly sore arm, think needed day work today. Showed zombified drained energy went home 30 minutes later. Still happy vaccine family friends got without anyone know getting seriously ill (or worse) virus. know there's lot people can't say same. fair comment.

I believe vaccine approved 16 vulnerable. can't offered children approved them. knows ever be. tried Netherlands.

Not great success  Natural immunity works well sorts contagious diseases, Black Death, Ebola ... they’re also posting “omg Plan B birth control bad you!!! 😳😳😳” uh… wouldn’t listen person’s opinion. I've Netherlands many times last 18 months saw people wearing masks. Probably people wore masks either tourists shoppers Germany. mean fair people government awful role models best severely corrupt worst. lot issues second Pfizer vaccine, first. Going already lot health issues (I already take beta blocker fast heart).

I unusual sleep. extremely agitated second shot. irritable sleep one night. 101.3 fever. envy people say slept after. sort crawling skin.

I'm sure point tachycardia hit (worse usual). usually take 2.5 mg bisoprolol slow heart (which usually fast standing), point 120 lying \*on\* 7.5 mg bisoprolol (and maximum dose 10 mg). leave bed two days all. started get right pulse got even higher. used water bottles urinate someone brought me. doctor tired medical problems, I'm tired tired them. wrote them, dismissed (as response). former cardiologist referred back PCP years ago said heart structurally sound could nothing sinus tachycardia PCP couldn't, continue bisoprolol. could gone ER suppose, there's long explanation I'd give didn't.

I got better back normal functioning maybe week half. started palpitation I've never see heartbeat abdomen. I'm reluctant go doctor dismissive experiences healthcare. pulse elevated increase bisoprolol again. also chest pains vaccine assumed OK changed position, told means muscular-skeletal, since learned that's case always. hope there’s option lower/smaller dose booster shot. need protection get, aftermath shots one two going many weeks now. I’d like top-up helps protection without keeping aching housebound again. need apologise, gave proper chuckle 🤣 Fellow JJ here. I've following multiple vaccine studies UK, Germany, etc. Even without Delta news, planning getting 3 eventually. I'm trying wait green light data says multiple vaccines good. Everything world mutates. matter time. Flu fast enough deal every year. Others, maybe every decade, maybe more? Covid? know personally. preliminary observations seem indicate eventually we'll dealing another covidXX. eventually new vaccines. need prepared multiple vaccines. There's lots vaccines targets - I've probably taken dozen throughout life normal USA life travel abroad. cross checked other. need data look right now, since everything fresh brand new, assure ourselves.   Pretty sure whole body unvaccinated /s came Thailand saying Sinovac isn’t effective Delta.

That said many thimes. cant find study. Hungary games 60k people, spread even weeks. vaccinated tho, also adult population vaccinated. could difference. can't lift rules enough vaccinated people, least guess. Yeah, positivity allowed sub! /s Cases perpetually “surging”. 

People interested solving problem somewhat interested language. Went house too. People watching football home together contributed bit, definitely majority spike Dammit people idea vaccine works. vaccinated, vaccine protects you, around you. still spread virus suffer effects disease full extent body fight it.

The vaccine risk getting sick disease.

Your vaccine affect anyone else you.

You make someone else sick covid matter vaccinated. truly trusted vaccine care non risk population did. point Pfizer’s statement context made problematic. 

The first problem subtext, Americans who’ve vaccinated 6+ months probably need booster soon. Pfizer’s call make, though strongly implied case. That’s government’s call, made using variety data points, Pfizer’s data. Pfizer needs prove trials particular boosters safe effective if/when need booster, job arbiter deciding (if ever) Americans need get extra doses — that’s public health decision, made public health agencies. 

The second problem Pfizer muddied waters time many Americans lack trust clarity vaccines. government long saying don’t need boosters time soon. Pfizer puts statement suggesting otherwise. confuses hell people environment millions Americans already hesitant.

Pfizer coordinating statements government beginning. doubt accident not. literary technique called metaphor. Sometimes, illustrating something similar different angle give people fresh perspective something, help break stale ways thinking.

Look up! Wait, 180k tests planned weekend 10% positive say? + growth explained Thank god Florida, always what’s everyone’s best interest sake Internet. (In case, control group future historians) Correction: little half Florida may remain unvaccinated. hope much longer. I'd like gone 2022.  Moderna, 2nd dose late March. many cases serious?

3,378?

Note 3,380 one day. real totals past 3 days far higher. Especially anything politically charged (which vaccines unfortunately are). Perfect guess taken time read understand literature commenting. Oh no, poor hospitals charge us anything paying price. Cry fucking river. No. people mild cases lingering “so…” then? pandemic end variants keep popping up? I’m starting see end sight. 

Sincerely,
Mama 11 month old daughter  Yeah, idiotic. Dutch need start treating COVID like it’s water-bore multi-institutional study, single dose parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)–based intranasal vaccine provided full protection COVID-19 **in animal models**. found vaccine able block animal-to-animal transmission novel coronavirus. study published journal Science Advances.

Sounds great get tested works humans too… Sounds like going real bad soon. first identified India last fall. awhile. mind asking, vaccine? condition makes immune system suppressed? I've looking recent vaccine breakthroughs new variant  counties, north central florida, like 20% range last looked. evidence Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 lower fatality rate wild-type They're happy poor results, fucking get it. they'll race defend obfuscate ever attempting question. nuts. thread full people going “well bet unreported cases wayyyyy higher!!” mean Probably yes.

But people go say stupid correlative anecdotes treat proof. 

“I mild chest pain 30 minutes week vaccine, definitely it!!”

It’s antivaxxer logic. Correlate everything bad vaccine. (Note; doesn’t mean vaccine couldn’t caused it, it’s bad practice immediately attribute it).

Higher someone claiming friends heart attack caused vaccine. evidence? “Well even friend speculates vaccine caused it”. believe tho.  Antivax used less 5% population. upwards 40% pretty interesting. question would work well.  see press conferences Roy Cooper gave last year?

Since live NC also know ended mask mandate CDC adjusted guidance late April/early May. Depends strain. recall correctly Pfizer vaccine 80% effective original strain 3 weeks first dose. It’s 30% effective Delta variant point. piece would like elaborate on? state least, gym open freeze dues. also allow membership cancellation via phone e-mail. 

I also know lot gyms require contracts anymore. older business model phased favor month month system. Could three consecutive F1 races full orange shirts anything it? Gotcha. Politicians listen donors/handlers tell do. don’t look evidence listen experts form conclusion.  Ok. Explain then. Asking genuinely. Explain statement. obviously feel strongly please go one extra step explain specifically believe conviction? think people careful cost freedom. Quarantine initially protecting elderly, wanted protect everyone irrational given death tole time. However, vaccine came, old susceptible got vaccine. So, better start shutting businesses rational first place definitely can't defended ""helping"" happens again. need conversation what's ""too far"" work given current climate. would great. delta strain less likely kill 

Did strain get promise that? CDC sure doesn’t make lethal

It's simply less lethal. People come assert less lethal without citation.

I know motivation this.  evidence Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 lower fatality rate wild-type people feel kind need pretend assert delta variants less fatal? That’s ~~percent~~ perfect description reflux (and/or hiatal hernia, also quite common) feels like. wouldn’t assume heart issues unless also fatigued, short breath, etc. think shitty metaphor actually ignoratio elenchi.

Look up! It’s actually reason you’re collecting votes. Well tht sucks data? 12 million Americans (including me) vaccinated J&amp;J. know percentage people getting sick vaccinated, hard get breakdown vaccines had. patchy anyways. Like brush fire, find dry grass keep burning. variant better finding leftover patches ""dry grass"".

In event, survivors immunized old fashioned way. Yup, you’re truly concerned, talk PCP it, people internet. 

No one going able diagnose heart condition (if one) text messages. You’d need ecg (likely wearable since it’s intermittent issue) minimum, maybe echo well. CDC Fauci said 2020 Americans need wear masks yet. ""at time"" mean? death toll reaches million time second dose? Where? FL? Alpha variant, contagious. Delta getting started, number anti-masker/anti-vaxxer, hoax proclaimers, they're surprise. India Indonesia shown level damage Delta unvaccinated groups 65. hope FL vaccination rates help limit community spread; that's it. FL already seeing 4 fold increase cases couple weeks back. Missouri's hospitalizations already overwhelming hospitals, I'm hopeful FL. Delta much contagious, people need realize this. Based great others wearing masks. Unfortunately wearing mask protects others you. little protect others.  Freedom = freedom dumb selfish wanna one stop Also watch people vaccine latch onto (when concerned 0.05% death rate whatever was)  Knowing basically everyone get enough? Rich, poor, famous elite. got same. personally haven’t caught I’m vaccinated actually first time life never really educated vaccines like parents weren’t like middle really hating also using since son thought taking care health lot hw say glad made choice won’t push anyone would recommend help equation like: [deaths year] - X (expected typical deaths per year). covid large-scale difference affecting mortality, attribute increase covid without actually counting individual cases.

It catches virus cases. It'll also count deaths lockdowns, depression disruptions services. complete picture overall effect virus population.  someone explain fuck China supposedly got rid covid basically without vaccines? Yeah know lie cases, due lack news assume really got control. Place origin, billions people, poor hygiene still got control!? COVID-19 statistically poses harm children. 0.005% infections lead deaths. Vaccinations still clinical trials, hundreds kids hospitalised myocarditis number vaccine-related deaths among ages. take risk vaccine? actually around efficacy delta variant ~60%.  Thats thing, want that, are. many dipshit anti vaccers causing undue harm chaos already less fortunate. logic applies jobs, one person fucks up, rules mandated EVERYONE, sucks good ones, good ones, bad ones.  New Dutch SARS-covid-2 variant : ‘the Delta-Works’. (Pun intended) Preliminary statistics show suicides, mass shootings, auto deaths way balance bit? Canada similar level vaccination Netherlands, full people clamoring total reopening right away. Looking data UK Netherlands could rough second half year. Florida ground zero soon! Everything back normal gyms pretty much everywhere else. little social distancing, masks worn. get pulled chest muscle. fun all. You’ll notice lot correlative bias discussions. 

People hyper vigilant something like vaccine. notice anything ordinary, you’re also far likely attribute (which also literal antivaxxer logic). 

The incidence always likely higher reported due undetected cases, “well got vaccine idk think mild chest pain weeks later” pretty much lowest bar evidence. 

Don’t get wrong, warrants research good indicator something *may* happening en masse. it’s also good evidence risk thousands times higher reported. 

Fun fact, one reason common side effects drugs (and vaccines) extremely similar -and vague- anything people report trials listed. Hence things headaches fatigue incredibly common side effects (and that’s say drugs don’t cause that). Boyfriend went arcade Netherlands, mask protocols sanitizer wipes near games. ones wearing masks. saw kids running around screaming noped there. It’s spreadable less lethal

Just cited less lethal. Link even newsworthy

People keep posting version ""the news"" without citation.   assume making exact argument killing one person per month. Natural selection kind glasses provide protection. Wear sunglasses inside need to. Guess Delta job getting people asses. think litereally idea Mexico like nowadays sometimes 50%+ positivity rates   oust

Inoculating populations COVID-19 highest priority nations across world 2021. Unfortunately, several countries find insufficient number shots fully vaccinate citizens; given vaccines require two doses. also suggested nasal vaccines may help prevent viral entry body (and infecting lungs). Getting two birds one stone, researchers reported single-dose intranasal COVID-19 vaccine provides full protection SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

""We developing vaccine platform 20 years, began working new vaccine formulations combat COVID-19 early days pandemic. preclinical data show vaccine protects infection, also significantly reduces chances transmission,"" said Dr. Biao He, co-leader study, statement. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, given 80% covid deaths 65+, I'm thinking better round. also speculated vaccine.

Real solid evidence there, mind set. Peer review found plausible bias here. 

What actually trying say line? 

This literally antivaxer logic. need worry dying hospitalized COVID. still 20% chance developing symptomatic COVID, judging data coming Israel, UK, places. clinical terms, symptomatic, would likely mild case, note mean mild colloquial sense term. means get sick, blood oxygen won’t drop 94%, may need outpatient treatment (but won’t hospitalized), could possibly develop long COVID, myocarditis, pulmonary issues, already happens asymptomatic cases. 

TLDR: Even vaccinated, want get COVID don’t to. good idea still take precautions like indoor masking spread control US vaccination rates rise.  Pfizer wants sell vaccines Viagra pills. Now, Tom weather. /s fucking go again. maybe they're downvoting misuse contraction data saw said still like 96% effective preventing hospitalization death delta 21 days first dose. longer case? first part got cut reason, seen it. whatever, citation full previously answered. 


As rest... Well, learned tomato **actually** domesticated, that's win everyone!  Yeah looks like classic data manipulation. would put exponential axis make confusing graphs? searched comment 10minutes 
I wondering comments made one mid June. stopped wearing masks places late May. I'll probably start wearing flu season. involve slightly higher heart rate? know someone went Mexico care father. father cousin gotten Covid, ended dying. taking care father, got infected along daughter. know decided do? Instead staying Mexico two weeks quarantine, daughter flew (in commercial PLANE) south Mexico Tijuana. pissed day dad told me. someone flips houses hires dad contractor remodel them. Thankfully, months working another project didn’t contact her. also told got back US, didn’t quarantine all. going knowing Covid.

I really mad thinking knowingly didn’t care infecting (or killing someone compromised immune system).  Okay one considers fully vaccinated single pfizer moderna shot...

The sources linked essentially shows fully vaccinated individual mrna sufficiently protected delta strain. consistent data delta variant reported around globe. Lol lol lol cracking up. Bravo sir bravo long though? think Long Covid. Nah, ffp2 mask stays glued face. Inside outside. Even shot nr 2. Heh freedumb day. Unfortunately 65% means get incidence 400 ICU beds 6.000 germany alone according recent figures RKI. 75% would mean incidence ""only"" 150 beds 2.000, 85% incidence 100, 95% 50 less 1.000 beds. So, every 2nd dose counts, currently we're 41,5% beginning see less interest vaccination. german source: page 7 J&amp;J phase 3 trials conducted South Africa also Brasil time local variants already dominant that’s official efficacy 66%. Pfizer Moderna conducted phase 3 trials set setting sure wouldn’t see efficacy anywhere near 90%. J&amp;J vaccine causing relatively strong immune reaction vaccine contains significantly antigen AZ based technology. story/parable/joke first thing came mind. Thanks posting Another example lockdown absolutism. possible answer people running amok locking up, right? think realize, maybe do, much crazy ass comments alienate people trying persuade. I'm favour UK willing global guinea pig interested see point herd immunity begins take effect. 

However high vaccination rate compared countries. think government stop British tourists travelling abroad. 

British tourists could start spreading covid around places well vaccinated currently. could prove quite damaging diplomatic relations notable outbreaks get linked back UK holiday makers. Please post links Discord server. check official Discord server menu tab.

Taiwan showed strong contact tracing quarantining measure work. That’s tin foil hat territory, it’s pretty much accepted fact. Even leaders heavy restrictions place finally made clear continued economic societal damage longer justifiable imperative everyone get vaccine. Here, high vaccination rates time point, become clear vaccines work advertised efficacies lighter exposure, longer term exposure closer contact, small party 10-40 people, 50-100% fully vaccinated people get virus. local news / happened people personally know several times last two months. AFAIK always one solitary unvaccinated infected person vector. get herd immunity, means stamping virus society less rather hitting vaccination percentages, people clubs tightly enclosed spaces like that.  Additionally yet know immunocorrelate covid, meaning antibodies could low sufficiently protected cells. Wait breakthrough infections... Stop positivity. vaccine program eu failure. vaccinated months ago. Incredibly dumb move open soon. Luckily majority new cases young people least end IC. issue people may sick didn’t get tested COVID. people get vaccinated sure. 
 
To use rather insistent analogy: 
Chicken pox fairly different diseases children get. doctor diagnosed time chicken pox, you’re probably safe getting chicken pox again. (Although definitely get shingles vaccine soon it’s available you.) remember getting spots feeling sick, diseases symptom yes, get vac one sure.

Netherlands reported average around 20 deaths per day average peak last wave, also around 8,300 cases average (23 April) significantly less vaccinated population (27.5% vs. 81% adults least partially vaccinated now). Currently 7-day average around 4,500 cases per day (but increasing rapidly).

So I'd say peak death wave &lt;20 deaths per day average, cases higher last wave, deaths cases among vulnerable population probably lower.  literally hear partying two floors right @Groningen localities buble now? new variants appear countries. needs happen new variant enter region.

There numbers. Someone came asserted ""95%"". 

I would like see numbers go assertion.  car accident can’t mutate start global shutdown again. family fully vaccinated mask areas could. live older relative also fully vaccinated. do? Honestly, I'm fully vaxxed I'm fighting non covid bout sinusitis bronchitis that's lasted week - I'm going back masking up. XD enjoyed getting sick anything once. Okay. Let's assume said true. Let's actually use cars example. Safety precautions cars cause less deaths, accidents yes, less deaths nonetheless. precautions we've implementing (masks, hygiene regimes, social distancing etc) keeping said risk low.

What vaccine get? angry

This narrated mind, reality.

Point part others ""get angry"". Look inwards. first shot. mRNA ones REALLY need second shot delta.  Also tested way week due requiring test leaving holiday, due also start school summer. test + less rules Made huge gap. Yeah I’m lot. wish lying :( It’s irresponsible hold olympics risk people’s lives stupid competition Feel free enlighten explicit examples talking about. plain stupid, health minister allowed. Delta variant much faster making copies body.

This means, even vaccinated, there's delay immune system gets alert sends proper responses.

Being vaccinated means immune system knows make special warheads designed kill SARS-CoV-2. called antibodies.

They work, Delta head start (faster variants) making copies alarm goes off.

Going Delta much worse unvaccinated. Really helpful, thanks lot. Definitely first. Rollout likely proceed like initial vaccination. goal vaccine prevent severe disease first spread second. 

If first goal looks like it’s risk focus naturally would vaccinated still high risk variants. Following probably expand groups get boosters.

This really prevent another load hospitals like saw last year. Many haven’t recovered loss manpower, burnout, overall strain internal infrastructure.

If give vaccine keeps hospital bed that’s one bed another healthcare emergency. one ounce prevention worth world cure everyone else doesn’t COVID needs medical services. Superb post go [Dayton Swim 我不討厭中國。 There’s link page leads article JandJ effective well Thank you! too!

Thank you. Thanks follow up.  Chinese vaccine designers publish results sense priority.

My country buying cansino vaccine, viral vector efficacy like 68% preventing symptomatic disease, know Pakistan country reported efficacy vaccine pharmaceutical company. Yeah seems like something would pretty easy pull off. Also seems like something CDC would understandably want data re: efficacy/safety first Nah political defintion arose twentieth century simply mean “a state neither aligned West (first world) East/Soviets (second world).” obviously definition isn’t one.

Under common, popular definition, still isn’t. third world state endemic starvation, endemic lack access water sanitation, endemic lack infrastructure healthcare, median incomes often lower $1 day, etc. Endemic key word - Flint, Michigan didn’t clean water years doesn’t make entire USA third world country. made headlines *insane* could occur place like America. third world country wouldn’t even blip news nation would condition worse.  Also used different definition efficacy hard compare numbers directly other. source 99.7% number? thought CDC stopped tracking vaccinated cases get number San Diego? San Diego’s city data shows it’s higher that, unless I’m misinterpreting it. Staff 800 around 400 got vaccained already (saw intranet hospital ) personal choice get vaccained.

Don't expect get one young healthy.  remember hearing argument antivaxers 20 years ago. explain…no vaccine 100% effective. people legit medical reasons prevent getting vaccine. people running around spreading Covid, likely vaccinated person exposed certain percentage get it.. like vaccinated people are, unvaccinated people protected. addition, virus spreads, evolves eventually vaccine could ineffective evolved versions virus. covid antibody test differentiate antibodies infection vs antibodies vaccine?

I tested positive covid antibodies yesterday, also vaccinated March. spoke doctor said test took cannot tell difference two types antibodies. asked test COULD tell difference, also said no.

However, I’ve checked like 5 seemingly reputable sources online, every single one said otherwise. I’m wondering doctor either uninformed, or… understand question.

Did read original post? actually what's worse they're administering Sinovac, terrible efficacy even alpha variant . They're looking give booster shots another vaccine, they're Turkey. You’re vaccinated J&amp;J. read article today talking effectiveness delta variant.  Well sure, Sweden isn’t imposing public activity restrictions way highly contagious variant like delta variant comes along, it’s got much much much opportunity spread country like ours...though might see problem spring western provinces start drop restrictions Delta starts get found here. 

Really, might seeing absolute worst timing here. We’ll see. What's definition third world state? Sounds like one. Lol yes do. reported cases paperwork testing diagnose it. Mines reported  many parents kids wear masks indoors right now, really crazy see. &lt; 12 can't get vaccine US defense masking social distancing. Suicides overdoses etc certainly comment parents unable find vaccine location local removed political? Red blue, think important people get vaccine get it. Theres reason want vaccinated paying price choose to... make political, ultimately often vote free Healthcare want pay freedoms. Nothing emberrassed two people tested positive fully vaccinated, whole ship wasn’t ship 162 guests, fully vaccinated. According City Borough Juneau press release, flying Juneau arrive. also 52 crew members, fully vaccinated.   like misinformed trying sabotage efforts suppress pandemic? Totalitarian surveillance states get shit done They're getting vaccine. Vaccines expiring districts. st. Louis Kansas city insane numbers, rural areas.   I've feeling really surrounded lot people take Covid19 seriously even antivaxxers, comment made laugh thanks lot. ""PREVENTION VIRAL INFECTIONS VACCINES ""

Make Maine beautiful again, right thing.  big CDC change May, dropping restrictions vaccinated people, interpreted 'the pandemic US' (regardless one's personal vaccination status). still rolling dice, delta now. reductionist take Won’t end imo, people get sooner later vaccines stuff Well, yeah, hence frustration. it’s effective need tell us ignore us. wouldn’t say it’s nothing worry  idiot governor completely ignore data. long Florida's tourism rates stay keeps raking money, give shit many suffer die.

As leader private medicine, MedLife concerned public health actively involved pandemic monitoring, conducting extensive studies Romanian doctors, biologists researchers. Thus, April 2020, first largest study Central Eastern Europe degree natural immunization population COVID-19 started, showed that, time, collective immunity Romania low, 2%. following months pandemic, medical service provider MedLife carried less 9 studies, resources without help public institutions, constantly returning new information evolution SARS-CoV-2 strains Romania , dynamics antibodies acquired result infection vaccination, well intention vaccinate Romanians.

In fact, currently working first study region evaluates cellular immune response COVID-19. soon return crucial information evolution pandemic regarding resistance went disease new reinfection. addition, assess potential illness hospitalization, including risk death people gone disease vaccinated. now, clear Romania become case study Delta strain, relatively small number vaccinated people, half European average, large number people gone disease "", concluded Mihai Mark, President CEO MedLife Group 
\*\*\*

 
The MedLife Medical System operator truly concerned public health since beginning pandemic, conducting less 9 studies exclusively funds resources, Romanian doctors researchers. Thus, company provided authorities imported information natural immunization population, national level specific outbreaks, dynamic evolution antibodies COVID-19, origin SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating Romania, transmission presence strains. 


 
MedLife's investment research amounts two million euros since beginning pandemic. research program carried exclusively company's funds. 


 
The company continues invest research, first study region following cellular immune response COVID-19, results crucial evolution pandemic. According MedLife doctors, degree collective immunity urban level 60% population, respectively 6 7 million inhabitants, cities represent 54% Romanian population.

Romania become important nursery Europe investment tourism. is, however, conditioned rapid increase vaccination rate. 
Based information study, MedLife submit concrete measures authorities next week increase vaccination rate, targeted, also surprising information evolution pandemic.

Actively involved research activities since beginning pandemic, MedLife Medical System conducted new study, research division, assess degree immunization acquired naturally following vaccination Romania, urban level. research carried representative sample 943 people, residents cities different characteristics terms vaccination rate infection rate: Bucharest, Cluj, Constanta, Timisoara - area 1, respectively Giurgiu, Suceava Piatra Neamt - area 2.

In order determine antibody titer COVID-19, anti-Spike RBD (protein fragment) IgG serological tests performed Abbott analytical systems, quantitatively measuring level antibodies anti-Nucleocapsitis IgG (qualitatively) confirming refuting presence antibodies.

“We make public results new research approach carried entirely resources exclusively MedLife doctors specialists. data show level collective immunity urban level 60%, respectively 6-7 million people, indicates major evolution immunization rate, given May last year we, MedLife, announce, first time, immunity Romanian population COVID-19 2%. Moreover, extrapolate data take account rural environment, probably talking 10-12 million Romanians went disease vaccinated. However, time relax. Studies Delta strain show unequivocally natural immunity, obtained passing disease, effective front new Delta strain. Wave 4 closer originally thought, probably month have, again, thousands cases day much infectious strain.

There one solution: vaccination. high level natural immunization accompanied equally high rate immunity vaccination, Romania would probably done well Europe. vaccination campaign proved excellently organized, particular good territorial coverage availability vaccine stocks, need even greater increase terms communication, ie collective involvement institutions, political class, business people, media, artists, civil society inform population importance phenomenon increase, shortest possible time, vaccination rate. prioritize vaccination next period,, said Mihai Marcu, President CEO MedLife Group.

Three times people urban areas infected SARS-CoV-2 virus compared official reports. figures growing alarmingly medium small urban areas

The study MedLife specialists shows three times people large urban areas infected SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared official reports reflect universe individuals gone disease taken PCR test. order confirm diagnosis. Thus, according serological tests performed approach carried MedLife, 34% population investigated big cities exposed COVID-19 infection since onset pandemic now. these, half likely asymptomatic. Moreover, study shows 50% population small urban areas went disease, nine times official reports.

&amp;#x200B;

 
However, situation remains worrying Romania, given people gone disease vaccinated good chance re-infected new strains coronavirus circulation. Also, unlike Western European countries, population age 60, exposed severe disease, including hospitalization even death, chosen vaccinated much lesser extent.

I something similar first shot. Went ER, ran ringer tests would reveal myocarditis, nothing showed up. Symptoms went away next day, chalked anxiety. would still get checked concerning you. Ohhh...would still work put high pressure squirt gun? want get vaccinated? Asking friend.  point people going accept it. aren’t vaccinated catch it, that’s fault. can’t go rest lives paranoid Covid numbers. Everything already 100% masks am. cares point.

Either you’re lying you’re ignorant. I'm going go limb say far common think. people experience chest pain get told doctors anxiety report anything.

I'm sure this. understand, clinical myocarditis symptoms quite extreme, would usually lead investigations doctor.

For example, milder symptoms myocarditis typically presents month ago (heart palpitations slight shortness breath) went ER tele nurse instructed to. Since two cardiac symptoms paired together, admitted, given EKG almost immediately, later got blood taken, chest x-ray ER doctor checked heart. even stay hour tests done observe. tests came back fine (I've chalked anxiety). point is, someone severe cardiac symptoms (I've heard myocarditis painful full blown heart attack) likely waved away. Man dunno heart inflammation ever mild. never good heart inflammation lol. something healthy ever Okay.

Sunk cost fallacy try mask shopping. definitely comfy options there. Surgeons wear 8+ hour surgeries...

An airplane recycled air place masks required quite time IMO. people mild cases lingering symptoms.

This mean Long Covid correlated severity infection

isn't true.  sucks people care cared first place, would done newer link? one indicates 7 asymptomatic 2 mild  First I've heard that, know. great true. heard colleagues India, people pretty adamant WhatsApp forwards factual. 

Yeah utilization remdesivir steroids tragic. situation snake oil doctors selling fake vaccines Minister Olivier Véran : brief translation ""Masks useless unless sick"" sorry hear that! Breakthrough cases vaccination happen, that's need high vaccination rate, idea opening got plain stupid. Get well soon, take care.

which vaccine friends get?  Driving home first shot Hearing radio best feeling. Let's hope I'm safe 14th August. 50 yesterday, 77 today, expect 100 tomorrow. Unless something done doesnt take long time go thousand day. rather think humanity whole larger scale hope cheer death. 

We know death rate 5yo unusually high Delta Africa. share preconditions babies. since starting spread, see update data soon home area. They'll probably verification app thing. fact, would surprised Japan *didn't* something like that. fair, population Iceland much smaller

If we're fair, compare small states US Iceland. North &amp; South Dakota seeing high higher percentages considering availability vaccines Iceland longer. Yet lagging fully vaxxed couple last month traveled Iceland tested positive 5th day quarantine

Please link story. can't find it. Thanks. hesitant pretty recently. Things already open time time started pushing app. GEKOLONI… dit tempo zijn volgende week woensdag allemaal dood.  Personally use power autism. Yet new restrictions introduced days ago infections sky rocketed, make masks mandatory again. think government reintroduce least closed spaces… brother law long covid. suffering last year neurological symptoms. engineer can't concentrate 2 minutes. short term memory shot. can't work. loss QOL absolutely devastating. think know talking 2 cents on: never end. Boosters lockdowns years. Passport checks every want go.

Yes, virus us long long time, maybe indefinitely. Boosters probably needed, like flu vaccine. Lockdowns? No. trying get rid helped enormously people like could comply little bit. Passport checks etc. possible. still check tuberculosis instance people coming abroad. Covid like that, problem. problem lockdowns. way get rid quickly possible. hindered people like you. get passionate hatred towards China, 5% fully vaccinated, barking SinoVac missing boat.

5% vaccinated. Also, Sinovac needs 2 shots effective. Please keep politics /r/worldnews say true, based population responded date, reasonable expect high vaccine takeup NZ supplies available. right end year latest. Kkr Hybrid working way forward. found training new staff, especially younger apprentice types difficult remotely. Also nothing beats team meet person. Video calls cut it! couple days office per weeks right . There's lot evidence J&amp;J works well.  study South Africa found 94% breakthrough infections vaccinated J&amp;J mild 2% severe.  South Africa beta variant laboratory studies vaccines, including J&amp;J, showed resistant variants vaccines.  numbers delta almost certainly even better this. J&amp;J used much less around world vaccines huge amount data available others.  still pretty obvious available job well.  significant amount people vaccinated J&amp;J hospitalized would heard now.  There's enough J&amp;J vaccinations enough delta infections something noticeable point problem. disease really doesn’t affect kids much. We’ve known since day one. can’t expect follow rules, it’s ridiculous. someone immunocompromised that’s different story, generally blanket restrictions need stop. utterly scary Indonesia going right too.

Reminds mood /r/lucknow Uttar Pradesh hit couple months ago. sub entirely pleas hospital space medical oxygen.

The pandemic real university says mandatory get covid vaccine. student covid vaccine one provided campus. student refuses vaccine without appropriate exemption student dropped attendance completely. yes despite vaccine FDA approved fact mandatory states schools including university Well elsewhere spread, countryside. probably still circulating varying levels different parts rural India, know health infrastructure poor compared cities many tests conducted even people get sick succumb. know trying edgy clever, described libel.  Also logistics (distribution vaccine) Less deadly sure. Viruses general destined weakened survive without killing host. stage, vaccines necessary except people high risk. yeah :/ decided get MagSafe wallet phone doesnt fit, sits car ill bring know ill need it. wallet-sized working apple google make add-on wallet (i dont remember google pay sort wallet equivalent store non-payment cards, loyalty cards gift cards, etc) pretty fucking dumb run cruise without ensuring staff fully vaccinated staff beforehand. 

Tell Florida. dont want cruise companies ban unvaccinated customers even occur me. bet I'll fax every establishment want enter Japan. That's even get fucking shots next decade lol

Such shitshow here. also percentages total population, 16s getting vaccine. We're 11% Australia fully vaccinated, shy 33% one dose (so 22% population one dose second). difference one two doses drag bit us used Oxford-AstraZenaca early 60s, greater lag first second dose. Jup, lot's parties Ontario Canada similar population Netherlands 200 cases yesterday, messed up.  suspect kill rates defined age groups vary time variant. Honestly read much India, India getting outpaced China 90's 2000's mean stagnation.

India still huge problems got independence sizable industrial base, quickly pushed space program USSR's France's assistance, stimulated key industries like pharmaceutical 1960's partial reforms 90's stimulate/open market today major global player drugs manufacturing. [Breach paywall archive.is: link  Currently happening, sadly. [Breach paywall archive.is: link kids aren’t. [18th said reason suspect hospitalizations, opening would problem. 

They also said ok take masks (inside, never wear outside) people could stay 1.5 meters away other.

At time, expected infections continue fall, although noted uncertainty mid- long-term.

On [2nd (!!) still see coming. noted uncertainty, added drop hospitalizations 'might stagnate' July/August due delta.

The thing see behavior latest report research willingness teenagers vaccinated, would help stop spread.

The rest report mostly hypothetical situations. 

In latest reports (the last urgent report published yet), say stay vigilant new outbreaks come up, government take appropriate measures. 

Main problem - many people's view - OMT advice government kinda pushing lenient, due pressures open economy. cases, way government communicated advice wrong (""sure, go club day receive Janssen vaccine""). cases, stretched measures (40 hours test event instead recommended 24). 

I'm following scientists twitter already predicted end May (!!) would could hard spike due delta, i.e. restrictions still lot stronger. scientists mostly right previous waves (at least right government/OMT). seems like OMT near-sighted attributes weird exclusive status Dutch, happened UK delta would never happen here. 

I think there's good chance people part OMT working hard year half chance see real people behaved cities public transport. mostly doctors, virologists, infectiologist, micro-biologists. 2 epidemiologists far see, field epidemiologists experience working countries epidemics, knowing people respond measures government. 

This turned bit rant, I'm frustrated government handled pandemic, many fellow citizens seem grasp concept exponential growth. many smart people, really touch data, data RIVM OMT have, horrified thought opening 2 weeks ago, many people saw coming. cabinet says: ""we see coming"". charge smokers more.  Yeah problem also keeps mutating/evolving variants stronger vaccine. Canada cases trending (at least BC everything reopened mask mandate removed). auto mod. must said keyword. may misunderstood it, normal infection rate go despite vaccinations? thought vaccinations could help prevent harsher symptoms, infection itself? anyone really surprise though Yes herd immunity lot vaccinated people, make difference. 
Not Netherlands, don’t enough vaccinated, won’t get second 2020. 
That’s expectation. negative people seem celebrate news like show fears negativity. 
People still get hospitalised even dying, numbers before. think Ireland first % total population plays disadvantage: non-eligible children. Dutchman living Germany, wholeheartedly agree ask me, started places high population density mobility high - big cities first metropolitan areas, available everyone areas. I'm expert.. choice, right. exercise right, forced vaccinate. Lol. aren’t. It’s dictatorships always try cram “democratic” “republic” many times name country possible. NK even got “people’s” somehow, implied two, doesn’t mean anything. give - International trade could reasonably blocked. infections take place road side cafes.

S. Korea excelled testing contact tracing. Netherlands miserably failing many months both. absolutely need let carnival happen. remember interview Van diesel s. Korea year ago. said using masks huge mistake. Dropping everything Delta variant began take hold knowing much contagious is, pissed off. 

So ridiculous. Rules relaxed bit, noooooooo, everyone acts like pre-covid. masks, disinfecting hands shopping carts, distance. Quick, let’s go Spain, deserve it. Dutch smart, really show stupidity here. Please give us thoughts prayers. honestly great question I've never seen good answers to. 

I feel like people around treat masks like sort invincibility shield, really aren't. Certainly reduce risks. certain situations (e.g., hours enclosed room people) become less reliable? find way thinking way simple minded. reopening festivals clubs would alright people followed rules. 

I've vaccinated tested showed proof entry, however people take QR codes. bouncers even check people positive come in. mind could argue responsible, point bring responsibility drunk youth told finally party 1.5 years. cases dropped 600 population almost 19m. need test / vaccinate.   get another shot want. ways protected, better. Hence system test let's go REALLY work. Looks like vaccines really effective say.... 13 year old apparently died inflamed heart. yes BENEFITS. I’m whole “marketplace ideas” thing. Cool theory, practice, marketplace doesn’t value what’s true, spreads fastest easiest.

I think it’s time start balancing right say want right constantly inundated lies propaganda. think weather huge impact. Smear. 100% pure smear. could gone merits case make happen, instead, smear.

100% proven technique.

See, day Florida still manipulating data make Covid ""less scary"". Whatever reputation Jones, allegations sound extremely true match available evidence.

Given know De Santis, Trump, Republicans, huge lies told Covid, 100% believe her.

We dealing mass negligent murderers covering tracks. Spot Personally, I'd rather see policy dependent vaccination status. 

It may bit administratively difficult, think would incentivize parents get children vaccinated come significant costs safety. Plus (unlike stores) schools could actually get vaccination records, policy could enforced.

And, speaking personal experience, masks really costs comes learning. people's voices muffled loud-ish HVAC systems, made significantly harder hear understand professors/peers. vaccine get?  Anyway, curious see virus spreads countries truly vaccinated, 2/3 population like Israel UK.

It depends approval vaccine children. get really high vaccination rates without vaccinating children. Portugal enough vaccines yet, 25 year olds mostly even get date first shot yet, vaccinate fast gets vaccines in.

But keep mind percentage population required herd immunity depends -r- pathogen. Delta infectious, need higher percentages.

Children really important - relative imunity also interesting. little digging, seems Janssen Dutch equivalent Johnson, guy company named connection Johnsons J&amp;J.

Also really Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, three them. What’s fatality rate? campaigns like organized small private companies, nothing large scale. 

But let's honest here, unless Government shells cash money every person gets vaccine, 2 beers convince large group people get it.

I'm super surprised number cases Romania gone yet. vaccinated people spread well! matter “spread” Lol. else could mean? welcome think want. Sounds great get tested works humans too…

There Finnish company called Rokote Laboratories nasal spray vaccine called FinCoVac, product proceeding phase phase II human trials. See following article Exactly post ironic NL? Maybe. Germany said ""Old people,and people preconditions die easier Covid"". vaccine given freely doctors. Due cooling many corrupt doctors.

In priorization group (I any) clearly communicated. register (if any, like family) managed federal states. Hessen okayish. enter data website, got two vaccination dates suggestion, could accept ask dates. Hardly complicated acceptable realize deal you, millions people.

Generally, vaccination system capable (throughput wise) vaccine producers.

So, bureaucratic, extremely. Oh god, whole case COVID … ever Ignorance.

These people think 100% test trace country set system people test get QR code enter clubs disco's events.

Then kids screenshotting qr codes friends get in. Securitypeople front events see scanner QRcode used 2 times last minute. supposed check QR code ID person QR code give first 2 letters name birthdate, apparently fool proof.

Then club owners administered home fast tests antigen ones.

And clubs could enter back 5 euro's kid not.

Nothing works let one positive trough. weeks, Jansen (J&amp;J) vaccine green go day 1.

Some clubs cluster 100's infected still hear mask recommendations coming back supermarkets. disastrous government already fallen twice, still get rule us.

I mad everything nothing fuck young kids give em long covid life. recent study Singapore also suggests vaccination provides pretty good protection severe Covid-19 disease Delta Singapore study found COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna) provides 69 per cent protection infection Delta variant coronavirus, regardless symptoms, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Wednesday (Jul 7).
Citing study National Centre Infectious Diseases (NCID) Ministry Health (MOH), said data also showed vaccine's protection symptomatic disease “between 80 90 per cent”.
“Effectiveness vaccination severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen supplementation, ICU (intensive care unit) care death, 93 per cent,” added.  don’t want see impact.. fine lets use latest RIVM week up-date. Lets start page 20: 55% infected 15 24. 
Page 26: 19% infected bars/clubs. Add 10% TvT positives almost 1 3!!! directly related bars clubs. Another 35% infections comes family, can’t guess much related children going must percent conservatively calculated.
Stick head sand want, numbers don’t lie pretty fucking dumb run cruise without ensuring staff fully vaccinated staff beforehand. suggesting unused doses go EU distribution again?

I suggesting cna judge current numbers willingness Europeans vaccinated. Denmark Ireland got jump others got fair share EU vaccine purchase agreement, might well find second others vaccines become plentiful.

Romania might come regret used vaccines, problem.

And different kind share agreement might fair, less private deals states one country want would shared equally among others interested. Going strong 9% adult population vaccinated. target end 2023.

\- Australian. balls say anyone adult wanted get first vaccine already got one waiting 1 month already spot open make appointment get first jab.

Because aparantly fucking calenders work 2 weeks ahead.


Fuck. You. Mark Hugo. imagine China... ""Told so""

Guess expect public healthy safety measures rolled back Euro Cup running herd immunity achieved  Hey guys 17 10 months born 2003. anyway get vaccine since immediate requirement me?  advice ATAGI, 12 week gap first second doses recommended, based clear data offers maximum protection durability. 

In low COVID environment, considered optimal dosing schedule, remains advice country.

Given recent Sydney outbreak, advice area bring second dose forward, trading maximal protection (still good) protection getting second dose sooner. 

As facts ground change, risk-benefit trade off. expert advice updated reflect that. 

I’d like think people average intelligence would able understand this, adapt updated advice pandemic evolves. 

Then get internet , realise I’m probably optimistic.  I'm flying Amsterdam Saturday. Fuck life. theres literally 2000 types cold almost impossible vaccinate it. Maybe someday they'll able make something universal dunno....

There's Meanwhile rest central Europe phasing mask mandates, social distancing guidelines allow dine even 

Except nightclubs, still things new restriction implemented. thing like last summer, feels like groundhog day.


Except vunerable people vaccinated, should't cause much problems. awesome! Thanks much. QR code scanned shows name person clubs verify QR code ID person. entry someone elses QR code possible clubs check match. Yeah no, thought getting needle nose makes panic attack Yes increase high, went last 5 weeks 700 100 hospital worries. Yes number slightly increase, point ones sick young people chose vacinated like said worries, restricitions come back likely negative vacation advice. That's happened Netherlands... mRNA vaccines 80-90% effective symptomatic infection delta, adenovirus vaccines around 60-70%

There lot people getting sick even though fully vaccinated, that's simple statistical inevitability combination incompetence, corruption, focus scoring cheap votes every opportunity, populism, valuing short term economic gains public health (even long term economy would served beyter careful).

Our past three governments steadily breaking social security, mental regular health care, semblance wealth equality, attempts protecting environment, mamy more. name neo-liberalism free market. Unfortunately sizable bunch voters see issue continue vote parties. 

So necessarily something changed recently, cracks decade shitty government simply starting show.

For record: Im pretty far left (by Dutch standards) there's bias here, job also research systemic issues around Dutch public health. Two things keep mind:

- antivacs crowd specific US, thing Europe too.

- US got way better earlier access vaccines Europe (except UK, lots vaccines early too) member SAGE (the UK Scientific Advice Group) spoke radio yesterday say Delta sent 250% number people hospital Alpha per infection. one even paid it, equivalence new U2 album Leave bad mental health. Get vaccinated eligible area. That's really need know think people aversion needles. blame everything that. Oh, insertions/deletions happen \*all time\*. PhD comparing peptide sequences deriving phylogenetic trees. Even things tree viruses there's mechanisms checking DNA replication insertions/deletions sections peptides really really common. I've even seen cases parsimonious tree involved deletion followed insertion.

It's evolution works. Honestly there's absolutely nothing see here. can't even say wanna say without getting banned lol. primarily mask lift + young people going bars without 1.5 distancing. graph government it’s like 70-75% 10-29 yet fully vaccinated. testing actively get clubs. soon government reinstated lockdown test numbers go down. gov app happens, nobody go holidays travel companies suffer too.

Who owns Dutch vacation parks hotels? blame 100% Astrazeneca still delivering promised J&amp;J putting trust shitty shifty vaccine factory US. ""full protection""? 100% efficacy? Doubt. protection Covid good (95%) many health workers dying?

I'm afraid understanding statistics work 95% efficiency means. multiplying probabilities together, compare prior probability observed (actual) probability order determine effect change probability makes. 

You understand people telling gut feeling wrong spend time maths class probabilities work. would recommend following: [Khan Academy: Compound probability independent mean condescending, however something understood without learning maths underpinning it. upside, gives much better understanding many things world properly applied. solution immunocompromised? kids parents are? experience COVID scientist matched experiences outlined article. Perhaps sufficiently photogenic? Yeah believe right. Let's hope hospitalizations stay low. can't post without removed, since ideó logy functionaries. I'm exact position! think 13 yo able handle another year home I'm going attempt send her. Shes fully vaccinated thankfully, knows wear mask idc peers think. pull virtual again.

Wow sucks...do know may caught it? hope okay 😔 sure didn’t misspell Fresno? living life tho? J&amp;J. Janssen really, made Leiden, NL. Ebola? still know comes 18 years serious attempts started find it.  good point. Retrospective studies looking HIV showed turning odd places decades became pandemic 80s Depends part California. Central Valley easily hit highs 100-110 degrees summer. also wildfire season air quality makes unhealthy outside.   Mine exposure tracking app mobile phone. implausible Europe/Germany faster countries thing involves solid, simple digital， must outliers. UK planning give booster shots elderly autumn/winter. known favoured option many countries. around 99% everywhere. story keeps repeating over, people want vaccine point consequences them. obviously underestimated magnitude short term peak.

They didn't. care. really think government epidemiologists crunched numbers? Infect young, one dosis Pfizer enough, carry on. Money money money Rutte's mantra. could happen time

That's happen again. Viruses jumping species us regularly since started farming Neolithic - Ebola even need farmers, Hunter/Gatherers eating bushmeat. 

 one many things found exasperating Lab Leak hypotheses - sure scientific reasoning can't dismiss it, given happened tens thousands times last 10,000 years need better evidence Just-So story appeals human psychology. youth, hospitalizations, nothing see here, carry people.   live USA? , check County health department vaccines, lot times programs people get vaccinated access ( primary care provider, etc) cards 

People smartphones US? Europe get QR code show door. Got covid already, mild cold personally. care anymore. That’s happens cultivate low-trust society makes looting easier cronies  underrated comment ↑   Except everyone 40 can't get recommended vaccine supply. Could great pets, cats dogs known catch coronavirus owners. Like animorphs? Aye, there's difference **A** Hanta virus **THE** hanta virus - I'm pointing out. arguments opening frustrating too. ""THESE POOR BUSINESSES DYING"", even though delivery, collections takeaway thing. think people fail realize dead people buy pints completely ignore whole ""we're closed prevent deaths"" thing.


That said, Jannsen mRNA opened younger crowds, think hit August, we'll good place consider reopen.


July early second vaccination longer 2 weeks getting covid?
Did expect would serious illness fully vaccinated.
Good luck stay strong! Happens time 😂 1) Agreed.
2) completely disingenuous, long term data virus medication simply exist. must say surprised guys reaction loosening restrictions. 

I heard need wear masks anymore (in shops something) many people would tell others take masks ""want hebben onze vrijheid terug"" (because freedom back). 

I mean happen Belgium. might think real nut jobs would tell people something like this.

It weird me. agree crying redditors younger people corona right including almost feel nothing Went Roermond outlet two weeks ago, people wear masks, even shops. thought Dutch beaten Covid.... Guess not. lost. debate. confusing reaction novel virus cure treatment vaccination effort. mixing two different things together spin narrative weird way. 

The vaccine safe effective easy way everything widely adopted. We've eradicated disease like methods. ""two weeks prevent huge death toll"" mode anymore. weak vulnerable. obvious solution. blessed vaccine. heading misleading. company says mask protects *equally much* Delta original strain. Israeli mask company Sonovia released report showing trademark SonoMask equally protective Delta variant original Wuhan strain.

Which absolute nonsense claim. could also say “Social distancing protect Delta variant”. “Any mask protect wearers Delta variant”. “Magic crystals equally protective Delta variant original Wuhan strain”. I.e. all. Meanwhile Singapore, 0 local cases yesterday 1 local case today  One thing, Denmark 12.7% non-eligible children, Spain 11.3% Portugal 10.2% (the lowest Europe, think). Denmark needs quite better reach % total. Dutchie here. hate fucking government fucking assholes fully went out, barely vaccinated.

Selfish pricks. can't get vaccine standing club 6 hours later expecting work. assholes like: Yeah know corona got falsified test, want miss party.

I hope get sued fraude.  Welcome #johnsonvariant might hesitancy younger people

As far know not. take long vaccinate younger age groups.

We vaccinate fast get vaccines. take weeks, maybe couple months.

True r, delta clearly infectious, since reproduces earlier. globally widespread anyway future variants covid likely going descendants delta. variant outcompetes nice prospect. Stupidity eagerness please overlords. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Politicians confusing good luck good management.

And get positions rapidly changing (12 weeks 6 weeks).

There many politicians (federal state) burnishing political narrative time. agree, children crucial. Portugal lucky fewer children Europe. pace, population pyramid Portugal narrows quite bit 40 years old might hesitancy younger people, take long vaccinate younger age groups.

We know yet ""r"" associated Delta, pathogens really intrinsic ""r"" depends environment. Assuming restrictions (back pre-Corona way life), different populations might need different vaccinated percentages reach herd immunity. It’s young folks, mostly unvaccinated, partying large groups indoors, combined Delta variant. Even though tested entry, always going false negatives. don’t think growth rate representative Dutch society large – won’t see transmission supermarket office – it’s get create ideal conditions virus spread. think anymore warm weather plays big role. days NL long time year weather bad past 2 weeks. However think restrictions crucial probably reason RO less cases now. Australian here. People truly everything don’t give fuck anymore. wife gets yelled customers tries enforce masks QR code check ins. People become feral it’s saddening predictable people politicised instead addressing it. thing real spike protein slipping in. weakened virus part virus produced way virus could possibly survive. risk would also posed spike protein live virus could replicate happen.

Not saying risk vaccine compared risk virus risk catching still minor. Again? never stopped 😅 kind feels like take opportunity shit government 

I mean, keep fucking time time repeated criticism justified. gross incompetence 'new rules pretty clear, nightclubs responsibility scan QR code check ID valid. responsibility company, checking ID 18. couple nightclubs fucked check ID's ruined rest us. 

""A couple nightclubs"" account 10k+ daily cases. TvT inherently flawed (it expensive yet terrible non-functioning system even perfect world without cheating), legally letting vaccinated parties day first shot (""dansen met Jansen"") incomprehensively dumb. could reopened slowly sticking original plan (perhaps allowing additional easing OUTDOOR) achieving vaccination milestones, no, relax measures time, barely third population fully vaccinated. light countries Europe playing safe policy maker thought: ""hmm perhaps think punish HARD mean like really fucking HARD. 

Ok, also punish incompetent morons charge responsible policy simply can't say lets keep everything closed bad actors. cases 200 per day, open point fuck would ever open up?

Most outdoor openings probably fine. lifted indoor restrictions bit longer, reach vaccination targets. We're even far anymore. Like, what, 6-10 weeks? everyone eligible chance get fully vaccinated yet. point, means, open completely. mostly individual responsibility. family treating like this. It’s depressing people assume you’re 100% advocating vaccine 100% time MUST it. much reason people. bots, whatever are. that, article ineffective delta variant  recent study conducted Northern Thailand revealed Sinovac vaccine’s efficacy among health personnel **ineffective** **82.8% affective** preventing infections delta variant.

If 82.8% infection prevention considered ineffective, Pfizer reported efficacy 64% 69% Delta variant, reported Israel Singapore respectively... cases already rising US aren’t woods yet.

We enjoying Camelot moment low-transmission season half country vaccinated. Even that, Missouri impression May 2020.

Once autumn rolls in, anti-vaxxers still thing, we’re going back dark time.

And, yes, Dr Fauci warned about: two America’s. eventually, dumb America help spread new variants point smart America struggling again.

We chance avoid it, good portion country lost minds don’t see happening. Paying? 

I mean vaccines already free insurance, no? 

Or mean covid care general. fair though, SA Liberals probably mark left NSW Labor, certainly left NSW Liberals. Yup. know that. 95 percent. least variants. significantly lower. also know vaccinated people indeed hospitalized. even died. also told impossible. Obviously not. “many Asian countries” particular? Y'all getting boosters, can't even get Pfizer shot Australia yet due supply issues. I'm fucking gaslighting. research found 300 cases 177,000,000. Yes probably diagnosed, still, incredibly unlikely common people thread claiming. trust more, scientific research random internet strangers?   missing something 99.909% good enough?

Yes missing something, .1% people getting infected vaccine equal 99.9% efficacy. would mean virus infected 100% people vaccine. That's trials set control groups, gauge actual effectiveness vaccine.

For example Pfizer study around 30k people believe. 30k think split 15k, 15k terms got vaccine got placebo (I'm concerned right trial size example). 15k got Pfizer 8 infected. Now, logic would mean .053% people got infected would mean Pfizer efficacy 99.947% right? Well announce vaccine 95% effective? everyone control group got infected. control group 162 cases. vaccine prevented 154 cases, thus 154/162 95.06% efficacy. 

Before ask cannot say Sinovac roughly similar Pfizer 99.909% quite close 99.947% quoted figures efficacy dependent local infection rates time etc.

Link Pfizer press release got efficacy data from. Note obviously vs original strain example explain efficacy assertion incorrect. Obviously know efficacy Sinovac without seeing control group compare to: probably referring preliminary reports came Israel.

That said, majority evidence shows Delta limited immune escape, reduction efficacy relatively marginal. That's efficacy works. compare unvaccinated control group. mum trialling 1 az 1 Pfizer Sorry hear. 

How friends doing? symptoms, etc.

Esp curious ones vaccinated. Thank sharing  Free speech great theory, ones fucked ideas get power back speech. 

Ideologically, wonder ethicists point view is. Ultimate freedom speech even damages us individually society large, restrict “the greater good”? 

The longer live planet, think internet ends one universes “great filters”. Erosion science politics caused free spread info…

There notion people free say believe want, belief equally valid everyone else’s. aspects life, unfortunately isn’t case. 

Of course trying police massive slippery slope inevitably ends disaster someone. 

All reminds tolerance paradox. Sure, even real number ten fold higher still rather small.

*Absolute numbers nearly useless.

*The number infected persons per capita also misleading. early warning system what's important hospitals capacity preventable deaths due overcrowded hospitals. Especially vaccine availability. Germans respect authority, willing put group individual. Dutch culturally fundamentally different (generally).  children get permanent lung damage, cost society even long run. see waste money China like you, would guess may part problem. Two weeks ago, regulations got dropped. okay then.

Now, much anymore. thinking too.  mask stigma US (my biases included) lifted probably carrying one fall/winter regardless what's going on. would anyone wish that?  Source? Logic.

An autumn surge expected. Cases already rising around US. know rise deaths follow. Look Missouri see heading for.

As long significant anti-vax population, it’s going rougher ride needs be. wear full industrial ppe flight? tail end mine well.

Was definitely nice year without this...but now. point. I'm responding person says pushing voluntary mask usage. Vulnerable elderly people are. parents (65/67) got second shot last week. (38) second shot two weeks. 18+ people first shot, many don’t second shot yet. So, half vaccinated would say. shit Sherlock, Dutch government went hero zero rather quick absurd opening Dutch respect authority, rules always considered optional debatable. That's culture. Face cover expected, means almost zero people Thanks (duh) Well, worst case bought infection. Woah idea pregnant women get vaccine earlier. 

Thank answer, made realise easy think is. know hospitals work lockdown, work one. Cancer diagnostic dead. ppl exercise much lockdowns, sąd reality Rest assured new strains every year. way control virus outbreaks amount people planet amount infection vectors. ‘ol exponential switcheroo. Ya need logarithmic scale one *those.*

Fuck Koala Killer crap policies. People **die** incompetance. Probably sooner due today's final. don’t numbers Netherlands first wave UK, average time positive test death 13 days. Usually, also takes days people gets tested 14-17 days infection probably closer correct amount time. Wow, millions risk? idea Israel aged sickly population. Man I'm feeling sorry kids cause knows could happen them. bff works EMT sees children covid organs fried, words mine. kids gonna lasting effects would rather virus largely unknown vaccine taken millions people. understand is, great mostly people getting vaccinated ánd holding bare minimum rules. decide open target/promote least vaccinated groups? drop masks everyone/majority vaccinated? vaccinated still infect others, vaccinated infect infected. people general cannot trusted look health. Even without delta variant, makes sense government went it. Could imagine going work cruise ship also choosing vaccinated ? mental gymnastics Well thinking best individual rather collective. Lockdown harsh af work. vaccinate ppl shut everything down. know already many deaths lockdowns cause. locked 18 months already, thier psychiatrist must working overtime. Btw got first shot 2020 bragging lol That’s part debate Netherlands well. worried long doesn’t translate hospitalizations? think ‘no’ think ‘yes’. latter group worried long covid, happens lot ‘mild cases’ well. also, ‘mild cases’ mild. large grey area sniffles couple days basically lying deathbed covid19. people, including younger people, never hospitalized cannot get bed weeks. personally don’t think that’s ‘mild’.

Also, I’m fully vaccinated yet, I’m pregnant. consider ‘vulnerable’ case given covid19 associated pregnancy- birth complications. government acknowledges, pregnant women don’t get priority here.

So I’m personally conflicted whether something worry not. think increase extreme though. numbers went incredibly fast. wonder groups getting together watch Euro ⚽️ clusters… one would think yes dont want assume. Heard someone coming home vacation Mallorca: ""I feel like shit think corona, tell anyone put extra make-up, otherwise let return""

No shit Sherlock, infected whole airport people plane could come home? turns indeed worked like that. Hundreds thousands people went 'dancing Janssen'. supply fully exhausted time. aren’t shut exercise hospitals aren’t closed. clever Pubs Bars December Ireland could see writing wall. ie. enough intelligence paid enough attention understand NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) reason recommending government face Alpha(UK) Variant could open retail indoor Dining/Pubs both. clever bar owners realised ignoring NPHET advice mistake would explosion cases Indoor Dining would almost immediately closed again. Clever Bar owners never re-opened knew would shortlived, knew employees coming going back onto PUP (Pandemic Unemployment Payment) would PITA employee (in terms tax accounting them), knew stock bought would cost fortune, end needed, end going date inevitable re-lockdown deal breweries cover eventuality.

I understand people think could end Pub industry Ireland example. getting supports government keep afloat. viable government borrow many billions need ECB. Everyone boat Europe. like EU going punish given EU country exceeding normal mandated Budget deficit levels charge us punitive interest rates. hundred year event thats affecting whole Europe nevermind world. ECB World Bank understand everyones national Debt ballooned Billions. new levels new normal. punish country compared another go blow 20 billion new fighter jets reason instead say infrastructure ROI. single country punishment ballooning National Debt every country planet increase expenditure reason. ie hundred year Global Pandemic. Millions. could go country vulnerable people haven’t even started vaccinated yet. Battling employee shortages, supply chains unreliable inflation. Private companies likely this. Also virus wiping people pension retirees, anything helps them(yes evil). 

Capitalism, worries profits.... health. SECOND announced masks mandatory anymore last second saw masks.

It's strong culture 'being normal'. People really want one person going trend. means nobody does, reinforces feeling. think receive good amount October recall correctly. can't make vaccines appear thin air. asked nurse time said there’s guidance say can’t. I’m also microbiologist see reason effectiveness would diminished, might end little tired. actually made difference end. cautious second jab though case. Yeah, mention paying outlandish fees university. especially, ones require lab yeesh feel bad. Glade finished undergrad last 3 years tho covid screw life plans year studying. third paragraph incorrect. equation light weighing effects covid infections. death hospitalization that's 'serious' - plenty effects serious worse using standardized clinical criteria, including morbidity (suffering) 3-5 days, responsible transmitting disease Nan Gramps.

That's source, since many can't bothered google something goes pre-existing beliefs. would also say telling people didn’t need wear masks really matter “science says”. scientific judgement level risk going without masks, there’s also policy decision level risk accepted, considerations like incentivizing vaccination. 

In Canada seem taking cautious approach – masking, general. don’t think that’s we’re reaching different scientific conclusions, culturally tend risk-averse Americans. New South Wales numbers. rest states closed borders them

Most states also faced situations delta. NSW thought decent lockdown effective. Spoilers Anti-Vaxers ignorant fools......and many 60s 70s. Well state sponsored? can't nationwide app states would agree it. many states scream ""no vaccine passport!"" number basically says nothing vaccine own. know outcome could without vaccines. number value comparison. like people starting get annoyed, vote exactly same. Lol Definitely seems people drawn line sand line ""I'm done covid moving life""  net benefit even people die

As harsh sounds always this. Otherwise would full lockdown last case gone. vaccinating 1 million dies.

 get wrong strongly disagree Dutch government handled 100% agree feel like society genuinely doesn’t care people like can’t even take basic precautions even simple information campaigns help teach people make better choices… sounds like opposite even going on. Even fully vaccinated, never worried actually dying Covid-19; knew statistically risk quite low, given age overall health. was, still aim, worried potential long-term impacts new virus. There’s still lot uncertainty there, picture seems become worrisome time.

Many people seem care death rate, dismissive considerations like Long Covid, unjustified confidence vaccinated person needn’t worry Long Covid. They’ve already made mind “Covid over”, won’t accept idea information goes conclusion.

With regard Long Covid, point doesn’t seem much relationship severity initial illness, likelihood developing Long Covid issues, severity issues. Given observation, reassured knowledge breakthrough infections vaccinated usually mild?

Anyways… long-winded way agreeing need answers issue. Except aren't, barely anyone country seems blame decision makers. Dutch damn complacent incredibly frustrating.  deluded Trump? Strewth, that’s big statement. much!!! exactly said, people already observing restrictions announced restrictions lifted, ppl went crazy. 26th street house parties happening every day. Yesterday cycling supermarket mask, someone passing called kanker ... Significantly less air filtration, especially masks get damp moisture exhaled breath.

I don’t think “omg we’re killing children making wear masks!” It’ll probably help least *a little.* I’m convinced masks *the* answer. really effective interventions tend cost money, know money schools. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Looking post see major red flags rules 5, 4, even 1. little risk death, ignore potential risks.

Dr Greg pediatrician I'm going record saying allowing kids freely infected novel disease unknown long term consequences worst idea 2021 despite pretty crowded field far many people Singapore have? supposed national pride smell ignorant? Comparing country 5 million Indonesia, fourth populous country world?  Australia also needs get shit together get citizens vaccinated. kind fools running show under. No, that’s efficacy calculated. need compare unvaccinated control group.  tech researched personalized treatments serious diseases like cancer, mass vaccinations. long term safety trials completed. Vaccinations lower hospitalisations twentieth, yet happens twenty times many people get infected last wave? There's good chance never happen, cases double every two days, today's cases could already outdo previous peaks, today's infections appear tests five days. Besides, majority Netherlands yet fully vaccinated growing number highly susceptible people whose vaccinations happened half year ago.

But indeed, know sure next spring. ADE observed vaccine. Please read rules subreddit, particularly rules 5 4. I'm genuinely sorry mental health took toll everything happened.

I think rest post exaggerated places. People get sick Covid often significant amount time many people long term symptoms complications. Further, bodies piling streets happened despite 600,000 deaths hospitals overflowing, hope saying figurative sense.

It really suck, taking sensible precautions prevent things getting back troubling lock state in. think possible wear mask indoors groups and/or choosing smaller group settings, mindful keeping distance, keeping hands clean, spaces well ventilated.

Of course, could get enough people vaccinated, would unlikely reason things.  know might far fetched, could possibly parents want kids get COVID, period? Maybe death rates factor considered. bullshit science data 50% fully vaccinated.

\- Someone fully vaccinated voted Parsons personally know two people symptoms wont go doctor fear bill. guessing may waay under-reported  Personally, don’t like “Indian” “American Indian” kind term uses word obvious reason opposite end world India. clarify, say don’t like don’t mean offends me, mean don’t like using it. It’s also weird mistake realized relatively quickly didn’t get corrected right away, kind kept calling us Indians lol. said that, it’s primary term used America many years ingrained lot us way ingrained lot non Natives. Many tribal documents still use it, good amount family members use without thinking twice. doesn’t really bother someone refers Indian. 

I don’t think it’s exclusively age thing, know younger folks still say referring themselves. However, use definitely declining, least observed, would agree older generations use younger ones. Obviously can’t speak tribes even tribe since individuals preferences, personal experience map like called. use Native American, personally. “indigenous” encyclopedia word use animals plants, it’s kind funny gaining steam preferred PC word used refer us. personally never heard tribal citizen say “I’m indigenous” lol. like plain old “Native”. dad, uncles, grandpa, great grandpa used “Indian”. think word wind phasing eventually, take while. meantime, don’t think bothers us much people think does. 

Anyways sorry long winded response question haha   This! Also add lots leisure travelers almost business travelers like recipe chaos. 

Before Covid half plane flying work knew routine. We're basically trained get on, stow stuff, sit down, strap shut up.

Leisure flyers rarely fly know routine often ones fuck everyone.

That extra unemployment money spent flying random places instead actually working.... think you’re looking single day report. It’s better use seven day moving average accurate picture. Great question. Almost everyone US dying covid unvaccinated. vaccines work well I'm really point someone want get vaccinated, I'm losing much sleep self inflicted fate. course extremely small subset people can't get vaccinated, probably always take extra precautions, bad news story hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated increase. rule disallowing unvaccinated athletes? allergens Moderna, look up.


Moderna: polyethylene glycol (PEG) tromethamine (trometamol Tris) could sack government. wait, already 4 months ago. fact die car accident anytime life. 25 unvaccinated odds ever dying Covid extremely low probably going highest period March 2020 March 2021. dumb, logical. 

Most countries enough vaccines even vulnerable, definitely young healthy people like Olympic Athletes.

Japan capacity vaccinate everyone coming Olympics either.

Making vaccination requirement would put many nations untenable position either letting Olympians jump front queue sending delegation all.

Obviously, issue US though, agree required American athletes. Politically probably fly though. think one problem might be, least perspective, lot public kind trained think vaccines equal long term protection. think medical community, government, drug companies, etc purposefully use term ""vaccine"" flu shot. simply call flu shot.

So covid shot labeled ""vaccine"" puts thoughts long term protection people's minds, whether may talks boosters. people already hearing needing third shot got first 2 rounds months ago.

Also, nobody calls yearly flu shot booster. Again, call flu shot.

Bottom line, may hard convince people get booster vaccine that, minds, give long term protection.  I've got two antivax friends ivermectin train. looks like benefit, good news. However, definite concerns limitations around results think mandate study anyone say ""yea"" ""nay"".

First all, ""study"" meta-analysis multiple lower-quality studies - limited data, low cell count, double-blinded, etc. Nothing peer-reviewed. study affiliated BIRD Group (British Ivermectin Recommendation Development Group), clearly unbiased organization, researchers disclosed fact study - huge red flag me. Lastly, there's mention whether people taking different drugs also taking steroids not, shown clear benefit.

So said one I'd like see proper study done actually using gold standard methodology I'd enjoy reviewing outcomes (and hope show good results) got accused difficult purposely trying piss off. 

Mind you, person extremely busily reading every ingredient US approved vaccines also challenging results safety saying ""the vaccines killing tens thousands people"" huge amount skepticism general danger vaccines bring. Yet he's ready put drug system without knowing works. course, ready start taking hydroxychloroquine soon Dr. Donald J. Trump, MD, PhD, got bandwagon.

FOR FUCKS SAKE - want fucking pandemic much anyone. give single flying fuck pandemic ended weed, chocolate, benadryl, popcorn **or** ivermectin. there's cheap, safe effective treatment prevents COVID, let's us it. However, going inject random shit body without good science behind it. ADDITIONALLY, would want know drug would actually provide similar protection infection, hospitalization death vaccine, less could know protected I'd be.  ivermectin good vaccine preventing hospitalization/death? right timeframe take it? take higher dosage given parasitic infections, side effects there? effective base type COVID variants? 

It's amazing people accept drugs face value limited poorly-done research, accept vaccines given billions people worldwide.

Like said, hope fucking works - let's sure conducting real, double blinded, peer-reviewed study sufficient scale make statistically valid conclusion.

SMFH. Netherlands thought occurred me. else would government open everything everyone already knew would end tears? know statistics UK US 1 103 chance dying Auto Accident life. odds dying falling ladder think similar. OD 1 97. 2,424 people 18 29 died COVID US since January 2020. time period 2,623 age group died Pneumonia related covid. 2019 around 13,000 age group died Opioid overdoses. evanc3 I'm knowledgeable authorization process vaccines/drugs FDA, I'm still confused this. 

You say Pfizer strongly implied rollout booster shot decision make. get assuming need third shot they're literally asking gov't need third shot. Even U.S. said thanks, want authorize, plenty countries may interested (EU, UK, etc) Pfizer could apply there. U.S. still approved AstraZeneca, they've still sold lots doses places, like would unprecedented.

I guess PR perspective, could handled better, alternative, FDA Pfizer put statement together? problematic issues seem closely tied, people think gov't going end rubber stamping product private pharma company due diligence? significant number gotten vaccine still concerned EUA quickly approved. FDA Pfizer everything behind closed doors announce things publicly together smoothed over, people going suspicious there's real back forth FDA approves whatever Pfizer does? 

Pfizer developed candidate third vaccine dose. need approval U.S. event start trials, last months themselves, including analyzing data, mass production doses, etc. 

One option would wait FDA/CDC officially agree need third shot ""clear public messaging,"" we'd need wait months shots got arms. 

Another option avoid issue announcing need doses avoid muddying waters could secretly asked approval start trial, months later FDA Pfizer released joint statement, well, trials completed third dose coming now, needed. lacking lot transparency terms trials started approved? public company even allowed? 

I see either options good, still see issues joint statement, seems like FDA going rubber stamp anything Pfizer does. lack transparency process we're seeing end stages everything already agreed upon already. 

Honestly, seems like completely ludicrous situation Pfizer need ask permission FDA, also need make sure ask permission even ask permission. Pfizer made statement they're going ask permission start trial third dose, they've made. FDA said, we'll look it, right need third dose. outsider, see completely reasonable situation. I'd actually suspicious seemed like everything prearranged ahead time show front public.  shambles changing messages reactive leadership? 

Yes shambles type. Missouri getting big surge covid hospitalizations now. People aren’t getting vaccinated. least one county mentioned 40% vaccinated population. 

Now it’s younger people quite serious they’re hospitalized. parents trash kids vaccinated. Vaccinated - fuck it. Tired bullshit. Literally want live possibly getting sick die. Fuck it. I've read seen, vaccinated people get infected even transmit infection.

Yes, rate much lower non-vaccinated.

I'm sick parents whining tough lot life. largely necessary people covid infectious becoming symptomatic. That's common recall. end, let 2% die scenario... Sadly, that's Wishing get sick? None deserves catch Covid, no-one. 25 statistically higher chance dying struck lightning COVID. chances dying car accident, overdose, poison falling ladder 100s times likely. makes bit sense look US one country, 50 allied republics.

It's obviously complicated that, conceptually far off.  PepeSilvia.gif possible reason due Euro Cup matches, ppl watching games bars clubs? Literally everything open California right now. masks optional vaccinated. That's awful. sorry loss. long getting AZ shot uncle become ill? usually takes number weeks reach full protection, especially one shot vaccines. 35th country cases deaths. 

Guess could've much worse. thoughtful kind zealot. wife physician fully vaccinated now, waited couple months get vaccinated little data side effects people Type-1 diabetes (yes, Type-1). read numerous papers subject, actual papers, journalist's interpretation papers, finally reached conclusion.

And think allowed practice medicine? I'm glad power enforce might get violent did. I'm fan zealots either side political spectrum. Vaccination, contact tracing quarantine, pandemic first started.

There countries done part stamp virus within borders, dragged countries put effort control it. 25 unvaccinated statistically higher chance dying car accident.We've learned much virus hear antibodies like they're component immune system. Memory B cell immunity lasts years.I wish people would sober facts demanding implement kind sick vaccine passport system really leaves door wide open society looks like East Germany. Papers, please!

Well even 65 greater chance dying car accident underlying condition. get Australia? claim 1/3 infected people get Long Covid obviously wrong. Got second shot Moderna yesterday feel... fine? 24 hours later, sore arm much less first shot. Slight fever around 99F took paracetamol for. noticeable thing tiredness last night resulted getting best sleep I've weeks, welcome. 

I prepared completely knocked still looking side effects, fingers crossed go away smoothly. 20 people sue consciously put other's passengers life danger. less risky driving car going end restrictions. People die car accidents every day life time disabilities cases. one saying ban driving. Vaccines risk dying low enough disabilities low enough point keeping restrictions on.  you’re seriously underestimating delta strain Based daily case counts published (I get data Google dashboard, sources NYT), 35,201 new cases reported Friday.  Texas Florida seem like they're actively trying kill populace. same, information exists trust it. 

You can't say ""Well work"" people go it.  work fast food joint asked us present proof Vaccination order wear mask. 2 25 did, several said would never getting it.

The ""stupid"" among ""us""? mean Nobel winning virologists, head CDC, Fauci called emergency secret meeting elite group international scientists thought looked like engineered?

No wait, 15 minutes figured out.

This self righteous, condescending ridiculous post I've read day.

Please keep room temperature IQ analysis situation future. mistake. believe effective biologicals antiviral treatments Spanish flu. mean anti-maskers, antivaxxers. kids homeschooled, wear masks, dont go anywhere lol sick free since Dec 19 hehe Alberta, don’t even get one issued you’re fully vaxxed.  specific COVID. lot problem-solving fields use metaphor. point would everybody nobody. Schools able enforce mask mandates unvaccinated students. Assuming states decent vaccinate rate children teens, see point keeping mask mandate. Might even best group high schoolers elementary schoolers since age group *can* vaccinated right now. Yeaaaa theres literally 2000 types cold almost impossible vaccinate it. Maybe someday they'll able make something universal dunno.... We’re never going hit 70-80 percent fully vaccinated especially without children vaccinated. take years point. going indefinitely social distance mask years come? Vaccine rates fall cliff higher go contingent mot want get vaccinated. Maybe imagine would challenged probably successfully. Insurance providers can't descriminate stupidity. It’s much higher depending get tested. False negative rate extremely high you’re day exposure. Fauci says..... think they're saying Fiji nothing going atm, rather two connected. answers correct. addition way people got tested. order go bars night clubs needed free speed test one government assigned locations. 

A lot symptomatic youth got tested. Good news barely new hospitals admissions. Wasn’t story news saying MRNA vaccines could last years?? NGL news like really bums One under-appreciated risk Delta transmissible lockdown measures fail reduce R 1. (And shitposters Reddit saying that, concern epidemiologists too: early say that's what's happening here, expect Sydney outbreak brought control in-depth contact tracing Australians do. there's certainly risk number infections per day exceeds capacity contact tracers effect contact tracing falls cliff. Sept.?  pushing thinking safe parents stopped feel really guilty :(. safe I’m fully vaccinated everyone family except brother first shot 8 days start??? 16 context Good. states reinstate mask mandate everyone.

""Following science"" imply tearing masks. recommendation made Delta variant became dominant studies showed vaccines much less effective it.

Masks work, cost wearing mask low. Approx 80% adults first shot 40% fully vaccinated. numbers increasing daily. people know 1st shot 2nd scheduled next weeks.

Seems like UK breakthrough infections leading higher hospitalization rates.

I saying nothing, would waited longer last steps took 26th, hospitalization.is flat 2-3 weeks I'll thinking might alright. There’s stronger argument mask mandates important in-person learning is. you’re comfortable maskless restaurants concerts, choose avoid situations easily. given know remote learning falling short, parents hard time choosing send kids school, I’m sympathetic policy makes choice easier. doesn’t translate hospitalization, cares? sure it’s Delta? heard sorts symptoms vaxxed… better CDC test vaccinated people? way vaccine stay 100% effective everyone. spent lot money needs work.... They're called chin diapers reason. entered Panera Oregon today person wearing mask. really mind wearing mask I'm public. I'll remove around people know vaccinated. 

I'm concerned Delta variant, plus, spend time 2.5 year toddler.

I'm fine erring side caution bit longer. “CASES” Sorry I’m altering life anymore people home couple days sick let know bodies piling street I’ll consider ruining life becoming nearnsuicidal also used listen podcast 1.75x speed though haha. helped understand much better explaining covid general, used take notes repeat people know calls. stopped listening 2 months moral bit also long covid, difficult find energy, amazing, fact ask questions big plus free. mean, love good airport bar much anyone, it’s responsibility flight crew turn fasten seatbelt sign there’s turbulence dude spent 5 hours getting shitfaced flight. 

And needed say really go/couldn’t hold it, whatever…without details lead ruining everyone. Yeah, I'm sure government loves people cover face public law banning unnecessary face coverings public passed.  Tulip fever? point need stop reporting things like this. Ok. wrong. Homeschool gets bad rep either state properly equipped right criteria materials parents extremists/fundamentalists either think better want control kids. 

My public schooling horrible, grades 6, 8 9 ended homeschooling despite trying go public. Social skills were/are still intact. Extend ""adults ages"" answer yes  admitting wrongdoing standard Rutte doctrine. always someone else's fault. Indeed, Zero Covid people always minority, absolute popularity scientific consensus.

Level headed scientists, like Patrick Vallance (Chief Scientific Advisor UK government) always said Covid become endemic. He's saying public government press conferences regular basis March 2020 onwards.

It's triumph of... I'm quite sure actually... triumph hive mind social media people claim Science demands permanent invasive suppression strategy. That's rational approach tackle endemic virus danger serious outcomes reduced 95% (or more) vaccination.  airline ask negative test decline them.
But dont care want money. Sure, play outside wear masks 70 unvaccinated kids building time poor ventilation masks. Well, idiots actually like idea.  really expect kids 12 social distance? That’s like torture them. stage life need play.  way schools able enforce  kids now. 1 many people died since particular many people died due nightclubs? acid reflux really rare burn minute two me. vaccine like 20 mins I'm kinda worried right now.

Wat een gaaf land! nice weather California, wonder could spend time learning outside. mean id rather wear mask case instead ending dead. Thats tho. Im coronavirus expert like stay home moms saw 1 article 2 days covid first hit based whole beliefs it.   add one reasons cautious Ireland health service completely utterly fucked. cant cope things normal circumstances let alone pandemic. holding us smart guys nice really things option. government say what?  Maybe ask them.  anywhere country still wearing masks? I’m done caring. I’m covid denier, I’m anti masker, I’m fully vaccinated top already covid. don’t fucking care anymore. Either it’s compassion fatigue I’m asshole both. don’t fucking care locked anymore. Cases come first. Death later. New York second worst death rates country New Jersey worse. probably undercounted well. would put NY Governor Florida governor. 2000 cases per day overall? absolutely going pass 2000 overall cases follows past trends/current predictions

Canadian looking south boarder don’t take seriously decent restrictions Hawaii. guy wants president. agree you, actually fireworks 90%. would go back wearing masks?  still remember finding mom helping organization bring indoor plumbing people. ""Wait. Wait. talking US???""

Appalchia 90s.   thriving black market fake vaccination certificates, qr codes medical exemptions.

Having traveled recently places popular Russian tourists, surprise all. absolutely refused wear masks, bragged online fake vaccine cards got allowed avoid quarantine, even regularly denounced COVID ""fake"" Americans.  wonder overdoses relation stimulus checks. Give addict $1200 might buy normal? example, partygoers screenshotted QR codes sent friends didn’t test

Everyone involved imprisoned year. Seriously. People literally die time screwing around wagging fingers long over. countries fucked different degrees. think compared many others, German measures bad all. biggest German fuck slow start vaccination campaign. betting man I’d bet this. public health messaging disease botched start. people aren’t going back regardless waves. I’m afraid dependent vaccination reprieve now. causing arrhythmia asymptomatic, that's symptom. symptoms, typical chest discomfort/dyspnea anything else points sort inflammation, would point benign arrhythmia. wildly common pretty much evey person planet irregular heart rhythm time time 1. population conducting clinical trials on: Pfizer clinical trial gives 93% efficacy conducted general US population. Brazil, SINOVAC study gave vaccine 50% efficacy done frontline health workers. Age, population density, everything completely different.
2. stage spread infection population: Pfizer study done much earlier infection curve done Brazil, level exposure completely different.
3. Presence comorbidities different populations.
4. study group SINOVAC trial Brazil mostly exposed Manaus variant, Pfizer study group mostly exposed tot alpha variant. 

Comparing two different vaccines completely independent clinical trials scientifically meaningless. Yeah right they'll keep reporting it. Covid big deal still Live country unfortunately, testing facilities bad even peak, shut now. 

Local rep Tory, going anything it. in, reporting journal shit. Right? 😂😂😂  Sorry! mainly memorised vaccine developed Leiden, memorise well company Dutch. followed Canadian strategy, bought *all* vaccines. Yeah see lot comments like we're doomed something, indeed people infected moment 30 likely require hospitalization. spread elderly since already vaccinated. really problem? point live it. Wow. That's way specific. one, awesome, wish luck finding it!

Yeah that's thought...

Really, want know vaccinated diabetics fare compared unvaccinated diabetics. hard find data this. seems English version This. Loki correct first Avengers movie. “Freedom” biggest lie ever created society. Follow money Freedom = Free dumb.  Asymptomatic myocarditis quite common; estimated asymptomatic often symptomatic. headline, photo person ""receiving"" dose, tested animals extremely misleading. sure I'd feel either side patient one administering vaccine 🤔 Walmart partnered clear app vaccination proof phone. I’ve baseball games recently large packed concert never asked vaccination mask requirements. got positivity rate whole state California went back normal see everyone blaming bad policies, certainly true, one mentions fact testing also went massively youth ACA disallows insurers charging vaccination status. fucked thing: “work/learn” 1y study. contract ended failed missed many lessons.

So soon certificate pay contract ends month.

Infuriating hell alarming jump yes, important see hospitalisations follow stay low. stay low big problem.  left Croatia. Glad problem people would risk end though vaccinated point. 

I’ve covid, I’ve still gotten fully vaccinated. I’m worrying folks ✌️. American living Netherlands definitely tell entire pandemic, see Dutch “Americans Europe”, negative way.

However, anecdotally, tell based recent trip US, plenty Americans still wear masks stores, even don’t to.  second one me. You’re gaslighting reason want tell people it’s medical condition/deny well may reality want diagnose anxiety. It’s job figure them! Let doctor figure out, can’t diagnose either. Telling don’t think based Reddit post place! hard understand. 

It’s damaging assume someone’s experience. People like another subreddit told symptoms anxiety made doubt never went hospital things clearly wrong. doctor. cannot diagnose. Since kids risk? people barely notice anything. first shot easy, second shot bedridden day Haha raves envious people at.... idiots 😅 Again, trialled **mass** vaccinations, studies look long term effects might have. first study linked look 101 people, that's old methods use lipid microparticles ([""could reduced mRNA encapsulated lipid 5 studies read forum, mentioned safety meaningful capacity. briefly raised point risk excessive inflammation result LNP. 

My point still stands, valid concerns safety mRNA mass vaccination procedure, especially among young healthy, COVID much risk. Whats vaccination rate like there? simply true. Vaccination appointments Netherlands staggered age sub-30s able get first shot last two weeks. OMGGG……anyways Oh c'mon bad, yes lot cases unlikely lead many hospitalizations really get point. Sure, statistically probably hospitalized vaxxed not, vaccine lowers chance even further. I'm saying would've hospitalized without it, ""worked"" sense worry hospitalization all. That's really drawing conclusion I've never called anyone dumb. Also completely scrapped masks, barely worn first place, everyone took off. Even Chicago weeks ago indoor mandate plenty stores requiring anyway even stores it’s mandatory, plenty people still wear them.

Tldr: can’t trust Dutch people  you’re vaccinated cares? I’m vaccinated idiots idiots wouldn’t prevent flying.

A lot people care know vaccine efficacy 100%, means unlikely, still catch virus even though vaccinated.

You care never know affect you, either directly indirectly. could get sick yourself, would clearly affect life negatively. Even care that, still impact negatively.

Maybe one infected gives zero shit people get airplane end infecting lot people, infect others unbeknownst themselves, way people care about. Whether weeks, months years flight - could affect you.

Even one infected person end damage right conditions, stuck close quarters dozens hundreds people definitely right conditions diseases prosper. definitely care people purposely use public transport contagious - regardless we're vaccinated not.  Yeah people know living abroad flown back US get vaccine. never really thought US embassy distributing vaccines citizens abroad.  I'm sorry, that's horrible... Lowest risk themselves.  infect? quantity infections causing mutations?  

Look chicken pox.  kid catches spreads fast.  kids fine. hits adult without protection, could die. chicken pox vaccine, parent yet,they'd separated rest family,to make sure catch it. 

This different.  kid catches covid,and spreads every kid found out. family members zero protection they're anti vax, importantly medically can't, likely catch it. basically taking everything that's done last year half stop it,and throwing garbage.  

Id feel bad kids gave parent, parent died.  kid wears mask problem, he's 4.  He'll, he's worn outside playing neighbors kid wanted to, too.  There's feeling bad wearing mask. That's projecting. regarding socializing distancing, I've seen playgrounds recess. They're socializing fine.  677k total like one shipment tho, actually big deal compared general population, even count ""diverting vaccines"". Except elderly highest vaccination rate. absolute numbers, there's slight bump age groups, percentage hospitalizations 65 group fallen accounting 40 50% hospitalizations around 30%. 18 49 year olds, less vaccinated group, that's accounting largest percentage   Nice hear, hopefully join 80%+ group soon. 

For weeks seeing people refer UK Israel ""highly vaccinated"" thinking surely cannot consider ""highly vaccinated"". Yeah, expecting disappear 100%, nothing else typical list vaccines 100% disappeared, hoping would extremely rare. think hope point, humanity decided time great new age semi-vax society. That's key. one ever did. Cocid death family. response? ""I'm sorry"" anything like that. ""eh old"". 

When teach see masks hear stories friends teaching masks kids...I know. Hell friends go masks vaccines. know lying Florida. I'd love proved wrong. Yeah it’s fucked up, meanwhile wife worked elderly home lungcovid second time got covid home 4 months still barely condition/energy oh fuck thats exactly Austria doing.  Finally can't imagine hitting clubs state lol. surprised...... U/icouldntdecide person convinced them. going about? Without strong leadership like Governor Newsom 

Lol Nope, Hague area. Everyone around similar schedule. edited all. country advanced dumbest living among other. US scale one confidently equally magnify voice everyone hear. Right it’s masking restrictions many people somewhere/go what, many personal spent last year provincial borders shut everyone except essential travellers, openings connected provinces cases low enough. think need stop gaslighting people Reddit. don’t need new doc, symptoms mostly resolved time talked didn’t subject insane amount money I’d pay tests insurance wouldn’t cover entirely. I’m grateful doctor believes me. God knows I’ve encountered doctors gaslight like you. Something wrong get caught need weasel

I bored integrity, sacrifice, consideration

/s already lagging. 

These countries 1 million inhabitants highest uptake. US 4th early May 24th. surprised end summer 1918. No. nasal spray. case, well known Sinovac effective

I keep hearing comparative study done SINOVAC different vaccine?

All seen far comparing efficacy rates independently conducted clinical trials vaccine, meaningless, since conditions trial drastically different.  60% unvaxxed good. 

Not country wide access vaccines. fuck nightclub setting ""controlled""?

The parties never stopped similar ads US. seems combination national campaigns professional presentation rather cheesy ones put together local level. They're common TV, YouTube, radio am. Pfizer doses used Israel made Belgium iirc Politicians understand, care short term political presents give awa populace. Especially current Dutch pm de Jonge cda need form new coalition weak political place. Recovery like 1-2 days even side effects.  far. actively sick. gave 5 years pension move back New England Ft Myers. extra money opportunities made loss. occasionally miss Florida weather it’s easy enough jump plane days. Exactly, remember polio iron lungs? want kids Florida least 46% fully vaccinated. Stop lying. good proof vaccination still contact spread disease vaccinated? foolish idea. mean ""us West"" EU exporting 50% vaccines made there, vaccinations going well EU, countries donate doses used

Only US UK basically prevented export vaccines


This white guilt shit go virtual.  debating it.  Like lump it. predictable response. 

I criticized announcement timing, Delta horizon, don’t think people understood saying relieved idea going back “normal”. One closest friends fucking paramedic unvaccinated. offered shot December. He's people's faces, trying ""save life"" times. said he's ""not sure long term effects"". wear mask anymore ""because anywhere anymore!"". gently remind guidelines established vaccinated people, anyone cares.

He often tells he'd give life someone else save without second thought. really understand kind mental gymnastics required either are. Unfortunately countries solved homeless. Potentially Finland way, it’s yet. also you. don’t protect people around variant spreads mutates could infect would you. People don’t give fuck others won’t care protects others. True story  talking due vaccination rate. They're 10% population. delay giving population vaccines give medics third shot risk 2 shots. hog drew guns protesters got invited RNC running Senate too? I'm North Carolina hardly talk shit man. Haha. fucks scared everything… 2 million Americans dead would acceptable losses then. ""Covid liked that""  good experience spent time him. fine.

More around 93-96% effective preventing hospitalisation I've seen stats multiple studies. I've yet see single study preventing Long Covid following mild infection. source that, let know.  going home, seeing whole extended family Sunday.. go back work, school, daycare Monday.. Spanish flu didn’t vaccine ready within year can't wait see anti-vaccers going come new vaccine. 

Here's guess: "" government trying kill us nasal vaccine injecting cancer brain!""

What's best guess? thing 'crush' Covid getting country vaccinated. can't lockdown way problem. study Sinovac vs Delta yet majority countries used contact Delta en masse yet. one ""study"" probably thinking (published there) Facebook post questionable data consisting 10 samples total. Well health professionals ever said it, least. problem US people “tired” pandemic may never done anything help end it, including getting vaccinated. enforced loss job. work music venue, several testing entry gigs far.

At every gig 2 security guys 2 people controlling test results, group 50-60 people. people stand line 10 minutes properly checking.

I really wouldn’t surprised nightclubs put one person checking tests told never leave people waiting longer 5 minutes. year half still get part infectious diseases infected people infect people. mean, rattling around head yours, think disease spreads?

Adults infect children infect children adults. proof covid ever dangerous children? proof mean peer reviewed science, news articles. would worried I'd somehow screw using nasal spray something important. stick needle sit there. NH restrictions lifted. Even though I’m vaccinated, still wear (double) mask everywhere go, time I’m one wearing one. knuckle-dragging rednecks around vaccinated, delta variant isn’t lurking around lumps flesh gyrating around public. It’s astounding people quickly throw caution wind. cousin went Miami get Johnson vacinee worried variants. go back Miami Pfizer one months? allowed? country dont wanna give booster shot Johnson. People Johnson really get booster even vacinee effective. Two doses better right?  sub linked full antivaxers claim bad side effects vaccine never got. Every person family vaccinated except sister. always wants talk horrible side effects hilarious. 

It’s also borderline stupid. mRNA spike protein undetectable 5 days. Yet antivax pieces crap like spread lies side effects. 

If choose get vaccinated, fine. Stop trying spread bullshit prevent others so. big mistake CDC changing guidance feds still paying covid care.

If states pay hospital patients state tax dollars they’d care. they’ll blame Biden Democrats excessive spending, cutting state taxes. know that, general, masks work. RCT assigning students unmasked group would unethical. Why? still use mask 28 days, least? remember post months ago employee, maybe Whole Foods? asking better ventilation store. Commenters said demand upper management, did. Made big stink too. person lost job.

Imo, going local government get ventilation improved everyone better avenue. work out, least risk going fucking homeless. take second AZ 6 weeks first dose wait 8-12 weeks first dose? Considering Delta variant spreading, taking second dose slightly late provide better immunity?  cancel it. subjects important. aren’t ready return 100% normal life. ...What? Science support opposing views. Yup exactly, lot people sudden became virologists night know people working pandemic since day one. Well live LA advertisements resources everywhere English Spanish. lack trying. 118 people hospital covid. average 8 more
taken in. IC: 88 people 2 per day taken in. lowest year NL.

Source: said understand we're freaking number cases anymore. People ain't dying fast right size fit wallet. Baffling.  entire point getting vaccinated could live normal lives. doesn’t mean “done caring.” really, think longest intervals shots 4 weeks. main downside single shot efficacy low, therefore absolutely need doses get good protection. Sorry, his/her fault letting go safety rules soon getting vaccinated.

Being day 6 covid symptoms 17 janssen vaccination means he/she wait 2 -3 weeks needed. there's guarantee get vaccine want next appointment system gives you.

Yeah, this. much this. Right we're wave healthcare system strained everyone wants *some* form vaccine, we're position pass wait around next turn...whenever comes along.

This Sinovac right us right now. hope booster plans become available soon. You’re right, it’s US. combine “mandates” “vaccines” mandate vaccine? COVID would over. Euros They’ve proven pretty effective hospital staff pandemic. Many eventually tested positive exposed small amounts let’s body build natural immunity odds serious illness drop seems.

Mask + vaccine pretty failsafe based data. Western Australian here.
Our federal government literally done fucking -nothing- outside salary relief ended sept/Nov last year.

Thankfully state premier fucking legend.

At first sign hotel quarantine (returning aussies must quarantine 2 weeks hotel, without positive case. Sometimes positive cases shared security, etc) failed, lockdown 3-4 days, wait zeros. Crack masks another week, go back 100% normal.

Melbourne one point 170 new cases day. 112 day lockdown zero.
If act fast decisively, control this, evidently.

Every time community transmission case pops say “this one gets hand...” 
but far, good.

Makes really sad think. lost lives politicians didn’t guts ability explain constituents ramifications non-action.@ learn last year “Corona Cruise Ships”? Apparently nothing … See ""variants"" link huge comment below, end comment. Anyone know willfully ignorant Maybe over, Republicans enough voters left win another election. One hope. Politics = government 

Are suggesting would happened gov recommendations cdc lock downs/restrictions government? Probably worse death perspective. Bill Gates putting chips vaccines **confirmed**?

“We don’t really that.” - way many journalists right I'm sorry hear might gotten infected, reading comments went 'dansen met janssen' instead waiting fully covered vaccine.

Get well soon hopefully you’ll recover without long covid symptoms wish political sides would follow science. CDC right money since day 1 see reason ignore recommendations personally feel comfortable. lot armchair science going days. never given understaffed nightclubs bars responsibility check tests. wouldn’t taken time correctly check results probably boss would said let people doubt, cause “they already hardtime due lockdown could use every possible sale”.

And saying weeks ago, despite working event venue. Influenza virus subtype H1N1 never goes away recent global pandemic 2009. broadly speaking still around. want? vaccine, half population counting it, well year masks lockdowns. There’s really much ask for.

Do want cure every possible disease stop wearing masks? that’s dumb. Need driver's licence drive Janssen Johnson Dutch.  serious person. Don’t expect people treat differently. Open up! Time get lives mean less hesitant older people Portugal less hesitant young people elsewhere?

In case think need wait see. People sometimes say one thing another. polls willingness vaccinate conducted months ago countries shown accurate. Ultrapotent antibodies diverse highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants

In normal English:

Scientists identify natural SARS-CoV-2 super immunity 23 10.1126/science.abh1766 gonna small number compared happen UK 10 days now. According CDC report, kicked first place lab contacting state say “hey we’ve 21 positive cases Delta small locale, maybe go check out” state went investigating found connected one gym, presumably started interviewing take tally vaccinated/non, also linking additional gym cases weren’t sequenced presumed Delta due epidemiological info, bringing 47. presume symptomatic cases even tested, well officials got involved start analyzing cluster. still understand many European countries opened without vaccines place. Like, duh..... course happen. Deborah Fuller Amesh Adalja cannot convince compare efficacy rates different vaccines different clinical trials, certainly task. 

Carry on. woods. pandemic over. Hmmm. Utah year ago. infection spikes, calamity. Kids got normal year school. Sports activities too. feel bad kids states politicians chicken right thing. Yeah, they're minimal actualy make difference compared handwashing social distancing.

July 26th looks likely. government industry wanted antigen testing, possible set short timeframe. Public health amalgamation different successful prevention measures little doubt phrase taken work Ah, see, misread news Thank USA everyone donating. dad got Pfizer one. thought would take long time vacinees arrive developing world country Colombia. Im incredibly grateful this. pandemic takin still measures im relieved doses already. need vacinees everyone worldwide. kids don’t care. wear car even. make sure thing contained there's good chance mutate something far dangerous evade vaccines, get enough cases certainty will.

Although maybe new RNA technology quickly whip new vaccine future mutations, read something Biontech making mrna vaccine number weeks, rest time testing such. Agreed.

Know people live remote lives decided get 1 shot go back living relative isolation think get smashing drunk go drive around city. all, think that's best. And, said, nobody control others, okay, right? Except clearly harmless getting vaccinated it? That's keeping yourself, that's vector ongoing pandemic putting others risk. started, former virus researcher, assumed everyone would listen experts political issue. Early on, learned keep quiet because, political/influential voices persuasive would clobber me. disappointing, guess reflective society. expect happen high enough percent population vaccinated. example vaccinated 100% population leftover breakthrough cases. Israel one highest vaccination rates world. possible yes vaccinated people lower viral load making less transmissible infectious shorter period time. Plus bonuses like 95% chance get severe covid 99% chance hospitalized infected. R0 value Delta then?   uhhh, arrhythmias asymptomatic too.

Authorities chicken shit push it, really doubt many companies would risk lawsuits since case.  I’m sorry no. teacher, way I’m split classes again. it’s extra stuff (teachers extra stuff time) reduces learning everyone both. mask come like everyone else. 

And honestly, don’t want hold child accountable opinions parents made instilled within them. Everyone around sucks tho news water wet stop calling bullshit. would seem rules around call anything like bullshit.  teacher personally find negative affects. voice definitely muffled, lost often trying heard. But, prevents long term health consequences kids okay it. fact, students felt secure wearing masks joked exposed we’ll stop wearing them. teach 5th grade reference. would say biggest issue parents buying masks fit kids washing kids masks regularly. disagree people writing off, think people finding solutions. made clear masks deaf children lip read, tons learning programs teachers record audio accompany lesson. saying cumbersome, mask “problems” solvable problems. Every vaccine breakthrough cases, even Pfizer/Moderna. reporting based published effectiveness, Sinovac allow breakthrough cases comparing Pfizer Moderna. die-hard fan restrictions lockdowns since people vaccinated, not?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Quick question.

I'm tour guide almost 2 years FINALLY got back job. Got 1st Pfizer shot yesterday country they've vaccinating age.

My tourists US fully vaccinated since January. ride car 7+1 pax, they're 4 sit front driver. still get chance vaccinated too. drive closed windows full AC talk other.

Our tourists argumented since they're vaccinated need wear masks close us transmit covid. Many tourists around streets ignore rule country states ""you'll pay fine 500€ wear mask"". also argue one follows rules gets fined worry.

After spending around 6 hours car I'm bit apprehensive tbh. 1 even coughed occasionally. know argue save arse getting fired...

Should worry?  don’t think it’s complicated. want circulating antibodies avoid getting COVID-19 all, you’ll probably want annual booster. you’re fine catching COVID-19, potentially fever, chills, etc. days, letting B cells cell work keeping hospital, you’ll probably fine initial vaccination occasional re-exposure virus time.

I don’t really understand pushback Pfizer thinking boosters. It’s better tools available need arise. elderly people high-exposure settings (e.g. older doctors nurses) would perfectly justified wanting booster next winter. Actually explanation first guess. fully gladly enthusiastically vaccinated. Drove 160 miles round trip twice so. 

My second Pfizer dose knocked ass two days. certainly understand someone happen first dose maybe miss couple days work reluctant again. 

What percent folks states skipping second dose, completeness?  Betadine, Vicks. I've using since study came out, sounds like stuff actively kills viruses, would awesome (iota carageenan prevents replicating). 


You also get iodine benzalkonium chloride nasal swab stuff. think iodine nasal swab shown results, benzalkonium chloride (in general) getting mixed results COVID. Fuck Corona. got terrible flavor even get drunk. I'm surprised making many people sick. ""but evil Tony founded creation Covid Gina..."" would eradicate death covid covid. Vaccination effective way reduce R value without destroying economy. ounce prevention worth pound cure. CDC FDA agrees line thinking. Based data far there's evidence widespread rollout booster shots necessary point. course numbers could change months may make recommendation point. efficacy may still hold year now. Yeah, last couple years, especially last one, really helped identify get away no-longer-so-secretly toxic people. tragic thing even small numbers avoidable deaths, vaccinated people still dying due selfishness others refuse get vacinnated. sue person delaying flight? China 2 billion sample size? Ivermectin would completely wipe government wouldn’t make trillions it. Absolutely. Got vaccine back April tested positive I’m assuming Delta variant 3 days ago Normally viruses mutate less lethal.

I information supports idea. 

What stated simple observation death immediate. upsurge 23,000 cases one week, see 23,000 deaths week. People die immediately disease.  

If surge continues 23,000 cases next week still see 23,000 deaths 46,000 deaths could right hoping best.

I made statements related hope. Sinopharm different explain greater efficacy? different adjuvant? higher dose somehow different inactivated mechanic?

The trials vaccines show different results, seemingly consistent way. we've got real-world data (worse trial data, unless trials bad probably were) that's also 50%/80% range. TIL entire world America see lot. One minute screaming people they're downplaying current danger, next saying stuff like this. I'm starting think might trolling. district virtual elementary kids got dedicated classes/teachers, middle &amp; high school kids split. sucked kids &amp; teachers. way really variety classes older kids take.

I like “all elementary kids mask” least age group gets access vaccine. I’m going devastated rates surge fall &amp; youngest can’t go back school person. Great explanation waiting big rainstorm restaurant use bathroom. put mask go inside found alien dozens people dining, walking around, servers without masks.

My friends vaccinated say cities vaccination rate high, like 60% better, rural areas lag tragically behind. could get N95. protects people's nasty. never me. get covid fine; i’m young healthy. It’s protect older weaker immune systems. Immunity binary. could cells B cells last 10 years, doesn’t mean perfect protection disease variants next 10 years.  state-level numbers good look county-level numbers. counties area 15% fully   local thing.

Almost hospitalized people unvaccinated. surge yet larger fall state-wide numbers STL area numbers, seems rising faster. Springfield, looks like daily case numbers match numbers September October, Dec/Jan numbers. Looking hospitalization dashboard SW region (including Springfield, Branson Joplin) hospital census similar early November. ICU census matches max entire span covid. Greene County, containing Springfield, 34% total population vaccinated, nearby counties lower that, bottoming around 15%. matters whether vaccinated people getting infected real world, article about.

""there growing correlation got vaccinated early — mostly January — recently infected."" Good point. mean would pretty fucking cool. think Sinopharm quite bit better Sinovac though, would call one worst. assigned offices cubicles: want office next Wednesday, reserve it. 

Ignoring everything covid-related, alone would make quit job. mistreating everyone equally like communist marxist do- enough enough junk science  make zero sense. part woods, mostly hippies like anti-vaxxers. thought hippies peace love...somewhere along line turned bunch selfish assholes. anti-vax misinformation user banned. guy said didn’t need masks '71 Barracuda here.  Yep mom one nurses vaccinated floor. Yeah, one time horrible beliefs decisions directly affect them. sympathy. Working cemetery chain this, losing job loved pandemic, makes extra harsh. watch read decent amount Fox News conservative leaning news rarely encourage getting vaccinated, ever one statement pro-vaccine dozens statements discrediting scientist, science, CDC, WHO, literally anything Biden democrat said, constantly slamming mask wearing type vaccine requirements privately owned establishments... sneak ""ya sure get vaccine"" last 2 seconds 24 hours broadcast cover legal side things... know liberal extreme media bad guns far skewing stats purpose right bear arms, Trump side media/politicians encourage common sense way pandemic. Don’t conflate American ideology human nature. far collectively oriented societies, death toll nowhere near staggering 600K US. Vietnam, relatively poor country population ~100 million, 110 total deaths don’t adhere principle selfish idiot “human nature.” said “I’m Christian”?!?! Hell didn’t Give 3rd shot science juice please. People died covid hospital sweating hoax.  Astra zeneca two dose vaccine, prioritizing getting one dose second one... Well knows... Maybe never like uncle.

He got first dose mid march/april become ill june. 3 days got ill. 5 days ICU died Really? Weird cost dime. much pay yours? forgot /s problem new variants coming stay unvaccinated finally would need boost doses new vaccines future.  went Mayo Clinic first started find anything wrong suggested ""scar tissue"" chest infection sort. terribly helpful. excruciating pain chest reclining/laying flat gets better sit takes while. makes hard breathe wakes asleep. Sigh. Studies shown they're 80% effective wearer worn properly. unlike vaccines significantly impacted variants rely immune response. block enough virus prevent even weakened immune systems getting infected.

With vaccine, close invincible realistically going get. hear you! I’m glad least hasn’t dropped ball. Leaders AB gave us long ago. one group adamantly desires Olympics go forward people making money it. Olympic committee sold soul TV networks long ago. Glad hear it, part help end pandemic. clear, I'm agreeing saying. I'm doubting need widespread booster shots, first comment Pfizer's press release weeks ago somewhat contradicting recent statement. agree. think agreeing solidarity actually quite sweet.

Covid restrictions worse contracting covid people. Well that's hidden source behind lot Americans beliefs. virus spread mutate folk Southwestern Missouri may end giving rest America unwanted gift new Covid variant.

Why Republicans determined kill party members ? Yeah see people care eachother Technically true :) let's assume true. difference make practice? ""In practice"" real-life consequences, satisfying people's intellectual curiosity. think people take China court sue damages? That's going happen.

Add said earlier, people's behavior changed one bit even knew day one.

I'll admit one difference allow people (especially politicians) divert attention poor decisions politicizing pandemic, pointing fingers falsely claiming ""see, fault"". 

""knowing truth"" worth dime said truth practical, real life meaning. alluding satisfying intellectual curiosity, nothing more. I'm concerned Delta comfort plus variant. spreads comfort plus passengers. Picking seats getting extra legroom can't save now. mistake. messaging tailored audience. PCR tests return false negatives swab doesn’t pick enough virus. Depending timing symptoms, false negative rate 20% even higher. Best consult doctor public health test results symptoms.

It say vaccinated asymptomatic people need get tested, makes sense. also says unvaccinated people go bar get tested. Yeah, agree real downside. guess approach educate vaccine safe? 


At end day - scared vaccine. even said kids wants make sure die vaccine (so dumb, is) There's Yale Medical UK series good person. wish Americans caring protecting others, might better shape. problem using surgical masks instead kn95 N95 masks Sadly, no. get flimsy piece paper saying type vaccine received day vaccination don’t get digital receipt unless sign myhealthalberta it’s process get setup. card much simpler process. They'll always well received un Mexico link? finding hard find good studies Thanks. Fuck gotten goddamn it. can’t even sue fuck us new laws. agree. countries able escape Covid mostly unscathed. US, don’t think think expectation ever perfect response. would always complaints approach. downplaying restrictions mistake. Agreed, choice shut schools last year necessary evil going far now. Forcing masks onto kids 1+ years developmental stages they’re learning socialize can’t good. Thank god I’m Gen Z, can’t imagine that’s like. Idk man feels like lot projection still. First call someone blindly following CDC even mentioned CDC. mentioning ""everyone"" want hear bad news. coming from?

I like putting head sand, coarse gets everywhere, stay away it. delta variant much contagious infecting people vaccinated not. ones ignoring that, course we're going dismiss social media primary source information, notoriously ripe disinformation. 

You're also proving anecdotal information useful evidence extrapolate onto large groups. Anecdotes useful important, one set data certain set conditions. know friend's social media posts run contrary data collected independent scientists world? Lets say see bunch Facebook posts vaccinated people infected COVID-19 let's presume accurate. 

How determine percentages that? many vaccinated people also exposed get infected? circumstances got infected in? happening everywhere small area why? Outbreaks happen vaccinated areas still. high viral load passed around inclosed space 95% protection (slightly less delta) mRNA vaccines going put test frequently resulting infections even folks vaccinated. 

Beyond even get infected vaccinated generally asymptomatic mild symptoms. still chance severe infection, low. head sand here, something I'm missing friend's social media posts? I'm concerned long covid   Shit crazy. full vaccinated family Mo, caught week. Varying degrees severity (none \*too\* severe, thank goodness, sick week sucks.).  OK. That's free market works. guess I'm belief longer ""zero risk Covid"" day ever again. IMO, goal unattainable. time...

Meaning guidance could change point, even week now. point say ""booster shots needed, time"" Fuck Delta. They've lost luggage twice. I'm surprised they're accounting many cases Covid shitty operation. vaccinated?  get ignorant people getting vaccine believe they're majority country, get educated, open minded people getting vaccine.

Someone still make it, someone would get contracts someone would profit like vaccine. That's course actually worked hence reason used one actually provide proof works. I’ve told multiple people irl reddit vaccine doesn’t protect around still catch disease. It’s truly baffling told people idea. (federal government using national guard) can't legally ethically force vaccines... that's military dictatorship definition. true. received vaccine suppository light shines arse. due respect, wary avoiding particular risk =/= pathological anxiety physically harmful stress. conflation made lot past year regards covid. You’re necessarily perceiving symptom anxiety disorder someone drawn stricter risk intolerance line particular issue. Maybe someone different perspective you. maybe, fact, you’re taking things account person is.

Additionally, could make strong argument we’re yet “we’ve done everything can, it’s hands” stage. *is* lot evidence mild covid cause health issues linger past acute infection, still can’t say sure mild infections occur vaccine breakthrough also pose risks. also don’t yet reliable easily accessible antiviral early infection.

I understand can’t wait we’ve gotten risks zero covid, still aren’t woods completely, it’s simple one done, pandemic over, you’re vaccinated. I’m never flying airlines 😤😤😤 wonder many deaths debilitating long covid it'll take within 2 degrees separation, anti vaxer get vaccine. city that? isnt problem. People dont deny vaccine based political beliefs Thanks! found article little posting question. tracking San Diego’s vaccine rates weekly dashboard. think discrepancy New York Times looking total population county, local information based eligible population 12 years old. would suspect employees vaccinated expected wear mask. They’ll week two stop. one want deal confrontation, won’t spoken to, pretty soon one wearing mask one asking. 

I practical experience area. doing? hope it’s mild case you. Doctors no-win situation. lot research shown polarization vaccines changed information, cause people become entrenched. Doctors walk line providing information truly requested understanding people using blocker. cases, pressing patient may cause find another doctor delay medical visits.

You win battles can, knowing ones fight important.   I’ve using Vicks UK product called First Defence (available US via Amazon) since start pandemic, before/after I’m unusually crowded situation. It’s targeted COVID-19 (obviously, existed pre-pandemic), it’s supposed provide similar mechanical barrier viruses trying reproduce nasal passages.

(It’s really gross snort, whatever.) WCNC report valiant seems muddled. I'd ask got supply N95s (or equivalent) know properly fit wear masks. \^\^All this.

On top this, there's also things like negative pressure rooms expectations private/semi-private rooms. Pre-pandemic airborne viral infections placed negative pressure rooms (e.g. disseminated HSV, chicken pox). There's enough go around maintain appropriate precautions start considering using temporary outdoor dedicated off-site units erected preferentially COVID patients. cities, hospitals would work together even across healthcare systems, making certain hospitals COVID-only versus hospitals non-COVID. Took lot get point. UK start vaccinating Israel also extended intervals doses (whereas Israel stuck giving second dose three weeks first)? vaccine 93% effective preventing hospitalization, number vaccinated patients hospital much smaller number un-vaccinated ones? get aggressive towards wearing masks distancing. people’s masks nothing hurt them, yet… actually. US losing medical professionals. Obese people pay anywhere 25% 50% health insurance smokers pay anywhere twice four times much health insurance. rates obesity line smokers otherwise already paying it. Fair, though ridiculous explosion cases worried. I’m taking fda approval level. nothing technology. It’s situation 1.5 years ago. Ventilators widely used since then. opinion know better medical professionals decided ventilators needed, good you. I’m sure point I’m interested debating something saved lives year half.

Ventilators overused little doctors ready tolerate lower otherwise acceptable oxygen levels. learned treat novel disease quickly. Listen Dr. Daniel Griffin’s early podcasts week virology want know ventilators. masks those, vaccines yes? I'm exactly sure feel this. understand get it, hand, someone fully vaccinated protecting wearing mask? bit frusturating. people “lucky” enough live place like TX restrictions mask mandates already gone months. longer incentive get vaccinated TX (Abbott) already giving back freedumb. working sars vaccine years educate vaccine science isn’t new I'm pretty sure youngish people UK took vaccine order able end pandemic / restrictions earlier. MuH rIGhTs! one dose you’re still rolling dice gives fraction protection delta. 50%of population average. excellent news! anyone another article provides data spray regards phase now, release date fast produced?

Getting medicine like would miracle stage pandemic! strange hear Pfizer saying protection wanes 6 months also published this. fair, minor drop efficacy across six months according this, nothing like they're saying now. Could behavioral changes, don’t get idiots. many polio know someone did? Oh… it’s fucking 0 why? ….vaccines Kids probably never pick this, get snuggled bath time pre bath time sticky, smelly, farting, nose picking agents chaos. 

Wouldn't change thing world. can’t copy paste scroll “conclusions” segment TLDR. Awww thank u thanks everyone upvotes. Yes like miracle. know already like 20 people near died virus included youngsters. aunt intubated ICU two weeks. know vacinee scary sometimes thats nothing compared horrible threath virus. get re-infected one variants bye bye. need stop real fast.

Im really grateful cause know im minority vacinated parents. still billions without one. Huh? replied comments. Agree. Also feel wretched 5% hospitalized vaccinated. *Darwinism - believe thinking. fake prolife morons cheering ""We're going cause 100,000 people die miserable, unnecessary deaths""? Would terrifying? 7 minutes, comments seem getting you, so... growing correlation got vaccinated early — mostly January — recently infected.

My friend tested positive covid last week got Pfizer shots Jan/Feb. think booster aimed Delta variant, proved successful causing breakthrough infections compared strains. Ignoring problem solve  Haha, even California, theres going back now. Especially vaccines readily available. Even variant made vaccine 50% effective, still better anything 2020, nothing. most, America. could back 100k cases day wont get close level masking saw December/Jan. also work Peru, counter people taken like candy since moment first trials came out...

Peru one highest death rates world covid.

&amp;#x200B;

You version observational study, look people took drug compared didn't, little regard population differences groups, disease severity groups, reasons got ivermectin received it, reason get ivermectin reason it, really factor could attribute actual reason two groups faired differently. Clearly fact Mexico Peru done differently pandemic cofounding factors play. guessed it...randomization double blind trial evens differences. far ivermectin come short double blind trials. think results poll would meaningful unless vaccine actually available. moment one is, people reason would immediately find new one.

All polls fundamentally misunderstand people make decisions. start evidence come conclusion, base decision emotion look reasons support it. going beat fear logic. still understand people bring BLM someone says right take pandemic seriously. whataboutism silly. BLM protest police violence. point left start denying science tell everyone inject bleach. refuse get vaccinated care others. Lol cousin Lysol's packages.. anyone visit must wear kN95 masks regardless vaccinations.and nice stack kN95 masks used necessary outings, any. thought solid argument I've seen proof serious are, believed good grasp severity. 
Again think personally stupid say oh vaccinated go ahead maskless. Like no, say awesome got vaccine, remember masking still required everyone's safety DONT KNOW people can't get vaccine choose too. 
Just opinion. known mechanism coronavirus actually this? Close 80% effective? normal (non n95) masks? need citation one, I'm anti masker.  It’s also worth reminding sub North America (and especially US) bit outlier entire debate. Europe children never wore masks, certainly won’t autumn return school. might affect badly, still carrier someone else might vaccinated, auto immune problem.

Plus, creates another chance virus mutate become vaccine resistant.

You need look viewpoint includes yourself. called American exceptionalism.  way! didn’t even think that!

Just asking. You’re chasing tail trying accommodate anti-vax vax hesitant whatever. minute address argument getting vaccinated change argument. Dude, could written post. years ago went emergency room cause worst chest pain. ""yeah mate, dont heart attack. back""

Needed time deal fact thats back, heart. live easily, guess i'll fucked day heart cause issues figure whats causing pain.  someone care safe wear mask themselves, care protecting them?

Simply get choose actions (or inactions) hurt.

When decide care hurt person chooses wear mask also hurting people limited choices protecting meaning: people immunocompromised and/or young get vaccinated.

Also, people willfully take proper precautions strain medical systems hurts everyone works well everyone relies them. Thanks that. quite scary. Surgery tomorrow. 

I confess like term pro vax much.  like being....pro blood pressure medicine pro cardiac surgery. Nothing medicine comes close effectiveness vaccines.  disease killed 600,000 people one year 300 next one drug, would greatest drug ever. do, vaccine. (We would close zero deaths everyone took vaccine). 

I feel need pro-vax anymore need pro-food pro-air. things essential modern human life. take unproven vaccines someone vocally anti-vax means totally ignorant basic medicine. 

Anyway thanks well wishes. Can't wait over. claim *does* hold closer scrutiny, legitimate effective, could used prophylactic prevent infection? seem ideal wait someone already symptoms; may already shedding virus without knowing, already body damaged virus.

Even though I'm fully vaccinated would love protect risk even mild breakthrough infection, given uncertainty long-term health risks even mild Covid cases. Reports saying prior infection give enough protection Delta variant.  self avowed needlephobes excuse anymore. It’s public forum. There’s lot worse comments here. infrastructure almost everything essential, imports blocked US. healthcare system pretty good, although things somewhat precarious. forever. immediate urgency goes away, likely start cost barrier put like vaccinations believe still waiting get details recent pfizer data coming Israel; methods employed unclear it’s difficult know exactly data means without background information 1. 30 years ago

Many also believed wasn’t big issue vaccines.  polymerase makes many many mistakes replication, leading new variants. 

Actually, coronaviruses general highly stable boasts higher degree replication fidelity compared viruses like rhinoviruses, responsible annual flu. coronaviruses self-proofreading mechanism goes back correct errors made replication process.

We see fact despite circulation 1.5 years, original wild type still 97% identical delta variant, early immunity originally infected continues robust today, even newer variants like delta. early infected studied mid pandemic likely still closely monitored today continuing immunity seen reports losing immunity en masse.

The precursor virus, it’s closest cousin know of, SARS 1, induced natural immunity infected it, survivors found immunity still date 20 years later, even found cross immunity newer strain SARS. SARS 1 also coronavirus, course, closest cousin current strain. says closest cousin current virus pandemic showed high replication fidelity would expect coronaviruses, little reason expect differently current virus battling now.

We're still stage need aim preventing infections, symptoms.

Only reddit Yep. people bragging “largest protests ever” middle pandemic. better kill everybody BBQ! Using law protect majority, concept!

The US would rather let people fight amongst take responsibility. I'm glad made furious people think game. lost 2 loved ones nearly lost 3rd vaccines available. company still mask mandate inside. However, inside remove mask, hear peep anyone. gawd sake VP directors wear masks inside. Rather fit in, wear mask makes standout. I'm asking is, anyone know whether cases actually confirmed yet? searched time time found any, may missed it.

I'd look Australian 15-second transmission, transmission study Wuhan, Florida some-university-or-other meta-study transmissions. pandemic outbreak began late 2019 Mainland China, nation world's largest population 1.5 billion, reported deaths past 12 months stands 66th 4,636 behind Kazakhstan 4,647. residents 29-nation Europe's Schengen area, well Britain Ireland, remain barred traveling United States unless U.S. citizen spend 14 days arrival country Centers Disease Control Prevention's prohibited list. ""We found huge number child deaths COVID started compare U.S."" Fatima Marinho, senior technical adviser Brazil Vital Strategies, non-profit organization, told National . hard nail down. I’m sure it’s ever happened not. Honestly probably has, knows.

Okay, bring good point thought implied perhaps made explicit. way _disprove_ transmission method. example, see [my - fact confirmed cases food-borne transmission mean cannot happen.

However, intense epidemiological attention rampant pandemic, time passes, able confirm cases particular form transmission significant. tell can't happen, strong evidence form transmission significant component spread virus. can, instance, conclude need worry food borne transmission, even though theoretically possible, *likely*, chances high cases would identified now.

So I'm asking ""is possible"", asking whether disprove something. fact, assume **is** possible catch covid brief casual contact outdoors. asking exactly asked comment, less: cases identified real world yet? (And so, I'm also interested knowing them, many, etc.) company back up, don’t (ideally) find new job. you’re vaccinated shouldn’t worry. always fat old hunk shit who'd dead week got covid too. political say where. bot got original comment locations... also 4 months ago. parents drove 2 hours vaccine st. Louis makes say that? cant believe people take consideration want one creates variant kills us all.  understand viruses vaccines actually work right?  

The word mutation doesn’t automatically make dangerous. Maybe is, maybe isn’t. barely test it. go much work actually sample it.  exactly sequencing variations can’t even get original strain reference CDC? 

With said age group little chance adverse effects (seems like less risk actual exposure vaccine point)

I’ve made point, take leave Reactions board. barely anything, slight fever felt little yucky evening. know people felt really yucky second shot. felt better next day. boss take couple days work. Everyone bounced back though.

I would gladly take miserable couple days 2+ weeks feeling absolutely horrible. Also, wants deal possible hospital bill catching covid? Seriously, ounce prevention better pound cure. cure way eradicate covid. Well that’s great got skippping mask mandate 2 weeks ago Masks aren’t even conversation vaccines terms effectiveness importance. liberals like believe GMO foods terrible even face scientific evidence contrary. side stupidity. even address anti-vaccine movement started left part holistic medicine/anti-corporation conspiracy thought. 

The problem covid people like yourself, politicians turned political quickly could, foreseeably caused separation sides political idealogies. could completely avoided, cares many people die long political side one correct, right? Vaccine cards ought mandatory. vaccinated hospital forced treat covid. Thank you! alongside pfizer sinovac donation make janssen third vaccine applied big quantities country (we also bought moderna astrazeneca moderna delivered 0 doses moment AZ delivering slowly). people hero worship veterans constantly fantasize they'd defend country, first time country asks something them, literally wear fucking mask get shot, faux patriotism nowhere found. clue . made LOL 12 year olds don’t die vote, I’m sure point is.  never said did. 

That isn’t case I’m would split classes students. Hence hesitation. think vaccine developers are, takes time. hear MRNA ones fast make changes to, already updated vaccines. Safety trials approvals take time though “Ehh someone else don’t to.” That’s lazy, entitled bullshit - it’s dangerous. Thanks, automod! First can't let emotions dictate opinion matter, cannot eradicate covid. something actually impossible.

Students option switch back forth whim. set dates parents could opt switch. Unfortunately, simple letting Darwin oblivion. They're creating massive threat everyone planet long large number people willingly keep spreading virus. also gives ample time mutate vaccine-resistant strain.

What people willingly kept spreading polio even vaccine, mutated beyond ability contain it? Unimaginable, right? that's we're this.

It's like zombies real, can't tell normal people. probably known I’m sarcastic making fun comment. Hospitalisations deaths always lag behind weeks.

Admittedly, misunderstood works well, nothing worry people waiting it’s within requirements take it.

Because people causing mutations vaccine working well on. again, fundamental misunderstanding works.

But longer situation noone immunity. even virus disappear (as hoped months ago) go around devastating before.

Like Spanish flu hundred years ago slowky fizzle out. still outbreaks there, vaccinated eventually get sick.

We may even see booster vaccins, even newer variant. 

But eventually go final whisper. ever get tested? They've seen cases immunocompromised individuals got COVID never showed symptoms.

Covid-19 RNA type virus.. polymerase makes many many mistakes replication, leading new variants. eradicate virus, forever newer possibly dangerous variants arise. 

Best keep restrictions instead future someone love may dead. Type vaccine? One buddies practically arm twisted pharmacy get it. readily available getting something said doses going go bad used practically begged get it. asked insurance pretty much started walking away reasoning ""why need free?"" caved gave him. Well anecdotal experiences opposite, definitely goes along party lines. Mods removed comment. comment says , removed user. [Removed] moderation. Referred pain sucks!

Seattle favorite place I’ve ever lived god it’s built heat.  seen word ""affluenxa"" awhile.  That’s anti-vax. Anti-vaxxers always insane reason oppose getting vaccinated. They’re vaccines rationale.  could falsified quite easily find intermediate animal spread naturally through. two months 75% would vaccinated need one would 6 months year initial vaccination.

The efficacy vaccine isn’t wearing off. catch disease likely won’t end hospital. aren’t ending severe disease.

They want third shot make sure delta variant can’t start replicating vaccinated people. could end vaccine unusable said delta variant. Honestly, doesn’t become yearly variant shot like flu I’d surprised. We’re already seeing cases tick upwards unvaccinated areas it’s going get worse last stragglers decide get vaccine.  It’s hardly negligent. large population healthcare workers declined vaccine. Yet... increase cases truly explosive. real consequences  Upper midwest checking  dumb statement. know man. keep spreading around suppose. children still get asymptomatic select supposedly get sick:

Link, one first could find[link think line of, covering bases. Seriously amazing. Agreed, havent seen big push fir J&amp;J here, given Pzifer, location see queue vaccine could 200 people,it could 12.

Still document side effects. happening Australia smaller numbers. state governments taking control situation priminister refuses anything result left governments stricter lock downs rules combat outbreak right leaning goverment taking steps numbers jumping high day.

We also buy many vaccines would screwed gets worse dense. Even death toll low many people contract COVID long-lasting adverse health effects. 2 guys know virus last year still heart issues, 1 still can't smell taste. 

Don't pretend people dying higher numbers virus harmless. always protection Severe disease. covid makes sick days land hosptital one cares

Again, evidence linked showed approx 80+ % efficacy enough. risk myocarditis children due vaccine astronomically low. nearly every case linked child successfully overcame living healthy life senses tact. 

The risk child’s grandparent parent dying strain mutated class/school/city/state/country growing day case numbers grow. risk vaccines becoming completely ineffective due new strains growing day. risk accidentally forgetting breath breathing increases day well, based degradation critical thought. Woah. first shot july 3rd tested positive july 8th. know this. Didn’t party anything, think caught public transport.     know anti vax exactly think natural immunity way go. spoke some. seem understand way antibodies work well honestly.  healthiest person world, virus random effects you. know one guy, really fit healthy got rocked like screw anyone says nothing. Thank enrolling kid! I’m sure it’s scary parent, parents everywhere thank you. Mine (4) 12 fully vaccinated issues. comment reminds similar experience had. teen really bad cold lasted two weeks left minor tinnitus left ear. Basically tone I'd hear dead silence. second Pfizer shot amplified it. serious thing like article talking saw parallels comment experience. tell buddy work 6 year old son die within 48 hours vaccine complications son 'easily' treatable sons risk death minscule?

See numbers, statistics, opinions, work great stop number, reality sets in, realize people didnt die dead.

His child .01% chance dying covid, .0001 chance get heart inflammation die vaccine per source. 

His chance survival lived life like normal, recieved vaccine roughly 99.99%

 Minsicule isnt good enough, matter much want be. No, rest world looks mostly government media really news article linked: 

* *Pfizer said real-world evidence Israel showed decrease efficacy six months people fully vaccinated.* 

* *While protection severe disease remained high across full 6 months, observed decline efficacy symptomatic disease time continued emergence variants key factors driving belief booster dose likely necessary maintain highest levels protection,"" Pfizer said statement.*

I'm already 7 months. would like know long they're thinking gonna last No, no, data Jansen vaccin. Dutch government also pushing vaccin, available one-shot alternative.

Heck Jansen better work, supposed main vaccin vaccinating third world countries like Africa. That's true, can't take screenshots app. could take picture someone else's phone maybe. blame nightclubs lousy checks. fucked pretty hard..  don’t medical license. nursing license. Perhaps you’re uneducated one? Seems like subreddit keen anti-measures talk kind. Definitely echo chamber. Statistically, risk heart inflammation young age bracket higher virus receiving vaccine.  It’s uncommon healthcare professionals refused vaccine (that hasn’t approved FDA still trials American public.) wouldn’t clue. that's wrong. need negative test vaccination evidence. problem people abused system. Unfortunately Delta variant first shot less effective, least fir preventing infection.

So two shots needed (Jansens vaccin excepted)  Cool. know, it’s uncommon among healthcare workers declined vaccine. wouldn’t clue. Yes. peak week May 100.000 doses administrated daily(max 110.000), point vaccinations go down. month 15-20.000 doses total administrated daily(below 10.000 first dose). millions stock.

Look UK example, one highest fully vaccinated rates world seeiing constant days 20k cases Netherlands' response pandemic been, hands down, braindead, illogical approach entire EU.

This happened every. Single. Time. Every time daily cases start trending down, PM goes ""welp, good enough! Open everything back up!"" acts surprised cases shoot back week later.

This happened LEAST four times now. fucking infuriating. country run total morons. downside year wearing masks unfortunately. exposed regular dose germs leaves susceptible it.

This actually true.

""Coming contact germs spurs immune response, doesn’t anything make immune system stronger. current period contact fewer germs nothing weaken immune response able mount, needed, husband get first shot tomorrow. shitshow since day one.

Literally friends tested positive well. known gonna happen obviously wouldn’t gone, seen coming. That's pretty funny, get never wear mask anywhere. That's reason got it? Jesus Christ, think decision hard ya? Delta variant originated India. following news there, large numbers infections, hospitalizations deaths came ages 65. Indonesia crisis well due Delta variant, seeing severe illness death younger age groups. till mostly older adults immunocompromised patients, delta efficient, causing increased instances severe illness, death among unvaccinated, even younger age groups.  


The thing FL going is, higher vaccination rate India, hopefully means restricted community transmission. However case rates already 3-4 times higher FL couple weeks ago... we'll see weeks, since hospitalization deaths lag behind case counts. I’ve saying along. I’m nearly scared death potentially lifelong disability. Transportation may one place masking continue make sense long time. positivity rate increased 3% staggering 15% antivaxxers see vaxxed parents get sick go ""see vaccines work"". vaxxed parents catch crap unvaxxed asymptomatic kids. fucking shocker.....

It went mask mandates, work home orders, general Corona feeling.... clubs parties gatherings masks within space week. 

Literally I'm typing this, there's 2 house partys hear outside.

These best studies mix-n-match vaccines. tl;dr: viral vector + mRNA seems offer best immune response, followed mRNA + medical advice, final results still pending full review.

Cheers! 1) chose take it. 

2) It’s dying. possible side effects long haul covid greater risk taking vaccine. Sometimes death isn’t worst thing. People killed long haul covid. saw articles I’m mobile maybe didn’t scroll far enough. Yikes. Care source it? second dose definitely worth it. One dose Pfizer offers roughly ~33% Delta variant.

While countries insists lift restrictions masks distancing pandemic yet, happen. pandemic over. chance getting heart inflammation get covid around 10000 cases every million vaccine still seems like best thing protect despite possibility side effects.

Thing cesspool whether like nor. everybody else. vaccinated Went clubbing yesterday, showed QR code 1st vaccination got let club. friend said also one find QR code. searching girl told us get enjoy ourselves. (Meaning check mean shit). Inside poor ventilation 150+ people bumping grinding. 

Also office request us get bit often lately positive people there. Basically government giving public much control we're abusing it. M.mm.m..m
. R/Arkansas entered chat. 🤣🤣🤣 Western countries fuck everyone always!!! There's twitter threads day fully vaxxed people caught covid, either gave got family. What’s end game here? hate pessimist virus keeps evolving seems like we’re kinda screwed. ...And here's   Hello fellow Albertan, love trapped hellhole Official scientific advise OMT Dutch government July 2nd read: 'all unvaccinated people likely become sick next months years'

Harsh sobering 

Before delta variant still hoped would go away. anymore.

Everyone right get vaccinated not. choice really getting vaccinated getting Corona eventually.

Now respect everyone's choice, nobody force you.

But even best intentions *will* consequences. cannot enter Africa without shot yellow fever. different.

And think divide vaccinated unvaccinated people also happen. rest us eventually move on, leave unvaccinated people behind.

I'm trying attack anyone here. Everyone right make choices. choices *do* consequences virus going anywhere soon. 

I guess time tell... opt-in people wanting fully vaxxed without wait turn mRNA vaccine, scared mRNA vaccines completely honest also deeply concerned forcing kids back none us seem know ( even kids personally know lots parents) idea one kids love dealing covid causes extreme anxiety.  


Like said might wrong concerns completely unfounded want see 3 5 year olds love pay price us due diligence protect environments expect in. CA said they'll require masks Americans safe states like Florida Texas others require sure.  Florida already passed law preventing schools requiring masks.

Edit: bad, Texas Florida preventing schools requiring  governments ordering millions booster doses predicting protection might start wane 12 months one really knows new. saw that... Especially side effects caused vaccination. compared Alpha strain.. let's see Delta does.. Lucky you. I'd enroll kids heartbeat trial near me.  Saskatchewan :/ Selling hundreds millions product directly government purchasing every year holy grail business exactly investors want hear. keep developing suggesting needed good business, needed say investors stop flowing money in. province that? NS we've cautious plan numbers remained low. we're phase 3 5 reopening. heard PEI going recommend masks today think IMO early. know 2 people heart inflammation it. early 20s. galling part press conference. way washed hands decision fully open insisted logical time. admit take potential outcome seriously enough, promise prudent future. actually researched this, reason it’s approved (let alone mandatory...) younger children isn’t clear whether risk/benefit analysis favors vaccination age group. It’s unethical vaccinate children vaccine riskier covid - current data seems suggest may (largely due myocarditis risk young people, especially males) hence wait investigation. shots Pfizer kids vacccines vaccinating 12s isn’t cut dry decision data wise right now. Bruh serious? go damn doctor lol  Karens: **I'll take entire stock!** deffinetly try to, I'm sure major manufacturers want hear feedback surprised. friends living Netherlands posting pics going back normal long time even getting vaccinations up. way ai take TL:DR whole thing attempted boost vaccine take allowing people got Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine go party immediately opening everything? primary value vaccination program protect lives vaccinated, bring pandemic end. 

I tried explaining back concerns AZ jab came people faulty risk-benefit analysis doing. Vaccinating kids gets rid disease rips elderly immunocompromised, saving millions lives around world long run.

It's time accept every vaccine probably causes minuscule amounts health problems. polio, TB, etc vaccines probably yet undetected, unfathomably small number complications, we're better banishing diseases saving many lives process.

There 3 simple choices: 1) Everybody gets vaccinated, 2) stay lockdowns mask mandates forever, 3) millions die disease spreading unstopped. ""yes low risk group might die vaccine covid"" another variation option 3. I’d rather see fly list forever vaccines given Indonesia China's Sinovac vaccine; notoriously less effective vaccine.

Bullshit. Sinovac's efficacy vs original variant 83.5% efficacy vs Gamma &amp; Lambda strains (prevalent Chile time period study conducted) 66% 87.5% efficacy hospitalizations FYI, e.g. Janssen vaccine efficacy 66% vs original variant. Yes.

Long covid go excuse now, I’m sure scientists decided forget long covid random redditors know exactly they’re talking about. Inflammation. also happens one common long term side effects virus self. always amazes people ignore lasting effects survivors trying say uncommon side effect vaccine ""gotcha"" getting vaccine. less deadly. phase 3 trials, nothing else ever pass them.

Based phase 1 data likely 10 micrograms good non-mRNA vaccines, 25 comparable pfizer (which uses 30). currently use 100 micrograms. first signed months ago bit nervous, time trial started, covid landscape drastically changed: masks distancing thing past. felt like losing battle trying keep covid free, feel way relieved scared!

So glad hear kids vaccinated. It’s important everyone part stop virus it’s mutations. Follow *quick* money.

This strategy long term money making... TIL humanized mice are. googled reading comment. Thank you. always appreciate learning something new. much different, we've changed. Vaccines treatment much better beginning pandemic. legit site? explain spike? Btw, title seems misleading: doubled, 8-rupled. understand vaccines stop getting it, right? vaccinated test positive. It’s probably bit heartless say, frankly, people catch Delta die, that’s natural selection taking course. Variants big deal news would believe.  Yes according redditors. I’d also badass didn’t wear mask whilst taking shit one case guy catching delta bathroom even though vaccinated something yadda yadda yadda cares.     Thank 😊  one forcing go world unmask do. continue locking terrified covid. Heart swelling kill them.  Goes away day.  121 healthy kids died.  Since want break blame conditions. Bit said it. 121 kids conditions, died it. Could prevented distancing, virtual school, masks, vaccines. kids, adults around supposed protect them. ...and Lambda variant wants chance become #1... Yea big question. Humanized mice don’t cough sneeze like us looks like anti-viral drug would given early stages infection stop duplication virus. think would provide long-term immunity like vaccine. excited new booster shots coming up? 

I'm reading 'coming up' anywhere. company company said would publish ""more definitive data soon"" August would seek emergency use authorization US Food Drug Administration booster hours Pfizer made announcement, FDA US Centers Disease Control Prevention issued joint statement saying people fully vaccinated need booster shots would random person reddit asked ""excited"" 

?? ""Making pose picture?"" Good you. That’s great hear. made correct choice. Poor people general less educated less trust government. Minorities higher rate poor people less vaccinated. one quite good goes length describing conditions market. Basically designing breeding ground cross species disease evolution. Many different species caged alive scared excreting orifices generally spreading dna place.  What's even scary went Florida family vacation like Possibly. we're seeing UK they're fair bit less effective preventing infection, still excellent preventing hospitalisations deaths. made lab Hey please tell medical choices make life, I’d like know opposite make sure don’t end crazy lunatic. know it’s thing, nasal flu mist got taken market ineffective used years. People say time India, too, seemingly unaware traces Indian-made vaccines pharmaceuticals bodies right now. crazy. people know caught covid vaccinated J&amp;J one. UK people testing positive vaccine result Delta variant vaccines less effective preventing infection. Though, Florida really lockdowns, really easy none depression disruption service, virus. 

Everything's open, even go get cosmetic procedures done. noted one dose Pfizer AZ significantly boosted immunity Delta among previously infected virus: ""These results strongly suggest vaccination previously infected individuals likely protective large array circulating viral strains, including variant Delta.""

Also, ""Potential limitations work include low number vaccine recipients [just 59] analyzed lack characterization cellular immunity, may cross-reactive humoral response."" using since beginning. sure well stacks others. Try laying left-side vs right-side, see heartburn improves...

1. lie left side, typically sensitive heartbeats feel, pressed torso. upside position less likely feel heartburn.
2. lie right side, heartbeat comfortable, trade-off likely experience heartburn position.

Edit add: might try sitting take something like baking soda disolved water. Yeah, unfortunately think you’re right. hate guy, sounds like episodes arrhythmia, heart inflammation.  stopped tracking got vaccinated, according SS, number 15k+ days January.   remember hearing one UK's scientists say would positive way. would mean many precautions taken would indicate Covid become somewhat manageable. lowest classes - aside Kentucky-esque abject poverty - American society would middle upper class third world countries.

In way, shape form United States ANYTHING like third world state. It’s literally insane statement you’d hear Twitter Reddit. country 1.3 billion people, would surprising talking kinds death counts.

We estimates dead excess counts USA, 1/4th number people India, much better control virus, little control have. 

I would shocked fewer 5 million people die India end this. keep mind there’s probably lot unreported cases like mine

But don’t even know unreported case.  bad variant people got virus vaccinate? can't write say wise gotten vaccine virus. still immunity tho right? would wrong assumption lol  think ones running Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Portugal Malta. Looking ECDC data bet would Ireland, although bit biased. 50-59 year olds vaccinated Iceland. lower 60-69, may people want AZ. thing probably make real difference dine indoors likely indoor activities, need vaccinated option negative test. vaxinated scared of? doesnt surprise slightest, dutch politicians, midst pandemic wear masks protection nothing, people go outisde even sometimes shame others do, number people getting infected increased drastically. ashamed country thought better this. Erm here's podcast 4 virologists interviewed 100s virologists every one less agrees lab leak idea totally bogus. 

If want spend last year listening interviews I'd interested opinion them. 

I'm guessing extensive literature search?

Click open ""This Week Virology"" Podcast   trust Fauci feel sorry would never understand unless kids yourself. nightmares weeks weeks 4 months pregnant daughter pandemic declared.  freedom, understand. Yeah big difference western vaccines actually work research data. Republicans behind lot it. poor people color also lagging vaccination rates, something mysterious considering bad virus hit population. Would tho? Like could say covid, there’s clearly lots people without symptoms? would worry kids risks myocarditis unknowingly going run around friends dropping dead. clinical trials. I’m saying, it’s handwaved away delta works though. takes bit extra work normally blocked ways circumvent it. Who's excited new booster shots coming up? Can't wait flex grammmm. Ahh, fear mongering.

Of course it’s noteworthy. flip side coin thread full anecdotal evidence. 

Officially numbers, it’s extremely rare side effect. Fun fact, it’s even common side effect viral infections.

People informed. people aren’t informing thinking irrationally panicking it. *That’s* People trying avoid. India Indonesia shown level damage Delta unvaccinated groups 65

Can quantify that? Like got link? heard delta variant significantly deadly young people OG FL already seeing 4 fold increase cases couple weeks back

Cases deaths. Young people less likely die seriously ill Missouri's hospitalizations already overwhelming hospitals

Covid hospitalizations Missouri today still like 30% winter peak. Novel viruses concern everyone lacks immunity them. around everyone survived recognition keys fight re-emerge burn though Humanity.

There 4 variants concern. 187m confirmed cases worldwide. That's one variant concern per 46 million confirmed cases. coronavirus mutagenic. Mutations selection work sites probability. many sites virus genome mutation yields viable virus, many ways fold proteins. Presumably viable mutations likely occur already occurred. Typically variant concern made several mutations, totally break mRNA protection mutations still attached rest virus proteins vaccinated immune system recognize.

When mRNA vaccines beginning development target proteins fixed know much ways variants would concerns. fingerprints proteins like now. could come mRNA vaccine includes known fingerprints concern, likely emerge, end it. time goes people vaccinated number bugs even viable mutations come less less frequently still blocked they're attached proteins immune system's threat database. 

Or, eventually everyone variants catch calms low simmer childhood illness thrown ten thousand such. Sooner later runs humans.

Either way, go forever. it’s viruses work? Meanwhile governement lifting restrictions... Could Dutch fans went Austria Formula 1 race? One important difference COVID-19, SARS MERS COVID-19 lot chances mutate two gone people animals due contagious.


So even though antibodies probably last amount time longer effective virus slightly mutated.  There's definitely going issues relating kids particular exposed certain viruses. New Zealand getting pretty hit hard right RSV, basically seeing two years worth cases one time filling ICU's. distancing may weakened children’s immune system, experts concerned measures combat Covid-19 weakened immune systems young children able build resistance common bugs, leaving vulnerable mask-wearing social distancing eventually viral pathogens happens fairly regular basis although always lead sickness, exposure helps shore immune system threat bugs encountered said particularly worried risk RSV young children. “We’ve got two cohorts children who’ve never met virus, susceptible, there’s two years’ worth Zealand children falling ill high numbers due Covid ‘immunity Zealand hospitals experiencing payoff “immunity debt” created Covid-19 lockdowns, wards flooded babies potentially-deadly respiratory virus, doctors 46 children currently hospitalised respiratory illnesses including respiratory syncytial virus, RSV. number infants, many oxygen. hospitals also experiencing rise cases straining resources – delaying surgeries converting playrooms clinical space. housing situation there? wife desperately want move WA, maybe Seattle/Tacoma, housing prices we've seen online comparable house FL insane. hope not. SARS-Cov2 ≠ chicken pox

They 2 completely different viruses. completely different generic structure. (therefor) behave completely different ways. 

What understand ? serious adverse events reported *any child* Pfizer trial kids 12-16.  doctors nurses quit. 

Seriously, morale among hospital staff treating COVID *terrible*. people incredibly burned out, they're looking forward fourth wave almost everyone gets sick COVID denier and/or anti-vaxxer. 

I really think see mass walk-outs this, especially hospitals keep abusing staff. logic could used justify things like patriot act/prism suspension due process ? leading growth mindless rebellion medicine human knowledge wisdom? like FLORIDA, damn idiots charge.  IMO case counts everywhere taken large piles salt. Usually people frantically dealing deadly crisis focusing paperwork accurate recordkeeping, even places records nominally kept tabulated. 100% predictable.  messed fines overwhelmingly given POCs vaccines obviously super effective, wonder much also due people ignorant get vaccinated bother even basic mitigation prevention. Considering 5% vaccinated people get normal covid can’t imagine that’s true get vaccine. 12-17 year olds vaccinated many places?  That’s true all. you’re spouting propaganda Overwhelming vaccine power! Max fans coming home Styria? Severity infection related innoculum density, amount virus infected initially. think mask usage reduced number severe covid cases bc droplets would dehydrate.     rushing lot **negative results** people even **didn’t test** samples.

WTF, insane. consistency vs ""very rare"" issue experts can't even straight say ""yes linked vaccine"". Yeah I'll take it. Gov't India means managing democracy 1.4 Billion people, apparently individual responsibility non-existent run surge. heard colleagues India, people pretty adamant WhatsApp forwards factual. Either way, Indians need realize they're still developing country, hope becoming superpower day extremely difficult incapable objectively transforming country, especially met clashing political, cultural religious resistance across various regions. mean, India can't even agree national language, never mind agreeing national response strategy. worries, though, west welcomes best open arms. maybe gym even though vaccinated. would normally tell anyone go they're fine case knows. thought times got it, effective would be,” man reportedly said, explaining afterward decided go back even COVID-19 shots. considering J&amp;J-vaccinated folks vaccinated unvaccinated? 🥺🥺🥺 Nobody mentions J&amp;J much anymore speak fully vaccinated, makes wonder. hahaha!

A better measure would hospitalizations, that's we're trying avoid vaccine. cause people die mean suffer post-covid. Either way, article:`""...a majority (55%) died viral disease 60 years older.""`  makes 45% deaths 60 years, that's signification number people age 65 died. Florida's vaccination rates 65 pretty terrible.  Cases deaths. Young people less likely die seriously ill covid.

Cases convert hospitalizations deaths, lag case counts weeks. mentioned India, Indonesia Missouri examples hospitalizations spiked. We'll see results FL weeks. hopeful.  hospitalizations Missouri today still like 30% winter peak.

As mentioned, Delta getting started US. Missouri's hospitalizations within weeks, even portion state vaccinated. FL seem far behind 4 fold case increase, also occurred within couple weeks. We'll find hospitalizations weeks. Correct, COVID-19 vascular disease. news seems focus lung damage (usually COPD), important... ignores rest cardiovascular system, including organs affected (anywhere ACE2 found).

**Salk researchers collaborators show protein damages cells, confirming COVID-19 primarily vascular disease:** COVID-19 Organs:** intent scare monger. survive this.

Really though, nowhere near that. agree you. There's already new variant called Lambda that's making rounds. 
BTW, Lax adjective – Failing give proper care attention. Lazy synonym lax.  
You pretty close. boy data already show happens vaccinated vs unvaccinated Holy shit perfect storm. addition vaccinated, also tend follow mitigations cluster groups. Anyone know happened 2018? majority vaxxed county.  Sounds like though. Gives heebie jeebies.  doesn’t mention every time cold, flu virus infection risk getting this. lot us probably already myocarditis pericarditis side effect flu cold sometime lives.

If regular caveat every post past year saying 'OMG covid causes myocarditis!!!'  Speak yourself. live one top three safest states. Sorry hear that, imagine bad symptoms would weren’t vaccinated?   primarily children. Delta's increased transmissibility affects unvaccinated age groups. We're exposed risk anyway world vaccinated global travel trace continues.  Holy jumping Jehosophat!  end let take vaccine not? I'm hesitant rn curiosity also going go mRNA vaccine?  mean, suggesting goal smallpox polio vaccines reduce chance serious illness/death? Remind me, eradicated diseases. Oh yea, vaccines Tragic. many lives lost due misinformation fear-mongering?  Whatever happened nasal spray Covid UC San Francisco working on? remember reading last year. You’re asking webpage hosted Netherlands government website legit? reason think government hosting illegitimate website?

Also, yes clearly 800% increase last week. 7 days ago, Netherlands reported 1,123 new cases day.

That’s actually HIGHER 8 times increase. Freedom lie. Like equality. Science pretty cool. :) can't imagine would actually happen would amazing actually brought wingnuts rational fold. mom dies whatever. 


Again....not going happen. Illinois currently better Florida far case counts admittedly could change. ~600 cases per day (7-day average) vs ~3400 cases (7-day average). Florida quite double population IL, we're third rate Florida right now.

One difference Illinois, though, least government clear set criteria restrictions, positivity rate get back 8% 3 straight days, going back restrictions hopefully help bring things back control like past.

I say *should* expect significant pushback people/politicians really wanting go back restrictions ever again, hopefully still happen.

If nothing else start putting restrictions end back there, possibly then. I'm fully vaccinated still wearing mask inside buildings already, might start avoiding going inside buildings gets back   one thinks J&amp;J vaccine immediately effective, that’s simply immune system works, seems like blatant lie endangered peoples lives. Imagine that. I’m asking could replicate process makes virus jump animals humans. original virus could make mutate infect human without humans alter leaving evidence. course : Omega variant ! … end year? year half 3 different vaccines come sudden new worse variant comes out?

That true. There's still couple weeks delta variant rampage world's unvaccinated populations. surprised whole show canceled. abused system though? Clubs young people. Sorry. statement meaning efficacy correct.

I offer number sources look up. sad see people get fouled this. definition (""meaning roughly 5% people exposed covid get it"") correct all. Strongly disagree one ever said that. looked buying weights home? like halfway lockdowns kind weights fitness stuff hard come super expensive, might normalized little bit now. able put decent set together bought cheap bench Amazon. good gym obviously, helped keep sanity. 
 
I would recommend little 1"" plates couple handles barbell. bit work use compared ones fixed weights, lot options actually use them. advised people early wear masks. keep available medical field hands private mask hoarders. realized contagious updated recommendations wearing masks.

But, go ahead keep spreading narrative instead actually happened. say enough, someone believe eventually someone may die cherry picking info post. That's, like, human lives all, but, whatever. Yeah, like full masking everything vaccines worked. Yes, worked cardiologist year event. Romania countries gotten low case levels minimal restrictions baffling me. can't figure Ireland experienced despite much tougher restrictions one highest levels vaccine uptake Europe.

I think Denmark Norway best approach. Vaccinate people 50, certain conditions healthcare workers, truncate vaccinated youngest oldest remaining adults. Yeah, that’s really odd wonder sometimes bad something would *no one* could deny impact. COVID, say, mortality rate low enough vast majority form opinions it. kill vast majority.

I think really form venn diagrams everyone cares would like 5% death rate across age groups. think would mean almost one would know someone fairly close died. would room politics bullshit everyone knows someone dropped dead it. many stupid people country.

One favorite movies used “Idiocracy” can’t even watch hits close home! High quality information? subreddit 🤣 infected covid body makes antibodies target entire virus whereas vaccinated many vaccines currently available non-spike proteins virus simply body makes targeted antibodies spike protein. antibody test tests non-spike proteins (usually nucleocapsid ones) show positive infection vaccination. one ever said vaccines 100% prevent infection. They’re another measure help stop spread. rest world take precaution. Unfortunately, many due greed.  Pericarditis absolutely caused bacterial infection. said doctors told virus. every country countries use antibiotics loosely (inappropriately). likely doctors idea caused threw antibiotics (which pretty appropriate often works like this). think depends heavily messaging expectations. enough malones phase double blind. dosing phase every participant gets vaccine. double blind phase participants. think that's bad, look Bulgaria. curious patients underlying health problems (if any), ages, etc. compared last year legitimate question. we're seeing similar patterns types patients higher number needing ventilators cause concern.

I linked great interview comment thread. Username checks major heart inflammation (viral myocarditis) pain whatsoever. 

I aversion food, extreme fatigue, eventually shortness breath developed heart failure.  surprising. people SEA buy western vaccines China made vaccines day. vaccination rates still pretty low, needed immunity last week, month bit. they've gotten sick already.

These fully vaccinated percentages currently per age lot political positioning going too. NSW wants pride bringing control limited restrictions really don’t see problem positive motivation relating positive health measure. 

Society full choices consequences. Vaccines one them. still remains choice. Thanks Lol. ""benefit outweighs risk"" means probability getting severe adverse reaction vaccine (risk) much lower probability getting severe complications COVID-19 infection (benefit, vaccine significantly reduces this).

Of course people get adverse reactions vaccine. inevitable. getting adverse reaction change benefit vs risk analysis.

Anyway, hope recover.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Visiting family really choice debate. basic right people forced vaccinate something simple like seeing kids partners. anyone link study talks getting multiple vaccines, particular getting Pfizer already receiving Sinopharm ?

Thanks advance! call bureau statistics right make aware insights. got 2 doses sinopharm vaccine back april planning getting third dose Pfizer vaccine goverment offering want travel countries sinopharm vaccine isnt recognized. (Like want do)

Before taking third dose, want know information safety efficiency mixing sinopharm third dose pfizer vaccine. believe currently Canada Germany data soon (or eventually haha). Australia example? South Korea, honk Kong, even Vietnam ?

And many others. Much densly populated, much closer China India... definitely richer.  phone fit wallet either delta variant. think time argue government negligent. De Jonge outdid incompetent. whole covid leadership marked failures, allowing access day vaccination new low, even him. theory yes, many dont infrastructure required. working large datasets need good bandwidth, shitty company vpn frustrating slow quite bit.

I've worked 3 companies pandemic, one infrastructure required let everyone work easily home, mainly already scale up. 

When done well working home great implemented poorly employees hate agree, large chunk population giving fuck ignoring rules purpose help either.

There need real consequences groups. mean, there's always enough Darwin awards hand people deserve 🤷🏼‍♂️ Absolute risk death **2 million**. Survival rate upon infection **99.995%**.

Of 3105 people 18 died period Mar 2020 - Feb 2021, 25 (0.8%) died COVID-19. includes deaths MIS-C.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* studies show vaccines much less effective delta variant? first dose pfizer still effective 3 weeks.

Not delta apparently. However Delta variant protection lower, one dose Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering 36% protection symptomatic disease. one dose Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine figure 30%. Great minds think alike! greater totally predicted this. admit defeat. misspelled better. Already fully vaccinated baffling. people concerned vaccines now. kinda theory too. Like tested vaccines masked socially distanced world. guy vaxxed goes town club loud music yelling friends ears 2 inches ear, perhaps vigorously dancing breathing hard hours, super close dancers. vaccine stop inhaling lots lots virus, get big dose virus, going take hold. think vaccine kill fast enough, certainly much faster vaxxed. vaccines shield withstand huge dose zero effects, protect worst disease time.  Oh I’m arguing legality it. would definitely challenged court system, likely would make way way Supreme Court. Yup, think could bacterial infection need stabilize patient, they'll add general antibiotics med order figure exactly.   get uv lights installed air supply HVAC. Well, well, look who's inside Yeah. ain’t going away. Sticking fingers ears muttering civil liberties 5G chips won’t achieve anything...except possibly admitting ICU. Stay home. Mask public. Get jabs. encourage everyone know same. LA's vaccination rate low compared sf bay area. people LA need get vaxxed, sf bay area we're still super low cases almost everyone vaccinated 90% effectiveness would mean rate infection vaccinated people 10% rate unvaccinated people. 

Call rate infection vaccinated “v”, unvaccinated “u”. relationship is:

  v = 0.10 u

Now, take 40 vaccinated 60 unvaccinated people (to represent population). 40 times v infected, 60 times u infected.

  total infected = 40v + 60u

We want ratio infected unvaccinated, is:

  infected unvaccinated / total infected
  
  =
  
  60u / (40v + 60u)

Substitute relationship v u:

  60u / (40 * 0.10u + 60u) = 60u / 64u = 0.9375  Good burn, bro. 2 minor symptoms. rest non symptomatic.  happened may it’s news? Also, realized “yay you” may come sarcastic I’m totally seriously. I’ve seen many parent putting ego kids this. It’s sad it’s refreshing see someone puts kid first I'm sign up, really wanna know. hope states follow

Narrator: didn't. back 35000 cases states.... anyone super pissed anti vaxxers? forced America too. Unfortunately leadership weak take stand put us risk! extended family there. posting pictures social media getting together friends, going restaurants, bars, markets no-one wears mask. 

The numbers come surprise me. I've getting crazy scary chest pains like 5 years literally anxiety lol like definitely ignore chest pain *always* mean anything serious. also get chest pain acid reflux gas. confirm Pfizer vaccine. get hard anymore 😭  Yes. don’t want diseases infectious coworkers. last year gloriously disease free love it. Vietnam 110 COVID deaths population ~100 million. India's population 13 times Vietnam, means tried control pandemic effectively, would ~1430 COVID deaths. 2.5 million deaths (like 600K US) surprising demonstrates scale abject failure country's rulers. would vaccinated Americans lock Source? You’ll get stronger side effects prepared sick day least chill day, don’t anything day fine. Drink water after. felt like bad cold flu (minus respiratory symptoms) 2nd dose Moderna, definitely reminded much hate sick.

I think I'm gonna keep masking indoor crowded spaces, especially cold/flu season kicks months. new variants grown ignorant people, kind like already delta variant. % vaxxed? LA, 68.8% 16+ population vaccinated least 1 dose 87.5% 65+ population vaccinated least 1 dose.

People absolutely get vaccinated - question. Data points suggest one dose better none two doses even better (unless J&amp;J - one dose regime). However, unlikely large number deaths among seniors hospital system verge collapse like last December saw 20k+ cases/day.

I'm sure get people vaccine hesitants point anymore LA County/California experience verge collapse. give us license complacent sure else dice - point. Partially get perspective - I’ve got toddler infant. grownups vaccinated, still worry bit. Racist cultural appropriation Great! Without strong leadership like Governor Newsom would screwed. Hopefully states follow! I'm three months passed second dose lips still puffy, eczema still flaring. CDC isn’t tracking, know people vaccinated fight get tested also strict dietary practices, good, unfortunately aren’t well supported science (or even harmful).

Passion drive good goes far correct understanding (even fully understood, accidentally correct.) unless live island woods still infect people (even vaccinated people) covid. wanna die Covid without interacting another human being, go it. want part society there's excuse get vaccine. would say always put first world thought herd immunity impossible Delta variant. R0 8 means need something like 100% population vaccinated? taught masks year. biggest issue enough healthy staff. I'm 21yo medical conditions American rule too! bad love free dumbs. wrong. Press X doubt Can’t read paywall. TLDR? Funny, far inoculated state reside in. know Texans freedoming long time now. make sense. Bad people belong their. Black kids little weed not. See difference? Unlikely ever will. spreads easier, increase number deaths. I’ve never heard vaccine!! I’m sorry loss 😢 think P1/Gamma even worse Delta regard. amount reinfection happened insane Brazil. 

People got COVID, need assume proper neutralizing antibodies variant infected. Thank you! could anywhere 51% 99% headline first dose Pfizer effective Delta variant. Indonesia gov begging europe, canada usa vaccines since January unfortunately always lose bidding. 

So early days Russian China sent 8 millions doses vaccines gave doctors nurses. buy India stopped export. 

Finally around March, rich countries vaccines, started giving Indonesia stock started flow in. Thus vaccinations program started quite late.

This unfortunate reality. Zandvoort GP go Brrrrrrrrr full capacity crowd I’m still magnetic, correct?  I've seen many tribes refer Indian, referring anything official tribal name. know tribe part of, make feel? I'm assuming elders still hold that, that's what's pushed onto many years. 

I'm asking really upsets think younger generation thinks it. wondering ever intend officially change things like new generation charge.

Sorry question really make sense, thanks looking. CDC needs get shit together. bad 4 years orange racist broke badly. Except can't actually say safer covid (for adolescents) using data trial simply enough it.

Covid terribly dangerous adolescents; kills roughly 1 100,000 (about chickpox vaccine) hospitalizes roughly 1 10,000.

For Pfizer vaccine safer adolescents catching covid, would kill fewer 1 100,000, would probably need cause serious adverse impacts (roughly equivalent hospitalized covid) fewer 1 10,000.

Based we've seen adults, vaccine probably safer covid adolescents, study demonstrate it. 2260 participants, there's less 25% chance even one serious adverse impact occurs 1/10,000, less 3% chance one death occurs 1/100,000 occuring study.

There might studies published data *does* demonstrate it, searched yet can't provide links. Maybe someone else can.  effective masks spend hours enclosed together tiny room. It’s infuriating. parents want send kids school mine without mask it’s choice parent Right that’s honestly pet people missing. Pfizer look seek permission booster. That’s they’ve done.

Everyone acting like third shot 100% guaranteed discussion. reality Pfizer basically saying “we enough evidence approach FDA seek approval third shot”.

Let’s clear one thing well. NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING decided yet. Pfizer given data drove make said announce FDA CDC review recommendations third dose. It’s probably already hands trial oversight largely that’s looking ethical legal problems.

This CDC came saying two doses enough right now. That’s haven’t done review necessary either agency change official recommendations.

This literal fight semantics whether Pfizer right make announcement like this. Fun fact nothing Pfizer illegal. Maybe bit order (should’ve done joint presser FDA/CDC clearer worded message). 

But doesn’t change fact growing evidence vaccine wane individuals. We’re publicly given rate even med student tell us wanes fast. 

This clinical trials establishing it’s important step development vaccine.

Also talking conflict interests medicine manufacturing industry joke get pick test subjects, exclude, basically data present FDA clearance. third party independent reviewer established trials without influence parent company results ALWAYS conflicted interests’ grubby little hands them.

TLDR: Pfizer made announcement like did? No. anything legally ethically wrong? Legally no, ethically? doubtful given rather transparent efficacy vaccine. Yeah it’s known deaths, mostly AZ vaccine. think problem people using way claim vaccines killing people, risk contracting dying covid much much higher.  That’s best explanation I’ve seen whole pandemic. Thanks. Alberta screwed then? Yay you! Totally making right choice son. I’m sure loves needs yiu   son went urgent care yesterday coughing throat pain. tested negative covid (I'm vaccinated, he's young). doctor went say they're seeing tons cases covid vaccinated people. said likely delta strain, they're seeing vaccine preventing like hoped.

But say vaccinated people getting severe symptoms, that's plus. Hope okay. live argentina, vaccination sucks. uncle died weeks ago covid one dose astra zeneca  Yup got cold first time 2 years masked flight/airport. first I'm like...do vaccinated Covid? thing? nothing say anything cold, though, left Wonderful. That’s world needs. COVID cocktails. mean, really affecting anti-vaxxers, we're done bending backwards protect them. People recovered SARS immunity Covid-19. decade later. parent one 12, feel also continue wear mask distance much possible. Usually I’m 1 handful wearing mask making kids wear one public, can’t vaccinated feel everything possible keep safe. Basically that’s everything almost exactly time last year bit relaxed approach since know now. vaccinated nothing worry about… curious cause I'm lazy research it, England remove restrictions masks social distancing? reimpose restrictions variant ( ? name ) got England despite measures prevent exactly happening. Shucks, science hard pray things away. even convince Covid 19 really exists. parent, really appreciate that. sometimes feel like people act like child’s health expendable. one knows long term effects are. I’m asking isolate adult live (teachers) vaccinate mask up. Apparently that’s much ask China doesn’t “lie” cases much fact undercounted early Wuhan, much like NY major cities. Hygiene quality healthcare isn’t big factor early response, lockdowns, testing tracing allowed open up. Vietnam it’s quite similar 115 deaths, though we’re dealing big wave moment. Little know big mask corporations created masks insert micro chip face put on... Feds done horrible job communicating anything Spanish. point want people something need speak language.  read effective vaccine \~67% effective vs Delta variant. going spike hard.    People made choices. Let chips fall may. That's insane, depressing. government anything incentivize vaccinations? Seems like places tried giving something like free food beer worked well many booster shots think give, could affect rest world? long hospitalisations stay low ok right? thought would happening situation. could wrong. We'll see. guess is, problem healthcare system country advanced. Take look Indonesia. hospitals enough personnel tested positive quarantined 14 days. people west, might call fear mongering SEA, that's huge problem. wait two weeks fully vaccinated? vaccine shit catch covid immediately getting shot Sorry break explain increase cases deaths September December matched. would cause strokes cancer? point double standard assessing risks harm vaccines (looking total numbers including hospitalisation including speculative cases) Covid (only looking proportion looking confirmed deaths). want compare relative risk, *only* rational way compare like like.

This classic means statistics used deceive rather enlighten. trolling? I've never heard something wrong Yeah, idea kind shitshow normally is. point, hospitals stop treating anyone 12 years old hasn’t received least one dose COVID vaccine citing political BS. Malaysian here. got first dose Sinovac yesterday, I'm tremendously grateful finally get vaccine (we're middle bad wave 9k cases daily), hope country open option booster third dose mRNA vaccine later line.

No, given option choose type vaccine get (except capital opt-in AZ), told one we'll getting we're vaccine centre. can't choosing beggars, would encouraging know authorities long-term plan combat Delta make sure everyone gets strong shot this.  That's spirit. Nah, that’s full story. 

We opened nightclubs two weeks ago government told youth get vaccinated Jansen vaccin could go out. called ‘dansen met Jansen’ (dancing Jansen). course al lot people lot got infected. one club 600 visitors 200 tested positive weekend. either provide negative test proof vaccination (only 1 vaccin sufficient, ‘wait period’) via government regulated app could enter club.

Combine fact festivals opened, group restrictions let go, masks longer required et voila, get this. 

Part old rules place again. Nightclubs closed festival people cannot stay restricted area cancelled. wait 2 weeks got vaccin app gives ‘go’ go without testing.

But yeah, opening plan particularly misleading information vaccin keeping safe even got couple hours ago definitely government’s fault. lot people don’t know immune system needs time get equipped deal COVID get vaccinated trust government tells them. don’t blame people. Follow money bro Great fearmongering headline Reuters. 677,348 medical personnel received two doses Sinovac, 618 became infected, Health Ministry data April July showed. nurse died another medical worker critical condition. Possibly, yeah. mainly think fact clubs opened soon. UK they're still closed, bet soon open we'll see similar rise cases.

Probably happened soon nightlife reopened, young unvaccinated people flocked dance clubs massive numbers since they'd missing year point. think we've seen couple times super spreader events big driver pandemic, clubs obviously huge super spreaders. Man, sucks. time though, say booking city vacation pandemic isn’t smartest move. Well, Nobel prize winner I've ever know - fortune visiting researcher lab 6 months - highly amiable people sort person liking bicycle clubs beer. Major backfire going all-in Sinovac. Total incompetent leader. week’s time UK thing get rid distancing masks. 

They’re literally walking straight cliff. mass outbreak easier child vaccination policy.

Holy fucking shit saddest, truest thing read thread far. Yeah true, Tbh horrific vaccine rollout probably end killing bunch people anyway. person died (first since December) 90s hadn’t even received first dose.

This outbreak really getting control well probably cause hundreds deaths like this. makes little sense. Eastern Europe though, git like 60% ppl vaccineted already. richer. Sus af. can't buy them? UK another week go drop restrictions. 5G reception went roof! got full bars anywhere go! fortnight enough Oh understand that, going happen Title 1 school, especially time reopen.   wonder many strokes cancers cost Learn new facts, review adapt position.  

What want blend religion populism. Aye, believed fruit bats, no-one found yet that's conjecture, well-founded conjecture sure, conjecture nevertheless.  may sound like really dumb question, I'm originally Netherlands please hear out. I've noticed NL particular, huge emphasis partying festival culture. country basically epicenter world renowned multi day festivals, least Europe. I'm wondering addition covid fatigue, people's desire go back knew, multi day partying, contributed spike see even worse UK saw? young people, ones goes clubs. don’t even smartphone, deal that?   people need push hard proper ventilation, it’s best possible tool. They're saying personal responsibility go tits blame people following rules reckless, get scot free Maybe day accident ICU already full COVID-patients crippled rest life delay care. Increased ventilation, easy peasy, got money it.

HEPA filters? make furnace filter box fan. Vaccines work aren’t 100%. Also, large percentage young people (who goes clubs) hasn’t vaccinated yet. living restrictions entire time? can’t even imagine. didn’t know anywhere like that. (most likely) never will. 94% hospitalisation deaths. get small flu long covid symptoms

These things mutually exclusive. study Bergen, Noway found 52% healthy young people age 16-30 mild asymptomatic Covid infections still suffered significant symptoms 6 months later. 

Long Covid primary concern getting disease. big question, seen answered anywhere, whether vaccinated still 50% chance long-term symptoms get mild case. freedumb ""I got mine"".  
The level responsible acting lower grown-ups ever thought. People went military games Wuhan Oct 19 would interesting. lot rumours got covid really tested. hahahahaha

&amp;#x200B;

for outside Netherlands, standard argument Prime Minister uses confronted fuck exactly this. Generally RIP poorer parts Asia  Well, children young barely get symptoms bit comfort lieu vaccine. honestly idea implications getting small children vaccine trials, hope gets proven safe well soon enough. course, would also protected herd immunity country wasn’t full conspiracy theorists idiots, guess that’s get 40 years communist education another 30 neglected underfunded education, along people believe they’re smarter people spent years research stuff little minds cannot even comprehend. Sorry rambling, cannot help subject comes up. animals? Pangolins rejoice! question part like doubling tripling ICU beds European averages would buy us extra week two full anyway new Covid19 Wave/Surge point. Vaccinating vulnerable age groups probably change equation course extra 100 ICU beds example might actually enough cover Delta Surge evidence countries indicating might case. However fault NPHET Government abundance caution make sure thats case re-opening indoor dining. Industry Public could survive 16 months survive another month two outdoor dining till get ahead virus vaccinations. Get well soon ! 

Do idea caught it? zero covid policy. thing Australia many vaccines. Yet. Eurovision went quite well actually. 48 cases nearly 30.000 both. say vaccines (which true, plenty), fully vaccinated 8% population (one lowest developed countries). overreacting it’s working, we’ve reported 31,000 cases since start pandemic. missing cases leads spread leads serious outcomes. Vaccines aren’t perfect everyone even take vaccine. yeah, cases, even among young, serious problem. Damn, berating fun, though... best wishes, get well soon! 
Without judging: idea where/how caught it? look requirements meet approved PCR understand, they're even free. Don’t expect logic sub, they’ll downvote you. Oh wait… already downvoted saying something completely logical.  think kinda overreacting there? vaccines, locking entire city cause one death (in months) kinda silly. dangerous. Better hope start using ivermectin Perverse result everyone getting tested order go holiday abroad.

With high vaccination rates Europe policy measures longer based positive test results, many people hospital due covid. 

If vaccines work, overflow hospitals like first wave.

I think ok people get infected, long significant majority infected get hospitalized due vaccinations. game year. game long, I'd livid, too. numbers interesting scientific medical perspective, think leading us wrong path thinking.  
A country needs high vaccination rate, testing, follow strict rules physically curb transmission (Masks! )，then everything fine even Delta basic immunity sufficient keep high percentage people (re-)Infecting time. 

If start discussing percentages efficacy already lost. Delta variant seems lower efficacy vaccines meaning serious illness could still occur interests stopping spread till get many people vaccinated variants start impeding efforts already made vaccine developers. ain't it, chief. 26-30 July.  shit gone anytime soon Europes stupidity.

Nightclubs might factor, unlikely main one. must story. article: 
 
""**Of 677,348 medical personnel received two doses Sinovac, 618 became infected, Health Ministry data April July showed.""** 
 
618 got sick 677 thousand medical personal received two doses. math wrong, what, 99% effectiveness preventing symptomatic infection? 
 
That sounds really good, right? 
 
I bit confused article make sounds vaccine working.  personally think indeed dutch culture hold individuals accountable grateful that. personal opinion government blame. personally agree that. made mistakes situation happened long time, honest would probably made te mistakes position. thankfully live country different opinions possible. might covid. covid january, lost taste april. gone 3 months now, havent covid again. possible lose sort aftershock. END!!! (As person Netherlands)  shit, ya say. appreciate incivility.  Everything said correct depends mean vaccine. We’re ahead ‘95 first dose. Everyone 30 wants jab fully vaccinated end July. Every adult double jabbed mid-August.

And mind, it’s even insane decided open everything instead waiting another 4 weeks. rather roll dice covid, pandemic coronavirus, know long term hazards.

Big brain moment. several Missouri counties 25% full vaccinated. Even 15%. southern part state. 

Arkansas county, far SW part state, 8.5% fully vaccinated. don’t think county 40% fully vaccinated. 

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 1,000+ new cases reported Arkansas. (New cases longer reported weekends.) Delta variant made new case rate 6 weeks took original strain 3.5-4 months. 

With original strain Arkansas unenforced mask “mandate.” 1/2 masked. another quarter masking meant them. 

Now, maybe 1 20 wear mask Arkansas. distancing. state legislature since removed governor’s authority require masks, order lockdowns, anything attempt slow spread. 

Unless something changes, I’m expecting worse (in Arkansas) saw November January. joking.... also Eurovision months ago ofc there's correlation We've never used mRNA vaccines before, know long term effects not. something similar Ireland. gap AZ 4 weeks, 12 weeks brought back 4. also restricted 40s, that's changed Delta. Pretty sure try liked part society never satisfied. Hence dumb decisions. vaccine administered large numbers people later found scary side effects years line.

No mass vaccine ever used mRNA, speculated reason side effects. personally getting mRNA vaccine they've use long time, even 1/1000 risk serious effect worth me. There’s end covid thing eh  understand think hybrid may necessary contexts, talking friends, it’s mostly playing arbitrariness need control people’s lives pandemic. husband’s company decided everyone back office Wed-Fri, without regard makes sense individual teams departments. put it, “to make sure everyone crams pointless meetings 3 days takes home computer catch weekend.” I'm jealous. Mine (will be) two A4 papers. Remind 10 years net drag society due scarred lungs Lots folks access vaccines all. left behind vulnerable...you good level protection. Again, 10% total numbers TvT, 10% TvT tests.  numbers likely way ten fold higher.  That's eligible, precious leader encourage people vaccinated super spreader events?  ""Dancing Janssen? active memory that."" - Rutte get digital vaccination receipt? That's get Ontario. self report cdc using platform called vsafe. collecting data. county level. hope passengers sue cruise line oblivion. yeah crew dumb af.  Moderate NSW Liberal perhaps. moderate SA Liberal left that.  Well let's wait see. might third booster shot norm everywhere time. follow advice stay home they're afraid something like vaccine. ridiculous incorrect generalization.   normal vaccine hasnt proven safe. take maybe 5 years reach Yeah. read article. 

‘Weighing whether third round shots given general public’.

Pretty sure would start aforementioned groups. Hence least another million shots provided required.

And I’ll bet top dollar process start within month. Thailand conversation whether medical professionals sinovac get booster astra Pfizer. data needed reasonable question case noticed, things getting worse. 

And living rest lives semi quarantine. vaccinating enough people avoid mutations. Leading infected due contagious vaccines effective enough.

It stupid drop everything knew highly contagious mutation arrived. Thank you. dunno. I'm glad something rather nothing, hope get overlooked later they're giving Pfizer others. I'm happy hear friends getting Pfizer AZ, kinda wish I'd able get too.

But...it is. hard country outbid big rich ones, that's way guess. first dose only, comparable figure Australia 27% interesting see happen Uk! Hope keep good work vaccinations. Stay safe Oh boy go killin'  De Jonge said extra measures pressure healthcare system increase.

I’m sorry hear this. symptoms? colleague mine double vaccinated Pfizer jab tested positive. said symptoms loss taste smell burn nothing else. mentioned people age usually knocked week bed, least symptoms (albeit worrying) less severe. feel ok far? Israel said Sunday begin offering booster shot Pfizer Inc's vaccine adults weak immune systems still weighing whether third round shots given general public.

For now, adults weak immune system (millions?). Also, third round shots, mention fourth. source millions shots? Gotta put 5G chips vaccines no? /s would’ve guessed? know, saying value. ratio % vaccinated medical staff. think EU green pass since home country Netherlands EU need negative test  Thats thought. Nope. executive order issued prohibits counties, cities, school districts, public health authorities, government officials requiring mandating mask wearing.  iphone? sure works NJ california add apple wallet healthvana\~ look forward reading peer-reviewed work subject! Time stop counting cases. COVID either forever long time us. Countries enforce mandatory vaccination track hospitalizations. think would hard teacher sees group kids hall class wearing masks. It’s unlikely teacher would able enforce mask policy know vaccination status students. COVID vaccines required students, students continue wear masks seems reasonable (though I’m sure unreasonable response it).  shingles vaccine might good idea, though. exploiting ‘cheap’ labour country order affordable vacation. hang beach spain that’s expensive costa rica. it’s really deep. sure you’re unable comprehend me. also find something better respond random comments days ago. Best luck! Um, well everyone around starts dying dangerous going store. People breathing heavily nearly everyone inside long period time, many cases several people right next long periods time. also lot germs gym easier pick equipment touched many people sanitized. states laws schools can't mandate masks even students ineligible vaccine. 2 kids 12, live one states feel like choice homeschool another year. careless idiot going come school unmasked spread like this.  I'm sure enough data ascertain let guard vaccinated. I've read seen, vaccinated people get infected even transmit infection. Although, available data suggests chances hospitalization mortality significantly reduced vaccination, personally knew people died despite vaccinated 1 dose one person died despite vaccinated 2 doses (died 14 days receiving second dose). Also, children 12 cannot vaccinated. So, people concerned imo they're irresponsible. Yep, 10% cases hospital, 2% ICU almost half 55, cut-off lower 60. aus really big outbreak covid.

And Oct would enough everyone.

Still odds getting covid low.

Maybe 2000 cases max Sydney.

Out pop 5 million. endemic point. cant expect society keep going back forth open closed.

As soon kids get vaccine I'm done giving shit forever.  Lol I’ll take cold masking forever past couple weeks notice many people masking either. Like, I’ll go order food go inside use bathroom dining outside find staff wearing masks. Also, people walking pedestrian underground crossings often wearing mask. One dude sitting across train Brasov Bucharest last weekend told twice police put mask, kept chin time even face all. Brasov worse masks Bucharest though.

I don’t understand people don’t get vaccine. NY soon could get mine spent first hours midnight online finding appoint. Pfizer/Moderna. J&amp;J sold that's vaccine transform Covid simple cold.

Absolutely unvaccinated people, people who’ve vaccinated breakthrough infections aren’t even tracked unless they’re hospitalized. clear way know vaccine efficacy declining 

Considering could learned studying vaccinated people breakthrough infections, recent CDC announcement seems surprising. CDC experts recently decided stop tracking breakthrough cases, instead focus requiring hospitalization.  Good you. thought going getting standard/childhood vaccines missed before? still floating around too, actually even lot nastier adults (especially pregnant women) children. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* places care whether vaccinated either. Sorry, zero interest that. wish travel air mask order rescinded. means waiting 2022, it.  Sneak holy water places worship. statistics probability work, data mining multi-billion dollar industry vaccinated would worry. travel. Yeah goverment decided would fun group mentaly disabled kids make rules guidelines. Sadly decided use plans last minut shitshow got.

To summarize things need explain something quick: basicly goverment add show vaccinated tested negative. way still enter bars, clubs party.


Sadly nobody brain helped setup system problems still existed:

- would gotten second vacceine (or first using jansen) could drive straight bar/club wouldnt matter. negative test, waiting vacceine start working.
-the negative test 48 hours old. Thats right, go 2 nights row clubs test once
- swap test results vacceine proofs. QR code app (to log in, app need officals ID stuff, unlocked didnt matter, simple QR code.) people used one QR code get 10-20 people…
-the testing required partys done private labs/testing sites lots reports came test done badly. people claimed forgot nose went it.

Basicly everybody 14-35 went clubbing without real protection anything. weirdly enough noticeable. Yet..... lost Covid travel 6 feet air. 6 feet rule load crap. Covid outbreaks occurring kids' camps. Sending kids camp safe yet reality.  selective lockdown months come. would go there, crazy?! Maybe they'll nuke everyone space fucking end nightmare Britain think going unannounced herd immunity programme.

Pardon French that's really fucking stupid. data shows contracting COVID guarantee decent lasting immunity recover - certainly nearly much antibody response gotten doses vaccine. even vaccines seeing breakthrough expect many people catch COVID get vaccine catch again, perhaps again.  bs Sounds like vaccine good job keeping hospital. Framing irresponsible behavior ""individualistic"" wrong. There's nothing forcing stupid individual. purposely kept quite till after, likely money grab. Fyi Pfizer paid $0 taxes vaccines sold. probably see extra buck make UEFA anything, respective governments charge venues were. That's mostly empty others mostly full. doubt vaccinated cases generally milder, also - (devil's advocate)- raises question whether vaccinated bothered get tested make statistic. 

Saying 85% unvaccinated suggests tested everyone, I'm guessing likely heavily symptomatic (i.e., primarily unvaccinated) got tested. raising issue since lot vaccinated people think worth getting tested believe cannot get virus. comes free shipping? Pls. offended; ground glass opacity CT ""glass lung"" something new? cases spiking even vaccination roll outs? cases daily vaccines? 

Some officials say doesn’t stop transmission reduce symptoms. “variant factory” exclusive unvaxxed since vaccinated people still get virus help mutate. 

So whats going on? work? dont? help dont? What? Cant Decide Center get point understand western countries better position India March.

My point delta variant taken lightly. probably never end academics point view, time goes on, less less people care disease basically toothless vaccination, natural immunity experienced doctors. 

Some governments already going route, like UK. always going exit wave catches unvaccinated. problem countries half competent gov best, without wealth make west does. shows San Diego better LA county. central valley counties pretty low saw comment today made yesterday. want people respond inane comments make them.

 make sense. exploiting anything going there. go would job. explanation make sense. Caribbean Islands countries Aruba Guadeloupe countries employees receive high wages cheaper country. also Spain. cheaper country. Also Portugal even cheaper Spain.

The reason go countries cheap labor fear exploiting them. reason high crime, water cannot drink subpar healthcare.

I opposed visiting Costa Rica though. appears safer country region high life expectancy. Plus food looks good. Maybe reason people go cheaper nations afford.

And type messages likely using device made China cheap exploited workers working terrible conditions long hours. Wearing clothes made exploited workers. That's spirit! procedure cancelled medics felt risky share intensive care ward Covid patients

Vaccine availability issue earlier supply improved uptake high across age groups - might take another 10 weeks SG part +80% group. “Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine offers strong protection delta variant coronavirus, company said Thursday. protection appears last least eight months.”

8 months pretty impressive single dose non-mRNA vaccine.

Getting corona vaccinated get bad getting corona without vaccinated still would able get spread corona cases.

As long whole shit over, even vaccinated people keep distance wear masks required instead 'don't care others, vaccinated' mentality.  Yeah, quite sad ignorant selfish large percentage species sure. use yoga part lockdown fitness class I’m roller derby teammates it’s super useful.

Can't deny fools health care like want refuse health care LGBT+? get enjoy freedumb overloading hospitals. really, encouraging discouraging, information says little unless compare non-vaccinated people. case, well known Sinovac effective (but decently effective obsolutely worth giving access better vaccines). misunderstanding 100% effectiveness clinical trial means, though. statement factually true - 100% effective preventing death clinical trials - tell fewer 1 100,000 whatever number people looked at. always, always confidence interval reported alongside numbers, whether news reports not. J&amp;J (which know best, sheer personal interest) confidence interval something like 76-100% based zero deaths limited number breakthrough cases. real world, scaled millions people, number seems closer 100% always going rare cases someone gets sick dies despite vaccinated. mean anyone lying wrong, statistics work. clinical trials give indication vaccines very, good 100% never going 100% expand millions millions people. needed QR code either vaccination (obtained immediately instead 2 weeks) negative test (useful 40 hours, 24 hours most) preventable death.

No. least little bit research Netherlands making statement like that. numbers government decided remove almost restrictions 4-8 weeks early.

Pretty much cases people age 30, half hadn’t vaccinated let alone double jab rules removed. 

There’s almost increase age-groups fully vaccinated. Sure there’s outliers difference 15-30 40+ absolutely huge.  That’s impossible Thanks screenshot goes incapableCensorship folder. Nitwits forget purpose government ensure people act greater good self interest? Thanks response. link study? Ehhh, trust politicians guide us (even shouldn't) think really blame teens locked indoors year trusting government safe. Irrelevant point. really puttin EA shame really understand government decided basically remove *all* restrictions, except 1.5m distance (which (a) nobody really (b) less proven really anything inside afaik).

Everybody could see coming mile away much soon.

Though understand difficult balancing act what's needed keeping people board. could ever imagined would happen, Delta-variant, rules? them. still can’t find vaccine? There’s 5 places within 5 minutes house could walk get vaccine immediately, assumed entire US like live Florida. laws, get vaccinated, claim pandemic over. friends (many unvaccinated working high risk jobs including first responders, teachers, ect) unvaccinated claim ""its over"". 18 month old cautious going small health issue monitoring. one wears masks. one. made comment kind loud sure lot kids (obviously 12 2) unmasked indoors. Mom laughed roller eyes. one cares here. situation like NYC last year (which happen) one cares here. doubt even would move people. lot arguments hear ""it effects old weak"" that's me. political deep south thinking avoids science.

Probably. ""we still insist right way, mistakes part"". fuck Rutte generally, public health hands public    think saying care general. Like don’t get vaccinated, insurance company end coverage entirely increase premiums, like smokers pre-existing conditions. force hand get vaccinated alternate health coverage anything. Won’t happen many people get insurance employers.  plus: festival basicly called ""vax party"", giving people idea get jab, safe. takes 2 weeks build resistance virus tho. imagine huge festival unmasked, 0 protection vaccine, people. Thank you, willingness people absolve government wrongdoing simply Rutte said “it’s night clubs responsibility” dumbfoundingly simple minded.

The easing measures obviously bad incompetent move, people realising reason. Cuz idiots put mask cuz freedum anti vaxx Morons prolonging shit. nothing screwing around numbers everything fact lifted pretty much every restriction 4-8 weeks early. I’m blaming people like dude, hope people able get vaccine ASAP. Look studies transmissibility severity Delta variant. 

One observations virus seemed “effective” taking hold causing lung issues. 

This could one reasons what’s observed. Oh good need boosters! Vaccinated breakthrough cases significantly less chance long term symptoms unvaccinated. 

Exact figures hard pin down. One recent observational study shows 30% reduction, numbers confounded somewhat knowing many didn’t get sick enough even seek medical attention begin with, likely 30%, get symptoms all, it’s least much. comes virus borders. shame separated world things like make seem like not.  ask questions, honestly. eg. climate change  mention Hawley. KS isn’t much better, like governor lot that’s sure made appointment GP last week mentioned even though masks mandatory required wear one appointment. Similarly dentist. 

I’ve also heard story friend mine hospital appointment last week need wear mask. fact one wearing one inside hospital. really baffled tbh. Especially since went ENT appointment … vaccines low efficacy fact.

There never head head study vaccines make statement. studies give SINOVAC 50% efficacy done completely different conditions one gives Pfizer 93% efficacy.

it like comparing two distinct cars, putting one completely different road, drivers different skills levels, different weather conditions, arguing cars fastest. 

That pretty much compare effectiveness different vaccines. 

I get it, like China. mean vaccine bad. Holy misinformation. AZ didn’t fail, Aus govt did. Made classic error assuming human decency central gouvernement says 17.6 million vaccinations. almost entire country. coming people say corona increased 800%. Kinda weird ask me. FL vax rate US average. 79% 65 plus fully vaxed 56% 18 plus. Single shot data 10% higher cases hopefully people get 2nd shot.

Its state keep eye sure Yet American abroad, can’t get vaccine local embassy four miles away. No. Janssen/J&amp;J one shot; agree you, KO hours second moderna No, approved yet. “You mean care people too? communist China?” - 60% people state  vaccine available. It’s also crazy American, walk 5 minutes direction house find somewhere get shot immediately. Americans excuse getting vaccine yet, walk Walmart, cvs, grocery store etc walk vaccine. completely understand anxiety. mom got J&amp;J months ago news articles questioned J&amp;J certainly felt anxiety family. 
 
In world news tries hard elicit clicks, important let numbers science talking. one say definitively actual studies published, point consistent denigration Chinese vaccines.

Yup long resume donating glyphosate dump rural communities airplanes that's good. sure? read many people side effects lasting weeks. true majority people may side effects, according article 6% people missed second dose, must percentage people get second dose side effects first dose. one ridiculous title, fact uncertainties exist mean ""you can't compare"". point 7 min video makes variants exist, already mentioned previous message. It’s valid point. argument regarding vaccine protecting cost benefit analysis. Delta variant said minor illness vaccinated folks. many vaccine enough mitigation other? factor stance officials taken longer requiring precautions vaccinated people. result vaccinated people feel safe won’t jump hoops avoid getting sniffles.

I get transmission might thing vaccinated unvaccinated think empathy tank running fumes caring responsible people face much indifference, ignorance hatefulness. 

This isn’t argue people shouldn’t take precautions give insight people choose do. Well 12 17 still require parents consent vaccine, get sick, fault. parents fault. COVID vaccines still emergency use authorization covered things like national VICP.

Until changes harder support mandatory COVID vaccines public schools. state government going require something something federal government stands behind safe without qualification.

History shows common pattern. new vaccines released, unknown side effects, any, show within two months vaccination. This history goes back least 1960s oral polio vaccine examples continue today.

Because this, scientists public health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, vaccine becomes available public.

That's completely untrue. Scott Morrisson even laid roadmap moving elimination endemic covid four phases. Australian govt invested multiple vaccines mid-2020 assured populace would front queue vaccines. sure talking vaccination talk actions demonstrated lack resolve front recently.

That's comletely different claimed above, thought lockdowns permanent solution. Australia messed vaccine campaign betting heavily AZ homegrown one abandoned. failed rushed secure others, back queue. 

There big difference messing vaccine roll-out bothered all.

University Bergen showing 52% healthy adults age 16-30 mild infections requiring hospitalisation still symptoms 6 months later. common loss taste/smell (28%), Fatigue (21%), Shortness Breath (13%) impaired concentration (13%). 

So, again, studies show people mild infections vaccinated risk outcome? Seriously, study showing want know it. Things looking shit Spain too, 20k cases per day. understand e.g. Italy little cases (1k) per day. Personally I'd guess like 50:50 know difference virus bacteria. Even proves nothing lab, debating safety standards research probably worthwhile exercise. Hospitalisations low point graph THIS. 

People still can't seem get this. good example get vaccinated viral video Tiktok lady (38 years old) NJ. apparantly posted anti vax COVID denying content past seen weeks ago unmasked events people. got COVID, double pnuemonia lungs, liver issues. kids got sick mild cases, ended hospital forced oxygen.

I mean REALLY REALLY need stop talking point.  data available good skipping second shot. efficacy significantly diminished skipping second shot. people likely get hit hard delta, importantly, follows delta. discouraging. people become severely sickened virus, opportunity mutations evade vaccine together. students same

Yes, treats students dangerous disease vectors actively harboring infections, ready able infect others times, even not, even already recovered covid possess natural immunity renders negligible transmission threat. mean ""believing"" 5G networks?.. What's even ""believe"" into?

Ham.... interesting POV. must say. similar symptoms incubation rates. think fair draw conclusions fast 100 years apart population half smaller. connections countries almost impossible.... idk man. like optimism hopfully right haha ;) gl reviews evidence COVID-19 mRNA vaccination uninfected previously infected persons elicits cross-variant neutralizing antibodies, directed evolution bacterial protein form virus-like capsid specifically packages encoding mRNA. think heard all. lot aren’t necessarily bad people

A person judged actions beliefs. think best argument *for* boosters specific populations *need* either sterilizing immunity, otherwise unlikely lasting effective immunity. probably healthcare workers, high exposure workers, immunocompromised (that still benefit vaccination/boosters), elderly. good alternative people extremely afraid needles. Well, think right, thanks taking time respond well, I'm going get vaccinated soon possible. Probably like 5-6 days later. 


Wishing much healings, stay safe &amp; take care. \^\^ Aha. phase 1 participants got show results, google searches turns news last days. Moderna results easier still trial results delta-specific booster (or multivalent vaccine including delta spike), 100% need doing. think we'll get everyone, think going necessary get every single person vaccinated. Natural immunity combined vaccination sufficient. Normally viruses mutate less lethal. Delta variant case numbers high England now. could right hoping best. Hardly anyone even going hospital Netherlands Yesterday, 83 percent coronavirus deaths across Europe occurred Russia. complete disaster. today, evidence support needing booster scientific approach. know circulating antibodies drop 8-12 months. completely normal process. reason believe still immunity due B cell response presence virus. 

With new virus, everything speculation. still possible need booster future gain better understanding mechanisms involved. 

Nonetheless, circulating antibodies every vaccine virus, booster received, blood would thicker oil. rely memory cells presence virus.

This likely profit driven companies. Yep… people don’t even bother protect likely don’t give crap protecting people around them.

US valid medical concerns spreading new variants travel

I'm sure cite valid medical concerns Indonesia, Russia, Mexico, Thailand etc (all countries far higher rates new cases EU) perfectly open travel, China (which given case rates long since removed ban) blocked...

Plus, tonne regulations diminish medical risk e.g. EU. Like sort self-quarantine/testing regime rest developed world insisted upon travellers last year... would block tourists allow, example, family members see loved ones.

What going head? age ranges highest vaxx rates astronomically risk. vaxx rates high elderly have, death rates thousands times higher, %'s start get little funky. 

46 people hospitalized population several million. numbers low, things get janky. Next season Ozark, everyone dies Delta, except Byrde family. Americans need 3rd boosters. rest world needs 1st shot first. Pfizer *want* new variants keep showing up? Actually wait.... I'm effective treatments possible, think many people pretty major disconnect reality comes risks vaccines vs. risks drugs treat illness. Vaccines stimulate process body designed naturally constantly doing. Drugs much complicated essentially trying induce body things designed attack specific undesired thing body leaving everything else untouched. *much* difficult fraught risks, immediate measurable unknown long-term effects. fully-vaccinated person relatively low-risk demographic I'd feel hesitant take pill prescribed tested positive risk profile well established. true everybody least. 2 friends part trial US didn’t boosters. Hopefully neither one gets covid. well could result hospital stay even ICU worse wouldn’t mental all, physical problem survived could also cause mental issues.  inevitably encounter diseases later life, exposed school? could end causing severe illness later life immune system adaptable. can't vaccinate people everything, although I'm sure share sentiments eagerly awaiting norovirus vaccine! I’m CA hear time  think restrictions managed keep Rt &lt; 1 everybody chance doses vaccine, little bit margin (perhaps 2-4 weeks allow administrative errors etc.). 

Once everybody ample opportunity vaccinated, restrictions lifted general, mask mandate maintained least next Spring order help reduce winter pressures NHS make progress backlog.

People continue work home possible indefinitely, apart COVID-19, commuting waste time causes unnecessary environmental damage, law changed incumbent upon employer demonstrate work cannot done remotely wish deprive employees right work home.

Ultimately, think public health committee analogous Monetary Policy Committee Bank England would responsibility management public health related laws / need NPIs manage pandemic risk, decisions made rapidly apolitically. 

In short term, would facilitate management travel restrictions, continue necessary manage risk new variants emerge. adults work schools aren’t always able receive vaccine one reason another. 

Then present risk schools permitted continue working there. trust people everything keep family healthy, hard 2nd Pfizer dose 2021-06-25, fast-forwards 6 months to...Christmas Day a.k.a. peak COVID season? Whoops... Dumb argument, better idiot anti vaxxers also anti mask. I'm novavax trial US. vaccine least painful minimal side effects. reaction saline placebo. People love “you I’ll me” argument. live vacuum everyone wore clear mask would change mind. able see people speak expression big negative masks IMO. still agree CDC circumstances unvaccinated people wear masks. CA took away 12+ ask worth it, also CA knee jerk reaction without truly thinking through. hearing impaired point example. think UK stretch doses, preferring give people first dose (65% protection) rather half population two doses (98% protection) half without. think Canada thing. Delta variant made plans seem less desirable. parents want kids get COVID, period

You aware people catching covid even regions strict mask mandates high compliance?

Even believe mask mandates lower rate transmissions, doesn’t eliminate possibility. parent wants eliminate possibility infection long covid costs, best move would pull children school, even schools require masking. Well, I'm also scared physical pain well, hurts, hurt much? ( arm pain, etc. ) I've seen people saying hurt like 10/10 level. ) *former guy call me? 100% agreed   Yeah that's really selling point types people refuse vaccines non-medical reasons.. many years expect take fully vaccinated global population? think unreasonable object inculcating excessive fear subsection population vulnerable disease.

I'm sure guess way is. unsurprisingly, double sometimes triple vaccine rate surrounding counties. think answer much simpler ""secret brain eating parasite""  I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask.
I've Covid 19 twice.
The first time critically ill 8 weeks double pneumonia left lifelong health issues.
To make matters worse caught beginning February ( even though wear mask practice hand hygiene) entitled people wear mask wash hands seem like touching produce supermarket .

I assure much fluid lungs feel like drowning try lie fun all. sample size 400. Compare sample size UK studies 15,000.  would think so. really anyone still needs explained them?

It's rocket science, folks. search 'expire[d]' refers shelf life. work daycare reopened July last year. 12 children 3 staff per classroom. teachers never take masks children time ( besides eating sleeping). We've 10ish exposures within school past year transmission. masks something. “I got vaccine, don’t care ~~didn’t~~ refuse to.”  Pfizer/BioNTech less mRNA Moderna...I wonder both. depth idiocy shocking.

My coworker took shot day husband side effects mild.

My coworker anti-vaxxer. still pro-vaccine believes people general vaccinated covid still believes side effects rare. However husband decided taking second shots, personal decision them. three 18 kids believe factor, want risk leaving kids without one parents.

I know one anecdote many call bullshit, observation may least part explain people chosen follow second shots.

Edit: also, science reports people already recovered covid infection need one shot achieve full protection. infected, asymptomatic

China count positive result Covid case unless person eventually develops symptoms. got zerocovid. Except is, 30% people country 330+ million (that's roughly 90 million people) think virus either dare infect believe virus exists first place.

That's also potentially 90 million chances virus mutate vaccine resistant strain. doubt will, that's selective pressure works viruses, there's non-zero chance. I've lost grandparents covid, unlike bring feelings emotions win arguments. 

You understand feels like lose job covid, idea privileged dire situation pandemic.

Yeah again, COVID. incidence unknown long term side effects COVID could also pretty severe point guaranteed catch Delta variant choose remain unvaccinated issue nasal oral vaccines usually produce antibodies mucosa exposed too. WOULD likely work preventing spread know nose mouth main routes transmission.

However, I’d like see long term efficacy method vs non-mucosal infection methods. Like eating contaminated food yes contact mucosa mouth moves system, coming contact non-vaccinated areas.

More work obviously needed looks like we’re finally trying light fire area research. opium epidemic, rural economies drying creating desperate poverty, billionaire funded misinformation campaigns, new AIDS crisis parts rural midwest, two national political parties interested addressing this, COVID even list difficult hardships people.  Unlikely. demand never unless mutates Ebola. US I’d surprised half people got first round get back line readily third dose.

I also didn’t start getting sub vaccinated, wish hadn’t. I’m even subbed keep coming back like moth flame. vaccine hesitant people aren’t saying “the vaccine bad.” saying vaccine might side effects haven’t uncovered.

Now, vaccinated, don’t need anyone telling think wrong. Yeah like drunk driver wraps around tree. Sure sad, limited sympathy someone that's recklessly endangering others. missed father's funeral pandemic. still think relaxing restrictions know dozens adults still waiting appointments first shot. also think lives 12 expendable. Get pull mask nose. pandemic got vaccinated. Furthermore, UK's death statistics still risen significantly despite surge cases starting month ago. Seems vaccine effective death variants currently spreading there.

Remember: cases matter. Deaths hospitalizations focus on.  wearing mask indoors prevent reopening? cashier check someone well without mask. Someone buy something (most) stores well without mask.  don’t understand sub amount people won’t accept pandemic way out.

Put perspective. Moderna, Pfizer AZ vaccines trial since early 2020 Covid room circulate constantly mutate protection. year later variants circulation, vaccines remained effective. people vaccinated lot people antibodies variant evade vaccine? It’s possible, certainly unlikely, even antivaxxers. variants may diminished effectiveness neutralization certainly hasn’t changed severe disease hospitalization rates, that’s matters. Ah okay, I've seen this. seem talk whether vaccine would make difference ability SPREAD virus, though? whether they'll harsh symptoms not... must understand taxes work. child unvaccinated high risk, may choice split classes. Public schools obligated provide educations. mask infighting results reveals mask mandates, parents compromised children ineligible unable justified keeping children home due increased risk. Remember: masks effective infected person wearing it, wearing mask around unmasked students still comes increased risk. force districts continue online components next school year enough kids prevented person classes.

3) Masks work right kinds worn correctly work even better… vaccine another layer protection doesn’t rely users interpret properly use PPE. Swiss Cheese Model that. That's exact date too. Also wondering get again. far….. Mona Moore, watch news, hope you’ll consider reading news. lucky enough live area still independent newspaper, that’s great place start, it’s also good idea read national newspaper like New York Times Wall Street Journal (both come editorial viewpoints also big newspapers reporting strong ethical standards reporting). Studies show right-leaning news shows tabloids less factual centrist left-leaning ones, watch Fox, you’re getting low information. Best least get something else mix make sure getting information. great news sources: BBC, Al Jazeera, Reuters, NPR (public radio) know US Japan sent vaccine doses. maybe others I'm aware of.    good stance someone medical condition either can't get vaccinated doesnt want risk it. good stance someone ""medical condition"" though. They're already free though.   Ah yes, immediately bring politics discussion   It’s clear cheering, don’t trust government approve vaccine.

That's accurate. listen say opposed vaccines--the anti-vaxx crowd vocal small. main issue see pandemic liberal excuse take away freedoms; notion makes cling guns. 

BTW, new. Many arguments conservatives making today arguments conservatives made 1918 pandemic. view freedom worth dying.  Sure trust government research statistics yourself. Vaccine saving lives stat find whether trust government not.

Problem people distrusting government, also even research themselves. clear day states like mine (New York) vaccines work, life basically back normal 70% vaccination. 

But personally agree people free choose want vaccine not, also smart enough know one better safer getting covid.  ""news"" usual sense news ""new"". sure various others pre-clinicals, though sure protease inhibitors.

The Folding Home project handful researchers taken differing approaches finding anti-virals. results indicate may found anti-viral would work known coronaviruses. resulting pill/formula would open source anyone produce: might young healthy people. Personally, since I'm neither work around plague rats immune compromised people home, really want take gamble.  fat people smokers then. pretty good news. ... universe liberals turn deadly disease political? morons right we're downplaying damn thing beginning refusing wear masks follow guidelines. Really cool revisionist memory got there. number times replicates like car manufacturers continuing upgrade make vehicles. older ones worked making efficient. supposed work? Weird it’s unvaccinated overwhelmingly make people getting hospitalized. co-inky-dink. Especially because, CDC explains repeatedly dummies every day: “natural immunity” highly unlikely last super long you’re still much risk variants. hey, endanger public guess.  point, place left USA person wants covid vaccine can't get one. 

Of course that's true true. no, people dun fucked up. i'm fully vaccinated really worried future cases administered least 17,191,580 doses COVID vaccines far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough vaccinated 49.6% country’s population.  administered least 9,092,141 doses COVID vaccines far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough vaccinated 23.5% country’s population.

fuuck. 

/edit: seriously tho, happened?  That’s true. However liberals aren’t better Problem SARS2 asymptomatic carriers spread disease. goes presymptomatics. Yes, is.

This argument vaccinated. I’ve taken fair share recreational drugs I’m afraid little vaccine could quit something else, choices. move somewhere people actually choose take life saving vaccine. like healthcare workers demand pretty much everywhere.

Yeah hard them, literally job. Meanwhile, CPAC cheers low vaccination numbers. 

Both sides though, right jackass? sorry, i'm replying generate tone responses. nuts see people saying side effects 1-2 days everyone... without presenting evidence case... even face evidence 12% peopel symptoms week later gets downvoted. 

It's like anti-vax attitude, except direction... nothing ever negative getting vaccine. 

It's crazy me. expect see sub.  JnJ better vaccine month now. You’ll also less likely get serious side effects. difference chance dying hospitalized getting vaccinated practically rounding error, vaccines. Learn read. matter life death lot people, ""personal problems"".

In defense, really thought through. imagine massive pushback could happen. words, post lie going grasp straws anyway. I'm guessing also much urgency considering Australia normalcy past year half every rich country, aside maybe US. one gonna stop getting many vaccines want Course idea. live really crowded college town also drive see boyfriend city. gone clubs parties hung friends. safe, didn’t think I’d get covid vaccinated. I’m idiot. sad, would countries developed vaccine give away vaccinating themselves? would like see data Uganda building virology immunology centers, hoping someone else work them.  protect social distance .  go that. think that’s thing said 😂 already covid? natural immunity protect others around you? 


My brother get vaccinated says he's immune likely spread - can't find good evidence prove wrong... places say enough data. crazy? Bioterrorism? minor offence, any. Give fine (100€) already punish enough. almost like vaccines work something. understand you’re saying Anecdotes useful data.  shall see aren't. Hi everyone. PCR test detect virus symptoms gastrointestinal?  doubt it. two Israelis three opinions, legacy hold Ehh, available I'll get anyway  see offices opened going back full remote, though. 12 months since got vaccine WTH even vaccines year ago?! even debatable.

Your chances contracting dying covid much higher chances even encountering one side effects, much less dying one them. latter.

Young people 30 yet vaccinated, bars clubs re-opened soon No, definitely not. UK 95% vulnerable vaccinated seen CFR drop 0.2% - COVID vulnerable vaccinated far less likely lead serious illness death. India anecdotally claimed severity higher, consistent 1000x viral load (faster replication within body always cause severity). overall correct answer ""we know"". Nooooooooooo!!!!!! J&amp;J takers allowed go clubbing immediately shot without testing; that, cheating tests, fucked everything majorly.  jab, according studies, risk spreading decreased 60ish %.. apart agree. see reason vaccinate either. article says USA vaccinate children 18 16 anyway atm.. must've read wrong.

I wonder side effects vaccine could future. mean, believe works intended, wonder side effects might see/have 10/20/30 years etc. any..  two wrongs make right.    Yes, also important note chance experiencing side effect outrageously slim. Underrated comment top shelf stuff lol Beterschap Unvaccinated people going catch virus little half country remains unvaccinated.

This lane chose continue happen unless get vaccinated.

As someone vaccinated, concern level 0. know takes two weeks even see hospitalisation death figures? keep letting everyone clubbing hit 80.000 infections day realise happens death hospitalisation. Also, long covid _is_ thing points Hamilton! Nobody gave real shit flu... facilites Tunisia, Egypt, South Africa,...

Africa huge continent huge problems. plenty place progress innovation.

I also want point «unlikely west's tech level» trope said China 20 years ago. Okay original comment mentioned 60 percent protection false mentioned short term concerns....

Isreal society earth that's majority population vaccinated 6 months issue observed asymptomatic efficacy reduced.... mean vaccinations reducing hospitalization like said that's really care about.

Your countries population vaccinated completely separate issue... Also regarding booster shot, many countries already begun procuring them... Again, countries situation different hard make blanket statement... Nope. Dammit Joey, one job.... three free covid testing centres within 5 minutes walk front door. 

All 3 get tested 3 minutes. 

You definitely contact local government minister complaint this. unfair you, fact drive unfair environment too. wasn’t even potential, anyone brain cell skull rub saw coming. UK struggling issue WEEKS relaxing rules, *even* vaccination rates 3-4x Netherlands. It’s pure incompetence, I’m shocked anyone confidence gov whatsoever.  answer anything stated. sure multiple reasons belief come lab. basis solely, really sound convincing. knows. two doses AZ protection asymptomatic infection still basically around 50-60%, given ""natural"" R0 delta estimated around 8 so, long enough timeline everyone eventually infected sooner later.

Polio similar R0 managed eradicate vaccines 99% efficacy, context 50-60 really enough complete eradication. hopefully serious cases corona low matter. There's never vaccine long-term side effects. There's never severe viral disease without long-term side effects. choice two extremely easy.

You find UK data this: currently ~1 million people COVID symptoms month infection, ~0 people virus symptoms month dosing. extremely large risk ratio. Nooo thats arrhythmia, less caffeine (alot less) pepsi, coke, coffees. Get regular sleeping schedule. Eat less greasy foods, exercise develop stronger heart.

But honestly avoiding caffeine solve it, me. cause severe breathlessness (you cant breath) numbness see doctor. Oy, thanks mate Yep, stop spreading false information. Majority people die Coronavirus, “from” probably billion people caught delta now. incredibly contagious.  No.

But bars clubs re-opened belief could keep control testing everyone.

They made mess it, completely failed containing spread. damn fucked Netherlands variant come along vaccines aren’t effective.

This fear mongering. didn’t abomination couple weekends ago lol, ordered portable unit monday cause fuck sweating i’m chilling apt lol know someone got married November 2020, height second wave. People wearing masks, cut guest list down, still good wedding. wouldn’t worry one year. end day, it’s guys celebrating commitment anyway; party extra. get that, they're thinking they'd like booster hope they're working towards really think precautions aren’t place protect immunocompromised people? exist vaccine, know. aren’t aware protect immunocompromised people general, makes *you* negligent. much protection immunocompromised patients vaccine (that hasn’t approved FDA still trials American people).

Nah, election year. havent materialized. entire narrative around literally ""bro, like, imagine tho"" China likely able pull without extreme control citizen individual movements. Countries privilege individual freedom privacy simply access rely tracing systems inevitably gonna less effective accurate.

You absolutely right, China level control. obviously good thing explain they've managed keep control. I'm advocate it, I'm explaining people doubt China's current numbers, thinking must impossible, look actually happens China small outbreak. becomes lot believable see action.  Bad idea Cats bag point. Vaccines widely available choose get one it’s you. 

To choice clear, vaccines free. simple trip ER cost hundreds, overnight stay thousands multiple days literally bankrupt even financially stable people. sucks Western propaganda Chinese propaganda make seem worse really is. Especially stuff brain washing total control information. 

In reality similar countries. Stay away clubs bars. mostly 15 25 year old affected.

Hopefully wave start dropping bars clubs closed e-mail authors pre-print. available.  supposed go veins... I’m 12, would like know  OP height pandemic usually put mask walked front door took returned. live city even outside still encounter lot people. felt respectful thing neighbors. Also, found less messed it, easier get used forget even wearing it. Ignorance bliss  Australia cases, contact tracing tell us individual instances transmissibility Delta variant - see increased transmissibility Delta variant dire concern. Sydney, Australia, several people infected “fleeting” non-physical contact cafe shopping mall. CCTV footage revealed two people walking past mall transmitting virus. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters Sydney “We also need recognize Delta variant… actually gold medallist comes jumping one person another.""

A shopping mall ought well ventilated, similar conditions outdoors. Keep safe there. Everyone vaccinated last 6 months, think big problem yet. starts becoming problem, booster shots surely given. 

And yes, long covid pretty big thing. Bur hospitalisations deaths sadly even bigger thing disease (not terms numbers effect has). ""optimal"" measurable metric? Seems arbitrary. Let's say manufactured lab, surely difference humans limited time, resources, knowledge, versus virus hundreds millions infections. would benefits someone risk getting sick COVID? (Crickets)... imo disaster exactly mentioned reasons!  government decided coronavirus numbers loow, rookie numbers might even call wanted back high seriously look see pattern, whenever coronavirus cases lower become higher dumb ass reason government thinks impossible cases become higher they've gone soon cases go remove coronavirus measures lo behold cases go up, reimpose go remove etc etc, infinite cycle.

Now mask mandate gone ONE wearing mask anymore, absolutely one, I've supermarket seen single facemask yet, pathetic, takes little wear facemask yet people refuse dumb reason.  still well. DLCDC German here. experts recommend testing vaccinated people view also big portion yet vaccinated groups is, many people mild sickness suffering effects months later.

It's significant issue affect people may realize don’t think gyms going close  Technical briefing number 18 UK shows deaths 50 double vaccinated groups. course wonder long second shot was.

But way important imo, much viral load fully vaccinated body handle?? Like sitting room 8 hours open windows, adequate ventilation least one person spreading delta. fall tell us companies want personnel back office. Thank heaven I'm unemployed.  Long covid also matters, happens quite often affects person's life lot. hospitalisation ICU admission affects someone more, limited due hospital capacity. That's lots western countries managed waves based hospital capacity sadly. death affects someone contacts most. That's metrics receive focus. 

And spread transmissible variant also danger. saying risks matter, trying make point current wave infections yet disaster, due deaths hospitalisations still low.  Florida trip three weeks. outside/beach activities..... Still thinking bailing. Yup, cold recently I’m getting it. Wasn’t bad still lingering cough. pretty natural behavior viruses come back hard. recognize COVID threat children they’re vector spreading it. trials testing younger children going now. triaged trials prioritize vulnerable.

Date: April 23, 2021 effort evaluate COVID-19 vaccines even younger children moving forward. Inci Yildirim, MD, PhD, associate professor pediatrics (infectious diseases) Yale School Medicine, lead Yale’s component Moderna’s clinical trial vaccine children 6 months 12 years age. Called KidCOVE, phase 2/3 trial conducted approximately 90 sites across U.S. Canada include 6,750 children. 
 vaccinologist, says evidence suggests even beyond contribution herd immunity, vaccinating young children could protect health people assumed pandemic began. “As pandemic evolved learned many things didn’t know initially,” says Yildirim. “We learned fact children get infected develop severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions. seen children transmitting SARS-CoV-2 children adults summer camp family gatherings.” 
 also concern so-called “long COVID” may lasting recurring effects children themselves, Ogbuagu explains. “We know people long COVID symptoms even weren’t hospitalized symptoms persist longer typical illness,” says. yet another reason want young children vaccinated safely effectively.
Testing children’s vaccines complicated. 
 says trials children younger 12 far complicated adult trials like one Moderna investigator last year, take time complete. “A clinical trial children’s COVID-19 vaccine requires consideration many additional factors,” explains. “Children little adults. children grow develop, immune system grows develops. 16-month-old 16-year-old. children, capacity respond vaccines same.” 
 protocol Yildirim follow developed collaboration National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases Moderna. consists two parts: first, seeks determine safe dose antigen; second, test whether dose effective. called “age de-escalation/dose escalation” study. Participants placed three groups: 6 12 years old, 2 6 years old, 6 months 2 years old. God. live Deep South San Diego. Fully vaxxed, still masking. know it’s gonna get really nasty soon. :\ May ask side effects receiving vaccine? hope guys get well soon! long term effects would presented now, people vaccinated year long term effect stay dorment pop 10 years. amount people vaccinated 5-6 month would 100% already cases weird long term effects would made headlines lot major outlets. 

For example 2009 Sweden swineflu epidemic around 5 million vaccinated vaccine used (totally different vaccine, Pandemrix) long term effects people, got narcolepsy. thing is, got cause disease swineflu sometimes caused narcolepsy theory protein vaccine could trigged auto immune reponse body disease. (Out 5 million, 440 side effect, almost exclusively children teenagers)

Do know long Pandemrix vaccine people got long term side effect? Almost instantly getting vaccine. year, month, I'm talking days after. 

You fine, take vaccine make people around safer disease. No, reason approved 12 studies don’t data yet. risk/benefit analysis happens data actually available. Basically every side effect get vaccine also get COVID, much higher likelihood too. Blood clots, heart inflammation, super common COVID outcomes even people die vs. minuscule chance things vaccine isn’t even final form mean might looking boosters every 6 months? I’d that. could pretty damn useful. civil person.

That abundantly clear. mean, that's anecdotal evidence. Cool, statistics say?  Cost per dose depends vaccine, closer $40. real cost logistical costs due staffing personnel. vaccinated.

As far natural immunity lasting long, yet see reports naturally immune people losing immunity en masse nearly 2 years recovery, however seen talks needed booster shots vaccinated people, vaccination immunity fading even 6 months vaccine rollout. 

If evidence refute either points, please share them. mandates vaccines can’t protect one person

In fact, they've protected millions. Post stats then. made claim. It’s you. cost buck five. Definitely better nothing.

Unfortunately Novavax, despite AWESOME Covid-19 vaccine, uses technology religious right railed decades ago. simply used HPV vaccine, thought incentivizing promiscuity young women rather anti-cancer vaccine.

It's older, proven, non-replicating vaccine tech. Super safe, approved asap. one chance getting approved US time soon. false equivalencies glad understood. yours.

Thank reposting that. I’m civil person. members team work (including myself) working minimum 80 hour weeks managing services, safety, waste associated testing vaccines nationwide. tired, burnt out, depressed, working butts save population care. Get vaccinated, longer goes harder becomes us keep going likely variant emerges end games everyone.  get flu shot every year friends young children. I've never asked someone please get take precautions don't. 

You bet ass would gotten sweet shot Phyzer regardless giving cover resume normal activities, going celebrate benefits. Idk you’re talking about. I’ve gotten opposite impression place. sure would save vaccinated family lot money electric bill. Can’t one ridiculous conspiracy theory true? Wait, got vaccinated March think starts fading 6 months maybe true elders people chronic ilnesses What!? absolutely ask questions. That's ridiculous. problems mask love affair vaccinated people justifying effects. impact! Well don’t know took COVID test 20 times got vaccinated negative still felt like taking safety anyone involved agree everyone taking masks would’ve Oh, I'm saying get bad again, I'm saying there's reason concern. I'm saying I'm going place importance reddit user's social media anecdotes Center Disease Control. Exactly. That's refuse vaccine also refuse wear masks, refuse distance others, refuse get tested, refuse anything all. wanting told do. Stupid. Yay got something right Louisiana! Finally.  “Natural immunity” doesn’t last long vaccine

To knowledge, talk naturally immune individuals losing immunity en masse (despite many immunity nearly two years now), meanwhile already discussed, 6 months vaccine rollout, booster shots soon recommended required coming months due waning immunity vaccinations. provide studies show people natural immunity already shedding immunity en masse, would like see efficacy isn’t consistent.

Again, knowledge, reinfection among others previously recovered patients extremely rare, even accounts people tested positive zero symptoms illness. Hospitalization death rates reinfected low nil. However, breakthrough cases among vaccinated common CDC says recommending testing vaccinated UNLESS showing severe cases covid infections, true rate mild breakthrough cases unknown. since stress vaccines prevent infection transmission largely eliminate hospitalizations deaths infections, presume mild breakthrough cases rare.

Again, stats, would happy take look them. ScIeNcE wRoNg RiGhT Yes, submitting FDA fine normal. took issue announced it. suggested may needed now. BioNtech press said, continue believe likely, based totality data date, third dose may needed within 6 12 months full vaccination

Perhaps opinion sort public health message come FDA CDC. vaccine. 

If truly fearful vaccine would least take precautions. no, people refuse wear masks, refuse distance, refuse absolutely anything 

They purposefully knowingly whatever spread virus. Okay thanks look well Maybe. Skipping mask mandate 8% ppl vaccinated, way getting vaccines kinda counterintuitive full lockdown now. hey, country, problem. sorry that’s thing brain take away carry firearm everywhere go incase risk violent crime? must care then. (Same [redacted] extreme? Okay fire extinguisher everywhere go? Oh mean risk versus reward benefit isn’t signing blank checks random people internet going look you. know real world there?

Totally false equivalencies, nice try, guess. too! Wish could suspect they'll need smaller doses might mean longer studies. anyone done poll vax-hesitant people asked ""would take non-mRNA(old-school type) vaccine covid-19 available today?"" 

the first 'excuse' circle people non-vaxx'd BS mRNA/new/untested.

Would bad gov approved non-mRNA type vax (even though effective). 50%(?guessing) hesitant people would take it, better nothing? shit I’m making account view that, 42% (eligible not) outdated. Look vaccination dashboard here, straight county itself. Got second dose days ago, feeling great road full protection! got 1/3 figure several articles I've seen, [this WebMD going recent long covid studies. known cure long covid either, there's lot unknowns terms length severity illness, lot people still battling long covid symptoms year since infection...so risk long covid joke. kind point. able get treatment relief autoimmune condition, uncertainty exists long covid. anyone tell bad is. would Republicans get Trump made according them? 🤔 anti vaxxers refuse get vaccine.

It's also refuse ANYTHING place that. Refuse wear masks. Refuse distance. Refuse take precautions ever. 

So can't claim thing help combat covid. behavior criminal disgusting. honestly don’t get it. crowd wanted restrictions lifted tool that, reject it? It’s baffling. Thanks clearing misconceptions. Okay, got un-lazy looked relevant information. ""WEBMD NEWS BRIEF"" May 13, 2020 - Several countries relaxed shelter-in-place orders beginning shift back lockdown mode seeing spike coronavirus infections, according Washington Post. excerpts article. ""Late Tuesday, Saudi Arabia joined Lebanon South Korea re-imposing certain restrictions. country announced 24-hour curfew 5-day Eid Al-Fitr holiday marking end Ramadan May 23-27."" ""On Saturday, mayor Seoul, South Korea, pulled back reopening bars nightclubs dozens cases appeared. Sunday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said “brace pandemic’s second wave.” Everyone wants restrictions end, hopefully endangering vulnerable populations so. fully vaccinated people close contact fully vaccinated perfectly valid life choice tune life life free constant barrage ""news"".  I'm speech therapist public schools last year. used combination clear masks amplification mic placed inside mask. Worked great!  anyone know reduction transmissibility Chinese vaccines? I'm process getting Sinopharm curious much prevents virus hopping body someone else's. seems mRNA vaccines damn good job 85% reduction rates.

\*these numbers **very** hard find online unclear chumps going release data. Lmao 10 million small sample size mom 50 refuses get vaccine. Everytime tell get vaccine says, ""Well we'll see arm falls three years!"" got vaccine literally put magnet arm shocked stick. 

I've accepted fool, despite age fact know better. I've also made peace potentially losing next two years. did, negative, still stayed quarantined 2 weeks us it. free. anyone know transmission/travel rate nanochips mucous membrane vs bloodstream? important facts lot insane people need know. Yes. like schools chicken pox vaccines. Yet, unclear encourage government tell lies. it’s not. disagree 99% Reddit’s echo chamber. post doesn’t mean agree shit. Nice try, though. hear? mask mandates community transmission made sense. waiting days put place several cases extremely reckless. obvious. people go work person live smaller apartments close worse outcomes. Need time see vaccinations keep delta 1. Restrictions contact tracing seem holding well delta. people ignorant disrespectful legit people side effects. problem really people go places complain problem glowing review. Potential unpopular opinion: know what? Fuck people. I’m tired caring people can’t even assed pretend care anyone else (and even questionable)

The regret people can’t legitimately get vaccine want going directly affected    CDC says yes, yes still get vaccinated explain Cleveland study everyone flipping **still pre-print peer reviewed yet**. 

Plus research also explains there’s actual downside people getting vaccinated getting it. It’s another layer protection - especially variants. There’s even research reviewed seeing people struggle long COVID symptoms massively decrease thanks getting vaccinated. It’s free readily available, wouldn’t someone get **outside PCP saying shouldn’t get it**? enjoyed leadership covid crisis top would done much better. President could see things thru prism affected personally decided big crisis would hurt re-election chances. downplayed covid, mocked preventative measures provided wrong information. 

The funny thing that, Trump shown true leader ship, tens thousands fewer would died surely would re-elected. extreme ignorance narcissism made impossible. think 100% amongst mice tried on. course different thing human trial. Facts get refund? I'm getting 5G service put phone near shoulder. vaccine customer service department? already good data phase III trial participants? vaccinated almost year ago. quick use Australia example see happens NSW. starting see rise cases looks slowly spiralling control (for us spent majority past 18 months low/zero covid) could end worse first serious spike Melbourne. low vaccination rates country wide due incompetent leadership.  Yes no. Politics made worse. clearly countries government aren’t keep contained either. could controlled like Ebola, probably not, 600k people didn’t die either. “Natural immunity” doesn’t last long vaccine efficacy isn’t consistent. thought it, huh?  China Vaccinated Missouri since February. ashamed people ignoring seriousness this. free will, wish people less prideful, thoughtful everyone else. That's nice country opening vaccines people 18+ (it used 55+) mother got sinovac vaccine im assuming get one real, would basically forever people got decide everyone. Haha I’m literally never wearing mask again, thanks horrible pessimism guess.  Yeah surprise ... thought people got vaccine? reason wear mask...? I'm confused. people understand we're things? Sorry Reddit wouldn’t allow respond way wanted too. I’ll try this.

I’m sorry that’s thing take away conversation. Bless heart Thanks thoughtful feedback. So, though, make vaccine mandatory (who get it) away masks people (children teachers) CDC suggests? way people wearing masks kids 12 (for now) teachers would wearing masks lessening verbalization (and other) issue. Schools require vaccines attendance. check. Vaccination needs answer. masks, solution. Border closures stuck home years now. news reports Florida cases. see every day. Data trackers stories don’t add new information allowed. Found rural American. burden proof show Ivermectin effective. got sick get vaccine. Consequences bummer. 100% Idiocracy. Move Comedy category Documentaries.  Pretty sure guy's never actually read Bible. heard nobody side affects day two. Saying side affects 1-2 days spreading misinformation claimed. Maybe that's vaccine both. I'd also take week mild side affect alternative. statement puts ""don't get it"" vibe.  Good grief. would reason end MO, note self end man’s healthcare network.  always assumed dumbest people zombie movies unrealistic poor writing. Shows know.  would lock world long time it. already starvation crisis happening poor nations. 1) astronomers work mountaintops there's light. Virus researchers work there's emerging viruses. 
2) viruses studied emerging cities. Like astronomers, study are. 
3) totally sure sharing samples. definitely sharing sequences. Moving actual viruses around think fairly rare could wrong. 

I mean start remote virus lab middle nowhere far away universities, virus populations researchers. Personally I'm ok smart people working secure highly controlled environments best understand viruses treatments available inevitably emerge. trying re-write history. bother wasting anymore time responding again.  We'll, going use them, give people will. People wear cloth faces help others. supposed pretend like people would allow foreign substance inside bodies help others?   OK, crazy. Serious side effects vaccine minimal. Serious side effects COVID anything but. heard this? Memories way short. Bubba Watson, fully vaccinated, passed entry covid test, says participate Open Championship exposed someone positive. Interesting. Unless vaccine mandatory. pretty good idea, think. That's bad. mad CA gov't pushing schools reopen two months go year, even added funding protections, felt like happening fight recall Governor Newsom, can't imagine upset I'd kid teachers thrown wolves without mask mandate. Stay safe!! worry, ""invisible hand"" capitalism sort out, right guys? Yacht sales exploded COVID. Don’t forget cognitive psychological issues showing longhaul COVID folks. dying doesn’t necessarily mean living awful consequences it. know else cause heart inflammation? Covid.  Appreciate supporting eradication. However much want happen possible. virus extremely widespread along transmissible variants. would need intense global cooperation want get rid virus think happen unfortunately. Eventually like flu stay background. Pandemics last forever. definitely eye opening 

and sad work though possible get virus body eyes?  means working. fever 2 days.  People need suck part, plus better dying covid. feeling happened. Vaccines pretty hard find March/April. Given could long 1 month doses, found really odd everyone pretending fully vaccinated CDC issued reckless abandonment masks. 

Also, blue/purple state, Colorado continued less stellar numbers. stop governor declaring victory pandemic ahead All-Star Game. *sigh*  clear expert, heard TV-experts done reading might wane time entire immunological response.

There types cells attack viruses vaccines seem stimulate response supposedly last many years.

The best tell immediate neutralizing immune response might wane, example come contact COVID-19, might get sick rest immune system orchestrates response knocks out, understanding patient would experience like cold COVID-19 known date.  Mitigation. said, masks still required. many hospitalizations? assume vent numbers high ones hospital people REALLY sick, sick + preexisting conditions causes need hospital. understand mean drag greater efficiency filtering droplets size we're interested in. Probably around SARS-CoV-2 variant.

[Relevant people need hear going listen CNN Thank you!  Totally. hope too. think will. must suck meantime. Interesting shit. Pun intended 😎 mean, kids died. We’re impression children died COVID? mean ask there’s data showing (or equally) dangerous children adults? would helpful clarified question. 

There’s data showing kids efficient disease vectors, even don’t get super sick die, they’re likely infecting people around higher rate. 

The delta lambda variants new research passed peer review yet. preliminary data show higher infection rate severity among healthy, younger patients previous variants. technology detect infections measuring electromagnetic waves, change RNA particles virus present body, ? real virus super power vaccine ? That's mouse human mask. Wish could say surprised doctor wasn’t encouraging vaccine. pulmonologist (lung doctor) discouraged masks advertises symptomatic people come office testing. 

Don't believe words, seriously. Theres much disinformation there. Look organization found. Seriously, urge to. listen inventor mrna vaccine said.

I'm tinfoil hat kinda guy. stay far away conspiracy sites. holy shit. stuff vaccines rolled absolutely crazy much still hard time grappling it. really think getting vaccine care? lot anti-vaxxers really projecting fears needles onto vaccine. see good uptake. blame media non-stop attempts garner attention using images footage needles injections. Communications experts continued warn they’re generating resistance.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Matt 4:7 Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must test Lord God.’

The bible tells idiot doing. There's name attacking argument someone make, falsely attributing statements them. work people similar reaction 2nd dose. One brothers zero energy, concentrate body ached. lucky got whelp 2nd shot arm sore bit. Makes worry parents :( freaking hate virus get can't transmit it. first number 100% second matter.

This problem well known. Early phase trials shown intramuscular vaccines can't really block upper respiratory tract infection. 

This way virus takes hold. Second stage moves lungs. Blocking pneumonia phase considered good enough, already considering nasal vaccines, blocking URT infection reliably would silver bullet. face huge wave delta variant offered JnJ vaccine instead waiting pfizer month bit. JNJ good?  DoNt KnOw LoNgTeRm SiDe EfFeCtS vaccine. 

But know one COVIDs permanent long term side effect, death. 

Get vaccinated people. Sounds like woke morning initially read get shot immediately seem strange Unless one idiots believes ""vaccine shedding"". Mine too! want mask free need show vaccinated. thoughts:

1. there's many fields 'smart' people need work remote areas. Like astronomers example work remote mountain tops.  I'm saying EVERY lab super remote, putting downtown best either.

2. know emerging diseases, thought things like catch bats wild test viruses. idea bringing wildlife/virus city labs makes sense.

3. im impression share 'samples' labs across world would risk.

even covid (or similar future) 0.1% chance escaping lab. think treat like 'worst case sceario' make types labs 'remote'. Vaccines help everyone, many /r/covidlonghaulers still left suffering year. Thanks hope we're gonna get better  I’m NC. opened person fall. improved ventilation, distancing lower grades minimal distancing upper grades, vaccines. Teachers expected shut deal. least mask mandate. states southeast didn’t even that. I'm blaming people believe vaccine puts tracker government get us.

Do think previous U.S. President fed mentality? “Show state papers can’t come in”?  ignorant believe vaccines developed 1 place alone. Even 1st step Pfizer's vaccine manufacturing starts USA.

At start pandemic well reported Pfizer depended specialised lipids wait it... UK.

Moderna plant Switzerland sources Europe 

Stop pointing fingers countries blame accept global effort. claim people reporting negative experiences fake never got shot? authoritarianism sucks. Let free market decide impose vaccine rules businesses deem profitable. Nobody ever forced injection. okay concerns, sure. people need look rather listening fearmongering grifter.

I exactly call Dr. Malone ""fearmongering grifter"", invented mRNA technology. said ""I think benefits outweigh risks cohort"" 18-22 year olds, lamented ""risk-benefit analysis done"", agree points looking myself.

The science surrounding pandemic become incredibly politicized, many voices going narrative silenced, West well China. little faith public health authorities saying, especially people like Anthony Fauci Susan Michie, appear nothing COVID grifters. If, hysteria politics over, vaccine appears safe, likely take it, can't certain enough decision take it, every attempt encourage authorities (vax passes, rewards, etc.) reinforces belief something off. believe sceptics boat. guarantee call bullshit that

No. believe probably friend works Pfizer, put much weight it.  Incoming great new content /r/publicfreakout fall.   cousin recently unvaccinated friend die covid. man’s family still refuses get vaccinated. It’s unbelievable. able get vaccinated (meaning healthy enough live area access vaccines,) choose get vaccinated, whatever happens fault sympathy you. breaks go car, breaks absolutely nothing?

Common dude, become anti-vaxx seeing one situation immune system hold up, already anti-vaxx looking excuse. wait hear flu shots! Round 2? - _- Oh well. I'm pretty much sympathy choose get vaccinated. They're putting everybody else risk due selfishness, especially can't get vaccinated physical reasons. Upper management case Mayor Bill de Blasio, state funded upgrades air filtration systems back Feb March public schools could re-open in-person instruction end March. Now, can't prove every school used funding instructed, know kid's school did. Every classroom got HEPA filters installed every air vent bi-weekly filter cleanings. 6.4% partially vaccinated 8.5% fully Hey there, Delta Eh, ignores *massive* key difference: last measurement, antibodies variants trending really quite significantly since trials. Like, antibodies Beta, variant basically stunted trial South Africa went 13x reduction 3x reduction 8 months: good, J&amp;J’s ability increase time outstanding.  Oh god…that’s horrible!! Ah shit, go Yes research, incidents long COVID-19 confined one age bracket common whole swaths people laid low. Okay buddy show stats. Show officially states healthy young people dying rate unhealthy people. Please show me. 

Why would someone able get vaccine?

Im forced anything think be. Lol

Your argument transmission virus still bring back pandemic bad health, flu virus.

See? trying convince thing help you. NOPE. know actually know help me. telling pepe getting injection reddit forum presented credentials all? That's pretty creepy    It’s certainly case everybody catches delta variant without benefit vaccine always dies. It’s hard figure fatality rates different variants variants changing prevalence people’s behavior also changing it’s likely much similar previous variants 100% plenty comfortable masks. probably won’t traveling plane you’re waiting masks go away. 12 hospital admissions. don’t get it. feel like less deadly. ""Please ship covid patients Seattle Portland."" Thanks haha behavioral trait animals nervous systems. Conditioning always effective time proximity minimized. improved reception Microsoft Surface tablet, course!

Just waiting relaunch Windows Mobile OS. two adjacent states highly infected Delta Oklahoma lucky two weeks ago cases rose significantly. Basically everywhere except East-Asia. ...................... live NC. almost whole life. know NC, speak whole state like am. Nobody call cops people wearing masks.   That's fair point, seems extreme reimpose masks etc. small number positive cases. going completely fine hard say...

AstraZeneca proven poorer single dose results pretty much everywhere use non-human adenovirus. Sputnik V uses twice many vector viruses proline substitutions. Chinese vaccine designers publish results sense priority.  Thanks Euro 2020! also Google find plenty stories report undercounting.

But know what? want explain getting.

We statistics turns things stay pretty consistent. Yes factors change overall stay pretty much least 5 year time-frame.

When talk excess deaths, July normally 100k people die, sure average 100k +/- 5k 95k 105k, suddenly covid 110k 2k deaths reported due covid...

It take rocket surgeon figure out. estimate overall deaths caused covid double, reported even India showing death counts undercounted factor 6 last wave weeks.

Yes 4k dying, 20k day period time excess deaths wave.

The reports US exist bad, like 70% higher. Canada country announced nearly 100% factor two.

Russia admitted early deaths undercounted factor 3. 5 months ago. also admitted again.

So dunno that's top head remembering.

Even places counted, aptly admitting overcounting ones counted may wrong.

Aka 4k excess deaths.

2k labeled covid find 400 covid.

Well turns 2k covid, 4k covid likely 3.6k makes sense. weird conspiracy (is redundant?) theory population control vaccine. Someone tried use screaming would never get vaccinated. Since absolutely logic said, stopped listening. speaking now. point feel sick, wear mask, everyone else always wearing them.

Masks work preventing spreading droplets touching face. Nah. hands idiot politicians. Masks proof vaccine indoor functions implement reopening. dropping everything absolutely ridiculous. seems like immunity wanes six months. also common coronaviruses.  Even Pfizer moderna ?  Logarithmic axis appropriate choice graph. change 1 10 concerning change 10 100. see it, happen! happens vaccine, still infections. know couple took Pfizer lost taste, smell fever. long serious, think vaccine job. Actually isn't. Colds mostly rhinoviruses adenoviruses others. Coronaviruses like 20% yearly colds. feel like mixing possibility probability falsification, good hypothesis requires former latter.

I feel like mixing fantasy realism. Anything imaginative possibility. example, came proving Higgs boson existed physicists accepted .00001% margin error. nearly impossible wrong existence outside realm possibility.

At point time responsible scientist recognizes odds moves life something useful productive. That's feeling whole ""where covid come from?"" debate. appears obsession actual scientific pursuit knowledge.  Block too. dust sandals anti-vax luddites. Eh, is, benefit small.

As vaccinated person, chances contracting transmitting covid another person small. mask on, chance even smaller.

That said, wear mask anymore places. Girl truly lord's work. said vaccine numbers people 20s 30s dont shock someone dating men 20s 30s now. arent antivaxx anti anything unless forced to/someone actual work them. 


But others said, red flag. Get boy shot run. North Carolina hindsight hospitals seem like place masks absolutely mandatory, covid not. definitely, percent ICU patients ventilators alarming. think 88 percent counted day. saw last year. usually around 40 50 percent ICU patients ventilators.

It's interesting number vents much higher. Real world results ways J&amp;J. supplied heavily countries robust public health systems. supply ended US donated countries can't source directly due budget constrained public health care systems.  “Healthy young people” fall victim long Covid unhealthy young people. statement didn’t prove anything different. “Healthy young people” still carry transmit COVID, even don’t get hospitalized die due it. “Healthy young people” still lose smell taste 6+ months due getting COVID. “Healthy young people” still unhealthy and/or old relatives, friends, acquaintances may able get vaccine may susceptible breakthrough infections.

You ignore facts twist narrative young people “forced” things. reality, force you’re feeling conscience you’ve smothered shoved corner deep brain. It’s begging stop illogically fighting reasonable thing, favor completely reasonable thing actually helps around may never encounter rest life. keep pressing back, it’s clearly gonna go quietly. Im glad covid moderately bad. bc recovered w long haul. im fully pfizer vaxxed concern covid anymore friends / fam around Plus Flu Season. sick yet year touch wood. Seems escaped office. Managers flexible WFH people sick think helped lot. way know body react virus?

I friend got flu like symptoms days tested posited month. Another friend got sick really bad. wife crying might die. said ignoring news? read everywhere else. It’s still sensationalism. Here's hint. Preprint here: listed first page. E-mails easily googled.

You may want see section titled ""Evidence genomic structure ongoing evolution SARS-CoV-2"" previous paragraph starting ""A specific laboratory escape scenario involves accidental infection  course  serial passage SARSr-CoV common laboratory animals mice.""

Would glad know think question. teh side, must know.... Get vaxed idiot! Well balls summer, think they'll call shut whole thing winter again. Cry don’t you, never accused anything. responded comment. you’re gonna play devil’s advocate someone else’s comment. point same, states populations reluctant get vaccinated going outbreaks, simple that. flu shot much waning immunity much constant mutations flu viruses.

Some vaccines wane time, don't.  I’m talking situation specifically haven’t reported it. haven’t seen data support concerns regard. you? supposedly 'you guys?' Overall USA 48% vaccinated I'm somewhat rural area people conservative leaning therefore empathy, borderline narcissistic, think virus can't hurt them. There's literal wildlife market city exotic animals stacked top other, slaughtered right wild animal guts blood place. 

Wild animal markets China extremely common. continues likely way spread, also continues primary risk future pandemic well. going another one within 50 years less wildlife markets stopped globally. That's SARS spread China. MERS similarly spread animals. ebola spread. going ""interesting coincidence"" angle would focus wildlife kept together sold country. massive problem.

The lab leak conspiracy theorists want something froth over. never biggest coincidence. put anything perspective, since comparing **officially reported** covid deaths **estimated** Spanish flu deaths. Estimated covid deaths 6-13 million far. 100 million figure Spanish flu suggested lone study expert tend question, estimates range 20 50 million. Omg Hahahahaahhahahahahha Hahahaha Great!!! can’t wait see results pediatric trials. Hahahahahahhaha Netherlands 72% adults already (partially) vaccinated. province live Canada lifted restrictions today scared say stupid, said wrote stupid, even gave benefit doubt presumed stroke. Uh oh Vitamin deficiency strong effect immune system vitamin deficiency common Winter thought one got banned Oh look. person instead facing consequences actions talking people instead just.....steals 1K fellow redditor.

Cool.  doctors died Covid since Christmas fully vaccinated

The vaccination rate among health workers Indonesia 90-95%. 75% deaths among unvaccinated, vaccine's efficacy vs COVID-related deaths around 96-97% great.

That said, Indonesia going next India July-August 5% fully vaccinated population abysmal. really understand wtf Indonesian government time, especially saw horror unfolding India. Oh shit go think mean party since hold power Florida would need hold accountable. Nobody could seen coming, except everyone.  good job host huge global sporting eve... oh wait. gotta put Busch Mt Dew shot itself. It’s stupid enough work people Heart inflammation one lasting side effects virus. Along blood clots potential cause life long complications.

Seems kind silly compare symptoms death ignoring symptoms survive. FUCKIN CHIPS MAN. THATS SHORTAGE.

😂😂😂😂 Oh my. Good one. leopards eating face? Dr. Li Meng Yan

(Does anyone remember virologist? happened her?) Basically restrictions dropped youngest adults yet opportunity get first vaccine. also need tested enter certain locations disco, testing also significantly went among age category. course contagious delta variant. Puts $VACC poor vaccination rate. Masks works 100%. bad bad. Wake fuck Inconvenience people getting vaccinated. Maybe dump gets jab move onto anti-vaxxer. benefitting humanity charms 👍 positivity rate skyrocketed 3% 15%. testing they’re European it’s like New Yorker going New Jersey. Maybe it’s great idea it’s exactly trekking around world. misleading. biggest issue vaccines there's true available data sets continuous reporting. 

There's medicine world small amount side effect  thoughts found beginning element Kendrick Lamar. Right says happens Earth stays Earth prayers already answered vaccine.

They've abdicated faith   one ever mention Mexico? 😂  No, Delta variant importantly re-opening clubs bars. Party time! got back April, got positive COVID test yesterday Goodbye Zandvoort GP Delta low K factor (dispersion factor) superspreading opportunities largely unvaccinated cohorts problem. Nightclubs really bad news. Maybe trying severely cut carbon footprint. Veganism achieves this. anti-vax effective way indirectly kill many people reduce carbon footprints well. Young people lining pockets goverment. kinda easy take lobbying money large investors claim things young people. coming goverment approved useless tax payer funded 'fieldlabs' give money entertainment industry. I'm sure theres plenty ""low risk"" younger people Miss catch variant...are also advising see children grand children? 

They know simple answer is, want spend effort telling people get damn vax, political. problem strategy isn’t risk young people, it’s risk problematic mutation brewing young people let become petri dishes. Kind like India ok strategy ignoring strategy backfired horribly letting virus get access billion people experiment leads infectious variants. Romania 30% population vaccinated two doses reached line one wants it, that's sell them

Wow, vaccine hesitancy high Romania? I'm Florida man now. That's tad unexpected  Postponed November 2020 wedding May 2021 became obvious last year chance hell happening last fall.

Postponed May 2021 wedding January 2021 US vaccine rollout slow wanted people months returning normalcy big things like traveling state getting vaccinated.

Now I’m terrified people (namely, Future MIL FIL) gonna drop October 2021 wedding last minute. FIL vaccinated immunocompromised doubt he’ll ever able travel fun things ease worry-free ever again. said coming week told they’re mildly concerned variants gonna cause another lockdown…. US. kidding me? US barely ever locked begin with. tell heads at. can’t tell annoying/unnecessarily paranoid fuck, maybe they’re right. Maybe never right time wedding COVID isn’t going anywhere. from, common cold diagnosed “Covid”, really lot bullshit. rates among young low assume?

They barely legible first shot, yeah, rates low.  You’re looking “now” sir. Everything happens happening now. rise cases almost completely young people aged 15 30. lead huge number hospitalizations deaths.

Still 20 fold increase like 11 days... 1 vaccinated person per one million people given vaccinated population 1 vaccinated person per one million exposed people. data support latter. It’s people judgement, it’s basing strategy horny teens. someone forget inform virus done it? It’s Verstappens fault I'm hungry. Grilled cheese is!   I'm vaccinated everyone family. could waited two months untill people two shots.

Buy cases dropping loads people felt party time.

After people vaccinated, big re-open eventually hapoen.

The anti-vaxxers yet aware what's coming. likely get ill eventually, per official scientific advice OMT Dutch government July 2nd. I’m expert this, depends antibodies test looking for. look anti-spike antibodies, would likely come positive result vaccine.

A positive result test looks antibodies parts virus would indication covid before.

Perhaps info somewhere else whatever paperwork got could ask whoever conducted test?

I’m unsure abnormal thing means. report weekly. People already cautious likely fully vaxed cases. say time move on. Let anti-vax idiots get sick. Keep kids safe get vax approved &lt;12 group. would work Netherlands well. lived there, people would leaving clubs 5 am.

Something really corona vaccine protect almost severe Covid symptoms. smell taste hopefully return. vaccine never stop getting it, drop R0 1 circumstances would hopefully mean virus eventually goes away. got Delta variant. scary number Let respond bit points. understand fear new vaccin, but:

There half billion infections around world. number vaccins two three times that, far billion now.

Number people died virus 4 million officially, 0.8%. number people died due side effects vaccins maybe 100.

The vaccins tested since roughly year ago. virus known 1.5 years.

All vaccin much much safer.

But correct side effects real quite people. also known several people ill day two.

Then know least two people died virus, including 40 year old father two kids


So vaccin far safer choice.

You right make choice. country least nobody force you. still respect say no.

Sorry long rant :-)

I wish good health years ahead. England here, government decided stop everything 19 July go back normal. I’m sure what’s point even getting tested anymore. they’re going open everything stop mask mandate bother testing everyone. Thank Scotty Marketing new add!

By 'they' mean 'the government' (and latter phrase singular).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Your punctuation capitalisation could use work.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also: article suggest somewhat, one distinguish government Victoria New South Wales, distinguish federal Australian government. third world country first world suit, stolen second hand store. suspect depends LOT mask type quality. doctors spent significant time small space known infected infected doctors usually n95s eye protection. would good know effective surgical even cloth masks cases - suspect they’d still help lot mostly prevent aerosols entering rest rooms air (moreso filtering others aerosols air breathe in)  was, work uab lol Among things, it’s study ends current variant appears worse children transmissible became prevalent. People also don’t really enjoy downplaying risks coming along infection looking purely chance death. Based kid hospitalized, severely ill, gets long term damage, they’re fine - pointing death rates makes binary “you’re fine” “you’re dead” population everywhere culling itself. reports record high daily COVID-19 deaths, 25,000 new cases

That correct, sir. 'joined' Crimea effectively lost Ukraine forever ever. 1. supposed representative age distribution (not necessarily people joining trial, account post-processing data). Population density? sure matters. else ""everything""?
2. level exposure different matter? long equal placebo group vaccine group... 
3. guess could skew results somewhat, although doubt would drastic.
4. far valid point, Sinovac tested Brazil. tested 5 different countries.

The fact uncertainties exist make something ""scientifically meaningless"". truly so, approved vaccines based trial.  Exactly would ""full blown explosion"" here? natural immunity vaccinations, many people left infected. used say... shit Sherlock. Saying make difference year ago going make difference now.

Fwiw, work asking everyone who's vaccinated send HR copy vaccination record. They've also asked send card vaccinated wear mask. Haha. Curious see enforced.  🎵Here go again! ole shit again!!!!!!!🎵 Considering healthcare workers exposed huge amount Covid 19 viral load, 600 infection 600 thousand vaccinated pretty good least hindsight although need actual study Sinovac Delta.

I think enough make conclusions either way. way many factors affecting spread. one hand health care workers come contact sick people, also know protecting may cautious. tons factors well.

That serious vaccine study control groups account factors - removes tons uncertainty. Well, could sworn I’d bookmarked it, apparently didn’t. I’ll let know dig again. Bad bot. wasnt uncivil anyone lmao speaking general. Smfh nonsense. mutates much, yes. evolution mutation+natural selection. Natural selection virus's ability spread.

So produce many mutations can't spread (and never found sequenced), ones spread definition ones mutated beneficial way.  point teacher, requiring masks mean kids school LONGER. mean, hell lot less kids coming communicable illnesses like minor coronaviruses, colds, flus, gastro, etc. get sick least turn kids sent school, unmasked, parents home.  Could please fact based?

1: several Chinese vaccines, choose declare ineffivient.

2: studies shows vaccines (Sinopharm, Coronavac) effective - less mRNA, J&amp;J range perhaps. 

Effective vaccine 60% prevents symptoms prevent deaths. got spoiled unusual high effectiveness mRNA doesnt mean nothiog else works.  say that! Florissant here, dumb shit continues become prevalent. vaccine give full immunity either, still get carry it, affect bad. Like flu shot  I’m stunned crews aren’t fully vaccinated. Wondering passengers knew booked. moved long ago kind wondering point. Maybe I’m good general seems like difficult culture navigate rules everyone much minds business. It’s actually really nice way makes hard know assimilation going. restrictions unvaccinated, advice? thought advice.

Also, goal herd immunity. states close that, don’t. states do, main problem (overwhelmed health care system) almost completely solved, getting better every week. people false negatives early exposure actually shedding virus?
I heard test significantly accurate (much lower false negative rate) time person contagious. UK drop everything 19th July, fucked government calling “Freedom Day”. We’re fucked anti-maskholes

I'm adding vocabulary. Thank kind redditor. think people need think best. Nobody control others know multiple people died it, young healthy.

Then statistic anomaly try lottery. Also, adults work schools aren’t always able receive vaccine one reason another. 

In district, ironically school nurse particularly risk. Growing mom teacher, wife teacher, now. kids wearing masks, first winter remember *I* didn’t get sick something. Last read still mandating face masks indoors UK even 19 July. vaccination appointments dished automatically app tells show get jabbed

I see. Thank clarifying, completely agree best vaccine one get earliest.  think Pandemic would bad made political? not? Parts be. :( scientific research you’re referencing incomplete. side effect noticed vaccine went market, groups tested small percentage. assumed would case general population we’re seeing it’s common especially younger people. don’t data yet. going take years accurate data people storm capitols plot kidnap governors. clarify peanut gallery, AAVE?  I’m that. I’d take authentic Chinese vaccines plus mask nothing day. Hating Chinese political/social reasons nothing whether technology works not. seem work pretty well.

They’ll real vaccines proper provenance. 🧢 🧢 🧢 SARS2: Director's Strain  got vaccinated Canada, 15 minute waiting period leaving adverse reactions could caught, one expected (or allowed to) take mask off. metric see true situation hospitalisations low too. vaccine safe effective easy way everything widely adopted.

Ah fuck things take account: number positive tests doubling every two days week straight current countermeasures ridiculous. percentage positive tests increased five-fold far. People infected appear test numbers week. People test positive appear hospitals week soonest. take longer younger people, stay hospital longer. positive young people infect people age groups, take even longer see effect that. Vaccines prevent majority definitely hospitalizations. long COVID. variants.

As human hurts people fail see basic mechanisms pandemic even year daily exposure relevant information. got second dose April side effect public knowledge. Unfortunately, lot Reddit users another thread made doubt (some even sent mean pms) told anxiety. go hospital have. Based symptoms, doctor feels clear case myocarditis (I heart palpitations never before, breath easily, etc). wrote side effects chart. symptoms gone away time passes vaccine. I'm debating science. CDC lied us prevent mask shortage getting worse. trust anymore. actually discussion exact thing. They're saying second shot either Phiser Moderna. follow enough find outcome. People fucking worst. What? elderly first get America; well vaccinated remain so. Yeah, that's shitty clickbait title. Yeah totally. Smart entertaining people. I've learned little virology osmosis. 

Sorry long covid. Vaccine help? sucks. Hope feel better.  Thanks perspective.  UK small export vaccines around world town Belgium biggest manufacturer Pfizer vaccine outside US ignored ? remind long term effects covid, including death? glad friends page vaccines covid example, baseball teams certainly need masks basketball hard say. I'm reading I'm saying lab leak stuff appears totally bogus spread people understand it. Special needs aside, anyone know sure masks absolutely effect schooling process (including emotionally kids)? generally support masks beneficial asking people think critically really investigate issue sides rather writing masks big deal. think we’re far along vaccinations soon enough start looking deaths/hospitalizations instead infections. 

US/UK mad new cases deaths still going down. US seen 59% increase cases -29% decrease deaths last two weeks. UK doesn’t seem change deaths even though middle third wave since june.

We lock again, mess economy soon borders open, cases. Constant testing, closed borders quarantines long term solution.

Europe still needs month two don’t see point another lockdown. virus going go away, important thing need avoid deaths vaccines seem capable preventing those. 

I don’t mean sound like don’t care cause do, situation different year ago. safer responsible take vaccine that's readily available vaccine around yet.

Not everybody luxury choice. many folks claim follow dude said ""Love neighbor."" No, many countries shown possible vaccinate population, eliminate virus locally live life normally foreign case breaks through. it’s quick 1-2 week quarantine response everything goes back normal again.

Eventually countries virus also eliminate world free threats posed future variants. Weak link chain. got incentive enforce anything, managers give even everyone knows right thing do.

Unless really don’t trust doctors nothing truly provable. like said research act accordingly. comment surprisingly reasonable many others (on social media least) thinking need revert levels restrictions, everywhere, fall. Yes, vaccination rates better, even 50% cutting huge swath potential patients out. got 4 year old lung issues myself. added benefit protecting everyone else. hinders right now? That's discouraging. deep roots Colorado, although live presently. Coloradans tend better educated healthier almost state. high population along Front Range also tends Democratic/liberal, plains Western Slope opposite. 

It would interesting know 200,000 live. know ppl like harp partisan gap real race gap well. state like Mississippi low vacination due both.

There work done fronts People frustrated, directed frustration you. well, keep it, friend. makes feel better. Thank you. Even number cases increasing, hospital admissions low numbers. link infections hospital admissions broken, like UK. likely reason high vaccination rate. Canada, low Pfizer shipments, health ministry (NACI think) recommended people mixing 2 mRNA vaccines safe effective. Many people mixed Pfizer first dose Moderna second dose vice versa. doses (same vaxx), plus two weeks. 

Just max get available. Repost consequences people’s choice get vaccinated?

This reported June said Sinovac CEO think. sure formal study published. Phase 3 trials started July 27 last year enrolled 40,000 people. Unless see big uptick infections group, immunity last longer still protected. world us advanced country,  really think could move one 22 states higher vax rates according NYT. Dutch. 100% confirm sentiment. even say myself. Local government hands schools, like painfully so.

Even areas schools major reason property values local guys aren’t try help schools. Yeah tried strategy masks didn’t care still didn’t care. enough data yet. Time tell 3 months. January April people 6 months out. 

I got Jab Christmas eve. Getting parents mobilize get things done.

From building playgrounds getting new books, getting classrooms outfitted tech.

This extension that, it’s I’ve gone kids get things moving. preschool+kindergarten age kids masked school/camp/childcare many hours day time since June 2020. pretty chill whole time, still occasionally go grab put masks dressing ninjas etc home, think ok it. mask breaks lunch snacks small group outdoor play. I’m wrong I’m wrong. don’t need validation Suppose intention vaccinate everyone outbreak completed . would recommend? Remember country little naturally acquired immunity vast distances population centres.

Who ""they"" locked 18 months already? OP, also taught masked year. part, didn’t real outbreaks linked school (but live rural, red community mantra test kids, regardless). However, go virtual two weeks didn’t enough staff subs cover absent staff Thanksgiving break. many us quarantined due exposure actually Covid couldn’t realistically operate school person. would absolutely precedented.

Whatever doing, obviously got handle early stayed top extremely well since. Appalachia? Depends vaccine. Flu annual flu changes fast. You’re still immune flu 20 years ago, flu might exist anymore, replaced different one. Flu mutation champion. 

Measles almost never changes, enough escape MMR small child. one life. 

Bacterial vaccines like tetanus somewhere middle. 5-10 years. 

Barring flu-like radical changes, Covid leaning toward measles side. People survived SARS 1 17 years ago still good immunity SARS 1, lot virologists think SARS 2 probably can’t mutate enough escape vaccines without destroying itself, now, you’re vaccinated, assume you’re good hear otherwise someone doesn’t stand make billions saying you’re not. at? I'm sitting Belgium immigrant everytime Netherlands impressed infrastructure, bluntness people, pretty much anything. Loved it. way guys handled pandemic, wtf...

Good luck. wish full recovery 🙏 expect boosters happen? freedom affects ability get treated hospital real injury Ha Correct. Hi five Poland, (I may mistaken I've read we're) country excessive deaths pandemic :P okay! God hope timeline covid mutates become useless virus. finished Stand would much prefer remain fantasy. Actually, UK currently 3 vaccines - Pfizer, Oxford/AZ, Moderna. 

And official stance is...

""For example, pregnant 40 usually offered appointments Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines."" 

... broadly Australia except Moderna, many Pfizer (proportionate population).

Lack foresight, assumed AZ would adequate whole population, prepared overcommit vaccines trials complete, time additional doses available reasonable time frame.   Experts what? Common sense? get one, Janssen vaccination. like.. 17 days ago now? guess although vaccination prevent covid, sure prevent bad outcome longterm negative sufferings you. Maybe Dutch government screwing around numbers day 1, would hav believed it... Sadly clearly did, bred skepticism point think would easier point vaccines aren’t effective delta, that’s actually good sign Antiva dangerous group America capable killing thousands people empathy. I’m really sorry hear this. sounds really scary. second vaccination? Regardless hope ok pull through. alternatives? first-past-the-post like UK US? First-past-the-post really abhorrent, lately accelerating decadence countries it. Trump Brexit would probably never happened without it.  England literally make mistake, altho cases already insanely high… yaaaaay.  never told death vaccine impossible, least anyone reputable. told vaccines 100% effective preventing death *in clinical trials* confidence interval around number expected real world performance. Bad journalism misunderstanding statistics means lot people seem confused 100% actually means thing 100% anything talking millions billions people. teacher, thanks. would take way much class time middle high school teachers checking enforcing doesn’t need wear one. elementary school students aren’t even vaccine eligible yet. seems hard believe people live counties states ever get vaccine. don’t understand it.  tend agree you, met single person real life said got vaccine reason themselves. 

With said benefit others thing fairly large theme here, take will.

I got vaccine variety reasons mainly hate sick, anything avoid sick usually day 2 sick begging medication. 

So me, easy choice, get vaccine free avoid either getting sick together least avoid worst parts COVID-19, sign up. every country conducting widespread vaccination, conversation third shot astra, pfizer, sputnik others, Cuban vaccines factored beginning. 

If mutations, shots may required.  think care kids? think I'm monster something? I’m worried kids getting COVID dying. I’m worried organ damage, potential mutations, passing someone like grandpa.

But honestly last thing anyone wants child lifetime health problems could avoided.  Neither Denmark Ireland excess stock waiting used.

Everybody stock, least last till next delivery. Everybody probably AZ stock hand second shots, since erratic want delay vaccination elderly.

But good points. 

Portugal little vaccination hesitancy decades yes likely end high vaccination rates anyway. get vaccines also getting much can.   seems like every time turn around there’s another variant that’s contagious deadly. Alpha, delta, delta plus, lambda. mostly taking unvaccinated areas, vaccine resistant variant comes play? needle, spray   Greetings Covid Capital Germany, Frankfurt. think wearing masks public transport good, even pain long distance train plane. still wearing inside need tests lots things. caution warranted.

Wearing outside bis longer mandatory, crowded, will. example queuing outside bakery today, everyone masked kept distance.  gotta go WHOLE THING ppl getting vaccinated, imma mad 12 thing slipped mind that’s bad, point remains valid simply it’s nearly guaranteed biggest problem 12s get vaccinated, leading results Firstly, trialed viral infections.

See may notice interpretation section found safe reasonable tolerability profile. might also notice also stated vaccine induce boostable functional antibodies viral antigen administered needle-free device, 

although injected needle-syringe.

This issue adressed recent R&amp;D

here.

The Challenges
1. Instability
Protein expression vaccine administered might insufficient if, instance, half-life vaccine low, vivo mRNA translation insufficient11,12.

2. Inefficient vivo delivery
mRNA vaccine delivery tricky. instance, mRNA aggregate serum proteins undergoes rapid extracellular degradation RNases. Therefore, formulating mRNAs carrier molecules often necessary, delivery formulations need take account factors biodistribution vaccine delivery, mRNA uptake, protein translation rate13,14.

3. Safety
The complexity modulating immunogenicity mRNA used vaccines potentially lead unwanted stimulatory effects immune response15,16,17.

The Recent Advances
1. Optimization mRNA translation stability
Sequence optimization techniques replacing rare codons frequently used synonymous codons18, well enrichment G:C content16, examined increasing vivo protein expression.

2. Progress mRNA vaccine delivery
There numerous delivery methods mRNA vaccines examined literature. recent years, limitations these, using physical methods (e.g., electroporation) penetrate cell membrane, demonstrated19. hand, progress made toward increased efficacy reduced toxicity delivery methods cationic lipid polymer-based delivery13,16,20,21.

3. Modulation immunogenicity
Recent studies demonstrated immunostimulatory profile mRNA controlled precisely using variety techniques. include chromatographic purification remove double-stranded RNA contaminants, introduction naturally-occurring modified nucleosides prevent activation unwanted innate immune sensors, complexing mRNA various carrier molecules (this includes novel approaches adjuvants take advantage intrinsic immunogenicity mRNA)15,17,22,33.

Apart advances techniques purification introduction nucleosides, also improvement understanding techniques used, based factors mRNA platform used, RNA sequence optimization, extent mRNA purification consideration16,24


Here's source e got fuckin idea what’s happening Australia. Sydney affected place moment. Everywhere else open. Even Sydney, started three weeks ago, there’s issue worked hospitals, cancelled exercise, issues cancer diagnostics.

Try learning happens commenting it... otherwise people might mistake moron. Yeah, anxiety nothing else. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Israel one vaccinated countries brought back mandate.  many cases forced be. Last year time stuff barely open all. Malls mainly closed. door dining closed restricted, capacity limits. states even limited could buy Target Walmart. think state really restrictions. catch 22 sure could even go back even needed to. f CDC said Monday masks recomended again, many states would require it? lasted long, myo/pericarditis least! massive pain though :( assume they've checked ribs stuff? saying protection wanes 6 months? Oh yeah definitely! Bandwidth issues aside, think companies able provide good infrastructure. I'll bet they'll use excuse get people back office unknowns long covid children.

We make mandates based “the unknowns” Couldn’t think better way put it. Sooo trueeee!  Always were. could comment every post sub shows front page it'd relevant  reading posted article link, look like different types vaccines? like dump unfinished popcorn floor seats movie, since literally job staff clear theaters showings. Far where? post places US one even thinks covid anymore understand article correctly, think part study. Using PIV5 virus plus COVID protein vaccine. fact trump said got conservative conference mind blowing.

""he forced say that!""

""I thought like trump tough told was""

""....."" even 90% population vaccinated hospitalizations deaths drop effectively 0, must continue mandating masks case long covid? Y’all might touch harsh, article doesn’t say he’s vaccinated not. Also sounds like he’s asymptotic maybe vaxxed? think Venn diagram people refusing shot, people care others two circles touch. happens them, laying hospital bed, breathing respirator, life hanging thread, say regret actions, blame social media, longer personal choice rescued, yada yada. cruel wish covid illness anyone reality.  Please interact users respectfully per [rule sub.  one you’re wearing mostly protects others covid, others wearing mask. wear one protect others chance covid don’t know it. society this, limits spread. wearing mask selfish least possible society. Government fucked up, told you. told people measures could lifted, wearing masks, young people could go clubs one day getting vaccine. Government ignored warnings scientists. Ignored takes two weeks vaccine give effect. 90% new cases young people superspreaders clubs.   fair I’m sure that’s lot people looking for. Whether it’s extension energy miserable lives they’re deranged doesn’t matter. sucks exist that. well call ""Lead Belt"" reason. Whole lotta lead mines contaminated water ways Missouri. Look town names: Leadwood, Leadville, etc. bet water supply Missouri (and neighboring states) makes Flint water look healthy. Ugh, Chuang Yen Temple closed visitors since 2020.

WHY?! easy visit large temple complex taking enough precautions avoid catching disease. absolutely excuse kind action house worship anymore. crossing line understandable precaution outright disrespect.

Even now, they're still closed public despite New York reaching 70% vaccination rate dropping restrictions. important temple behaving like says lot true character. CDC elected body tasked set policies people. That’s politicians forget potential mutations health care workers. like told do. extremely infantile. Idk think that's possible assigned seats drop due antibodies waning, still cellular immunity, T-cells, etc.

So get exposed, make antibodies within days, like would booster. I’m right masks. Mask wearing doesn’t bother (I get could bother others), continue? actually like mouth privacy. Many got boosters 6 month mark, quite effective bringing measurable antibody levels back initial vaccination. fully vaccinated Americans 6 month mark yet, are.  crazy. trust 5G networks far throw 'em. Ehh. quit, hire people replace them. Maybe hospital needs pay provide flexible scheduling perks get retain good people. also free market works. article really dumb  feel bad healthcare workers well. can’t imagine go shit people won’t get vaccinated.  need point. treatments viruses; COVID different. Various antivirals work, tamiflu, almost always need given early progression useful disease. problem particularly hard COVID, symptoms usually show disease peaks. r/noshitsherlock Listen. I'm watching what's going Israel boosters. I'm watching breakthrough cases. think we're gonna need booster shot soon. head sand.

The point made absolutely zero case CDC's guidance. anecdotes source. CDC data. want people listen take seriously, gonna need something stronger ""my friends social media said."" weakening case. Ah, looking question comment replied context—you’re right, unless I’m missing something worrying. Two reasons:

1.) Libs want get shot, way getting shot. (Most love Trump liberals hate him.)

2.) scared needles… come every excuse avoid getting shot. See link bottom huge comment below. Same. I’m compassionate person wishes everyone well matter side aisle you’re on, but. . . . . 

As Ozzy said “I’m going changes” that's fucking terrible. overwork people quit. get car wreck can't get treatment nobody cared hospital workers? Sounds like second dose never enough time take effect person got infected, unfortunately. Majority time full immunity takes 14 days reach maximum strength ... much instant. got infected 14 days up, simply fully protected. I've even seen reports people reach max immunity something like 4 weeks second dose.

You bet employed caution relaxing post-vax behavior according that, everyone understands point. many people make bad assumptions vaccines evident even get vaccinated treat like kind magical insta-shield, act surprised hear people getting infected dying soon shot(s). Question: monetary gain, would Merck, company discovered produces ivermectin, release statement warning use Covid-19? stand profit tremendously people panic-buying, simply making statement come back bite later turned work. Stand back, quiet, profit. Instead, warned people use it. work theory? HEPA filters too. 

Yeah...my school put new air-conditioning back 2015 so. way going put money re-do anything. Sadly U.S. regular job don’t get spend much time family. got spend months playing kids wife every day. loved it. Yes enough 1 doze 8% population. one Taiwan even talking second doze. need something rest world help sick with. course, \~60% Isreal vaccinated, still plenty people category.  vaccinated still get covid19 kid (or another adult). kids adults vaccinated, it'll never ""safe enough"" enclosed room 20-30 people (kids teacher) inside. Obviously people cheering anti-vax statements bad, I’m also concerned Fauci saying doesn’t understand cheering. supposed get vaccinated supposedly don’t understand happy vaccinated? It’s clear cheering, don’t trust government approve vaccine. people say “well dumb rednecks deserve die,” middle aged White conservatives vaccine hesitant group. groups trust government, I’m doubtful would much support saying groups deserve die. comment really made laugh context since I'm living Thailand. government basically putting eggs one basket Sinovac ""some people"" profit. They've gone way make sure Pfizer/Moderna availability delayed again. 

Delta variant hitting us hard herr probably think 600 something cases much lower. People fed say enough low quality vaccines. Let's get quality products here. started requiring people coming back office vaccinated we're seeing enough people either avoid getting vaccines simply avoid sending card gives free pass come back site, forcing everyone back 2 months, vax not, masks required non-vax times eating. terminate people refuse come back violate mask wearing policy.    Sounds like it’s due stricter UK rules never guaranteed protect every single person. might stll made disease less severe. can't say therefore massive positive effect population level.  Yeah, I'm happy see preliminary research findings! city Greene County, 35 percent residents fully vaccinated highly contagious Delta variant spreading.

Yeah statewide, numbers much lower earlier peak, looks like there's localized pockets worse ever. Wonder is... 5th largest economy world? protecting making wear masks. Children really vectors virus rarely seriously harmed it. Teachers vaccinated.

I mask mandates, force children keep masks 6 - 8 hours day ridiculously unnecessary. Getting kids back normal school experience priority. “The staff exhausted overwhelmed” Please DM location I’ll try help find one you.  Kick rocks. don’t trifle totalitarians. specific? would Chinese propaganda try this? True many people need keep alive fight virus. think people left die forgo vaccine get seriously ill need ICU care? That’s harsh. Call crazy I’ll believe 5G networks see them. think know word means fella? Lol, bullshit. Reddit fucking hates China. let’s face it, India far worst affected country virus. one else comes close. Maybe Brazil maybe. Indonesia shot seems refuse either COVID factory COVID stepping stone. COVID get fucked, exactly vaccine-primed immune system it.  I’m Canada we’ve moved mandatory masks “strongly recommended” fully vaccinated. Half population seems heard “no masks”. I’ve numerous service staff tell don’t need wear mask anymore, since they’re “optional”. I’ve others tell it’s “illegal” ask customers wear masks. ability hear want hear uniquely Dutch. Country countries. ""United"" States. offense. expect wants, simply going happen general population give choice. Masks much intrusive seatbelts risk dying car crash exponentially higher buckled in. Overwhelming evidence shows apart rare outliers, children rarely vectors virus minimal danger it. say someone supported mask mandates. They’re right though. seem confident non issue people worried long COVID. Please give evidence think would reassure lot people, thanks.  WOW, say  Well. fairness, USA still ongoing phase 3 clinical trials.

Since, objective, covid vaccines still clinical trials since Emergency Use Authorization Interim Order approval FDA Health Canada. One would assume would get Licensed later time 2023.

This another sub. 

Proof: Pfizer vaccines still phase 3 clinical trials May Moderna vaccine still phase 3 clinical trials October AstraZeneca vaccines still phase 3 clinical trials February J&amp;J vaccines still phase 3 clinical trials January    exactly multiply numbers 

mask wearing public health measures getting vaccines seen idealogoical differences India.

US Brazil seen far largest death toll similar size countries development brackets even close

On side India denser , less health care etc Sounds like Ozarks Healthcare super shitty healthcare company. That’s good reminder, thank you. would absolutely take jnj I've got folks want around unvaccinated people, though, way know vaxxed   grew springfield area. sounds right. numbers sure point bad information whether social conspiracy media religious fanaticism mega church pastor dumb friend spends day reddit constant barrage things look like news facebook doom feed. 

there might moment change peoples' minds EVERYTHING became politicized/jesus-ized now. heels dirt dug battle people now. 

im thankful everyone family back home southwest MO vaxxed (like families there) high risk. mean working, working. trials, people reactions high efficacy people reactions.

This something that's said make people feel better. Well, I've got appointment second dose scheduled today! know people recover 1-2 days I'm fully vaccinated Moderna jab pretty much known side effects 7-10 days recovery time. lingering side effects lasted bit longer like armpit tenderness. said, I'd since better getting virus. Even people bad case refusing get vaccine. free data suggests better getting it. 

Not that, data suggests covid, receive one dose 2 dose vaccine, better protected covid recieved doses.  going worst wave yet across Southern US low vax areas. 

r/LeopardsAtMyFace going get lot new content soon.  also vaccine optimised Delta variant, things considered, surprisingly well. booster shots development target recent mutations mop leaves behind. Good point mean, literally low-information problem America right now. may offend lots studies many rural America get news. using multiple independent sources verify news stories good media literacy.  yet see single study preventing Long Covid following mild infection.

So study? picking choosing whatever facts suits silly internet argument even statements contradict other? 🤣 survivors actually got boats saved.

This would like every time survivors got lifeboats, lifeboats sunk main ship *anyway*. really hope we'll see data younger people soon.

In United States, lot places prioritized vaccines teachers—which means immunity may fading school year starts again, classrooms full unvaccinated students mitigation measures abandoned.  18 hours misery cleared quickly. Would without second thought. ""I need information.""

Translation: believe anything tell me. HÀ NỘI — fourth day running, Việt Nam recorded record high new COVID-19 infections.

Sunday saw 1,953 new cases announced daily tally including eight imported cases and 1,945 locally transmitted infections.

Of new local cases, HCM City reported 1,397, bringing total local number infections reported city fourth wave the pandemic to 13,012.

Cases also recorded Bình Dương (234), Đồng Tháp (50), Tiền Giang (46), Long (46), Vĩnh Long (43), Phú Yên (36), Bắc Giang (13), Bắc Ninh (10), Hậu Giang (9), Bến Tre (7), Giang (7), Hà Nội (7), Đà Nẵng (6), Ninh Thuận (4), Hưng Yên (3), Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu (3), Sóc Trăng (3), Bình Phước (2), Hà Tĩnh (2), Bình Thuận (2), Bình Định (2), Lâm Đồng (2), Trà Vinh (2), Quảng Ngãi (2), Cà Mau (1), Quảng Nam (1), Bạc Liêu (1), Đắk Nông (1), Hải Phòng (1), Thanh Hoá (1) Cần Thơ (1).

As many 1,361 Sunday’s new local cases detected quarantine locked-down areas.

The ongoing fourth wave infections began in April included 26,322 local cases, pushing overall national tally since beginning pandemic 29,816.
Of overall caseload, 27,892 locally transmitted 1,924 cases imported.

The health ministry also reported 71 recoveries Sunday evening, bringing country’s total 9,275.

A total 116 COVID-19 fatalities recorded Việt Nam far, 81 fourth wave. — VNS general gist comments many believe trump supports far gone world better place live gone  Insurance companies hospitals, Israel HMOs owns hospitals, insurance company become HMO enough market share. correct, meant. 3rd party confirm findings taken seriously US, answer clearly yes IMO. Without made political would far acceptance masks help reduce spread acceptance mitigation efforts general. Politicized though still would lots disagreements level restrictions needed.  still would lot deaths many. Still lot suspect. Politicized US would never accept level lockdowns occurred New Zealand Australia. news, water wet sky blue.  “All sudden everybody said it’s done, it’s not,” said Tom Keller, president chief executive officer Ozarks Healthcare, runs hospital clinics southern Missouri. “I don’t know delta variant got Springfield, Missouri, didn’t get East Coast first.”

And can’t figure Delta variant didn’t start coast. Could difference vaccinations masks? could resist  agree, unvaccinated singled point feel left rest society, maybe push get shot.  Call crazy, I’ll wait it’s longer emergency approval manufacturers liability. Hey! I’m prof taught person last fall. deaf student class read lips. given masks like 

Worked great! I've wondered months sure teaching, kid's public school CA, state gave funds put HEPA filters every classroom could open in-person end March. Moderna.

The first shot, even feel needle!

Second one bad time LOL  True work same, vaccinated need wear mask, wear mask. Provide proof vaccinated office manager. 

People complying hear unvaccinated complain make excuses get shot(s). (the vaccinated) tried try rebut arguments tough convince someone mind made up. 

Interesting times in. I’ve noticed case fatality rate low recent wave Covid UK. almost everyone high risk vaccinated? Meaning it’s mostly spreading young unvaccinated people. Vaccine service.

Pay annual subscription 20% fewer side effects! Western Co (Mesa County) high infection rates while. infections increasing denver, boulder, metros well. 

People speculated it’s state’s fitness health might causing hesitancy/complacency. People think theyre fit healthy dont want extra something protection. Don’t endorse that’s picture I’m gathering remember that. letter incredibly smug, pretentious, demanding lots extra stuff like O2 sensors permanently limiting capacity based kind measurement. Basically lot stuff probably read Twitter thought could bully executives spending millions comply despite evidence actually understanding asking for.  Israel also universal healthcare? seems like countries modern universal healthcare done lot better pandemic. shit, Sherlock! seems irrational mentally unstable. thought necessary recommend stop worrying go outside fears irrational. everything started sending shots countries. lowered amount vaccines ordering, moved vaccines close expiration areas wouldn’t waste. 

It’s shameful many US refusing vaccination. One person interviewed even said Trump encouraged vaccine, believes would get shot. makes wonder know Trump vaccinated. picky. plenty news Sinovac ""killing"" people here. Generally fake misleading information. I've heard vaccine fears firsthand. said, also lot us want get vaccine cannot. Foreigners outside tourists hubs Bangkok banned receiving vaccines, even we're otherwise covered Thailand's public healthcare system. Moderna allocation private hospitals chance beyond leaving country. Pseudoscience complete lack evidence aside, let's think saying. 

You're telling us pill cures COVID cost pennies manufacture. Despite this, one single pharmaceutical company thought demonstrate effectiveness, publish findings sell product mere dollars rake returns 100x cost them. Lol, sure. ""ya'll come back now...ya hear?"" one adults. read study NPR article said live vaccines diseases showing offer immunity viruses doctors scientists suggesting get live flu nasal shot year form protection Covid. Apparently Africa seeing people get immunity things shouldn’t receiving vaccine it’s blowing scientific community’s mind. Interesting stuff. live vaccine. Wow, specific. think children shouldnt wear seatbelts. risk accident soo miniscule stupid worry about. Stop living fear kid going thru windsheild. /s

Do understand sound now? 12% outliet. guys talking asses. kind shocking see hive mind anti-vaxxers have, except going direction. you’re willing prove you’re vaccinated get old office back. not, get seat conference room, separated everyone else. fades sing together....

Mamma Mia~~ go again~~ everyone else. it’s heart inflammation you’re worried know it’s extremely rare happens it’s treatable. mention fact heart inflammation potentially deadly effects much common COVID itself. I’m words vaccine thousand times safer getting COVID. Get vaccinated. fact surgeons wear masks 12 hours time beaten death point, that’s much longer 99% us would wear one without able find alone time take break. you’re talking physical effects. 

Could expand sort adverse effects you’re talking about? know anecdotal, work multiple outbreaks year half. time resulted positive tests people worked close positive person. year two people get sick test positive positive results vaccinated worked close them. 

So little world, vaccinated people exposed testing negative getting sick. one positive cases year unvaccinated employees.

On quick count, roughly 75% vaccinated. Major bits:

""There growing correlation vaccinated Israelis infected Delta variant coronavirus among first get vaccine, possibly indicating vaccine’s protection fades time, report said Sunday.

However, experts working Health Ministry cautioned early draw conclusions, since sample size small vaccinated first mostly elderly, weaker immune system begin with""


""The report said Dr. Arik Haas Health Ministry’s Public Health Service division recently presented data ministry, showing “there growing correlation got vaccinated early — mostly January — recently infected.”


""The data showed vaccine still protected people serious illness.

However, many within Health Ministry believe data matter still insufficient draw conclusions, report said.""


""Haas believes even controlling age factors, main reason renewed outbreak vaccine’s protection fades time, Delta strain bypasses it.""


Bunch back forth intersting still. Ugandan government minister blamed west country’s inability secure Covid-19 vaccines, World Health Organization warned Africa urgently needed hundreds millions jabs fend surging third wave Baryomunsi said Uganda able vaccinate million people unable obtain problem supply side,” said Baryomunsi, also epidemiologist. “We money simply can’t get vaccine. challenge access equity. rely western world western world focused population. impression people don’t care Africans.”

…

Hard disagree logic. Call centers 10 days. don’t plan taking additional vaccine unless there’s booster released. either....but viruses, yes haha Source? someone says ""I feel heart racing"" absurd assume myocarditis *can* symptom it. 

Of course asymptomatic, OP asymptomatic. stated feel arrhythmia, felt prior vaccine well. infinitely likely possibility arrhythmia. fear monger. aware vaccine side effects one thing, concluding extremely rare reaction another  would expected. Nothing surprising. Uh, vaccinated help protect vulnerable? understand 1.5 years pandemic? Jesus Christ. Ivermectin failing DBCTs. mRNA vaccines mostly safe, overwhelmingly safe high efficacy means risk protection ratio extremely high. Interesting. always told 2000 lol Looking says ""well 200"" means could 300, 500, 1 million lol Well mean anything haha Oh well :) "
