0,2021-06-16," least taking mask help bit EU, trip booked UK end October. I‚Äôd wait longer, need use FY2020 vacation days end FY2021. It‚Äôs four months away. rate Canada vaccinating, rate cases dropping, I‚Äôm hopeful I‚Äôll able go planned.

But I‚Äôm glad made sure cancel get money back week departure date. honesty best policy! Im glad ok. symptoms, bad his? wasnt hospitalized he? immunity Moderna Pfizer vaccines powerful weaker strain virus (such spreading last year).    Lot people Reddit downvoting anything positive news. That's ""fatigue"". horrendous difference?  previously infected people count? seem well received Dutch subreddits look. different approaches countries also really confusing, surely looking data. Denmark already gotten rid except standing passengers public transport. Sweden ever recommendation use rush hour case. there's great hesitancy removing outdoor mask Spain indoors Gibraltar Israel despite massively successful vaccination rollouts completely crushing case numbers. Ireland, health minister saying masks may one measures we'll still end year. fully vaccinated, interact ppl not. still potentially give ppl COVID. wear mask indoor time outdoor soon see people UK slightly higher second vaccination rate US. Although data suggests AZ 20% less effective MRNA delta US probably still better position. Im Chicago well, got fully vaxxed(Pfizer)as yesterdayüéâü•≥. And, I‚Äôm even happy knowing slight increase week week.  Probably redditors insist take masks, humanity go extinct. It‚Äôs bit feedback loop, though. Employers care customer sentiment. continue see customers masking mandates lifted, assume it‚Äôs customers prefer. solidarity may creating opposite effect. Canada gap AZ 12 weeks. changed recommendation 8-12 weeks. Vermont one lowest levels wealth inequality Pfizer gang gang Ohio, too, despite ""Vaxamillion"" enough people 2nd vaccinated

More USA per capita Children 12 perfectly safe. UK, teaching children 12 continued without social distancing masks many staff still waiting second vaccine (a small number first). children dying covid. Alabama well. feel like I‚Äôm one still living reality here. anti-vaxxers reason delta vaccine appeared. saying ""it's serious"" unspecific. mean?

A fire house serious. email work may also serious, level. people, getting 10 cent coupon serious. subjective word.

And fully vaccinated people, far know, still protected huge degree. case, think serious would appropriate word choice. I'd still prefer facts first. curiosity's sake, could try antibody test  That's good point. Hopefully Moderna applying full authorization, standard full approval far away either. say that? thanks good news :) experience anything go by, first bad, second much worse‚Ä¶ side effects go away 24 hrs least doesn‚Äôt last long.  also said young people better Dose interval CureVac trials 28 days (technically 29) apart 
 Please provide evidence fact, thought still theory? unvaxed kids ppl compromised immune systems vaxed UNICEF recommend children 12 wear masks. Giving masks free able obvious choice action course would never do. got J&amp;J vaccine months ago, Delta variant running rampant I'm worried waiting get Pfizer Moderna vaccine. data info effective J&amp;J vaccine Delta variant? That's true, also probably noted includes people part population eligible receive vaccine (because they're 12 years old).

The current CDC numbers (as 6/16/21):

Group | least one dose | Fully Vaccinated | Doses Yet
---|---|----|----
Total Pop. | 52.7 | 44.1 | 47.3
Pop. (Age 12+) | 61.7 | 51.6 | 38.3
Pop. (Age 18+) | 64.7 | 54.8 | 35.3
Pop. (65+)| 86.9 | 76.6 | 13.1

Of course, fact substantial part population can't vaccinated they're old enough means important everyone *can* get vaccinated does. 38.3% unvaccinated rate among population definitely high, maybe slightly less terrifying 47.3% value? guess? nothing else idea nearly 87% people 65 older gotten least one dose seems encouraging. sudden. People talking least year.  wasn‚Äôt net positive! straight line lie Trump saying exact thing year!  vector vaccines infuse spike protein them. DNA inside vectors tells body create spike protein. 

In essence, they're like mRNA vaccines terms end result i.e body creating spike proteins. UK lockdown. drink pubs, eat restaurants, visit friends ans family, travel anywhere, go cinema shops open. Probably bad.

Virus needs bodies spread 60%+ immune won‚Äôt spread much.

Probably small super spreader events amongst unvaccinated people exactly happening now.  Yes. best uptake areas 95+% 50s, worst areas 80%.  first shot like that, hope 2nd worse got AZ first dose booked Moderna second dose. It‚Äôs nice see. London turning Little America. imported worse aspects USA gang culture, woke culture, fashion tendency anti-vax. like different country rest England.  earth shattering, someone got AZ government medical field told take whatever can, annoying.

Am supposed go get two Phizer shots too? safe? specific reason. people use numbers agenda (total pop make number look low, eligible make number look larger). But, fair metric use, reporting, eligible. gives us better answer ""how many people getting vaccine?"" include people even able vaccinated, numbers always shifted whatever percent non-eligible make up. heard understand you‚Äôre saying, severely. didn‚Äôt mean come crass. fact didn‚Äôt want others even loved ones still helping others. thank you! I‚Äôd guess there‚Äôs chance could back time start series clears tests. According Q posted theatre‚Äôs website, guests ‚ÄúSpringsteen Broadway,‚Äù intimate show featuring Boss performing solo starting June 26, need fully vaccinated FDA-approved jab. means least two weeks days second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna. least 14 days one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen vaccine. sudden, everyone saying symptoms december 2019 B.1.1.7, alfa variant Kent, UK.

First, UK got hit. Terrible wave lots deaths. Vaccinations barely started.

Then EU got hit. Lots cases also rise deaths. even close bad waves. Probably due limited vaccinations, going slow EU. enough prevent wave.

After US turn B.1.1.7 wave. hit B.1.1.7 later successful vaccination campaign, managed stay ahead wave due vaccinations. definitely still tiny wave.

What three waves alfa variant show, vaccinations enough control spread waves variant. US managed prevent wave mostly due vaccines, EU UK used vaccines control spread alfa variant after/during waves.

Now Delta variant shown lot worrying. time creating wave unvaccinated area like UK end 2020, one vaccinated places world. Delta variant spreading succeeding much difficult environment, time, US edge. basically vaccinated, less, areas far behind terms delta variant spread. guess would batter use facilities manufacture Pfizer/moderna though. loads rules apply children teachers. different? still table projected vaccine deliveries, don‚Äôt think vaccination plan depends 1 026 000 Curevac doses expecting Q3. 

The adult population Sweden ~8.2 million, without Curevac still get 17 million doses September, enough give 2 doses everyone age 18. Ha username. agree yet are. 51% 14 days dose interval. 21 days interval 62%.  
And study health care workers...

Does anyone know dose interval curevac trial? That's interesting, idea allowed combine like that. Best luck tomorrow! really is. 60% transmissible Alpha already 50% original strain, somewhat resistant vaccines two doses provide significant protection, well new symptoms associate Covid before. can't go restrictions forever, vaccinate learn live risks, let people get lives. unable access story link go sign Washington Post's coronavirus newsletter provide coronavirus coverage free charge.  article isn‚Äôt lockdown.

Sometimes headline headline. Explain. ordered got pushed line less cases? countries plan keep bay enough vaccine coverage. side effect 1. Getting vaccine deliveries delayed they‚Äôre desperate 2. People interested vaccines arrive false sense security. 

Then outbreak happens. fast! Kawhi Leonard might miss series knee injury could‚Äôve said supplies low instead calling masks ineffective! choice! led stupid anti-masker shit!

It wasn‚Äôt failure messaging, lie.  Yeah, densely populated cities high enough immunity trigger outbreak.

Vaccine hesitant areas lower population density governors won‚Äôt give two shits there‚Äôs outbreak there. See happened Dakotas winter.

All see mask mandates work home coming back winter, all. I‚Äôd say 99.999999% people use word ‚Äúgaslight‚Äù internet don‚Äôt know is, including context. cases beginning, eventually whole lot hospitalisations deaths.

Yep, that's definitely way would go. know people want positive, think US going soon. UK countries rollout complete uptake high, that's case US, even liberal urban areas. Delta variant already accounts 18 percent cases Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming

Why surprising slightest... Another solution using existic stock would double dose matches Pfizer dose. would require another trails, would waste time. Better use resources produce BioNTech vaccine. think 4chan much, go touch grass more, reality different social media. lol  Check subreddit today, article delta variant. AZ markedly lower performance it, something like 60%.  would say sucks less least Novavax. :) mine, neighbor's. However, think rare occurrence, even hospitalization two shots be, still seems non-zero chance. unlucky.

One thing consider though, know turn relevant studies made, seems among early batches elderly people got vaccinated India shots AZ / Covishield given 5-6 weeks apart. increased 3 months here. Maybe factor too, wait see efficacy indeed improves bigger gap doses.

My parents vaccinated second dose exactly 6 weeks apart, bit worried actually. Agree general, unvaccinated people provide host virus. Every chance virus gets replicate, chance mutations increase, lead variants. continue use masks indoors strangers. indoor dining unless vaccine verifications let in. sucks, underlying condition want take chances. sure many like me. Isn‚Äôt part genius covid virus long incubation period, person spreading unknowingly? doesn‚Äôt matter deadly. Ooof. big hopes company feel like going loop entire alphabet variants end Alpha Alpha variant. internet actually helped. Anyone 40 UK get mRNA vaccine. reached 99% protection yet? basically everything already knew still applies: vaccines give 100% protection - still affecting mostly older people.

OP responding made claim. jumped without reading spammed bunch unrelated articles me. Sit down. need move invest Pfizer Moderna.

And Novavax. Unless could allergic reaction vaccine course guess wearing mask forever then. Like Hello, people NEVER know vaccinated virus never going go away.  88% means around 1 10 people still vulnerable. estimates 2 10 double Pfizer dose. worse AZ J&amp;J. look countries used Chinese, lower efficacy vaccines virus stopped despite lower efficacy - higher percentage (75% least based Brazilian town) vaccinated.

My personal take is: keep wearing masks inside higher number people country double dose, meet vaccinated people possible. Protection associated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca vaccine) was, however, substantial reduced: 73% (95% CI 66‚Äì78) gene-negative cases versus 60% (53‚Äì66) gene-positive (appendix p AZ, J&amp;J similar.

Pfizer much better, though, Moderna. Great point. Wow that's really short interval.

This perfect answer. Thank you! friend confirmed twice last year, several months apart. He‚Äôs 30-50 age group Hopefully , deport people refuse get vaccinated Island.

It‚Äôs people smart forever. read article? Let know ever get answer this. I've asked 3 doctors, said ""Nope, good"" 

But im wondering makes sense go grab Moderna / Pfizer vaccine get better coverage. took available time....but increase immunity, would like too.   lot people (adolescents) became eligible vaccination past 3-4 weeks. Yeah it‚Äôs still possible.  America never united around social issues probably never will. think enforce ""right thing"" states absurd. fact entire idea federal system states fairly autonomous.

The America 60s united either fine. Population density, multi-generational housing, climate.

Also, US whole higher mask compliance UK. (Obviously Florida).

But say, I'm sure vitamin levels, population age, hospital beds played part well.

Also, bad US handling covid, UK bungled nearly bad. Remember Boris Johnson's plan get herd immunity letting everyone get Covid?

Reddit loves rag bad Trump's covid response number states actually pretty good responses. (Again, obviously Florida) Heard sick live would scary fuck. Already ravaged world. Sure understand it, don‚Äôt condone it. understand everyone‚Äôs patience severely tested, America crumble continues fracture within. bat flew cloaca turkey sneezed chilli delta variant.

Shut stupid sub  think acceptance 600k dead year pandemic, people care never will. states care never will. 

I feel it. feels like ample opportunity give shit people don't. waste time trying drag idiots reality. hate it. can't fix stupid can't force states right thing.

Fuck em.  plenty cases people getting COVID twice. Thanks article actually explicitly says vaccine also makes less likely you‚Äôll spread virus  Wooo team Moderna, we're awesome  Probably increase antivaxers sub. latch new posts comments sink. shit, state in? Also, saw someone recently say mom think got covid 3 weeks fully vaccinated need hospitalized, lose sense taste smell two weeks returned yet think true, also much easier ignore. you' family vaccinated, live area low vaccination rates, may time stop paying attention news.

Personally, I'm past caring outbreaks Alabama, Wyoming, etc. I'd like know too... Seems like AZ vaccine consistently poorer Pfizer Moderna, time pointed there's always gotcha purports explain why.  got covid December, donated blood February antibodies. Got shots April, donated blood last week antibodies. Ymmv Moderny gang  Every time there‚Äôs new variant feel like bill murray Groundhog Day.

Fyi, Delta Variant dominant strain India second wave. significant portion people died, 40. healthy 25yos lost lives Delta variant. Rest leave judgement. Personally, I‚Äôd love covid deniers changed minds. Isn‚Äôt goal? doesn‚Äôt want that? However unlikely, getting covid deniers change minds pandemic ends. Punishing shaming previously held beliefs achieves what, exactly? anti-body level 9000! dozens us, dozens! keep knocking can't come in! Given know asymptomatic/mild carriers major way virus spreads, none surprising. got cold months back still wearing mask everywhere. pretty bad one, too. wish wrong sadly know right. They'll ones mostly likely cause thing go vaccine resist vaccine proof. cause can't use common sense, critical thinking logic processing. someone explain variants became dangerous wuhan variant?
I thought viruses general mostly mutated transmittable less dangerous variants, virus want host survive. Hang there, leading edge! Let people go parties stuff first, look look after

Stay safe, SANE! chicken egg thing. places lowest vaccination rates filled type people governments least likely lock down. Mississippi ain't locking down. Whereas place like California *would* willing, would less likely need vaccination rate. Can‚Äôt read writing? don‚Äôt time respect others time troll internet really symptoms either Moderna vaccine. everybody different. nytimes tracks U.S. total people best prolong epidemic year.   I've got many cute masks, including two got test actual,face. work conventions yeppers I'll continue wearing them. Considering fast rollout - don‚Äôt find progress recent weeks impressive, honest. seems stagnation around 70% level. Compared UK Israel, US curve flattening much sooner. I‚Äôm racist, I‚Äôm fan fraternity style naming system. Using country discovery helps people visualize setting variant exists, also helps us spectate lifestyle/economic factors play.  Yeah concerning thing drops relying 18-24 year olds, 23-28% say take 15% say undecided. 

Which pretty pathetic, idea they're dumb, 60s 3% refusal rate comparison. minister education wants schools go back full capacity third wave-teachers havent vaccinated. 

And department education rules comes close contacts. considered close contact spend 15 min without mask near someone tests positive covid 19. make person 15 min cant get covid? Thats logic got co worker mine killed. 

Apparently covid takes 15 min spread according department education's guidelines. royally fucked teachers SA learners. 

They want us continue teaching dont want send people site visit afraid high infection rateüòÇ Whoa slow maestro, there‚Äôs new mexico ?   No, using Greek letters. really works.

Lastly never checked toxicity reproductive effects primates humans mice, would never released general public normal conditions.

Which brings last point phase 3 trial data gathered producers running study side effects they're relying various public databases cooked wave new reports (larger number reports year vaccines 70+ vaccines 30 years).

All I'm saying unknowns efficacy safety better informed taking decision like using yet experimental therapy children, cases past like Thalidomide passed regulations system got mass adoption 4 years later proven tragedy, systems place FDA skirted medications. pushing story? convinces lab leak true. small city. Japan. guess what!!? damn Olympics coming.. Since much contagious vaccinating play enormous roll becoming something Healthcare system handle without mandatory shut downs. want shut downs past. Yes, think matters ages died we're playing around mutation overwhelm exhausted health care workers again. deserve better. Take vaccine. FYI us places hard even get doses vaccines. access easily, take it. never thought adult would moderate intake news seriously, anyone wants talk fucked world sometimes need block everything something fun stop getting depressed whole thing. want ignorant current events there's much take.  False even contradict yourself. upvoted wasn‚Äôt age, clinical vulnerability also priority group U.K. differences severe disease likelihood remain really age-graded - even 20 30 it‚Äôs like 10x difference, altho low either way. UK strategy extremely effective bringing death rate, compare European countries USA right it‚Äôs 5-10x lower per capita. However issue second dose delay young people mixing without vaccines causing cases go up. Thankfully young people getting vaccinated hopefully turn things around. Well China actively deliberately destroying evidence lab Someone needs hug terms timeline terms deliveries, though order still there.  chiming add actually makes covid nasty, transmit host asymptomatic... 18 days (normally 10).

This means even kill host, would ready spread set reproductive goal.

Not doomer means, strongly stand vaccines, chance covid could become deadly transmissible. ever seen Hillary Fauci time? Shapeshifting space gecko, obviously perfect treatment. wouldn‚Äôt say O2, steroids, monoclonal antibodies, etc. completely ineffective. Delta variant

B.1.617.2, aka India variant. Well, need reopen point, not? suggest normal life resumes? another year lockdowns?

\- Spread mostly un-vaccinated young people

\- UK lot people vaccinated Astrazeneca, perhaps less effective Delta variant mRNA vaccines

\- additional infections also lead higher hospitalizations (especially vaccinated people)?

It's true r0 bit 1, total cases still low(and pointed here, exponential growth already stopped) keeping 3 points mind reason panic. argument vaccinate people better vaccines.

Vaccinating way this. scared lockdowns forever not.  bummer get attention desperately need? seen takes 5 weeks post second dose reach max efficiency. Initially efficacy Alpha 66% around 73% per latest reports PHE. Even 2 week gap 2nd dose 92 % effective preventing hospitalization compared 96% Pfizer. 

It lower efficacy infection. common viral vector vaccines.  wont :) always, truth somewhere middle. normal people, get vaccinated practice minimum health protocols (mask etc.).   Seems problematic Awww, thanks! laugh...or cry. Coping mechanism, guess. ‚ÄúTrust fragile thing ‚Äî hard earn, easy lose.‚Äù M.J.

Im maybe 10% people city still wearing one  /u/Viewfromthe31stfloor bad thing, least public months old wondering

At time, public health officials country would tell us wearing masks help media would say someone pleading public health officials recommend mask wearing press conference conspiracy theorist.

Things changed. lab leak theory longer ""almost certainly true"".  Lol malaga week ago. nightclubs 300 masks. funny stupid. Policies be. Exactly. Everything said. FWIW article talking ""leak"" (i.e., something present lab accidentally got out) deliberate creation.

I believe virus escaped studied (either directly due gain-of-function) still possibility based evidence have, compounded China's lack transparency. likely crossed another species and, course, viral labs tend located near sources viruses they're studying, Wuhan kind place would *expect* happen (and that's lab's there, way around).

However, idea COVID19 engineered bioweapon like medieval peasants believing visited person devil, i.e., looking give evil humanoid form make comprehensible. Thank cnn, article bullshit Well possibility getting shot wacko snapped told wear mask like happened georgia couple days ago.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Considering none viruses protect 100% people symptomatic infection, obviously *some* vaccinated people able spread it. unknown many, any, vaccinated people protected enough notice becoming infected might spread extent. 93% efficacy alpha 88% delta still rolling dice. Sure it'll likely lessen symptoms even guarantee.

The point vaccines containment - herd immunity. enough people around world antibodies cease pandemic like contagions like common cold avoid getting years time. vaccination get jail free card. 34 million positive test cases USA 14 documented cases confirmed reinfections. ""Hah need annual flu vaccine! flu last year!"" Sarbecoviruses. Think entire situation driving car.

* Social distancing = defensive driving keeping brake distance.
* Washing hands = wearing seatbelt.
* Wearing mask = lights, including daytime fog lights.
* Vaccine = airbag ABS. 

All things make safer traffic. reduces likelihood getting crash, reduces likelihood severely injured crash, none stop 60 mph, 100 lbs truck tire coming across highway median smashing car getting t-boned intersection. add another case this, friend twice last year, April August.  See above.

a) Get kids vaccinated (0% currently here)

b) Get adults vaccinated (51% currently here)

If a) happens, sit back let nature take course work anti-vaxxers. But, man sense ethics, want that, I'd greatly prefer solve problem b) (now) a) (when data in). Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seems unlikely connection, FDA investigates VAERs reports, able tell pattern. vaccines, long term effects effects happen right away, thay go away cause permanent damage. Long term effects happens weeks months later, never happened vaccine, seems unlikely happen Covid vaccines. patent argument really true. Yes.....there patents could enforced, majority knowledge make exact vaccines patents: technical know-how, precise manufacturing processes approved regulators, etc. 

It's simple companies saying, ""Go ahead. enforce patents you."" factories still know make can't reading patents trying copy techniques. Even produced vaccine way, would different vaccine produced company select sites rigorous quality control every aspect manufacturing storage. even straight forward company like J&amp;J set new J&amp;J-controlled manufacturing facilities.....much less set one teams scientists they've never worked before, know teams capabilities, facilities they're unfamiliar with. long J&amp;J team stay new facility supervising monitoring.....when could facility already producing life-saving vaccines developing Generation 2 vaccines variants? 

I'm saying self-interest involved companies they're making money stuff, blame patent enforcement false. read study well. data looks hopeful, however direct quote study: ""However, recent emergence variant relatively low case numbers meant possible estimate severe disease.""

The study says enough data soon draw conclusions. I'm vaccines all. I'm vaccinated. obvious vaccines help. concern people eager return normal life wont exercise caution vaccinated. think foolish concerned variant. multiple reports statements government agencies warning potential Delta variant cause another wave. I'm saying need lock panic weeks mask wearing unreasonable. sure I'm downvoted. honest question. I'm mean south African variant, UK variant curious people think they're slick üôÑ

Also, anyone actually **flu** wish anyone. Proper influenza makes one sick weeks.    understand comment controversial - asking source encouraged scientific discussions article little sensationalist... Delta variant serious reasons worries US. 

1. controlling UK (alpha) variant currently spreading. indicates high level immunity (through shots prior infections). 
2. likely always going get exit wave. summer bad time get it, since seasonality disease. Delta hitting winter would much worse situation. 
3. People worried future, resistant variants, fair. advantages: high levels immunity previous strains, unlikely variant makes vaccines 0% effective. harder see serious spread everyone immunity. Second, booster progress Beta variant, immune evasive. future immune evasive variants use mutations, vaccine help lot. 

Get vaccinated, tell others vaccinated low vaccinated area. High vaccinated cities states may see moderate exit wave high levels low vaccinated areas. reporting, reporting - straight jail. water WET!!!!!   Op full 

23% 40 cases hospitalized, nowhere state 20 something 40 died. 

Source here, noted become another arm culture wars. enough data know one way regarding effectiveness vaccines delta variant? haven‚Äôt followed closely. question efficacy rates vaccines. know everyone trials exposed virus? didn‚Äôt make point expose everyone, let live lives normal. bunch staying isolated home like me? also didn‚Äôt get virus, I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since end april. Interesting. Perhaps populated UK terms size country? Especially cities, everyone pretty much top other? might develop mutation makes vaccines ineffective

That whole lot better chance vaccinated population. Sinovac basically useless one dose, wonder people two doses. likely not.  Mehh fair always downsides era history. realiize mind hesitant person, wrongly interpret vaccine useless ? headline titled bad way. Let‚Äôs hope so. Money talks. Issue UK we've said 12-17 year olds vaccinated - least priority (unless underlying condition). Really annoying. Maybe initial cases smaller? Paris, London, Rome, european cities major tourist destinations. difference starting month February 15 cases compared 40 cases end making huge difference larger scale, especially since restrictions place. African countries given heads saw Europe get bad March 2020, chance mask early got close stage Europe going through. Also population much younger Europe‚Äôs population, risk less too.  don‚Äôt want fear monger pull something thin air meant scare people ask others source claim. That‚Äôs classic fear mongering data AstraZeneca delta variant? thought sinopharm still good sinovac? New zealand? Various email services allow create alternate email addresses account, may filtered sent main email address. also use throwaway secondary account well. Making one takes next effort, ever once. Facebook social media reigned in. platforms guilty politicians. shit surprising underreported. mean literally opened bookings 23+ yesterday. really help holiday plans age group likely get second jab 8-12 weeks...right summer ends, fuck shit island might, depending country vaccine status. However, UK government issues recognizing anything EU, including vaccine passports; course decision allow double-vaccinated entries without quarantine makes sense context local distribution variants. IOC answerable one seems. Best comment thread. Thanks clarifying. haven‚Äôt read much status uk vaccinations. well US apparently. Probably there‚Äôs much press rising rates variants. Oh neat. used examples things excluded definition inflation.

I love betting morons like cheering inflation less (walk-ins OK hotspots, places still open 21+), long gap first second doses practically means that, 18+ given first dose within next weeks, second doses ongoing least September. Nah don‚Äôt beat up, blame lies squarely feet Nurgle cultists flew with. me, ‚ÄúDelta Plus‚Äù sounds like Dental Insurance? believe you, though seems depends much crypto involved. Giving away email address spammed much pain ass me.

My point I'm willing pay it, simple feeling entitled. Things likely better along people wore masks. things open back people wear masks indoors longer I‚Äôm okay that. sars 15 years ago people kept wearing masks flu season felt bit weather. think normalizing masks good thing. Maybe everyone time wearing masks remain common imho. solve it? ideas? Also, even one mask reduce viral load significantly? Sure still get bug going get huge dose bug. county lead nation vaccinations while, got stuck 55%. state much better.

We need solve problem, declare victory. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Nosocomial infection general thing though, surprising happens covid.   think begin mass manufacturing. think change two doses regimen three doses. would higher antibody level, still waste current productions. Isn‚Äôt UK offering vaccines everyone now? thought read open age groups. Sigh... late 1990s? Back going India fashionable. Hospitals worst place go pandemic always think zombie movie bitten infected people taken hospital. New variant in. Varient Z Zombie Previous infections give protection, certainly count. Plus, one dose plus prior infection equal two doses. bet mutation. Nope, check log graphs. hate shit, ""loophole"" imbeciles using flights now. * still exponentially growing, slower rate earlier. really is. Delta variant concern, scaremongering make sense all. vaccines still highly effective, basically range original phase 3 trials. tl;dr is: second doses important.  Tuesday, health authorities found new confirmed cases Guangzhou, city 15 million people became China‚Äôs new Covid first new case, 75-year-old woman, detected May 21. first time delta variant virus, first identified India, detected concerned highly transmissible nature variant took action west Guangzhou, parts district locked down. People allowed areas except special circumstances. restaurants close, others operated take-out reduced workers lined streets Guangzhou carry mass coronavirus testing population. Tens millions people tested last two police Guangzhou fined detained individuals allegedly broke laws wearing masks public, cooperating asked take coronavirus test.

‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs 38%.

I‚Äôm tired this. wish alive age different era history calmer true leaders.   bet omega.  used UK India dominant.   likely that? dishonor supervillain origin story. Fuck it, don‚Äôt get click then. may new vaccine created. There‚Äôs study Uk, Delta primary variant.

One Pfizer dose reduces hospitalization 94% across age groups Delta. 

94 zero, still die, dramatically less

Unvaccinated, honestly, that‚Äôs choice point Contact mods, problem another source fixed it. guessing it‚Äôs parody account. Yes that's true, ultimately US many areas that, even vaccine rollout, sufficiently vaccinated. Unless uptake improves across board, suffer due Delta.   understanding infects lymph nodes allowing spread fast (if get treatment within 24 hours symptoms chances good). infects area kills tissue causes widespread necrosis, spread blood cause sepsis quickly too. Moderna gang, checking in! üí™üèΩ

Pfizer? like PLOZER think that's exactly worry scientists have. mutation occurs renders current vaccines useless. already believe become obsolete less 9 months. variants like continue, zero protection. right back beginning. So, idea could never get bad fantasy. good probability get bad again. pandemic fatigue, could become much worse refusal lock again. dead may never die dumb fucking take. Move on? shit investigated. LOL, telling negative press scaring people Astra Zeneca might saving grace? :P  think likely too. people vaccinated, even get symptoms, likely get paranoid scared dying it. likely get tested. Especially someone's bubble fully vaccinated, even less likely get tested. friend sent picture cake gathering ""Covid OVER!"" written it. kind reminded photo George Bush aircraft carrier ""Mission Accomplished!"" banner behind him, declaring Iraq War won. course, Iraq War continued simmer years afterwards.

I feel we're going boat COVID. Everyone (myself included) hopes there's going clear, definitive decisive end pandemic. Setting aside *want* true, best guess reality going much longer rockier transition back full normalcy. Continuing emergence new variants, new waves low vaccination areas, oscillating restrictions, localized flare-ups healthcare resource crunches still likely norm better part next year two.

My pragmatic hope we're able manage pandemic degree *level* disruption day day much less last 18 months. mutations spread contagious ones,

The fit ones. 

Fitness could immune evasion, better replication human cells, stronger membranes, whole host things related transmission contagious.

Flu viruses mutate time say they're contagious. Yeah crap lmao. increase 1 2 greater 2 3. still number still worrying. like optimism, sub want listen anything contrary. Depends measure. fair enough. ""One of"" would better say. I've seen anywhere #1 #9 different indices. eventually stop supporting basically scrubbed benefit concerts outspoken support AIDS denialism history. never recanted knowledge.

So little cutting covid denialists amount slack? Indians people India traveling back forth country Delta variant running rampant‚Ä¶ would assume told people trials take anything could accurately track side effects. I‚Äôm asking understand general relationship two metrics. think people need stop focusing breakthrough cases proving anything. Chances are, things ""fully normal"" see breakthrough cases often. still consider vaccine trials done time world literally socially distancing wearing mask. course, world returns normal, going see breakthrough cases. main thing vaccine supposed prevent hospitals getting insanely full death. Unfortunately, people get COVID get shitty symptoms getting fully vaccinated? Yes. long die fully recover, vaccine good job. lot people vaccinated, calling idiotic call ""sensationalism."" Someone tried days ago, work them.

You may need wait, there's really advantage getting additional doses yet.  official Coronavirus UK people coronavirus go hospital. 173 people coronavirus admitted hospital 12 June 2021. 6 June 2021 12 June 2021, 1,250 admitted hospital coronavirus. **This shows increase 41.4% compared previous 7 days.** I‚Äôm exact situation. want Pfizer, don‚Äôt want take create problem. think it‚Äôs important protected variants want data supports safety different vaccines We've seen time time things spiral control quickly. Ontario saying what's big deal, we've went 200 300 ICU. Within couple months almost tripled 800. contagious, means deaths. proven media blew proportion 


And vaccine VIRUS? joke. felt bit like shit first shot absolutely nothing second. fine. Everyone different Guam beautiful, everyone visit once. weak ones giving government control. concern. daughters supposed start school August, without vaccinated. I‚Äôm definitely paying attention. makes think diminish issue? massive spike mean things worse. Florida going laugh come winter. Well Delta variant working well. That's confidence interval think time make vaccines mandatory. half population fully vaccinated? unnecessary reply. recall, seemed listen people got called pushing pseudoscience. deleted crap site started donating money science based AIDS charities. Exactly. Thank Well stance supported current trends covid cases. went memorial day weekend without national spike covid cases. trend clear, areas high vaccinations, communal spread happen. live city averaging 400 covid cases day last fall. seven day average currently 3. I'm buying ""honors system"" people like mention, never mentioned CDC, problematic. reality clear. point covid cannot easily spread communally, cannot easily overflow healthcare infrastructure, longer unknown disease. Toss notion relying honors system. reality look trends, continuing downward trend even new variant hits unvaccinated communities. even see bump memorial day weekend. Slap downvote want. giving credit people made it? Imagine downvoted phobia. Fuck people, stay safe dude. FWIW, even feel AZ vaccine all. Literally nothing.

Slight ache arm later night, that's it. think supposed spearhead this? Fauci? means non-vaccinated people risk. US, vaccine accessible anyone risk sure much concern it. sure unvaccinated people smoke cigarettes cause cancer, drive without seatbelt, etc.etc. take risks. point concerned it.   antibodies still pretty good Delta, depending caused - 88% Pfizer vaccine: - antibodies infection work well general too, found strain-specific study yet: fucked lol. numbskull. First Nations include Inuit M√©tis, whereas Indigenous does. That‚Äôs case since ‚Äò80s. may become difficult fall cases among unvaccinated people increase, causing spike demand.

UK island. able wipe covid last year reopened economy, quarantined new arrivals special hotels 2 weeks like Australia. 

I really get cases totally eradicated first lock people legally forced stay home. Problem 43% population fully vaccinated ... evenly distributed either. They've repeating surveys course pandemic, started antibody surveys early on, 80% latest update that. Lots tracking vaccine trial participants recovering patients too, obvious reasons. (Not directly area, I'm working diagnostic imaging, research isolated.) CDC recommend vaccinated individuals wear masks. suppose impasse. Indian Indigenous population, they're vulnerable? get market Based I've heard. British people simply like wearing face masks. Even prime minister press conferences without wearing face mask surprises me. 

Also uncle lives England told many large gatherings Eid May. authorities respond complaints about.

Nothing yet, surprised happens next weeks fully vaccinated travelers, given Biden seems pushing July 4th official ""reopening"" gdi laughed. Two big differences:

1) since America never locked U.K., much higher natural immunity U.K. wild infections. 

2) IMHO, important groups vaccinate 65+, diabetes/obese, 35. think U.K. made mistake going straight age‚Ä¶ 35-55 low likelihood severe disease also don‚Äôt spread much. 35 younger crowd far likely spread socializing school etc. 
IE: vaccination likely effective spread even overall %. 

We see plays goes, though. time, global society, variant x country spread country get z country way even travel x z countries low. 

Using proper naming convention actually gives better understanding origins that's actually looking for. Coronaviridae, slow mutation rate.

No, ill simple thing. yeah, want flu covid thanks. think bigger group people realize. I've heard lot stories people things like shopping relative CVS saying ""oh, get vaccine"" response form relative ""I guess so, since right here.""

Half country unvaccinated. really doubt half country hardcore anti-vaxxers. lot people going way get it.   vaccine labeled anti-vaxxer fill form. Unless pre existing complications, home births risky.

Yeap! going keep it. started 374lbs. 310. Someone extended family posted rant idiot FB who's uncomfortable vaccines they're rushed finds sketchy soooo many incentives. politely replied and, it, mentioned odd incentives crappy discourse muddies water, mean vaccines bad. rant (thankfully write it, I'm still disappointed her) says basically ""don't call anti-vax this"" lol OK. hope listen moron much. society US anti-intellectual, people fucking dying Gave link tho could say someone constantly washes hands. saying disagree you, article NatGeo (not exactly fringe publication) cites people medical field.

You stop wearing shoes like ancestors, they're way difficult put cloth. wearing shoes, might well stop driving cars *and* breathing air. Oh think crossed wires. thought 22 80+.

My bad. think also meant read article. problem part still high number people infected worldwide. lot people infected means lot potential mutation happen. lot mutation means high chance one mutation makes vaccines ineffective likely. Europe US see countries get many vaccines soon possible. help them, also protects us. want wear mask, don't, get mad people doing. away masks has, predictably, done nothing vaccination rate. still wear one set example encourage people still wearing them. anyway work. thought meant 80+?

The CFR never 20%.   Yes percent higher, amount lower. I‚Äôm say think extremely cool you, British person underlying condition got AZ part regular rollout grateful! study look older data, current date [case steadily going up. sure whether exponential, going up. despite 40% fully vaccinated.  probably never useless. People original SARS shown high level protection COVID-19, nearly similar Delta original strain. could take years decades mutations vaccine effective. long don‚Äôt release identifiable info, tend fine.

The context also taken account. Sharing info details happened amongst medical professionals clearly public good. Yes, do, vaccinated mean 0% chance infected (which myth refer to). enough reason make people doubt vaccines really work.

Should become probable explanation (the direction travel suggests might well happen) consequences would enormous. KABUL -The COVID-19 pandemic spiralling control Afghanistan, cases rising 2,400% past month, hospitals filling medical resources quickly running out, International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies said Thursday.

More third tests last week came back positive, IFRC said.

‚ÄúAfghanistan crisis point battle contain COVID-19 hospital beds full capacity capital Kabul many areas,‚Äù said Nilab Mobarez, Acting President Afghan Red Crescent Society, statement released International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies.

The surge putting intense strain country millions already live poverty health resources scarce.

Health authorities Thursday registered 2,313 positive cases record 101 deaths COVID-19 last 24 hours. Officials experts said low testing means official figures probably dramatic undercount.

Afghanistan‚Äôs fragile health system damaged decades war. Violence risen recent months, U.S.-led foreign forces withdrawing September peace negotiations Afghan government insurgent Taliban largely stalled.

Major hospitals closed doors week new COVID-19 patients influx cases left lack beds oxygen shortages.

The IFRC warned lack vaccine access hesitancy exacerbating situation. Less 0.5% Afghans fully vaccinated.

Around 700,000 doses China‚Äôs Sinopharm vaccine arrived country last week, allowing authorities start next round vaccination campaign.

The IFRC working Afghan authorities provide resources try boost medical oxygen production, according Necephor Mghendi, head Afghanistan Country Delegation IFRC.

‚ÄúMore international support needed help win race virus, save thousands lives,‚Äù said. LOL mean, seems like whole lot people still getting vaxxed place. would probably make difference US, clearly they're trying schemes. one cares fixing it, read comments. They're openly wishing death disease people.

Good luck. Still 1 dose vaccination mild symptoms? don‚Äôt like wherever variant headed. thought thing peaked evolution something like IIRC. Number people hospital No, daily hospitalizations, back middle April levels now. increases 40% next week, hospitalizations back levels start April. even 10% bad back start January. 

But think data shows cases lead hospitalizations. % cases get hospitalized lower now, exponential rise cases still lead exponential rise hospitalizations.

Insurance companies still problem cover costs unvaccinated people end hospitals ICU without harming profits.

Would allowed raise prices equally everyone offer discounts people FDA authorized Covid-19 vaccinations?

Or raise prices allow vaccinated unvaccinated share financial burden equally? honestly surprising all. don‚Äôt see read statement decided anxious needed ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. Next you‚Äôll tell people hospitalized COVID contact someone COVID‚Ä¶ 19 deaths today, potentially starting rise. Hopefully rise sharply, elderly double vaccinated. herd immunity argument tested hesitant found one poorest performers. starters, difficult understand. understand it, many people obvious conclusion need get vaccinated everyone else already herd immunity protect too, people things direct personal benefit suckers. might recognize idea original anti-vaccine controversy MMR vaccine: child protected measles herd immunity, risk autism?

Many people simply care putting everyone else danger. That's problem. responsibility one else. We're together country; we're own. agree it, certainly understand it.

So changed tactics. Protect family getting vaccinated. don't, risking life, die fault. one going make it, one's going protect way. make choice.

Both arguments valid, one actually gets people get shot. mandated? find hard believe literally 100% choose anything uniformly.

No, they're really not. meaningful way. sure discouraging pregnant people getting vaccine, happen Washington State. wife got vaccine January pregnant recommendations doctors. entirely foreseeable. never gone ahead Olympics first place. No, someone cautious like assume. I've two doses Pfizer since April thankfully. matter vaccine get, 1 dose good enough delta variant.

in fact double jabbed, AZ (over 50s) - data shows they're infected. shit Sherlock might wrong, huge disclaimer: know mostly speculative information I've read internet handful anecdotal evidence.

Anyway, one theories, think, natural immunity obviously offer protection, may protect well vaccines variants. existing vaccines target spike protein - also happens virus's way cells. spike protein mutates much, renders virus useless.

On hand, natural immunity may may target spike protein. bodies may find another part virus attack. totally successful. However, part mutates spike protein remains unchanged, reinfection occur.

Again, know Reddit full bunch experts (and pedants), way qualified discuss things. I'm merely summarizing parroting facts various things I've read internet. conspiracy harm you.

Hope helps. think reason way breakthrough risk keeps reported - taking number breakthrough cases dividing number people vaccinated. horrible way this, number increase, unlike efficacy much accurate way gauge much vaccines protect you.

I personally feel CDC many politicians purposefully encouraged incorrect math correcting makes vaccines seem way better - already very, good. However, downside losing trust long term people figure math skewed, also people put trust vaccines should. can't count number times recently subreddit read keep wearing masks get vaccinated, bad antivaxxer following science, reality science says vaccines protect 66-95%, incredibly good, maybe ditch protections immediately good. would carefully worded, legitimate reasons vaccinated, sure insurance companies would jump chance increase *their* premiums. 

I'm fairly sure smoking never medically necessary. Also gonna need age comorbidity patients give crap.

US still averaging 350 daily deaths though, 10x UK per capita. Even allowing lag, something add reported case numbers US. That's guess well. UK giving vaccine based level risk, able offer vaccines lowest risk groups yet. Additionally, UK reports deaths ""Patient positive test died within x days positive test"" rather assessing cause death.

Argentina Colombia, currently positive infection rates 500/1mil, freely enter US minimal restrictions.

Why create standard constitutes acceptable rate infection (say, 40/1mil US currently sits at), allow countries regardless geographical location in, based rate infection?

It's complicated... everyone vaccinated, instance children could still possibly get disease. might others unhealthy get vaccine. lots people aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet, haven‚Äôt able get appointment (due working schedules, language barriers, lack transportation). I‚Äôve seen issues pharmacy. I‚Äôm personally excited wear mask, I‚Äôm totally OK diabetic coworker still going wear mask. That's great hear Poland well. impression mostly stalled due hesitancy. guess incentives motivating people enough? seem promising. hope start retooling production facilities make biontech/pfizer vaccine. know right??? much better mask...üòÇüòÇ Social distancing happened. Right?

It‚Äôs tens thousands people over, mixing together elevators, bars, restaurants, movie theaters, clubs going back homes little bonus.

Outside own, fine.

But it‚Äôs own. Reddit... happens one thing say would change mind, constantly evaluating risk vs reward keeping open mind. extreme end - vaccine causing health problems seem worse virus tangible level would certainly make decision probably get vaccine. vaccine went standard approval process hold vaccines experts field deemed important steps process track record longer time think would much easier decision go get it. easy decision me, sucks caught middle. worked high touch point environment like grocery store nurse 70s, think would already got vaccine. balance risk case, black white decision many. fact cases still decreasing Ireland quite promising though, since far closest links UK. government public health officials seem concerned it, overly seem confident vaccination rollout able outpace it. Germany vaccines also doctors' offices (hence mess record keeping), stupid idea ever ask me, since enabled tons nepotism, people good contacts doctors (mostly rich people, since primary care poorer areas underdeveloped Germany), people higher priority still waiting vaccine. 

Also, Chaos Computer Club urging decent analogue solution hard forge vaccine stickers holograms stuff, would solved problem much elegantly importantly, could already deployed January, since much simpler thinking negotiating requirements digital vaccine passport. race finish together. **Now US population vaccinated first**

FTFY. fine though, live US  think misunderstood I've said. assumed said bats known reservoirs SARS-like corona viruses. One advantage US might young people vaccinated could slow transmission somewhat since generally socialise within age group. Accident not, totally took advantage opportunity conduct trial run. I'd put money round 2 years road. Also, I'm worried ancient dormant viruses bacteria revived ice caps melt. make sense vaccinate twice people giving two doses person 3X effective. 

Even since two-doses would targeted vulnerable. really thought would name sub lineages Delta-1, Delta-2, etc

Why make sound scarier Same. hospitalization rate increased. Yikes, think unapproved substance government mandated, that's slippery slope give evidence that? Like, really recent evidence, since Delta variant took over? 100% agree, lotta ugly people there. Hopefully always socially acceptable now. fun Disney! Vesicular stomatitis vector actually done, Ebola vaccine. Measles interesting one. wonder neither worked. Today person 6: wearing mask, feeling terribly guilty seeing others masked up! agree. messaging America made sound like vaccine magic shield too. It‚Äôs frustrating.

I exposed fully vaccinated elderly relative came mother-in-law‚Äôs house host symptoms could lot things, including covid. didn‚Äôt share fever us already sitting poorly ventilated small room several hours. situation alone enough trigger lot problems us work, asked get rapid covid test (at expense, free her). refused insisted vaccination makes covid impossible. Incredibly frustrating. 

She go hospital pissed gave covid test... waste money, blah blah blah. negative (which reinforced stubbornness), people don‚Äôt believe breakthroughs happen then, top that, don‚Äôt believe spread covid despite nasty cough unpleasant symptoms. 

I guess people can‚Äôt handle shades gray. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  please start taking blue checks away hyperbolists grifters please: beyond parody now. We‚Äôve got doctors calling permanent social isolation basically, stay uninfected.

At least, rational medical experts need start calling folks name BS. day mask rule ended state dude store told ‚Äútake fucken mask off‚Äù told mind business got nervous walked away. idiot shoots back? sure wear mask? hilarious much money Pharmaceutical companies get US government, yet charge ridiculous prices medicine whatever increase bonuses executives all. even spin shareholders? 

""Why increase executives bonuses?""

""Because got billion dollars government vaccine created yet sure gonna work."" umm, what? 

To knowledge, booster shots yet. even saying? Here's I'd instead. First I'd coordinate government making announcement ensure much masks available consumer sale diverted front-line workers. I'd go say full-stop masks necessary. I'd start effort make EVERYONE wants them. Remember government gave millions loans - advocate publicly setting aside $10 million jumpstart new mask production. 

Doing might've angered Trump administration, job scientists tell harsh truths. Even would've gotten fired this, might've spurred people start making masks own. would've call action. Delta included got Pfizer first moderna?  Yeah UK going win cause barely antivaxxers people can't bothered.  Bet hated Flu Fighters warm act. truth everyone wants one vaccinated us, going Stand bad anyone agrees lockdown again. Uneducated douche waffles nothing better force beliefs onto others Hydroxychloriquine? J/k Scandinavian countries still included. Finland well last heard, might removed long ago.  accepted anti-vax people selfish. say others 100% anti vaccine mentality.  made choice thinks them. COVID 100% sure helps protect also helps protect others.  Even .00000001% (not saying is) chance could save life wouldn‚Äôt free less! 

 Sadly pandemic shaken faith 1/2 humanity. started anti maskers got worse. It‚Äôs shame damn shame. right thank you. selfish a-holes grow up. Decent gaslight joke. [Right Couple viral-vector vaccines poor stage 1 results. Interestingly using adenovirus vectors, measles vesicular stomatitis virus vectors. EU countries long updated plans without Curevac. importantly vaccinated yet. (not anti-vax turn yet) bummer, glad guys generally ok. ... vaccines work? experience like? Planning traveling next month (fully vaccinated). things still open accessible? so? think opinion short sighted irresponsible. 
 Companies can't really verify someone vaccinated. trust say. yet vaccinated, medically cannot get vaccinated, they're forced trust randoms sharing space near liars. peace mind simple courtesy others, hardly inconveniences slightest. matter. belief manmade gives lot people comfort. China never going allow real investigation, whether actually behind not. without proof, people going change minds. Even smoking gun found Chinese cave, people going believe China fabricated it.

We move on. option?

Apply yourself.  doubting that, happening (in EU). many compromises, little competence judging actually matters.

Also, time go policy would March 2020. time more. time ""screw it, let's get many people vaccinated possible autumn live rest consequences"" strategy. damage done already anyways. Finding SARS-COV-2 specific bat species like finding needle stack needles. took nearly 20 years find Chimpanzee virus closely related HIV. Ebola emerged nearly 50 years ago recently filoviruses isolated bats, Ebola specifically. many many virus emerged humans one knows species emerged. take finding SARS-COV-2 bats year half sign anything. there's truly vaccine-resistant variant start somebody else.

I'm sure that's going happen, also nobody convinced can't happen I'd willing wear mask solely spite anyway. Great info, thanks taking time share figures. Completely agree r.e. London aspect well news inbound air travelers US longer need COVID test within 72 hours flight departure? sound like guy would deny pandemic US back last year lived warning it, didn't.

I wish best people India hope take things control.

\- Ron White Yeah definitely. uptake vaccine adults high, much higher US overall think, 11-12 week delay (and guess lack supply) delta Variant stopped us bring able reopen full yjust yet. Israel gotten 85% adult population vaccinated, quite high number. believe they're beginning vaccinate children now, make much larger proportion population countries. tried find Wikipedia effectiveness J&amp;J delta variant, there, quite possible nobody knows yet. gonna keep coming new variants tokeep people fear control   Nope. apply special exemption US embassy home country, person id leave US first. guarantee I'd yet special exemption long would take, since embassies swamped. option stay 15 nights country outside schengen. Many people using places like Serbia Mexico.

On non-residency visa (like J, H1B O), basically better tourists regard even though live pay taxes US.

I havent able see family since march 2020 travel ban, really frustrating. Particularly biden administration keeps saying ""we follow science"", meanwhile travel bans countries much higher covid case rates. incredibly arbitrary tied actual metrics. Thankfully, lot noise made hopefully gets lifted soon. think yet Germany yet, unfortunately. 

It fortunately. higher uptake taking longer get younger adults much preferable prolonged pandemic. Look words educate yourself.

...are joking? read link sent?

It literally explains efficacy effectiveness measure compares vaccinated population *control group*. Okay far go young people starting fill hospitals, plus within everyone's interest reduce number cases occur virus chance mutate.

Every time fucker reproduces another step towards virulent strain - even zero people getting seriously ill still imperative keep virus penned in. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve able find I‚Äôve gotten J&amp;J I‚Äôm protected don‚Äôt need anything else.

Furthermore, would done unusual secrecy, lab published papers, abstracts, RNA sequences virus period 8 years since isolation alleged progenitor (even though going progenitor current CoV2 would require 6-fold acceleration evolution, feat would worthy major paper). virus escape would require sloppiness shocking negligence. story hang together accidental escape pathogen undergoing ordinary research. think accept lab-leak hypothesis (and think evidence it) can't square mere ""sloppiness"".

In event, almost everybody pushing theory high levels clear intent making pandemic appear malignant act Chinese. wonder salvaged higher ug... beach I've gone to, bars restaurants beach (nice sit places land-side beach strip excluded) huge outdoor seating areas, ""indoor"" seating mostly open free flowing breeze. literal definition strawman argument. Hospital workers lot consider covid.  That‚Äôs make gin it‚Äôs usually fine. Old axiom, ‚ÄúGod help help themselves‚Äù. like think covers question willful stupidity.  Better question: get it? chances getting sick vaccine far lower chances getting sick Covid, worry passing vulnerable person, everyone stop judging getting vaccinated. Seems like vaccines really job! month past trough cases minimal increase hospitalizations/no measurable change deaths thus far. Think could first look outbreaks post-vaccination world like: something doctors public leaders keep eye on, something drives much change behavior and/or adverse health outcomes. 47% bad first vaccine market. 
A bit head scratcher much worse Pfizer Moderna, though. Variants can't explain everything (I hope!). kids get vaccinated, appreciate everyone still wearing masks whether vaccinated not. Didn‚Äôt Merck two different candidates failed early?  medically statistically possible country claim 90% asymptomatic cases among tested? Asking numbers released health agency seem fishy. (I'll say country later.) understand. I'd guess talking Germany? Germans handled pandemic better, stricter measures. quite lax measures never really ""cared"" almost 18,000 people died according official count (which undercount btw). would accept letting go masks much earlier Germany (NL much higher level cases currently Germany). stop? obvious new variants keep popping frequently on, arrivals UK vaccinated let in. going open/closed borders cycle every time new variant appears? Accept risks stop madness. I'm due get mine next week, we'll see happens! First dose absolutely nothing sore arm I'm preparing worst second one. mean word faction? Like factions nobility medieval sense/aristocracy? group like minded people? ! answer definitive no. Ah fuck. didn‚Äôt fever chills all. felt tired, little sore back shoulders, hungry. husband says felt absolutely nothing except slightly sore injection site. Everyone reacts little differently. nobody know side effects day.  know, soon thread began actually texted someone say much regret username sometimes hahaha. Y‚Äôall never take alive. Astra Zeneca effective space 8-12 weeks. MRNA 3-4 weeks.  (At least told Canada). 33% effective vs. 88% effective (Delta variant, 90% UK's cases).

Which countries going forward might want this. looked CFR delta variant, though? It‚Äôs dramatically lower wild type 5,000 variants previously discovered, symptoms much less virulent even flu. Suggesting virus mutate become transmissible possible; suggesting evade vaccines transmissible highly unlikely; suggesting become transmissible dangerous absurd. afraid reaction. informed without afraid. I'd hope so. certain areas age group mostly unvaccinated, help regions. side, relatively young people vaccinated, means relatively less older/vulnerable people vaccinated, might mean less cases beginning, eventually whole lot hospitalisations deaths. 

Let's hope waves caused delta variant lower terms cases compared waves almost nothing terms hospitalisations deaths compared waves. selfishly got vaccine wanted go stuff without killing family (which selfishly don‚Äôt want die). Join J&amp;J brotherhood guys care way much others doing. I‚Äôll continue mask stores, planes, pharmacies, anywhere else commonly picked bugs. Yes I‚Äôm vaccinated also don‚Äôt like colds. don‚Äôt find uncomfortable illness doesn‚Äôt need deadly avoid  remember 'Newt' Lonesome Dove, excitedly getting 'first whore.' ¬†

I guess back 'known anti-vaxxer whore frequenter.' It‚Äôs shit used buy basic needs. Adults realize it‚Äôs unlimited paper  Exactly this. Thanks putting clearly. I'm seeing 1,077 currently hospitalized vs. recent trough 896, pandemic low 828, all-time peak 38,429. suppose ""minimal"" subjective word, I'm going stand light figures. Thank you. makes comfortable Los Angeles wide open.

Let games begin. yet‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt wear masks regularly covid‚Ä¶? Ugh. even *been* breakthrough cases vaccinated teenagers? get 15 once, wants go art camp valuable teenager life experience. risk/benefit analysis ‚Äúsend kid art camp, FFS.‚Äù Would lab leak scientist cave catch bat spread people? Biological agents made China outlawed TW. Bringing needs legislative changes legislator would want touch that. 

I understand business groups want it, one‚Äôs standing way want fly get vaccinated. type exact statement Google, give dozen sites answer question. Yeah quite common thing, first confirmed UK covid death occurred way first UK confirmed positive. Thanks governor DeSantis left Florida half passengers vaccinated, made law can't make vaccination policies, would spread like wild fire. flu died completely Covid made through?

To take question face value, though think pushing stupid agenda, seasonal flu R0 around 1.5. original COVID R0 around 2.5 - 3.5. Alpha likely around 4 Delta around 6. Measure knock 2/3 transmissions (distancing, masks, etc.) put flu's R well 1, flu dies out. Original COVID gets knocked around 1, there's still slow burn transmission. measures, Alpha transmits like unmitigated flu Delta transmits like unmitigated OG COVID. degree magically make someone smart capable complex thought. means they've followed particular steps acceptable degree.

I know many brilliant folks without degrees, idiots degrees. reverse well.  couple waves crazy unusual flue like symptoms go work December February.  People commented unusual was, even started bringing hand sanitizer work.  work lot international sales folks frequently traveling various hot spots.

I know covid. never heard anything. wonder. hyperbole embarrassing. ""Cowering fear."" understand 600,000 people dead many idiots refused acknowledge reality, correct? Cowering fear got us point recovery. Stepping up, adults, respecting inherent dangers deadly virus is.

No one said anything ""more deadly"" variants popping up. Delta variant already here, 60% virulent Alpha, known affect vaccinated people, likely become dominant strand USA within next two months.

That's reality. Wearing masks, even CDC said masks unnecessary unvaccinated people, help contribute fewer deaths, sicknesses, hospitalizations going forward. That's reality.

Torture often involves decision give torturer want suffer pain. Telling someone tell want hear, get water boarded. still choice, much choice one things extremely even stupid think making decision extreme physical harm even remotely comparable

Decisions often result extreme physical harm. think 10 years American prison extreme physical harm, idea prison trial charge risking penalties. Again, completely irrelevant plea deal is.

No, not. another cases [they put man death likely innocent refused take plea admit Black represented public defender racist state time. state killed man refusing admit guilt, crime likely commit, refused confess it. That's logic would better force innocent person decide 5 years prison vs 10, instead 2 years probation vs 10 prison. That's completely illogical. rational decision innocent person goes trial gets found guilty time all. case that's problem.

An innocent person would feel pressured accept plea crime commit disparity penalties large, actual criminals get slap wrist. guy danger society never offered anything less prison, that's crime deserved. wild disparity sentence offered plea deal, would get trial problem.

Courts always going get outcome right. innocent person accused crime knows that, take consideration deciding whether accept plea. right stupid take plea, problem would true regardless guilt.

Variants already emerged able partly escape immunity due spike protein mutations. particular concern delta variant, taking hold UK despite fairly widespread vaccination (admittedly, yet reached herd immunity). 

As another example, Canada, we've relied delayed-dose schedule give many people possible first vaccination, delta variant great concern because, much greater degree widespread variants, single dose vaccine relatively ineffective stopping infection. 

Granted, we're still fortunate fully vaccinated either mRNA vaccines still provides excellent protection every existing VOC. know clinical trials confirming it. Every time new VOC spreads, collectively breathe sigh relief data published showing vaccines still quite effective (if slightly less before), possibility always exists new VOC emerging escapes immunity greater degree. 

As far alpha (UK) delta (Indian) variants go, wreak havoc place like Canada, example, might moderately successful public health interventions, emerged countries huge numbers people became infected due overly lax public health interventions. token, areas world limited vaccine uptake limited vaccine supply going continue seeing widespread circulation Covid-19, potentially going generate new variants pose genuine threat even places relatively high vaccine uptake.

So far beta (South African) variant shown greatest degree vaccine escape, taken hold outside SA quite infectious alpha delta variants, recall correctly. matter degree, foolish dismiss concern, VOCs like alpha delta surprisingly infectious virulent, incredibly damaging. allowing large virus pools remain human population, we're virtually guaranteeing new, dangerous variants emerge future. idea anti-vaxxers harming incredibly foolish. included Swedish plan, due manufacturing issues well doses actually expected.

America never issue people wearing masks either?

Both countries fair share idiots unfortunately. 

Disclaimer: wear masks. wear twelve hours day job. think do. I'm traveling Spain need either vaccination test Covid recovery. That's one country, I'd imagine similar across union. Statistically, 35-55 tiny percentage deaths compared 60+

And, two ways solving problem, one reduce number cases, reduce severity cases. There's ""sacrificing"" strategy results lower overall spread.

Considering that, far, USA seen uptick cases UK has, fact vaccinated younger people might important factor.

Note, I'm 38 (and vaccinated), like I'm talking benefit. really care 80s, shit scares me, yet people! anti Vax special level stupid can‚Äôt get mind around. Hospitals, shops, people breaking law, airports still open new arrivals. Many many places transmission still occur. That's game plan since beginning. Look way back March ""mask diplomacy"".  


The CCP asked world keep donations PPE January February down-low, demanded nations praise shipments PPE coming China March April 2020. mean virus slowly losing possible hosts infect long vaccines keep working matter time. Well guess I'm going pin hopes medicago sanofi's shots now. Parts anti vaccine scene cult, spitting fud lies way ""evangelize"" religion.

They small minority loud forums social media.

From people know real life one person remotely like that. No. still effect you. bad face masks, sure odd wear people genuinely exempt I'd argue pretty good.

I found regarding different dosing times az. Honestly didn‚Äôt know recommendations changed. haven‚Äôt paid ton attention az since never got approval US. 

I‚Äôd like see lot data believe 12 weeks actually superior. Here‚Äôs big issue:

They start measuring efficacy starting 2 weeks dose 2. doesn‚Äôt matter interval 4 weeks 12 weeks.

This necessarily confound results. 12 weeks better, protection 2 doses continue build several weeks longer measured? example‚Ä¶

Dose 2 given 4 weeks group a. 12 weeks group b. start measuring infections week 14 groups, would actually difference? group b getting infections gap 6-12 weeks could prevented shortened interval?

I went sources found indication received vaccines shorter interval reevaluated order fairly compare 12 week interval subjects. fact states limitation study initial studies never designed glean information. mutations spike protein. Based we‚Äôve seen nearly eliminating flu common cold probably masking. problem theory assumes outcomes within hospital systems same, overall population risk same.

Both may may true. I'd suspect lower mortality rate per case USA variety reasons (Average Vitamin deficiency, hospital beds, etc) -- I'm theorizing hoenstly. 35-55 *much* higher risk younger adults hospitalization death. age range fears ""needing"" go barhopping socializing much, sacrificed go last? makes damn sense. US, age range accounts ""fair share"" COVID cases. Lots older adults kids (I'm 41 2 year old) schools daycares work suffered highest non-self-brought-on risks entire time. 44.1% population, 51.6% 12+, 54.8% 18+.  Yep. get infected fully vaccinated end hospital dying vaccine still working. Covid big deal kill people.  academic, it‚Äôs really frustrating seeing media outlets rejig studies fit one sentence headline Could also help tackling problem antibiotic resistant bacteria? Yet article discuss delta variant. agree fact we‚Äôre never going go full lockdown year. thought Fauci said 70% country‚Äôs population vaccinated order pandemic end US. know close think wait see happens. Sure not. üòä third thing favor US nobody really talking about, major population centers highest rate vaccinations (with exceptions). difficult spread US small towns 25% cities 60-80% vaccinated. remember hearing early last year. watching covid since January.  I'd also heard lab studying initial area. ideas definitely public. 

I bought extra mega pack toilet paper January, buying extra meal two week since untilthe lockdowns started March. probably noticed quicker average person. live CA issues wildfires smoke. bit precaution minorly preparing disruption seemed pretty reasonable. 

I get people gung-ho blaming someone.  Bad things happen time one really blame. suppose nature need control. are... roughly 400% increase new COVID cases UK compared 30 days ago. guess agreeing concerned variant, there's way would missed UK cases reading article, right? Unfortunately, like COVID general, hits hard, means it‚Äôll hit us vaccinated folk hard, too. 

But otherwise agreed. Fuck em.  rna one imperial college vaccine. actually idea stopped. Nobody lives California anymore, crowded Got anything read this? .. president's magical amulet? What‚Äôs point, delta originally hoping 60% effectiveness COVID Hahahah fuck let‚Äôs kill completely false hope company goes bankrupt  gay ass band I‚Äôm wondering same! dont care anymore Fix fucked education system instead wanting shun half society.  Another sane Alabamian here. Wanna friends? Same, everyone self-wishing dare say anything else. Saying make over. virus keep viruses do. think US doomed another bad Fall surge, sooner. low % vaccinated many places, absolutely zero precautions anymore (it's one huge damn COVID party CA since yesterday I'll risk exposure work since masks phased workplaces too), new variant breaks vaccine more. definitely nowhere close required herd immunity, even vaccinated states, something transmissible B.1.617.2. Welp, since vacation season probably get full swing, summer definitely put concept vaccine test. got mine May, people itching get theirs. assume it‚Äôs hit miss go feels like states it‚Äôs basically don‚Äôt get vaccine. Hopefully cases get unvaccinated possibly made hospital time room spare.

We top vaccines like hopefully still flu current/future worry Covid similar flu something new comes along. busted leg even cancel Dave.

And bitches afraid vaccine. also take flight Buffalo drive across border staying hotel. 
Also I‚Äôm fully vaccinated quarantine PM. one shot needs provide negative test

Side note co worker came
Back India. picture guy selling fake negative covid tests gate  Yes, sir. I'm sure that. Pfizer come Belgium, AZ Europe?

""Canada purchased 20 million AstraZeneca doses coming U.S. Another two million sent Serum Institute India another 1.9 million COVAX, global vaccine sharing network designed assist mostly middle low-income countries.""

AZ doses 1.8M covishield (AZ India) around 425K 6 June.

Canada received loan 1.5M USA, 500K India, Korea provide come (600K) COVAX.

I think USA supplied initial loan would cover around 300K gap.

Unlikely Canada need anywhere near numbers AZ. looking offer mRNA vaccine 2nd shot got AZ first dose want anymore. I‚Äôm similar position trip booked Canada Italy October. hope we‚Äôre able go! Yes weeks left slow spread flatten curve stop calling pandemic global transmission stops. Excuse me, used word ""fuck"" directed fellow user, come now. Same. first started wearing mask fire CA, basically wore one every time plane feeling slightly ill. they've normalized, plan wear one whenever hell feel like. nice getting sick year. care retribution actual problem front us? one suggesting lock whatsoever. Yeah, that‚Äôs basically it. Small sample size, occurrences seizure means doctor condone getting vaccine. fortunately live today‚Äôs world, safe still enjoy life. Food delivery, streaming shows like make bad. international travel market basically dead despite countries opening US tourists. way hell I‚Äôm traveling internationally climate. Paul George good start Clippers. He's going need channel inner Jordan carry Utah. probably protection, guaranteed much protection vaccine. Single doses hurt full doses variation. states shit show waiting happen high unvaccinated rates. Really hope people open eyes, honestly, do-omers telling everybody world going end like march 2020 probably desensitized lot people it. mess around, end, everyone responsible personal choices. lead horse water, etcetc.

Wow chat filters testy here. Yeah one seems big one regards. make sense. governments universally favor citizens get vaccines political act. members community do.  Fully vaxxed still wearing mine. I'm concerned new variants seem popping every day now. really, ridiculously mild inconvenience wearing never really bothered me. Erm, yes is. 

All vulnerable fully vaccinated, within weeks 40's fully vaccinated ages 18 - 40 least 1 jab. people even slightest risk 18 - 40 year olds virtually 0 risk death anyway 1 dose give least 40% protection Delta variant top.

How exactly working well? son‚Äôs great uncle Catholic priest apparently kicked shit woman trying pick pocket train station. I‚Äôm guessing pretty shocked well. everyone US, UK Canada. make sense US. short time supply limited time low case rates. 

It also looks like make sense going forward Delta variant. Got first Moderna shot Monday day yesterday felt like edge death. COVID last July chills/fatigue felt eerily similar! delta plus resistent antibody cocktail using normal covid. can't post link otherwise bot deletes post since times india. also even transmissible Delta strain. So, really proves nothing, sound good.

Thanks reassurance though lol.

Edit: Oh mean antibodies vaccinations. mean literally catching covid like ""I'm safe"" lot people want believe that. antibodies I'm talking about, idea science behind this. I'm certainly Neanderthal tries research stuff available. said everyone would eligible shot June 1st reached goal early. don‚Äôt manufacturing power make vaccines contracts manufacturers home countries strict deals. Trump one originally made deal US wouldn‚Äôt give Canada extras pop significantly vaccinated. countries sort contract take half long bats (especially cave dwelling ones) live extremely communal life. feel like watched bunch islanders die though...hmmm...  US, vaccine available practically everyone 12, risk. That‚Äôs people feel America vaccination rates almost capped out. want get jabbed, it‚Äôs available weeks. could be? know Coronavirus spreads exponentially first introduced vulnerable population one masked socially-distant late 2019 early 2020. virus spread like wildfire? literally said feds stupid don‚Äôt believe shutting air travel  Reasons heard week patients 
Ex 1:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs safe, I‚Äôll wait it‚Äôs FDA approved‚Äù
‚ÄúAlmost billion people gotten safely, approved next weeks walk day‚Äù
‚ÄúBut heavy metals‚Äù
‚ÄúI give list ingredients, heavy metals‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, take garlic extract every morning haven‚Äôt sick year‚Äù

Ex 2:
‚ÄúIm vaccines man‚Äù
‚ÄúIve seen flu shot last several years, tetanus, hepatitis shots‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks I‚Äôm okay‚Äù Yes - that‚Äôs we‚Äôre #1 vaccinated country world?  Masking pretty much done America. Everyone desperate party. Never women approach shows bar prepandemic. Eh. heard extract news stories regarding UK variant back March, yet are. Yeah, mask symbol now. People want shed it, done covid. personally wear protect me(Sorry sound selfish, wearing masks CDC said to, trying protect people, I'm tired giving shit people want damn thing help others) people care infecting unvaxxed two young kids. They're still pretty shut in, although go park not. Go places/or times lot people. lot knowledge safe year ago.

I wish people would wear masks, stopped like three days ago literally one stores/public spaces. I'm helping wearing it, fools vaccinated(Live Ohio like half first shot). I'm around anyone that's unvaxxed pretty much time that's store. That's them, Idgaf.

I'm glad still caring person, whole shitshow definitely restarted nihilism. Early pandemic definitely people felt fearful. elderly in-laws did. last summer think mostly settled
Itself haven‚Äôt heard anyone express anything like fear long time, even among elderly. everyone reason fear vaccinated long ago. original comment places blame Trudeau govt indian diaspora. everyone vaccinated one reason. vaccinated get exposed virus won‚Äôt get sick still circulate bodies still spread others. shedding virus would less compared non vaccinated people still do. 

Social distancing, wearing masks reduce chance spreading others carrying virus unwittingly. useful directing fear hatred towards certain group people, sure. went store employees wear masks customers didn‚Äôt. still wore mine. to, well. use S-2P mutation [mRNA CureVac applied mRNA technology rapid development CVnCoV, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine designed maximal protein expression balanced immune activation. CVnCoV comprised lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated, non-chemically modified, sequence engineered mRNA encoding full length protein two proline mutations (S-2P). mutations stabilize protein conformation previously reported MERS-CoV (Pallesen et al., 2017) SARS-CoV (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018). ‚Ä¶Ha-ha! keep saying die get vaccinated fucking fault now. rest rational people got vaccinated time put BS. Sounds like healthy skill developed. land border - moment - closed other‚Äôs citizens, except commercial traffic.

But fly. Read back. said ""I wish US done back Feb/March"" said ""That make sense."" LOL never get vaccine. ethnic foods deadly eat say ‚Äúok see it‚Äôs traveling‚Äù.

unless gets plane. I‚Äôm worried kids Agreed. article reads like, recommending giving vaccine 18s risk. used terms like moral ethical debates giving kids, making sound like good thing vaccinate kids.   It‚Äôs people angry mask mandates. claimed it‚Äôs freedom choice, truth they‚Äôre shitty people.  better worse, least anecdotal experience coming home Mexico, you‚Äôre going test positive they‚Äôre tests.  Concidering even Pfizers vaccine, yes indeed. someone (my mom) confirmed case Covid-19 last year refuses vaccine, still risk Delta variant? got antibody test thinks protected doesn‚Äôt need vaccine. mean, probably right still, NJ high number deaths COVID suggests there's high amount natural immunity baked anyway. There's like around 12% confirmed cases number probably higher considering testing limited early on. think definitely seen uptick Fall think worst days behind us terms COVID. It‚Äôs like cases continuing drop worldwide, vaccinations going arms worldwide (even though slower paces others), vaccines cover variants.

There article spread recently ‚Äú**EVERY PERSON HOSPITAL COVID ONE THING COMMON**‚Äù making big scare title, actually read article it‚Äôs 3 people hospital COVID.

These articles taken seriously start getting news variants escaping vaccines don‚Äôt need worrying. I'm one keeps trying tell that! NEEEEEERRRRRRDS!!!! ...shocking... terms really take lesson listen learning something new. bigger deal people think reason it‚Äôs big deal all. fact continues spread reinfect means continues mutate. randomly mutates higher probability it‚Äôs going become something longer handle. Yes, talking two different points time. know can't grasp concept. That's Foxconn trying do. Buy fosun ship Taiwan. 

The main problem idea logical one Tsai repeatedly said refuse fosun vaccine. likely banned used public healthcare. Unfortunately, recent meeting, FDA seems determined emergent need kids younger 12 get vaccinated. talked lot kids get sick would allow EUA would like least 6 months data larger studies consider approving vaccine kids 12. 

I really hoping process could move fairly quickly since trials started Pfizer expressed data present September. Sounds like FDA plans proceed. point comparison gp others, felt totally fine 2nd dose Moderna. pretty worried horror stories Reddit, ""no way know till know"" guess. Didn‚Äôt realize California adopting anti-vax policy provided better Always first guess vaccinated unvaccinated restaurant sections bathrooms next

Carry-out portapotties choose spread disease end thing now. Geez, hope become standard. family got Sputnik (not picked it). love Broadway planning go shows sometime fall. hope worst case scenario it'll ""present antigen test"" like 16. thoroughly unfair ""tAkE vAcCiNe gEt"" discourse going drain things reopening. much I'd love patch parents J&amp;J shot, would logistically complicated (and expensive) that.  First identified equal origin. it
Goes reddit narrative Trudeau wrong issue fact spread vaccine doses get people first vaccine dose faster? People one dose think significantly less protected variant. I'm Texas fully vaxed since...April.

The convention center ghost town day got second dose I‚Äôm vaxxed, coworkers. still wear masks customers unvaxxed maskless young kids idiot adults.

I‚Äôm going keep up, one fully vaccinated friend similar job stopped masking cold symptoms last Friday, got tested, covid. wish infect customers way (or get covid even though would likely minor symptoms). Transplant patients. Anyone HIV. Anyone allergic vaccine component. People certain genetic disorders. positivity rate continued drop, well amount testing, suggesting case counts artificially low simply due lower testing. far look large impact US Delta variant, though could still change, particularly less vaccinated areas. 

The good news, extent some, concentrated population centers also areas highest vaccination rates. Democrat run cities, Trump republicans like call them, tend vaccinated meaning denser-populated areas virus spread easiest also protected.  Immunosuppressed people used prior pandemic recall, transplant patients know. also use Indians refer people India. confused thinks Indians bringing variant. impression border's closed. border closed right now? There's supposed evidence children's vaccination data says probably take painkillers shot, probably fine. final form, Blue eyes white privilege. issue addressed study. Statistically, 1 2 9 positives could false positives. chances 9 vanishingly small. Thank posting everyday. honestly guiding light pandemic. saw going stop July 4th, wanted thank do. real MVP! lot people every day. really matter 100% americans got vaccinated. live globalised world lots air travel. 100% people vaccinated somewhere like India covid continue spread, continue mutate eventually might develop mutation makes vaccines ineffective, thereby making 100% vaccinated population vulnerable again. sources that? Tell get vaccine feel you. It‚Äôs lunacy frustrating beg countrymen get vaccinated. point, feel start shipping vaccine supply countries willing take Vaccination, took emails something, add databank?

If that's case, maybe roll retroactively? rid flu strains

Exactly. new ones immediately pop up. long seriously suggesting eternal lockdown, no, never, ever get rid COVID, never got rid flu. transmissible, escape animals - there's way. Get first vaccine Monday, super nervous getting side effects see spreading variant going cause bad problems long run wanna prepared reporting early ""no evidence"" reduce spread, ""no evidence"" really meant ""no rigorous academic studies performed test transmissibility,"" ""the vaccine stop transmission.""

Realistically, vaccine reduces severity infection makes infection less likely *also* reduce transmission.

Even vaccine, *can* still get infected, *can* get severely ill die, much less likely. article written October 2020. experience tells Americans dgaf already 'back normal'. one cares infection increasing again.  25%? Try 60-70 percent unvaccinated many places  I‚Äôll take 99%+ chance I‚Äôll fine. long time, afraid leaving house concern grandmother, lives me. bring virus home, would almost certainly die, blood would hands. one reasons don‚Äôt kill myself. *really* don‚Äôt want lose her. I‚Äôm working essential retail, far one dangerous lines work second frontline medical work regards catching virus, fears renewed amplified tenfold despite us fully vaccinated. going allow life return normal population fully vaccinated, you? 80%-90% protection good enough, nothing be. thanks, wanted second this. ""88%"" efficiency mean everybody 88% protection rate, means 88 people protected 12 (from 100). 12 cases like immunocompromised reasons lack protection. reasons resulting 12 infections 100 patients, resulting 88% (or whatever) efficiency. improve, maybe *die*

Along lot people killed stupidity key vaccinate across world, that's covax important vaccinating children West secondary getting first shots adults world wide. Fewer cases, fewer variants, longer places comprehensively unvaccinated, worse is. it‚Äôs concerted effort intelligence agencies mounted campaign undermine confidence Pfizer Inc.‚Äôs Western vaccines, using online publications recent months questioned vaccines‚Äô development safety, U.S. officials said. Alas, disease prevent reinfection, especially different strain. mean antibody base elevated, they're looking wrong thing, bind tightly :( results disappointing mRNA vaccine. Europe need vaccine anymore since CureVac delaying release data two months almost half European population least partially vaccinated. still good vaccine, maybe one need right now. second generation vaccine undoubtedly better. 

Still, final results might still show improvement efficiency:

‚ÄúWhile hoping stronger interim outcome, recognize demonstrating high efficacy unprecedented broad diversity variants challenging. continuing toward final analysis minimum 80 additional cases, overall vaccine efficacy may change,‚Äù said Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, Chief Executive Officer CureVac. ‚ÄúIn addition, variant-rich environment underlines importance developing next-generation vaccines new virus variants continue emerge.‚Äù That's great way cause civil unrest ensure stops people ever getting it. make mandatory schools government jobs, otherwise no. We're similar figure ~45% fully vaccinated, there's distributional differences course, base we're less comparable position. Even difference order magnitude, variant spreads 50% faster Alpha, 50% Covid Classic - twice aggressive aggregate. sounds pretty worrying, course R-rates exponential, like compound interest. small change escalate quickly. Sadly worry USA find out. critical US Europe vaccinate children soon possible, course Reminds show 12 monkeys We‚Äôre TVA Thats symptomatic infection. PHE report prevention hospitalisation much higher.  "" Yes, fully vaxxed wearing mask literally harms one""

In vaccinated world says ""I believe I'm infected, I'm coming anyway. Get way"". 

If believe risk emitting aerosols, leaving house. mean, bet many vaccines EU expected fail. bet many.  Denmark removed timeline plans.   understand, thought viruses natural evolution leads contagious turn usually less severe virus deadly makes difficult spread alot hosts. Everything I've read virus mutations says: contagious=less deadly. Meanwhile Canada (Ontario particular), crappy vaccination appointment system resulted #VaccineHungerGames. 

The fact people US stroll local pharmacy get it, yet choosing to, bonkers.

It's like Simpsons episode someone tells Homer one little simple thing avoid disaster, laughs says ""Nah, I'm good, nobody tells do"", calmy walks blazing inferno. wish people upvoting awarding understood producing journalistic content costs money, thus paywalls. kinda suspect maybe don‚Äôt understand this‚Ä¶. able get another vaccine, terrible efficiency likely approved anyway. Yeah. I'm EU. Pfeizer bedrock entire vaccination campaign, really hurt get ten million doses ordered, reliable suppliers. Yeah... shapes way might send wife kid back home. nice grandparents help childcare day.  One thing really eye opening see sheer amount academics Twitter perfectly okay spreading misinformation COVID long highlights seriousness disease. definitely social penalty people optimistic little people pessimistic. fact see academics social science backgrounds development arguing school closures kids secretly extremely negatively effected long COVID despite little evidence absolutely baffling. Reading Twitter feeds like alternate reality vaccines 90%+ efficiency majorities European countries least one dose. lack faith vaccines borders anti-vaxx logic. 

Of course Twitter representative academics Jesus, seems like lot people really grasp basic statistics right mean future basically concept weighting risks.  noted Covid seems far worse effect Obese difficencys Vitamins (such Vitamin D).

So really surprise affected America more. I'm participant Netherlands. got options vaccins roled out. ask deblinded decision take another vaccin dependent got curevac vaccin take vaccin te government suplies. cases continue trial, need let know vaccin got.

So still get another vaccin. lying? Spanish Flu today shown H1N1. 100 years later still us.  vaccine get? also curious viral load theory. doctor went India getting Pfizer help got COVID passed away. course, also super old means immunity, general, gets weak tough say what's chicken egg. I'm inclined agree. Even YouTube allow anything like level bullshit get Honestly, think I'd mind Pandemic 2 plays similarly. Sounds like someone knew doing. Anti-scientism cult sure.  

They literally think saying makes - that's fucking magical incantation, that's spellcasting, every bit effective always been.

And using life science extended using devices science created. Yea thats good well, kinda needed sooner rather later...

Im pretty sure also already producing risk extent still quite blow. 17th got. What‚Äôs worse, 1 Disneyland millions people eating indoors tens thousands restaurants? fair, fundamental human right able reject something done better worse.  Nah. set restrictions obviously eradicate them. busy eradicating one, two mutate existence.

Maybe someday we're better vaccines. Societal lockdowns ain't gonna get done. 2 vaccines already oven, probably even bother trying. US literally give away money people get damn vaccine‚Ä¶ 14 million small amount. might need locations serve lot transient people want count return second injection. go higher. vaccine really reactogenic phase I. I've vaccinations I've chatted docs &amp; nurses waiting. plan stay masked least next spring, quite nervous fall/winter bring due variants. Delta variant, variant we've yet discovered.  
It pretty sobering.  unknown routes 2 weeks (\~ Jun. 16, 00:00 ) : 25.4 %

Nice! literally gotten downvoted saying continue wearing masks till least 70% total population state fully vaccinated + children access + people vulnerable family fully vaccinated.

I see continuing wear masks public transport forseeable future. Even help COVID it'll still help viruses. Worst case scenario, useless bit cloth mouth. big deal.   aware many old people killed giving flu lifetime? lot. Real covid gonna kill you, vaccine kills you, welp. Tough luck guess. Im vaccinated :) don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted lol. You‚Äôre completely right. It‚Äôs infuriating see widespread panic one ‚Äúnew variants‚Äù get mentioned. UK majority people going hospital young discharged quickly. lockdown advocates suggest lockdown every time new variant comes about, may well locked forever. learn live covid like flu. live South Africa country filled bunch fucking idiots idiots happen running it. 88% still means R well 1 I'm pretty much hermit, yet n95, surgical masks really made keeping safe. exact opposite they're meant do, keeping doctor spraying droplets wound. know efficacy, Delta variant definitely small town YET. Even then, kids rather safe. reason people freaking Delta young people surveys UK, enabled people 20(i think) even getting vaccinated. reason age group spiking hard this. vaccines STILL protect rather well.

Even then, yet again, I'm hermit. I'll keep odering groceries pick up, instead going in, avoiding public places keeping kids away people vaccinated, crowds. Like people see family.

Been contemplating buying dust/paint mask(Protects youself filter, exhale vent, protects one else around public.) that's think settled on. buy one earlier worried spreading everyone happened come across. But, fuck em. right, gonna pull trigger that, stare bit harder. Thank :). Gosh, seems optimistic tone compared rest world, conspicuously step. least explains I'm seeing lot bravado Americans thinking met Delta variant urging caution. mean almost zero rates similar vaccination percentage UK, numbers turned rapid corner. couple percent Delta, almost 100% case couple weeks, spreads like wildfire. twice infectious ""Covid Classic"" (50% Alpha/UK/Kent 50% base, roughly) reports far.

I urge American friends complacent, half million Americans already died young millions left long term problems, yet. thought hoped so, Delta bugger.    Well deterrent, guarantee. course go changes make life, like touching face time. We'll alright. mostly idea sit minute pondering crap world want get face it. get carry anyways .. thanks caring :) thing like articles always mentions Pfizer effectiveness. wish articles included Moderna well. lot people know one would nice know fairing variants. sure vaccines doing? Probably key difference CureVac uses uridine rather pseudo-uridine. 

Uridine one four letters used RNA. 

Naked RNA cells danger signal - usually signals RNA virus trying hijack cells function. Inside cells receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect different variations RNA. 

When TLRs triggered, leads signal cascade response shuts translation immune responses.

Katalin Karikio (Pfizer) Drew Weissman discovered back early 2000's substituting pseudo-uridine place uridine allowed human manipulated RNA sneak pass TLRs. 

Both pfizer moderna mRNA vaccines use pseudo-uridine. fair much better tools federal level mandate vaccination  Um. 11 year old pretty important family, NO. almost none.  nasty 10 day flu-like illness around 9th january attending CES (which huge amount Chinese attendees) feeling might corona. Especially since months later close persistent contact confirmed symptomatic covid person catch it. late antibody test, right? We? Bubonic plague also extremely deadly nowadays get antibiotics quickly. Washing hands machine breathing would little reduce death rate. Months ago subreddit full ppl downvoting saying obvious - isn‚Äôt yet. cannot let guard down. 

If don‚Äôt get people vaccinated lockdowns social distancing never going stop. people stupid understand that. absolutely hate break you: either people break lockdowns States even bother make new lockdowns.

For USA people go another year two this, everything opening back up. big corporate push. Slaves home font make money. Workers home working home taste freedom. People starting wake sbitty system is, capital class desperate put blanket back heads  THIS. type reason get vaccine. thanks everyone else refusing, put far riskier situation.

Hopefully make :) record, SK never covid 'zero' nation. getting variants UK? fortunate we're one vaccinated countries even still, f give us break please! idiots absolutely going learn. Even smart people followed safety protocols everything right first time going get lax restrictions lifted.

If hypothetical outbreak variant somehow doubled worst numbers saw US, there'd still strong resistance anything it. We're goddamn stupid. We've seen fully vaccinated people protected Delta severe case. see reason another lockdown 25% refuse get vaccine. Oh, shit.  Antibodies great metric. lower much faster actual resistance. That's fair criticism. email address keep reading.

Guess I'll die. nobody killed them.  Umm? Dallas county population 3 million people, even hit 40% full vaccination. milk make sick? jusy unappetizing.  Beep

Boop beep Yeah delta variant sounds scary. don‚Äôt know us handle since everyone already seems desperate go outside forget covid exist. It¬¥s less stopped atm, mutations still spread can¬¥t lock borders literally everyone international world. without taste/smell almost 5 month. fun giggles month lived super healthy. cry taste stuff Thanks sharing info. Many know that. reason countries like UK, US, Canada paying people couple hundred bucks get vaccine? Seems well fuckin worth it. get second shot! You're.. thinking way bud

It might cool diet maybe week, never anything good tasting ever again, cravings could never satisfied, social events involving revolving around food would likely lose luster

More importantly, taste know milk gone broccoli gone off. smell difference gas leak lethal gas leak No, making excuses ignore points. explained point invalid. Peace mind functional purpose, again, something immunocompromised need, attitude screams ""fuck people, problem"". Speaks volumes person, tbh. Anyway, I'm done entertaining conversation. argue good faith, worth engaging with. yeah people infected Delta UK young ones, ones still vaccinated single winner Contra Costa County Placer County? counties? oversight ""lottery""? lost taste smell years ago.

May ask question this? [a previous mind permanently losing sense taste. donuts ice cream suddenly taste cabbage kale, eating healthier would immediately become much miss sense smell, already great nose anyways, huge loss.

You raised fear recognize symptom, that's legitimate fear. let's pretend worry death flue apocalypse moment.

Is assessment right? easier eat healthier now? What's like permanently living without smell taste? I‚Äôm fucking tired shit Makes wonder species managed survive long has. Could less transmissible (or less dangerous, that's less likely) first broke out, mutated transmissible later, caused pandemic. perhaps explained mRNA formulations curevac pfizer/ moderna different.
Curevac used, understand it, non modified mRNA advantages stability ease production.
The modified mRNA biontech, moderna use modified mRNA induces specific immune response. tries circumvent general immune response get foreign genetic material introduced. Sounds like shitty parents shitty. Get jab. Im U.S oldest vaccinated. local hospital automatically books second shit get first one must inform certain point get, or? would guess trial concluded placebos get informed chance vaccinating something. MD here. Trust science. okay wear masks especially areas vaccination rates herd immunity. CDC every reputable scientist would say same. 



Hospitals special case significantly larger immunocompromised population compared general population. Vaccines amazing. Trust science. Honestly might even vaccinated, think effective. Idk people weird. Last time continue small talk anything close political. feel you; scared, too. And, yeah, shit nasty. trapped home sucks. However, I'm one flip-side cannot stay home, so.... Fuck china, maybe millions lives important ""academic goals"", Mr center universe I'm UK. Last 7 days rate growth cases started slow. Hospitalizations rising much slower rate previously deaths 1 2 digits. 
The average age someone contracting covid 20s (unvaxxed).

The UK Government announced maintain current restrictions additional couple weeks get 2nd doses even talk going back lockdown get talk therapy? countries vaccinations. live Netherlands, get vaccine 2 weeks. I'm 25, everyone older already vaccinated. Exactly. also suspect Moderna could easily halve quarter dose keep nearly equal good results, probably played safe trials. I'm saying go quarantining Delta becomes vaccine resistant able get around vaccines may say screw watch whole place burn ground everything falls apart economy due people dying large amounts followed medical system crashing due overwhelming amount sick people medical staff dropping fatigue, etc. eventually society gonna collapse regardless, matter accelerate collapse slow down. one would rather live cave solar panels, rain collection purifiers, small hydro garden away people point.

Edit: also thanks award. realize serious part. calling Indian variant may play tricky game people's brain, making feel safe India =/= live  none 'zero' nations vaccination manufacturing lack supply vaccinate faster Problem delta variant 25 mutations. 0.3x25=7.5. good thing mrna vaccines great vs new variants. problem enough production 2023 care. immortal. 80 normal age die. least he's still wearing mask.

I hope stay healthy.  took Moderna doses didnt much side effects except bit arm pain fatigue. anyone else mild experience? sentence redundant. thin herd anti-vax idiots! that? sort thing unprecedented? downvotes comment lol God damn wanted facts figures go claim ""And significant portion people died, 40."" 

Everyone talking circles. Yeah, no.  \#ModernaMafia feel man. nothing ruined mental health pandemic. thought life gonna pick should‚Äôve known better. never ending cycle don‚Äôt wanna part it. Yep got downvoted saying worried kid - young vaxed- going catch Covid mask mandates dropping. discussed top post sub. Pfizer works much better moderna reason delta variant. I'm going wearing mask public foreseeable future. enjoy risk catching things along new variant. U.K., 31 percent confirmed Delta variant patients needed emergency care received least one vaccine dose.

Oof. Depending time scale study done, sounds like vaccine effective all. Where? also strong flu Jan/Feb 2020, work mate contacts clients north Italy got sick. became sick infected wife son. wife infected several work colleagues also. suspected H1N1 maybe covid19 test months later show contact virus. strange thing none persons mentioned covid19. Tbh point know. prefer stay safe wearing mask, social distance I'm two weeks away second pfizer vaccine. could buy antifog glasses use cream soap  Yo everyone seriously trying avoid actual question?

**HOW TRANSLATE AMOUNT DEAD YOUNG PEOPLE TWO STRAINS?**

I'm asking contagious is. Okay, viral load matters what? gave smug response comes nowhere close answering question. UK India, basically Moderna (it‚Äôs approved UK supply isn‚Äôt there) there‚Äôs way knowing. conspiracy, enough vaccine generate data. double dose. Wonder single dose like

They basiclh tired make cheaper mRNA vaccine somehow work referring trends, individual specific mutations case case basis. Hence wrote exceptions, especially short term. 

In long run virus want cause weak immune system response extremely contagious. way virus able continue reproduce spread new hosts also reinfect people antibodies strong. 

I could original post gone detail, stated original post it‚Äôs layman‚Äôs explanation. mean...most likely forum could bunch ppl thinking bad 0 concrete proof..

Also even let's say true, rather take risks getting covid possibly dying b4 joke young ppl less likely die well guess what, still suffer effects covid heart, lungs, many organs basicly permanently damaged.
And also helping making covid die out, completely better.

I liver disease, loving husband 2yr old son love. ppl refusing vaccinate risking life family(ofc took vaccine better choice getting covid). This, bit getting sick winter blessing. Imma ride masks good minute. That‚Äôs based af... Respect. I‚Äôll throw wholesome you.  variant becomes dominant easier catch, gets caught less hosts die faster. 

Delta dangerous hosts, still transmit long time. words, really sucks.  Here‚Äôs one article discusses severity children. 

[Covid-19 Mumbai: second wave, kids still 9 deaths don‚Äôt see problem get jabs peoples arms already. Regardless whether covid-19 synthoms (who cares flu end?), vaccines prevent death least? What's percentage death delta variant among vaccinated? True that's mrna type vaccines. wonder people react eventually 2 doses enough everyone get booster 2022 from? Asking similar small town masks‚Ä¶ study NPR article summarizing it. made mistake, isn‚Äôt Pfizer testing it, Johns Hopkins Funny enough pattern happened spanish flu. year progress tons asholes refusing wear masks, people gave take anymore, killed shit ton people. positive side number people hospital Covid UK still extremely low variant spreading weeks now. Vaccine uptake high. offered everyone 21. delay ending lockdown allow extra 10 million people get vaccinated.
It hammering industries though decision reversed one week notice. Following, thought mutations random? someone give honest answer bad Delta variant is? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated Pfizer vaccine definitely feeling hopeful life state reopening college announcing in-person classes activities. seeing controversy Delta variant worried I‚Äôm currently experiencing anxiety attack it. someone share thoughts? Thank you! i‚Äôd right didn‚Äôt littles 12. hate state basically said, fuck kids, get back work. Suns played packed Stadium week. done bubble now. last season. creep store, get dog, go walk around park go dog park. Talk everyone friendly dog let everyone wants pet 'em.

Seriously...I got dog, incredibly outgoing (I'm much opposite). wing dog. went Disney World Valentines' Weekend 2020 pretty shitty health begin with. dodge fuck ton bullets. source? 80+ CFR 20%.

If reduced 5% vaccine, that's still pretty significant step ... Inside NBA (EJ) said test negative twice separated 24 hours cardio testing (presumably check myocarditis).

Sounds like could miss anywhere 0 2 games. Sam hell fuck reading I'm work, time link sources information readily available via quick Google search. Also, half measures (only people wear masks sometimes), put evolutionary pressure transmission give plenty hosts figure out. similar effect people using antibiotics time leading lot bacteria survive them. everyone would compliant, dumb thing would starved couple weeks. Honestly fuck china this. pandemic literally destroyed academic goals. me, would. J j one dose purely artifact testing (they confident, went one dose, whereas mrna hedged bets went 2). made different decision, would way round change vaccine all. absolutely nothing suggest one dose j j better lasts longer one dose mrna, anything opposite. Give delta shown need two doses vaccines, particular az closest j j, one dose j j makes vulnerable someone 2 others. mix match fully tested early indications look good. Full results due September uk, although cover specifically mixing j j antibiotics viruses? Cool Well vaccination already slowing coming 50% population. 30% wont vaccinate probably last 20% waiting new killer strain make motivated. Well delta might it. happen, going hospital winter might mean fighting influenza patients bed.

Palliative care become much better COVID-19 last year, IFR appears around 0.2% 0.7% roughly places category mild bad influenza year IFR. luckily, coronaviruses mutate much slowly influenza latest research showing natural immunity easily last year see CFR IFR drop increase care along sustained immunological resistance breakthrough infections.

All facts help drive R0 around 1, means remains endemic, rarely causing large growth infection. late. Delta everywhere funny people like ""why, afraid vitus? wear mask?"" good response ""why afraid wear piece cloth face?"" guys like project fear onto everyone else. clear easily frightened. scaremongering rhetoric get empty pockets gifter politician. Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll lockdowns 1 1/2 years getting vaccinated. people done  Ok creepy! That's anecdotes. already established covid kill healthy young people onset pandemic last March. 

I'm asking actual statistics compare original Covid Delta Covid young people. Nope... you‚Äôre confused. Antibody (neutralizing) levels studied found last 8 mo that‚Äôs long studies lasted. still B cell memory cell memory response consider. 

The science immune system didn‚Äôt change. example purely anecdotal. 

Also, several studies shown antibody titers covid aren‚Äôt necessarily best predictor immune protection. 

Essentially you‚Äôve gotten covid protection years. see people took comment wrong way someone fully vaccinated go India get this.

I India, yesterday neighbor told dad uncle (dad's brother) got infected month full-vaccination (AZ / Covishield). Uncle hospitalized died, dad mild symptoms fine now. friend's parents similarly infected too, within two weeks vaccination mild symptoms (though sense smell / taste back even month).

The neighbor's family first case I've heard infection month full vaccination. know person co-morbidities, except 70 years old.

There also talk Delta+ variant another wave hitting soon. really know going come this. Man would donate blood told Goddamn legit gives goosebumps read stuff like this. I‚Äôve low lows past 16 mos I‚Äôve also seen silver linings literally everywhere turn. listening episode Nature‚Äôs podcast tonight scientific collaboration via covid changed everything.

I hope continue well. Take care there. December got lightly sick nothing odd till end lost sense smell taste month. week sick hit like truck, cough lasted months. tested flues strep nothing came back positive. worst feeling ever felt , double flu almost kicked hurt. fast strong. 
The town live fairly low number cases covid. remember Nov/ Dec school week 2 many sick. One kids dads daughter's class died thought flu positive.
I can't say covid fully vaccinated always get flu shots. work clinic getting sick inevitably. Yeah, silver lining pandemic puts brightest spotlight biggest idiots, know avoid next time. mind asking, US? Eventually, Corona seems replace flu done far. age group hardest get approval for. People keep forgetting vaccine process REALLY supposed go. comes children, process supposed longer fragile flux systems already are. age group vulnerable comes possible risks vaccinations always data clinical trials moving next stage. I‚Äôd love available daughter, know one reasons they‚Äôre giving pushback. California variant? Manchester variant? Etc etc I‚Äôm sure shouldn‚Äôt hard vaccine stop transmission.""

This still false. sure trying contrast statement state say vaccine, still get infected

This true although considerably lower low enough disregarded lockdowns place majority population vaccinated. case vaccinated people would free pass whatever want week second shot. also reduce transmission.

It reduces transmission 25 times iirc although remember vaccine specifically metric for, around ish value tbf. people fully vaccinated. already know this. used word 'stop' instead reduce. get severely ill die, much less likely.

Yes know this. Variant pretty much destroyed Vietnam‚Äôs (my country) good streak Covid prevention, spreads easy fast. we‚Äôre sitting ducks waiting vaccines. boils blood seeing US population access vaccines people still refuse take Definitely appears hierarchy among vaccines, mRNA adenovirus vector protein subunit inactivated virus. 

The Sinovac (CoronaVac) Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) inactivated vaccines disappointing efficacy lot breakthrough cases developing world; bode well Chumakov (CoviVac), Bharat (Covaxin), QazVac (QazCovid-in). You‚Äôd think train Asteroids machine living room kid would chill give perspective‚Ä¶. pandemic poorest nations fully vaccinated. Yes. really bad countries would difficulties cold chain requirements mRNA options. huge issue countries like EU, UK US. Well great Germany's economy, that's important right now.

Hopefully speed trials next-gen CureVac Covid mRNA shot, hopefully one turns work better, used booster option needed, main vaccine countries ""easy storage / logistics / handling"" requirement.

Say hello annual COVID vaccines keep yearly variants bay. Pandemic 24 months entire world probably. much this. People around talking called indian variant look data, growth exponentaial linear (+2000 cases every seven days past 3 weeks) keep vaccinating good pace. personal belief 2/3 weeks time number cases start decrease naturally. Especially given school holidays coming. It‚Äôs still officially schedule.  voted abyss saying opinion. Dang. came ask country Africa? Generalizing continent two data points almost useless. decided worth pursuing new vaccine designed original variant given success vaccines.

* 25.4M Pfizer (first/second combined)
* 40.2M AstraZeneca (first/second combined)
* 0.46M Moderna (all first doses)

0.65% doses Moderna, overwhelmingly youngest patients vaccine used ‚Äî i.e., population least likely need hospital treatment, confounded fact many given Moderna first released would carers clinically vulnerable (i.e., higher risk exposure/illness).

Yeah exactly! Would people rather pay content? expect something absolutely nothing? wore mask protect others well myself. vaccinated feel safer. 

Others don‚Äôt know vaccinated put minds ease continue wear mask would wear it.

Until, 80~90% population vaccinated harm wearing mask.

Um....people wear masks states 70 80% vaccination now. Wtf even talking about?

And fact don‚Äôt blame China scary. Look root cause. never happen China responsible every single Covid death around world. much state government making effort poorer, black areas? Iirc, states even department motor vehicle office counties (where go government ID driver's licenses, need vote) , which, oddly, tend heavily black counties. problem also many countries barely getting started vaccinations. need ramp vaccine production ASAP, 1-shot solutions could prove viable get vaccine candidates approval, I.e Novavax, efficacy 90%, postponed later ‚Äò21, Russian one Sputnik V, 92%, dk credible studies apparently production standards problematic Putistan, concepts sounds promising could produce Europe and/or US.

Not mention full month vaccine take effect 2nd dose Agreed. AZ‚Äôs efficacy lower mRNA vaccines seems like it‚Äôs better nothing. Western world 

I mean...that's exactly right it. India also exporting vaccine production right now, explicitly positioned global manufacturing hub less developed economies pretty much biggest reason Covax delivering many vaccines right now. Sure, they've got local shortage lot deaths, that's exact reason western nations exporting much. 

China also provider vaccines, responsibility bear Africa any? Russia?

Mu entered chat. Yes wear mask invest bullet proof vest. They're fucking nuts.  Transplant patients immunosuppressants like rituximab, example, vaccine much all.

You would expect patients still easily contract covid. Look, 9am thursday, let know 10pm newscast.

TL;DR Yes. can't tell actually infected thinks weren't. stage 3? don‚Äôt think know others failed stage 3, testing actual efficacy vaccine. lot failed before, everyone I‚Äôve heard made stage 3 eventually reported strong results.

Dr. Gottlieb said would become dominant variant Fall, wait till see surge occurs. surges occur states like NJ there‚Äôs high number vaccinated people, really great deal trouble need new vaccine. 

Also curiously, IHME shows sharp increase cases NY around time, signifying Delta variant may then. seems like won‚Äôt end WORLD population, individual countries population reached herd immunity likely take years, happens all.

Heck thinking going back wearing mine. single mom one disabilities. 

..................what?? entirely certain works :p  realize COVID significantly safer kid.

However, long-term health effects it, *want* give kids COVID -- would stupid.

The vaccine available people every large group risk hierarchy, kids next. That's worth talking about.

Also, since *want* kids catch COVID (even severe them), means families young children need continue COVID basics (without community support) vaccinated. Families young children left behind ""reopening"", significant source frustration parents, worth talking public. TF talking about? effective treatments, they're cures. there's universal law says peaks must happen winter.

Bluntly, coronavirus around multiple years yet show seasonal pattern, infer know: know coronavirus spreads easier colder drier conditions less sunlight, easier indoors outdoors. learned last year vitamin levels patients correlate risk contracting symptomatic case. pieces generally describe seasonal cycle worsens winter. full year observed far supports this.

 saying summer increase ""seasonal"" poor inference. Calling ""seasonal"" counterfactual, say contrary established facts. understand question, vulnerable Covid19 second dose. variants make second dose bit less effective impact first higher, second dose increases protection, cannot decrease it. However 12 days short, waited bit get full effect.

Of course went wearing N95s french kissing random unvaccinated strangers second dose may actually higher risk mean vulnerable, conduct much riskier. know that. Thanks.

Still, upbeat 24 hours suck fest. Kept telling kids, worried shit, million times better rona. lol'd, award Mu entered chat. know someone immune issues got antibody test vaccine part study. antibodies :( thing end pandemic US forced vaccination. Biden needs grow pair issue order already. Meh, entire world even 1 covid shot another years. see problem all. R0 covid measured changes regions world time. fact saying impossible R0 change false.

Check R0 charts example: Nonetheless, Pfizer performed better real-world data.

You can't compare RCT CureVac better clinical trial, still think clear vaccines better. go hospital, scrub room bleach. Correct. time school starts back media small subsect overly-terrified shut-ins reddit telling everyone Sigma variant going death us all, despite variants Alpha Rho already hype cycle ""new variant discovered"" ""omg going kill us all"" ""oh wait ended big deal"" like every variant has. guy talking rubbish, UK PHE announced 2 doses Astrazeneca 92% effective hospitalisations deaths occurred. Except pipe dream proven workable effective.

The reason (in wealthy West) achieved (collectively politics) chose to. Covid bit dangerous (or dangers signalled bit clearly population), believe would going zero transmission, whatever took, would nonsense 'freedom'.

The mortality morbidity seen much due Covid due poor response - poor response encouraged defeatists, denialists, sympathisers. See done. typically patients risk catching things medical professionals. medical professionals decked PPE Pfizer Moderna still 88% effective Delta opinion article misinformation ok? Saving future apocalyptic film. hate media, willing draw box around media declare joke, even though one ways holding power accountable.

 think Redditors read read comment? data proving second part fact know quite regulatory agencies would love hear you. Definitely. 100% believe December 2019 even (November, October‚Ä¶), everybody know thinks late 2019 January 2020 actually it, would herd immunity last April. evidence effective strategy, comes risk catching interim. think anywhere near bad. Even hardest hit groups, really really old people, fatality rate ""only"" like 3%. mRNA vaccines 90%+ effective preventing infection. contagiousness infected also dramatically reduced (75-95% lower viral load), assumed period contagiousness also drops. End result nearly 100% reduction transmissions classic strain, bit lower escape strains (beta delta). vaccines weaker good data, certainly still offer substantial sterilizing immunity.

Vaccines, like wearing 2-5 layers masks, protect around you. It‚Äôs route would anyone else caught bat (or intermediate host human bat). cave research reasons doesn‚Äôt make different route transmission. also California since early April. hopefully Californias cases continue decline, things looking better. Wearing mask equivalent wearing headphones me. means don‚Äôt bother Sad see. bigger hopes vaccine. Good call stay hydrated!  people worth worrying about, immunosuppressants might make sense get antibody test. Take one give quantitative value (measurement versus others, yes/no value) looks S/spike antibodies (not N/nucleocapsid antibodies disease makes vaccine doesn't).

Perhaps even important, make sure friends vaccinated. get Moderna I've fully vaxxed j&amp;j 2 months?

Interesting. Another aspect think probably testing much UK. US, fully vaccinated people need get tested even exposed. not. ~60% B.1.351 SA trial (compared ~70% classic strain US trial), effectiveness symptomatic infection vs Delta probably closer B.1.351 number. None women‚Äôs clothing. US never lock again, imo. Even there's ton deaths. point shutting + screwing economy risk even Biden take. going kind every man situation things get bad winter. doubt things ever get bad definitely see deaths winter, even vaccinated. Nothing 100%. can. told people trials take ibu, part vaccine guidance, there's reason think would problem. 

But really make sure stay hydrated. Ibu also hide dehydration, good. That's sad. Can't believe many people locked almost 1.5 years. Glad live sane state. have...which makes variant thing even concerning...although, really open young people recently there's that. sars-cov-2 rapidly mutating introduced humans lot room easy growth, gotten infect hundreds millions billions people get lot random mutations. fundamentally different human coronaviruses influenza.

It commonly falsely claimed diseases spread contagious less deadly. Diseases mutate random - full stop. mutations spread contagious ones, COVID's low baseline severity selection increased severity. lineages we've seen contagious suspected deadly.

We could see kind mutation endemic viruses, they've much time optimize human coexistence odds lower. actually even know COVID severe diseases - kids get adults minor. I‚Äôm worried state (NJ) cases increase Fall. 2nd jabs nailed opened everyone way earlier. think smart choice young people likely socialize want enjoy summer partying. incredibly fascinating.

I'm equally excited alarmed possibilities. hope whoever gets patent stuff venture capitalist. Sorry, definitive no? [You literally posted 12 days ago yes sub gotten really really angry anyone suggests taking prevention now. I've literally gotten downvoted saying continue wearing masks till least 70% total population state fully vaccinated + children access + people vulnerable family fully vaccinated. Yes, fully vaxxed wearing mask literally harms one people seem getting militant again, odd. I'm even telling people wear mask, I'm saying I'm going wear one. People write angry messages believe science CDC I'm like, seriously...the CDC misled us? mention still learning virus go along. definitive, experts remain skeptical 
 
I need clarification statement. *What definitive?* 
 
Why expert skeptical ""latest largest study""? *was done correctly* make skeptical results?  dated thats mind. also horrendous remembered, still noticeable difference two mRNA's every category. Israel small. even 10 million people. EU hand, ordered together vaccines, population 450 million. possible vaccine producers deliver many doses once. 

The US export stop vaccines components needed make vaccines. kept everything country. EU didn't. Companies produced vaccines EU soil exported lot vaccines countries around world.

So different vaccination level US EU large part result US Americans selfish EU Europeans. Directly beach yes, people still go congregate indoors.

Definitely not. good enough contact tracing 90% cases could pre-symptomatic (not yet symptomatic time testing). exact numbers, vaccines give good protective immunity vaccines also protect society dropping cases. cases start rising time J&amp;J-vaccinated people look booster shots.

I sepsis even check later. recently found knew sepsis possible, correct tests.  Shit, think $50 cash would. Yes, antivaxxers opposed vaccinations general there's whole lot apathy/milder hesitancy, cash bonus getting dose convenient location (places people shop, gather, work) could easily push people edge. Wait, mean labs reporting test results? everyones card gets punched point. stop fear mongering. someone recently got married.... F CHURCH I'M OK ETERNAL DAMNATION IT.

Hopefully Garza ilk least put absolute bottom transplant lists.  Yes, looking effectiveness mere numbers.

However, remember still lives every decrease vaccine efficacy warrants lost lives. Let's put way. experience ones vaccine hard time reaching special needs group cannot tolerate offices needles, potential allergic reactions. vaccine free, proven statistically highly effective literally wipe virus, accessible. Yet people take it. 
For people, point, know else say. die, die.  thought whole idea prevent serious complications? need worry much infections. info CDC way. Yes literally hug someone covid fine.  Since outside spaced, think risk getting covid super super low. need quarantine. nothing worry Delta man. buy clickbait weird seem bit unhinged offended suggestion living healthy lifestyle.

Amazing progress bee made vaccines still uncharted waters. always felt would take least three years see Covid. anyone told beginning 600,000 Americans would die . . . Hopefully kicks everyone got shots drive time fully vaccinated? would suck one unlucky people catches Covid first second shot, get time off. Right get little tiny reimbursement flu shot, free charge.

Straight discounts would nice too.

Pfizer Moderna, J&amp;J (which recently trash 60 million doses) US would still terrible shape. lucky scientific 'miracle', people still get them, sad people propagandized. would label anti-vaxxer?

Saying ""the media joke"" ""being critical industry,"" dismissing wholly. sympathies anyone hospital couldn‚Äôt vaccinated legitimate medical reasons, HOWEVER, I‚Äôm firm supporter natural consequences, anyone chooses vaccinate ends sick responsible illness.

Yes cases falling India death rates rising affected population large compared many developed countries. 
In many cases lack facilities like ventilators, oxygen supply caused disruption. 
But ongoing vaccination program possibly causing dip cases. That, surely positive India. Let's hope best.
Here's something COVID-19 affected us India[Covid-19 maybe doctor dangerously bad administering vaccines.

Or someone dangerously good lying. YES! outside mask mandate since first month pandemic. wear mask grocery stores, shops, malls, etc.

Also need mask cafes restaurants Even though Universal healthcare here, Canada same. Charge come I.C.U. Covid. Theoretically supposed possible centres allowing People 65 still workplace, interacting ages. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre saying garbage. They‚Äôre talking one dose vaccine basis approval, ignore available data, it‚Äôs trash. Great info. Much better suggestion replies temp emails. That's true whatsoever, stop spewing kind bullshit. got virus hospital, like hospitalized reasons prior infected. Also article states majority infections mild. Get vaccine can. American access it? wonder start increasing premiums via surcharge vaccinated - although would allowed remnants Affordable Health Care Act?

Not Debbie Downer, support obesity smoking? Shit happens. we're old bodies feeble even vaccinated chances die. Nothing stop   Someone told Chris Paul this‚Ä¶ actually making point.

And want that, either. 1918, anyone? No? 1957? 1968?

Influenza kills. 40,000 US annually, recall.  Yeah I‚Äôve seen people argue literally r/coronavirus within past weeks.

I pointed something protects 90%+ that‚Äôs pretty damn good Oh sarcastic? people buy lottery tickets. 1/35,000,000 = sure thing. That's main one going around sub last days. 

Obviously data needed. Look 95% confidence ranges - pretty large due sample size. 

For Pfizer 1 dose, range 47% (wouldn't even approved FDA) 99% (the most-effective vaccine history world!) Certainly article light references :( ""I used drugs. still do, used to, too"" good news. Thank you. googling official sources (when made comment) said outside mask mandate resource may dated. find variant had? read illegal testing labs share information patients. high chance hanging unvaccinated idiots SIL's mother died flu. joke. Yes heard that.It's called Host city contract.

Look pay IOC like 1 billion yen ""IOC cancel Olympic"".(i.e Japan side,Tokyo side want cancel Olympic)

So happy whatever happens us. Huh, thought vaccine required, even anti-vaxxers. travel ban despite this. Got it. disease never completely going away point stop living fear, especially mild asymptomatic cases. don‚Äôt think problem people hesitancy first. It‚Äôs reason hesitancy things like (using mom example here) belief vaccines contain Chinese babies, antifreeze, microchips. 40% people getting vaccinated dead, think would lot newsworthy. Six people total died blot clot issues Yes I'm name calling fucking dumb, literally cited source totally ignored said fit worldview lol point rest workers vaccinated feel immunocompromised folks hard care deniers wearing mask protect nasty people? Doesn‚Äôt mask protect nasty people you? Poor Sideshow Bob. Insurance reply real exemption card, exempt coverage. understand human behavior huge factor this.

Some places saying vaccinated mask up, places saying still mask know people lie vaccinated make one little fake vaccine cards.

Severe cases kill you. everything possible. said fully vaccinated I‚Äôve seen medical professionals everyday citizens use term ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù immediately recieving second jab. understand takes weeks recieving jabs vaccine reach it‚Äôs full immunity level. Theres several articles posted different countries people basically contracted virus still ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù phase jab.

CureVac used different formulation utilizing unmodified form RNA highly immune reactive. anyone paying attention surprise. Maybe variants knocked efficacy couple points 95% result poor design. us get real flu anymore because...vaccinations!! People organ transplants cannot reduce suspend immuno suppressants without harming transplanted organ. stopped taking meds 3 weeks would likely cause acute rejection. 

I‚Äôm glad worked friend, it‚Äôs option transplant recipients. Currently emergency pandemic mode, everything state flux.

Currently, blaming people refuse measles vaccine rubella, causing outbreaks. People refuse vaccinate children, refuse medical care get sick something, often jailed simple preventable illness become bad causes serious damage, case case basis.

Perhaps laws need change encompass vaccines?

Currently laws state person disease, inform others infected, knowingly spread disease, jailed. Perhaps laws could basis anti-vax community. actually asking me? rhetorical question? us do. quote say refuses get. That's different people offered yet. Cool; Covid like symptoms, hide symptoms come work anyway ?  vaccine proactive measure effective. Age easier way determine death covid much weight. healthy lifestyle effective way prevent diseases, dumbass. Japan refuse pay IOC? IOC them? Canada, reported fully vaccinated man 80's caught Delta variant hospital died. already bad health hospitalized something else, immunity probably compromised, Delta variant nasty. We're asking names here, no, apply. release Covid anonymously, release facts. important information headline implies died Covid, may case all.  scientific process - smoking gum emails exactly?

I kept seeing stuff it, since January stopped focusing politics, focused on. mental health, personal development hobbies.  Turns really love reading Sci fi books. Get outa YANKEE NUTz like seat belt, sure people die wearing them, I'm still putting on. People vaccinated absolutely get hospitalized even die covid! free?

Of course not, government want foot bill fot booster need to.

Plus, idk best one. Though think get one I'm 18 obesity absolutely choice people make. people don‚Äôt get fat choosing eat salads choosing work regularly, get fat choosing stuff burgers face choosing watch Netflix 8 hours. glad live north lol. Two doses likely required laboratory-confirmed COVID - definitely true. 

On flip side, consistency resiliency natural infection really known. Studies seem indicate relatively persistent immunity, even mild/asymptomatic cases, variabilty data. Even infection created immunity two doses vaccine, time passed many since infection - especially got original March wave. Immune response typically weaken time - we're still stage pandemic need many people highest level immunity possible try quash it. 

tl;dr: get least one dose true up. Thought Onion first Verifying people's vaccination status way would go long way toward building trust. fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help.

So motorboat went on.

Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

That simply true. stats released state included 3.2% fully vaccinated hospitalizations, 10.7 partially vaccinated hospitalizations.

It seem vaccines still big impact mortality big bonus though. Many / flu deaths occur people develop complications already cleared virus, time show hospital flu tests would useless. often see ""flu pneumonia"" combined mortality statistics, terms like ""influenza-like illness"" refer strongly suspected flu can't confirmed.

To get official flu death tolls, CDC uses statistical techniques estimate number rather tallying individual decedents. official covid death tolls, however, tally individuals believed covid.

They're going restaurants, hanging others homes, taking precautions. One holiday - lot activity outdoors - going major factor. We'll see soon levels vaccination southern states enough prevent summer rise cases like last year (was already rising point), events July 4 much anything whatever happens. people sick, fucking forced take sick leave. bad impact covid deniers is, impact work culture makes sick people come worse. sorry üòû assure global aid vaccines / relief sight. normal BMI bloodwork get discount

So lifting/bodybuilding enthusiast get charged obese person...? see there. Every time hear people repeating stories like I'm 100% certain something read Facebook repeated fact. Facebook posts often end something along lines of, ""And hearing mainstream media!"" Yeah, obviously fucking fiction.

I really hate Facebook. better chance hospitalized win 5 dollars 1 dollar scratcher... yet still decide shot... can't math  fact lab leak theory dismissed months ago problem. theories dismissed way months ago:

It's always prior infection good vaccine, probably not. said, watching interesting information previous infection one thing interesting, much higher 0, bunches bunches people getting hospitalized dying second infection. byproduct gutted education system favors rich That's true. Covid would probably much worse temporary side affects may may get vaccine.  makes sense, vaccines work, matter getting vaccine people.  sentiment. vaccines god damned scientific miracle widely available everyone US even live Barrow, Alaska. know care get people interested jab. energy point. I‚Äôm starting wonder people even read articles posting them. people went claiming covid lie, flu, over-exaggerated, ""where's dead bodies"" fabricating stories people dying vaccines. 

It's mentally challenged gymnastics. flow chart proves u/tdaun's point, yours.

Regardless, AZ even approved EUA US, moot point. know exactly talking talking obesity. fact, even clarified comment: people ‚Äúwho stuff burgers face watch 8 hours Netflix‚Äù. absolutely ridiculous reply, don‚Äôt try justify fat using two guys insanely strict diets training regimens example obesity.

Sure Israel's population significantly younger US. Also since vaccination campaign recovered eligible means close 90% 16+ either vaccinated recovered. Heat map infections... mostly people either vaccinated recently able get it.   give higher rates smokers, seems like thing. choice made (to vaccinate, smoke) puts higher risk group. same. like masks many reasons i‚Äôll continue wear them. It‚Äôs fear mongers clicks. even villain, even henchman. Maybe flunkie hangers on, best. So, choosing this, cautious, cautious towards one issue, ignoring Assuming risk COVID reduced 90-95% vaccinations, I'm inclined think ""wait react necessary"" lesser two problems. 
 
It reduced without restrictions Rt still 1,0. already mentioned, without restrictions vaccination rate would 90% avoid runaway assuming Delta dominance. Delta already dominates far virus evolved toward becoming infectious getting less deadly. would evolve become less deadly large share population would die evolving become infectious would require become less deadly. evolving become infectious actually seems make deadly, far. vaccinated Sinovac got infected Delta variant. care vaccinated? risk vaccinated person kids nearly zero risk factor. understand friends still wearing masks. 

Do really need pay Pfizer another trillion dollars protect group people need it?  Dummies I'd like see math showing greater 50% chance getting covid vaccinated person state reported less 100 cases week. mental gymnastics getting fun.  Something definitely needs saying - behavior could causing deaths! autocorrect stroke? Perfect time take life insurance policy them.  Laissez les bons temps roulez going see another big wave developing countries vaccines produced sufficient amounts. see states positive 14 day average increase county level data counties huge upticks correlating low vaccination rates. Washington post recently published article phenomenon, Google find subreddit too. People going get covid test headache, sore throat, runny nose. Clever bug evolving around detection defenses.. Even vaccine 99.99% effective preventing death, that's 1 10000 people get die. might need boosters, also *one* death. vaccines dozens dozens deaths daily, might mean anything substantial all. virus beginning year. good getting vaccine?

[No, didn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs you‚Äôre saying . I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre contributing harmful narrative (maybe deliberately) vague language. transfer people deal Delta variant cases. Problem solve itself. Never attribute stroke explainable autocorrect failure.  also hate people risk peoples lives drinking driving! want vaccine bad :( They're 1%ers now. pretty safe assumption. However, details left interpretation many don‚Äôt trust media. subreddit turning surprisedpikachu.jpg posts unvaccinated people getting covid vaccinated don't. 

Not sure constitutes progress necessarily people expect happen.. guess make track sufficiently slow, hard meet it. could gotten away it, would slapped got offended asking cover cough, beating old boomer lady husband willingly spreading covid get overshadowed 45-year-old buff dude thrashing around small aircraft. Damned do, damned don't. see headline now, ""45-year-old male Roanoke assaults pensioner mask mandate"". Shit literally went head flight.

People real life: said least 14 days another article Variant Interest Variant Concern Variant Nuke Orbit Fair enough, stupid people deserve die /s

I hope grow less hateful, truly. good day. Tiktok great source information sadly. I'm physician looked whole load covid patients. pretty clear hospitalisation reinfection rare (there that's happened fully vaccinated patients too). 

The reason doctors recommend vaccine patients post covid that's defensive advice people falsely assume covid without PCR lab serology test. 

WHO claimed June 2020, evidence post infection immunity clear reinfection pretty rare. That's likely want ""infection parties"" people got deliberately infected. updated information say robust evidence immunity least 8 months. one saying infection safer vaccines, already gotten immunity natural infection, really clear data meaningful real world benefit vaccine. know best way combat Delta variant wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say raising hell since it‚Äôs 10% cases states anyways vaccine choose get ?then everyone protected shut down. Time make illegal many countries daily discussion thread. It‚Äôs stickied every day.

The rule titles strict good reason. learned lesson year ago posted something added exclamation mark. learned later subreddits rule. would get portable HEPA air purifier N95  say appreciate going trouble could help research Covid-19 variants? states seeing huge upticks? 

Most states I‚Äôve looked falling sharply, including big states like california, new york, Illinois, florida Texas.

Since last Wednesday, Thursday Friday Memorial Day data dump surprised Sunday U.S reaches 11-10k cases sub 10k next week! Monoclonal antibodies tend narrowly tailored, easiest variant escape (natural infection vaccines produce wider range antibodies, targeting slightly different parts virus, variant changing one part still vulnerable places) - even so, Regeneron's held surprisingly well new variants far: bodies produce lots *different* antibodies exposed Spike (whether comes alone part whole virus). mutation potentially defeat one - all. There's question whether variant could ever enough changes Spike's shape appear ""totally different"" immune systems, yet still right shape function (remember, Spike works latching ACE2 receptor cells: changing, different shape Spike fit).

Monoclonal antibodies better nothing patients without antibodies, course, narrow easy escape compared variety produce response either infection vaccination: think encouraging even monoclonal antibody therapies held long variants far: they're least flexible, first ""fail"" (ie need updating/replacing address new variants). Vaccines convalescent antibodies hold significantly better respect. understand talking about. tracking epidemic, percentage change care most.

Still n95 though.

Most standard masks stop transmission keeping you(if infected) spreading droplets.

Not trying dick, false sense security lead infection well. Also fully vaccinated masked best protection. Wonder many condoms go through‚Ä¶ best virus develops herd immunity *us.* might be. terrifies me. 15 months, called back work next week crowd thousands can't wear mask. Glad feeling better bueno. think responding guy said ""DELTA PLUS ULTRA SSJ BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON COVID

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" depends also variants, yes, good observation Thank actuall ""from field"" info.
Stay strong Brother. get rid influenza b Yamagata without even targeting it. virus caused around 10% flu cases year. COVID measures detected months. Can't eat inside McDonald San Diego really not, someone used info another study broke math it. 0.04 chance even hospitalized(if vaccinated). Yes, there's going deaths, there's always going deaths, even normal covid. That's number game, probabilities you.

You less chance hospitalized Delta(if vaccination), dying normal covid unvaccinated.

Now, deadly(Which seems so), anti-vaxxers treat. There's whole states like 60 percent population vaccine. There's also Delta Plus, resistant anti-body cocktail giving people hospital. Delta transmissible, thanks spike change, Delta plus even transmissible.

But, vaccinated, may get it, going rare people even hospitalized. Absolutely ridiculous. much here. Pfizer az first Moderna also used here. (and poster) mean ventilator right? would happen 150M ppl unvacced? literally got rid flu strains without even trying. Eliminating SARS-cov-2 far impossible. Correct, diseases detected LARGE proportion guests might affect cruise schedule. 2 mild otherwise asymptomatic cases.


Source: I've worked cruise ship. Vaccination alone without restrictions would feasibly reduce pool hosts virus mutate.

In opinion, ""there might might problem future""-risk management, which, considering cost extremely broad range ""this might problem two years""-issues world sustainable strategy. know high mutation rate 90% vaccinated population. Maybe variants develop reliably infect vaccinated people, vaccinated people infect people, dangerous them. Maybe another variant show escapes vaccines, need booster.

We know. extent, we'll wait react. know sure another year restrictions, soon students bachelor's degree never met one peers.   damage done already think would like claiming 1 year flu damages run course.

I mean, flu actually good example I'm saying. accepted we're going get rid it, manage risk. COVID-19 future, IMO plausible point time start treating like flu now. see situation going improve much.

Germany, actual covid infection is, purposes immunization, treated like first shot two-shot vaccine- covid, get single shot vaccine 6 months later, strengthen lengthen protection need remove flair since highly doubt received third shot. rough time actually think protected Delta. foreseeable future... yeah, is. said India that's bad word now. support mandatory vaccinations. vaxxed im still wearing mask. outdoor shooting range weekend still wore even though fogs glasses bit, others too. variants serious. see places people masking, possible worst places, cramped stores, grocers uncovered produce etc. Take shit seriously still people  hand, would like know travel thanks. saw states wondered Idaho list well.

Disneyland California stopped requiring masks yesterday (for vaccinated people enforcing verification), I've seen many Californians freaking we're ""definitely gonna another surge we're gonna go back lockdown"". know gonna take getting used lot people. I've seeing Tiktoks people film people (with faces showing course) wearing masks Disney putting captions like ""ewww"" like, they're vaccinated following guidelines they're clearly allowed so? ever get rid flu? think so. Thank you! comfortable catching covid next year, though? matter concerns vaccine covid risk factors, covid far higher danger. worrying (about vaccine covid, assume) go away after. sounds like unhealthy sales pitch, mental health matters. point pick lesser risk move on. 

Long term would assume vaccines remain available pharmacies last year, protected. work covid patients see 3 6 months, ""immunity"" goes away. antibody get sick, nearly effective vaccine regardless long though. Hard compare cause can't compare India countries 60%?

I mean let's hope we're wrong Americans uniquely disease-proof, I'm pretty sure we've right before, complacency turning hundred cases well half million untimely deaths, plenty scope :( think reference prime-boost regimen Pfizer vaccine.  According experts late stop becoming dominant strain U.S. although may take weeks. Thats actually true, literally work home enjoy solitude. interact people, consider risk exposure better believe take precautions. also would love trade places someone feel like tough decision. chronic immune suppressing health problems go get vaccinated move life. implying selfish, thats bullshit Eh said variants would run rampant US cases kept falling. point wonder UK actually *increase* restrictions order control spread Delta. insanely better without it... hate masks  need reach point stop caring asymptomatic mild cases.  told virus nothing liking home low figure like UK, ready remove final restrictions, Delta blown suddenly massively. similar percentage vaccinated USA. really suggest getting complacent around shitty disease. appreciate that. terrified virus. wear mask go out, slightly germophobe pandemic. People gross. wash hands sanitize constantly. think people need understand waiting vaccine different ""antivax"". every person waiting get vaccinated screaming wearing mask believe science care others. Great timing school district make masks optional kids even 12 aren‚Äôt eligible vaccine /s can't find paper results anywhere (despite Merck saying press release they'd publish results) guess good mine. Masks pretty much done Wisconsin, awesome! I'm convinced. Breakthrough figures Delta variant seem reported 10-20% ish range, 2% fatal looking actual reports sub.  Moderna also uses mRNA UMM WTF. Source link anyone. Don‚Äôt understand downvoted.  1st shot vaccinated (2 weeks after, moderna) exposed someone covid. entirely sure get not, lost sense smell. fully lost smell, still taste things, there's nothing smell strongly, smelled car exhaust. maddening. room example, smelled car exhaust time. tried putting burning incense candles, work. put paint mask, still smelled car exhaust. stopped around 3 weeks after, coincidentally week got 2nd shot. symptoms sure covid not. Maybe could build sort wall around North keep disease out? border perhaps? reciprocal, keeping mind Grump  happens time. people turn Fox News get scared imaginary immigrants. think afraid. Even chance getting infected, quite harmless vaccinated. Saw post Washington Post via Facebook. Someone's uncle two doses vaccine still caught covid died. Another lady whose mother also vaccinated twice went hospital surgery caught covid died. think surgery probably weakened still possibility Delta 2.   Isn‚Äôt CureVac one intended partly cheaper easier-to-store mRNA developing world? seems absolutely gutting so. Yea, everyone wants believe pandemic suggestion otherwise get downvoted. Even isn‚Äôt working Novavax mRNA vaccine rather protein subunit vaccine. Reader mode moved goalposts. mom's sense smell return since February. Mine returned around 1 week half. Taste seems normal us (but believe less sensitive sugar now, maybe adapted eating habits eat food without taste Covid-19). Spot on.  reasons gave definitely systemic conspiracy theories. people taking vaccine get heart inflammation, blood clots, plus side-effects. real.

Not quite right length vaccine protection type protection.

By calculation everyone eventually get infected one variants live long enough. question bad short long term effects end being. 

If people vaccinated consequences X, Y, Z associated probabilities. 

If aren‚Äôt vaccinated consequences A, B, C associated probabilities.

Binary choice unremovable uncertainties. looks like inescapable gamble seeing situation correctly. people dislike gambling health would rather leave hands trusted doctor, etc. 

That long winded way saying nothing medicine works ever ever absolutely safe. I‚Äôd happy vaccines 1 10,000 kill/cripple rate lifetime. 

Given data far actual odds look like 1 200,000 so.

I downvote post dislike others did. Unhappy face emphasis üôÅ.   Commerce must go even half customers longer exist guess. 3rd November - thanks that... wish masked worked like this. could living lives now.  thankfully home depots etc n95s back stock US pretty easy head get few. U.K., 31 percent confirmed Delta variant patients needed emergency care received least one vaccine dose.

those ones start dying like flies soon. probably delta+ well. definitely still get vaccine. Supposedly, severe COVID case, antibodies someone has. COVID got vaccine. lot people say people COVID worse side effects vaccine people didn‚Äôt, vaccine, less 24 hours side effects. second vaccine barely caused anything, arm soreness headache hours next day. One got covaxin India made vaccine, doctors got Astrazeneca. also think viral load played part hospital see uptick cases week got infected. used wear full PPE kits work even able protect stupid virus. Tbh they're healthiest individuals half family seems susceptible covid BIL got sick contracted Covid time last year (so mutations hit). 

It unexpected show symptoms degree doses though. people family contract virus first dose Astrazeneca barely felt it. One person dozen hospitalised. definitely tough say what's work here, immunity luck what. far possible we're still staying home. Doctors enough year. need work. article 8 months old. repost? nurses like say, ""mask casket"". We're morbid bunch. article year old, April 2020. [Cloth masks vary protective still give decent amount protection. Couple vaccinated hopefully low community case counts, it‚Äôs potentially effective easy precaution take little cost. Thoughts non-consesus mRNA dsDNA encoded spike protein segment 9 pharma players, mass distributing public slowly, testing infection prior vaccination. could exact thing? Driving escape mutants. Honestly, eat healthy since couple years ageusia (loss taste) caught Covid-19 exasperating even people eat healthy treat ""rewards"" time time, allows many people commit new diet long run... eating chocolate ice cream without sensing anything cold unrewarding depressing. Since already ate healthy lost something gain anything every food tasted like cardboard.
I could see someone bad eating habits could potentially benefit though, also dangerous since know eating something rotten and, obviously, deregulates brain reward system. immunogenicity vaccine humans SARS-CoV-2 variants concern remains original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 well B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1., B.1.351 variants concern.

Delta mentioned Okay, sure, let's pretend there's strong evidence come lab Sorry, forgot month*s*. Curevacs vaccine stored 3 months fridge. reason countries like UK, US, Canada paying people hundred bucks get vaccine? Seems well fuckin worth it. Hi - haven‚Äôt getting lot information this, anyone knows, would great! Hashimoto‚Äôs disease. treat Levothyroxine, contracting COVID twice, antibodies around thyroid spiking, causing flare-ups.

I‚Äôve vaccinated since April (Yay!), doctor advised go forward haven‚Äôt (sad). statement isn‚Äôt research long vaccine stay system autoimmune disease. anyone else heard this? paper trail justifying it?

I‚Äôve bubble last year still caught twice. I‚Äôd like know free eventually beer something public. straight true. also chemotherapies cause people lose sense taste (I one several months, everything wasn‚Äôt super spicy tasted like cardboard.) 

It real problem, pleasure involved, eating becomes chore, people don‚Äôt feel like bothering. Red Cross test blood antibodies. Except there's proof would motivation behind it? AFAIK vaccines even really give immunity, lower risk severe symptoms consequence lower risk hospitalisation death. Even getting fully vaccinated still catch pass virus, ways even easier pass virus vaccinated lot less likely know (because vaccine combats severity symptoms, rather stopping getting infected).

Obviously coming person medical background. lot careful cross referencing DIY research (so someone please correct I'm misunderstanding vaccine protects us). I've first dose far still keep distance, wear mask work home because, honestly, takes almost 0 effort (maybe single unit ofeffort wearing mask summer heat.. still.. almost effort 0-100 effort scale totally thing (a thing made up)).

TL;DR: afaik vaccine meant prevent severe symptoms rather making immune catching passing virus. Someone correct I'm wrong please I'd like know that's case ü§ì  Meh. already get annual flu shot I‚Äôll happily get annual COVID shot time. perfect world they‚Äôd single needle. Viruses typically, large time frame. still beginning one. Yes, although often reduced efficacy. It‚Äôs worth makes significant difference. point US, many adults vaccinated going swayed money. trying incentives encourages people seems quickly fade. love argument less content article started post. makes wonder person replied even read article Reddit transcript article.

Also, remember correctly, numbers double dose Pfizer. single dose Pfizer double single dose AstraZeneca offers much less protection. vaccines wasted since people chosen take show up.

The absolute total administered vaccines could higher less stingy age selection.

Plus, kids infect people too, especially since least responsible age group. cut 21 dumb.   hate this. hate keeps getting worse. can‚Äôt even get fully vaccinated till September, plans see gf summer would‚Äôve hopefully came July. delta variant U.K. it‚Äôs unlikely won‚Äôt need isolate USA fully vaccinated.
It sucks, it‚Äôs heart breaking. Yeah knew enough know dangerous really came much anything else, really. say UK made mistake vaccination age. 


Looking deaths hospitalisations important metric, prioritising age way forward, even today UK far better USA metrics. 


I'd rather spread low deaths hospitalisations way around.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Even vaccine patents waived, guaranteed able spin capacity. Vaccine production hard scale many vaccines AZ showing global shortages key manufacturing components. hard less well-off nations procure vaccines, clear they'd able procure earlier stage materials either...

And case, Russia, China India also locally developed vaccines. waived patents? want cast aspersions, seems might dislike West... article WaPo detailing exact case. Unfortunately, person died second infection. Quite opposite, fact, sustainable strategy also adhering Precautionary Principle. 

Continuing last year cause lot harm. guaranteed. ""people die COVID"" harm, lots lots lots adverse effects people's lives. includes health issues, ""not enough sports"" psychological problems.

So, choosing this, cautious, cautious *towards one issue*, ignoring others.

Assuming risk COVID reduced 90-95% vaccinations, I'm inclined think ""wait react necessary"" lesser two problems. myth though? doubt companies sitting like 'lets make vaccine prevent infection, prevents severe disease.' . vaccines prevent severe disease, mean designed prevent infection - too, extent severe disease..

Fox News confused anything, knew exactly bread buttered know showing mildly related statistics gets fan base foaming mouth. coronavirus training hyberbolic chamber come super Saiyan. 2,300,786 cases. 37,265 deaths. 3rd country WORST Covid statistics. Texas California taking top. Also Florida highest population states. Get facts correct. NY. look state health department database find I‚Äôve vaccinated doses Pfizer, lot numbers. last several flu shots, Hepatitis B, TDaP also listed.

If Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama databases, I‚Äôm *pretty sure* everyone does. example bad testing capacity eroded United States. highly doubt limited South Carolina think safest assume case states tell us more.

I've suspecting rapid drop cases short period time California lot state testing tracking varients. Length time exposure key factor here, infected hospital.

I'm fully vaxxed, I'm going get phone booth known infected person hang hours. Wearing masks N95 necessarily stop virus decrease viral load exposed to. potentially impact making less ill get sick. Add vaccine golden. personally wear masks places understand people still do. Cloth masks don‚Äôt protect things, though. you‚Äôre wearing N95 24/7 cool, also ugh lol. thought main mechanism protection keeping droplets in, need everyone wear them.

The interesting statistic would percentage hospitalizations fully vaccinated people? already know single doses nearly effective.

And society supposed do? current vaccines work well variant, could make new vaccine time available distribute, likely newer variants. means modern science can't compete virus, we're fucked. R value measures potential virus infect someone. Like measles R value 12 18. never changes even though measles rarely infects many people vaccinated. Oh well, Moderna shots, back hermit mode me, get booster that's specific one. Bloody boomers way proving that. Dont underestimate mutation.

Idiots man really wanna hermits. R value many people someone infected subsequently infect.

I REALLY liked getting sick year I'm planning masking come fall nothing covid.  countries much common.

So again, vulnerable population specific. critical care general. People still automobile accidents, heart attacks, strokes, getting shot, etc... becoming way treat people. 

Around time precautions put place, doctors stopped working hospitals performing optional surgeries. Again, reasons. worried vulnerable patients would get sick... ensure taking hospital beds unnecessarily.

South America thought neocon nightmare 1990s over, came counter-revolution Macri, Bolsonaro, coup d'etat Bolivia, etc, COVID. yeah, personal terms miss 1990s. Ha!

It's much easier sequence samples dozen. guys much better controlling outbreaks did. 

In US, still thousands per day. Illinois November/December day 15,000 positives, positivity rate high enough clearly missing tons cases. Fox News uses seasonal flu stats make argument. think conflation confusion (or both)? Yep, already here. came say sexy piece vaccinated ass Dave G kids significant risk. nearly 600,000 deaths US 300 people age 18 died. never understand everyone focused vaccinating lowest risk group coronavirus's seasonal uptick happened *in winter*

That's simplification. cyclical, there's universal law says peaks must happen ignore dismiss hand attempted counterfactual statements.

What ""dismiss counterfactual statements"" even mean? said long vaccinated, fine. really feel parents young kids, around awful situation hopefully vaccinated sooner think. 100% agree vaccine passports would great solution Republicans determined never happening, we‚Äôre back zero solution getting people vaccinated, don‚Äôt understand worked helps anyone all. I‚Äôm vaccinated. entire family friend group vaccinated. do? There‚Äôs nothing bad using free email address freely. It‚Äôs business model apparently works. Don‚Äôt think big tech anywhere near sinking. Journalism hand propped duct tape paper clips everyone 100 justifications can‚Äôt bothered Seasonal? know else break you: UK *northern* hemisphere, means June summer. coronavirus's seasonal uptick happened *in winter*. uptick lot things, definitely *seasonal*.

It mean need shut world, *does* provide real data would folly ignore dismiss hand attempted counterfactual statements. sure downvoted. people would like see mask mandates continue indefinitely.

The factor left community transmission levels. state local area live extremely low levels community transmission. That's another reason take mask without worry. Even I'm 100% protected, chances encounter infected person extremely low. People use word ‚Äúflu‚Äù refer kind bad cold. Oh thanks. understand frustration another lost summer. wish could go faster benefit everyone. that's exponential growth works people bad understanding it. take many doublings really matter.  far off...  I'm New Zealand. wondering hard could done 24 hours matter treatment

It matters lot controlling outbreak though. sequencing comes back identical known source (eg someone current hotel isolation) much problem, able contained using contact tracing techniques. known source means government need lock city means there's unknown carriers wild.

Edit: actually asked /r/AskScience answer less totally understand frustrations. feels like right shit getting better me, mentally reinserting normal routine life, happens. Like can‚Äôt keep putting life hold, something give. care mental physical health? Well I‚Äôm filling vaccinated mental health trash going much, fuck that‚Äôs I‚Äôm doing. can‚Äôt imagine miserable another 6 months more. difference minimal hardly worth discussing. states quarantine lockdown. Everyone high numbers statement makes sense. I'd love source knowledge comes from. We'll see whose bigger idiot then. got flu winter covid hit never understood became talking point. immobile week, nearly fainting got bed. barely strength enough lift glass water worst it. coughs felt like convulsions ... like lungs dry heaving. Weirdest thing. shivering sweating clothes time. absolutely miserable. remember reading article last year claimed majority hospital staff actually got infected (in break room etc) patients. could weren‚Äôt able enough testing recently. ‚ÄúSo saying fully vaccinated people still get hospital? told vaccines safe!‚Äù -probably anti vaxxer lived full life Verification vaccination go maskless public thing would change situation. that's happening.

The likely outcome kids vaccinated September/October.

But, going long stressful summer/fall keeping distance irresponsible adults then. sped timeline, used 10-12 weeks. NY dropped covid restrictions Tuesday hitting 70%, seeing much change Queens (only saw one unmasked person commute bus). expectation long buses trains require masks people going generally on. federal level restrictions sort thing go people may stop. Manhattan long while. Oh, it‚Äôs really bad sure. But, much vaccinated people. Eventually antivaxers going ruin us acting mutation incubation chambers, I‚Äôm going enjoy normalcy then.  I'm literally getting old shit... Thank you! true. Nearly every person know much sniffles Spring 2020 insisted must covid. Ah, come on, man. saying Anti vaxxer nuts Canada all? tired Canada much better BS. nuts everywhere, maybe US little bit relatively given political radicalization here. people vaccinated, less spread virus, less likely 80-year-old die.

Delta isn‚Äôt problem, vaccine hesitancy problem.  18+ tomorrow OP, people really get vaccinated even they've COVID. Longer lasting immune response better protection variants. Family acquaintance vaccine hesitant, finally scheduled appointment, came Covid appointment. Similar guy story, 50, diabetic, overweight. He‚Äôs hospital now, need oxygen least couple months. Death relevant metric. take precautions unable work take care kids MONTHS. 

And cry ‚Äúbut economy!‚Äù, well guy‚Äôs small business going he‚Äôs recovering unable work months? Yeah remember Pfizer celebrating profitable booster shot Awesome. Good thing cant get vaccine Im 36. son a‚Ä¶. worst period. It‚Äôs double edged sword. one hand, they‚Äôre essential serious problems, otoh, much likely contract infection there. many stories folks admitted non life threatening issues die preventable infection weird turn events, positive outcome something started tragic Tanzania, denialism main policy Magufuli passed away.

Although likely take while, hope get lot people vaccinated thanks covax. really. amount vaccinated person get small even somehow breathe right person's face getting sick asymptomatic cases (unless immunocompromised maybe) viral load small. basically vaccinating people breath point...kinda. Vaccines produce much better immune response allow safe much longer virus previously vaccine  need another election throw covid scent bit people know UK Pfizer one. Delta variant that's catching out. represent majority infections US August. get complacent.  Yup. right bout that. That‚Äôs problem people thinking vaccinated everything fine.  case, worked. everyone able get need diet, can, that's awesome commendable. make replacement LDP.(I never voted them,Padme!)

We build alternative strong enough.That problem emergency. Hopefully next year stop paying people vaccinated. next year still vaccine get sick fault (unless immunocompromised). Tragic? Poor pregnant couples? tragedy people die get seriously sick. rest tragic. Inconvenient yes tragic. masks what's keeping people home -- lack trust people around you.

Throwing away band-aid heal cut.

People stay home, masks themselves, want exposed nasty pathogen. Yeah, younger are, less nasty -- mean want get (and pass on), even kid.

My observation within community anyone whose vaccination status know (because told me) continuing wear masks. Judging looks alone (because that's have, due lack verification), looks like less-responsible people unmasking. opposite building trust irresponsible people people need keep kids away COVID-world.

If want get people lockdowns, need **build trust**. Ending mask mandate reverting honor system **did inspire trust**, lots people (myself included) continue stay home longer.

If want get back normal, need build trust, throw away masks. reason trust average unmasked stranger.

There's reason kids need exposed mess, adults get shit together Nope. Growth already slowing. Vaccines jobs. shot vax hope works vs Delta Young people, though? teen, $50 big deal me. And‚Äôs that‚Äôs key demographic prevent spread COVID right now. demand anything.

If people instantly died infected Covid, virus even left China.

But no. Delta variant infects even fully vaccinated people, meaning *we know* someone infected right now, like before.

No, test covid ""proof"" infected. simply means result likely true point time took test at. could infected test touching door handle.

We always 2-3 weeks behind reality present. current, imperfect, data based true 2-3 weeks ago. I‚Äôm you. I‚Äôve followed guidance letter since Day 1, extremely cautious. we‚Äôre lucky best vaccines ever created science, 90+% protection provide good it‚Äôs going get while, maybe several years.

As someone noted already, many health insurance companies require declaration whether use tobacco products, presumably higher premiums do.

No one asks obesity, arguably obesity choice people make (or rather choice instantly made).

Nope.

To use extreme example, vaccine 75% chance protect getting illness, one vaccine, that's 1 4 chance contracting illness, STILL pretty fucking shitty something bad.

If vaccine 75% chance protect you, EVERYONE gets it, (depending R, etc) effectively 0% chance getting it, we're protecting other.

r/boneappletea

He melodramatic point exactly. ""It features enable escape immune system perhaps evasive Beta variant (B.1.351) first identified South Africa, worst now, says Topol.""

Pretty sure that's supported research. I've seen several studies showing Beta less impacted vaccine Delta, none stating otherwise. Awesome thanks clarifying Yup. There's book called Great Influenza John Barry describes things people went through. favorite (paraphrasing while):

""...skin sallow pale could tell black men white...'.

It scary. smoking, yes. obesity, bit complicated -- many causes obesity, medical (such certain medications cause lot weight gain short amount time). Except little Pfizer left. 

I called central number try book appointment today told taking appointments first dose Pfizer try next week. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt always drugs. do, prefer caffeine.‚Äù Historical data problem, projections are. Spread skyrocketing larger exponential could had. traded slightly better linear reduction hospitalisations that's bad trade. Either cases level quickly enough deaths start rising exponentially. gotten doses one? super frustrating see even people say support science blindly believe whatever sounds sciencey... 

It's spirit science all! don‚Äôt think looking data. think basis reimbursement conspiracy hospitals would code anything Covid death get funding. Get shot head test positive, Covid death.

It actually pretty offensive health care workers implication unethical think ended 28 people total developed blood clots, 3 died. least they're getting vaccinated, even find nationalistic fervor stupid.  Sadly, daughter hospital last week, one nurses came told us OK remove masks around since masks work. kept on. sad thing fear can‚Äôt get vaccine part group science says (pre-Delta spreading) 70% need fully vaccinated. Everything normal then.

But even cautious states stopping 70% adults getting first doses, measurable herd immunity. That's usually somewhere around 50-60 total populations fully immunized, ending important new strains.  actually mean present actual opinion... description propagates... 

It's absolutely correct interpretation past year üòÇ one said one better. point made ""infection immunity + vaccine"" better feeling safe already got covid. something *has discussed* since many believe infected means they'll safe long, long time, seem case. 

You also sarcastically mentioned ""classic argument"" versus people talking vaccine immunity. definitely thing, there's huge global concern that. So, maybe read lines things predisposed find there. taste smell starting come back, still really wonky. example, used hate mushrooms tomatoes, wife added breakfast tasted fine me. love chocolate, chocolate tastes like charcoal spit out.

Everyone high blood pressure deserves die covid ‚Äúvaccines create immunity without causing illness resulting complications. Using concept herd immunity, vaccines successfully controlled contagious diseases smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella many others.

Herd immunity makes possible protect population disease, including can't vaccinated, newborns compromised immune systems.‚Äù

The way immunity get infected, vaccine may help doesn‚Äôt make anyone immune COVID. See everyone getting infected regardless vax status (which isn‚Äôt appropriately counted you‚Äôre vaxxed you‚Äôre told test)

The article outright said ‚Äúvaccines create immunity without causing illness resulting complications.‚Äù blatant lie. 

We also know people compromised immune systems aren‚Äôt tolerating vaccine well, extent it‚Äôs working. Yeah, fully functioning set too, iirc.

I evidence since documented cases US point, wonder actually COVID one knew since way tell back then. today's Reddit articles there's one interviews friends relatives several recent deaths, unvaxxed. large percentage black.

Not one interview said friend relative unable get vaccinated. said personal decision trusting thinking necessary. We're dealing inappropriate personal decisions here, government policy. believe it! place gorgeous, looks pretty secluded too. Vaccines give immunity well, enough people get vaccinated, add herd immunity. Yeah Covid freeloaders Mississippi variant‚Ä¶ mean Lambda false.

Every day passes recent days per capita 9-10 times americans die covid UK. 


Therefore disagree assertion that:  think U.K. made mistake going straight age

Because whilst seeing resurgence cases (bear mind UK tests 10 times USA) dying whereas USA still dying worse outcome.

The age based vaccination programme designed stop deaths done effectively. Odds won‚Äôt, especially mRNA vaccines, coded see whole spike protein, virus mutates point evading vaccine totally, virus won‚Äôt even able infect human cells begin close UK vaccinating teens? US vaccination program basically stalled. Everyone eligible basically walk participating pharmacy get shot (whichever brand) without appointment. point i'd open giving extra doses UK &amp; Canada. Give vaccines ppl actually want deserve them. That's use matched controls. 0.1% vaccinated group get vs 2% unvaccinated controls, well efficacy 95% Everyone‚Äôs part. you?

Would like know more? That‚Äôs figured too, like we‚Äôve months loose restrictions open restaurants/bars, suddenly Disneyland sudden surge?

Extremely rare? least 25% coworkers took half-day due vaccine side effects. One 4 days. I'm talking blood clots here, stuff normally lasts day two. Sure say vaccines contribute herd immunity asinine. miss Mitch Hedberg :(

That‚Äôs all. can‚Äôt make stop. agree everything else said. less billion years old yesterday? really sure answer that, I'm extrovert definitely need social interaction, also work full time home software engineer. spend lot time online voice chat friends (a friends hang discord like, day every day, work, work, etc.) beyond mostly play games friends watch TV roommate, play guitar, want go something well fully vaccinated.

Ironically I'm usually things alone go person lol (this partially due moving new area last year able meet anybody due pandemic working remote). sidenote, anyone suggestions making friends new place work new place go school there? agree.Lots people choose ""go process elimination"" long time (being Japanese,you know),as result,we built replacement,in 50 years so.

I agree go different way,to honest little bit scary old lady,though let LDP stay power scary.We get lid LDP,actively. atoms not. think may continue ""observational study"". infuriated anti vax healthcare workers. inexcusable even one patient death caused unvaccinated worker could occur. Next time states wants secede, help pack Correlation versus causation. large percentage people USA obese large percent vitamin diffident. percentage people die virus barely different distribution USA, lot them, people understand statistics jumped possible cause. virus causes control inflammation response, body handles varies person person largely factor genetics age. sound like ""man flu"" me. describing genuinely sick can't effectively care (providing easy hydration, simple foods, NSAIDS/humidifier/warm baths help manage symptoms body heal faster.)

It would unreasonable call someone, even means 911, condition. tip iceberg. whole family deep it. insanity stuff send proper scary. I'd appreciate that, too. I'm trying spark discussion topic question extend knowledge this. far evidence/articles I've dug up, notion vaccine protects natural antibodies unfounded, least needs research.  You‚Äôll need convince everyone else also continue wearing mask want avoid colds. observation within community anyone whose vaccination status know (because told me) continuing wear masks.

Sounds like hang lot people important everyone knows they're vaccinated wearing mask.

That's experience all. vaccinated first day available eligibility group even know masks anymore. Probably clean clothes pile. social circle like (all ideological spectrum), social circle pretty sane really making stance Covid important facet personality.

Your whole trust mask argument, shrug. I'm sure that's relevant anything. kids significant danger Covid. driving around car dangerous. made statement families ""left behind"" untrue. vaccine available you, children material danger. thing ""leaving behind"" participation society scientifically unfounded anxiety. That's deal, society's. irrational anxiety cross bear, everyone else's. make problems peoples' problems - that's selfish. prevent infection too, great extent (at least original variant). sure hope so.

I hope tests positive, patients hospital labor delivery, knee injections, elbow injections. isn‚Äôt much disagreement among ID specialists virologists this. data doesn‚Äôt show delta variant much immune escape. vitro actual trials. Super villains people think they're superheroes they're stupid self-involved realize they're bad guy.  flu flu, type people spouting freedom rights make sick. regard people around them? profitable get richer selling it.  
So... somehow prove needed?  Well that‚Äôs said, doesn‚Äôt seem remaining so. Implying uncertainty future potential change. don‚Äôt bark me. Youre explicitly arguing comment want virus spread, call hoax, especially know mutates quite fast. get away media ridicule contempt non-existent justice department. Hell, even State Governors willing commit treason repeatedly opened economy despite loss lives; economy important without workers shortage now. Yep. respected publications go die. Please slander Nurgle cultists like that. Okay, here‚Äôs perspective. Fuck complaining giving birth going chemo pandemic, people actually died? way worse.

Point being, Woe-is-me Olympics annoying fuck. People allowed feel bad situation without constantly reminded others worse. always someone suffered more. Don‚Äôt shitty friend reminds people unless it‚Äôs absolutely warranted (which given comments, also lack certain EQ‚Äîthe irony).  Won‚Äôt happen. Giant meta studies ivermectin proven it‚Äôs viable therapy. soon Europe USA accepts viable therapy, vaccines lose approval. Emergency approvals possible viable treatment. data available, mean DATA shows two doses nearly equally effective variant others. Articles like trash, plain simple. 616,150 dead / 28,616,495 recovered = 2.15%. statistics standpoint, need crazy order magnitude error rate = .2%. population sets big, rarely ever case. work largest medical center world. actually worked medical field, noticed people randomly dying even seemed recovering. yes, learned much strict put someone breathing support, also ton treatment options now, people still randomly died anyways. vaccines slowing rate infection thing slowing number infected see, impact percentage people need support die anyways. insufferable

It's true. percentage hospitalized two weeks two doses? I‚Äôll wait. realised measure breathing need Max VO2 test see happened. sleep apnea machine records events per hour, treatment level etc.

Since second shot events per hour dropped tenth months prior. feeling confident things getting better. 

Did quick 10k bike ride today actually managed go fast enough sweated! First time sweating forever. awesome! someone tsdr us? shocking backwards Japanese government despite country's reputation. least herd immunity protect them. probably get it, they'll gloat never needed vaccine, fact everyone around getting vaccinated saved horrors covid. going emergency care you‚Äôve fully vaccinated already, good thing?‚Ä¶ understand bad is? feel like don‚Äôt know means trying downplay it. employer set vaccination drives time informed employees would longer provide 2 weeks get sick covid.

I kind liked approach.  Right? I'm OKC could think ""Oklahoma: 0 days without national embarrassment"" meme lol. keep busy without seeing people person much? Wouldn‚Äôt get depressed, way keep depression away happen? f confusing reporting. says ""fully vaccinated"" goes suggest 10 cases one round vaccine?

Regardless, appear mild cases.  still feel bad stupid people thought microchipped. 

I still cringe see stupid person step rake smash face. Nope. Incorrect. Please consult actual scientific sources crap you‚Äôre seeing media.  mean, hospitalized mild.  They'll probably try tell insurance asking vaccinated HIPPA(sic) violation. ""Why would zoom convenience fact (insert CONVENIENT PLACE EVER)?

They part Disney acquisition, though, they're part Disney Publishing now. ‚ÄúThis variant seems like it‚Äôs really bad‚Äù

Data support this. Please back claim.  Might lead people think got covid never getting vaccine probably also partly removed mask requirements schools current stage lockdown helped spread slightly quickly younger age groups. 

That said, main group infected 18-24 likely group socialising more, understandable. would bet three weeks UK start see R number drop pretty substantially group gets point majority two weeks past first dose. particularly effective compared two doses, still fairly significant effect, especially given younger people respond better vaccines. Rip immune system known since beginning still test positive COVID vaccination. main thing is, there's almost 100% chance hospitalized die COVID vaccination. articles won‚Äôt convince true believers, could help people hesitant haven‚Äôt made priority. sure many people still fall category. test antibodies, cheap test. cases reported. one reports ‚Äú100,000 fully vaccinated 80 year olds make another year alive‚Äù. 

Selection bias finest. OH GOD!!! mean might like getting flu shot!?!? NOOOOOOO don‚Äôt understand point here. think NZ small fairly isolated island nation. yes, good leadership certainly plays role. success stories like Vietnam Taiwan, lot footfall China, still able control virus. Bhutan, nearly tourists coming India, still able control virus. nations give hope :) I'm sorry loss friend. heartbreaking. fruits flowering plants, much else, metaphor exists reason. infection vaccination produces significantly better immunity, Even getting fully vaccinated still wearing 2 masks outside . people still getting covid vaccination scares me. Plus masks stop inhaling dust . Largely NHS centralised control/reporting. Countries like America India anything like NHS, really shows comes detection capability.

Everyone variant, especially good finding them. reason restrictions ease strain hospitals. hospitals overwhelmed urgent issue way months ago  Chuang stressed thus far, deaths directly attributed COVID-19 vaccine Taiwan take long time die covid, highly infectious, possible become infected spread virus show symptoms, there's real pressure virus become less deadly. Yeah, anyone wear mask keeps getting sick might longer life death choice?

They always think they're clever excuses wearing one that, thing previous infections (discount percentage still unprotected despite previous infection).  could high 20% Technically, always true. Yeah bad idea lie age official paperwork Exactly. People die every year flu, even they've vaccination.

It's sad truth, vaccine provide really 100% protection.  say ""we have"" even though mainstream media owned like 7 companies. You‚Äôre lame Ausyrlaia given like 3 million doses say three deaths


Still lots cases cvst. 1 older people now. people refer talk Mandela effect? condolences. üíô [RadioLab episode though? pictures stories coolers full bodies, deaths constantly happening, still nothing hoax people.

It might convince few, amount good amount, far gone..... it'll take something like happening loved one, maybe they'll concede... assuming think ""misdiagnosis"" something. Remember, people claiming fake death beds... kind sad fight attitude like that? New York City‚Äôs vaccination rate much lower New York State‚Äôs rate. say that, comment removed (again). plenty vaccine hesitancy go around US, matter color state locality.  totally understand initially warned pregnant people get vaxxed. even announced cousins hospital nurse. course refuses even reconsider much riskier get baby herself. she‚Äôs also called jury duty selected. Oh Alabama 36% us first jab. Sounds like least two things common shitty, wanting kids get special ed entitled to? hope Taiwan using latest treatment.

Which means blood test correct medication

That count risk lot more.

Blot clots still leave people life long battles 14,019 symptomatic cases 166 hospitalizations? missing here? figure really low (just around 1 percent)?  Wow, I‚Äôm sorry hear. I'm going defend since can't sure cause exactly, say UK vaccinated elderly population first know (now) VIPIT eventsare frequent population. extraordinarily rare events coming through, extremely difficult make link (keep mindthat CVSTs, though rare quoted approx. 4 million, still occur general population) imagine, hard determine causative event. reported events would documented (so say found zero clotting events isn‚Äôt accurate, would reports would available see), population vaccinated first, could well events similar we'd normally expect. lot countries first reporting events occuring younger population (which we're seeing restriction giving AZ younger people) whereas UK vaccinated group later (excluding front line/healthcare workers). Furthermore, literally hundreds ofthousands reports made vaccines, unless actively looking link unless risk several times greater thanthe normal expected rate, difficult identify. Fortunately nowwe 1) aware link 2) made general population aware events go question ""who knows many serious issues AZ shot‚Äù, say it‚Äôs going lot accurate/reliable previously since reports released weekly basis know now, we‚Äôre lot vigilant ofthese events constantly looking them. Also, countries reporting similar numbers UK well terms risk second doses.

E: Keep mind above, they've made clear they've defined count, events ""in patient died shortly vaccination"". going difficult mistake events pretty confident numbers given above. problem people likely vaccinated unlikely following rules wearing masks. spread virus among could say simply consequences behavior, circulate virus creates new strains could get around vaccines. risk adults legitimate medical reasons vaccinate (i.e. previous severe allergic reactions) unvaccinated children.  Masks mandatory hospitals honestly.  Walk hospital? Take mask.  Staff? Wearing masks.

So, let's back see capable answering direct question. provide evidence, outside anecdotal stories, Delta deadly healthy people 40? infectious. Deadly. Maybe right (I actually hope are), remembering times USA thought affect country ignoring lessons countries. sub always completely irresponsible prevention calling authority literally care problem entirety last year. Literally officials claiming whole thing fake, even mention anything ""purely p*l1t1cal"" post immediately zapped.

You CANNOT dissociate bad leadership bad virus control.


The mods sub indirectly contributed horrific irresponsibility. problem hard-core antivaxxers think conspiracy propaganda (deaths due covid fake made up) coupled belief people dying vaccine hidden covered up. can't reason someone view information (regardless reliability) fit beliefs fake information true. describing happen.

The problem hospitals overrun ‚Äúred‚Äù areas opposed restrictions, none.

In liberal cities, hospitals fine, restrictions.

2.	‚Å†‚Å†Considering know COVID, makes sense around months death.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†They used home made ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù antibody test. tricky best times, provide evidence validation test besides another article wrote also pending publication peer reviewed... chance false positive huge. MINIMUM done negative control serum 2018 sure. not.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†The proportion IgG IgM wrong. would expect total amount positives would balanced IgG IgM IgG (it stays around longer). case. Something like 85% positives IgM.

5.	‚Å†‚Å†They positive control 111 antibodies check neutralisation (if antibody something real live Covid). 5% (!!!!!!) ‚Äúpositive‚Äù tests came back positive. joke.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†The ‚Äújournal‚Äù published impact factor 0.87.... means article published two years ago will, average, cited less one time! It‚Äôs basically moms reading shit.

So, sum: bad science, bad tests, wild assumptions, bad controls, bad journal. shit around.  news, sun rises east, water described ‚Äúwet.‚Äù yup. Yes, winter spike completely dwarfed summer spike. summer spike also stuck parts US tended stay indoors summer. winter spike everywhere.

It's odd arguing description covid's seasonal pattern winter ""oversimplification"" problem calling aberrant spike delta variant UK ""seasonal"" misread said relation population size. apologize part. However New York worst death rates sardin level housing metro area vs rest state. Also Florida 15,000 rounded less New York death rate department much margin really go compare entire country. Also Michigan even less cases deaths New York Florida. 

Michigan also big restrictions place quarantine still effect today. 

New York started lifting restrictions due high vaccinations lowered cases showing up. 

Florida hardly restrictions place beginning yet higher amount cases Michigan almost par New York. 

Florida estimated 21.5 million population per 2019, obviously number correct anymore number find right base number run with. 

New York estimated 19.5 million popular per 2019.

Michigan estimated 10 million population per 2019. 

Florida 2.3 million cases 37,265 deaths.

New York 2.1 million cases 52,955 deaths

Michigan 996,275 cases 20,808 deaths. 

Florida least amount restrictions far worst amount cases people sick consider long term effects covid body, that's lot people die sooner preventable disease. New York worst death toll hospitals became overwhelmed almost once. 

So all, I'd say infection wise Florida WORST least restrictive quarantine methods New York worse due hit short time span. argument still stand states restrictive quarantine actually fared better didn't. 

If wanna go even further. countries restrictive already recovered never happened, South Korea New Zealand. Granted oddball ones like Sweden despite heavy restrictions still ended worst outbreak. norm. Apples oranges pretty similar though course Tulsa 92%? AstraZeneca effective original strain begin with. effective Delta original?  It‚Äôs also good overall health!

I saw guy day gym take mask completely cause saw everyone else wearing masks. He's fully vaccinated scared take finally realized make sense wear mask fully vaxxed took off.

Further, breakthrough numbers inherently misleading. tell us much many protected vaccine many gotten even unvaccinated. 

Remember, people gotten COVID entire course pandemic, even spread lot higher. way using data, would improperly attribute vaccines.  
The true rate direct protection vaccines basically found trials studies compare unvaccinated control groups. that's still really, really good. mislead people. It'd interesting match cell phone tracking data vaccine registry get idea dispersion unvaccinated people.

Well, thousands hospitalized COVID patients hundreds die everyday made wrong choice. 

The vaccine works.
It's free.
It's available 12yo.

Who live regret losing someone chose unvaccinated?

Because point, choice whether vaccinated. decision unvaccinated us indefensible.   close UK vaccinating teens?

It little yet, think. opened people age 30 last week think. take least month, perhaps two 18-30's get vaccinated.

I believe vaccines approved teens UK, would matter time. deaths yet increased though (holding around 10/day), mixture younger patients partially vaccinated may helping front.

Will interesting see things trend another weeks first/second doses continue increase. deaths remain low hospitalizations severe (i.e. fewer long term covid issues), would consider success.

Keep UK! could completely change everyday life injected money society don't.

Are serious? 3 billion divided amongst 330 million Americans $10 per person. Even gave working class money, working class American would get $30. certainly change life. reading thread. Everyone replied correct comments. questions quite reasonable come good observations. unfortunate much nuance here. original commenter disappointed reported efficacy means community spread longer stopped vaccination alone. Things ever bad March 2020, used real shot elimination. I'll give formula using determine percentage population needs vaccinated reach fabled herd immunity. Let percentage population need vaccinated vaccine efficacy E. Let R0 average number individuals infected person would infect one else population immunity. Then

 = (1-1/R0)/E

The original virus R0=2.5 (depending ask) use Pfizer vaccine E=95%=.95, S=(1-1/2.5)/0.95=.63 63%. case, elimination entirely plausible. delta variant, R0=6 (according original comment, I've heard 5.4 6.5) Pfizer 79%=.79=E variant. S=(1-1/6)/.79=105%! Given can't vaccinate 100% population, herd immunity entirely impossible. yes, covid stay. end world. disappointed. 

Do keep mind there's could considered calculations, numbers right ballpark. Helps really highlight undercounting past 7 days entirety Somalia reported grand total 1 death according John Hopkins. think I'd disagree. 30% unvaccinated pretty high point close vaccination rates provinces. lottery getting vaccinated partially happening Alberta's premier pushing remove restrictions time Calgary Stampede, move many Albertans disagree with.

Why would illegal share that? I‚Äôm genuinely asking; never heard illegal. Love I‚Äôm downvoted insulted don‚Äôt head sand want save lives. pandemic isn‚Äôt matter badly want be. Enjoy delta variant! Hope worth it! let's check:

us covid deaths per million: 1,821
vietnam covid deaths per million .63

so, pretty well far.   Right. critical point get headline. seems headline 10 people, fully vaccinated, hospitalized due Covid. case, all. 

The article says 10 already hospital think time infected time cases mild. last part could change, course.  Wow, they‚Äôre basically number cases US 5 times less population. That‚Äôs really sad see. Hopefully younger people get vaccinated soon enough. Right husbands siblings praying 1 year old cancer since born. won‚Äôt get freaking vaccine protect kids like her. haven‚Äôt seen year won‚Äôt vaccinated. Lazy self absorbed. AZ vs Pfizer 50/50 UK pretty much.  would great everyone vaccine. millions unvaccinated people there, infection rates rising. know telling must either get vaccine wear mask pointless. always problem people throw caution wind substantial proportion population gets vaccinated. think Delta variant that's driving current wave.

Hospitalization deaths increase 2 3 week delay every increase infections before. Sounds like natural selection studies prove ""old style"" vaccine protect delta variant? 
Also, know people rich countries acted like this. got mRNA shot mean superior.     noticeable joy city. 99% people still wearing masks stores.  many left one dose AZ. That‚Äôs mostly older crowd, they‚Äôre increasingly almost double jabbed. really need stop trolling Reddit, GET JOB get moms basement, told last night 35 years old old living moms basement wants out. :D Well, **vax**sectomy version coming soon? Lower efficacy, poor manufacturing track record, plus blood clot risk. Again, anyone call confirm.  hope keep good records. Someone might want multiple chickens conversation.

Yeah, opportunity 66% chance ‚Äúearly access‚Äù little peace mind big factor choice go in. got aches exhaustion next day injections, felt confident I‚Äôd gotten real thing definitely breathed little easier around crowds, felt little better hanging around older folks well. Delta variant 60 percent transmissible Alpha variant (U.K.) turn 50 percent transmissible ancestral Wuhan strain. ...a study review revealed doses, Pfizer vaccine showed 88 percent effectiveness symptomatic disease caused Delta variant compared 93 percent Alpha variant. Two doses AstraZeneca vaccine 66 percent effective Alpha 60 percent Delta. single dose either two vaccines, vaccine effectiveness 51 percent Alpha variant compared 33 percent Delta. effectiveness falls 50 percent efficacy threshold FDA set designing safe COVID-19 vaccines; vaccine prevent least half vaccinated people getting COVID-19 know people spend time indoors poor ventilation low humidity virus spreads rapidly. facilities didn‚Äôt get failing report like China tho Highly unlikely. 

Breakthroughs happen? Yeah, vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective completely blocking virus. But, one ever claimed are. Get vaccinated move life. He‚Äôs line, he‚Äôs right lot staff, especially RN's, still vaccinated 2 June - lost taste smell

5 June - 100-101 fever spikes, stuffiness, leg soreness lasted 1-2 days. 

9 June - Dry cough bit feeling lethargic. symptoms going away. 

Almost symptoms gone 13 June. Today slight cough wake sense taste smell dulled. went 3 mile walk 22 minute per mile pace. fast, think I'm hump. Yes, extremely unlucky, breakthrough infections rare, vaccinated people breakthrough infections much less likely infectious. 

Don't throw away masks yet.  live Well stinks - hope things better now. think alarmist it. 12 13 year old slight fever tired day. Everyone know felt anything back day later. think exaggerating effect. people know drama queens. theory, driver, lot us get agression roads. think pandemic caused extra stress people roads usual.  Great know. One biggest drivers get vaccinated ability visit elderly high risk family, good friend stage 4 cancer. really without knowing protected. I'm glad folks like stepped up.  give week plot Clintons China kill redcaps. Unfortunately UK, lots people 1 dose AstraZeneca Delta variant seem strong enough go that.

Although 2 doses either AZ/Pfizer/Moderna seem stopping virus fine.

Begs question strategy delay 2nd dose much... We'll see. forgetting people already disease getting vaccine. Seroprevalance around 50 percent near end March 2021, 15 percent people vaccinated.  five six times ""official testing numbers."" Yes, people gotten vaccine, many not. we're much closer herd immunity official vaccination rate suggests. Vaccines *do* protect *and also* prevent spread. body able neutralize virus replicate, logically you‚Äôre going contagious lot less time, thereby slowing spread. 

Imagine drunk driver highway - he‚Äôs danger either crashes, stops, stopped police. Highway cops perfectly straight, he‚Äôs danger lot longer driver navigate speed traps, tire spikes, etc. It‚Äôs truly amazing haven‚Äôt able get shit control. Two factors make different:
1) Covid-19 prevalent conditions like measles, making total cost Covid-19 hospitalization insurers higher cost measles hospitalization. may put onto radar
2) scale pre-covid anti vaccine movement much smaller covid era Wow, nobody could predicted this! Ugh want son return public person school year thought going okay. I'm fucking pandemic'd out. July 4th, unlike St Patrick, etc massive gathering event, families, fireworks, etc. huge year, truly first holiday states open again. Delta virus lot infectious, there's little doubt there'll cases places vaccination low bed new mutations. condition caused burn pit explosion Iraq. 45 us reduced lung function rest lives. secondary effects bad lung issues ended COPD, high BP etc. Prior deployment marathoner. got back could barely 2 miles without dying. brutal. also never knew blood pressure tied lung function. us pit exploded actually normal blood pressure. literally within week us issues bodies regulating blood pressure correctly. chest cut open biopsy done lungs. amount solvents chemicals breathed pretty high. still scar tissue it. Shit awful. Considering condition though think I'm decent shape. I'm honestly surprised covid kill me. definitely believe vaccine worked. I‚Äôm guessing money healthcare workers working insane hours this, lines front hospitals till midnight. bet they‚Äôd rather work giving vaccines deal Covid long term. something tryna noask.

did stroke? i? Absolutely. I've covid wish anyone. Ironically, herd immunity caused high vaccination rate area two things: 1) keep fairly safe COVID 2) solidify belief don‚Äôt need vaccine. Massive disinformation campaign thanks nefarious groups/countries like China, Russia, Trumps refusal take shot live tv convince stupid followers. Also weird fear think it‚Äôs ‚Äúrushed‚Äù since vaccines take years approve. likely right. seems like someone's choices come decision making priorities though. example, would fair someone may able use lungs years, gave lot community, priority someone 20s needs decided something like huff paint bleach.

I'd go far considering paint huffers prioritized anti-vaxxers. least trying infect kids adults can't get vaccine make sick kill otherwise acting incubator COVID variants. Self amplifying RNA uses regular uridine. purposefully goes dsRNA intermediate. BNTX/PFE trialed saRNA covid stopped p1/2. don‚Äôt think now, they? Technically vaccinations always preferred insurance companies don‚Äôt think anti-vaxxers pay now, they? (I might wrong!) Mind blown That‚Äôs 0.02% Wrong.

Here Brazil Sinovac vaccine aproved january since mortality rate among elderly, mostly vaccinated vaccine, declined significantly.

And study conducted city Brazil, vaccinated 75% population vaccine, 80% drop symptomatic cases 95% reduction deaths. Along that, phase 3 studies Brazil saw efficacy aprox. 65% (i dont remember exact number) symptomatic cases 100% severe cases deaths. numbers also confirmed studies conducted countries.

Decisions like rejecting vaccine efficacy cause many preventable deaths  controlling hospital infections would made noticeable difference. make comparisons automobile travel, cases I‚Äôd think air travel would apt comparison vacation travel. I‚Äôd love see numbers. hypothetical vaccinated people demonstrating effectiveness vaccine delta variant.

I believe ran numbers unvaccinated people regards delta variant around 190k deaths. Add pushing another 200k deaths. around another 5-6 flu seasons. Delta affiliate ATL. flight small Embraer one stewardess. give stewardess shit. really anything people eating clutching peanuts whole flight.

See part problem. trying completely shut conversation without bother hear anyone says. doubt would discount. likely added premium unvaccinated.  changing argument rambling now.

My issue giving bogus number. Vaccines work really really well, lie them. greatness stands accurate information. Yes, WANT go busy resort, WANT go full stadia many sports, WANT shit, but... right now, thanks, go ahead, I'll phone later see ice wet, water it. ""stupid science bitches even make smarter""  huh? ok buddy?  mRNA adenovirus vector protein subunit inactivated virus.

CureVac mRNA yet 47% efficacy.

Novavax protein-subunit efficacy. wish data much protection available vaccinated earlier on. know posts studies done stated vaccines work least six months but......everything changes often around hard know solid info sometimes. Yeah that‚Äôs actually positive. Vaccinated means less chance get hospitalized, absorb viruses petri dish country make cocktail shaker body. think that's hospitalisation, around 60% effective symptomatic disease. n95 really protecting much. Sure, some, much.

This false, masks offer decent protection although certain material e.g. cotton significant drop off. U.S. standard N95 confer magical properties plenty alternatives. stack surgical mask cloth, even 3 mask it, protects pretty well though.

Or know there's variant around twice transmissible original, may serve hesitate getting rid major vector *at time*.

ROTW learning aggressively Delta variant spreads right now, caution may help USA following pattern requiring even dramatic measures get control. Even people care friends, family neighbors, etc, economy, exercising caution costs nothing compared another lockdown.  2/3rds second shots. Everyone 12+ walk get whatever vaccine want basically stage.

It'll incredibly fortunate Poland even hit 60% adults (18m), let alone even close 50% total population (19m)

If first shots stopped it'd around 16m, I'm sure else done convince million get vaccinated stage.

If I'd open stockpile vaccine tourists Europe, simply likely used otherwise. Contra Costa County! lived almost 20 years. Carry on. ‚ÄúRespectfully‚Äù mean vaccines told 95% effective Pfizer recall... means 5% chance end sick.
But like everything life, huge unfair lottery point. find assessments accurate boring one's. siren emoji's ""deadly triple super mutant"" takes, ""variants nothing worried about, open up"" takes.

It's mundane, ""we quite know yet, need cautious due increased transmission"" etc. 

Bottom line is, say, get vaccine soon possible take normal precautions. older age groups higher risk also less technical savvy, love logic.

I consider important slightest, quite opposite fact, I'd also argue pretty average levels intelligence. fact I'm even engaging online debate would suggest possibly average levels. hey-ho. many downvotes? accurate. Florida reporting stats again? #1 New Cases #2 New Deaths yesterday Worldometers now. others commented, it‚Äôs due lack Moderna usage areas affected Delta variant. said, Moderna efficacy **probably** similar Pfizer vaccines similar.

Of course wait guidance relative health authority/peer reviewed studies, would expect similar numbers Moderna see Pfizer. Can't wait next even deadly variant they're cooking well  Fear paywalls...   makes think bullshit clickbait. No, info wrong. vaccines released determined safe effective, determined whether vaccinated person could spread virus. know makes much less likely, too. spread virus, produce virus, less sick are, less produce. Mostly astra? easy modify mRNA encode another protein, significantly different protein may still pass complete safety trials it, since new protein may well resemble thing give autoimmune reaction (some theories AZ blood clots point possibility, encode different spike).

So, count new vaccines pushed like software releases. Nothing confirmed site. make gibberish @example.com lets in.

 @example.com part old spec demonstrating urls, one domains email servers deliver, aren‚Äôt clogging someone else‚Äôs inbox using it. two doses it‚Äôs still giving 92% protection hospitalisation. public Health England. Hahaha people saying trust China? China covering screw up. blind stupid see that. Still, allow social groups regions open pre-vaccination, even new variant.

Like example, family friend circle vaccinated, there‚Äôs less risk meeting together now, whereas pre-vaccination, even delta variant, could lead super spreader events. everyone spread reduced 88%, that‚Äôs unlikely happen.

Likewise regions high vaccination rates almost certainly lower incidence spread. Whether that‚Äôs enough make areas ‚Äúsafe‚Äù fall anyone‚Äôs guess point.

It‚Äôs regions highly unvaccinated hammered worst (as would expect). one shocked news /s  serious journalists work free? What's throwing bit here, experts disagreeing quite bit terms impact vaccines global pandemic overall. 

For example, Deepti Gurdasani mentioned article. lecturer epidemiology UK quite pessimistic, saying evidence ""vaccine escape"". well known virologists saying incorrect assessment, cautiously optimistic, although think Delta concern overall.

It's infectious disease expert Vs. economist easy decide trust. see experts disagree strongly experts makes think situation quite air moment people really know. 

Right I'm leaning towards listening infectious disease virologists / immunologists, feel would know Delta interacts vaccine immunity. SA, throw 2 million J&amp;J doses allowed fully produce vaccine due patents etc. such, US company contaminated production throw vaccines. allowed produce vaccines would lot along vaccination. US EU vaccinated enough people considered patent waivers vaccines self interest others. negative side, UK might trouble herd immunity unless people vaccinated AZ get revaccinated mRNA vaccine, since AZ's efficacy low. like shops posting signs masks longer required, please respect continue wear them.

There still immune compromised people cannot experience full benefit vaccine, along anyone cares continue wearing masks caution...just one example Ah yes see. man culture well.  suspect feel urgency lock vaccines soon came market. time realized needed vaccines asap, countries already got line ahead them. all. rubs wrong way people make false accusations vaccines thrown away age group restrictions vexatious Draconian.

So no, I'm setting record straight. Yeah. I'm angry countrymen every single day now. continue endanger infant reason. (the exception fears relating past inequality medical care relating racism) Smallpox eradicated massive international search outbreaks, backed vaccination program, starting 1967. organised co-ordinated World Health Organization (WHO) unit, set headed Donald Henderson. last case Americas occurred 1971 (Brazil), south-east Asia (Indonesia) 1972, Indian subcontinent 1975 (Bangladesh). two years intensive searches, proved last endemic case anywhere world occurred Somalia, October 1977.

That doesn‚Äôt mean live US you‚Äôll dealing COVID 2023, official designation COVID pandemic won‚Äôt drop then. 

The rich countries virtually done COVID end year. there‚Äôs still Africa needs vaccinated, many countries Mid East, Asia, South America, etc. we‚Äôve made bigger strides there, still fit definition ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù instead ‚Äúepidemic.‚Äù worth noting UK also big differences vaccination rates, look figures London boroughs 30% less full vaccinated. course lot likely due age demos boroughs themselves. also take account risk getting infected Covid-19 Taiwan lot lower compared many places. old fashioned way let enough die herd immunity reached

Where people get idea herd immunity easily reached letting people get infected? 

I can't think major viral disease ever reached herd immunity without immunization. much want disagree limit folks outside me‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ truth. Go outside enjoy world. lot nice places near you. Explore find something new. Social media definitely blame, but, people. social media platform turn people blame.

They way control kind phenomenon censorship controlling people put out, slippery slope. opinion really time people stop blaming social media, least fully, things happen. essentially fault society (people), social media tool( know complex that).

What actually though? idea.

I‚Äôve told medical practitioner it‚Äôs apparently affecting children adults. Whether that‚Äôs they‚Äôre vaccinated it‚Äôs nature strain, don‚Äôt know. Last week 126 covid patients hospital 2 fully vaccinated, weren‚Äôt vaccinated (there‚Äôs certain sections society refusing vaccines seems ending hospital). 

Like you, I‚Äôm sick shit.

Yates attorney got fired following trumps orders nothing highest respect her.

I think said cause thought Americans would otherwise run grab masks leaving none healthvare workers since president time anything save masks workers.

Unfortunately us, Americans still ran bought masks healthcare companies used words masks working cdc lack action provide masks healthcare workers also forbid workers even using masks bought themselves. said would ""scare patients"". tons articles healthcare workers getting fired refusing work without masks. happening fauci say thing healthcare corporations actions.

I care intentions. lying us lie, word longer believed without scrutiny except idiots unfortunstely seems people days. see rule; wanted create discussion. Lesson learned next post, mods allow, I'd like extend actual discussion that's happening rather dwell title, possible. Thanks. Filed ‚Äúwell, duh‚Äù. Ah that‚Äôs really good point, useful refinement :) thanks Haha thread fun Yeah. seems like countries use metric looks better, really relevant metric. think percentage vaccinated total population used. predominant data suggests variant higher risk hospitalization, spreads easily bit better breakthrough infections.

However, vaccines still work well them. There‚Äôs cause panic.

Both things exist time. article pointing real fact Delta variant isn‚Äôt good isn‚Äôt automatically ‚Äúsensationalist garbage‚Äù matter much want put hands ears remotely negative news. fact remains, media also reporting, vaccines highly effective Delta. favorite whole ‚Äúyou still get vaccine‚Äù reality is: also still get covid wearing mask Right you. grandfather died birthday COVID-19 back January. hospital bruised hand following fall. lived alone. likely explanation caught hospital, discharged, admitted virus. got second shot, hospital   wrote detailed covid vaccine explainer Subunit vaccines (raw vaccines involve directly injecting antigenic molecule. called subunit vaccines antigen one piece whole pathogen. sars-cov-2, reasonable choice antigenic molecule spike protein. itself, spike protein cannot cause infection, missing rest virus, particular virus‚Äôs vaccines generally manufactured creating recombinant cells (usually bacteria, sometimes yeast, insect, mammal) contain gene spike protein. cells grown harvested, spike protein purified (In theory vaccines could manufactured growing pathogen directly; case, conceivably improper purification sterilization could result vaccine accidentally causing disease.

You simply need worry getting COVID San Francisco right now, especially vaccinated. virus almost nonexsitent right now. 

But that's true everywhere. Germany 35, likely gotten offer vaccination official way either. much solidarity. add - probably already know this.

Neither volunteers studies people administering shots knew whether getting vaccine placebo. behavior two groups systematically different. Especially case asymtomatics, study shows correlation causation. lot supposed long covid symptoms common among populace begin even pre-pandemic, adding stressors unhealthy lifestyles (eating lot junk, exercising, stress, lack socialization, depression) exacerbated year restrictions, widespread health anxiety top that, believe study shown sufficient causational link asymptomatic covid symptoms, far know self reported. Except fully-vaccinated person Calgary died delta variant... 


Similarly, study review revealed doses, **Pfizer vaccine showed 88 percent effectiveness symptomatic disease caused Delta variant compared 93 percent Alpha variant.** **single dose either two vaccines, vaccine effectiveness 51 percent Alpha variant compared 33 percent Delta.** effectiveness falls 50 percent efficacy threshold FDA set designing safe COVID-19 vaccines; vaccine prevent least half vaccinated people getting COVID-19 symptoms.

Get vaccine doses either Pfizer moderna people.. important follow Yes Yeah stories seem like bit reach me.

Who ""many Canadians Europeans"" article a) traveling tourists US right b) clamoring see specific show?

I think magnifying glass first Broadway show open. policy likely revised international tourism ramps again. I‚Äôll honest, didn‚Äôt read much it. said radio asked questions unrelated Covid vaccinations don‚Äôt want anything. You‚Äôre getting worked nothing. article stating objective facts situation new variant, sky falling need million boosters lockdown. projecting fears onto article explaining scientific reality new variant. room both? Validate friends feelings losses also speak situations far worse? feel heard also might even feel grateful (and sympathy others) losing perspective. Yeah shit. aint getting vaccinated anytime soon either.

:( goes argument you‚Äôre wearing mask awful polluted future you‚Äôre makes feel unique special live. many times posted now? I‚Äôve seen multiple times row every single day days row. shit-tonne influenza-A around then. Really? Why? stupid want around. They're danger others walking/driving likely they're dumb. Throughout whole pandemic help wonder would different churches used considerable influence organizing power support masking social distancing. Imagine churches organized mask sewing distribution people without homes, delivered food checked elderly folks community. chance getting hospitalized virus vaccines 0%..

This misinformation. Stop it. see I'm vaccinated? Community cooperation good thing. kind government mandate fight. always wear seat belt strongly disagree seatbelt laws. allowed ask questions show concern variants. asking questions seen forever lockdown/mask wearing group. person sick symptoms, stay home.

Person might covid variation flu. nieces nephews vomiting/diarrhea fever days, fine. Basically bad flu ahhh interesting, thank you! gets harder harder love accept selfish people.

Well upvoted comment one vote override million ones lol.  seems heavy handed. vaccinated get covid? can't get shot medical reasons? one know variants impact kids? Fully vaccinated small kids can‚Äôt  None technically ‚Äúapproved‚Äù. emergency use approval, different. mean percentage entire population fully vaccinated currently 45%, mean eligible adult population hit 58.2% today. 

The current cases growth exponential, less exponential 10 days ago. want data someone math.  assess intelligence? give IQ test something? dismissive Delta variant mistake. I‚Äôm predicting huge surge anything Delta variant extremely likely dominant quickly US. hopefully half population fully vaccinated doesn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôd huge surge cases. it‚Äôs impact TBD. many times thing going posted? I've seen least dozen times past couple days. Efficacy relative risk. variant highly infectious, 95% efficacy could still mean likely catch covid. thing goes hospitalization. turning discussion something isn't. People saying reason concern fear mongering. believes delta variant take us back March 2020. emergence suggest things peachy hoped for.  suggesting test more. correcting redditor cases fact dropping. know true percentage positive dropping. Yeah, real. I'd say 98% people social circle family least one dose point, still alive well. I'm pretty sure vaccines deadly we'd know whole lot dead people. know natural immunity longer (large number patients infected march 2020) know covid vaccine induced immunity (mass vaccination outside clinical trials started Dec 2020). 

Whilst post vaccination patients may higher antibodies spike protein, important notice actually showing better real life protection. There's data back claim vaccine immunity protective natural infection induced immunity real world. please share I'll keen read. Wait. Someone died covid fully vaccinated?? UK changed death statistics combat issue. Instead deaths covid death certificate, changed to, deaths (for reason) within 28 days positive covid test meaningless statistic own.

In ages dying, ~98% people vaccinated. 30% actually minuscule proportion vaccinated group compared unvaccinated 70%! think what‚Äôll happen eventually countries adopt approach people completely vaccinated vaccine WHO-approved list considered good go. im still wearing masks indoors im middle lot friends. dropping masks entirely, others still wear outside idiots Facebook backwards ü§£ Propaganda? tried getting burned stake heresy? happened. see ABC interview? even contradicted proving knew time masks indeed work right telling people didn't. even sounded like shaming people thinking would help. time telling people wanted keep masks health care workers. work wanting use masks ""don't work"" health care workers? Hmmm. Watch interview.

All I've said he's liar. lied. Noe cdc president stuff anything fact lied masks beginning pandemic. English translation tale two parents. One treated Guatemala's public health system private hospital. outcomes tragic worthy read. One striking takeaways challenging public health system keep medications stocked. periodic shortages drugs used intubation since first wave. Families relying public system choose pay basic medications like fentanyl, versed sux go without intubation. case family given prescriptions shopped around medications cost $450 per day -- greater monthly minimum wage. That's virus done. mutated transmissible. 

Viruses always mutate become less dangerous. virus' reproductive cycle unaffacted becoming dangerous going feel selective pressure so.

And mutations incredibly new anyway. timeframes events long. Decades more. you? Funny exact age group government trying pimp vaccine sudden one new variant spreading in. Get fucked. Well, title, written, wrong. study never talk antibodies, analyze differences antibodies T-cells. looks number T-cells, type characteristics. fair bit off. many people wanting get vaccinated one main reasons we've taken long go age groups. Yes, I'm positive. drink water also. 80% 18+. That's important distinction wrt herd immunity. Never claimed be. Um,We Japanese may look polite surface,(especially older Japanese)But cannot tell actually thinking....

Not non-Asian,Many Japanese hatred towards Asians.Also POC.(Somehow many Japanese tend forget yellow.)Japan makes convenient machines whatsoever,but people,we good.

(P.S Animes..

[Stop Sexualizing Culture truly, Japanese  cursory skim study looks identification T-cell epitopes. Nowhere say mild cases likely cause long covid severe cases, mention asymptomatic cases. don‚Äôt lot faith AZ personally, think wrong move. messaging vaccines interchangeable, not, shouldn‚Äôt set restrictive policies around specific brands. isn‚Äôt fair. People got AZ good faith, treated way. 

My veterinarian got JJ, also wouldn‚Äôt take JJ, give hug today first time since covid started. (She knows I‚Äôm fully vaccinated.. Pfizer anyone cares). likely covid? Yes. treated way treat fully vaccinated people. 

NY going far. plenty data AZ, isn‚Äôt random vaccine. mistrust scientists govt? That‚Äôs really root problem. get people see making one mistake 100 way better alternative sources make 50 mistakes 100? Notice people vaccinated flair less less threads? Actually big debate whether teens vaccinated not. JCVI yet recommended teens (under 18) vaccinated since emergency use authorisations risk age group miniscule add spike protein spike protein already contracted? know. might want wait see long natural immunity lasts one think know yet. ""who cares unvaccinated, I'm fully vaccinated let's open up! taking risk lives""

Yeah, kidding. millions campaigns relied ""won't someone please, think children!?!?!"", one instead started back beginning many many people side ""It's cold."", ""Kids get covid badly."", ""That's parents. kids."".

These kids, damn, put lives hold probably *more* rest us. kids still Pandemic Jr. edition mode, fully vaccinated. then, plan wearing mask situations, solidarity them, show adult adult. First, get vaccine, important!! Second, story true. COVID Breakthrough cases admitted hospitals even resulting deaths.

[CDC COVID Breakthrough can‚Äôt discussion? insane push disregard everything Lab Leak. Literally can‚Äôt real discussion show evidence without labeled conspiracy theorists. Well interesting development... tell last 4 months friend mine got twice. went got vaccine soon could. Honestly know that, cool. 
To original point though, layer water top ice, really ice wet, water top ice?  people think vaccines prevent every single case COVID, somehow means vaccines prevent infection all. ""you too"" Ôºà„ÄÇ„ÄÖ¬∞Ôºâ  Yeah‚Ä¶I agree. shouldn‚Äôt approved without data.

My comment topic bit rant. needed vent. appears others didn‚Äôt appreciate much. Fear-mongering ""variants"" new hip thing. (Even though major vaccines effective them.) 

Rather saying ""get vaccinated move life"" get hear FEAR FEAR FEAR. generates clicks sells iphones. 5 Unfortunately, know church. find asked either. spoke contact tracer assigned case. would divulge many flight tested positive. I'm guessing church group helped spread it, speculation. indeed mainly ones without masks. 2 members ones coughing flight without mask. good assumption came them, knows. can't mad. worn N95 damn cloth mask. thought protected vaccine. put wedding 2 years thanks covid. Ended small ceremony central America. Tested negative day flight ATL. positive got Virginia. since 20+ people flight infected, pretty clear that's got it. fucked up. joke. theatre full vaccinated people would real concern AZ vaccinated people there? herd immunity two main paths herd immunity COVID-19 ‚Äî infection immunity reached enough people population recovered disease developed protective antibodies future major problems relying community infection create herd immunity virus causes  **Reinfection. It‚Äôs clear long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19. Even antibodies, it‚Äôs possible could get COVID-19  Health impact. Experts estimate U.S., 70% population ‚Äî 200 million people ‚Äî would recover COVID-19 halt pandemic. number infections could lead serious complications millions deaths, especially among older people existing health conditions. health care system could quickly become immunity also reached enough people vaccinated disease developed protective antibodies future infection.** Unlike natural infection method, vaccines create immunity without causing illness resulting complications. Using concept herd immunity, vaccines successfully controlled contagious diseases smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella many immunity makes possible protect population disease, including can't vaccinated, newborns compromised immune systems.

you know talking about. Chill dude. common refrain certain subset affecting people pre-existing conditions 94% people die covid whatever bullshit put together. I'm trying point ridiculous sounds. 1-2 days intense flu like symptoms equal stress outcome (getting covid symptoms) specific person same? Ice wet skate it.
