0,2020-06-22," feeling somewhat rejuvenated cases started drop rest country fine but, despite NYCs numbers, seeing rest country got slumping depression again. start ""reopening"" sports, Broadway, concerts, museums, bars restaurants like 25%... know sounds superficial like things make NYC NYC coming back significant fashion long time.

And since work one industries literally idea I'm getting back work. I'm fine now. Unemployment lifesaver. starts get spring 2021 still know we're gonna problem. everybody. Definitely time nuts blossom. article interesting cults like, often easily verifiable fact believe in. kind purity taste. believe X verifiably false thing, member group, person would believe that. People long acceptance feeling like part group. overwhelmed... Bc locked down... be. That's also victory! celebrate that!

It could still happen remain vigilant. people could saved, bc treatments mentioned, be. That's important remember locked first place, must moving forward avoid potential tragedy.

Wear masks. Distance. Practice good hygiene. mean, insurance right out-of-pocket maximum right?

* 10 day course remdesivir like $10
* steroids expensive
* tocilizumab used widely treat rheumatoid arthritis

Those drugs got cheaper 2 weeks intubation + drugs keep induced coma :/  ""there small sub-section doomers, like sub-section anti-lockdown folks""

I think *massive* subset folks overlap groups highly assessed recognised such. (Folks believe mitigation impossible resign losing around 1% populations this. They're fatalist defeatist virus gets). Sounds bad, Im happy UK! I'm glad getting cases down. keep I've staring setrac data odd.

The last 7 days ICU data spiked covid patients, yet total ICU patients steady.

The last 2 days new suspect cases dropped 1/3 amount confirmed cases increased. Amazed people think masks going stop this. friggin kidding me? sheepified?  Please show study masks proven stop covid transmission public places like beach, street store. fall IgG months also normal infections bodies clear. question high antibody titers remain protection. Nobody really knows. second wave know (once correlate residual antibody levels susceptibility reinfection). also unclear strong (T B cell) memory response bodies mount. find soon guess. matter interesting - guinea pig experiment doesn’t feel great.  Yeah. right. Nothing done. /s here. awful Congratulations BLM protesters screwed everyone. Yes outrage justified good path ruined flex gram. Sure, doesn’t mean IFR isn’t lower. one virus puts 1 10 hospital another puts 1 100, 1 100 one spreads like mother fucker, easily overwhelm hospital insane number cases.

Let’s say 100k cases hospitalizations late March. 8.7 MILLION cases, means 1% cases go hospital. 1% FUCKTON cases STILL cause insane deaths hospital overflows saw.

A virus optimized spread+ exponential case growth+ even 1% hospitalization rate= saw March husband's aunt flying Illinois 2 weeks Florida wants see us I'M bad guy saying no.... can't. 

They're coming town see husband's elderly father. can't think worse idea right FLY FLORIDA visit elderly person. keep getting angry every time think it. Well could saw coming. Nice job fucking Fort Bend Harris county tard Houston! Although many businesses failing cooperate. could maybe air condition stores offices 65 degrees F, please? sound advice! anything, desensitization made precautionary. I’m leaving anywhere without mask mini hand sanitizer, definitely agreed. Stay safe x2! I’m injecting sunlight, thank you. Desantis looks like grown cabbage patch kid.  examples contract tracing already.

It's fear-mongering. acknowledging large gatherings people spread virus, matter ideology people gathering. Or... bodies covid get incubate, higher likelihood mutation. Yeah, short attention span short-term memory loss required good American citizen nowadays. 

Right China enemy, that’s state focusing moment. China took manufacturing jobs. (we supposed forget willingly gave businesses could cut labor costs.) [(R) states don’t higher incidence unaccounted excess deaths blue reality, quarantine home that's mandatory, one gonna check you.

Here live, wanted really enforce comes comes out, would put checkpoints major highways leading metro area (I-35 near Gardner, KS northeast Liberty, MO, I-70 starting Bonner Springs KTA turnpike exit I-70 east Oak Grove, 50 Highway east Lone Jack, I-29 northwest airport, K-10 near DeSoto, national tracing 

National tracing America complete joke would ineffective due shear number cases (2+ million confirmed, actual number asymptomatic cases people get tested could well 10's millions point, etc.). would impractical.

No one live really enforcing anything. business usual. Even gyms open patrons wearing masks, etc. Fuck that. I’m religious man, I’m praying every deity ever learned does. There’s outside chance one listening. Many people even tested positive. subreddit full self-diagnosed people symptoms persist months months representative what's actually happening. wanted move America long, done happened. Smh go girl! coronavirus nightmare every level  Oh kk. honestly would expect month That's million-dollar question. Admittedly, great answer you.

I data analyst professionally however.  know things:

(1) One worst things analyst believe ""what forever.""  

(2) One worst traits analyst ignore numbers fit current hypothesis.  

Fact things changing. late-May, *very strong* correlation (a) daily deaths (b) aggregate number cases previous 14-21 days. say strong correlation - R-Square 0.95+! highest looked aggregate number cases previous 15 days.

However, relationship broken *completely* mid-May onward. correlation 0.95+ *negative* correlation. Negative! 

Viewing things mathematical guy, that's really remarkable. 

So need new way thinking predict # deaths given # cases. worked March late-May work well anymore. excessive...I feel desensitized fortunately, virus affected life one single way except missing annual trip highly recognize lucky for. feel desensitized traumatized absurd. Could’ve saved shock. It’s one wtf moments marks entry adulthood. realize simultaneously don’t know shit neither anyone else thought did. seemed pretty sure couple comments ago. kinda sadly. would karma abysmal handling outbreak, 122k+ people got killed. Apparently americans like die stupid causes. Here's data...collated official want challenge them, burden proof you. accuser data manipulated. prove that. That's justice 101  really need CDC finish large scale serology studies. PSU estimates seem loosely fit NY serology study results, think numbers ballpark. Remember, results time period right lockdowns, i.e. virus spread peak. virtually testing March, March tests caught tiny fraction cases, 1 80 seems possible. current testing regime much better public health interventions significantly slowed spread virus. I'm pretty sure, results reflective current conditions., i.e. we're currently detecting far 1 80 cases right now. human isn’t crime. human country illegally makes illegal. I'm sure ""Study"" comes see possible. Many protests wearing masks social distancing nearly nonexistent. may little early say whether impact. We'll see coming weeks. 

Another thing ""Study finds""... study? political slant done non bias group. We're told that. saying... problem many areas parties, gatherings, living like 2019 didn’t stop Memorial Day, kicked off. device that... blows... air...

Some kind advanced piece technology, perhaps rotating blades, powered electricity, could improve air flow room... 

Eh, give up. I've never seen admins announce 100 accounts banned ban wave sort. literally tens thousands accounts. Fingers crossed majority us still read it. something become problem travel. current problem something could arrise boarders travelers become reckless lot people say government control, think racism. people joked Asian people wearing masks long it.

Racism always hill die on. Basically life support feel important intentional making time special. would easy absent emotionally check distracted make conscious effort present kid. think BLM reason positive cases United States paying attention. misinformed. family staying home 95% time since march. assholes thinking? *(not including brave amazing essential workers)* Texas, Arizona, Flordia today?  Wth limit them? ""Give up?"" never even tried begin with. Yeah, ""if take New York numbers"" people sure quiet now. really talking undetected cases 80x detected ones, would shown serology studies even antibodies last 2-4 months.

None larger studies found anywhere near number. could agree this. left clients office, stopped Roseville mall get Lego friends bday. signs everywhere saying mask far could tell, stores would give mask didn’t one. different went mall 3 weeks ago. walking, everyone wearing mask security guys telling people put masks. Saw several mask hanging face part people wearing them. Apple seriously checking people’s temperature letting people get line certain way. 

Across streets Fountains though? one person saw wearing masks unless going Whole Foods def weren’t keeping six feee rule :-/ I’m back Bay Area masks worn almost everyone. yeah... wondering small convenience stores every one breathes air without aeration Interesting, never class 30 others especially one popular teachers needed elective. sure schools manage area ECMO? fair fairly typical flu let lick hand touch surfaces lot people touch, lets fucking covid killing air system works not. still refuses push back opening. Guess nearly 5000 new cases day increasing hospital rates isnt scary enough him. Actually, US probably many cases, unable test early on. Peru country world population least 20 million people higher rate confirmed cases per capita United States. I’m almost 90% sure he’s already it, gave Brazilian delegation Mar-a-Lago, got mild case, got it, feels it’s waste time. chance death high, medical bills might covered... Unfortunately seems far gone turn back. Politics taken appearing economy human lives. Yeah real, quite people outside Hawaii wearing mask/mask worn properly makes mad. lost opportunity good job going delayed even since people keep dumb Trump already get vaccine something? seems like he’s worried getting infected. [California Hits New High COVID-19 Tracers Struggle Get People Answer Phones Would Hard Link Coronavirus Spike Recent COVID-19 Contact Tracers Asking Protest Participation, Despite Fears New Virus (not sure California, idea there)

For reason headlines experts, try portray protest ""safe"", i've compiling posting stories following stuff, i'm sure ""safe"".

This surge protest, multiple factors. things massive events banned, except protest, unique category .

Exponentials take ramp up, 1st gen maybe 2nd gen infections events (as detected), get 4th gen begin see surge. Right, there's connection scientifically. conjecture fear mongering point contract tracing proves connection covid-19 spikes protests. three weeks, Minneapolis experienced spike yet. Rip peace husband too, truly looked like die days. ELI5 - countries like Italy allowing tourism outside EU, able book flight?

Will turned away land Rome book flight USA? reckon he's already symptoms tested confident catch Well, use freedom have, partner'. that, recent Chinese study shows antibodies acquired china’s strain don’t seem work European mutation. It’s Arizona. boredom part really makes think paid there. going get worst... stop it, Nov places well Uhh, no. not. That's linear growth.

That would mean 1 person gives 1.00001 person average. That's linear.

Rt 2 means 1 person gives 2. one people give 2 people...which 4. 1,2,4,8. That's exponential. difficult appropriately resource something pretend widespread. work? Like, mandatory 14 day home quarantine random police health worker check-ins national tracing database something like that? ""Just slow testing."" That’s weird stat crow about. Aside Brazil country many infections first place. includes countries 4x population US. extraordinarily crappy job containing first place. 

We’re eventually going 2,000,000 recoveries infections anyone else begin with. It’s almost like mods agenda. 🤷‍♂️ trump stop testing? would've thought listening medical professionals years training would beneficial everyone.... sources that? so, wouldn’t almost every office high rise pointless opening don’t want spread it? suppose Ai tell us humans wear masks? homepage information ranking works . 
The worst probably name since really ""how safe"" country is. well countriy prepared crises, actually reacts (especially government) could system handling spread (tracing, quarantine,..) 
Well mean still flaws way better going worldometer Dashboard JHU simply comparing numbers. countries lie isolated getting way much credit. 
Here [methodology](http://analytics.dkv.global/covid-regional-assessment-200-regions/methodology.pdf) . Many scientists thinking ranking quite reliable. good America. Latin America become worst number cases rapidly growing July. 4.37% 4.87%. I'm saying due testing, cases definitely going up, states increasing cases CA one best positions. could started two week ago? Hmmmm Masks may correlated measured though Yup. :( don’t see it’s realistic extras there’s vaccine. That’s lot time producers adapt world without them, there’s little reason believe go back status quo if/when happens. Covid situation may accelerated something hanging like dark cloud part business years now; technology reached point make extras computers nearly cheaply hire real ones. Snorting bleach preferred option May. impeach Newsom rally Sacramento Sunday. rally, mean literally one guy 3 kids standing corner waving sign. kids looks said “were indulging it’s Father’s Day”. number masks worn protests appears escaped you. Asian countries: fucking shit dude coincidently read article today outlining lessons South Korea learned MERS H1N1. Apparently competent leadership, planning well executed, decisive action almost fully contained virus there. Who’d thought....? watched video someone sneezing. fucked I? win refuse digest bullshit feeding you. one wants take guns. talking point. Guns abortion keep voting best country. really think will. gonna go year without seeing them? Ohhh...thank you!! appreciate explanation. makes sense. bad Canada's economy royally fucked moment. time worried people actively courting death well everyone else's.

When people start asking illness death, pretty much thing said ""...uh, well, ask it."" disease soon carried away Mexico Cuba really want America safe easing COVID-19 restrictions reopening economies states. People wearing masks nose probably wearing condoms testicles. Oh nod Jack Thompson? even know coronavirus respiratory illness going news that's fed you?. Reports say affects brain , heart. point enough say nobody knows severity disease. assume poor health eating garbage , obese fucked. healthy people , dump processed food live natural guess. Rant enough masks medical professionals. major part narrative early days. Let's act like narrative virus roller coaster.

There literally cases people buying masks selling hospitals profit. people forget things? Can’t also theoretically make worse? mean improper handling seem become germ collectors (from knowledge). 

And since viruses survive pretty long time even stuck mask? Wuhan officials, December 31st, advised masks general people might believe abuse involving gags restricting airways common either, even may try shame someone experience, subsequent mask aversion, may even try pathologize know nothing person went through. needs study way sure correlation due random chance.

That doesn;t make sense. [Correlations due random want show causal link mask-waering public health outcomes. something paper fails way. example, paper finds super strong correlation government income support COVID mortality. want advise income support? arguments can't make advice based study, make masks well. less state put coronavirus patients back nursing homes, fewer coronavirus deaths had. Yeah honestly fail see good news. people infected COVID die many do, many recovered cases means lot deaths. 

Heres analogy - ***Imperial Japan propaganda 1945 :*** Good news everyone! **650000** people survived nuclear bombings! ***Victory imminent!***

Recovery numbers start good news new treatment methods help significantly lower mortality rates. likely country requiring masks it’s also taking measures reduce virus spread. really ""No fucking duh"" moment Nice try. get head ass wake reality! also think way people greet east west lot spread virus. track effective tried true treatments flu. covid decidedly not. whole idea ""weather storm"" meaning slowing infection point hospitals overloaded.

We never going drop infection rates 0..

Hell... Think virus spreads... handful people pass onto dozens hundreds thousands.

Staying home stop handful people passing on, cycle.

In end, everyone get Corona like everyone flu, hopefully next year vaccine lessons death rate. Unlike religious institutions west nonexistant power, pakistan, mullahs significant power authority. rally insurgency government forces win fight. government weak cannot risk defections military bc possess nuclear weapons. circumstances go religious establishment. Masks protect others you, way around. Beijing getting business closed. Prepare million COVID-19 test kits city. N95 mask better (ie surgical cotton mask), mask really going protect you.

I think provide source this. sure. mom 70. got haircut fine. Looks good feels good. Masks distancing etc get Hold stopped injecting bleach? Damnit missed memo. Doubly sad, Arizona benefit watching go NYC.

Triply sad, NYC also benefit watching go NYC.

Over again, places horrible spread YET seem think somehow special happen here. would say that’s difference using face mask Lol. Heads up. 0 around ears. 2 everywhere else sweet. 
That’s 6 week haircut. “2•. That’s 1/4 “ length.

You totally won’t sorry. Happy late Father’s Day. It’s do. countries criticised fighting first disease crucial them? California dumpster fire right now. Record setting case levels every days hospitalizations time high. Newsom boot lickers like testing.  Absolutely. is, 10% survive devolution. cases imported India.  Malaysian here. confirm me, definitely shifted ""new normal"", use cliche, I'm less acutely aware nowadays. understand scientific studies work. one trying determine causation. analyzing looking association; correlation.

Now masks could well (and likely does) reduce spread COVID19, presence correlation certainly evidence favor that, however study prove causation. Latin America motherfucking corrupt country poor population, low income lack hospital usage. UV light might. Outside... guess don’t see urgency someone high risk closed space exposures. people huge rush get hair salon. would waiting longer. Yet doesnt block particles virus What’s mask argument? thought pandemics it’s good idea wear one? wouldn’t want wear one pandemic? personally get dizzy nauseous feel like I’m going pass wearing one. tried grocery shopping remove finished afraid passing ambulance called couldn’t afford pay for. even idiotic, certainly dont need medical mask. make piece appropriate cloth yourself, old t-shirt something. hard. cloth mask can't stop virus particles, stop droplets.

If someone breathes you, droplets get mask. they're sitting right front nose mouth, virus particles go mask. still *little* protected droplets landed directly face, much more.

If infected wearing mask, droplets get stopped mask, get people's faces. completely eliminate risk spreading virus, drastically reduces it. hate shit. smug fuck confident citing tweet. SoCal, Arizona, Texas, Florida - bumpy ride.

What's ""wrong"" Alabama, cases decreasing trend? Lt Governor uring old folks go die economy? Looks like that. What's disconnect Gov? sorry experiencing  China lied number cases deaths. know many people died virus. said though, seem able contain virus. Something countries able do. Wait second, feel way variables take consideration post like population size, density, demographic politics etc. didn’t read article think people passing article didn’t either came post bullshit like me. I’ll put sensational clickbait bucket. Also, cool dudes wear masks. “Bad dudes” wear cooler masks. bummer. husband surgeon Orange County, CA I’m worried that’s headed. 
Good luck there. ""I can't believe anyone revises opinion based facts. Science failed us.""

At least, try approach determine coronavirus landed shores, and/or regions China. anyone stand trialing one region? rona reinfects Brazilian bat population, rages back north fall, expect higher death rate. sure, centralization, lack od respect people rights, willingness population accept factors certainly help prevent spread virus.

Im sorry, rich seeing liberals inside insulated walls Reddit jerking eachother intelligent respecting science are. respect science makes feel good loathe doesnt. Another example: Guns good. stunning discovery. shit common sense Time vaccine test cure COVID-19. guys making excuses. hundreds thousands protesters around world course people wear masks around chins like see many photos, wear masks all, carpool together inside small enclosed area, go public bathrooms, etc. 

It's science protests spread covid. Whether guy ended spreading even matter. protests spread covid wait happen prevent it.  Vietnamese, proud country don’t know corona virus viral load theory cannot applied viruses case: 95%

Locked border end Jan China, close school right lunar new year, forced people wear mask get fined, F0 F1 F2 cases get quarentine, F3 F4 get put list case. mention also lock building even street back March? Oh, hospital capital also got locked 3 weeks got discovered 15 cases?

Even Capital got locked 1 month start April.

Now live Vietnam 0 dead cases, football stadium thousands viewers. dad’s family side work capital hospital shit bad know.

This communist party might dictator bad corruption least know fucked people health revolt come.

Bad englando sorry guys. Aka parents :l infuriating many times I've explain people. also means million die; true. I'm r/SETX share sentiment. thought gonna tell us ... nevermind. heard/read day think spike southern states might part due tempature rising driving people inside a/c. sounds like assuming system works. Never assume system works. Great response!

Only think I’d critique still first wave according experts. middle fucking pandemic Trump hosting mass gatherings, he's encouraging people *not* wear masks. 

Is trying lose election? he's still stepping up

In defense can't even wanted to. Deaths lag quite bit, 2-6 weeks. takes die good hospitals.

Also young people less likely die, seeing lot infections population Something nobody seems bring want bring outcome gets infected? direction downplay rhetoric finger pointing snap contracts virus tried four plus months see rug?

Not single fiber believes change tune rather lash left, minorities, antifa, whatever boogeymen think of. wouldn’t put past accuse one groups deliberately infecting him. goalposts keep moving? conversation hospitalizations rising that's concern - talking capacity field hospitals. No. One. Wants. That. That's point. increasing hospitalization particularly ""we're highest we've ever been"" problem. Pretending like not, downplaying got mess begin with. basically want everyone infected stay sick forever. way hospitalizations spiking, way daily new cases spiking — surely public understand spikes continue, additional measures going necessary make sure maintain health safety people state Texas

Yes, I'm sure public understand. Afterall, federal government, Texas government, conservative media done great job disseminating high quality, scientifically sound information. Every day there's article masks. people dense topic? barrier better nothing, single fucking string wool front mouth better nothing. island nations provides effective boarders therefore able fully enforce quarantine controls. US: assault Asians wearing masks

Vietnam: laugh 0 death spread it.  I'm still thinking lot 'don't wear masks' stuff government afraid people would use PPE needed hospitals rather data community transmission, well political reasons like optics asking people wear masks thought might lead panic still trying play things down.

So yeah, lots reasons CDC governments would say stuff masks raw data prevention spread. Oh good, starting run gas - French Covid know guys made mask political issue, piece cloth front face orifices, nobody touching intimate parts taking guns. 

 Well, probably shit CDC advise helped, country got mask bandwagon like 3 months ago. 

People use face shields street, even think little much. Also standards cuba top 2,000 cases 85 deaths they’ve closed borders best doctors world low? US made habit putting people charge disagree scientific expertise...? say things undermines much support truly has. reason first place hahaha. like laughing barely fill stadium, meanwhile bet presumptive candidate 3.5 years ago people making exact comments. He's worried COVID-19 all. cares harvesting antibodies victims disasterous policies. acceptable before. 

Sad entire administration got lot people killed needlessly. History remember ;D  Tell hospitalization rates two weeks I'll believe it. attempted lead people feeling contempt masks social distancing, leadership terrific. best leadership I've ever scene. Yeah look satellite photos ground carparks near hospitals may actually virus 6mo US, [Harvard /s actual fuck..... ... prayers. 

I'm atheist seemed liked right thing say. Yes blame CDC 

Totally ignore sitting president talked stupid masks past 4 months present day

Totally ignore didn’t order ventilators end march

Just pretend didn’t shortage PPE

Forget fact Trump told everyone would gone easter

Forgot said campaign rally wanted SLOW testing Lt. Governor saying old people would die could fuck Applebee’s $1 margaritas? 


I’m paraphrasing, course. frustrating. Imagine here, seeing friends family going out, drinking together, going weddings... matter time loved one dies isolated death. Likely more, states report recoveries People America really thought great summer lol. might depend live. I'm AZ &amp; national news spikes here. great state recovering, think there's fear hearing states recovering means areas recovering, getting worse, means people stop taking seriously, stop social distancing &amp; go like started. Again, happy &amp; state, scared here, I'm seeing numbers spike people thinking dropping now. jannies seem get entire thing ultra-political. RIP probably lot states haven’t revealing recovery numbers also isn’t including people quarantined home recovered there. What?! Life changing. eternal gratitude ♥️ math check out. Yep, even better news: Sun rise last morning.

Just imagine, bad would not.

Sigh: news, 100% expected interpolation previously known trend. love boomers, millenials, zoomers get memed nobody remembers gen X Tragically one side made politcal issue. mix fractions addition letters!!! WTF?

Chaos! Dogs lying cats, numbers letters fractions! end world! town second highest single day new case count whole pandemic...
Hopefully thata anomaly.
Remind three weeks Praying Brazil❤️ love Chicago means things way worse advertised. DeSantis literally caused genocide state. jail awaiting stand trial. know, last time required root police tear gas. Let's hope try ignorant? China largest population density world. well known unsanitary living conditions makers. also litter help states shut health care systems overrun. Situation sucks. Thanks saying this. could learn ask questions try understand views others, rather focus convincing they’re wrong. tried couldn’t see pattern except many also mods corona subs.

Lot shut in's Reddit probably think race war brewing reality everyone protest united State violence. ""Not downplay illness, I'm gonna totally downplay illness throw misinformation.""

The CDC provisional death info posted anyone cares read it. even include flu deaths age group easy comparison. COVID proven far deadlier influenza every age group 14. Glad posted. 

The US still takes flights, yes, doesn’t mean take one. saw many planes fly home today.

My gut feeling still think it’s bad idea transport via plane, especially hear saw news.

Astoundingly stupid. pathetic water wet thought slow coz trying get olympics going, adamant going ahead tried every possible make happen, that’s news made sound like anyways crude mortality rate New York state 0.16% -- count excess death ILIs. IFR 0.19% would mean 84% residents New York state already coronavirus infection. still posting hundreds new cases / day currently strictest mitigations United States.

If still need near-lockdown 84% infected, going ""herd immunity"" sane strategy? That's well north 500K deaths US, probably least 8-10 times many people weeks long illness costing 6-figures medical cost.

By way, that's US right now. Going herd immunity. Reopening uncontrolled outbreak that's scope contact tracing **is** herd immunity strategy.

*If is* low IFR thus high infection rate, already late switch gears, there's zero chance vaccine making difference even ready Jan 2021. (though immunity relatively short lived incomplete still glad vaccine) believe science also homeopathic remedies help sometimes. It’s “one size fits all” situation. Well, cure type stupidity.  I'm sure thats true, especially we're talking surgical and/or home made masks.  need cleaned disinfected somehow. 


If we're talking N95's KF94's something like that,  check manufactorer feel half titles sub written Onion. second thought, maybe ineffective general public need commercial pilot license use them.

Seriously though, number people see fucking simple thing keeping piece cloth mouth nose touching dirty hands astounding. breathing compared regular surgical mask?  Yeah, I’ve seen respect IL I’m really proud pulled off. cases aren’t super low they’ve seemingly plateaued weeks decline locked early seem reopening right way. I’d say 85% folks city 150k wear masks stores, I’m glad got required masks thing nice early. 

Here’s hoping entering Phase 4 week won’t set us back. Well still factually incorrect. agree views 45% youth voted BJP, mean they're old people. /r/India echo chamber views the""other"" side downvoted oblivion. Especially Australia NZ! Oh wait... whatever nationality have, safely assume 318 cases ;) zero death, that's butthurt deaths Yeah 100 degrees Arizona. Nevada. Florida. 
All record high cases today. yesterday. every day past 2 weeks. deserves sooooo much worse Remember Southerners mocking NY NJ? think they're laughing anymore. Thoughts prayers.

I’m telling truth numbers stuff. idea means. herd mentality thing works there’s repeat chance get still don’t info on. I’m individually taking stance need wear mask least there’s proven sense something working. zoom meetings 2-3 times doctors across country honestly say, last 2 months, heard one new bit information proves anyone knows still dealing with. everyone always wore mask nobody would sick. fault get sick wearing mask. Thailand. We've successfully weathered pandemic despite government initial complacency. They've bad they've amazing.

The thing Bangkok already wearing N95 masks going bad PM2.5 pollution. complete frakking idiots. One bar Discord political circles? discourse Sweden must sort Orwellian version it. Afai understand it, point touching partly *you* potentially virus asymptomatically therefore accumulating virus particles mask breathe it, touch spread particles everything touch after. OK re-adjust mask (as minimally poss) hand sanitise first (so transfer onto particles may picked surfaces) &amp; immediately after.  know. number people blindly believing ""discovery"" without using logical rational mind simply amazing. paper masks help all. would imagine cloth masks similar paper masks surgical masks.

If wearing cloth mask, shaving facial hair almost certainly help much. wearing N95 mask, shaving would defeat purpose using N95 compared say surgical mask. covid. I’ll never forget said doesn’t spread person person Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

The analysis pretty worthless. approach cannot establish causation, correlation. likely important factors correlate mask wearing controlled for, prior SARS exposure (which changes people's behavior sure).

What study done consider time dimension make panel study. could show causation. cross-sectional study little meaning. stupid fucking opinion. even explained people country, fucked. father exactly describe three years ago. called pneumonia. used agree......and read horror stories Balkans &amp; Syria &amp; Burma.....

meh. 

i think true solution is: greater socioeconomic equality across groups. 

Think Switzerland's handling 4 main groups 'Informed good guesses'? attempt humor? Spain 9.7 ICU beds per 100k, Italy 12.5, US 34.5

They've officially denied aiming herd immunity. former official wrote Facebook, come official sources. yeah know else could aiming for, sure told us. Funny thing stop flights China Italy enforced wearing masks ""there's science back effect"", herd immunity? fucking science backing herd immunity would work?

I'd happy send ear saver little snug (and also gentle ears). Well, I'm Vietnamese seen nothing transparency regarding government actions. infected cases well recorded. information every person infected public updated daily. Every time someone gets released hospital, there's always broadcasted footage doctors staff congratulating giving gratitude back. I, one, believe them. rest country. mean, we've basically back normal without mandatory wear mask almost two months dishonesty would completely fucked now. true recently. we’re starting regularly see 5k new cases day hospitalizations highest level, period. far haven’t gone much, growth continues may end back Corona beer campaign give free mask every six pack buy.

Happy cake day btw. :) may causal relationship masks COVID prevention specifically, observational study demonstrate that.

Countries fast mask adoption also coincident restrictive measures populations generally compliant.   almost slow spread virus, kill many people. Amazing Hmmmmm never required masks Australia basically beaten it...? evidence, based evidence like decisions made safely re-open. Knowledge power. know Alabama one state changed way counting cases downward trend lockdown measures seems continue longer. Congratulations! solved second level Abbott's house riddles...

Straight russian playbook. people act tough say masks pussies, adult face diapers 🙃 Yeah Googled saw January 19/20th. first death February 28th. assume person first contact January 20th ship (possibly boarding, one initial carriers) subsequently died February 28th would 40 days minimum. Diamond Princess population also massively older average extremely high viral load conditions. Also week long testing backlogs deal with.


Who knows 🤷 Ok point? NEVER know true answer. comment alone puts sheep. Theres nothing exept live life . sitting reddit places making statements like dumb. Everyone blind dumb powers never be... Get Perhaps measuring infections unreliable using deaths proxy infections. 

But sounds like unreliable statistics surprised researchers point themselves. 

Otherwise bad science.

They could also measuring two different types people's. something countries easily get millions people wear masks within 2 weeks notice makes things different countries people turn armed protest masks?

Are perhaps generally likely respect social norms? follow guidelines self quarantine, hand washing, keeping distance etc. Maybe gave incentives it? Like kindergarten teachers give little kids colorful stickers things like washing hands putting away toys? Greg Abbot? every single time without exception. state underwater cases, yet economy continues reopen like nothing happening. know revenue system aim sound pessimistic it, sad see quickly things heading towards ""normal"" cases rising. 

Theme parks pushing open keep hitting new highs. Entertainment last thing wide open midst growing pandemic. roads lead 'rona. Well agree disagree. Interesting - wonder also indicative countries took seriously therefore better social distancing etc well? Hard prove course bozo coin

I'm stealing that! He's supposed wearing mask, that's enough dispel doubts.

It's better careful. Yeaaahh lot states showing [worryingly fast trends last couple weeks, including states like California. existed mighty nation more... “I’m sick covid” crowd ruining us. Thanks trump lost popular vote 3 million. 

There greater argument abolish electoral college fact gave us reality TV star majority country want Florida Man wins another Stupid Trophy collection Stupid Shelf. mother smart cookie. Two? Lead poisoning would explain it. Companies going that. companies trainers, engineers, HR leadership, shared regionally? Shouldn’t invest local talent rather forcing travel? agree everything seems fairly clean, general. holy hell, rarely see anyone (men I'm male) actually wash hands using restroom, even taking deuce. do, follow using dryers, lot places thankfully turned off. Nah fam. Masks work, unless worn healthcare workers. least that's country claims. Yup. Totally disaster waiting happen. Even Florida must hate Florida. Wet water excuse used slavery. simple solution: clean hand soap sanitiser adjusting mask touching face. also advisable tighten elastic band e.g. tie adjustable knot side.

It safe wear washed purposefully sanitised clothes running water washing powder removes particles loosely attached surface clothes. Theoretically also wear washed washable facemask (please wash surgical masks N95 masks, delicate handle washing) without sterilising it, touch outside contaminated i.e. infectious particles already attached surface mask. Looking UK now, 

What UK now? Boi glad live Australia. Sorry, I'm following. ""influence US politics like it""? I'm understanding mean ""influence"" ""like it"" statement. Unless wear nose exposed 🤦‍♂️ would headline!

'Florida man spotted something rational' Japan take seriously probably well mainly thanks masks. sheriff principled person would refuse duty, would resign. job enforce law regardless personal opinion. wasnt possible March, unfortunately. wasnt enough supply general public. polite!  not. Germany introduced mask alone without measures due federal structure states introduced one week later. Perfect case study mask prevented roughly 10% infections. stores closed heavy social distancing. forget theme parks reopening too. Disney set reopen July 18th I'm sorry. ""local outbreak"" ""local lockdown"" meat packing plant...  good see, hopefully provide blueprint localised lockdown would work Europe.  

Obviously lockdowns perfect solution, done. Leaning towards gets pardon Pence and/or escapes Moscow life-in-luxury tbh. Military little insurrection him, withdrawing troops Washington without disclosing first, see feasible way repubs overthrow given ever-decreasing public support.

There definitely concerning time there, keys power, he's going able hold it. true, would effect lock-downs 1.5 3 months instead 2-4 weeks.

It's likely early cases misdiagnosed, brand new disease takes spread population arriving new country. hits critical number people, increase cases rapid predictable. early stages handful people country infected, there's lot chance involved takes time spread enough people. 

Even point, places relatively hard hit population apparently unexposed. Hospitalizations definitely increasing, tho. age groups 45 years old currently seeing higher daily hospitalizations previous peaks April. 45-54 year old group almost back point. 55-64 65-74 year old age groups lagged behind younger groups climbing again, tho ways go reaching previous peaks. age group yet appear climbing 85+ group. trying influence US politics like it. Hand washing bad still think accurately representing majority people. Though live far Tokyo.

But even true places much clean sanitary anywhere I've experienced. Restaurants, combini, supermarkets especially bathrooms. much spit reaches you, tinier droplets, mask seal nose side face tiny droplets easily swirl gaps breathe in. surprise UK (English) government either know care currently want reduce social distancing 1m order help pubs restaurants reopen.

Someone passing 1m away outdoors pavement probably little zero risk.

Someone passing 1m away supermarket aisle probably little risk.

Spending 15mins bus train people 1m away higher risk.

Spending 1-2hrs restaurant crowded pub people 1m (or less) aways probably even higher risk.

Southern US states social distancing basically gone little mask wearing shown spike Covid-19 cases amongst young. It’s easier said done you’re working 100+ degree heat day. We’ve people job pass bc can’t breathe masks enough. Everybody pulls they’re around people. ESPECIALLY older ppl work place. We’ve 2 cases. January 20th. Here's full chronology: I'm glad detailed official map like all, darn near useless mobile. none things matter you... really? Florian Kohfeldt shown link? Super random. Last time indian claimed cure based drinking cow piss bathing cow poo... vast majority people. stop spreading lies.

Oh can't gather 50 people? huge impact people's everyday life. quarantine. could go pleased. People visiting bars restaurants like normal. ones voluntarily, like fucking wrote. prefer mine conventional masks. Easier breathe thru doesnt fog glasses. respirators get difficult breathe thru canisters start getting clogged dust paint. glitter body hair Oslo, sometimes smart masks esp. grocery shopping tight areas like Grønland .. 
If anything, there's harm! Wait plandemic now? may wrong place post, goes-

Even family doctors advising going hospital fever cold beds chance contracting covid earlier. tell tips maximize chances recovery catch virus finally go hospital fitting properly. use ear saver hold better. incinerate clothing Italy first outburst West managed contain it, new York worse happened month later. Rest Italy close zero. new York first city West get would much worse, given situation Italy well “Better English please! know one language last time took English freshman year highschool!” Yeah, definitely would nice. originally impressed UIL back beginning closing state-wide competitions quickly. Netherlands disagree, still awaiting research results. Because, know, borrow country's wheel reinvent it? Hong Kong country. 

NZ low list. Spike cases death. Younger people get immunity. message remotely shared levels government. would lead higher levels mask usage lower infection rates. Higher testing rates leading higher infection rates masks used. look Canada, testing rates rising weeks infection rates lowering widely adopted mask usage. 

Well, trust government also big difference USA Canada. live NRW, I'm locked all.

America’s leading grandma killer. People strange. problems required license carry lethal weapon, literally arms something changes, unlike grew up, highway patrol stop seatbelt violation. Mandated safety *is* norm here, yet enforced mask regulations. due actual cases increasing due testing like in, say, Sweden? Imo article poorly written. author contradicts almost every point made beginning paragraphs stating exact opposite afterward. author wrote catchy headline copied pasted wording bunch different articles written since February generate content clicks regard presented. Sad. 

From article:

""It’s common contract Covid-19 contaminated surface, scientists say.""

Same article: 

""High-touch surfaces like doorknobs risk...""


From article:

""And fleeting encounters people outdoors unlikely spread coronavirus.""

Instead, major culprit close-up, person-to-person interactions extended periods. Crowded events, poorly ventilated areas places people talking loudly—or singing.. maximize risk.""

Same article: 

""One important factor transmission seemingly benign activities like speaking breathing produce respiratory bits varying sizes disperse along air currents potentially infect people nearby."" 

Just two examples many contradictions statements backed actual sources. ""Some scientist say"" ... ya OK. official trustworthy. Thanks thanks. France, beginning Covid crisis, gov. told people bother wearing mask respect precaution needed wearing/removing correctly mask... Countries introduced masks early also inteoduced plethora measures early on. says masks effective measures? That’s what’s bothering heard home made masks arent effective. wonder people dont trust read. much conflicting information Plenty stories first started nonbelievers realized mistake caught significant ICU. June time next anti-police protest! that's still happening know local one lasting 1st July. pointing know many people interested headlines. Nobody restricted travel. Bars, Gyms indoor sports mass gatherings forbidden. Happy help :) Skin game means people get care. one likes seeing doctor. mean number Munchausen cases someone like seeing doctor vanishing small... OK sorry trouble. definition 2nd wave technically still 1st wave nationally? Mericans odd sometimes, although love you. Spain, 100% compliance masks experience. 90%+ even mandatory. Wear avoid inside spaces possible, really difficult. I've seen everything, racism thrown reason people take virus seriously wrong. idiot. hope people stop idolizing POS. antiwax stances sharing nonsense misinformation COVID19 organizing tournament early spread virus players wife player pregnant. Shame acknowledging ICU numbers going down, yet fail acknowledge increased cases due testing? There's something said unified, national response takes threat virus seriously instead of...whatever fuck here. probably without lasting immunity either, making impossible ever reach herd immunity. true that’s I’m talking about. NY shut subway, canceled school public events, instituted stay home order mandated homemade face coverings least couple weeks actually anything.

Instead, deblasio urging ppl go restaurants. later, shit hit fan deblasio wanted shut schools, cuomo said absolutely bickered inevitable. 

The reason 2 aren’t universally reviled US Trump admin response insanely bad, stupid malicious incompetence NY mayor’s governor’s early actions pales comparison. expecting humans show multi-step thinking say ""okay deaths severe cases know, others, simple?"". collective average intelligence probably bit higher cow. never get western countries look masks. Yes, first low supply, aren't. Wear them!  Unless artificially selecting deadly strain pulling severely sick troops trenches exposing public strain allowing mildly ill stay fight, highly doubt it. That's known ""speaking moistly"", coined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Technically filter resistance N95 masks mmH2O, whereas resistance KN95 generally less 10 mmH2O, that's based answer upon. Also, widespread testing increasing denominator. beginning, people extremely ill thus likely die getting tested. think may contact someone contact someone contracted get tested. PPE, seeing patients.

If can’t safely, 100% support all. Apparently puking guts plus bruised skin. little kid potential cause stunted growth worry parents well. Luckily latter happen, I'd like think could even taller without dex :D matter what, matter who, worry see danger. we, human love, do. terribly surprised snowbirds decided say fuck stay friend got thrown trash France Asian.

I really hope racist arsehole got COVID-19 ignore basic epidemidology science want, one care.

If wish ignore experts data remain ignorant that's you.

But stop making bullshit statements. global (and US) new cases trend going fatality trend going down! that? treatment getting better? New drugs? inaccurate reporting? businesses need open now. really simple. government providing assistance choice health economics. Lots Estados Rojos there, wonder why? Netherlands aswell, masks mandatory trains since little stores crawling people without masks. Yet numbers look positive. visiting Germany astonished everybody wearing masks like normall, yet numbers quite good moment. Really makes think actually effective not. fact public health officials believed would better/easier lie make sure healthcare workers masks government make sure enough masks produced says lot flaws economic system public health officials, opinion. 89 million left out?

So, outbreak, Finland treated non-mask country study. Agree, polling indicates hardly anyone Finland wearing mask. Stay tuned. blacks definitively systematic racism.

US build sidewalks, blacks use them, destroyed public transports, black using builded highways around black districts keep there, similar stuffs. moving forward extremely slowly. mentioning harsh laws caused many children fathers need them.

For US probably C19 especially handling it. Western world really expected US crisis like that. economic research power... Damaged economy also may cause deaths C19 itself. athletes specifically, says 30% admissions show early stages irreparable ling damage leaves one breathless Yeah, pandemic perspective medical industry masks little technicality. people know nothing insisting science proves masks stop one contagious diseases planet near perfect efficacy.

I know Reddit (and especially sub) fosters extreme viewpoints instead balanced rationale, sheer number people genuinely believing proven scientific fact everyone saying otherwise science denier incredible. Yes, agree points. say UK response perfect, pretty much country say clear even remotely like Boris current government power disagree ways things. also agree lockdowns could implimented bit sooner perfect scenario. virus reached UK couple weeks places like Spain Italy. peaks late March, early April week two later. course known would problem still one first major epidemics actually reach us major way quite long time.


All I'm saying awful everybody keeps saying, UK nowhere near bad US there's reasons negligence deaths bad. virus kinda reached UK couple weeks places like Spain Italy. peaks late March, early April week two later.

I'm Scotland virus much issue, Scotland double digits per day cases. exceptionally well slowly lessening restrictions (even slower England believe, even though cases much worse).

Not sure UK whole Scotland there's meant mandatory mask usage public transport, bus drivers enforce it, there's really way police enforce it. Although reason literally implimented within last days. “I figure, want safe, safe,” said Robert Stevens visiting Southwest Florida. “Wear mask want.”

Churches packed Sunday...thoughts prayers. far, Spanish ministry health openly admitted that, yeah. ill dig up. ty. understand point? course run absolute risk? Oh google “UN sec general lockdown” UN plenty criticisms lockdowns negative effects right website. going “cherry picking” follow rules. approximation rounding ""lying"".

It truthful, period. honest thing would appropriate information. open border Sweden – certain regions

That's title article. choice words. Quote said, news said. Try again. article: taking country emergency footing — sort “lockdown lite” lasted month half.

Article dated June 2, mid-April policy went effect. know people living there, told initially nobody followed guidance. somewhat shocked. 

The lack physical contact could also big reason, agree that.

My point science lends credibility wearing masks. Multiple studies concluded strong correlation mask usage spread disease. claiming wearing masks factor, point virus rise (late February / March) example, Japan, quick implement factors yet see rise transmission, hospitalizations, deaths. First time July 2011. Wikipedia (march 2020) says no. 1 281 weeks overall. Pete Sampras (286 weeks) Federer (310 weeks) longer no. 1 imperfect make nothing though.

Most fear mongering unfounded speculation, data clearly shows masks help worn correctly. lower seroprevalance virus front line healthcare workers cleaning staff Birmingham's hospitals, demonstrating PPE effective.

The negative side effects pure speculation. harder get mass mask use virus become normalised, think precautionary principle says gone masks early on. idea many epidemiologists focused potential negatives rather potential positives. Given guidance shifted favour masks, think obvious wrong.

Even supposed negative effects mostly argued way 'masks make people feel safe' vs 'masks remind people vigilant'.

Additionally, could y'know educated people, rather focusing negative consequences 'wear mask nose never touch on'.

(not think masks actually important factor sufficient isolation, headline could easily say 'countries acted earlier suppress virus, better suppressed virus', always seemed obvious masks reduce transmission non-zero amount, fairly desirable). exponential growth works. start one viral particles, takes 10 doublings reach 1024; start 512 particles, takes one doubling. start lower innoculatory dose, immune system time detect threat mount defense. start higher one, virus likely overwhelm immune system defense mounted. presumably medical professionals much higher CFR general population. Uk came first. herpaderp would incredibly hard enforce New York many people cross border New Jersey Connecticut every day Yeah, people criticize get people listening podcast him. Joe Rogan especially intelligent insightful things say, get people open up. ""we can't stay forever 

Do people know places go besides bars restaurants? able go eat Olive Garden make prisoner home. starting look lot like NY....their cases per population nearing NYs max, testing hard come by, hospitalizations spiking. arent NY levels yet (NYs positive rate around 40-42% peak) getting scary. NY lockdown - AZ wide open... 

Stay safe AZ peeps. Lock shit -no one top level cares you. need look family. almost certainly legal authority, although wish did. Yeah, WA choir one originally referring to, also others in...Amsterdam France, think? definitely check articles out. ty. need put mask away short time I'd recommend landing paper towel something contact table whatsoever Gee... could seen coming? Oh yeah, everyone. Fucking idiot governor I’m trying say lot factors can’t determined right lore learn expect. know two mice chance bred mice could mean handful mice. won’t know end there’s high confidence possibility. It’s black white there’s exact statistics there’s high possibilities based certain factors. America seems seriously considering herd immunity first. over-dramatic, sensationalized statement like this, telling teachers going die give PTSD. Shame you. call Djocovid extent, course. people still worked normal. entire prefectures chose close schools. Virtually one went remote everyone's boss 65~80 quite understand internet is.

Comparatively everything supermarkets pharmacies closed Ireland 2 months, people allowed outside house beyond 2km even shopping one solitary exercise.

Yet 1/28 population Ireland twice many deaths. course Ireland supposedly one best counters Japan pretty bad, probably closer even close per capita.

And even chose countries make point, hometown town. Yet seem much show masks make huge difference reflective general government responses.

Of course think certainty. way many factors can't imagine account for. Sadly, won't. get next year 50% fucked.. get one time bye bye CARES Act include forbearance, people don’t know mortgage servicers shady honoring no-fee/proof hardship 

The forbearance fannie/freddie backed mortgages. lot homeowners make much subsidized loans. example, mortgage conventional relief whatever bank america feels like granting fall behind payments sister bar tender Dallas. exposed last week co-worker hers. Tested weekend Negative COVID, positive Antibody point it. said extremely sick, nasty cough 2 weeks back February. agree messaging, think that's global issue. people demonstrating outside public health officials houses, threatening insane. Yeah, people like continue work home front line healthcare workers, essential workers, politicians, athletes, etc get quicker return ""normal"" keep economy going. 

Additionally, every person becomes immune either getting virus getting vaccine brings us one step closer herd immunity. 

So even takes us long time get everyone vaccinated, society improve drastically people need get quickly. comment literally nothing point I’m trying make. Thank you, it’s difficult types discussions moderators don’t allow it. Much like movie, control machines created people thought best everyone we’re arrogant listen.

 practice, “no politics“ role simply used remove comment don’t like selective enforcement. question moderators’ policies ban critics snap fingers. realize isn’t anything anything about, might well know full context removal got much attention.

 way, thank taking time talk us, Arizonan near California border life pretty insane helps respected public figure give us clarity. know plenty macho people won’t wear masks stay distant, show Arnold change minds expect. recommend people work home possible? stay home symptoms? Ah interesting. Thanks! Honestly happy see posts like this. started following/obsessing COVID19 Chinese New Year video Wuhan doctors spring festival celebration WEIRD. lived China years lots videos like that, haphazard hurriedly done, watching didn’t inspire trust.

So I’ve sitting months - started isolating family March 13th - waiting majority people, even maybe majority minority reddit, take seriously. sad news fact anyone cares amazes me, point. whole western world failed catastrophically. 30,000? Please, United States gets week. better step coronavirus game So? still run absolute risk getting virus. matters? injected more, even smarterer! hope makes greater percentage population yield scientific expertise. 

If use experience learn trust experts create policies accordance suggestions (rather immediately questioning accuracy/intelligence experts themselves), hopefully lead towards productive climate change conversation. Thanks. right. place seems like half astro turfing straight idiocy. So, giving testing problem, probally alot cases Iran reported? can't actually see getting kind transfusion given [his irrational fear sight someone link lasting effects study?

Yeah, Flordia CA start looking like New York State April, put stop it. see similar comments lot, seem ok without masks Netherlands. guy Trumps problem really lack empathy, also intertwines lack interpersonal communication skills. basic level, people like feel dumb.

Good lord. gonna take risk, needs risk something better Outback. ;) Again: want people getting sick novel, dangerous disease taking reasonable containment measures try prevent that. seems impossible understand done trying explain you. say would risk it? .....


O boy... google xD better stated another thread, NY back March stop May. Pre. Existing. Conditions = USA

FOR PROFIT elderly care shady business practice = USA Sweden hasn't? EU closed EUs external border. Well, technically recommendation EU countries implementing. also plenty slow spread corona. They're talking positivity rate COVID-19 tests, 2.5% entire state, that's lowest ever been. say time. Tomorrow whole new day new level embarrassment achieve, don’t jump gun early! intends slow testing Yeah area many others covid deaths. NY many thousands. I’d rather stop seeing NY plates regions since NY covid problems, us aren’t crammed cities. Extremely dangerous! You’re god damn right 🎩 would unleash Twitter storm biblical proportions. live theory case actually many government restrictions place long. first place country institute stay home order way back March 16th even plenty restrictions (no indoor dining, can’t try clothes stores, county state level mask orders, etc.)

People fed social distancing now. Since can’t go much friends time. Even though masks ubiquitous indoor public spaces open (as legally required county long time), can’t imagine many people wear homes. neighbors massive party live band last night figured must awfully bored people party like Monday.

As much admire government’s efforts stop virus beginning left us population low level immunity high level frustration fatigue. Well that's excuse Shit. Anybody seen ""data analysis"" Josh Ketter suggests virus overhyped shows lots data believes supports position. Check fired data scientists new site instead speculating excess deaths can’t proven Covid Oh, that's smart. Put bunch people may coronavirus room together bunch people may not. could possibly go wrong? realize following CDC guidelines time right? state governor this. Tell me, would done shoes?  Wrong wrong wrong wrong, wrong wrong wrong wrong. They're wrong. many issues logic here. Among them:

1. Seroprevalence studies, especially ones conducted earlier pandemic, badly flawed.
2. Antibody development way people immune virus. viruses, even important one.
3. Asymptomatic cases always produce antibodies virus, person may well still immune symptomatic case.
4. Either ""spreading undetected large numbers"" early pandemic, nearly contagious thought. One true. That's math. contagious, herd immunity threshold goes down.
5. idea herd immunity threshold virus. varies different viruses. equation (1-1/R0) produces 60-70% estimate based particular epidemiological model (SIR) several unlikely assumptions simplicity (that populations uniform susecptibility transmission ability). likely lower. much lower know. flu all, death rate wise that's exactly is.

Not sure focusing stronger, someone else wrote bit tongue-in-cheek, took issue with. [We know know wrong yet. multiple times higher mortality rate. far demographic slicing, really seem different, something else CDC link tell you. What? getting paid? true, asymptomatic also damages us, appearances slow moving ele. Going outside masks seems close totally fine. issue folks wanting return indoor spaces without masks. think eventually find masks... believe it. remedy sight quarantine, get I’m getting tested. test looks way uncomfortable tell there’s nothing do. 

Severe cases probably people get tested. Isn’t obvious especially timeline, protest wave hitting?

It doesn’t seem obvious. Philadelphia, DC, Boston, NYC’s protest waves...? announced Monday would close chosen close temporarily two things – implement program eliminate lines, modify HVAC system install air purifying technology remove 99.4% COVID-19 virus (including viruses, bacteria mold) air conditioned re-circulated,"" restaurant said Monday Facebook page.

What miracle purifier? 'soft' lock down. People still go daily necessities. People still going public greenspaces. Wuhan city hard lock government food drop offs door absolute quarantine. Even relaxed temp hospitals fully staffed running.


And honestly would people rather express admission emergency care, wait line forever sure get doctor appointment. actually watched tape doubling saying kidding, there's really room interpretation. clearly says intends slow testing knows he's saying. that's goes long-winded rant we've done much testing countries. supporters still convinced somehow joking talk testing means supports testing. well no. doesn't. he's trying cover ass simultanueosuly telling everyone he's going slow testing. basically he's saying much testing nobody praising instead they're attacking he's going quit. Notice never said none could affected. said it’s wrong tell kids teachers die. 1000s streets criminal media turns head matter Yeah, doctor (Hahn?) say ""no comment"" question came him? could've swore that's sounded like watching live stream. people stay home couple weeks, even manage that. referring clearly says"" assume case fatality rate among individuals infected SARS-CoV-2 0.3% general population — mid-range guess Diamond Princess analysis — 1% U.S. population gets infected (about 3.3 million people), would translate 10,000 deaths. **""**and clearly assumtpion total dead case 1% infection US population 0.3% fatality rate. hard president thinks. 

Ftfy Also add this, ones sent ICU hospital finally getting tested. Hence death rate appeared much higher beginning, weren’t confirming COVID-19 patient’s already advanced state. 

It ridiculous trying get test back early March. sick time, cough relatively high fever since hadn’t recently travelled couldn’t “prove” recently contact someone diagnosed (how hell would even known that?) couldn’t get tested Corona. sure not, kind doubt point regardless symptoms present couldn’t get test time. heard rubellla measles bad fetus, preagnet. Yeah. would awesome. keep looking South Korea envy.

Unfortunately really need federal buy-in get something like done. Never knew Hawaii big rat problem feel way terms risk Los Angeles.

It's ironic probably safer Los Angeles two months ago spike cases. 

I realize one purposes shelter place avert kind medical meltdown occurred New York looking future, nothing would change behavior reasonably prudent person. guy forced nursing homes take back COVID positive patients almost half COVID deaths occurred nursing home patients... better secure borders! guy full great ideas. smart choice NBA play there. Odds didn’t January US Wow usa really fucked Reminds Roman guy made dictator Rome twice times crises, gave powers soon crises resolved.

EDIT: Dude's called yes, Cincinnati (indirectly) named him. check fired data scientists new page? trust numbers either? 100 deaths, 5000 cases both!? Believe Pareto would correct 20% 80 % feel end homeless starving due shitty government policies, might also increased chance catching covid. Might theory homeless makes harder self isolate. Yup. know much system nurse saying prepared. matter. takes week 2 restructure entire hospital turn covid ICU. Unless hospital systems dump patients onto. 

If already, need stop elective procedures start moving non covid patients make room surge. BuTMyFrEeDoM Maybe give Canada money build wall... argue people list requirements wearing masks correctly (never touch it, wash hands every time do, wear new mask every time, etc.). wearing mask nose mouth every time indoor public space can't socially distance 80% job. We're looking reduce transmission rate, operate using full hospital sanitary practices. make seem way complicated, people bother. Since cases going now, watch week see deaths start rise. Can't take care parents work 40-50 hours day. news outlets reporting daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people  on rolling 7-day average 6.25 6.08, Sweden's real numbers 4.91 4.95, respectively.

Not more. ran numbers latest FHM data, rolling 7-day average deaths per million people May 19 May 20 5.02 5.08 respectively. average week May 12 May 19 5.82. Oh. point is: able 14 days quarantine home return Sweden? not, may AWOL job fired. tried explain example.

Note letter case Region Syddanmark. Public organisation managing hospitals certain part Denmark. Even March thought that. knew enough testing, plus asymptomatic cases.  culture touching people much faster greater willingness wear masks. Oh man, live Boise here. amount people wearing masks astounding especially social distancing. numbers climbing hitting 100 again. Broke record cases day Boise today. Heck we’re moving back stage 3 reopening phase. really country go stage one. flu still cause it. measles.  not...they tested protesters mostly asymptomatic. think came 97.5% negative? ""Houston, problem...""

Someone say quote. opinion person really matter. poor taste, unfunny joke represented serious statement. live world POTUS thinks that's acceptable topic jokes rest political world stupid see idiot bad standup pandering base. Alternate theories:

I'm ready. Trump going poop pants Americans gave jobs Chinese cheaper want them.

Americans problems manufacturing jobs. less slave wages companies follow environmental regulations US they'd rather pocket money they'd spend put cancer air water. simple fact people willing pay price products made workers fully developed countries.

Of course are. (and do) time. problem US far many people making less living wage dependent artificially low prices. Companies also making money hand fist pocking obscene amounts profit. Many companies could keep price products making less money still make healthy profit, greed king. nice meltdown 'I'm thinking sending ~~death camps~~ long-term care facilities'

\-Mario 'death olds' Cuomo. Looks like grad school Paris. Reddit becoming twitter day Yup, too! :D really 

Trump 100% said testing makes us look worse. followed **but it**

The media, does, misrepresents facts pretends Trump said less testing.

Trump makes fun media claiming told people stop testing.

The media tried claim doubled people saw knew obviously joke.

Then asked it, Trump explains told people testing makes us look worse joking that, reiterates never told anyone slow testing.

Sooo...the media pretends told people stop testing.

Fauci backing truth  Lol, country around 4 million people low key panicking starting closures 30 cases today. Can’t wait til rent car, never leave city, still get stopped. think people able stomach churn able see close relatives years alternative ever seeing outside headstone label urn. I'm merely pointing HIV malaria good examples huge world-wide vaccine effort bear fruit.

I personally think SARS-2 vaccine available year (and is, general public see quite time), better use pathogens examples. IIRC polio vaccine took something like 20 years. Anyone watches Fox News exclusively.  New York State Executive Law, Section 29-A coupled Executive Order 202 ([pdf declared State 1. …the governor may executive order temporarily suspend statute…if compliance provisions would prevent, hinder, delay action necessary cope disaster necessary assist aid coping disaster. governor…may issue directive state disaster emergency declared following instances: …epidemic, disease outbreak…. directive must necessary cope disaster may provide procedures reasonably necessary enforce 2. d. order may provide suspension particular circumstances, may provide alteration modification requirements statute…suspended, may include terms conditions

New York State Public Health Law, Section 2120 1. Whenever complaint made physician health officer person afflicted communicable disease carrier of…other communicable disease unable unwilling conduct live manner expose members family household persons may associated danger infection, health officer shall forthwith investigate circumstances 2. health officer finds investigation person afflicted menace others, shall make file complaint person magistrate, complaint said person shall brought 3. magistrate due notice hearing, satisfied complaint health officer well founded afflicted person source danger others, may commit said person hospital institution established care persons suffering communicable disease maintaining room, ward wards persons.

While section specifies magistrates, executive law makes clear governor may modify law necessary. Various parts regarding requirement complaint, investigation, hearing, etc. could outright suspended.

Ultimately, make argument quarantine unconstitutional, unlikely succeed, given [Compagnie Francaise de Navigation Vapeur v. Louisiana Board upheld situation nearly identical proposed.

It announced March 25 Prince Charles tested positive COVID-19 wife, Camilla, tested negative. Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed symptoms virus despite Sophie Gregoire Trudeau suffering fever uncomfortable symptoms.

The question people fall ill others don’t one researchers working answer. one likeliest factors health individual immune systems.

“So might stronger immune system makes less susceptible becoming infected makes resistant infection,” Dr. Eleanor Fish, immunology professor University Toronto, told CTVNews.ca phone interview Wednesday.

Everyone’s immune system reacts differently exposed virus. Someone strong, healthy immune system exposed virus may become infected, may become infected show symptoms. compromised immune systems elderly considered higher risk dying COVID-19.

Some doctors suggested Trudeau may already coronavirus symptoms. Trudeau tested virus, doctors recommend testing people asymptomatic.

In Camilla’s case, Dr. Fish said it’s possible proper hygiene could’ve played role negative test results. However, added it’s entirely possible Camilla could test positive later.

“There many examples families one individual becomes infected … proper hand washing, touching nose mouth, actually prevent transmission within family,” said.

Recent data suggest men likely become infected coronavirus women. Dr. Fish attributes trend fact women generally much robust immune response infections.

“And makes sense females carry, they’re one carry fetus, need protected,” said. “So shouldn’t surprised males females becoming infected.”

It’s important understand that, someone doesn’t test positive coronavirus show symptoms, mean somehow immune. point, little known immunity, though experts believe people recover virus experience period immunity. Precisely long immunity may last still unknown.

“What meant immune? means you’ve exposed virus before. newly emerging virus infection,” Dr. Fish said.

Experts anticipate could take least year vaccine developed properly tested. then, one best things people individual level maintain proper hygiene eat healthy, balanced diet.

There foods vitamins prevent person getting coronavirus — virus, matter — immune system bolstered eating vitamin-rich fruits vegetables, according Priyanka Mishra, postdoctoral research associate Simon Fraser University.

“Indirectly, help,” Mishra told CTVNews.ca.

“We cannot say eating certain foods protect coronavirus. help produce certain type components body help fight infection. interconnected help boost immune system.”

Ibmve since read whole paper - China identified early mask wearing country.

If saying China low deaths... doesnt fit narrative.

My point is, study looked c. 10 different predoctive factors deaths -masks, population density, etc,etc. found itbcould explain 55% deaths.

One racrors masks.

Masks wasnt strongest factor.

Masks wasnt policy choice.

""Masks"" primarily based 18 coiuntries temhey conaidered early mask-wering countries. 4 highly impacted (Philippines eg), 14 bottom 99 countries. small countries. compared 181 countries included model (which predictive power overall c.55%).

The HEADLINE calls masks. stronger impacts. impacts. model weak-moderstively predictive... masks. doctors say otherwise

But sick? 


Has determined whether asymptomatic carriers spread it? They've contradicted themselves. long see states going up. can't understand wearing mask political. Canadian here... waiting government grow fucking balls same. Enough month month bullshit. Many experts believe Brazil surpass US end July cases deaths. Governors look like start taking action US slow spread. Brazil hand, middle reopening reverse it, Bolsonaro organise anti-lockdown rallies force governors give  Maybe northeast, cases consistently going leveled going down. cdc thinks third asymptomatic. i've seen numbers 70 percent Make America................oh forget it!!!!!!  telling lead COVID spread? Wish NJ NY people early on. amount cross two states makes unrealistic. Lots people flooding shore towns NY. Yeah test conducted. False equivalence.  Even think we’re gonna get anyway, still want slow spread much possible. ICUs get overloaded, healthcare workers burn start making mistakes, fatality rate shoot up.

with due respect, really though. Texas even ""lockdown"" period, Governor said ""but essential businesses remain open"" reeled list essential businesses page long.

Right Reddit, read real lockdown looks like, dude France. things open groceries, drugstores medical clinics. people allowed home people working 3 kinds places (and govt workers), people going 3 kinds places. reason, even dawdling long, ticket fine.

That's America needed, got. failure Federal leadership lead states competing reduced revenue meant rushing reopening. Considering Texas Children’s Hospital Houston start admitting adults area hospitals full, think time “tougher action” already passed. Incidentally, time time started relaxing social distancing restrictions. what's science? that's fake news! deep state conspiracy make dump look bad! r/nothingeverhappens Oh god, I’ve trains that’s last place anyone would want sick suffering US states little COVID months ago they'd border controls USA national spikes across country we're seeing today.

In theory, actually did, enforced. Also, border restrictions would metropolitan areas vs rest states inhabit cases made sense (like Kansas City area, Cincinnati area, Lousivlle, metro area whos suburbs surround areas expand one state). Kansas City area, lockdown orders Missouri Kansas side state line happened tandem other, also much population lives one state, works another. theory, someone living Olathe, KS really technically allowed travel Topeka, KS St. Louis, MO, never really enforced all.

We one chance get right, window started February (not march 12th later lockdowns WFH started really ramping up) Seattle, NYC, cities first cases. late now. covid crisis highlighted what‘s ALWAYS been. honestly thought economic ’caste‘ system? anything employers might inclined let someone stay home, fear infecting others worksite.

He's one deserves it. obese old man alive There's still proof protests contributed spike.

Really sad read that. remains seen. disease spread America NYC suburban rural areas much lower concentration resources experience. rural area half-dozen critical patients, couple beds ventilators end 4 dying simply due lack resources. 

Now transfer around quickly, would help, America vast country. rural America, distance next available bed ventilator could pretty far. could overwhelmed. That's opened quickly Gavin without contact tracing, mask requirement (enforced) traveller quarantines. mean small suburban neighborhood. live NH small cul-de-sac .

Or, sorry, mean lockdown protestors refused wear masks? so, agree. Already rode one large hit brain. can’t perform surgery patients *because* Medicare Medicaid.

Agreed, people downplaying importance masks idiots. country enforcing measures prevent spread virus, masks brainer. Take mask sneeze them. Assert dominance. said see many contacts. deciding see think lifestyle risky. made conscious decision individual case, that's said ""You thinking seeing them"".

Hmm yes wonder study took account correlation vs. causation would think gets weekly transfusion antibodies.

Fuck dude. 
Let's go bowling. Yeah really cool idea said problem. sweating hair growing mom acting like get haircut soon might physically die. Grandmas haircuts man.  anti-intellectualism people told. so-called intellectuals fucked pooch hard. media told us masks work unless N95 mask protect you. Fauci told everyone wear masks (he claims afraid shortage). fact still paper surgical masks available live, everyone either made bought homemade cloth masks wearing bandannas face, train-robber style. exactly could done months ago effect supply masks, none. Look think start China. way got first explosion means almost definitely start there.

""but reservoir SARS-like viruses bats means originated China""

It’s spreading like crazy crowded indoor areas AC recycled air great spots virus spread. Well no, many 5Gs there, they? /s Vic Health Department pretty certain timings infections nothing Protests. Daniel Andrews, Premier Victoria, would loved reverse true could stop future protests. 

Anyway, get surge protests means got lucky. may mean catching infection open air hard do. People still quote Dr Fauci early March said non-sick people don’t need masks 60 Minutes. 

Advance now, logic says don’t know sick! people still insist “Dr. Fauci said....” 🙄 Personally, think lot entitlement narcissism comes pledge idea America best shoved throats birth. yell friend frlm Nevada City, far Tahoe, anti-mask campaign FB, May-ish.

Yoga-teaching, world-music dancing, real natural type. California full rebels, get caught harmful anti-whatever waves. one ridiculous Facebook post saying wearing mask leads wearing hijab. I'm joking Check theory: Masks don’t prevent transmission. virus transmitted wearing masks, it’s lower viral load, less deadly. infected lower viral load exhale lower amounts virus infected. becomes ‘herd’ situation population whole spreading lower amounts virus i.e. less severe cases infected. Higher percentages asymptomatic infection. theory masks structural impact course virus. always believed sympathized, get wont wear masks social distance. want both. problem truth actually clear. clear other, similar viruses, masks much unless sufficiently rated combined protocols gear.

It bit shock data started come showing SARS-Cov-2 significantly blocked even basic mask use. still entirely know case. *never* bad idea cautious. I'm sure stylist mind working outside either! many died? lmao sweden Damit that's gonna say! give touching face, heard one awhile stagnant deaths month 28k new cases on5/8 6/6. seen death pop pretty much seen 20k cases month half. look case verse death charts they've heading opposite directions month, long enough deaths Every time someone generation family gets case protesting BLM, believing science, always remind them, ""*You* person taught government overreach! *You* person taught government officials killing citizens without repercussions bad! *You* person told go experts listen media. can't possibly get case this,"" usually makes think bit.

My family made extremely intelligent people, always protection believing lie. someone pushes back way understand, tough reconsider position (having right much long). can, though. think many us recognize hypocrisies they're pointed us. I've heard ""Hey, know sheep wear right?"" ""Those anything muzzle you"".

The former replied ""nothing says sheep like ignoring advice people save lives every day."" No, lying. wish people would stop repeating this.

We learned lot virus transmits. Early on, thought fomite transmission primary source infections, airborne virus playing small role. scenario, masks really help. Additionally, treated like respiratory viruses spread primarily someone symptomatic. Finally, mask wearing early seen way protect wearer directly. However, surgical masks provide much protection, know properly wear mask cause harm good (from touching face adjust mask, giving false sense protection). Using information, really seem like masks important general public.

Now, though, understand fomite transmission small contributor, airborne main one. understand presymptomatic patients spread virus readily, meaning can't rely sending sick people home. Also, surgical masks meant protect wearer, great protecting everyone else. such, policy changed recognize mass mask wearing important.

Public health policy complex nuanced. legitimate reasons whole way certain advice given. Nobody lying. faced novel virus took time us learn it, learned, changed advice. India’s daily deaths caught USA. Check yesterday’s count. USA’s deaths record low since peak. I've seen all, literal holes punched masks people swapping masks one liked pattern (two girls). Wish kidding.. No, US countries, ""white people regimes"" overall... take great offense German lump us idiots. required people wear masks public early look numbers, beat east asian countries. Exactly! Wear mask, prevent germs spread! say jump this, appear cardiovascular impacts related covid-19 definitely need talked researched heavily (stuff like tachycardia blood clotting) cite bullshit think constitutional not. 1900 national guard enforced quarantine around SF Chinatown using barbed wire armed checkpoints.  Unless knows already got never reported on. born it. ingrained toxic culture, especially raised right wing environment I'm isolation barely go still would issues tracing steps past 2 weeks, understandable idiots really clue think Sweden thought they'd hit herd immunity something.  Owe company money? 

I would drop assholes heart beat. 

How fuck going owe Money supposed pay YOU. long follow important ones, good job decreasing risk transmission. Mainly social distancing (wear mask possible) washing hands. golden rule: isolate symptoms. many people ignore one. Governor Cuomo said NYC’s coronavirus strain came European travelers. NYC definitely European tourists Asian countries. Also, people Asian countries habit wearing masks daily basis regardless Covid habit handshake greetings. Yeah went 711 today, still required mask order, literally one except old man wearing masks, even fucking workers wearing masks. people think reason, like seriously, shouldve never let quarantine Ah yes justify lying. country told citizens masks werent effective. 

You cant believe anthony fauci’s lie *part reason* people skeptical anti mask? like pregnancy. testing. /S  Denmark never wore masks.... idea same, prevent germs spread covering mouth sneeze? white people must mean American white people, right?
Most Europeans problem wearing masks even mandating them. mena lied? except declare thing pandemic January itself, limited data zero knowledge extent it? scum ppl like rude, judgemental nerve call stupid clue I'm married black woman completely agree protesting racism..just PANDEMIC. Oh p.s wife thinks same, guess raciest right? summary, faster get starving person food, less likely die starvation. Mega brain shizzle. Depends entirely extent talking about. Unfortunately many ""laws"" created lockdowns states absolutely Constitutional, one main reasons people gave think aren’t dumb. learned something. Dumb people don’t listen, don’t learn. Good you. heard theory. Unfortunately, Texas flu season still winter. really dont understand happens, can't see covid following path. Science says masks retain moisture breeds infection. watched people? walk another person lower mask talk them. common sense Fauci lied efficacy. could’ve guessed? Italians Spaniards typically kiss one cheek great other. recall seeing news clip Milan early days outbreak people refused stop tradition. French sometimes kiss two cheeks although think less common one cheek kiss Italy Spain. Oddly I'm 3rd BR resident thread I'm really gutted we've blown it. governor something amazing implementing SAH etc quickly. great deal public willingness comply small obnoxious vocal minority going complain matter what. stayed SAH (it lax here) early June, would success story today instead waiting next FL TX. sucks. That’s said. said idea behind two fundamentally same. Prevent germs spread. crtl+y! crty+y! crtl+y! Divers across country pax. lockdowns constitutional sure best link top search. cause vaccines causing autism. /s  drives insane. ordered masks mandatory public redacted days later. Abbott, balls? We've using UV lights c-diff rooms ED awhile, adding COVID+ PUI rooms hard, takes time always room turnover. wassup kho Trump told Wall Street Journal that, ""Americans wearing masks signal disapproval him, protection."" responsible political now. Summer heat kills virus. need worry. like flu. live VA. Masks mandatory, numbers decent, we're twelve miles NC border.

This like watching formerly-agreeable neighbor descend mental health spiral worrying constantly he's gonna come onto property start destroying shit.  Europe's population 2.3 times x US. Since one stated obvious: deaths still low since three week lag diagnosis death rage, bc warranted.

The issue suddenly care suffering brown children, means reopening economy ASAP caution wind. give shit day, hell, PROMOTE IT.

Government:

""Oh, mean lot money stake? Okay, problem. Here's law.""
""The rest peons STFU continue risking lives bars, restaurants.""  argument clue talking about, start flinging childish insults. show 'em. sure that. Many exiting Tulsa rally seemed bored well totally oblivious protestors. bad way, way ""why even bother coming hear old whiny bullshit? f park, anyway?""

The individual cult member needs feel larger cult surrounding them. Kool Aid drinking, questions asked, usually happens height cult leaders powers persuasion. Trump's dwindling cause says exhausting shit again. numbers VISIBLY dwindling. shocking visual I'm sure supporters home. 

I say, though, bunching people together behind him? Worst fucking idea ever rallies. masks droplets tend fall towards floor - whomever ahead beneath you. bottom back row behind Trump, COVID hot zone. didn’t. downvote fairies hang /new. get immediately almost every comment make. Thanks, Lt. Gov. Patrick. do....... pissed today, Wayne County Sherriff getting food today neighboring county without mask. excuse, buddy? county one bad ones.

Trying process retardation comments brought pretty close it. eating healthy welfare? political systems, situation complicated look closely.

The US constitution reserves small set powers US Federal Government, assigns *all other* powers individual states. federal powers related trade commerce states -- example, federal government restrict movement states.

As (an American) understand it, legal ways US President federal government whole lock even require mask usage without consent individual state governors legislatures. *lot* ways coerce state governors consent, take time -- theory -- state government could still choose consent. states accepted cost noncompliance -- one famous examples US state Montana (sometimes) refusing set enforce federally-mandated driving speed limit, cost losing funding road maintenance.

The state governors, part, declare lockdowns public safety measures, even state governments limited options without explicit cooperation county governments. example, California's various measures completely ignored areas due county governments refusing enforce measures. like jumping cliff blaming shoes. Maybe realized two grams NSAID day makes fever go away. influenza virus tends mutate coronavirus, would wager chances needing number booster shots coronavirus low. 

However, still much know COVID-19, take grain salt. family member works Publix there. Luckily mandate masks employees customers. sent pictures today empty shelves across store, getting fewer fewer shipments food. Hurricane season going mess. surprise noone half brain Go bar y’all it. Ok? downvote me? Lol said MDW spike last week. People started parties again. Thats article says too. health issues become ""pre-existing condition"" prevent getting decent health insurance rest lives. Classic half full/half empty people allowed get tested. beginning pandemic way could get test admitted hospital. majority states zero criteria someone get tested, simple ask. people tested, mild cases, less deaths. Yeah even true kills COVID, kill whoever brings church!!!!! Lol time Kpop TikTOk armies assemble save stupid boomers themselves. world without rules world chaos. honestly think country accept unlimited amount people face issues what-so-ever? Kinda like what’s going Europe refugee crisis.  actually believed covid free, whatever reason.

For reason people still denial get angry others wearing masks. event patient COVID, would placed said doctors danger. Easier denial. 2-3 weeks July 4th gonna wild... 10% positives huge context. european countries overall % positives tests 5% 4-6%, US whole 8.2% increasing, meaning probably testing enough  No... red surge line. even close. Blue total ICU per ""JUST IT!"" I'm telling parents! Bravo. That's pretty bottom barrel passive aggressiveness, there.

I'm passive aggressive. I'm clearly stating unequivocally stand BLM protesters.

And I'm uninterested attributing COVID-19 cases them. cops stop brutalizing people would stop protesting. ominous trend considering mondays 'slow' day.

would accelerating outbreak push overdrive? Knowing her, I’m sure. issue article, never wanna miss chance rage. submission removed because

Fuck you. research like stories sailors USS Theodore needs taken seriously ppl start understand dire situation we're in. Optimism great makes ppl downplay info right front us help even ppl throw caution wind. please stop ways we're immune crap sailors, woman Dallas others stories keep thrown aside ppl wishing away. need stories front page maybe maybe ppl begin understand masks social distancing must maintained know more. Earth? technology, say, developed members church.



And billion dollars share masses! Herd immunity come baby Im Canadian cant really comment that, think country would much better broken distinct regions. technology, say, developed members church.



And billion dollars share masses! problem NYC major airports used hubs European international travelers. coming state side, chances connecting flight JFK, laguardia Newark flying states. It’s basically narrow part hour glass. Everything gets funneled right spreading across country. That's good thought. reason plasma distributed widely? dangerous unproven something?  go celebrate Six Flags reopened! Wow, Tennessee, paid $20,000.00 cancer surgery student insurance paid 80%. Except, I'm student, $20,000.00 Except one really work. I've saying since day one, we're probably going end among last developed countries dealing shit rest world gets shit together. 

We look like goddamn idiots. fuck ""Goober Cooper""? still wait line. actual time take test 5min, 30min waiting car. Depends go course. depends encounters occurred long, according best science matter. pretty well accepted indoors group people best way get it, eventually, depending else building it. single person it, others start getting it, depending interacts ventilation, AC, etc. 

If brief encounters indoors out, isnt unusual stay uninfected even thousand encounters. But, said, guarantees, dont push luck. one coughs right face, youre likely trouble. turns out, putting hands ears shouting ""la-la-la"" effective method stop spreading highly contagious virus. obviously “long term studies” virus barely 6 mos old experience past GGO lead fibrosis, clinically relevant decline lung function.  Would like papers detailing clinical correlates GGO fibrosis (most likely) wasting time virus reservoir horseshoe bats China originated there.

France also found cases back December connected people coming Wuhan relatives did. pretty consistent current timeline virus emerged humans late November Meat substitutes also kinds additives unknown consequence, artificial flavorings colors, cannot have. serms like meat bad, food general kinds stuff bad you. Food prices general increased 4.1 percent April 2019 April 2020. Every thing need buy expensive, nutritional supplements must take. 
There European countries buy meats. opinion reason cancer rates high U. S.is bad food. many artificial ingredients artificial colors. Insane. northern PHX got tested drive Mayo clinic less 15 min, results next morning. people getting tested sort public health means? Completely unfair, shows huge inequality someone insurance pay testing cant. need medicare equitable health care all! CDC going update recommendation soon. Dr. Fauci record 3 min video indicating initial advice masks deliberate lie. also indicated masks work directions, protect others wearer, protect wearer others.  So, CDC's current advice sync Fauci said interview.     Looks like saying ordered least tried also looks like Trump administration withholding $25 billion supposed used bolster testing efforts. know you, looks lot like administration President abdicating responsibility putting people danger advocating testing, also actively taking measures increase testing capacity.

I think fits definition ""sarcastic"". mean think chance unlikely. point maybe become reinfected several months maybe would worse Dayum, meet ass got handed you... above? can’t argue stupid.... Let's hope recirculated air goes straight oval office....  March 1 median age positive test 65.

Now median age 37.

More people Florida age 90 died people age 65 covid-19.

Source: lot adults young people about. They're disproportionately getting infected.

But take month deaths follow admissions hospital. news, sky blue. even news? air system works power prayer. Joe Biden democratic candidate. Wish requirement Denmark best friend tested positive two weeks ago one contacted him. Asian countries **regard elders keepers knowledge, experience tradition**. **Disobeying order elder like assaulting police officer, it**. **It's norms, places like South Korea** able avoid economic shutdown without significant increase infected patients.

Um.... really. society culture, extent, perpetuate respecting elders comes actual policies national mobilizations, nothing it.

Koreans coronavirus control **because safety logic**. gov immediately enacted laws backed science common sense, people stupidly deny like Americans do. completely direct, though, right? IIRC windows block UV light, good stuff. proven many Gov organization (including own). don’t even understand need prove you. still wear masks (oh guys decided needed), hang fine Saturday night watch SOCCER bar hope safe environment. least Japanese afraid wear masks. there's Australia. Never required masks one lowest deaths per capita. give enough time vet doctors grope women id say huh? Pssst, im America sadly, idea do.... every state themselves. I'm actually kinda bored so: 

[here 
[are  time valued science collectively counter masks wonders, countries require mask showed much coordinated swift response countries don't.

Look country masks mandatory, cases imported quarantined spot, free roaming covid yet, still required wear masks case case passes screening undetected. Doug too? know Doug. Still defending sacrificing doctors nurses, brave! worst part though affects us couple questions Pakistani firends-
1. govt get away spending almost 1/6th budget army use close non essential services like religious places.
2. china giving ventilators like US giving India ventilators miss something? easiest answer “because he’s stupid”.

Which corroborated endless evidence. Anyone know rumor hoax founded? live Kansas City. far largest population general non mask wearing white. Practicality Latinos are, however hardest hit yet smallest community. Jackson County (KC) 23 deaths, Wyandotte County (latino community KC) 78 deaths. There's rhyme reason much this. course are. Millions dead reported noticed... /s also head epidemiologist said masks unnecessary stupid think virus would discriminate places first place obvious statement ever mean evidence except trumps literal words? said loud, camera, press conferences front Americans world: “Dr Fauci may agree but..”

That real. evidence. real conflict two, wasn’t even one time thing. isn’t even debatable, happened front world camera. I'm rereading too. I'm rereading another post-apocalyptic series includes global warming, hyper-inflation, recession, terrifying demagogue runs president wins appealing extremist right wing slogan ""make America great again"". Earthseed series Octavia Butler written nineties. Even first read 10 years ago thought scarily prescient,  feels like news article fiction. I’m loss well.  feel retarded? could see merit churches, provide people social spiritual aspect, needs enforce health codes orders sent down. churches virtual services, think stick time.

Strip clubs? thats industry that’s going disappear. u/burnerbang PCR positive rate gone 5% 17% month. aren’t slowing spread. 

And think Ducey making decisions considering actual data, bridge sale. 

Stop /r/coronavirusaz want real data. people need phones stay inside time? want call people way staying contact. Accounting demand must phones think safe say fact 120 million people probably died. (Watch actually published someone) front-page Reddit analogy bit ago, drawn MS Paint two stick figures various stages pissing other. Hello Netherlands! 😱 another fun conspiracy  Oh wow know that, public transport since February Unfortunately could everything right still get due someone else’s negligence :( sad think way, painfully true. It’s pretty simple, don’t tell people “masks don’t work” right bat, ever, still people insisting don’t need wear masks. they’re worried supply medical professionals could told everyone cover nose mouth scarves go out. grew hearing 9/11 taught generation bad things fact happen soil. Evidently, arrogance seeped back culture became complacent again. Yes totally agree masks help lot. cannot get severe Japan hit this. Japanese wear masks almost time even this. run red light get call illegal rest life? one reached anywhere close herd immunity actual opinion? never plan Sweden. agree lot things wrong here, basically general consensus virus gonna around long time (effective safe vaccines often takes years develop), put country complete lockdown? 

Did Sweden fuck entirely? Maybe, it’s still early really say. Many Scientists still believe second, worse, wave many countries lifted lockdowns. Hopefully won’t happen - hope Sweden curve stay flat healthcare system handle it. Yaaa met average person? 2 bullet points people would still fuck up, let alone 6. requiring masks still slows spread even people wrong. dont exactly right. going see next NY like events next set large cities. It’s already underway. Dumb people everywhere italian living Spain, insulting get put USA regimes. Like ""beating arresting"" wearing mask regime, like China biggest regime.  go wherever money is.  30k cases low twenties last week? Hoping get funding research paper, ""Hitting Hand Hammer Causes Hand Hurt"". 🤞 sounds like you’ve never actually worn one before. ""stop"" people's spit, spit sitting face. breathe in, mask N95 can't actually filter virus particles.

When mask stops spit, keeps spit sitting face instead people's faces. surge expected since we’ve started opening again, think we’re overly cautious progress different phases. It’s difficult impatient annoyed slow we’re moving since we’ve lockdown phases since early March, think we’re right looking states. 1918 flu killed 675,000 Americans. ""That's equivalent 225 450 million people today

Horseshit - 450 million entire US population currently. killing 225 million people would still Americans dying this, that's twice high % even CAUGHT spanish flu (28% Americans).

I'm calling wrong terms foolishness rally people foolish Spanish Flu, one quote really fucks numbers. That's pay doctors do. What? No. Fuck humility. plain day masks worked, even doubt, plain day hurt. CDC narrative masks used general population something never accept. Wow sky blue...

Do really needed study something obvious? I’m saying fully trust even China outbreak started almost woods. friend works global manufacturing works factories Wuhan says it’s much control. used full weight authoritarian regime force people quarantine, mandatory tracing apps, etc. It’s lot harder implement free society kinda worked. information though wholly anectodtle. must say, trump even allowing that. guy hijacking state supplies keeping federal government. political. made statement that's objectively false I'm correcting you. said BLM contributed spike. zero evidence far BLM protests causing increase COVID cases region United States. least gets cooked? sigh. Kiwi here, confirm, masks anywhere seen. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yea remember people panic bought toilet paper? Would exact thing masks Fauci lied; people died. Fauci said masks nothing months. blame though. speculate entire administration kept saying that...especially Fauci, smart experienced...because PPE shortage. Medical personnel enough mask. Imagine told everyone needs wear mask! would Toilet Paper 3.0. People needed wouldnt gotten actually got. People literally donated extra PPE hospitals. wouldnt done government told mask required.

As much dont like administration, one thing tried right. Panic masks last thing wanted pandemic.

People common sense kept wearing mask. ones without common sense...I feel sorry them. manufacturer high-energy oxygen ions help cluster particulates together. clustering effect allows existing air filter capture microscopic particles would normally pass through.  charged ions interact tiny airborne pollutants, oxidizing drop breathing zone.  homes see 90% reduction particulates contaminants within 4 hours, 99.8% reduction 6 hours less. 

Even claims true, system would helpful kill virus present event started. There's nothing suggest would impact thousands people packed together.

And church even need say this? believe Covid-19 real, either go wear mask try keep distance others. believe another flu (like assume attendees do), worried first place. confirm Thailand South Korea (two countries attract amount Chinese tourists) close borders exponential growth (at least Jan early Feb). Taiwan hates China closed borders also exponential growth. think CCP wants link COVID military games 100 countries attended could brought Wuhan countries. reeks self-righteousness thread. Granted, Reddit. Finally saw people wearing masks today (I live Florida, already reopened cause things fine!) least 30% noses. put mine make sure pinch tightly around nose make airtight seal fucks exhaling outside masks sheer ignorance. Ugh. MONTHS since started recommending face masks trump STILL isn’t wearing mask isn’t making people wear rallies Hilariously released video showing people make mask tee shirt river bands April assumed flu, testing covid then. COD ""pneumonia"" ""MI"", people 30s 40s catastrophic heart attacks without usual comorbidities.

Which hospital logs referring to? truth come soon. fudging numbers run limit, hide excess death, massive numbers. fair U.S.A everyone watched reddit mainly uS based. also seems major problem well. 🤷‍♂️ Yeah, kind smoking crack compared everyone else. Jerome Adams unqualified embarrassment. got job played Trump’s ridiculous game.

The real reason got job Pence's Indiana State Health Commissioner. held position Indiana's HIV outbreak (gasp... sounds familiar...) oppose needle exchange programs despite evidence they're effective. made outbreak worse changed mind. America great generations ago. Now, America like rich kid flaunts inherited wealth thinks earned it. Reason #44 I'm moving another country over.  North Korea 😂  directly, people see others protesting, keeping social distancing repurcussions think, “why hell social distance don’t.”
  Creates illusion safe congregate Cloth masks absorb moisture unusable short time. What's worse Brazil large population bats corona viruses. blame trump everything. Dr fauci person professional opinion. 

And lied. 

Its joke try drag trump *pressured* Fauci lie. absolutely evidence it. Yay area yet California seen biggest jump cases. Denmark didn’t recommend masks amazing. 

A serious, quick acting lockdown travel ban needed. yeah fuck need masks. 

Early though? didn’t need masks, needed gov act. Really opprression ? come see fight Covid. Well maybe still better Land Freedom guess, sorry prefer died old age instead covid Well city- county-wide mandates... mayor said CNN today mask enforcement event. Makes perfect sense. Edit: Oops. way! brilliant. oh 3 months shutdown in-between :-( high school band director Texas, I'm terrified expected start month marching band cases growing. We've watched kids choose social distance. research coming Covid causes permanent lung damage...something could end young musician's career. Yet, unilaterally decide cancel marching band I'll run town. school strength conditioning camp lasted week student tested positive got shut down.

I wish would sort LEADERSHIP state, either governor TEA UIL single school district, would stand say none activities (football included) worth it. Well, well 2 million cases, 1 million recovered pretty bad news. big deal Trump holds rally indoors everyone saying week two ago people beaches going spread virus mention protests included thousands people? 

We go airports still shop stores likely don’t disinfect products sold? also said wearing mask could *increase* person's risk catching virus. [March 2nd, Korea advanced tracking app records places basically bars entry places cases, get tested. Edit: incorrect, advanced tracking capabilities. Dude, constitution full kinds bullshit, one knows what's it. Lol can’t argue 😭 mean say part world, USA? don’t mind asking?

I’m Georgia barely quarantine cases city live in. feels like nothing even happened here. priest slapping child priest slam dunking child holy water? Happy Cake Day! thought they’d accesible everyone now. There’s hotel throws pool parties NY open pool parties. test everyone COVID SITE enter. also require insurance card active. business get COVID testing kits Arizona? fairness US (which don’t normally do) mass grave believe you’re talking one prison?

That grave site actually prison disposed bodies ever since prison opened. obviously lot bodies due covid, it’s reach say mass grave covid. opinion media reaching pretty far headline one.

Not say won’t nice body pits coming Florida soon... Yeah. Sorry burst bubble Americans done covid. Don’t care anymore willfully partially participate mask wearing social distancing long (D)politicians/mainstream media enforce it. millions Americans believe election full scale opening happen nobody risk people give two shits Covid. Oh always case finally pick one dozens cures actually let people take them. remember wearing type mask helps - actually concentrate breath make worse around (due valve opens breathe out) argued may issue correlation vs cause -- deny masks likely help stop spread cause coronavirus, noted country requires masks earlier also going implementing many stringent health measures vs. countries don't.

The point I'm trying make issue simple 'masks help coronavirus'. feel invalidates everything else countries deaths done correctly push narrative around one specific talking point. bad alpharetta, ga. Everyone trumper masks.....just let spread bad....says 60 year old issues....like wtf. get starting economy without proper benefits common folk fuck Damn. Nothing see here, folks. pay attention positive Amazon PR commercials TV. white people still studying shit. don’t understand needs ‘study’ tbh. It’s common sense, blows mind people can’t grasp mask lower risk contagious respiratory illness.

Wear damn mask! we're seeing patient complaints Tr*mp said x can't must libs minority doctors must racist treating white people.

Well, they're actually wrong Right .. overflow going Houston. Beaumont full hospitals surrounding areas closed. Orange 77,000 thousand people now, zero hospitals. Port Arthur closed one last year. hospitals area stretched thin virus. Lots uninsured area too. unfortunately, don’t believe wearing masks. Houston expect wave. I'm curious Lol that’s exponential growth works...unless get R0 value 1, it’ll grow. got tired main account sides assuming i'm american, partisan american politics. attacking instaed adressing arguments.

I mostly post stuff comment time time account. post sub since clo-junkie era. frustrates much, training simple. simple put bullet points. know what, I'm gonna copy/paste below. Hopefully everyone knows case!

* Wash hands handling mask
* touch mask hands unless putting removing it
* Keep nose &amp; mouth matter (even talking)
* eat drink situation need mask
* Wash, dispose of, quarantine three days mask done wearing it
* Keep mask talking, coughing, sneezing. remove done wearing expect. policy 'fuck you, wear mask'. AU NZ top 10; intents purposes, seen effective since can't 1 1 comparisons due different circumstances.

Top 10 1 middle Eastern country, 3 European, 3 Asian, 2 Anglosphere (NZ AU). elite tier frankly, whether #1 #10 makes difference. Effective effective. I'm sure plasma ice. failed elder brother. culture elder siblings next parents. 

And proceed post Vox article.

L L Fuck Trump (what NSA?) 

What failure pro trick: use painters tape horizontally achieve nice flat edge Maybe part world (Asia Pacific). mine almost everywhere quarantine almost virus. That’s going change anytime soon. admit underestimated stupidity Americans. dumb thought were, turns even dumber. Abbot increasingly taking “disappointed parent” tone us tbh fuck off. Yeah, also... suggestions work. time, good idea abstain alcohol immune health immunity everyone talking positive cases like it’s end world? matters death rate hospitals. That’s locked down.

We know risk know viruses tend get less lethal mutate pose less risk. can’t live life fear hope vaccine might take year, two, never come That's probably best way deal it. downplay seriousness covid like bad bad flu people arent gonna concerned get it. People recovering record numbers isnt bad. amount deaths like less normal daily death rate influenza B combined let's rational. Well first surge infections (in us) testing incredibly lacking. despite active hospitalizations going places, daily cases increased increased testing capacity, comparisons little skewed.

I think you’re right though. Combined new standards care reduces mortality fact mostly young people going getting infected, wave deaths definitely much smaller comparison. Also consider large portion deaths places health care system strained, particularly NYC. always drives death rate. going go away like miracle friend died flu November, young mother lot hospitals thoracic occlet syndrome. keep thinking something going come one hospitals never does, think actually Flu. really miss smile kind words wish happened family. Raw dogging porn actresses totally something germaphobes do... Correlation causation. 

It's likely country requires masks quicker top many facets compared country would take longer. couple strong sneezes coughs crowd may exactly that. entire fucking state Georgia wearing masks - fucked spread. hope continually mutate lesser strain. heard maybe ozone generation? pretty easy find cheap ozone generators, they're usually good killing biological things. that's case, though, definitely want running there's crowd people present. Thoughts? prayers? shit Gov. Abbott, gonna stick plan time going fold ""little lady"" hair dresser puts  peoples life danger repercussions buck. China -high mask wearing, high covid deaths.
Australia/nz, low mask wearing, low covid deaths.

Headline seems shit?

Masks obviously help extent though. I'm fast cook, guess. honest said shortage people general public want wear masks, help prevent transmission virus, could make cloth one themself explain this.

That's Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia Slovenia did. Slovenia became first Europe end epidemic. Unless tourists visiting boring ass 9-5 job across globe....

&amp;#x200B;

xd Wow! wow! special place hell two. real scientists would figured beginning pandemic. Secondly, even work says ""kills COVID"" air ten minutes. people sitting close proximity ten minutes virus could infect 100-200 people. probably spread 100-200 others on. virus inhaled system useless. course they're selling fiction though. think lot factors play it. think we're lied to? Yes, least manipulation statistics play, seen Abbott picking numbers missing data, Houston lagging lately. also spread out, lot slower spread say New York think main reason seeing body bags tossed back semis. Due that, seeing drawn peak. worries most, south peaking whereas New England west coast seen peaks declining. means we've longer learn virus implement effective treatments come versus say March-April. Texas going whole world hurt month. Hospitals already hurting, going get worse. look Abbott, look reporting, gives number hospital capacity looks good compared total capacity, number completely missing Houston. That's cherry picking. That's what's happening. best sounding numbers thrown out. seen episode Daily Show Trevor Noah. compares Trump Idi Amin. speech Trump saying exact thing. hilarious 😆 Guess what, woman use trimmer, too!

How come that? still people family mad didn't, still stand fact we'd better without Edwards 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 rational post, surprised see quickly downvoted. saying agree undeniable fact protests opening businesses, ""defying mask requirements"" say? quickly we've forgotten ""I need haircut"" meme lady? Pretty sure rabid chihuahua bender could done better job... correct. March 10, fda.gov read “The CDC recommend people well wear face mask protect respiratory diseases, including coronavirus”. Plus there's tens thousands roads cross state borders. impossible enforce Abbott: please wear masks

Texas: no

Abbott: okay. please increase efforts bury death tolls “pneumonia”?

Texas: roger They're rotting fields due lack That’s misleading. cannot ignore that

1) COVID hospitalizations increasing Arizona

2) large portion ICU beds filled covid patients

3) daily hospitalizations cases trending upwards. Considering little 20% Arizona’s ICU beds empty that’s alarming. House? sunbathe little VitD?? learned nothing stops Americans proudly wrong.

80% high end “normal” probably gets bad flu seasons. Whats especially concerning hospitalizations cases trending upward, flat. They’re going up. 80% capacity, mind good all. Taken seriously? joke? one highest death rates world? letting people country freely months without quarantine testing, every country around us locked strategy nothing let rip population herd immunity, decided abandon idea modellers predicted would mean 500,000 people could die. government everything could delay locking cost lot lives. sent covid positive paitents carehomes without testing starting another set outbreaks there. still people dying country Europe 2x many people testing positive daily.

I would guess San Diego situation lazy look up. still think RIVM government saying masks effective avoid people mass hoarding them, whilst people needed none.

So believe government told everyone masks useless provoke people bought box donate local hospital. bigger stock hospitals safe number, spreading actual truth masks.  . Everyone knows can't catch corona protesting guess never sneezed wearing mask since time house limited I'm guessing mask keeps pollen dust stuff outta sinuses anyway. 

That said, one wet sneeze I'm effectively going waterboard myself. better keep spare handy. ego Sweden.

When I'm running, mask gets drenched sweat, basically good protecting others, case started symptoms yet. (And, see people without masks, think, ""If get sick, assholes like you."") touch mask hands unless putting removing it

Common sense says chances infection virus material outside mask close zero.

* virus cannot multiply outside host (unlike bacteria);
* Viruses desintegrate surfaces;
* time touch mask, amount virus dilutes exponentially (for instance halves touching masm half virus fingers half stays behind mask);
* time virusses move one surface another, become exponentially less infectious part inevitably gets destroyed;
* viral load virus surface likely low pass infection first place unless extreme circumstances like someone putting microphone mouth used infected person. virus would spread easily surfaces, virus would spread much faster;

The over-the-top face mask handling guidelines seem general guidelines use hospital setting bacteria great concern. convinced mass-wearing face masks public places sufficient stop spread, regardless face mask handled. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Congrats making assumptions symptoms tested? literally understand universal masking thing beginning entire shit freaking February. They're like 1/3 way herd immunity now, would extremely weird infection rates stayed high wet-cleaning compromise mask's filtering properties. agree part, it’s really ‘Masks block it. Period.’ type scenario. Studies done currently effectiveness masks lowering transmission rates. Believe not, really know things sometimes. shit. rhetorical question. finally get rid Gone Wind Aunt Jemima syrup though. complete loss. James Trickington, got one sucker internet.. haha! person thread claimed doctor tore pieces. Said effective public taking one away doctor.

This another issue person people authority lying. lie get people faster without scepticism. might take upon spread further. Sometimes could lead getting arguments strangers think good thing. 

Lying whatever reason public officials crime thrown jail.  March. wear mask stores want normative. think might reduce anxiety elderly shoppers. 

In unmasked places, care all. could get twice, I'd already gotten twice. bars opened it. Ok one good. I'm stealing it. shown effective severe cases, gladly take side effects means dying shows misunderstanding purpose study statistical analysis general. Statistical analysis ability establish causation, paper fail that’s purpose. Correlation random, quite rare examples. statistical analysis actually simply find link two variables determine strong enough accept relationship (p value). study shows strongest indicators low mortality previous traditions mask wearing early requirements wear them.

Determining causation case would incredibly difficult, would likely need get group people live completely isolated several weeks intentionally infect covid simulate spread. Remember back said, ""next week generation's Pearl Harbor""? kind big deal. two months later gave up. started, repeatedly said evidence masks effective. honest, think case need much science say something takes little bit common sense.  Common sense tells half idiot masks helpful stop spreading illness would doctors, nurses etc wear around patients? Neither significant levels community transmission. second shut international travel new cases absolutely plummeted. Average Australians New Zealanders never high odds catching virus - masks irrelevant. know better. right CDC wrong. pretty much expected full lifting advisories.

Way many infections coming red-light districts, particularly venues catering women, moment though. want 2020’s wild ride dumbass hid inside thinking catch corona point. lockdown long hard want. second take foot brake, epidemic resumes. way past it. encourage people wear bandannas homemade mask? absolutely know speaking. lockdown place areas India. Migrants mostly back hometowns. crisis mostly solved. Well really minority. biggest problem two largest parties country kind hopeless. happens every election people go choose best worst. lockdown long hard want. second take foot brake, epidemic resumes. way past it. opposite true China. earliest days pandemic, youngest generations acted fastest desperately tried get relatives wear masks. oldest generations refused wear one ""not big deal"" ""we went SARS fine without masks"".

No wonder American idiots get infected droves.  could prevent others endangering respiratory systems, Sure, let's discuss nothing enlightening two people per day. shit Well scare people staying home unless circumstances unavoidable.

That's people beaten (even bad idea raise awareness), let everyone know matter serious. New Zealand shut like 2 cases. could walked around licking door handles mattered.

It's absolutely clear day masks effective need amongst people area community transmission. Advice changed. science now. experts agree. Correct fitting masks right caliber prevent COVID particles entering respiratory system, also leaving going airborne. must soooooo hard studies.

 ""studies show man can't breathe moon."" holyshit way. ""billionaires money most"" wow must hard study. Jesus christ. take 5 mins figure one A. never vaccine. 

B. Whatever vaccine produced may provide partial protection, last limited time. 

C. vaccine renders epidemic irrelevant coming 2021.

Choose one like. one crystal ball, everyone speculating. know things governments common required masks? Leaders taking virus seriously.

Nope. Plenty countries took seriously require masks (Sweden) plenty countries require masks take serious (China). 

I know I'm probably arguing teenager still rebel phase thinking know everything better, parent comment right wrong. complex all, science works. never said agree masks, said place biggest circlejerk universe That's typical massive hypocrite Trump.

Literally every country East Asia done it, hell wear masks isn’t pandemic someone works job face close proximity someone else’s. It’s basic hygiene. I’m flabbergasted still debate requires intensive study. something think about... obtained latest data Statistics Sweden shows ""all cause"" mortality per day January 1 June 18, compared numbers latest COVID-19 data FHM.

As recently June 4, 20% people died single day reported COVID-19 death. highest percentage 29.41% April 8, average March 11, first death occurred, June 17 17.1%.

So noise heard video 5G tower watched 24/7? Makes frustrating wear mask tell everyone listen experts.  understand people utilize KN95 masks often United States. Please spread information friends family, especially vulnerable. (media seem know care):

It's really prohibitively expensive obtain proper KN95 masks, companies (Amazon, Costco, anyone really) could *easily* afford protect employees *effective* face coverings (especially bulk pricing, especially times 'hazard pay') daily basis. 

It's relatively easy find devices (besides 3M) approved non-NIOSH alternative respirators FDA's [emergency use I'll give example; quite possible approved devices available cheaper, can't bothered cross-check EUA list online retailers. Also beware counterfeits non-approved devices (some provide little protection).

Anyway masks passed CDC's [International Assessment Results – NIOSH-approved test flying colors. 10 pack $25 directly (purported) eBay store. I'll link it, r/hailcorporate, read far still can't find proper place, I'm sorry (will dm extra lazy).

If demand created 'approved' respirators, price would hopefully fall. Also, better legitimate brands there, I'd happy know. $25/10pc shipped sounded reasonable me. That's 10 times interact public feel reasonably safe!

Say U.S. stockpiled approved devices (assuming supply), contracted 'approved' facilities China March (well past peak pandemic there, U.S. admitted severe shortage NIOSH-approved devices February) supply country adequate number KN95 respirators 'at risk' individuals. crazy idea idea March, seems fallen deaf ears. Prices would plummeted now, supply would little concern, we'd well side 'curve.' Oh well, U.S. doomed behind curve face coverings (this case, would competent federal leadership).

**Tl;dr: **For less price coffee ($2.50/piece), every U.S. citizen could protect new, legitimate, KN95 face mask *daily.* country would probably (have) crush(ed) coronavirus transmission rates KN95 use commonplace, East Asia.

Good luck USA! That’s Vietnam little case, exactly point? course can’t SPOT diference, i? point wearing mask leads less case, Vietnam started using face masks since pandemic Please try argue good faith without using logical fallacies like strawmans appeals emotions. clearly meant.

In case really missed point - much better get sick first place. million survivors means hundred thousand fifty thousand died. Would rather survive plane crash 10% passengers dying competent pilots land plane instead? 

Its catastrophy, I'm glad survivors families celebrating like kind victory misguided. That's me. Sometimes brain ""normal mode"" even I'm wearing mask. seeing someone else ones brings back bit . Found 12 year old. Shoo, adults talking can't know. enough people tested say. Yep dumb question. realistic realize scenarios one give u firm answer....maybe, maybe not. frustrations feel perfectly valid....the fact matter much one tries abide sanitary conditions implement careful attempt, humanly possible ....it's virus abide process. Keeping mind that, attack surface instant time contagion spreads - still discovering new traits unfamiliar pandemic....and events handling scenario maybe one might accounted for, caused infection....that nothing actually clear-cut even health care practitioners techs, prepare sterile I.V. formulations injections administered patient 5th floor. There's set standards guidelines hospitals set, example, minimize error. process never fully perfect, anything could gone wrong mishandled first steps formulated downstairs, way final moments made way 5th floor injected nurse, etc.

I believe much backlash willingness (or lack thereof) embrace masks general public correllates frustrations realizations little control we, humans, are, viral pathogen. sucks, that's jusf certain things. rThe public ask questions doctors experts, 7 months, expect answer change refuse acknowledge data/recommendations...because well, know data/recommendations. May never clear-cut scenario....so maybe, maynbe night....no matter much try. Twitter, Jerome Adams said went get elective surgery (!!) hospital. insane. like corona-central hospitals. wearer spread shit talking coughing wich means even wear nose probably still job know , CDC never issued guidelines wear masks properly. What, no? basically copy paste comment, see point answering twice. entire logic ""i think like that's way must be"" anyway CDC said this?

Look India power parity u see outrageously cheap stuff medical professionals able use United States they're N95? I've seen KN95 sources, assumed local hospitals using cloth masks, they'd jump heartbeat. 

I'd interested using least getting area starts substantial percentages population coming it. I'm still mindset want take medical professionals stick thick layered cloth masks meantime. find one: ithe description rather vague. He's stubborn. hates admit administration wrong. *snip*

""Oh hey, side shorter. Better trim bit more"" Wow cool open nose mouth That's rather rude generalization. majority Americans decent people. wish did. many idiots Canada nit wearing anything. Grocery store employees walking around PPE... Yes, obviously would wash hands tandem wearing mask provide better coverage.

But that's argument here, agree danger surface transmission ranking higher direct transmission. (I clue mean aerosol transmission weak)

Yes people obsess mask wearing, good reasons main concern. mean forget hand sanitizing, mask remain main concern. Fucking WAL-MART better job screening people white house.... forget video game, knowledge incomplete given time. also direct correlation increase tests available, infections reported. tests, cases, problem! also made religious appeals people capacity job. Unfortunately true statement, albeit highly misleading one. Wearing simple cloth surgical mask protest wearer disease, protect everyone else. 

When everyone wears simple mask, everyone protecting everyone else. FU Dutch inadequacy criminal negligence! 

The asshiles still require masks. could joke, people weren’t dying. Texans must value “rights” neighbors. Spread seems lower states protests. Generally. Even state VA R .76 going down. Hello Sweden. masks sight, except hospitals occasional Asians. go straight Boulder? understand anyone sub. states opened 6 weeks ago spikes happening last week 2. Yet opening ""early"" blamed protests. don’t care government told you, every intelligent person knew including wearing mask get go.

I get it, you’re upset dumb animal, incapable reading lines. looked recently discussion movie theaters, seems airflow. study, tables nearest infected person directly front air blowing outwards AC infected. rest tables restaurant not. Hurricane season tho (always fear every living near shore here) It’s protests causing rise. go straight Boulder?  mean, didn’t really go whole scientific study double check, looked fact I’m Chinese, Asian countries wouldn’t *all* morons culture surrounding mask-wearing...

I've never episode bad one now. might infected march (very, mild), eczema started shortly after. much stress, can't issue. tough guy open nose mouth! Okay, posted baffled claims. However, majority Indians riding bandwagon created, bit agitated.

I want discuss moral behind this. claims come false (which will), repercussions claims? prosecuted based false advertisement? regarding pandemic cure? Wearing mask slightly painful, I'm sure less painful losing loved one. It’s like travel county banned. spread around state. neighboring states. Wow almost masks actually effective Finland, 7 144 confirmed cases, 327 confirmed deaths, required use masks. 

Norway, 8 751 confirmed cases, 248 confirmed deaths, required use masks.

Sweden, 58 932 confirmed cases, 5 122 confirmed deaths, required use masks.

Why Finland government required masks there's [little benefit widespread mask someone wants use mask, problem. illegal judge see someone using. IMO could give protected feeling wearer, wearing mask exposure covid virus.

They key act keep distances. Self quarantee. Lock rest homes relatives bring covid virus visiting. Close bars restaurants. That's did. (Finland) removed restrictions confirmed cases last 7 days 39.

Sweden bigger restrictions like Nordic countries result. mean, much good would really do? Protests mostly anonymous crowd, unless went friends able name anyone.  Also, recommended store something like single use paper bag, tupperwear always tell side touched part container. news headline starts Florida Man never ends ""does something rational"" Hopefully Kidurong cluster dies soon. lockdown right hope best! getting obvious lot foreigners know anything Malaysia skeptical numbers. suggest cry it.

*slowclap* written lawyer? time last year would blamed brexit. antibodies, lot cases, turns problem:

A separate study team Tsinghua University Beijing suggested antibodies produced Covid-19 patients, worse outcome – ***the patient strongest antibody response study died***.

They pointed ***a phenomenon known antibody-dependent enhancement, viruses “hitch ride” antibody infect cells could enter otherwise.***

(Dr. Wang Xinhuan) said “a big concern closely monitored”. Probably mask? Similar Denmark, today 37 hospitalized people. 2 Deaths since yesterday though. overshadowed there's way less spots lol.

Unlike toilet paper, make re-usable masks old clothing. auto moderator needs cool it. saying countering guy's ridiculous statement virus spreading exponentially everywhere NY. countered data proving lost started name calling. 

The negative culture sub sometimes completely disregard data lineup narrative. wonder outcome may be. $8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! happens scientists try politics politicians fuck take responsibility. title “Florida man” always delivers. really get rhe mask obsession equally important countermeasures Yeah, wearing something front eyes (be prescription glasses, sunglasses, safety goggles, face shield) probably easiest way protect *yourself* N95 similar masks widely available. told medical professionals life act masks offer us much protection adjust behaviour accordingly.

It surgical mask cannot form airtight seal around face (unless tape gaps face mask) unlike N95 mask *worn properly*. However, surgical mask still reduce amount droplets breath especially tighten elastic bands minimise gaps, could make difference also take precautions social distancing avoid staying indoor long.

The advice ""wearing mask sick"" becomes tricky even harmful comes COVID transmission, since pre-symptomatic patients spread virus well, help typical incubation period one week, means lot people infected patient realise he/she sick. also explains widespread use facemask, regardless people sick not, cut number infections drastically, chance virus spread even person pre-symptomatic. know. care argue either. exact date ship board?  So, warning virus behave else. Yeah, work. must spread easily way, otherwise would gotten it. county NJ cases many entire states well entire countries. yet NJ neck neck NY recovering worst numbers.

Having said that... 100% right, look. server food runner many moons ago. made learn cook dishes otherwise have, I'll say much. case restaurants, expect serious increase prices then. patronizing posts see Canadians toward Americans days, feel like say expect better Canadians. really I'm delusional realize racism much thing Canada too, perhaps hidden little better.  many people work wear nose it’s infuriating, even bother. That's always worry am. I'm Shenzhen covid free months get grocery deliveries everyday, sometimes multiple times day, guys busy maybe visit 20 homes hour. must admit long we've let guard little, outbreak Beijing reminder still need careful try disinfect everything gets delivered. live streamer Texas watch streaming drag racing tracks next one ever wearing mask social distancing way. watch hours spot maybe one two people wearing mask. surprise spreading like wildfire. you, sort evil wizard? Shouldn’t something already known though?? Based past outbreak instances countries, CDC already enough evidence information know precautions need put place slow spread flu-like virus, similar ones it. evidence data came light different compared information learned past outbreaks? stupid, lying ""the greater good"" aka masks medical personnel. 

If know better I'd say decision made politics mind, science. Man, guys rediculous. fking wonder. 

What mean guys? know nothing me. wonder what? assume believe I’m American something thus it’s gone shit. 


Like said, good social distancing covers lot think. Someone might sneeze unless you’ve got seriously windy conditions that’s unlikely either travel meter fly upwards face. 

Masks great people lazy dumb. everyone sneeze/cough elbow tissue, everyone stick social distancing, everyone wash hands before/after certain things.


I work college we’ve started assessments. don’t wear masks clean everything down, stick distancing gloves provided students use want. Hmmmmm. 3 month old account posts related coronavirus downplaying severity making extraordinary claims without sources. Smells like either bot troll. mandatory masks public transport weeks amount people wear wrong take soon inside train/bus staggering. 

So Americans act stupidly. Never could seen coming !  Yeah srly. Drumpf testing staff much??

I thought common cold. odd? idiots say response would something rest world did, pretty significant especially since self criticism. 

Look COVID stats countries similar Sweden Sweden. symptoms

That's going become real shit show fall arrives cold (and flu, really staying home well). that's it? story fucking telegraph game over? Meh that's part oposed everything, including taxes women's rights. Phrasing past tense going age well. finland Sounds like sonny know you’re talking honest Sorry; referring N95s. Wait, America making progress? what, many people get infected? I'd say getting better that, slipping. mean really surprising, Americans boring fucks all. I've years. Military Short hard. Yeah allot bullshit there. Non science proped science time. That's great, surely rational fellow like tell circumference circle? Hey won’t worry getting vaccine likely sound like non scientist opining science ...you're arguing *against* science here. get that, right? science nothing thing affects (and massively, amazingly fortunate coincidence) mask? someone immune compromised due autoimmune cannot afford vigilant always (the last time caught cold took 3 months fully recover missed 2 weeks work speak month). already self isolate every year cold/flu season (supported work last cold caught work, everyone else recovered days). someone chronic pain chronic fatigue maintain elevated vigilance possible others choose prioritize it. We’ve seen lot stories athletes get coronavirus. 

Has single report athlete hasn’t fully recovered ones go around chat anyone listen. work, making harder others well.

And WFH can't waste half day walking around building *looking* busy. That’s time wasn’t evidence supporting lot people honestly *want* already. Plus, part push “it already here!” wanted imply nothing worry people already it. happen often countries health authorities vigilant prevention? guess would sub ask, worried outdoor spread anymore? Seems like everyone okay protesters (and least NYC major spike after) businesses opening outdoors already. actually happened though, ""We told so"" appropriate here. Kicking self righteous prick he's appropriate shouted first time. Quick, send Covid letter upset Trump it! work, always thoughts prayers Better testing, changes demographic people infected.

We always known testing captured small percentage cases, better availability testing seeing lot mild asymptomatic cases went unreported before. 

We also know differences mortality rate mostly age distribution. virus getting weaker - scientists still saying functional difference existing strains - virus infect matters lot. infected 80 year olds, fatality would 10%, infected 40 year olds, fatality would 0.1% under. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio result. 1% Americans definitely caught virus.

Prove it. reading rest post.  Yes, especially 30-40 range. Lung problems day, everyday. mention, Scarface close 40 severe kidney damage, resulting three days per week dialysis. ""I, person research, one engaged rational discourse.""

It's easy maintain beliefs sense self-superiority never bother challenge them. Huh, I've shots Dex probably 10 times lots problems, mostly sinusitis. worst side effect anxiety. hard time sleeping it. Fauci admitted also lied. It’s good sound byte something tells one actually going enforce check people. blood clotting disease *spreads* like respiratory one. 🙁 COVID 19!
I BLOW glad u mentioned this, since assumed restaurants. appears voluntarily decided due COVID employee customer. can, requires careful diet planning avoid health problems. sort thing, guess [Spot key can't one thinking two men plastered made claim? country that? Thank informative answer covering bases. Usually masks slip I'm talking mouth moving down. use n95 often surgical masks much comfortable. I'll definitely try find better masks now. Well it. news outlets cover people might think back whether it’s good idea hit restaurant weekend many others mask.. Let's put Spanish flu context though... disease occurred time people thought lobotomies could cure PTSD mental illness, people still shit buckets, extent medical knowledge soap, bandages amputation cure almost anything. use Spanish flu road map avoid obvious pitfalls, imagine come September October going death rates 5x seen far stupid. Live South Florida. Wife needed desk lamp due working home. Decided would mask up, make quick run IKEA get out. Turns least 50% made nose off. Several seem masks possession all. skipped out, lamp wait. I've always said deaths important measurement. Cases largely meaningless factors involved. Rising cases falling deaths means lower mortality rate, meaning, less deadly thought.

I've also always said important take necessary precautions. 

So still find odd chose reply. Thanks, wanted make sure people didn’t get confused bullet point good it, ok celebrate recovery appreciate hard work took Healthcare workers reach number. 

It still deserve ""Good News"" tag. Oh no, Djokovic!

Oh absolutely love idea, gives living audience play for. Best thing I've seen year. wash N95 masks (or surgical masks, anything besides cloth). lucky enough N95, simply quarantining corner three days sufficient safety least degrading mask.

Social distancing works, people actually keep distance.  But, keeping distance requires space, *requires everyone pay attention time.*  people pay attention, people keep distance. 

Masks work, people wear them. people put mask on, pay attention constantly.  people wearing masks, wearing masks, leave decide take off.

The science become pretty clear. Masks actually work. Distancing doesn't, people maintain required distance. Quadruply sad places locked able get control long battle. Arizona taking kinds drastic measures, means likely much worse. also telling patients/customers they've exposed.

Oh, FFS. got djoking.  everything try spread it... succeeded that. Ideally use hand sanitizer (in case hands germy), adjust mask, use hand sanitizer (in case mask germy). 

Obviously practical possible real-life situations lot reasons. Since risk air transmission high risk surface transmission low, better adjust mask back nose avoid touching mask, situation cannot reasonably sanitize hands. find frequent issue, may worth looking mask sizes shapes find something fits better. mask wire nose piece stay better, full-head elastic stay better less adjustment (and less hard ears). agree. also believe complete shutdown NY helped build germaphobia us careful.

They don’t care you. own. Trust instincts trust gut. Coming bartender decade industry, lost control minute Abbott allowed bars open. Anyone works previously worked industry would see coming mile away; majority people employed exact industry younger well.

I never understand drive someone make poor decisions. Wearing mask simple inconvenience seat belt; can't certain things sure.. fucking live longer.

Pathetic. Along fucking school plan fall. Straight fucking pathetic. likely reach concentration outside mask.

The average mask (eg surgical mask) filter virus all. Since filter, accumulate.
These mask protect hold back ""virus contaminated water droplets"" sneeze, cough, speak simply breath. sure that. I'm sure anti-mask crowd would complain owning gun mandatory. Nah, tiger blood. like Charlie Sheen Constantly. Hours time. called classroom, ffs. even though masks weren’t mandatory April, virtually every business demanded wear mask going step foot premises. Lol ain’t even halftime homie wait many states lock He's right doubt evidence. Much stuff coming around corona virus poor quality.

If read one, minimum explained variance 47%. wholly convincing study, especially note many commonly recognised mortality risks included.

Besides this, little good literature mask usage even come close informed opinion far wider reading required. Sure, answer may lie mask usage, pretend study end clear confirmation bias. read WHOLE post? Indoors people PPE = death.
Out doors PPE = life.

That's science telling us.
Churches, bars, schools, visiting friends relatives kills.
Outside, away people, wearing masks: relatively safe.

Explains outbreaks churches bars almost cases protests. shitty roads lead barn aka shit US leads Trump. air handler kills virus. need masks. CDC quickly changed mind. Unlike cultists. there's political culture anti-science. One party breeding anti-intellectualism result members party doubt word experts, scientists, etc. instead look party's leaders guidance.

Then see leaders party wearing masks mocking warn virus. emulate behavior.

2. healthy, smearing pathogens onto mask, breathe back lungs. 

I think risk astronomical, article mentioned (non-Corona related) study showing nurses wore masks day (vs needed) like twice likely get lung infections. mandatory recommended. thought give people false sense confidence measures much important (social distancing particular). increase risk people used wearing them: tendancy adjust them, play them, scratch them, remove them.

You hold protest, host rally 6,000 people, church gathering people get sick. there's ones get sick. There's church choir 60 people 40 got sick, there's meat packing plants outbreak thousand people get sick. stochasticity randomness way virus spreads early stages make little bit confusing.

Theres nurse facebook lives hometown claims masks effective keeping bugs chain link fence, given 5 6 studies performed confirming usefulness, denies instead rants sun kills viruses. nurse, nurse 24 years. good news. Means fatality rate really low. many people infected shows reopening work. Keep vulnerable away, practice distancing, wear mask, wash hands slowly continue reopening. Plus new treatments (from I've reading) death rates declined couple months. really good news. Wow education understanding world misguided steeped ignorance sounds weird.

We're apparently going herd immunity society, government pretending we're not. lag. hospitalizations starting now, deaths going follow, unfortunately.

They may bit lower initial cohorts get first wave infections probably lower average age, spread continues everything going get bad fast. Even worse hospitals saturate, advances treatment reach many. ogni speranza voi ch'entrate ?

 mai perdere la speranza problem that, pretty sure quote talking one:

""Here's bad part: testing extent, going find people, going find cases,"" Trump said. ""So said people, 'Slow testing down, please.'"" prove lies, offering statements counter statements.

Do statements counter statements person? yes, ever prove lying liar contradicts themselves, rather contradicting known facts. no, already prove said match assuming malice reasonable

What big strawman. respond actually said comment, instead *imagined* saying? said lie good intentions: prevent healthcare workers shortages masks. That's opposite claims known scientifically. Mind you, mean ""to general public;""

The claims mainstream media based actual science, even plastered official guidelines like page etc. already known. look ""coronavirus asymptomatic"" without quotes, filter date range ignore everything past couple months. 

Also air spreading enclosed spaces public transportation non-issue, would healthcare workers need masks badly? Contradiction. nations quarantine place enforced nations reopening now. wish done day 1 epidemic. 

I know sort thing enforceable current administration actively politicizing virus working anyone takes matter seriously. hitting local news bad numbers well masks help? likely run vulnerable people kill Iceland either get tested quarantine get results, usually later day. quarantine 14 days. found infected, special hotel isolate in.

 provide contact info address stay well install contact tracing app collects location data stores phone case found infected.

Starting 1 July, pay test. Something $100 . assume people knew math first place, optimistic It’s still required OC actually. Masks required executive order despite said weeks ago. Company work started back office work June. strictly required law wear masks use common areas (microwaves, eat desks, etc). It’s super strict get reprimanded don’t follow. stores still require face coverings OC area knowledge. 

Testing still hard get area. places say overloaded send around circles. Doctors straight saying they’re overwhelmed COVID testing requests call back.. Fastest testing urgent care several days. still need wait days testing? It’s insane. Faster testing = faster results = less people getting COVID. one could seen coming. Everyone reopened spikes places common perception. hard bring bit like Germans love rules,"" says Preben. know - spent seven years Malmö. ""Having said that, they're polite. keep - like us Denmark. I've heard Danes Italians also observed this, heard many Nordic people use phrase describe Danes. general population particularly smart would end apoplectic ever enforced. Tories also know voter base people, won’t ever anything means they’ll lose single vote even people die. whole point lockdowns reduce deaths protect health care systems. 

The number deaths came nowhere near ridiculous figures ICL came flawed modelling.

The hospitals over-run. fact half practically empty Nightingale Hospitals even used. 

This dangerous virus, dangerous. 

If were, really think countries would re-opening? really deadly, ""second wave"" predictive models? none. whole thing overblown beginning. 

OK - shutdown bit make sure things get hand - haven't. Time get back living again. wear mask. family wears masks. panicky fool reads every stupid fucking sensationalized headline gospel. Keep tho! We've quarantine 4 months. government body health organization says takes 4-6 weeks virus show. Find sources majors sources showing 5 day median incubation 14 max.

I live Canada we've reopened everything plumetting cases weeks end. boo.

Nobody needs GTFO, since constitutional right enter state. Ill sure visit land border reopens July Germany open schools since 6 weeks. overall situation good, manageable. smaller outbreak nothing worrying. Younger children isolated class. Older ones abide hygiene rules. Seems work. Orlando ain't Miami, either. probably packed city probably everyone else. vaccine, unless you’re willing stay locked rest life, you’ll probably get it. Hopefully case it’s possibility. Cool, potential ideas promote discussion.

What flaws ones?

Do ideas potentially enforce it?

I’ve also discussed another reply simple threat fine might act deterrent.

3. It’s overstepping boundaries, it’s allowing police police work every single little thing currently responsible for.

Should police monitor picks dog shit? community really impacts step up?

That could also happen two ways:
(Again city holiday areas)

1. Strike conversation somebody don’t recognise, doesn’t confrontational chat, steer said chat towards distinguish here

2. snitch. know somebody rented holiday home next isn’t area isn’t following potential quarantine, report them.

A people getting fined might deter people travelling flew Florida answer Actually, believe 1st cases Ny came Europe, so..... time 25th amendment yet? mean point millions recovered right? dont actual data likely is?

It always seems like fear mongering ‘Very strongly(in bold) recommend’ 

How Danish ‘recommendations’ strong compare Swedish ‘recommendations’? study Netherlands checked people recovered home. 6% made full recovery, 60% still problems walking stairs, taking shower, etc. Basically bedridden. months infection. tourism, local media &amp; state bed could always open borders countries let rest US in. someone explain means? mean vitamin helps fight Covid beyond regular strengthening immune system? wonder long admit he's complete fuck up.

That one's easy. Never. Yes, freeway either. NY State 1000 miles borders. can't feasibly count everybody crossing it, let alone stop enforce quarantine. That's mention many people live different state one work in. 

BUt able enforce 100% mean bad idea. Sure, easy individuals violate order, would much harder businesses. leave enough paper trail , fine sending employees state manner compliant quarantine. Any. Functioning. Adult. Oh really? remember reading nicotine covid use receptor lungs nicotine use damage receptors time. clue actual validity though, would interested read point I’m sure we’ve looked bit argument masks reduce spread, therefore reducing Reff. 

That essentially means threshold herd immunity lowers relation effective masks are, masks prevent need herd immunity (unless argument masks alone lower R 1, think there's evidence suggest). wrong.

Explain me, American, able travel go spend money Europe, bad America?

This intention limit trade goods. precaution limit movement PEOPLE prevent re-innoculation cases hotspot. 

I ain't mad (well am, government countrymen failing me) - seems wise prudent decision Europe, widespread behavior. New Zealand Stamped virus home, pop back due people arriving high risk countries (most recently India Pakistan). 

Europe choosing forefeit tourism money would flowed America, calculation resulting spike disease would net loss. That's probably good decision immediate near future. Maybe we'll get shit together 8 weeks policy change.

If lucky enough country besides America, would want keep us out, too.... agree that. read, ""he's done"" meaning can't get reelected. understand reason laws work expect people respect law, right? everyone said, murder cool, ignored laws would way possibly enforce law murdering people.

You make law, expect people respect law, catch (just like caught Hawaii, mostly people reporting violations social media), punish law.

Most people respect law. set roadblocks shit. risk getting turned authorities fined/jailed.

Saying way enforce defeatist ridiculous. enforce laws? respect law society fear punishment don't. continue reopen safely. Reopening prematurely may shortcut quick money, path lawsuits, long term mistrust company known superior theme park safety standards. 

Disney world pretty much anti-depressant. annual pass holder despite living far state. already cancelled trip April rescheduled August, almost certainly also canceling unless something changes dramatically then. can't wait get back Disney World. They'd dumb reopen 3 weeks planned. dumb Disney Springs open right now. I'm uptight one wanting distance now... Rhode Islander, watching say couple months ago threw tantrum governor mandated self quarantine New Yorkers entering state, can't help agree. Nah we're going worse started. back least many people paying attention concerned, ""over it"". Sure. also dictator might good intentions put place policies negative, unforeseen consequences.  rest world certainly thinks way, there's literally another US guy thread unironically calling boss master case pandemic offering free treatment means person go infect people damage. thought well established already even care study Spanish flu ended? referenced response. researchers believe gene mutation ended pandemic. pressures present current pandemic. Further, populations much less dense much less mobile. Spanish flu managed infect estimated 30% world population. Welcome reddit, politics king Yep. done already? Covid-19 importantly case US proves dumb population is. ample evidence shows Americans really dropped ball keeping virus spreading. trumps fault -he's idiot charge people listen listen blindly trump followers. 

But fair say US system, behaviour citizens main thing, health citizens. true unhealthy people generally avoid getting virus they're smart behaviours. Yeah, sources find confusing gets. seems like unions think employer punish Danes follow recommendations quarantine time. never used terminology. made right decision. 

“He also acknowledged masks initially recommended general public first responders feel strain shortage PPE.

He explained public health experts ""were concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply."" Sadly it’s truth. bottom 25 percent unemployed infected, impact profitable Apple, Amazon Microsoft are.

Separately - market artificially pumped right it’s scary. Fed interest rate cuts bond buying keeping interest rates artificially low else money go. upper middle class still flush wasted stimulus checks, much gave money kids play Robinhood. don’t get started PPP program bought thousands small business owners boats.

But Merri go round spin long. Eventually countries tire money printing... ever cut unemployment? I've watched every press conference, yet see say that. JFS director said it, reversed couple days joking, they’re likely waiting stock market sells fed’s monetary policies can’t support stocks anymore.

Everything response linked stock market opinion. entire run end March June? Hardly talk stimulus. market one really bad day? sudden new monetary policies stimulus talks back on. I'd rather Fauci someone else going around saying Chinese hoax. Ehhhh governer California seems intelligent US governers I've heard about. first institute shelter place order. he's made mandatory wear masks public.

People US lot freedom. situations, that's awesome. others, like pandemic, means lots people choose endanger others.


It's ""California"" responsible spread covid state. individual California responsible actions.

I'm California, spent time together friends family person since early/mid-March. tough, feels good knowing I'm everything keep others safe. 25th amendment already. Vegas casino worker can't say are, definitely are.   nymphets He's also wrong Vaccines. former. Hes stupid, stupid. i’d love friend buy good doctor beer Yikes! media reporting that? Logically would think it’s detrimental European nations’ economies lost tourism revenue. Don’t understand logic behind assertion US citizens able travel Europe would pretty harmful US economy relative EU nations vis-à-vis potential decision. Maybe missed something. please clarify? far know nearly every country let citizens lock travel ban. Especially EU, see letting EU citizens future.
There exceptions, north macedonia banned citizens coming back (as told colleague there) prevent spread due migrant workers coming back.
It might case way travel flights/other transport. that's another story. Get back two weeks death surge. it, far. strategy try hold together November. election trickle bad news again. mean wouldnt good thing surge cases get winter months virus spreads easily people already antibodies? risk going places anyway Well, isn’t CA running deficit fed helping them. first amendment, hard reopening safely. assume reinforced health system robust, Newsome saying this, wonder wtf three whole months needs muscle wants Central Valley respond. Aside entertainment restaurants Tulare County barely saw change came ""lockdown"". sheriff Police already claimed enforce wearing face masks

 saying virus overblown ever theme sub? I've months, miss something? Ummm...people die H1N1 flu every year. clear everybody else except Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Anywhere near Long Beach. older couple scream us yesterday helping refused wear masks. offered free. refused 'on principle' 'none guys going get sick.' probably me, might worth asking general ""vibe"" surrounding covid vaccines right now? lot optimism mass distribution early September? That’s great! one regard, existing safety nets seem working. Otherwise though? Nope.  mean, binary yes no. Enforcement highly publicized handful cases gives good examples consequences. However, number travelers far surpasses examples. Driving Waikiki feels pretty similar pre-pandemic (there weeks emptiness). also reports tourists led/driven neighborhoods farther away normal tourist areas, kind fucked considering old people told go around walks neighborhoods since deemed safer going crowded areas.

So, conclusion, weak enforcement local intervention, really strong enough deter people want social media infamy. Iceland Italy going pissed. Yes, way open countries little spread. Easily done Scandinavia, block Sweden. won’t allow (except exempted groups) even quarantine till deemed safe. Daily hundreds Swedes stopped turned away borders Finland, Denmark Norway. 

It untrue still locked down...compared Sweden open recent weeks. (internal travel ban Sweden opened...others never one internally)

Oh, maintain well vaccine comes. see goes july August...that 4.5 months since lockdown. think shouldnt protest like bunch tools first place. also, Trump says kidding says wants slow testing down. even quoated saying never jokes. No, Americans say, ""Why would want go Europe anyway?"" Please show RCT shows hand washing effective preventing vital respiratory infections.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Getting infections hospitals quite common. people believing won’t get virus? driving (I take kid truck “roadtrip” 3 times week break monotony don’t stop... see many people without masks, people local beach, etc..

Is COVID something last checked, needed masks, social distancing, least 6 feet distance, etc...

Im TX btw..we noticed thing rented (and scrubbed down) cabin woods. Everyone out. Someone came cabin put mask looked like nuts.

Wtf going on? What's free master, forced something? employer making work unsafe conditions, fuck suppose go Holiday World today, overslept didn’t anything crazy pup GOOD STOP CITIZENS COMING JERSEY SHORE! Great thanks info! I’ll make new mask husband today throw others washing machine! team members (employees) tested positive company &amp; media isn’t reporting add this, time year Florida people indoors AC (I know South FL). Way hot walking around day. opposite probably true Netherlands, people usually take advantage summer months outdoors enjoy warmer weather. This, top people wearing masks acting like Covid gone, compounds problem. 

It's little unfair Americans either staying locked down, like nothing happened. see fairly decent level compliance mask-wearing Miami area. yet see mask-less person supermarket. people going lives (going work/shops/what you) social distancing careful. are, however, large section careless individuals going bars giant house parties... would totally surprised fairly small number super-spreaders disproportionate amount damage, least South FL. It'll harmful Europe's economy. Trump impose sanctions he'll take insult I'm mom 3 heart seriously goes anyone pregnant giving birth pandemic. Pregnancy birth newborns hard overwhelming even fathom ways Covid makes million times complicated. probably cut unemployment end presser, lol. Sounds like job local health officials, whatever say NFL! exhaled droplets come many different sizes. heavy ones going drop air pretty quickly, light ones going get easily ""carried away"" breeze.

So long lingering one spot: either close infected person, downwind within 6-12', likely inhale large amount droplets and/or viral particles. 

As soon get location wind blocked obstacles (including people) air begins stagnate - particles linger, multiple exhalations allow build concentrate one location. think shouldn’t reopen? Brian Dugan yeargan reads like name Jake peralta came chasing Swedes. prude ruin otherwise good joke

Comedy isn’t thing. sayin... 

And let’s honest... people say “I’m blocking you” never do. ego won’t let them. see reply. Yes. Same. damn, PA crushing Corona! Congrats (so far)! confirm, work small hospital big city. I've 5 years almost ALWAYS 75-80% capacity, sometimes even higher depending season. Let's it, man. Let's jump fuckin shark Build wall! Build wall! Well, least natural immunity (assuming lasts while), take vaccine. may done purpose. Yep. biggest reason takes long enough funding really tricky virus like HIV actively hides, attacks suppresses immune system (which covid 100% anything like HIV worry). People like say ""we never Coronavirus vaccine expect now?"" truth never really needed one... coronavirus causes sniffles bad symptoms quick onset, easily recognizable, easy contain. Man sorry never intended offend you. sound great. Please Stay safe can. Wish best. whole sub circle jerk dispair attempt justify unconscionable fear.

I'm Texas. We're fine. personally know 3 people got it. 1 asymptomatic, 1 sick (""worse flu"") 3 day better (still quarantined 11 days), 1 ICU (caught Tennessee) due preexisting health conditions age.

Deaths WAY down. see case stat mention attempting cause fear.

Be cautious, safe. fearful. Instead they’re making eat lunch indoors desks, social distancing. Wrong priorities.  Came say: one state thing certainty, since major flaw new drug could present *any* stage development. added UK Ireland official proclamation announced it. normal human behavior. Lotta ppl believe comforts reality slaps faces. real, unedited title used one main news agencies Russia report stage 1 vaccine clinical trials (which lot people may aware even ongoing): translation article contains lot information headline.

Story? Story!

My great great uncle testpilot nazis, crash landed flee belarus, catched soviets, escaped lived betwen sides, traded weapons battlefields food think 2 years. Never could used right arm fully injured crash. think twice complain. Tocilizumab (Actemra) identified China early (known beneficial use late Feb), IV drug hard produce, transport, store. story Anakinra (Kineret) similar drug. 

I taken notes March 8th checking investment strategies possibly even getting emergency supply one Covid turned bit worse. I'm insider, googling around see China already figured something out, had. use successfully treat rich powerful since beginning. even tearful doctor news April talking survived thanks Actemra guilty felt got others died around him. 

The idea new information tantamount disinformation; however, news effective.  LOL I'm English mate, fought beaches. Thank ""reopen economy~"" states learning object lesson experts tried explaining:

You save economy thru premature reopening. choice experts picked reducing spread sparing economy. options ""bad economy tons death zero consumer confidence overrun hospitals"" ""bad economy LESS death preserved consumer confidence, preserved healthcare function, ability move cautiously forward"" economy bad long Corona exists, destroy consumer interest many previous drivers economy, depressed demand translates depressed consumption thus shedding jobs.

Some states heard above, stubbornly interpreted mean ""the economy bad long choose acknowledge corona exists"" thus decide obvious solution disregard risk open back up.

This outcome seeing AZ, TX, etc. precisely experts mean stress opportunistic infection AP0L1T1CAL (thanks automod). cannot defeat coronavirus minimize impact society ""controlling narrative"" refusing acknowledge reality. social issue people choose disregard socially isolated away problem, biologically opportunistic virus. Nobody safe nobody ignore it.

NY figuring meaningfully reopen. Texas shot face Rona tried ""prove something"" reopning. okay, i'll bite. Please tell thing. 

NY exported covid nation, he's acting like we're taking NYC? Comon! No, got stockholder reports.

I wish broken bit more. Honestly, reminds happened [Mattis Trump suggests unhinged shit and, he's gone, smarter people decide Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad launched chemical attack civilians April 2017, Trump called Mattis said wanted assassinate dictator. “Let’s fucking kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill fucking lot them,” Trump said, according told president would get right it. hanging phone, told senior aide: “We’re going that. We’re going much measured.” national security team developed options conventional airstrike Trump ultimately ordered.

Slowing testing total fucking lunacy malpractice anyone half brain, surprise probably resisted order. 1000 city petitioned get head health department removed due mandatory mask wearing, Canada 45 minutes west Toronto. actually check every day morbid curiosity see far go. 


EDIT : forgot mention, quite people city go neighboring cities outside health departments jurisdiction shopping respective health departments enforce mask wearing. Tons Americans? Lol hell even typing. refusing handwash? list  health/medical conditions preclude exacerbated wearing face covering.  age 12. Children age 2 age 12 encouraged wear face coverings required so.  disabilities prevents using face covering described Directive. persons must reasonably accommodated allow access goods services.  color heightened concerns racial profiling harassment due wearing face coverings county includes Disney World 300% cases last two weeks.

no lol. unless talking MODELS predicting death numbers. models change based current data that's bad thing? Would bad Disney loose some? what's harm letting one WORLDS largest Media empires fall little. said Megacorps loosing money. Would really bad lost foothold world?

__edit say thinking:__

Alot companies, Disney, financial support build back blows over. Avengers Starwars make amount they've lost seem like nothing. ""Loosing money"" going end Disney, going Board members/Big wigs/Higher-ups Disney get FAT bonuses already gotten FAT paychecks. trust government fuck   Everyone likes call good examples democracy bad ones totalitarian. LKY failed initiatives- people would’ve compared SIngapore North Korea. not? call democracies sense. You’re measuring results rather processes. dad (61 years old) cartoonish stereotype political alignment, always refused wear seatbelt ""The government get tell what's safe me."" He's gotten many tickets understand still driver's license.

I'll let draw conclusions aforementioned political alignment auto mod delete comment. But, know. US, specific stereotypes really stereotypes anymore much embarrassing reality.  let's say sick covid February never got test. Next week getting antibody test shows case added total? think going get control end August. Maybe forced infected back long term care centers.

Just thought. definetly worried too. take couple stupid Americans spreading virus undo hard work minimize virus. Unfortunately DNRs notoriously difficult enforce, often really come play hospital nursing home direct control care DNR available hand. common EMTs comply unless form readily available fully completed, otherwise discretion (and resuscitate unless 100% sure legit?). 

There also big problem culture US allow people die old age unless can't helped. view pretty selfish, lot people simply know pain that's borne many elderly they're safely locked away ""homes"". There’s another hero doctor (to forum) hasn’t apologized said wrong, either.    We’re still worse started. haven’t finished first wave yet! It’s leveled now. Please easier Canada extend travel ban well.  lol yup remember like “oh boy state got first case now?” went away sudden get “Texas reports new record amount cases” notification think “oh yeah remember days back beginning year. get deep discounts hotel chains.  end? vaccine comes half population gets inoculated? doubt 40% population gets infected vaccine comes out. mean get morbid...  saw too. get wonder percentage would could break parks' revenue. second favorite player. Hope gets better soon Hey judgment here. think moments like wakeup call put value healthy (myself included).  


With fact they've found outdoor activity low risk, inside spaces opposite, personally would limit number people welcome home you. already room now, give good wipe open window leave, I'm sure it'll okay time.  


Do pool nearby? heat issue maybe could take kids pool. opposite Trump said slow testing? Sounds right, stay ignorant Better would surge US healthcare's biggest wet dream

A highly infectious disease kill, seriously mames... creating lifelong customers. home states bad track? Japan never experiencing much initial spike despite taking significant action.

?!

By early-mid Feburary Japan closed every school country issued national testing, distancing isolation recommendations, began testing scale US reach another 2 months.

They put hard travel restrictions place right away.  wore masks ubiquitously.

They beat prepared, took action early.  Presumably, cost passed client. European countries (except sweden) locked long hard needed bring virus control. US didn't. length time irrelevant, result counts.

And look Google mobility data, Sweden actually isolating better US, without government mandate. I’ve using outline well options fail.

Add “outline.com/“ address clean article get past paywall. doesn’t always work options always good. certain destinations, rather nationality. typically current EU travel blocks work, otherwise would dumb people reason wear P100 mask grocery shop get public transit. entire cities like NYC huge tourist destinations.

Yet.


""I’ve honestly never embarrassed ashamed American.... yet.""


Give another week. pull N already, stupid. Ok dozen problems this,
A) can’t reference 1950s like “oh, fast vaccines same” that’s bad logic. Let’s think this, tech testing manufacturing worse back then, everything safer better, shown since first “vaccine” intentionally giving people cow pox would get small pox, tech better fast vaccine today less likely dangerous, there’s still risk, obviously, it’s fair comparison polio
B) getting vaccine first dude, might gotta wait regardless
C) safety issues found within 3 months, exceptions generally speaking risk something like narcolepsy popping low 
D) waiting see might hurt people turn kill people can’t get vaccineded simply someone hunch might dangerous 
E) produce vaccines faster now, testing J Js Ebola vaccine done within year two considered safe effective Masks you, they're others. masks using relatively little actually protect ton coronavirus air. infected, fewer breath droplets land people. Sure, spray mask coronavirus touch start touching eyes/nose/mouth, increase chance getting infected. That's happens real world. We're trying reduce likelihood infectious dose disease released know land others. opinion varies day day tbh. Theres pretty dumb people there. we're seeing effects protesting?

Maybe ""three weeks"" instead ""two weeks,"" safe. Florida it. road block highways coming Florida. spite, think.

Do know many people come NY every year? Remember shit fit NY threw states wanted protective measures NY get shit together? world's largest retirement community huge geriatric population. spite trying actually deal things everyone lose shit every attempt to. getting pressure debark, house, deal travel thousands crew ""stranded"" foreign ships less day country registration. ridiculous. trot old shoddy amp link every time get opportunity to. 

The source use speculative, numbers presented since clear. thought supposed use original title. vote supposed automatically remove post doesn’t match original title, mods deliberately let title through?  There's good chance Djokovic players testing positive may become permanently contention, given competitive tennis level [significant persistent permanent lung damage. None provide evidence numbers actually are. One accusation, one says US undercounting much last list tests various countries done. fucking knew  wouldn’t he? would also know answer questions. Sorry say never happen Trump charge. turn US vs World petty little tit-for-tat fight, base eat crap thinking he's true patriot. never accepts responsibility anything spin everything favor. sickening. testing? Yet federal testing program shut June 30 renewed. announced today. thinking reminds generic father sitcom least. “Whatever, Dad!”  Funny place works. come doubters. Yet, articles like ""1 3 people recovered COVID-19 could face PERMANENT damage!"" similar treated gospel, anyone thinks otherwise COVID denier stupid shit. 

Nope, narrative here. listened earlier Apr ordered State open overruled local municipalities' stay home orders.

Fact is, assuming cant new data saying immunity temporary. 

That's wishful thinking pandemic that's deadly. That’s thing current economic leaders (the US China), dependence reciprocal. got down-voted one recent articles saying exact thing (in relevant comment, divisive). I'm confused repeating articles studies bad, article right read. Must thin skin here. Anyway, hope reading article dogging me. Enjoy day that's even possible.

It’ll kill virus mask leave car sun though. seems sensible option, hey, there's buck made tends blind people's common sense country. it. thing realize cases showed CA well March, local officials already planning lot things even locked down. NY simply lack testing much focus placed Asia [most cases actually came result detection late NY time cases showed up, community thousands cases yet detected.

There lot contact tracing isolation place many CA counties early early detection. obviously enough, see exponential growth days screw overall outcome.

I place blame Cuomo lot relied early CDC response testkit screwup certainly help. make excuses NYC dense population, remember world class cities like Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, even many Chinese cities ultimately experience disaster saw US. like true feels... CNN reported Trump said. Oh, please. get residents wear masks, tyvm. split time NYC PA, really go anywhere public much NY, last week 75% people I've seen street maskless. chin-covering morons.

I've worked Danish suppliers couple years, Danish might rusty. moron. change dictator every 8 years.

Wtf? gonna remove comment replied then??? really quite unfortunate feasible. province Canada enforcing mandatory 14 day quarantine come different province, likely get refused border entry unless actually live here/have cottage, immediate family. 0 active cases things mostly back normal.

On side things provinces done domestic travel quarantine rules they're much worse us, total cases active cases. Unfortunately you’re gonna people think they’re going get it, wrapped personal narrative see bad derided happening people, *them*.

Plus add many already infected protests. one knows  Maybe. honestly know believe anymore. turned cluster fuck conflicting reports health agencies, parties leveraging attack one side other, models wrong almost every step way...Nothing find thing would surprise point. It’s worth noting France handles overseas territories differently US does, many French overseas departments part France proper administrative differences Metropolitan (European) departments France, like Alaska US state despite administrative differences compared lower 48. Qq6rr.7 m77 5G 767rj insane, I've using mask supermarket, gas station, work, etc.. Half people see wearing masks, president misleads base tells people wear masks want to, contrary Fauci recommends. going beat virus POTUS gives zero fks situation?? help reelection chances? I'm masks, distancing, vigorous hand washing.

But this...this cannot support. level abstinence, anyway. anyone know early pandemic? true, also means vaccine option, lockdowns delayed inevitable.  Delaware report yesterday probably multiple days worth Entire countries enforcing quarantines visitors cant even get one state This. also 1) strictness lockdown 2) *timing* *rules* reopening. Florida reopened (never closed really) peak curve rather declining phase. reopened one month later would different. 3) travel restrictions: Italy could walk steps outside home, US could fly Orlando Spokane. meant South Italy never really experienced issues hospital capability (despite awful hospital capability) exactly random untrained redditor predicted far back April 6: wonder look back FDA/CDC insisting face masks nothing buy one absolute biggest mistakes made process.  seems like east Asian countries wearing face masks culturally acceptable immediately encouraged/mandated, going way, way, way better outcomes every western democracy go mask Asian countries pretty clearly better across board, holds, might interesting analysis case. hypothesis cultures, mask wearing merely culturally acceptable downright mandatory pandemics.

Prediction mask fiasco one worst seems panning well. This. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. percentage population that?

Overall though impressed people trying. Walmart employees still dumb box rocks, overall got needed got reasonably good experience. models struggled accurately predicting hospital capacities. Nevertheless, even people going hospitals faster expected, deaths deaths. lot them. want Trump baby balloon! sacrosanct traditions Caesar assassinated

Tell right wing-nutters: Duh!  protecting you, protecting some, keep up. we're rich, spend money stuff like trying cause regime change countries, military, police, football games leaving us money education healthcare. fuckton restrictions everywhere keeps control. Would like see masks rolled out. 
Edit: people wear masks social distance cannot kept, however rarely needed. (It’s Maggie)

Why lie this? deserve Upvoted!  This. need way viable political parties, otherwise, continue road polarization.   Also horseshoe theory confirmed. social justice crowd must patting back this, actual white supremacists might also cheering kills minorities disproportionately good chance today, June 23rd 2020, official start second wave US.

While already inflection case numbers, today first time inflection daily deaths, compared week week. June 16th 849 deaths, far June 23rd 850 deaths. haven;t weekday weekday increase since early May. increasing numbers cases, hospitalizations really bad day US - get respite virus summer like hoped for. might lose professional sports seasons rate.

June, July August least 20,000 deaths - putting us somewhere 160,000 - 175,000 deaths Labor Day. Hard see things getting better fall - we'll probably see southern wave head back North September October. Probably well. likely required vaccine covered US Honestly, speaking another RI native, makes announcement genuinely piss off.

Let record show worst part COVID New York State, NYC epicenter COVID United States, Rhode Island took super seriously enforced quarantine come state immediately, New York's response ""that's neighborly you"" demanded ability head beach house RI wait pandemic and/or use less packed hospitals Rhode Island...and now, audacity did? Fuck off, NY. We'd respect said ""We're IMPORTANT Rhode Islanders, deserve overrun hospitals let Rhode Islanders die, die? gives shit, killed Red Sox fans, Lord's work."" blame them... also probably ban travel Sweden rest EU they're it. Cases rising Bay Area counties too, unfortunately. SF county seems exceptions, others showing increase. I’m sure exactly since masks always required here, wonder protests. Well, surprise there. Unfortunately, smart thing right now. Minor open came weeks back. major one coming July 4th  able afford it. guess agree disagree. said people South Atherton Sheetz wearing masks. Centre County 11 cases added today. obvious people taking seriously following precautions. almost like predicting future limited information fucking hard do. Fatty fish would better vitamin levels. Wild caught salmon certain subspecies rival supplements He’s bs’ing.

This thing happening thousands people. staying fuck home ensures happens thousands fewer. Upvoted! Deaths per million residents:

Thank God everyone wearing masks one protesting stay home order. disproportionately effects certain races negatively sort of, definition, racist. Isnt it? Outdoors always viewed safer indoors non-household members. anything supports idea hanging outdoors friends safe healthy option state-by-state basis. federal government authority mandate mask wearing. ""Where were?"" FFS, could go back ""where were.""

We MUCH worse planet month ago, 2 months ago, 3-4 months ago, it’s going get worse point.

There ""going back were."" ""*Amnesty International’s Evidence Lab verified 34 videos across Europe showing police used force unlawfully, many instances required all.* ""

This become common. hope reform stays focused fixing systematic issues like this, "" *In UK, one European countries collects ethnically disaggregated data law enforcement, police London registered 22 percent rise stop searches March April 2020. time proportion Black people searched rose nearly third.* ""

In states seems losing focus instead fixing major issues getting sidetracked statues, flags, autonomous zones. saying important well, first things first.  Upvoted! think people die covid like two days? actually retarded. virus doesn’t care race Thank NE states, including MA, make top 10 fatalities per capita. due deadly mix population density international tourism. virus least January. lockdown next nothing least month late. reduced cases today little virtuous rule-following much herd immunity happened rather quickly.


You compare smart, serious NE dumb, flippant south. south spread out, virus hit probably around time didn’t gain much traction except local spurts. southern state locked down, manageable level without big backbuild cases. already-low level day-to-day, minute-to-minute human interaction decreased even more. south, dissimilar South Korea, “too good job” early on. they’re open seeing mixed results.


It narrative make governors leaders like Andrew Cuomo heroes reality, even bringing nursing home fiasco, nothing house fire—which way, wasn’t totally fault since virus blended flu season high asymptomatic rate—and saw natural slowing cases everyone got infected once.


Masks may may answer, situations big small states different regions different variety reasons. Yeah almost Texas careening exponential growth ramp hard NY 3 months ago, moron governor figured virus exists, even months advance warning prepare. yet many people feel reason. understand it. Stay well. Despots Damn I’m bad spelling mobile. gotta favor coveting going flavor town least. Look benevolent dispots governor imbecile can't even get sherrifs enforce wearing masks businesses, way hell could reliably enforce this. per CDC. Comes right Google statistic. This...isn’t exactly accurate. issue causation related fact low vitamin levels often associated high-risk demographics (elderly, obese, etc.) nothing whether virus depletes vitamin supplies. Daily deaths lag daily cases 2 weeks, America low daily cases 2 weeks ago. week 2 now, US daily deaths expected measurably risen today. Yeah N95s go hospitals Read ""guidelines"" (the title indicates enforceable) read see many times see ""maybe"", ""whenever possible"", etc. agree  laws regulate driving make safer. thing needs happen here. Legally mandate masks. calling favor coverings now? so, like it.  unfortunate thing wearing mask politicized US. groups see wearing mask sign weakness, conversely, wearing mask equated exercising personal freedoms. politics personal rights get thrown mix, different kind social pressure influencing decisions wear mask. Couple misinformation, like kind hear Fox news, recipe people wearing masks en masse.

It strange sad makes feel embarrassed fellow Americans. global/public health issue that’s seeing as. Europe little mask usage. seem fine. favourite thing CK3? polonium poisoning. long vaccine grants immunity thats care about. Even means getting one year Certain death context ask, subjective. stormed beaches Normandy little reason believe they'd survive battle American side, accounts I've read include many 18 19 year olds faced ""Sprint spot die, comrades make another 30 yards"" came up, answered call brighter future world. me, conquering certain death.
The bombers flew landing held bombs long, defenses Omaha destroyed planned foxholes available cover. open season Americans, Americans literally outran death faced course initial hours. Although voluminous terms death compared battles like Stalingrad, Omaha beach Americans terms facing call duty world needs beyond reason.

Fuck non-mask wearing pussies thinking D-Day impressive human achievement. predictions supported sort factual known vaccine protocols processes. plenty articles normal vaccine approval testing process encompasses, long takes (years). Even pressured March, Dr. Fauci would predict vaccine year end, pushed. Truth is, vaccine rushed (but especially one gets approved FDA pre-election) likely rigorous maybe even adequate testing approval process. sure hell take one I'm sure kill people, worse, work. (Worse get vaccine work people running around false sense security, everything opens virus spreads like crazy.) Wonder impact airline industry heard story NPR budget shortfalls states. California needs something like 25+ Billion make ends meet! Michigan got 3 billion feds need least 3 biion asap!

I went local beach last Friday crowded I’ve seen (it’s place go multiple times summer since tiny I’m 40) ever life, it’s mid June. got worried. idea long takes person takes test get results part statistics? 

A coworker claims test last Wednesday haven’t gotten results back, want know bullshit enjoying paid vacation rest us biting nails worrying, posible results take 6 days long, Dallas Texas.

All find online information claiming takes 3 days get result, said information dated back March. Yea pretty sure throwing COVID patients jail bad idea. brand use make batch? used pillsbury sugar cookies dough freeze/refrigerate kept ziplocked pantry. Google said last 2-3 weeks usually month fine. 

I much food poisoning back college days cookies never betrayed lol. lot people immunocompromised think e) Drink bleach

In news: water wet.  skeptical

More like they've bought previous administrations, would correct. However Fauci power, marginalized disrespected current administration. Trump making disastrous decisions regarding pandemic. aware titles work, referring comment left after. Something along line “let’s see many people get worked without reading article”  bad US handling this, Brazil handling worse Ditto! can't tell many cases wine bottles gin whiskey we've since March. Look tomorrow 00:42 need sleep. fully deny covid risk stop change science rejecting thoughts. 

Also really offended fault. 

Kind copypasta fits perfect, again.

Why American ignoring science facts?

Because trained so. Foreign Intelligence service, traitors useful idiots established last 40 years.

""As mentioned before, exposure true information matter anymore. person demoralised unable assess true information. facts tell nothing, even shower information, authentic proof, documents pictures. ...he refuse believe it... That's tragedy situation demoralisation."" –Yuri Bezmenov  Nice synopsis.  mean chicken pox? Yeah there's serious stupidity happening financial sector right now. There's talk small comercial shift bonds end month, increasing case counts US, poor performing quarterly results, large group quite financially savvy investors driving markets. 


What happens ticker starts slide hobbiest see money flying window? Thats question. guess means also prefer Organized Crime Disorganized Crime? ;) Right? should’ve kept playing like nothing wrong exponential growth 6 players HOW?! pandemic 100 years ago messed around (in US), opened everything back soon made stretch 2 years. much smaller population, commercial air travel, less immigration fewer attractions draw crowds thousands. 

Now better arsenal medical treatments help totally inept president, thousands people flying place every day, huge numbers people think virus joke mandatory face coverings tyranny, thousands protesting shoulder shoulder, government confiscation PPE misinformation good. 

I'm firmly convinced least United States big problem 2 years. 5 months since virus made already near-Depression levels unemployment, rising food prices shrinking availability due plant closures falling production day one federal government screwed response every turn. election year makes worse. Even Biden wins foolproof plan fix every mistake made Trump good, chaotic get going. I'll bet million dollars steak dinner I'll cook myself, plan. 

All tells me, gotta prepare things get REAL BAD. give zero fucks things opening again. I'm still living lockdown lifestyle like months ago. go work go home. That's it. unnecessary trips anything. Always wear mask wash, wash, wash hands. Dining going movies events is...not going happen long damn time, ever. I'm still stocking food I've planted food plants space for. buy ammo every payday I'm constantly watching wildlife around hunt meat know find it. I'm learning identify edible wild plants around practicing setting snares. Fishing gear next list. 

Some say I'm paranoid I'm going overboard. I'd love future proves right highest official land says ""Why let wash whole country?"" there's least 50% chance POS could wind (mis)managing things another 4 years...I think I'm right thing. problem GOP made voter disenfranchisement voter suppression core tenet ideology country kind shrugged accepted it. 

If US even remotely democracy, GOP wouldve forced reform decades ago. Instead keeps getting worse... people fine weapons mass destruction open anyone buy background checks surprised? Idiot trump turn political issue Stupidity consequences.  /r/ShitAmericansSay  talk second wave, guess talk seasonality. second wave come disguised influenza winter. going bad. Hahahahaha exactly hospitalization rate COVID-19 94.5 per 100,000. people recovered hospitals. can't find statistics many saw health care professionals even 100 non-hospital health care contacts per hospitalization would still true people recovered without intervention.

From me. can’t act like country testing capability tests found late didn’t work. can’t shut subway data presume developing country. one would expected feds would fuck badly. realized immediately shut things down. countries actually didn’t lockdowns knew cases via actual data. yeah. know Canada told self-quarantine cross border, they'll send someone randomly check whatever address gave and/or call.

Sure, spreads easily ships. mean disease causes becomes magically different patient happens ship. guess I'm 40% Could false positives? work nurse southwest Missouri. getting several positive swabs asymptomatic patients employees negative retested days later. yet see symptomatic positive covid. don’t lot faith testing. agree, see level deaths saw April ever again. made advancements treat thing. pipeline trials going summer result even better treatments targeted disease. Yeah. Temperature checks superficial lines defense. Ugh. Samsung stores Seoul temperature checks crying loud! Ugh. Look. I’m sheltering, I’m masking, I’m distancing, certainly letting guard down, millions people it....a handful (likely reactivated) cases single study less 100 subjects indicate dire situation. Yeah.

# COVID-19 Rage 'Like Forest Fire' Unprepared Southern American States, Top Doc Warns They’re really miserable people Nearly 945,000 people county tested virus received results, 8% testing positive, officials said. **That rate remained steady past several weeks.** 

The **average daily number hospitalizations decreasing since late April**, Ferrer said Friday, although note slight increase past three days. 

LA country seems ok two important metrics, test positivity rate hospitalization rate. get super concerned unless 2 numbers start climbing. However, 8% test positively rate good, want &lt;5%.  Hypotheses based evidence. evidence support hypothesis, going test hypothesis? Honestly, USA needs learn rest world much much regional containment. Australia's states close borders entirely non-essential travel, set regional containment zones WA currently considering lock-down orders local government areas COVID family hotspots order 20 cases per day Victoria. We've successfully isolated COVID areas eliminated country.


Most US states little COVID months ago they'd border controls USA national spikes across country we're seeing today. Ignorant people get angry cannot understand.  This. 
I live Appalachia. healthcare systems around absolute trash. Ballad health came in, bought everything up. Since hospitals dropped rating, several remote ones closed weren’t profitable enough. 

Everyone around praised healthcare systems none overrun “like said would be”, number confirmed cases area minimal rural + quarantine. people think it’s either fake, over, bad made be. one wears masks, half restaurants aren’t implementing social distancing, rare find place business even require employees wear mask. 

Meanwhile, state list spikes infections hospitalizations, I’m terrified next couple months bringing area. antibodies remain long time. antibodies reduced 2-4 months need tons floating around. Memory Cells important. mount immune attack COVID 5+ past getting overcoming disease. Ok, is. given recovery obviously good news. fact 200 million recoveries would great news, right. would probably generally reflect situation good whole. Right wrong? situation US good, whole?

See, here's thing. People try say 1 million recoveries bad, reflect good general situation, nutters. fair statement? Considering NYC Long Island general, like, places, avoiding 80% population getting within first month freaking miracle. We’re densely packed hell, regular tourists/dual residents world. didn’t think shot semblance win virus first showed here, I’m pleasantly surprised we’re starting recover all.

Android - settings - Google settings - covid. Funny thing is, masks never took Denmark Norway. Yet countries quite well. many masks seen New Zealand either believe. think Southern US states like  can't make stuff We’ve tried nothing, ideas! California big place, hard generalize.

Thousands people die every day. It’s time shut regions United States again. Thanks insight. Despite absolutely horrible pretty interesting read about, say.

The biggest thing I’m interested missed deaths seem indicated excess deaths. national even global analysis true death toll would fantastic read Let’s make latinx thing people! going keep coming going. states really lowered numbers. However, numerous states opened without precautions. Strap long ride. local governments starting mandate businesses now. judge ruled businesses, course Abbot pretending totally cool whole time he's super glad now. He's full figure? Sweden deaths per capita moment. needs study way sure correlation due random chance. There's lot things thought common sense ended false studied. said, mean waited study come wearing masks. people already worn masks, study showed effect, wear piece fabric face. showed effect, well would've protected others.

Wear damn mask people! Nothing sneeze at. asking study coronavirus make sense. literally watching scientists go scientific method new worldwide virus pandemic. That's new evidence hypothesis theories change quickly. It’s bad CDC said to. Username checks out. Slyly try wish death sickness upon family opposing viewpoints.

Orange County aggro conservative ultra entitled. might taking Florida Man comes leading stupidity covid. Thank you! 😁👍 People wait see approach Florida month refuse admit wrong. Florida 1/10 cases New York response 10x better. Time continue show that. Mask positive here, rosy. People use mask, goverment can't protect us, bunch corrupt ignorant politicians. people look ways help themself, inventive lack resources. Lucky, simple measures effective point. 

Our health care system joke, many advanced ICUs even main cities, less smaller cities.

We trying survive shit, virus killing 10s lower 100s day even 3 months lockdown (enforced police military non less). Economy toilet, lots people 0 money, goverment give money help.

At point think people take best precautions (vitamin d, mask, social distance, washing hands, lower obesity, etc), hail mary opening. cases jump again, think people take another lockdown, even gunpoint. Well stay safe hopefully opened soon. Really looking forward aggressive swat teams tear gas! R governors apparently still believe now. Good luck November btw, make sure attend rallies many loved ones possible. I've pulling data [JHU Covid spreadsheet since mid March noticed decoupling around May 25th.

And saw story;

Wear mask? VIOLATING RIGHTS!

Makes zero sense... [paper actually ""IFR estimates ... 0.19% (0.17-0.22% 95% credible set) ILI surge adjusted account asymptomatic subclinical cases."" died cliff jumping? coronavirus? Deaths gradually falling (albeit weirdo weekly pattern) throughout time period.

That’s it’s best look rolling 7 day average consistently falling two months now. peak 2200, today it’s 619 72% decrease. Also think vast majority us never much expectation current admin, surprise WHO. far. despite talk 'waves', coronavirus wild fire, ocean. New York caught lightning strike. Florida handing everyone gasoline book matches telling go play woods. Like done already. Makes sense. Nearly every time I've caught cold bug last years immediately attending child's birthday party. Especially Chuck E Cheese, trampoline parks, similar human petri dishes. quarantine law S. Korea permits official epidemiologists access surveillance data public/private sectors without search warrant emergency, includes phone gps positioning logs, credit card transactions, public transportation logs, CCTV records, etc. know external germs get onto hands, right? touching inside renders mask useless Patrons wear tables. I’m sure doctors getting better it, think mass availability testing helping death rate. Back March, wasn’t nearly enough tests very, difficult get one COVID-19 unless less already hospital yeah, death rate’s gonna higher patients getting tested that’s time really get one. already sick place positive results coming back 

It ridiculous. got sick March tried get COVID-19 test shot everywhere hadn’t done traveling recently, couldn’t *prove* contact someone it. go outside, cough, almost immediately offered even told get tested COVID. Tally (from perspective) less 1 4 chose wear masks retail situations I've seen. Probably closer 1/ 8... Take care... Fingers crossed get hit somewhere ....bye Donny 👍🤣🤣🤞 ""breathing spreads virus"" even different ""cover mouth sneeze"" I’m pretty rural spot, although Missouri. Closest hospital equipment &amp; facilities exactly four people Covid-19. Four. Wow, quite finding.

Apparently solve issues, one must take action.

Thank you, Governor Abbott It’s sooooo hard touch mask. Especially I’m shopping, bend get something falls little bit. breathe starts fogging glasses. adjust it.

Also, I’m little confused careful touch it. Like I’m walking around someone virus breathes me. Wouldn’t virus get clothing too? It’s like it’s gonna make beeline face ignore rest world. can’t actually fly purpose. 

So touching shirt would impact touching outside mask.... 

I feel washing it. throw mine laundry basket regular clothes wash end week. I’m sterilizing regular clothes, don’t need sterilize masks. Well sounds like genocide extra steps. world lit ire.  injected light body. Rid virus 35 min. Truly amazing 
I’m sorry, but... no. three masks work 12 hour shifts. fucker come times day eat, drink, rub annoying piece ear. 

I agree list “the right thing do”, totally faithful lockdown, work day, it’s possible rigid. Right. believed then? he’s either complicit moron right? That’s force back nursing homes decision shouldn’t come shock? see Beijing, bad superspreader event. goes ballistic. *Taps head*  probably Spain, Italy, Greece summer. even car, border hours away Even protests limited three weeks. care they're open it, matters whether they're taking vast incompetence account not.

If people turn gotten infected realised, we're hit serious second wave overruns teeny tiny ICUs, bet life savings current government putting wallets first let us die first southern city US (Greenville, SC) decided ordnance require masks TODAY. Ahh see saying. Sorry, long day I'm dumb people weak pick ""easy"" targets that's less likely happen them. 

My friend small physically happens woman, harassed dozen people point, majority boomer age men.

My 6 foot male ass get shit wearing mask. get laughed people wearing one. Almost like wearing one badge pride. prolly true tbh that's best thing saying. People's mental health already taken toll worse stuff like every post would prolly make people India upset... pic gave seizure


Edit, can't stop watching though, mesmerizing! “For Logan, hopes initial results project August September, dogs could “a quick win” search Covid-19 vaccine continues elsewhere.”

Unfortunately things like take decent amount time testing training hope still there! think couldn’t get it? working home? obviously Latin American health systems greatest average, blame huge outbreak weak immune systems absurd. Brazil getting hit hard bc didnt take action. That's it. Viruses spread magically. way spread, continue allowing ways course spread said ""we see them"". reading comprehension problem?  Yeah, we're fairly alright Canada. Even calculating capita, course. permanently suspended sale alcohol. 
Nothing good comes shit. 

How many people need die dumpnthe booze lake? “The sky blue” says star witness. Imagine glitter outside.

Great, I've wearing masks whole time problems suddenly want stop forever. parents doctors, Europe thank god. easy caught it. really hard there's win: either get scolded enough masks sell ask people wear masks.

Doesn't help glorious motherland decided cheap buy masks China years ago destroyed stopped stocking making them. means masks approximately qualitative reserved doctors tell patients forbidden share :s

It's much better truly sounded like war. UK even worse shape. single recommendation weeks ago wear mask shops never repeated enforced. 

Mask wearing public transport compulsory policed. I’m optimistic. Hope brings hope pence too. swear I’m nice person, they’re terrible don’t know else hope hear air system kills virus. Imagine clap following words say me:


Because 👏genocide👏 👏the 👏systematic👏 eradication 👏of👏 👏certain 👏group 👏of👏 people🙄

It purposeful.

and virus doesnt discriminate poor rich smart stupid hes actively spreading commanding people spread virus purpose.

If want call something genocide whole call Entire worldwide pandemic genocide human race caused SARS-COV-2. 🙄 even virus doesnt agenda replicate costs.

 I'll let one leave fuck alone never goddamn genocide. signalling bad. Actually, take much care using mask.

They determined even follow protocol increase risk infection bad mask use 4x bad good mask use, STILL worth everyone using masks.

Better give advice public, people find another excuse use all. Notice intensively they’re still testing anyone comes contact president? Fauci lied effective masks Yea, considering bullshit that's happened thread alone, I'm probably gonna say 'fuck censorious bullshit' send time elsewhere.

Central LA here, N.O. vote. Risponi broke promise negative adds area went blue 30 min. LA getting hit hard Even San Francisco Oakland, people mocked Chinese people wearing masks. 

Hell, riots Chinatowns got extra vandalized. really sad. Maybe one missing components? Flag masks text “I’m wearing asshole!” Pessimism - driving force progress.

Seriously, think literally never sort treatment, actually opinion that's wrong. Norway, wore mask single day. saying work, emphasizing important get ahead things. Sucked early lockdown, really thankfull now! actively undermining things society needs, directly make billionaires richer. Cmon, Medicare Medicaid work fine, would Medicare All. You’re going government officials performing surgery you. Thank you, I'm glad pun lost you. think Abbot mistook horse llama #it grow back.

Youd think certain people would know better. Theres doctor daughters hospital tries downplay virus everyone. Common sense definitely common youd think. Nup.

The headline OP is:
""The faster country required masks, fewer coronavirus deaths had: study - National""

Im saying, China required masks comparably quickly, lot deaths.


Further, AUS NZ NEVER required masks, fewer deaths.


Im saying headline therefore shit. That's all.

Obviously, greater population = deaths, weaker healthcare system =more deaths, shutting enforcing social distancing laws = deaths.


It seems like shit headline, thats all. first bullet point, followed, mitigate risk:

* Wash hands handling mask think votes shaped future still vote. far know, found 1 person several positive December person never contact wuhan. recent trip Algeria. Although timeline trip early. certainly seems like must caught France, spreading answer arrived there.

I may wrong that's remember. gonna need sources shit, dude. Nice work Viet Nam! I'll late 30s take mother-in-law. long now. We'll best long can. Funny think know something me. Always. like Dark Ages spanned history point, sharp decrease previously pleasant time. Civilizations always potential swing heavily anti-intellectualism.

The biggest drive behind Constitution create system fall victim past mistakes founding fathers either read witnessed. can't defend stupid, though. Nothing fool proof. suppose read bleach??

Small glass bleach? public needs clap harder. Tons people pretty fucking loose definition. 

And seems one them. even thinking meeting sister-in-law? isolating low exposure. keep way, go see sisters brothers-in-law, stay away people outside household.

I leave house three times week exercise bike, full shower soap afterwards, week store, mask, washing hands soap afterwards. gf goes store week well (but we're going store together). open it. 

I could show responses would make hair stand end except one mods got particularly vindictive, went post history retroactively deleted comments sub.

Our last resort appeal head cabal vindictive person mod list (she’s usually one removing comments liberally) openly uses full name institution faculty member. However don’t recommend going route. voices* Well many also pretend exist economy pushing us too. easier justify going back normal normal keep streets. dont understand said. barrier stop germs getting out. 

If touch inside mask germs clearly problem. touching mask doesn’t stop working.  Universal mask wearing + mandatory quarantines incoming travelers + contact tracing.

America far harder trace quarantine way Taiwan did, still, excuse millions Americans willfully defiantly refuse wear masks practice distancing. Yeah Denmark Haha lot people ignored social distancing. like every country. mAsKs WoRk words ‘white people regime’ physical assault equal, even close. Snowflake. Sacramento suburbs look 95% like Texan suburbs, don’t mean politics; I’ve lived Texas live back CA, know Texan suburb looks like lol. believe that’s making move, probably seems familiar.   Oh best part, sister law question also nurse. Sigh. 

I agree you, ways get still safe. People careless. hope things get better soon too. California seems like trouble again. I'm really surprised handling well beginning one first states go lockdown. agree privilege statement. believe work home option factor. know plenty people working want go back ive worked whole thing people... person... think stupid too. 

I'm also sure supposed take away article readily apparent either...

Maybe saying thing. Yes. stopped using ventilators everyone low oxygen. Ventilators cause death needed. videos floating around nurses crying saying vents going kill patients, COVID19. Remember doctors kept getting fired well? assume lot internal conflict public aware treat this. patients COVID19 treated COVID19 sometimes simply stroke due COVID19. Notice calmed too? ""COVID19 causes strokes"" headlines? one blame completely new.

This hypothesis stuff much facts assume hospital give us matter anyway. Feel free chime would like know anyone else's opinion this. Right let's also remember elder respect made buck go Wuhan weeks anyone dared take decision.

Good fix problem one front respect wises, really really bad innovate new crisis, no? remember young doctor scolded stirring trouble, typical language gerontocracy. People tried subjects, creating splinter sub creates drama fractured community. Look /r/freefolk. 

 bothers act like simple start another sub, yet big banner front page use drive people sub thanks admins. “ keep safe informed. Visit /r/coronavirus [unless information something goes narrative mods pushing].” Home social factors things like 'will need grocery assistance quarantining' get set with... grocery assistance. risk assessment, enabling lockdowns quarantines need pick insulin next Friday die. sorry personally hate someone advocates needless death hundreds thousands lied masks hospitals didn’t run inept get either done right run n95 masks. Quite evil China steal American jobs. Americans gave jobs Chinese cheaper want them. Chinese idea make anything; American, Japanese European companies thought them. simple fact people willing pay price products made workers fully developed countries. Therefore, companies either automated outsourced workers away. bigger issue developed countries see coming adapt workforce accordingly.

Creating enemy China providing service developed countries counter productive. Muh freedom, blah blah blah... coming worst it. takes two three weeks deaths catch cases... check back July 14th... deaths elevated 12 states July 14th, I’ll happily say I’m wrong. This. many deaths could avoided due crappy job done. good enough. That's psychopathy you! I'm critical care nurse. 

You ashamed yourself. advocate ending lockdown cases rising PPE corrected. advocating makes danger. know full well people dying result ending lockdown metrics reached, even Trumps metrics, stubborn admit it. 

You're genuinely psychotic, along rest sub. look study admit, coefficient confidence interval mask wearing pretty damning. know enough multivariate linear regression works say properly control correlated independent variables masks seem massive impact. could see pure Colombian cocaine might help Fair response- hadn’t looked stats. looks like 4 cases confirmed among protestors “there evidence virus contracted there” simply political statement. Obviously can’t prove protests... family clusters.. well.. initial case family get it? know? said right- hasn’t significant number cases shown among protestors yet. still firmly believe surge sort among protestors- whether proven not.  keeping full count? Still every covid death attributed covid. current government loves looking nice paper actually care citizens Meanwhile:
“This Omaha. make us wear masks don’t get money need save us!”  Yeah that's impractical, like federal budget goes military. /s 

How would ever able deploy many troops regulate anything still fingers shoved middle easts ass reason. /s2

I guess national guard would good starting point. states even deployed first wave. Chiming South Bay Area protests -- went four protests, everyone masks on, except police (and one, media). People careful aware organizers reminded us via bullhorns make sure maintain social distance. far know, cases traced back protests, either. tell Vietnam #25.

That someone said ""Mate, list remotely credible without Vietnam."" it’s relevant. Can't second wave let first wave end - America probably. Oooo wish feature. seems like right way approach situation. like beer! Hey, Fox News: 

First all, fuck brainwashing entire family hateful cult led orange pedophile.

Now let's dig in.

We could crushed thing top slow testing EVERY TURN ADMISSION. could locked down, prepared Test, Trace, Isolate, crushed bug like countries done. Everyone wearing mask, everyone social distancing, restaurants go community spread managed. Then, hotspots pop up, lockdown area go there.

BUT NO. Half United States goddamn hotspot. gave shitton money COULD GONE FEED CHILDREN YOURE GODDAMN WORRIED IT, corporations. knows went, bc tell us. know go, that's kids pretend worried about.

Because since Fox fucking News ever cared low income children countries? encourage locking US border, scream REEEEE financial aid needy countries.

Your bullshit criminal. bullshit evil. highlight 2020 thus far protesters chased cameraman out. That's deserve, hope many chase living rooms turning channel off. May joy turn ashes mouth.

Sincerely,
Fuck you. largely mask-wearing... know everyone, fwiw relatively mask-adorned crowd Yeah. stores lysol, bleach, bleach alternatives.

I mild dish soap.

I can't even Fantastic cleaner more.

I friends work Kroger apparently stores area out.

Sugar, too. ""few bad apples"" excuse apply anymore since angry mob outside going cops' head. PA fared relatively well can’t reason people positions ideas didn’t reason to. strange every condition high comorbidity Covid19, happens one causes vitamin deficiency. 

There shitty studies. know people I’m telling you, *might* help. per original poster asking.  


You clearly want argue semantics instead facts. Don’t shit, maybe people won’t dislike much. oh wow. must exhausted realize it. ( since 5:20 am; 7:30 PM now)

its even *worse* then. Mine doesn’t even ring unknown numbers Professional baseball, football, tennis players tested positive, pretty much soon get together start practice. 

This obviously happen high schoolers.  Technically might right. wrong. I’m merely stating that’s it’s $20 refund store credit. gift card. honest point I’d rather open borders people travelling European countries order stimulate tourist economy cases low excluded scheme Brexit. know Boris would sorting travel corridors with?

US Brazil probably top list.  likely get corona virus I’m sitting 6-7 feet away someone room window open? Trying decide it’s risky person therapy therapist sees 28 people week.... per capita basis, still hasn’t. appears changing, given strong flow traffic southeast Florida gets northeast, Florida really good job. claim northeasterners didn’t play role, that’s asinine. New Yorkers, example, travel extremely disproportionately Palm Beach, Broward, Dade counties. counties FAR expansive outbreaks. USA? may able get Everclear shipped you. hope guys get paid well Yeah, delay big story here. Texas missing 1000s cases totals day? incoming results backdated, included present day totals? think would less stupid people world based shit do, nope. Dunno tell bud. said link one overrun hospital did. Check mate. would still one less ICU bed available. fuck can't people sign online get scheduled? Sitting around waiting sounds like good way spread more. Muricans thought lockdowns infringed rights dine? Forget health. want food! Well yeah. Social security going fix itself, now? Yup.

I often find common sense extreme position lately. Alot people ready buy especially low interest rates right now. Sellers rush sell. “There new wording terms of, individuals intensive-level care,” Rivkees said, noting hospitals located COVID-19 wards within intensive-care units reporting COVID-19 patients ICU patients. “So make sure giving us numbers individuals intensive-care units, it’s individuals intensive-care unit care.” 

Rivkees Florida Surgeon General. Basically he's saying hospitals putting people ICU's need there.

That's interesting claim, hopefully he's making political purposes.

Assuming true, would hospitals this? thought ICU beds limited expensive resources. would put someone need there? Money, perhaps, i.e. bill insurance more? running non-ICU beds? take easy health care field I’d recommend contacting general practitioner asking give thorough physical including X-ray. may even prescribed inhaler damaged lungs. It’s always best get checked safe side. don’t insurance I’d check state see receive free insurance. health importance. Also, many protesting younger likely asymptomatic. concerned ramp numbers like Southern California early 80’s. correct, money would put us much higher tests much earlier meant for. deadly disease less transmissible. Need hosts spread. Hence Ebola dying out. Here's simple exercise. US death records can't manipulated.

Just give excess deaths FL Jun 2020 compared Jun 2019. I'm willing attribute excess death COVID. given data yet attempting take high-ground science. litany short-sightedness, greed, unwilling-ness change ones mind face overwhelming evidence, possibly corruption &amp; straight stupidity. chapter chapter tell story many different states. might end tedious. Edit: spelling ""decreased use face mask social distancing"" really general explanation though. Especially face masks theoretically mandatory California. Texas isn't? population density? people responsible? Im warning stop spreading false information China told to. get political literal asshole know much what's going Vermont  Floridaman Floridas Florida Walmart Church assuming you’re aware major church outbreaks Louisiana California since early days. Doesn’t take much. town question OP referencing struggles obesity diabetes. 

The fats disproportionately represented death toll virus. dumb, it?! confirms said? wording horrendously misleading 

“The process easing lockdown started May 10 Johnson detailed several stages steps UK's coronavirus plan – detailed 60-page plan” 

- announced 10th, measures come force till 13th article goes say.. next sentence. 

“Also June 1, schools England started reopen. Pupils nurseries, reception, year one year six able start returning date. Outdoor markets car showrooms also allowed reopen England.”

- exactly said, car show rooms markets.. non essential shops 15th.  That's relevant here. Try keep up. funny friend who's finance manager SoCal Benz dealer said thing. Manufacturers stopped sending new cars people come expecting outrageous deals reality dealership rush sell inventory. initially upvoted comment learned funds specifically contact tracing testing. research virus would totally side, meant used try contain spread much possible exponentially lot less possible April. Yes, lots running BC plates.

Lots US plates too. huge amount one ways canadians repatriating US, given US plated vehicles order come back here. yeah think would assumed point hey unprecedented. mean easing lockdown? lockdown introduced 23rd March. Cool. difficulty finding anything stronger wine right now. I'm waiting list local package store. article somewhere thought...eh whatever opened shop open.

I know listen Joe Rogan wants move open comedy store cause essential business. Thinks Texas right thing. 

Lt. gov Dan Patrick said Elders willing sacrifice themselves. 

All shit happening Abbott's watch. yeah dude Well, there's also fact high vapor pressure, meaning dealing lot volatile vapor that's flammable easy breathe in. course 2,000 two days according Houston health authorities. Memorial Day month ago. recent spike unusual likely that. keep getting rest eternity? What’s point vaccine then? We’re doomed! Tables socially distanced.

So fine? Large droplet spread it? end mask nonsense stand steps back. majority people getting aged around 35. know three people put house market April/May. got offers asking first day two. plan selling mine three years. Tempted put market rent. comment really struck home me. Going eat probably number one “hobby” pre-pandemic. I’m reading ton, completed bunch home improvement projects way money blowing restaurants. 

I’ll still go eat it’s safe, it’s going way less frequent used be, happy shaken routine. Thinking everyone know moved Florida, 100% accurate. great uncle 70ish moved mom died last year. college friend moved there, he’s suicidal... ended hospital month attempt. coworker planning moving friend retires. know man.

I want die life long health consequences.

But way US handling reality really concerning me. like want give world power status, also future way life.

I miss old world. liked able traveling world. went Italy last year. dreamed going Iceland Japan future. Possibly Argentina too.

I struggling operate world. ya Ya I’m shocked. OB weekend bad, it’s almost pandemic wasn’t happening, felt like another Saturday. yes! organizers best get us socially distance (as best crowd 20,000 plus). Handing free masks hand sanitizer. Took every precaution could, far tell fine well, that’s average covid deaths. Lombardi one oldest populations Italy, break mortality number age, said still applies. know mean. 3 October. One postponed. Another seems like it’s full good go. idea 3rd. we're going see deaths.

That’s going happen matter what. death unavoidable? Every first world country figured out. weird one .It's people like convinced there's nothing do, fuck Ugh. Thanks. sharpest scalpel abortion clinic. thing could said owning gun. slowed supply side banks hesitant give loans. let die People care. Almost one wears masks. People hug blow spit speak. wearing masks they're pulled absolutely worthless.

Unless lockdowns enforced we're trouble.  Lmao sentiment represents whole sub. Bunch life doomers think weird go out. take eat. Tables socially distanced. area 100% workers wearing masks. Vermont older population spread apparently stupid.  kinda place. fun spreading covid coworkers, customers family, elderly parents, kids watching suffer possibly die? end homeless anyways bc cant work cant go back knows long! infuriates stupid nation is. spell either way - yeah, local slang moron. fully agree, serious real trade-off needed considered. nation, US obviously done coherent manner. late, piecemeal, half-baked shutdown, bend curve much parts world, forced make impossible decision opening killing people, versus keeping things closed hurting people's livelihoods, mention issues mask social distancing compliance enforcement. really good options when/if infections accelerate again.


People running country right listen science react time, paying price. preventable. firms dumped supply back March start seeing foreclosures market soon.

Already seeing Denver, flood coming soon people bought cheap start unloading. none anything stated. masks work eating sitdown restaurants? I'd say 50% restaurants servers even wearing masks.

People done this. never apologize control machines me. going different Rutgers-developed saliva test? almost though lift lockdown put place prevent HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS spreading, virus SPREADS. 

Why logic stop door nimrods. tornado headed way, would sit keep watching TV? friend lives said reopening one wearing masks, enforcement masks. General population likes believe viruses magically go away. kid used look around see adults think, wow, must amazing grown know much, smart answers...
Now see herd stupid zombified people driven needs desires created powerful, take advantage them.
So, don’t lie kids think growing world think shielding right way go. need know dangerous world surrounded morons. Looks like 2 guys hazmat suits robbing grave. Employers let people work home governors enable them? Exposure time + sharing smaller indoor air space infected individual=new infections. 

When fuck U.S. gonna realize this? Even scientists still bleat hand washing surfaces, feces spewed toilets 2 active viral particles found. mean infective. active. person talking loudly phone stall next 20 times worse. stroke? idea let bunch people money extended amount time? sounds like would kill people virus. learned scamdemic. Apparently people pissing silly ""coincidence"" entering three digits Google followed ""new cases"" apparently fact articles come proof whole thing staged. 

I mean. Clicking couple articles convinces written bots. two, people know math works. 

Buuuuuut people spend much energy spreading misinformation fighting thing finally put fucking mask socially distance, they're energy shit. 

I'm tired stupid fucks. I'd like Click remote fast forward 2040 something. 

Yes, I'm tired pandemic continuing responsible. I'm sick tired virus politicized conspiracy nuts flinging bullshit around casting doubt. mean publicly funded schools? keep living ascetic, isolated life even longer. idiots. 104 cases, 76 (73%) asymptomatic, 41 (54%) lung opacities CT. 28 (27%) cases symptomatic, 22 (79%) abnormal CT asymptomatic cases COVID-19 pneumonia admitted hospital Jan 1, 2020 Feb 23, 2020 enrolled. patients history exposure SARS-CoV-2. admission, patients symptoms laboratory findings normal. predominant feature CT findings cohort ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) mostly involving one two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied characteristic 139 patients COVID-19 hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) asymptomatic. chest CT radiographic findings analyzed.

England lucky enough ruler come virus thus take seriously. Interdasting Oh wow.

How's going?? Trump needs killed. hope. makes think otherwise enthusiasm sharing virus. Telling young people won’t hurt bad messaging. Especially Americans.

The reason virus projections keep jumping entirely human behavior, tell extremely unpredictable year. big bad thing happens next accumulation factors. Like dominos.

For example say Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident consequence extreme weather phenomenon due climate change. It’s pretty tenuous chain without climate change upping stakes random weather event subsequent nuclear disaster would happened way. result many random things happening exposing failure system.

What happened Minneapolis manifestation domino effect. Floyd killed Memorial Day. recovered coronavirus. Things don’t happen vacuum. enemy zombie movies never zombies underlying racial social tensions exposed heightened stakes.

If follow drift, happens next also accumulative event, like ball rolling downhill. say giant pink elephant room world economy, don’t see opening closing even matters cannot towed speed.

Anyway really hope young people getting virus means less deaths doesn’t make sense me. quote guy singing high praises him. quote someone doesn’t mean think they’re good person. started never talking anyone who’s done something bad, couldn’t talk anyone. Must family reunion/wedding something Ok China meant intelligent lockdown? Sorry ignorance, follow lockdown procedures countries closely mine. people take 3/10 days antibiotics ""I feel sick anymore"" back doc office complaining month? 

Do even ask question? course are. Thank you! Well indoor places dangerous places be. It’s certainly anywhere outside unless people literally spitting other. think you’re right. Ask away! guarantee revamp HVAC system grifter sold bunch sharper image air filters re-opening happened quickly. enough time assess phase re-opening impacting case numbers. point, things still shut concerts sporting events.

it's almost like feds said would aid state budgets, state opened everything immediately collect tax revenue again.  Sounds like nonsense cousin peddling hold birthday party 70 year old aunt. Mind you, rest aunts uncles invited they're around age. 

Needless say we're going birthday party desperately trying talk cousin it. time next Trump rally! that's still happening know say people going get new jobs real quick? Reading hard, know. 

Anyway proposing? Many restaurants going business anyway. That's works real world, kid. America bad unless WORST. annoying. /s. Trump US military created covid frame chinese... glass water. Thanks heads up!!! one ballot capability addressing concerns. Apparently kill mice.
Once human trials start know more.  Ha hahahah didn’t claim feb March. easily take higher ground since you’re one making assumptions manipulated data.

And bold ask something you. oh good throw face corona-deniers ""its testing!"" people ""***Dream City*** *Church, north Phoenix megachurch set host Donald Trump rally June 23, claims solved pandemic problem auditorium, making safe anyone wants attend.* ""

&amp;#x200B;

Dream ... Hahaha oh, God. Le sigh. I’ve lived 2.5 years didn’t really time go! I’m excited visit Maybe tell people wear masks? Murica! Well, that's problem ban cars lol tests relevant, important thing identify infected person, trace contacts, isolate all, monitor/support 14 days isolation. Every state teams contact tracers trackers place. Instead, politicians sold public notion testing going somehow magically solve problem. fact 30 40% tests accurate, even were, point? gotta get infected people. rest political BS people buying without thinking way through. real purpose enable governors open economy justify killing people so. Jesus protect him. They've getting like 9 new cases since 0 active cases closing churches buildings apply. relative overall population counts though? Driving distance New Orleans youve never been? prepared make drive lot often go. That's real 'intimate' family relationships happen outside urban areas Ha Yeah let’s get millions millions people new jobs real quick, it’s hard since everywhere hiring right now, right?

That isn’t works real world buddy. bad theres spray kill stupidity. Suuuuuuuuure  /s explain 75% drop deaths despite essentially change new cases past 2 months last weeks spike

Saying “deaths come, give 2 weeks” we’ve heard since late April

I think we’ve turned corner medical therapy able protect elderly, tbh Could good news makes Trump look good? We've discontinued workplace. effective airline asks control bag.

1) going know 100 degree F fever.

2) multiple symptoms aside fever could indicated infection. people smart enough recognize without asking every time come work, got bigger problems. That's one conspicuous pair closet cases. Might help know BEGAN. fucking FUCK U.S. clamping specific sources outbreaks? 

Sneaking suspicion outbreaks occurring places work AC nobody wants say ain't beaches, hiking trails, protests, outdoor church service, theme parks, outdoor dining... office. Uh... indirectly kill people protests actual thing protesting about, maybe best idea. Texas +5112 cases???? Oh yeah! totally forgot ""Coronavirus-Killing Air System"". didnwe forget that, guys? thanks Trump doesn’t care America doesn’t either-he could eat babies air fans would figure good hates babies

I read back Nazis would try control perceived. mediocre architecture shitty movies day gets considered camps quality time would bully bribe cultural critics venerate them.

So creates culture base assumption Nazi aesthetics good without really looking critically.

I think true comes Trump’s fans. Yes, lot ignorant people America yes, Trump diehards never give don’t think base monolith think idea comes benefits bad faith people.

Just look rally past weekend, expecting 1 million people yet 6000 could bothered show up. months ago Iran let lot prisoners corona.

Kinda funny USA backwards compared Iran.  newtimes fake news “Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, *or prohibiting free exercise thereof*; abridging freedom speech, press; right people peaceably assemble, petition Government redress grievances.”

My comment way relates buildings. Honest question - possible Trump still virus free? honestly want know. Particularly dumb shit like going on... 🤷🏼 heard implanted hidden filters nose throat keep virus out. slurs, sniffles breathes funny time, can't drink sip two water time.  Americans still able get onto island somehow...  must fabled herd immunity. Fair enough. I'm believer trends think data national scale (higher positive % tests)is concerning. said expect we're going see deaths NYC level. Younger, healthier populations included positives, treatment protocols better outcomes. Masking common sense (and basic human decency), there's need panic. Experience plays huge role. Nurses Drs. putting long hours covid patients weeks weeks now. Lots communication works doesn't, people trying different treatments.

We also know virus helps optimize treatment. lot body mess lungs.  would really suck hospitalized Covid. think laid pretty well above.

Fox News one article. network supports suffering benefits party serve.

They support ICE detention camps. children raped. “Calm down, you’re going die.” - Joe Rogan Preach hospitals keeping 

I mean literally point lockdown masks, etc, ensure hospitals get whelmed happens fucked 

So good thing. also moved forced untold number people families land name big agra. want us cede union don’t associate hicks Alabama. Looks like they've got plenty hot air. California cross 5k new cases today. Haha, wishing cebrating harm/death (including covid-19) anyone! Trump doesn’t care 100,000 people die gets re-elected. sociopath. Maybe people shouldn’t protested then. don't. think mixture improper education obtain good pharyngeal sample wanting hurt patient. I'm South Texas right see Ontario plates time. Crossing supposed limited essential travel only, yeah works ways. guarantee states still lockdown downward trends open cases go again. realize catch/have one disease illness? USA countries. area poor citizens already infected disease.  smh makes terminator, goes back time accidentally leaves part behind near Al Gore recreate internet. Quick send link Rogan keep people panicking masks nearly impossible find. fuck masks, 98% survival rate need mask... sick wear mask go back normal life. RIP America 36.5% deaths, truly important figure. surprising all. Huntington Beach protests SIP happened early May knew spike going happen. Harris County, Houston located, started requiring masks (in [a roundabout patrons businesses Monday. whatever mitigating effect likely take least week show hospitalization numbers. could entirely preventable predictable disaster making. Imagine F1 Australian GP given green light. would much worse. Yes request feel like people knew 9-11 going happen would go twin towers show nothing bad could happen question protests, nothing it, reddit, never question protesters / rioters / looters, Musk, Besoz, Sweden CCP.

Thank did. Fact came said wear mask healthcare professionals face face people COVID would mask Jeff Sally closet full work home. Remember people panic bought toilet paper? Unfortunately live area lot ignorant black people harass wearing mask. city impeach Newsom protests every day since masks got rerequired. Okay, points:

* suggesting multi-generational home easy, even feasible people. fact, half first wrote listing reasons simply economically realistic desperately depressing majority families. simply pointed none reasons anything life expectancy, changed today multi-generational homes commonplace.
 
* level care demented elder require varies wildly. Many forms dementia relatively mild thus require exceptional care. Would able provide round-the-clock care someone grip late-stage Alzheimer's? Probably not, could, certainly manage long. family would desperately need avail outside assistance, hence third point austerity crippling people's ability multi-generational home.

* Alternately, know factually care mild sundowner. families probably could, (even minor) economic burden another dependent - people close financial brink able handle that. Hence first point wealth inequality.

* Regarding reality sharing home parents adult, clue anyone could romanticize environment - sitcom best. Also, siblings, big part me. Cruise ships common knowledge for... quite while... dumb question. mask job could contaminated.  put mine place outside parts get direct sunlight, hours trick.  thats posible light misting 70% alcohol solution sterilize (dont soak make sure alcohol enough time evaporate wearing could end breathing fumes). Crap! forgot mask



Bitch whad u thinking I'm batman😎 Australia NEVER required masks - pkay. think people politicize everything. said BLM contribute spread COVID19, imply BLM wrong I'm GOP fan. I'm stating fact. people criticize GOP politicize wearing mask, hypocritically can't accept fact crowded protest also negative impact pandemic, difference people mocking at. support BLM, can't cover truth bad timing it. past statistics shown African Americans higher rate infection death rate due average accessibility medical service, protest put larger danger. said care them, rather opposite. Honestly man move knew would understand ridiculous calling racist last response I'm giving rude person like you. took virus half serious would understand reason whatsoever putting thousands ppl shoulder shoulder pandemic involving highly contagious virus right move, ask person expertise viruses. irony whole thing lives protesting matter..you putting risk loved ones loved ones on. can't even believe I'm living world could called racist someone knows nothing simply saying agree protesting racism maybe PANDEMIC? Honestly? matter protest ppl taking part right I'd exact opinion..not well highly contagious virus spreading know nothing about. never even given moment time judgmental ignorant person guess I'm one ppl like personally attacked saying something makes complete sense. Hi friend! Thanks going unless to. I'm retail worker Houston recently given option either go back work lose unemployment. went back I'm seeing exact thing. Entirely people wearing masks, people going look, general air nobody actually caring ridiculing people take seriously. Today bit better masks required fear much damage already done wanton stupidity. unfortunate people take seriously got bad (a statement I'm afraid true months today). said enough masks go around general public hospital staff. 

They transparent though. Really ? really ? Facebook google non cencor still using shit “FrEe dOm SpEcheE” ? literally millions think masks work USA. Everyone family uses fabric washable kind still act like protect us. Still going necessary, wearing mask, try touch things much possible, never touch face out, wash hands soon get home. mother drove farmers market said one wearing masks everyone super close like concern turned car around left. study embarrassment science statistics. literally exact opposite want conduct experiment. Instead testing hypothesis, designed experiment give result wanted. held together evidence thin two year old could tell something wrong ""findings"". Fauci said mask unnecessary even supposed wisest country giving misinformation. disaster.  He's lost support. shit mask mask, sake avoid touching face touching things public spaces. Proximity cost transportation provided counter force manufacturing overseas, software limited things. 

A huge amount Zoom's software development outsourced China, support point. saying does, saying USA gov definitely ability wanted it. don't, sucks Americans since get negative distopian shit none positives(like using data save lives). Truthfully mask public large supposed wear protect others rather protecting themselves. everyone wears masks virus spread contained. make law public company, unless confirmed treatment / vaccine talk might one day. suspect news pushed stockholders. big difference something safe, cheap, easy (wearing masks), wearing lead jackets everywhere. Failure establish efficacy supposed move realm of, ""maybe works,"" to, ""maybe doesn't.""

Exactly, supposed start ""wear mask want to, unknown whether help,"" — ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus"" Whoa, really? Wooow. genuis thought bright idea. would've fucking guessed? mean, think idea? Whoda thought? Whoda figured? thought come from? smart person bright individual. can't believe wooooah. keep hearing stuff like this, yet hospital logs dont reflect claims. odd. I’m assisted living business saw people posting anti mask stuff nut job Orange County. shocked see crap orbit senior care professionals. joined FB group see what’s up. Holy shit! It’s surreal. flagship mantra masks bad, deny Covid say it’s flu, oppose social distancing, oppose testing, deny asymptomatic transmission, fully could care less anyone else themselves. It’s health decision! old people dying see. It’s growing brigade ignorance that’s going cause problems. next anti-Vaxxers. Covid disappeared tomorrow, aren’t going away. morph something else. Oh Karens love Trump. Yeah, I'm wholly unsure would trust US point :) Yeah would considered medical condition Better shit freedom speech ? I’m sure it’s me. LA go out, Latinos frequent masks on. What’s going on? It’s odd Fourth According worldometers, Arizona's per capita testing rate like 30x Indonesia's now? cases soon sent away Cuba begin infecting Cubans get sick disease. I’m waiting “/s” 😬 Covidfefeaid doesn’t matter dad told wearing mask dangerous Covid get CO2 poisoning. turned politics Believe want terrified I’ll somehow get sick get mom sick. everything open expect know got it, could anywhere? Dont hospitals get masks directly suppliers, rather regular stores? Dont suppliers prioritize hospitals regular stores? Totally clears President. Thank you! science mask wearing woefully underdeveloped recently gotten attention deserved. still uncertainty efficacy different situations. mask wearing never recommended before? influenza circulating decades. would interesting better understand mask wearing historically discouraged least recommended. India exactly shiny example rational behaviour here. put everyone strict national quarantine 4 hours notice.

Meanwhile look Colombia example also required masks acted rational enough give everyone 4 days heads prepare imposing quarantine. Yup. r/Masks4All Almost 100k tests today. need scientific finding facts, guess! someone rural area, met anyone thinks hoax. Dunno live Berlin loads people refuse wear masks 170-200 million uninfected would probably give 30k day... Depends talking death RATE deaths. Title says deaths, death rates. Same. I’m Sacramento area (heavy Asian population). grocery store February saw tour taking place hosted Chinese Grocers town sort grocer conference. Anyway, saw wearing masks. Earlier day first learned new weird pneumonia like virus China. Needless say feared worst, eyes open serious whole thing would become. guess could say “ah hah!” moment. also irritated would allow group conference tourists epicenter new virus country let alone grocery store. immediately looked getting masks family. But..but..but.. Joe Rogan says cool! article specifically states rate increasing due increased testing only. it’s true though. Taiwan, specifically, trying bring sharia law rural Kentucky, aren’t gonna stand it. confusing since different kind masks. normal fabric masks (cheap, easy use, help preventing spreading virus big effect epidemiological level) respirator masks (expensive, harder use, prevents mask wearer getting sick, mainly used medical professionals). 

So time people say told ""leave masks medical professionals"" think talking respirator masks realizing it. [Saint Antony patron saint motorists. 

Antony lived 300AD famous going desert live solitude. biographer, Athanasius, writes that, desert, devil tempted Antony ""boredom visions women."" 

Athanasius patron saint jokes write themselves. Yet Texas it... constitutes ’recovery’ though, subsequent negative test, showing hospital 2 weeks positive test? consistently calculated across country? remember basically ""the mask much protect *you*"", start.

Looking around bus though, mask seem incredibly difficult wear correctly. sacrifice doctors nurses, rather telling people stay fuck home don’t enough PPE incompetent administration? 

How delusional you? rude anything.
But anybody gives many hoots it. always thought spread enemies refuse meet other. breakthrough! Give officials raise now! USA still national policy mask public :/ Maybe take break Reddit? really mean kind way. Let people come across first time spread it. helpful information, stifle you’re tired seeing it? original COVID-19 epicenter US flattened curve. people regimes

This racist ignorant get guess. notion state governed primarily skin colour actually even something like post-racism since even early racial theories 1800's made difference various people one might call ""white"" days. China unbelievably low death numbers. Keyword unbelievable, choosing example headline ""seems shit"" bizarre say least. Will* have*


FTFY “Though billed protest, atmosphere Seriously. virus politicized. Mods nothing value trying sweep rug. #WEAR.THE.MASK. news, water wet. headline (haven’t read study): massively biased! Huge “risk” overestimate effect masks since country’s requiring population wear mask likely also strict policies (eg social distancing). (NB I’m saying mask useless shouldn’t used) amazing diverse California is. SF here, times went out, pretty much 95% people wearing sort mask. news, sky blue today get morons nose exposed. Pretty anyone see know absolute moron trusted /s Source studies spreading via AC? /s Remember reduced antibodies mean protection. wrote makes lot sense. focus short term gains killing is. Nah, Houston lots ICU beds, several large hospitals Texas medical Center.  towns around houston able handle surge patients. apartment complex doesnt enforce masks, despite ca mandate. also full dumbshit adults allow kids play together outside w regard masks social distancing. direct example leading example lead shit kids going affected, either covid directly, short/long term impact parents. parallels society whole horrendously uncanny. 
 
at point, super easy say fk anti-sciencers, 8-yo kids whos lives going seriously negatively impacted unacceptable. failure 100% leadership. fk trump fk everyone turning masks social distancing political agenda. That’s like saying sex hoax type “[key word] pr0n” porno pop keyword Given deep respective governors drawn line sand lockdowns, it’s probably going take 1 million deaths would change minds publicly. come 2022, Texas vote guy right back office despite failures pandemic. Texan, disappoints much guy “leader.”  Abstract


The unprecedented scale CovID-19 disaster define public health failure generations come. causes include inadequate funding, hostility towards science general public health science particular, government culture steeped deception misinformation, disdain collaboration greater good among community nations. consequences devastating, essential public health community uses moment spotlight promote agenda science-based policy, honesty transparency communication, international cooperation advance common good humanity. Ha yeah right. would risk angering orange mutant Washington that. Honestly, point, general public accountable themselves, might well let guys continue look like incompetent assholes are. root next election cycle, better. safety people prioritized since beginning, that's going magically change Check comments thread censored mods. Many pointing censorship enforced equitably good faith adherence rules. Would nice position like, something /s *Everything* negative fucking conspiracy people. Stop catering idiocy treat like morons are. quarantine. yoga pants beg differ tho :( I've dog, like gamier, tastier pork.

It fact delicious, Lewis Clark onto something. think we're pretty much [this DJT presidency. don’t think events independent. don’t think anywhere hit 25% without major behavioral changes including strict lockdowns individuals isolating taking seriously. don’t think there’s anything special, certainly there’s herd immunity effect, 25% seroprevalence. everyone themselves. literally know that. one possibility evidence claims. spreading outright misinformation. one literally called HOSPITALIZATION. click scroll give day day hospitalizations. ChaChing! spend money, congress alot more.

When/if evidence exists support claim, change viewpoint. there's going another $25billion every 3 months (for next 2 years), agree makes sense spend $25billion every 3 isn’t issue here.

In absence evidence support claim, issue. vaccine...it’s always gonna spike. I'm sorry, say? looking spelling PREGNENT, PREGNINT, PREGANANT, PREKNENT, wtf! church trust god keep parishioners safe? True. want videos coming Houston, Pheonex, Miami near future. is.

TW: anguish fellow human Yes, happens test Absolutely, that’s factor too.

The death rate significantly dropping 8 weeks though, positive test rate mostly flat. That’s likely nothing demographic skewing younger. said ""Great Recession"", Great Depression."" Unemployment insurance even extend years years Great Depression. 

Population exploded much last 10 years. stop mitigation measures, thing causes decline aren’t enough susceptible people propagate virus. become basis controversial poorly understood term “herd immunity“ becoming widespread popular press.

 coronavirus, probably happens 80 90% seroprevalence. state like Texas, would see around 24 million cases best available guess IFR maybe 200,000 deaths state decline. 

 course didn’t happen New York many places took seriously started mitigation measures. we’re going see tremendous amount people dying create one big gigantic “I told so” governors opened can’t ignore. yet death rate fallen cliff. friend recovered 0 symptoms all, felt 100%. Okay I'm done idiot asshole. outdoors conscious effort wear masks social distance - I’d agree didn’t contribute significantly.

Considering protests “right” wear masks follow social distances guidelines “freedoms” - I’d argue nowhere near BLM protests.

You move goalpost much want it’s going change answer. sources say likely vaccine 2021, really know getting 4-10 years. fact, there's entire episode called Coronavirus Explained Netflix, watch time. studies say keeping kids school prevented Covid spreading. (Hint: can’t)

I feel like even respond this, understand kids school falls shut downs quarantining right? studies show precautions slowed spread covid fact include school shut downs, even mention specifically. spend money, congress alot more. isn’t issue here. issue Trump intentionally slowing testing, inevitably slowing rate funds spent. Yes. One literally fucking called “Hospital COVID-like influenza-like Illness surveillance” separates each. click covid one, literally shows increase hospitalizations state Errr quite... I'm Seattle masks required. go little possible, feel like 70 percent compliance masks overall. That's experience, anyways. figured places would even worse compliance. Yeah businesses unable work profitable occupancy dangerous too, know happens??? People lose jobs, families starve ... I'm telling way hell Trump avoids catching thing.

And dies direct result stupidity go History single greatest example poetic justice. something works doesn’t mean always answer...

Do think fire extinguishers don’t work bc can’t change flat tire? stopped. would sub hate paper? care hungry children? suspect European countries seeing cases early November French army attended military games Wuhan October. 

It suspected countries closer proximity China see exponential growth early they're quite familiar China operates epidemic, closed borders took appropriate measures early on. rest world less aware. 

By time reached global emergency countries well beyond taking precautionary measures reacting based information cases had. 

Some got lucky able shut time spread catastrophic. not. really want hear, ""they assassinated him! Covid conspiracy assassinate Trump""

It'll probably end violent dies Covid office general. Well sneakily 4.7k cases Saturday tho initially reported 3.5k quietly update totals DOH without fanfare. Hospitalizations Arizona Texas, deaths likely follow deaths lag confirmed cases 2-3 weeks   That’s I’ve seen ability to. 

Pairs (or presumably groups 3) get placed one aisle together. Singles get moved elsewhere middle seat vacant. course, load factor 85% (15% seats vacant)...

This directive needs Federal level, like smoking regulations aboard aircraft. 

Source: work airport. people understand difference confirmed cases real number cases. 

Stopping testing doesn’t stop spread infection. Same. Sometimes think: let problem take care itself. know terrible, people ridiculously wearing mask know else think. Yes bad. Canadians suck. fact, suck much highly recommend keep border closed rest year. Seriously, don’t want us around def don’t wanna come here. answer question.

Do think resources available testing tracing December well? Shhhhsh see little circles labeled? tried clicking them?  would bet takes build critical mass exponential growth takes off. 

 It’s reported virus spread super spreaders. theory late fall it’s easy enough fly Wuhan major city world, may take 10, 50, 100+ cases (who knows) one place enough super spreaders entrenched able propagate super spreaders. get exponential growth like nyc eventually burns self (with help social distancing).  Well that's usa retarded af comes masks shows I'm placing bar there... made assumption me. Hence previous statement assuming know anything told thoughts. could run food bank would clue. Still amazed man contracted COVID point well im sure virus take warnings seriously Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic particularly severe older adults. objective identify, international literature, common symptoms met older adults infected SARS-CoV-2 virus. systematic review literature conducted using MEDLINE December 1, 2019 April 13, 2020. analysis methodological quality used method dedicated case series case reports. 260 articles initially identified, two studies finally included qualitative analysis. mean age relatively low, 71 74 years average. symptoms COVID-19 follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, lesser extent myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain finally vomiting.

Wuhan explode city organized mass pot luck, inviting local families share food. know anyone thought good idea city large crowded. heard TX NY started posting crazy numbers ""that never happen here, we're NY."" guess we're NY thought.  connection scientifically. know large crowds increase spread. large group shouting screaming, police also tear gassing people causing cough/touch face, virus spread faster things happening. support protests let's act like contributing increase cases protesting one black man getting killed. We're protesting history black men getting treated unfairly police, including deaths. least wash yo ass  👀

👄 “You call illegal immigrants. shouldn’t call illegals. latter demeaning implies lot former.”

That’s say. understand calling someone straight “illegal” harsh. didn’t think way. 


“If capacity feel sorry addiction” 

I don’t feel sorry self. I’m alcoholic lifestyle wasn’t sustainable. thanks reminding bud.  chest pain one first symptoms had? 

I’ve pointy chest pain since day two. point - dashboard easy manipulate. - know - listen people work hospitals know better dashboard. looking chief?? It’s literally called covid-like-Illness hospital surveillance dashboard clearly maps percentage covid- related hospital visits increasing. would bother digging site also shows ventilations along total ICU usage, that’s people crashing motorcycles nothing record breaking 2000+ daily new cases Arizona right?  think drink bleach. So, repubs protesting early ish pandemic, definitely contribute spread virus, saying, correct? way rally threat him. Judging brothers Instagram Fort Worth, summer parties usual. barhopping friends. Boating. Foam parties. mask sight. Placing bar literal starvation is, would say, touch :) lockdown California akin maybe 10% Wuhan lockdown  whole family Texas haha, it’s crazy there! would surprised DeSantis eats deserved crow.

Stay safe Houstonian here. avoid going public much possible, wear mask. times go, see little mask usage. never 50%. Old young folks alike. Can't fix stupid. think test much possible quickly possible. president believes opposite. national security risk? texas always brags going big..........there ya go. honestly biggest worry thing. it’s going kill us one big swoop, many left severely damaged thing? haven’t taken antibody test yet verify, whatever illness several months ago number me. noticeably reduced lung capacity. Things used easy aren’t anymore. best describe aging 30 years overnight. don’t know covid (the time frame doesn’t fit bc new year) hope people throwing around “not deadly” comments realize prolonged, slow death conferred upon relatively young person horrifying.  fuck cares. Shouldve never high first place.

Fuck off, deserve mad. Ethan’s TV tray protect unless getting regularly. evidence useful fight current infections. read ten Trumps campaign staffers caught Covid Tulsa Rally. many people must get sick Trump cancels death march? Doubt that. amount power thrown expect developed nations handle next spring ""He said elected lead, read."" work restaurant baffles many people come wearing mask take order me. Like would wear condom way sex take last second? use picture German football coach Florian Kohfeld? thing? 500,000 deaths due lockdown measures lol Think Denmark also kinda bungled through. contact tracing, still really besides half-hearted voluntary thing. testing people coming country, kind voluntary 14 days self-quarantine home. Testing really slow start up. Official communication less clear. masks anywhere.

I'm really sure makes difference. think missing elements picture. got Corona bonus economy shambles. Really best worlds.  /s Stand chance? Biden 9 points Trump right now. ""no touchy mask"" thing getting anything fingers touching orifice without washing pushing mask eyes. pretty much important anymore, use hand sanitizer afterwards I'm shopping touching things others might also touch.

I also wash mine sink. put wire stop fogging effect, get fucky jostling tumbling. 20s handwashing de-covids hands, 1 minute soap fabric line drying same. breaking cell protein. saying buzz cut socially acceptable cut man. There's nothing wrong woman wants I'd wages lot women would hesitant make change. wonder really *that* short? Antibodies coronaviruses seem last quite shorter viruses general. 

For example, looking this, found influenza antibodies, cases, last 90 years. comparison, previous coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV)' antibodies last around year (although rare cases lasted much longer).  Sure, ~3+ months much shorter year, compared difference year 90 years, seem strange. wish case buddy unfortunately pull hoax many ppl involved. think it..if wealthy powerful banking cartels ie Rothchilds/Rockefellers felt planet belonged saw form control financial system falling apart, people starting wake corrupt whole mess planet bursting seems overpopulation pollution would do? 

They use use wars gain power well also cull enough anymore. I've said years matter time real ppl power fake government dangle front us ppl pay put power decided enough enough. 

When realize virus either stays us re-emerges everytime immune falters catch body can't recover anymore maybe ppl finally start wondering virus seems strange yet perfect, effect babies, kills men woman, lives air surfaces longer should, kills higher amounts minorities on. Also oddness narcissistic men power friends like Donald Trump wear masks even attempt make effort avoid getting sick almost like nothing worry about? mean intelligent person knew get go masks absolutely made difference yet told wear almost like wanted spread fact ppl power seem nothing make decisions help spread.

I'd say virus seems little perfect want come someone eating bat stew. hey trust completely understand judgment come opinion..ppl love giving opions opions instead post mind I'm comfortable opions different opion I'm totally fine wont waste time like many others attacking your..own..personal..OPIONION that's what's made internet crappy everyone thinks everyone else think like better watch coming insult rude well so. would ask sort medical degree something back claims masks help. I'd rather listen scientists know what's rather random person street proof. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/eo5iZ) febreeze, maybe lysol spray it?  mean California actually one states large part increase due testing. positivity rate still pretty flat, rising states like AZ, FL, SC, etc. Someone bound gagged mentally ill abusive parents childhood may experience extreme distress something mouth like that. kind authorities too, believed crap. Nothing bad happened us luckily reasearch, worst part eating condescending words masks really help all. missed article success rooted oppression. UK numbers seem unrealistically low, honestly refuse believe every public place packed literally nobody wears mask, beaches full brim, buses full, shops, name Fucking duhhhhh want point countries mask wearing encouraged common, still done well. saying masks dont help, possible contain control without general mask wearing. people actually quarantined quarantine place, would par Europe right now. problem people didn't. leave job handle stress fighting customers Walmart refused respect 6ft apart rule, ""one person per self-checkout"" rule ""wear goddamn facemask"" rule. *March* people part understood seriousness covid. can't imagine going back now, numbers less stayed people longer seem think covid serious.

If people really want save economy, *need* start respecting lives. Issue one wants both.  went phase 2 Memorial Day. protests raise since minorities reported susceptible, lot people probably live mom dad since expensively expensive here.   care super rich athletes corporate sponsors get playtime participation medals? ""Governments wealthy countries went “whatever-it-takes” mode boost economies during the crisis""


Have United States? protects properly tightened (or used elastic cover). recall something like 30% compared 98% fitted N95. health officials say Americans shouldn’t wear face masks prevent coronavirus — 3 reasons wear pet theory looking possible. call egoist choose P100 mask protects piece clothe helping others choice become ill take P100. btw.: 3M forces outgoing air flow direction ground straight ahead face others, also helos others, except anyone laying around front me. course country prompt measures might never need compulsory masks. Eg New Zealand. get looks lot. someone said something responded back would actually fear dumbass self retaliate. Like couch spit near me. happened live. sure lady coughed guy covid police called.   That's smart ones trying escape dumb world die trying. That’s good, good luck getting everyone else stringent. Especially they’re unemployed feds don’t continue additional assistance. least protests outdoors nearly 100% mask usage. right. People keep saying ""That mask help!"". mean us wearing them, would significantly better wearing fat stupid fuck I'm assuming American.

The lack rioting government police completely dystopian fuckwits - actually manage get money people without work.

The civil war think might referring US created, US crowd-funded war drugs playing south. Again, reflection US government odds population.

As refugees, let's ignore US earlier hot-spot, presume talking people, who, well, how's wall going? Weird way saying it’s good thing China authoritarian ability fully crack citizens time... Meh whatever.   expects second wave? Sweden? think so. took it, works suppository form. What's crazy thought could avoid getting it.

You've clearly understood point lockdowns, dumb responsible.

The expectation always 90% country would get virus point, lockdowns reduce number people catch it.

A lot people followed lockdown measures seem understand that. weren't. made fun wife reason Yeah. prove another matter. However, wouldnt put past fully expect super secret semi illegal closed door meetings discussed. main issues calling genocide rest people comment thread seem think lots death=genocide isnt true definition. 

It could well attempted genocide, wont know way road get another Snowden. yet figured send people aluminum cans tin foil strapped rocket moon back. Fucking amazing think it. Spoiler... next year won’t happen Clearly. FaKe NeWs 🥴 It’s great did. Definitely got sense there. ... yes examples mentioned making mask less effective so.  It’s didn’t want people freak tf like food, leave masks medical staff. concerned healthcare system may enough PPE treat patients?
Then understand, matter opinion is. not, well discuss. But, $64,000 question is, could given public correct advice, use something like Defense Production Act similar authority restrict sale medical grade masks healthcare workers. Probably would take hearings find out.      
I'm also interested whether administration signed making representations. Wow I’m glad it’s going away summer heat Laws, yes. Save masks health professionals, anyone working patient facing profession wearing mask literally full blown moron killing everyone around needs downvoted ok yea, bad last call, y'all need wearing mask times pretty much anywhere anyone ~~working patient facing profession is~~ wearing mask literally full blown moron killing everyone around needs downvoted oblivion

Was amazing watching happen real time  work meat department grocery store checking Temperatures everyone working.

I 99 one day told go start working cooler come back temperature taken again...

I fever since then, guess covid.Of course, dont health insurance guess one life's great mysteries.

^^or whole town dead month cares, ya know. Closer 4x wave two estimate. I’m Wisconsin sister works nursing homes here. 40 homes known active cases. People need wearing masks everywhere hope even consider closing borders approved travel. Sorry pain caused everyone family :( lol cares point honestly, wear mask yet ppl around like gotta shop. die respecting elders, Trump elder I’m listening racist beluga whale. Thanks letting us know, says Russia China. usually wash clothes laundry detergent. guess could stick bar soap see happens 

/s Crazy prices. bought package 12 pair exchangable filters 50 USD back February, 2 days whole thing blew up. Pretty relaxing see panicked crowds rushing shops package way also 8 L denat. alc (96%) stored home. knew, known, true.

At time said that, CDC failed endorse masks spite data, even necessarily due lack data, existing data failed show masks helped general public. evidence based medicine, things supposed go. Failure establish efficacy supposed move realm of, ""maybe works,"" to, ""maybe doesn't."" time friend, Dr. Adams, said work, fewer 3 RCTs looking masks. basically show convincingly masks helped. 

To put another way, consider radiation damage. know block heavy metals like lead shirts wear getting dental Xrays. step say know radiation causes cancer radiation stopped lead, everyone wear suits lead everywhere. 

That example course begs thoughtful ask, ""what sunscreen?"" Indeed, there's like one RCT negative data. still recommend it? good RCTs seems plausible. also we've literally years talk it. Science moved pace never moved past. 

For masks, time Dr. Adams said did, 3 RCTs existed. authors one studies said data: good idea wear mask trick question, experts told me. actually need asking something altogether different. “**I would say there’s lack evidence support either position**,” said Benjamin Cowling, professor epidemiology biostatistics Hong Kong University. “When lack scientific evidence, use judgment might best thing what’s stake.”

Dr. Cowling fan masks since covid way, remained fan masks throughout. mask denier. 

This way science **supposed** work. think failure science understand science. 99% think Dr. Adams pants head stupid actually pants head level stupid themselves. There's rare 1% scientifically literate strong opinions way. 99% need bit humility. One wish, haha. Northern coastal states east coast act like hubs international travel, southern northern coastal states west coast. got hit early. What’s happening states got late seeing equivalent flash flood, stream everything seemed fine came pouring in. That's true. Europe, governments also said masks effective wear early on. changed mind. actually thinking read it. deaths one thing whole burden lay humanity hadnt known   good test, trace, isolate, need deal controlling mass contamination Tiny hands = tiny crowds Yes, fortunately. I'll tender covering mouth key ingredient stopping covid spread.

Noses dont typically project like mouths do, point downwards. ruby cause something like 10% cases, thats huge fuck lucky didnt cause more.

Other countries arent island.

Our tourism numbers already plummeted bushfires, lucky (in context virus, bushfires fucking horrible) know!!! Remember officials Japan insisting Olympics wouldn’t postponed? sunlight exposure good *some* sterilization. longer better. 5 times death rate NZ identical barriers. Hmm.... wonder happened there. People need shamed shitty stuff. Shame last saving grace civilization. double-lung transplant recipient decade knew masks (even homemade) best solution. I’ll never understand authorities everywhere didn’t ask lung transplant clinics advice prevent pulmonary viral infections. elders keepers knowledge, experience tradition

It's exact opposite China. early days pandemic, youngest generations acted fastest desperately tried get relatives wear masks. oldest generations refused wear one ""not big deal"" ""we went SARS fine without masks"". magic side. Never got chance experience second wave thing is... even know long herd immunity take? Yes goodness. Excellent info. I'm glad talking issue, bc needs front center. bet number go drastically everything that’s happening lately ship some? i'll pay. would guessed anti-vaxxer president able stop virus? Great. someone please tell Bill Gates shove immunity passports hole? video posted Sunday, Senior Pastor Luke Barnett Chief Operations Officer Brendon Zastrow announce happily church installed new air-purification system kills 99.9 percent coronavirus. **The technology, say, developed members church.**

This inspires zero confidence. Fair maybe wise. Wise hard earned. Turns country u.s. bombed well, look italy, Germany, Japan, Vietnam. Russia bad, UK bad. Maybe secret u.s. consider bombing solve problem think rational implication timeframe virus then. 5 days? 8 days? 2 weeks? Nope. Months. I'd bet every cent name actual contact - incubation - symptoms - illness - death recovery thing takes anything 1.5 3 months. 


Now virus actually slow burn, think would mean places supposedly ""beat"" virus. Thanos snap away miraculously time one place, simple case seeing results lockdowns mitigation efforts. personal theory 2 month lag true, we'll see spikes places like Italy, France, NY etc around end August. second wave, first one actually getting started lockdowns mitigation slowed initial spread.


I'm going debate anyone. place bets wait see roulette wheel stops. I'll see everyone November. like idea

Add slow pan shots plants performances im sold  Yeah completely changed that. I’ve returned work 3 weeks people stopped wearing masks week 2. work dental lab already tons masks stock closing shop quarantine. ones said anything wearing it. 

If anyone says shit tell kick rocks. impolite to. wearing mask way infringing upon aspect day day life, wanna give shit, told fuck off. 

“You know sheep wear socks, don’t anything muzzle foot. 

“Ok, so? care, leave alone, it’s freedom wear socks work want to. Quit baby something effect you.” That's hot take, considering numbers say opposite. mate. Yes, absolutely possible, perhaps something look back one day. something assume want ask ""Vaping disease"" pretty much dissapeared. much news around April 2019 USA. symptons damage lungs COVID Cool. agree BLM reason social distancing. I’d make comment underscores leadership so, important...but godawful mods would remove “political” 

Instead won’t say word either party, direct people. Let’s rely Big Brother save us one, one going save us. It’s us save I’d like believe we’re way, way better we’ve shown far states. this, feel like community compassion aiming right thing censorship needed ever right now. mean, we're waiting Donny something worse... think possible anymore. Countries forcing masks also established police state infrastructure place: see South Korea, China, Singapore. Amazing control population track force quarantine hotels literally destroying western civilization.

Are using literal definition literally here? civilization certainly problems, nowhere near destroyed, least using better word show respect humans.

I also find quite bit Orwellian we're separating undocumented immigrants children, we're locking cages losing occasionally. Yeah, point exactly remember comment unprofessional damaging. juvenile jerk Right? That's minor property damage. We've opened slowly SF Bay Area. Still haircuts county, definitely bars. wonder long severe symptoms would without media coverage Looks like normal day Long Beach me. Charles Darw-I mean friend Charles. Assclown. good page checking international numbers. right be. Showing world done! forget deaths severe cases ALWAYS lag behind.  video posted Sunday, Senior Pastor Luke Barnett Chief Operations Officer Brendon Zastrow announce happily church installed new air-purification system kills 99.9 percent coronavirus. **The technology, say, developed members church.**

This inspires zero confidence.  Poor planning white house? poor planning previous administrations allowed vital industries move China. Obama laughed idea bringing jobs back. Thanks answer, eh?

Why can't tell us ""final goal"" was? can't think rational outcome strategy involve ""herd immunity""?

I'll take lack answer proof know strategy always ""herd immunity"", matter much prefer admit it. ""What exactly grit?"" Chongching area delicious food. mention ridiculous requirements said unemployment. 5 work contacts per week, contact per week unemployment office, review scrutiny uploaded documents separate website. Zero contact *back* job opportunities. Sure! true changed recommendation whatever reason. proof masks power. Social distancing hygiene seem larger effect looking countries reopened safely without masks. health ministers lying since beginning pandemic credibility extremely low. wonder many people longer take seriously. still shit. Ok thx work much, though. People 1920s assumed average person would working 20 hour weeks technology would made us productive need grind away 40+ hrs produce enough everything... productivity, reduced working hours. work small office provides medical services customers/patients. staff followed rules day two (barely) thrown caution wind. I’ve kept wearing masks 100% time I’m building, clean every patient best enforce mask wearing side office, feels almost pointless people touching everything, passing things around, covering faces second leave area.Hell, even come area refusing wear masks walked back members staff. It’s small area often gets crowded due overbooking (something higher ups informed us weren’t going do) one seems care.

Going I’ve seen plenty people acting like over. news doesn’t surprise slightest. People don’t care think virus gone lack mainstream news coverage + mass openings. That's thing science: care whether believe not. 

Nowadays term often twisted ignorance anti-intellectualism, even compared belief-driven topics religion. people different views, choices, beliefs somehow change facts. gravity care whether believe not, everything falls same. would like see study that. nose designed stop sort shit enter body, mask smell everything around you, virus around probably smell too. mouth hand protections nose have, keeping mask nose mouth probably reduced spread significant way offers barrier delicate entrance It’s definitely best make assumptions people all. it, every need check ourselves. 

I’m huge fan AA saying applicable: 

“grant serenity accept things cannot change, 
courage change things can, wisdom know difference.”

We can’t control others don’t do, control reactions. there's AP news article China's coverup, moron ? know google ? Norway still required masks (except airlines), we've still breached 300 deaths. even mean indeed air systems use combination pressure filtration indeed lower likelihood spreading virus. nothing lower likelihood zero, especially sitting right next carrier.  [“Cloth face coverings may slow spread - CDC Let people come across first time 

Hehe, yeah - place reflected gives room one line thought. live literally right across river. entire Ohio River Valley hit huge wave (for us) morons heading Myrtle Beach slowing down.

Church gatherings helping either. Happy cake day. Maybe 30-50 think. Cases hardly rising. Ok. doesnt seem accurate me. really need explanation countries like Czechia, Slovakia etc. group countries USA, Brazil .... OK...maybe English first language missing point. ""Slow spread"", mean ""stop spread"". ""slow car"" ""stopped car"". far?

When said aim ""slow spread"", necessity also saying *not* trying ""stop spread"", instead expect keep spreading.

So, obvious outcome virus allowed keep spreading population? *obvious* outcome keeps spreading many people (or been) infected, enough susceptible people left virus keep spreading.

That point called ""herd immunity"".

Therefore, ""strategy"" aim stop spread, effect, ""herd immunity"" strategy. knew that, everyone else knew that. expect even know that.

It's neither you, they, wish admit it. Man really hope y'all stay safe there. I'm gonna heading school fall lmao Spain serological studies show 5,2% population passed virus. That's 2,350,000 cases IFR 1,2%. 1,7% count excess death country. Lol redditors saying word ""science"" actual argument itself.

You could put comment anywhere. science claimed masks recommended unless sick statement science one is?

Also there's whole thing correlation causation (which I'm saying play always worthy consideration) Nice hear, happy recovered, congrats! curiosity, feel recovering? still feel issues like many recovered patients reporting? ""Please talk without mouth condom on""

Yeah bareback feels much natural baby think that's evidence.  states may reopened recklessly, states ""right"" also seeing rises cases. big argument enforcing mask usage initial low supply masks along knowledge pretty sizeable chunk population use properly anyway.

So yeah, kinda understand people see viable solution time. Declare war  Yes also, even mess minor way still helping avoid asymptomatic transmission covid know.

I live Asia, certainly people follow rules strictly, mask wearing even without following rules still lowered community transmission rates. That's goal, personal protection. Science telling public masks weren’t effective months thing. Turn information around doubt people question legitimacy. also helps country doesn’t declare hoax begin with. spread anyone else? u get suck mom? 

This thing contagious , would gotten lot people sick. study? results clear start never said safe.  safer assholes going bars rallies. He’s 19. pleaded dangerous don’t want get anytime soon. kept replying knows without anything proactive. he’s sorry happened... LOL

I remember back February saying mask would effective. common fucking sense. right mask stops particles leaving entering respiratory system, wearing one helps.

Internet experts telling wrong was, understand know use mask. One claimed nurse doctor said they're completely ineffective COVID. justification COVID could enter eyes. said ""even true, mask block 2/3 entry points therefore worth it? called moron. 

Well well turntables. takeaway believe disease transmission occur someone protesting, can't rational conversation someone thinks way. Covid doesnt care crowd. could KKK rally/ Trump rally infections still work way. superspreader event.

And slightly worse one might initially think, people wear masks practice social distancing.  Possible, seems consensus real time sequencing studies showing mutations weakening it. Maybe new understanding comes later reverse conclusions. one thing studies seem correlated countries time appears less lethality reduction viral load. seems vary region opposed strain CV. human body change, presumably virus change meaningful way based current studies, could suggest viral load may key may behavior induced. Specifically, lower density virus air due masks, social distancing/reduced density indoors. 

There plenty early theories viral load linked mortality health care workers even public facing workers increased CFR vs general population demographics. one hand seems obvious seed 1,000 particles novel pathogen body produce worse outcome 10 particles exponential reproduction virus far behind 8 ball immune system time starts ramp fight back. shown viruses past exposing volunteers various quantities virus (flu, RV, nv, etc) generally higher exposure worse symptoms. 

On hand, CV conflicting studies viral load severity. One reasons could measuring viral load fact great indicator initial exposure body reacts. dosing people CV study emperically course.

New York would seem like good fit theory though CFR one highest would susceptible higher viral loads density. would need model demographics get better idea, surface looks like good fit. 

A counter point could places hit hard early trial error figure better treatment paths later hit regions benefited create better outcomes. Nothing concrete explain disparities though. 

Tldr; know lot Feb barely scratched surface terms concrete answer understanding physiology all. still best guesses. Ok, agree that. problem minority voters. Netherlands though case study without masks relatively deaths cases. 

I'm saying wear mask, believe good call advice people help make sure masks go right people needed them. put masks dashboard Florida sunlight use. opening early people aggressively joking big fucking deal, always seems folks *not taking shit seriously enough* ""happen"" suddenly, mysteriously, catch 'Rona. Lebenslang grün-weiß! faster country used common sense, fewer corinavirus deaths had: study needed! us saying back February/March basically told shut fuck up... oh well ! Nah. Upvote worry, Governor DeSantis made sure plenty Florida bars get infected at. Who'd thunk it.

Protective equipment protects.

Mind = blown.   observations agree. Latinos dont seem taking appropriate precautions, despite susceptible. I've also noticed couple Asian men wearing masks, decreasing. I'm sure cultural thing pride issue. worries me... Chào bạn Ohh, like agree logic. see. CREAM English 2nd language dumbass? profit system Yeah absolutely need source. Basic intuition understanding AC says wrong, air circulated conditioned, usually involving reducing humidity. Also many rooms return lines, meaning air conditioned pumped rooms. would also imply 6 foot rule total non sense. wot Yeah COVID amazing - completely immune long correct left-leaning politics! Endless funding militarized police war. 

Doctors rationing masks. 

It's become obvious America terminal decline. Ok get everyone else sick? question one asks answers. virus contagious, cant people really sick, would got lot people really sick Even ""no touching"" rules unnecessarily complicated unhelpful average cloth-mask-wearing person.

As well, numerous studies showing masks indeed lower chance flu infection (flu viral, like covid-19). studies years, even decades old. like suddenly popped months CDC claimed masks useless. 

Also keep hearing cause ""more harm good"". call bullshit too. interesting hypothesis even single study verified claim? pretty bold claim saying improper usage lower effectiveness also makes quantifiably worse wearing mask all? asked everyone provide evidence found none.

Really, sport different. Burn fuck imo New Zealand hand washing, well sickness etiquette general, pushed hard since February (being time started explode outside China). Can't tell many times heard radio several PSAs sneezing, hand washing, face touching, activities protect people around  That’s probably HIPAA, ADA. can't believe man actually said that. There's bar low him. People Making Fun Coronil Patanjali Medicine Related BJP Supporter + H!nduism + Ayurveda. 
If believe, atleast criticise unless proof. thing complex that: 
while masks neither protect wearer block someone infected spreading virus infected well people around wearing masks reduces risk significantly.

It's correct say masks helping medical standpoint - wrong look population-level Whether masks work 50/50. yes no. monkey pick one other. 

The hard work justifying it. That's science works. that's process understand. process admit can't explain 3 reddit comments less. someone uses lots fancy speech sure look smart me.

gonna lose sleep zinger. stage fear people mass hoarding masks absolute bullshit. buy masks everywhere even self made masks made two layers fabric effective. It’s time changed communication approach them. think Dutch exception whole world agreement - based scientific evidence - masks help slow spread virus? People adapt slowly they’d better change communication people board second wave comes. 

I understand communicated first, risky approach even back politicians government authorities always frowned upon changing stance. People dislike inconsistency, country anywhere. took *way* long find comment. Masks almost certainly help degree, anyone believing comments would think stops virus tracks. Correlation always mean causation perfect example that. making everyone wear masks (when simply may enough) one difficult implement least proven forms preventing it, countries gong far require taking plenty precautions too.

The concerning side false confidence risk-taking result kind misinformation. masks even half effective they're claimed here, precautions may well scrapped. Instead, precautions likely cause sort findings.  Wuhan even among top 5 populous city China contrary common belief, bat dish Hubei, like , never past 3,000 years.

I remember ever hidden me. Never thought we'd get point Chinese bots backed corner bullshit, they'd start screaming ""CIA BOTS DEMOCRACY FAKE TEAR AMERICA"" 
 
Nah, whole Chinese government evil they're systematically everything fuck planet, fuck people, fuck anyone tries stop them.  
 
The thing is, shout want ""CHINA GOOD AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FAKE LIES REEE"", get news sources countries, BBC news. I'm ""Hurrr fake news"" boat, I'm also gonna sit pretend like American news business vested interest solely selling what's going get higher ratings.

Hello,

On hand food amazing, sights great, people friendly speak English pretty well. go around island using excellent public transport everything pretty reasonable price. I'm bit skeptical, think ayurvedic medicine cure much anything, let alone coronavirus Yep, optional quite people wearing them; almost every person going supermarket (the place many went public duration) level 4 statistically significant.... mask filters 60% mask filters 60%, that’s combined 84%. statistically significant difference filtering 60% 84%. lets pretend ordinary walmart.

Can epidemiologist check this?  problem first glasses fog moved mask nose glasses top blocks moisture. love near impossible instructions disabled people though. can't follow instructions interfere medical care. handwashing see dirt handwashing Covid. thorough frequently, even see dirt. Wearing mask, rubbing unwashed, covid-infected hands eyes stop infection meant convey got it, know 80%. I'm implying everyone already infected. I'm really sure interpret last sentence, hopefully re-explanation valid. Cringe take. Self preservation king.

Lemme tell ya, person employed CIA torture uyghurs kidnapped American democracy Guantanamo. trying make look ""upvotes"", LMFAO!!!

Also, CIA bots usually do? one guy employed chinese government bad things, whole Chinese goevernment evil.

Similarly, kidnapping Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, soulless destruction Tibetan culture, degradation rights Hong Kong citizens, etc American democratic lies. everything told American democracy lie, mean things accuse China true Also sure keep eyes closed exhale taking mask putting mask back on... Amun’s things, like shaking mask, rubbing mask around face, touching face. 

When putting mask, re-touch mask, touch you’re mask, keep fingers applied done task remove use washed. touch face fingers touch mask. absolutely wear mask moment open front door get really dizzy minutes wearing it. take off, force take deeper breaths herculean effort never feels ""enough"". rarely go people around. need air, wait till 10:30 night walk secluded park take mask off.

Even wearing stinky old rag alone would effective fighting spread social distancing washing hands alone. 

I always thought stupid west worried washing hands keeping distance early stages, lot good would something control happens, like gust wind blowing crap face, situations become impractical enforce social distancing people eventually end crowding. know control? Wearing mask. 

People idiots, hell, even people back spanish flue knew cover breathing holes. efficiency N95 masks questioned though. accepted better medical personnel access encounter COVID-infected people. Surgical cloth masks protect people getting spit, virus. question whether enough masks people really needed them, whether masks effective all. see /s, th8ngs use clothes washing something dissolve fats Cases rising last 14 days, deaths continue drop. Weakening strain? We'll see next couple weeks. Commander Chief, I’m sure feels award medal three.

Cassandra? Yeah... “testing centers” CVS Walgreens can’t handle all... big guys like Banner Northwest can. people don’t realize though go “tent towns” get tested... sure don’t tell people. 

Sad part is... tests proving 70%ish false negatives... super sad. careful watch family closely... start struggle breathing all... go quick. COVid changes quickly. 

No worries downvotes... people don’t like others disagree them. Genetic mutations, strains virus Europe lethal, Overall, provides much clearer picture. Specific days skew overall trajectory/average.

Besides, grey line didn’t go red plateaud would ideal rapid first screening. assume deaths go weeks case virus weakening? guess depends young people getting infected. allergic backed cum position something it... immunity there's point vaccine, would give wait die covid. lolwut  feel that.

Lets go 3 vapid comments row! dad alcoholic? hard talk about? envious. never shut limit client visits absolutely necessary. Despite staged reopening coworkers seem think it’s total a-ok business usual. Tons people unnecessary person meetings, seem see masks huge inconvenience even clients, know whatever time. terrible social distancing entire time constantly trying like Pac-Man avoiding Donkey Kong. actually saw two cheer client wanted one wear mask meeting (the client elderly disabled) backed it.

Honestly would prefer work home continue started staged reopening - hide office, meet clients must - mask, clients wear too, treat coworkers like plague, go hand sanitizer like it’s water. 

I considered high risk healthy, active early 40-something, post viral fatigue sucked, suspicious another long viral illness caused current chronic thyroid issues (it linked), concerned potential lung damage health lifestyle, plus rescheduled surgery coming don’t want postpone (already happened due pandemic) sick. Viruses serious don’t know everyone still treats like “eh” am.

I essentially grown hate coworkers tremendously really shown little care others. didn’t open soon. didn’t utilize closed time effectively could open. 

We literally shut sat around thumbs behind government leadership perspective. I've learned medical field equal. long shot. point ""we're going die covid, let's give up"".

I mean, contagious virus there's immunity get time time time would end mankind strange damn virus history, immune system stupid would extint ages ago. amazing people safely cross street. state would fire Eddie Risponi great link appear going up, say.

Poor Jim, getting drug ground this. Actually pretty easy, making sure plastic blades go right parallel skull. mean seen information used context ""we noticed lots people get infected X closing X initiating new restrictions"". 15-20% people grocery store masks on, **a good number mask nose**, I'm sick hearing people say greatest country fucking give problems like this.

Ugh. triggers much. last paragraph:

“Experts particularly concerned risk prolonged fatigue, saying prompt treatment needed reduce risk long-term syndromes.”

And exactly would treatment be?? Thanks spammers, got phone set ring numbers contact list, stared contacts get ring business hours. one parents diabetes, another parent hypothyroid, little brother gastrointestinal disease, would smart fly visit them? live another state America. They've socially isolating almost 100%, still go work. wait rest year, hurts think I'll wait indefinitely vaccine comes distributed everyone. :( It’s interesting California many cases, yet little deaths. plainly obvious, could kill us we're already dead?

What would FEMA coffins then, huh? personally think they're even thinking virus. care many people get sick long economy keeps chugging along. Dan Patrick pretty much told us started talking elderly sacrificing economy. federal government shown going anything yes, wish people would part slow can't anything change government November. agree packed planes spread virus, I'm also tired hearing ""well breaking rules decided _____"". something breaking rules mean safe wise. case OP, everyone else also booked cheap flight budget airline months ago want cancel trip? airline do? Cancel tickets, let others go? terms carriage work situation like that? I'm sure OP expected, sounds like expected plane would empty could enjoy vacation pandemic others sit home. addition potentially getting coronavirus plane spreading it, OP could also get coronavirus many activities trip assume OP quarantining Florida Virginia upon return. yes, think maybe OP take personal responsibility realize safe travel vacation hotspots pandemic trip Florida wait. Maybe people that, need travel urgent reasons could socially distance planes. Trumpy enough empathy worried anyone himself. feel like country given up. government, sure, given VA home loan come! China. Racism others like blacks, whites, asians. like one country it. like countries it. That’s lack functioning brain cells comes Whats death rate again? makers ""Troll Physics"", bring ""Troll Health Science""! Hopefully hospital space.  I'm coach.

Just saying, ""people racist doctors,"" much less clear. understand? definitely feel closer daughter. rough spot month lockdown emerged stronger it. article lays wrong traces help people working Corona countries. World Food Program warned end 2020, additional 130 million people could face famine. fight global COVID-19 pandemic, borders closed lack local production led soaring prices countries. South Sudan, example, wheat prices increased 62% since February 2020. Difficult access food, related stress could lead food riots collective violence. God... course can.

} I'll say you, hope trump gets fucking dies Ryopus good news? okay?  people hear passionately speaking country people need part image. Faith, freedom love USA almost incestuous level basically blueprint getting elected certain parts place. Anyone using logic see fractured contentious country right now, though. Two weeks. deaths spike. 

Two weeks Memorial Day start see surge. Two weeks start see deaths.

If went back full lockdown, takes two weeks cases drop.  mean ""I nothing contribute"". China top 20 safest? Like damn commi government trying tell cant meth park naked. thought lived free country! Wake people! 160,000,000 rricans it, 50%?  fear Alabama well. one taking seriously number one county terms cases close town. Also, 80% capacity normal. opinion (and opinion take salt you) underestimating time infection death along. comes anecdotal cases plenty people weren’t even sick 16 days exposure, died less week afterwards. Also widespread belief virus existed Wuhan November. simple miscalculation “what known along” adds seven ten days infection timeline would account appears paradoxical outcomes.

Second, death rates along depended almost entirely availability medical interventions. American medical systems stressed areas country. willing bet survivability rate Atlanta peak much better survivability rate Albany Georgia peak.

So would make total death rate dependent pockets poor health care infected virus others. I’m willing bet looked things county county level would make perfect sense.

Personally think need start talking outcomes different ways. keep telling people NORMAL pneumonia last year wind ventilator still probably never fully recover lung capacity. It’s there. sick sooooo long. It’s good. Even didn’t die. There’s lot binary outcome disease.

Edit: also think primary (first) presenting symptom confusion disorientation. got sick last year first thing happened started feeling strange, probably due desaturation unnoticed damage lungs. known people verified COVID confirmed hallucinations blackouts. think number “asymptomatic” people may neurological symptoms. Also, hospitals typically run close capacity. test, exist. ;) 48 50 states never even got close overrun hospitals, doubtful change. 

48 50 states pretty well covid. New York New Jersy anything concerning them.

6 months California 40 million residents 5.5k deaths, slightly worse germany percapita almost 2x many deaths also 2x population they're considered amazing job Cali par even hundreds thousands maybe millions disobeying government orders. Texas 30 million 2k deaths. 

My state largely disregarded stay home orders still went beach public gatherings hundreds people 3k deaths 4 million. 

At point people going face numbers really are, mild best throughout majority country. I’m arguing you, still doesn’t make sense.

I’m pretty sure people won’t wear masks voluntarily wear clothes, drive right side road, file income tax, etc.

I could go on, see point. can’t reconcile strikes nerve many people considering everything else they’re compelled do. think California victim success. handled intial outbreak really well people probably thought safe go there. bring COVID back square one. one US dying starvation due covid say otherwise line touch. also stopped requiring masks public. list “essential” business included furniture stores... whole list nonessentials. Can’t wait see women forced remain pregnant decided abortions nonessential, deadly pandemic financial crises. 
I can’t wait gone. think could Wendy Davis. makes look like wuss 2 girls 2 covid


now girls dead.  right definition Orwellian double speak. seriously brainwashed cant see it? Illegally entering borders nation crime. Period. Mental gymnastics can’t change that. Maybe leave door house wide open let squatter come stay inside room free. That’s illegal right? 

Plenty LEGAL immigrants would agree one too! nice Cooper trying... South Carolina, governor nothing Texas...and no, mean anything...because ""muh freedumb""...

I, one, taken calling bars ""fuckwit zones"". full bar, ""fuckwit zone"". practice social distancing, masks required unless eating, gloves full use? give money....like Pluckers. See swore late February friend mine actually early March actually gotten test came back positive got antibody test last week negative. still think never get sick annoying dry cough. Love downvoted, ignorance astounding uR sTeP-vIRus!!?!? mad anthony fauci? man lied said didnt need masks? worry means care and/or half brain. know worried.

B) **something makes look weak** \- wearing mask something weak person confidence does, and

C) **wearing mask admission problem** \- refused admit gravity situation day 1 back form

Go ahead bud, wear mask maintain distance wherever possible. believe it. mean places spread unencombered now? everyone assumption people sub? get people pessimistic doomy, people still don’t want happen.

The fact you’re assuming want worst Arizona pretty fucking insulting. mean guy literally suggesting covid hospitalizations ARENT rising Arizona. fucking crazy? miss memo says one hospitalized virus? you’re getting 2000+ cases day there’s surprises hospitalizations increasing. It’s fucking absurd people suggesting otherwise

I’m also saying Arizona hospitals gonna fucking collapse, im simply laying irrefutable fact covid hospitalizations rising Arizona.

Are gonna tell despite state made basically changes behaviour, infections going go down? I’m stupid. think people hospitals ones critical condition. I’ll take L Sounds like win me. Since I've worked home instead crammed office, I've quit taking allergy medicine every day. imagine circulating there. I'm Ohio opposite. Even store employees wearing them. numbers going (positivity rate hovering 3.6%) beyond me. ""I think bullshit would called out"" point, it’s like let kill themselves.  thought germaphobe  hearing infection rate drops dramatically 25%? think totally incorrect.

What population even gotten 25% seen natural decrease infection rates 25%? Bergamo supposedly 57% rate antibodies, although study random. WSJ good source scientific facts.

But certainly seems vast majority cases caused indoor contacts.  outdoor. Even flu regularly number rural hospitals Maybe, miss sub china flu juicy science discussion, less politics.

You keep going back memorizing details like Pythagorean Theorem, I've stated that's what's important. What's important learning think. 

I'm ready throw towel schools like are, throwing towel conversation. Nah. We’re talking dumb conspiracy theorists violent wing nuts here, mental illness. Widespread masking already become common SARS outbreak. Everyone wears mask they're feeling sick symptom people wear masks public anyway. 

After announcement Wuhan, almost everyone started wearing masks immediately. Soon, government issued mandatory. 8 (I think) deaths, zero new cases months. Everything open running normally, except foreigners allowed without proper visas permits.

Source: live here. anti-intellectualism finest. I'm gonna username checks here...only D&amp;D player would chime this. want people hospital die? seems pretty simple. Yeah saw someone hurting dog front me, would sleep well prison. 

Don't come the, eat animals argument. is. important remember point, doctors learned lot treat virus. 'cure' even definitive treatment, seen enough cases larger cities know recognize seriously ill treatments likely help, 'proning' (turning patient abdomen help breathing), avoiding using ventilator nothing else working. information made widely available doctors throughout country (and world). Also, realization virus cause blood clotting issues, even young people may shown obvious symptoms COVID, means person presenting emergency room symptoms blood clot taken extremely seriously even younger age range, treatment started immediately. 

A rise cases may mean equal percentage rise deaths due factors, good thing. Even so, way know serious case die, take risk family. go out, wear masks, period. activities involving large crowds, eating restaurants (takeout fine precautions), like. worth it. downvote technically comments add discussion thus decreased visibility. duplicate comment like poster child appropriate use downvotes. I’m surprised comments positive scores, usually one positive one negative.  You’re right. I’d rather give quarter pay health insurance companies instead, ever get really sick, accumulated lifetime net worth lose job lose shitty coverage I’ve spent tens thousands for.  Late Summer start seeing them. takes long time stage 3 trials large numbers patients. want cut corners.  saw comment reddit they've stopped including pneamonia caused covid death statistics. time statistics death pneamonia multitudes higher. (500% increase something) honestly think protest going re-opening. re-opening kinda helped spread virus. Helicopter parents worst. They’re setting kids failure. Correction: doesn’t care ONE. Yes. insist upon projecting mania demand everyone decivilize pretending afraid. So, absolutely go -- since suggested it.

About half people see wearing masks. nobody practicing social distancing. curve goes up, store ( /r/bestbuy ) letting employees come back letting customers store. money never human life. want quit, might hard finding new job. hand, would making money unemployment, probably...

Nah... guys turned away ICU fills saying illegal immigrants inside getting free healthcare law discriminated against. Never. That’s conflicted this. Yes need open beds everyday hospital visit like things pointed out, hand people COVID wish, leave house “feeling better”, could spread virus much quicker opposed stuck hospital. people honest stay home treatment would miracle health care workers. Thanks sharing tidbits show, would watch could. That's worrisome statistic.

Pre covid job place that's generally considered ""dirty"" people get sweaty often clean use properly- gym, that's unclear. They're pushing open us asap ppe provided employees wear (or get fired) get sent home days, unpaid, even 1 symptom, members required wear mask.

We absolutely ridiculous standards policies ""keeping things clean people feeling safe"" really just... open yet. make cleaning rules intense maybe reopen. came back already regret it. Nearly half California’s cases Los Angeles county according worldmeter. Unfortunately doesn’t data new cases. mean ignoring whatever want make go away :o *surprised Pikachu* Sure. work twice hard half pay. they’re basically making recovery numbers up.

Of course, pulling state drivers, checkpoints makes sense (and maybe random, moving checkpoints increased patrols routes people use circumvent roadblock) would, theory, force people travel needlessly enforced zealously high penalties. wondering whether employed next month due slowdown business, risking $500-$1000+ fine weekend trip may appealing know 3 people got trouble something similar. Reduced business = state earning less taxes. Whether states start enforcing travel restrictions places hard-hit thinly veiled way recoup income via fines air, sure thought action crossed people's 4th amendment instead precedent drunk driver checkpoints extrapolated.

We saw debates back March stay-at-home becoming thing state-side. Hypothetically, things get really bad worse case scenario, could come act first, ask questions / deal court later situation.

EDIT: course, still air whether see travel restrictions future. thinking window long passed spread control. rule future could actually see consequences first-hand out-of-control spread. spared initially part, reality sinks in, things could change. wish dark comedy. I'll use Rust super safe. yes called internet.

but I'll ask full 14billion $___$ actually really sad. :( Around freaking chin noses out. smh. leaders said okay get group numbers thousands. long protesting! Lol we’re f**k’d explain! CDC set forth recommendations/guidelines/safety measures prevent spread Covid-19, included are, obviously, face masks. Additionally, CDC long since set forth recommendations/guidelines/safety measures successfully prevent measles, mumps rubella children. 

Though efficacy indisputably proven, face masks, like MMR vaccines, recommendations required law. Measles outbreaks covid resurgences happen people create guidelines regard others' lives impacted. Simply put, Zac de la Rocha said best: ""f*ck tell me!"" Yep. Auntie Pam bought potato salad, Uncle Sid bought wine, Auntie Karen bought horrible infectious disease. February schooled everyone masks infinitely complex things need commercial pilot license. get wrong die.  I'm confrontational honest open-minded curiosity whether advocating destruction society. advocating destruction society? sure worried Maybe free detriment? Yeah ventured brewpub weekend. looked great tables really far apart, system, employees wore masks one employee who's bringing us food sporting around chin. WTF? Good, good. sad thing is... might even stay home. wash up, social distance possible wear mask. 

But no! much ask! see countries far better numbers we're still riding first wave. Read history book find truly stupid species. I'm surprised shocking That’s fine let’s get real here:

The majority mask-wearing population doesn’t wear mask correctly. They’re also constantly touching adjusting mask, contaminating process.

People also depriving bodies necessary oxygen increasing CO2 intake, wearing masks prolonged period.

It’s one things seems logical reasonable paper stupid af real-world application. Still lot big lies going around masks. get past ""masks protect you, protect others"" lie yet? (Spoiler: protect others.) Next big lie: need surgical N95, ordinary cotton do. Sure, ok 30 times less effective. Otherwise need deserve protection health workers, there's enough go around. incompetent criminal leadership.  Better English, please! rest United States followed suit. There’s still certain demographic people refuse wear masks either think masks ineffective based infographics spread throughout social media don’t want considered “sheep”. hope flat tell behaviors dangerous everybody around reason intention seeing family urge family members stay away. gonna get people killed. got it! Reopening happened fast. went months phase 3 like next week. seems like chose $ lives haven’t heard this. What’s story? recently got MMR booster year ago measles outbreak near me. countries test people brought back form China discovered sign significant intentional underreporting? article tries equivocate statistical correlation causal relationship, false equivalency. Regardless masks indeed work not, article crap Australia ever recommended wearing masks we've 102 deaths. New cases single digits recently eased restrictions bit we're still getting 15 cases community transmission day. . POTUS killing US citizens.

So ""Americans"" R U dumb ignorant?

We're capitalistic society, kids becoming millionaires opportunities internet, people need provide families. So, lot educated individuals would rather go private-sectors (or) public businesses.

It's pretty known standard government institutions laggin' behind counterparts; computers could still using Windows 7 internet explorer (ain't even joking personal experience).

But, tend quite humble ""boring"" lol. many employees would capable enough run real-time studies incorporate proper sampling sturdy research design. pretty good idea how. can't see second wave would *worse*. Despite global daily cases increasing, daily death rate almost half April. Regardless vaccine created, virus getting less lethal day knowledge increases new treatments developed. 

This get Sweden's approach. Even wave Covid-19 cases inevitable, save thousands lives delaying long possible. virus less lethal, also use extra time ramp contact tracing, testing, treatment capabilities. eat drink situation need mask

My son's school planning open hybrid plan fall (some in-person, online). lunch? 6+ hours straight. handle eating/drinking? 

I'm guessing expert, I'm necessarily asking *you* much universe. work? People like toss around fear phrases love denigrate prepared calling afraid. I'm afraid least well-prepared take appropriate precautions. Apprehensive? Sure, I'm used abnormal. going jump airplane never seen parachute, understand worked, would afraid. training, understood process equipment, would nervous, apprehensive, would afraid. That's caused considerable spike cases anywhere else world dont. feels like poorly written article shit headline? disagree? People blaming protests, right causes increase since county (in oregon) stopped shutdown didnt start mandatory mask wearing cases doubled last month. 0 cases. agree- whole “Asian elder” thing plays whole exotic people Orient stereotype. 

I think better way frame argument individualism versus collectivism. Individualistic countries like U.S. prioritize needs individual. Collectivist cultures like East Asia prioritize needs group. Collectivist cultures much receptive policies designed protect group, like self-quarantining wearing masks, expense personal freedoms. Americans whole- not. 

Also- People East Asian countries wearing masks sick LONG COVID polite thing cold flu. Americans poking fun didn’t understand context. changed minds based studies. 
That's science works man, want ""right"" 100% time go pray good health someone dies say ""insert god name here"" 's will. best part, muricans turned wearing masks political statements.

They type wear shoes indoors, I’m pretty sure turn washing hands political statement. care. took time come online commented. Thanks contributing. What, true disease.

Many people time encouraging people wear masks. trying look 'moderate'. Hawaii well. :( 4 cases today, hope keep single digits... :( China’s turn help Central market today, saw everyone masks except one family. way mom looking around, could tell felt judged. dad walking tall like IDGAF. Kevin ooooh drama * touch mask hands unless putting removing it

 .. ..

* touch mask putting on, wash hands take far, far week see masks do. still upcoming spike coming 2nd 3rd week July 2nd 3rd level transmissions protests, likely, July 4th comes end July August... top curve on.

Did know numbers see reported running two weeks behind? beyond mess. honestly think officially control. take another 7-10 days leadership admit it, IMO. Harris county first announce new orders, think counties Houston choice after. Trust me, hope I’m wrong. I’ve worried I’m seeing since January. 

If sort control, numbers would hold steady begin drop. increasing rapidly day = exponential growth. Last place see US NYC. worked far fogging glasses adding wire nose. masks originally wire, sow one in. used ribbon, inch wide, sew top end parts top mask. Make sure seer ends lighter shred. use pipe cleaner whatever wire slip in. Works great, found youtube btw. Hope helps. mostly N95 masks health officials didn’t want common public snatching health professionals would need them.

Furthermore, article super outdated advice coming Covid spreading US. ONE 1:1 case. Threats mass spread via crowds stupidly radar.

The experts say masks good community, it’s least could do. :) Someone thinks knows Damn. someone settle Doug male Karen? really liked Doug Funny though. Darn. RemindMe! 6 weeks 4 months late thanks. Mmmm....no. I’m saying it’s bad news. telling truth, they'd spreading tech whole world keep end pandemic tracks. mental gymnastics get there. correlation actually countries developed health system gets mask I'll admit heard, believed, spread told masks February. figured CDC one federal agency even Trump hollow head idiots...sigh. Low test = low results = open economy Florida declaring WWE essential business back Mid April think keep Giraffe reflex hammer (from linked tweet).

Best luck thanks keeping us updated. Looks like got scientist necessarily cause / effect situation. counties likely adopted social distancing early much better testing / contact tracing early. US slacked horribly fronts.

Plenty countries masks aren’t weren’t widely adopted done pretty well. California smart, reasonable, slow think. People found loopholes entire way went hell late May protests, holidays, parties, etc. Testing sufficient counties, all. awhile, could get tested without symptoms LA County, restricted since times filling locations closing. Neighboring Orange County never able test *symptomatic* people. Contact tracing insufficient places met extreme resistance others.

Fauci took responsibility aspect explained away lie. Theres zero evidence trump pressured inappropriately way. Fauci never advocated everyone mask idea somehow trumps fault grown ass man made decision joke. 

You act everyone administration pushover- true. People actively contest disagree trump. Please quit propagating unjustified lie provide incendiary hate trump. 

There nothing supporting *hunch* fauci spineless pushover whatever trump *pressures* do. 

It Couldnt possibly fact new infectious disease sweeping across globe creating global pandemic causing lot doctors public officials make questionable suggestions decisions. Nope, idea much sensical. /s Thanks sherlocks :D half year wow Getting moon hardly makes country great. seeds everything horrible country beginning. competent person would interpreted approach virus viewed wrong population guy defends himself.. Food scientists flip floppers. answer question protest less deaths too! Wow great science! fuck grandma, right? Let furious. furious. everything protect put lazy family members think exceptional virus give pass. behavior going catch every one want part it. Indestructible! click bait That's weird considering NZ never required wear Same. feel incredibly lucky liberal parents. Especially white person, considering many white friends conservative parents. true. However, countries didn’t take severe precautions (SERIOUS lockdown), masks least way curb spread. didn’t anything try beat it... live, hospitalization rates keep going up, consider reliable indicator real state affairs rate positive cases. Also heat would kill it. Coming trope heard around early going. mid-June, it’s hitting 100+ since mid May. think early lack cases plus feeling would go away summer lead remarkable complacency that’s rapidly biting us ass. lied, saying 'it's okay *he* liked because...' far inside bubble see it. mean period religious people reject science learning? downplay importance data crunching, ""proves""? Come on... I've said many times. Trump handed re-election silver platter. step back let experts decide policy front man encouraging country take precautions we'll get this.

I know he's incapable things he's narcissistic incompetent right taking. nothing Dem could done win he'd handled crisis correctly. forcing large volumes potentially contaminated air hair, clothing, face, eyes. Yes, they're risk exposure, they'll accumulate far lower concentration viral particles. There's concept virology minimum infective dose describes statistical threshold concentration virus high enough likely take root propagate.

There's couple reasons (possibly more), take 1 virus:

* There's probability virus fails find suitable host cell successfully infect it.
* local immune response may capacity deal limited quantity infected cells. low enough number, may able fight infection faster spread. low, wonder country newspaper turn shit recently. country recently hold grudge reporter, even word ""Nhỏ không học, lớn lên làm nhà báo"" meaning ""lazy study youth, growup Reporter"". Maybe reason reporter country feel freedom (include freedom lied people find lied - act ike never happening except appear Facebook, t

RTS maybe worth mentioning tho, doesnt consider problem really come reporter themselve. Eat ur snake oil, makes u happy. Main point make spread virus place know it. really apart making sure covers mouth nose everything else rather irrelevant. Masks don’t prevent GETTING virus, they’re effective making sure don’t spread spittle though.

If wear mask crowd unmasked people, that’s useless. However, everyone wears mask crowd, virus spread severely contained. Hmm... Maybe safer assume ~75% population respiratory medical issue seriously traumatic mental issues preventing wearing anything faces sad see countries europe going attitude US Brazil.

Surgeon General, Fauci, CDC, etc. could easily given alternative guidelines face coverings DIY masks early explicitly stated there's shortage, manufactured masks desperately needed hospitals facilities time being. Instead, government doubled down, claimed shortage PPE fault own, blamed hospitals doctors wasting PPE, continued properly secure stock hospitals. free all, pretty messed looking back since apparent effective masks reducing rate transmission everyone wears one.   No. Ppl need smart. Theme parks going pretty rife though. Plenty close contact poor ventilation. asked, decided answer?  So, short, agree OP's article exactly truthful. Correct. one vaccine either, either let work society **in controlled manner** runs people without immunity, hunker maybe vaccine appears unspecified date. options profoundly suck.  didn’t report daily breakdowns, [just cases past 5

But people decided masks useless time supply chain properly caught up. :/ different rules black people.**

Decades racial progress... *erased.* don’t really ICU shipped coronavirus patients neighboring hospitals. you’re right, justification tried use lock world out. Sweden things went like normal.

No didn't. Stop spreading lies. China: told ya. Also Tokyo resident, I'm going disagree somewhat.

First, agree lot government response pretty bad. However, focus clusters seems merit.

More importantly, much masks might help, people wearing masks regularly Tokyo since long break, virus spread, ultimately virus kept spreading social distancing lock measures place.

Masks help, might correlate good practices, might single best defence article suggests. well thats called N95 N100 I'm part Japan less affected Covid(double-digit numbers prefecture), mask wearing big factor, suspect cancellation large events another. first large local event saw cancelled late February, festival estimated get 10,000 attendance. local marathon early March, lot smaller events started self-cancelling. around one two confirmed cases prefecture.

Masks main weapon fight virus. Wearing mask general easiest thing within person's control. Washing hands social distancing impractical guarentee enforcement, always wear mask keep wherever. Agreed, oversimplification seems likely countries mandated masks swiftly also countries took threat seriously start. I'm sure masks part positive outcome, attribute solely masks would oversimplifying it.

Correlation equal causation that. 14,821 cases 441 deaths. wearing mask mostly protect  others infection, washing hands protects yourself. Unless eyes ears also covered mask. several boxes industrial N95 &amp; N99 masks tried give local hospitals. refused industrial. kept box us use reuse handed rest neighborhood elderly, single moms, essential workers.

It’s common fucking sense face covered decrease chances becoming infected. wtf? also disagree. could trust one another talking right now. percentage infected UK Sweden. Sweden achieve anything intentional strategy incompetence achieve UK, countries still expect second wave winter. Today records least number new cases since beginning RMCO last early June. Today also records least number recoveries since CMCO last May. 254 new cases since last 14 days, 289 active cases. one main reasons recovered cases begin drop Germany well, definitely felt like dumbass weeks repeating government bullet points ""masks protect infecting others"".

If masks effective, would doctors health workers even wear first place? 

Why would China's government make citizens wear them? 

According friends working health care, March real shortages masks German hospitals, kinda understand best political course action global misinformation campaign. 

Still sucks left feeling naive.. 

 yeah, particularly US still seem struggle concept wearing masks now... software jobs ... think indian market ? Speediest! Funny! It’s also lot easier convince universal mask rule countries, already wear masks cold flu season. Hell, even summer abroad Japan, wore mask sinuses acting up, wouldn’t constantly sneezing people. live Japan? often not, Japanese people want hands going bathroom.. sprinkle finger tips water give appearance washing hands. appearance here, coincidentally many people wear masks...so show making effort. idiotic take? 

Surface transmission massive problem. 
People cough, sneeze, touch lips/eyes/nose etc constantly, touch hand rail door handle droplets sit next three days. next person comes along they’re carrying around without even realising. Washing hands properly serves help prevent spread every surface stops infecting happen rub nose once. 


Breathing alone isn’t direct route, distancing issues would way worse. 
Coughing/sneezing releasing liquid droplets direct route social distancing alone largely protects from. mask extra precaution physically helps people touching mouths/nose incidentally.

I'm sitting unemployment wondering gone law school like mother told me. It’s basically patriot act kindness. fair, Taiwan population 23 million (\~7.5% US), theory it'll take whopping *80 million* investment capacity produce enough masks everyone US 10 masks every 14 days (heh). 

With aggressive contact tracing early focus masks, Taiwan actually never went lockdown. Large gatherings banned, companies elected work home, tourism industries hit hard, large economic life went fairly normally. island helped course, Taiwan mostly focused securing border rather enforcing specific rules within island.

Sorry, rant bit. say I'm discouraged American people understatement. Somebody corrected someone used english definition asymptomatic correctly. cannot correct someone using term correctly. give fuck whether there's another definition word confuses everyone. Im upstate, already plan homeschooling. dont feel comfortable sending little ones, mention Im immunocompromised husband eventually go back work trying eliminate many exposures. feel you. Stay safe :) Utah Hispanics make 14% population, 43% cases, lowest mortality rate. Bad time forced work, great time young. totally following you, yeah MI seems going well (although another stay home extension)?

Considering horrific early death rates, it’s great turnaround. Washington denizen claim Yakima Today read scorching article written Gen Z millennials act, made feel old lol even though 90% would consider gen x boomer traits (like saying “happy hump day!l”) Genius Orange County female health director also. Also, Whitmer done GREAT job Michigan, read headline saying Michigan really turned corner much better. Yw. think people knew could sick months, would cautious. understand people object wearing mask inside public place. That's excellent point. FL gonna drink red corona kool aid 😔 Yep. Seems common rule I'd expect rock climbing form climbing really. Man! sure milking hoax/conspiracy thing hilt. I've never part conspiracy. I'm kind excited. Yup Exactly... people feel cause important virus doesn’t change virus real. was/is worry Memorial Day would generally family friends cookouts... compared large protest would much easier contact trace. large outdoor soccer event people cheering screaming thought major event linked massive outbreak Italy... didn’t even know virus. simply money bring important life.

San Francisco full year's worth suicides April. lockdown costing lives know populations higher risk virus, maybe need protect vulnerable populations get rest us back normal. virus behaves differently ships ships different. Wtf even Sure, spreads easily ships.

Good sorted out. quite journey. Would require constitutional amendment.  certain human certain place definitely crime Sometimes. posting Michigan's recovery starting blasted people reckless. emphasis mask wearing bizarre. almost feels like victim blaming.

For reference, live one largest cities Canada, numbers improved drastically. Yet, mask usership something like 40% less?

The issue businesses reopening, people packing restaurants can. Shit still shut here, even though tiny fraction cases US per capita.

People gonna do, close damn stores provide opportunity! Provide economic benefits encourage/allow people stay home!

Blaming people getting sick pandemic incredibly insincere, hate that's somehow become narrative Reddit. people's fault wearing masks, damn Tr*mp supporters ruining shit.

It's not. government deciding screw you, tricking blaming other. I’m cusp too, baby boomer Gen X. identify Gen X especially hate boomers get. forecasting less intensity fall/winter? pretty close white supremacist, educated realize it. Q anoner That's good point. feel like Canada good comparison point far general lifestyle cities concerned. Definitely similar US European metros. yet guys solid leadership, messaging safety nets. think compelled government anything bad wrong evil

I see *any* people protesting recent curfews.

They get loud masks actually affected therefore invested actually care, means actually need feel compelled anything, want. care getting people pay attention them. Keep mind 0.25% New York City already dead. still scary Thanks, seriously.
I'm safe away disease. live country quite fine. hope go away, want life plans work out. Anyway, thanks... Much much love times confusion hatred... article says traced case H&amp;M store protests aren’t believed related transmission Victoria. makes sense: masks + outdoors makes virus really hard transmit, matter close together protestors are. Oh god.

This could be... extremely awful. reason Gretchen Whitmer got hanged effigy.

It’s racism, lots people still enjoy hating women.

And they’re health directors too, it’s full “burn witch” time. people keep traveling ny, schools crap open up. root problem clear. government's official response disease. case pro administration area less serious take problem. Title doesn’t mention 12 states America. Crazy think long going take end. Yes unlike maskers crying freedom, restricting interstate travel ACTUALLY constitution. first written, states regulating interstate commerce caused big mess new constitution actually forbid states restricting commerce states. Shutting travel state state would go well Supreme Court. wanted case emergencies like this, you’d likely need new amendment. tell protected amendment right, like guns, fight wear masks. Good. would really helpful studies follow positive antibody (test cases), never went hospital see health doing. Total game changer mild case, non-hospitalized even asymptotic cases permanent damage leading future complications quality life degradation. 

What dont like article personal cases statistical study. 

Of course horrific none less virus severe stats death, hospitalization, etc rate would lot less meaningful 'unaffected' cases long term effects/damage, statistically significant manner. Bruh, really trolling post? looked data United States Average Class Size:

Elementary School: 21.6 
Middle School: 25.5 
High School: 24.2 

You went school larger average class sizes. Much way say something racist, poster call racist.

Hit dog gonna holler though. Florida surge COVID-19 cases since Memorial Day could set Houston area track peak 2,000 daily hospitalizations mid-July, according model Baylor College Medicine epidemiologist. taking seriously got it. Sure might helped perspective already lockdown time ambitious testing targets got it. think bits news reddit made seem like abandonment herd immunity happened time BJ getting gap weeks can't compare Denmark USA though lol. 5 million people compared 330 million. state alone, Ohio, double population. many western companies people China now. still think China closed country. disagree. way many people feeling big brother answer guiding us well, reality shows they’ve guiding us absolute shit. We’re better this, want believe big brother? start giving much better response opposed incompetence crisis   massive cycling rally world health day. that, seem self censor. much else, unfortunately, however probably lots cases there. apparently bought restrictions? don’t know. Or, laptop. Ah, ok test less many cases.

Anyone brain could predicted spike. one advocating could go either way. Sure, comet could destroy life, virus included. make realistic scenario.

1) Take measures
2) virus spikes
3) surprised pikachu face! surgical masks, efffectiveness greatly increased use nose pin. oh without trust government required work... without universal heath care... without cinnamon buns meatballs Well sun fewer hours people indoors evening, holiday gatherings bring travelers, school session. walked back even demonstrated make mask tshirt months ago. recently said mask symbol freedom allow Americans get homes. stupendously wrong also willing change position. standard work though geolocation rather *contact tracing* estimating bluetooth connection strength that, distance.

It us much better privacy preservation data interpreted contact useful, e.g. bluetooth connections blocked walls lucky, GNSS might register position 40cm apart even though leaning opposite sides wall. regard virus' first transmission country, several possibilities discussed. ""For example, virus may remained imported frozen foods, mutate due frozen environment throughout entire storage transportation period, overseas way China,"" Zhang also possible virus may lurking dark, humid environments, properly disinfected sterilized, exposed local residents, causing slow evolution.

Droplets airborne viral particles float air bit eventually wind ground. Everyone seated lower level risk, especially rows/tiers directly behind overhead. Trump dead center crowd. Bad upper level droplets concentration airborne virus. Meanwhile, masks thing Denmark. think I've seen 4 5 people masks city 50k+ people. weird. believe every study see, especially one pushing group think shaming compliance.  Meanwhile News: Hot water discovered mean things hospitals years works. Imagine that. shocked. /s Please don’t post articles alter title. rules here. You’re editorializing. Basically means competent government is, lower coronavirus death had. Countries required masks also things combat spread virus. county California, low active case 100. Since reopening, 300 active cases. saying since March it’s June going July. Give couple year. masks bad you. /s 1300+ votes commented. 

Bots? Swedish correct long run deaths even necessarily COVID-19 prefer die rather later sooner. thought general idea medical science postpone inevitable hard imagine choose so. Well, game yet. Thank pointing out. Also unknown numbers compromised populations elderly underlining conditions cause death rates go up. Comparing death rate fruitless since many variables people die different reasons.

Also every country good data management system. numbers statistics could off, assumed based analysis. 200 beds away normal ICU Max capacity (TMC hospitals)
This look good all.  CDC recommend people well wear face mask **to protect themselves** respiratory diseases, including coronavirus

The statement correct. use facemasks never protecting catching virus. LMAO I’m Taiwan don’t domestic cases coronavirus 2 months.

masks production secured February make sure enough supply domestic needs required public transportations form April. agree - going Tulsa supporting Trump mutually exclusive. make number excuses go nothing Corona. 

These people feast cognitive dissonance day long forget next day. What's little white lje going rally, cause afraid Corona timing belt car sound good last night/home schooling test tomorrow/stomach ache/back work cause time cause hoax corona, can't take Tulsa get time get in, see people camped out?! Etc etc. Etc.

That said, think low attendance psychological effect supporters might little fence. quite simply fucking exhausting believe lot called supporters feel way admit it. It'd easier even Biden next four years. lol state like 5,000 cumulative cases knowledge workers aren’t expected return 2021. Belgium long time said masks primarily help worn sick. Someone who's sick wear mask, important. mind people mask sick I'm staying hell away them. Trust me, guy a, stranglehold customers. People flock buy ""Indian"" ""Westernmade"" contain ""chemicals"" Pride mask Spike! Surging! Soaring! Skyrocketing! Blasting moon! Earth shattering record number cases. Lol memedia  He's going get reelected Except Western Australia. closed everything early. Wash hands, stay 1.5m apart, stay home, also got quarantined 2 weeks entered state. 9 deaths, back nearly fully open 3 active cases hotels quarantine. reversed. supposed touch hands usually far dirtiest part body. touch mask, transferring everything hands mask. Yea pretty much; expect something like corona all. I'll Uppsala university there. chest pain isn’t always associated pneumonia, it? don’t cough yet, throat starting hurt slightly. needed mandate masks. done May, Texas would largely avoided surge. is, likely case little, late. China desk. Top 10 deaths per capita, yeah, much issue.  CDC well Social distancing still effective even though elderly population hospice hit particularly hard compared neighbors. Well， lie obvious tell good general public , meanwhile highly beneficial essential medical workers. like 4 years old elder brother told buffalo wing good health give instead. absolutely do. It’s HIPAA protected call. must confirm needing talk continue. confirm it’s inform possibly exposed person tested positive coronavirus. tell was. Again. Privacy. 

The goal ask quarantine 14 days help achieve that. check regularly see things going case start showing signs. 

If become case gonna procedures based illness progression. real answer this: large variety different types central air systems. fixed operate others lot ability control adjust things like volume air per minute per cubic foot occupied space, % fresh air mixed stale air recirculated, efficiency filtration, etc. massive oversimplification, case obvious. 

Every single building different risk levels, every building manager different grasp problems different valuation ""covid safety vs. building heating cooling efficiency.""

If want good rough proxy ""how fresh building's air"" get CO2 meter measure carbon dioxide levels. extremely accurate way gauging ""heavily breathed recirculated"" indoor air is. Obviously want indoor air high percentage fresh outdoor air possible.

Outdoors air around 410. Proactive building managers strive keep CO2 levels 1000. 2500 range start getting uncomfortable feeling stuffy. may get headachy, drowsy, irritable. 5,000 general workplace exposure limit. *dangerous* maybe ten times that. 

Long story short: want know fresh used indoor air is, get CO2 meter go there. fucked big time, course gets hired administration. surprise there. guess correct analysis. soon read mask vs mask could make 100 times saved lives comparing countries could tell article little connection real world. 

There likely positive effect wearing masks, especially indoors close contact (nursing homes) scientific evidence low quality. else go golfing Currently seems second wave mainly avoided making first one last forever Good news appears majority problems arise significant cases. Finland took seriously (and still doesn't) require masks. Sweden arguably take seriously refused go mandatory lockdown, see results.

It's also interesting /r/coronavirus sure science works know correct this, part reason masks still recommended Finland solid science show masks work. studies (new studies, mind you, since pretty much nothing start pandemic) show work others show work. clear cut many seem think. Lemmings slaughter !! profit people jolly good mmmm say man United States. whole place cesspool. mask talking, coughing, sneezing. remove done wearing it

I picturing one wildly wet sneezes going mask spread face. :D Fun times! Dumb idiots also true, Niderlander mostly act responsible adults time Covid pandemic.

Which quite rarer across big pond, esp among followers GOP Igolf Twittler :( clubs (AZ, course) opened last month. thought they'd least stage - nope, VIP dances go. requiring anyone wear masks either. managers BEGGING girls come work shit talking (vast majority of) girls stayed hunkered down.

Most cities one county enacted mask mandates now. girls working losing shit, trying figure circumvent rules. like feed stereotype strippers dumb, kind earning title. 

There ZERO reason clubs open. good amount club owners buildings, landlord trying collect rent give excuse. greed, pure simple. 

Fuck petri dishes. may forced push retiring good... Proper journalism right Man don’t think much. data messed up. predicted Florida early state hit hard reopening far nothing even much higher expected number people going back work/ mask. uptick hospitalization uptick death. Lock flatten curve sure ppl adamant closing everything down. *Face-palming* Florida Man Arizona Man: two sides bozo coin. I'm convinced mask wearing single biggest reason isn't.

Because is. notable difference social contact western eastern world. difference half world wearing masks pandemic. And, really, reason half world cases deaths. basically LA county though. mean LA county huge, still 1/4 CA's population remove LA county, CA looking pretty good. Depends mask type, cases keep i.e. clean lunch box perfectly fine reuse. props never get experience it. know, can't spread virus virus, right? SG Adams correct, wearing mask's makes ""feel good"" thing, legit studies show face coverings, ski masks, homemade masks etc..are anything stop spread covid 19. Mask shaming hobby ""Karen's' world. better, care, evil. Grocery stores forbid bringing cloth bags, filled germs. like dirty masks. IMHO simple, yet large proportion people wearing masks even close wearing properly.. Looking around people wearing masks, understand people advising use masks public. they’re screening fevers. Ok. Symptom. Singular. tell people wear cloth masks like countries instead Saying masks work. that’s Sweden tried do. Danish Prime minister literally said made decisions without scientific basis.

There idea beginning people would touch face contaminate mask. However suspect lack supplies real reason lack masking recommendations. suddenly infections going issue kind faded background. People stuck distance requirements. news, water wet. thnx link! Handfull? 17 million people country IQ average take avarage people Netherlands everybody gets education. Still max amount viewers watches press conferences covid 7 million. means 10 million people care still dumb enough watch it. believe know watched even people knew concerned football canceled. hand full. 

We old TV presentor anti covid YouTube channel facemasks lockdowns 5g 40 real deaths far. crazy. viewers national news. hand full. 

I work mall. Nobody, nobody zero people anything rules. 1.5 distance stickers door get fine that's it. police anything mall never did. people working sick bosses want positive covid test go home. Even though government rule high temperature, entire family stay home. 

Schools care teachers parents mix match schoolyard drawn lines already starting fade. 

And protests. Specially USA. mean rest world got news days ago USA officially gave war covid bevause riots nobody giving shit. USA 20 times worse country following rules. 

The funny thing though is....nothing happens. people say. doesn't. 
I family pharma tell ready set go September time people get colds spread virus caughing unlike now. see. made china, wan ones manufactured korea, Chinese ones specifically manufactured sell Americans. simple

A, B, C still true, know lot virus now. shift mask recommendations many covid 19 cases asymptomatic show minimal symptoms, number demographics like 30%. means many people general public asymptomatic infectious. Masks prevent others getting sick you, important people wear mask, people? know antibody testing established effective, everyone wears mask anyone could asymptomatic infectious.

Governments dropped ball mask guidelines, big time, mistake costs thousands lives lot money, blame people believing government medical guidelines. Nothing decisions regarding masks scientific. know, really nice feeling affected change behaviors. rest country could get onboard... stay f tri state, peachy.

I remember too... two half months ago feels like age. Early advised general public wear masks A. Masks prevent others getting sick B. People got sick isolated C. Priority given elderly, ill healthcare D. know anything virus people. 

A, B, C still true, know lot virus now. shift mask recommendations many covid 19 cases asymptomatic show minimal symptoms, number demographics like 30%. means many people general public asymptomatic infectious. Masks prevent others getting sick you, important people wear mask, people? know antibody testing established effective, everyone wears mask anyone could asymptomatic infectious. I'd like see study repeated year ""deaths norm"" counted instead comparing countries everybody died basically coronadeath (belgium) places nobody died corona (russia)

Still, really masks? countries required masks also limited movement, social distancing rules, limited flights country etc etc. Hmm yes floor made floor Next news sky blue realize recommendation wear masks *based science*, right? Seriously, pop Google Scholar search papers 2020 containing ""surgical mask virus"", marvel conflicting results. studies show either benefit *worse* outcomes mask wear.

The US (and particularly Trump administration) completely botched pandemic response, mask issue really clear, *even experts subject*. still lot unanswered questions. rundown uncertainty:

-There over-estimation risk face touching, under-estimation risk aerosols.

-It clear initial viral load correlated severity.

-It clear masks fit tested, may block 80% viral particles best, would use.

-It known viruses would tend shed mask long-term wear, would stay adhered static attraction.

-It known duration wear would negate effectiveness.

-It known people would strain harder breathe, potentially drawing particles deeper lungs. (This issue people use masks polluted areas, realizing mask chose effective certain particle sizes.)

-It known people would wash/change masks frequently.

-It known people would get false sense security.

-It known easily virus spread, fatality rate 0.5% 3%, thus risky false sense security could be.

Consensus seems forming masks effective, foolish pretend obvious along. reason cut Trump supporting acquaintances life: they're plague bearers well idiots. look towards US

What mean that? Agreed! 

Next comment? 😂 Trump campaign constantly sued non payment. expensive mistake personally, per se. miss days ""crowd cheers Trump drinks water"" would Onion headline ...now can't even make jokes anymore without people going ""wait really he?""

Masks prevent others getting sick you, important people wear mask, people? know antibody testing established effective, everyone wears mask. mid July we’ll wait August. 

And August we’ll wait schools open

And September we’ll wait weather gets colder 

And November we’ll wait gets really cold Viral Infection Norway Express, European Viral Express Line. ""masks help please buy also medical personel need also wear cloth masks btw masks work"" Aerosol transmission weak, especially outdoors. Surface transmission far likely, hands go literally everywhere, even social distancing. using mask especially washing hands frequently touch mask (which do) potentially introducing pathogens face.

I think using every tool have, reddit obsession mask wearing zero mention hand washing completely kilter. tri-state area much better now. remember going Worldometer nerve wracking everyday months. get actually kind relieved. still remember deaths NY nearing 1000 day close 500 NJ. Orange County (Orlando) slow implement mask order, it’s 90+ weeks humidity population really needs masks optional. Fastest solution coronavirus elimination: Human annihilation. Skynet begins. staying home quarantine. go necessities. oh yes course gather group hundreds people protest. dont hang friends. ""biased"" ""China centric"". anything US centric biggest single donor country. virus may bit concentrated mask due inhalation, risk touching face mask exterior put remove incorrectly, want use one contaminated.

All exterior clothing, hair exposed skin may contaminated virus threat gets eyes respiratory system, otherwise harmless. People often touch faces without noticing washing hands still critical. good practice change clothing least wash face soap get home, showering washing hair would perfect. 

The virus lipid covering, wash good enough remove grease clothes get rid virus, extra safety use hot water.  Netherlands too. lot Asian Countries masks socially common even Covid. think people far less reluctant faster use west. Im sure production, stocks etc play good role well. isnt working India Federal Government given up. Like Drago said Rocky III ""If dies, dies"". Good luck😎 know me, fuck face. efforts go towards first time home buyers people need help fixing credit. much landlords investors. Like need justify fucking redditor. believe one blamed most. remember encourage mask wearing general public first. Worse, actually discouraged fear depleting mask supplies medical facilities. took April reverse recommendation! 

I remember people saying wearing masks selfish irrational depleting market ""WHO says effective."" shows badly handled live Japan, people love masks.

Seriously, can't believe badly handled whole issue... mean, believe fear depleted mask supplies medical workers justified one, especially western countries supply chain strong. understand scientific evidence mask wearing effective. mean discouraging mask wearing every country world right thing. message ""We know effective. Governments keep enough supplies medical workers increase supplies case proven effective."" Seriously.

The Asian countries named article succeeded (relatively speaking) people/government ignored saying went instinct/habit anyway. case.

And stop using language like ""no scientific evidence yet."" Instead simply say ""we know yet"" that's mean. bound lots people interpret ""no evidence"" ""no."" believe general public understand finer difference, they're bad need PR specialists, spokesperson political advisors. seems pretty easy to..you know, do? least person. middle pandemic could've shut fuck leave politics politicians.  Almost looks like people can’t understand simple instructions. Mask, distance, wash hands. people deliberately? Hmmmm..... masks won’t help Kohfeldt Werder stay 1. Bundesliga. breath carries whole lot moisture.

Breathing dry oxygen tank breathing mask. Yes, people cough sneeze, imagine scattering mask protect you. droplets microscopic float around, lot good social distancing would litte wind carrying scattering over.

Man, guys rediculous. fking wonder. funny stock value slightly went since announcement think confusing right work will. Right work pertains unions. Netherlands. We've started using masks public transport weeks ago, impossible keep 5 feet distance needed transportation. 

I'm sure well we've done here, celebrated carnival February, went en masse Italy. two big factors, I'm sure numbers would've much better currently. Masks masks.

It's one thing, combination factors. went Orlando got lousy coronavirus Wow. Another study. We’re learning much days! UPS TODAY made supervisors wear masks talking workers wearing masks. much extended close contact guys professors college?

From professor side likely several 1to1s day, usually seated tutorial undergrads regular close contact sessions cup tea post grads. Due size office well inside social distancing measures. could give bigger office. Correlation ≠ causation. 

The quicker country required people wear masks, quicker implemented social distancing. quicker shut work forces etc. 

Also. wear mask, less likely go general simply one hurdle. little bit expensive Ideally yes, least reopened state. Sweden closed borders everyone outside Europe, despite nothing slow Covid themselves. Interesting. least hand, re-election chances imploding, don’t think we’ll put another four years nonsense. still discussion US, huh....... ""It disappear April"" legitimate reason lie public.

Yea, that's political decision medical/scientific one. stuck job avoid criticism distrust. good people can't trust them? lied us prevent runs supply chain fragile, never fragile was.

There isn’t lot nuance airborne transmission viruses. Masks either helpful stopping one person spreading virus another. data SARS MERS spread, every scenario applicable, masks help prevent spread. That’s including huge sums data eastern Asia’s regular usage masks stopping spread kinds regular diseases.

We argue day whether lie good idea (I posted elsewhere opinions indicating belief dangerous short-sighted) , it’s hard argue lie.  clear even saying reopen. countering guy's statement. saying virus' spread growing ""exponentially"" everywhere New York. pointed know exponential meant showed actually decreasing Michigan. 

He lost called jackass. recoveries? lets check back 6 months see many actually recovered actually think idiots parties isolating attending them? interesting country like Denmark largely contained virus, yet noone wearing masks. Instead extreme focus hand sanitization. seems work alright well. I'm hoping covid lot silver linings develop cultural changes US. lack need us sell 90% time lives employers. countries fine shorter workdays time off, can't US same?

That's probably one reason many families fracture. Enriching CEO family, quality life, personal freedoms, per US culture. invented 5G. wonder coronavirus started there! /s ""emergent""? ithink partisan gap problem long virus. remember lmao Acquired Thats early age told kids ""People stupid""...we still quote day thier early 20's Maybe nature take course. 🤞 Huh, fooled appearances then.

Looks like every country want accept Herd immunity find unlikely global conspiracy. argue dirty wife beater wearing consumer? may anti-mask, first people heard pro-mask arguments from, back still vehemently anti-mask, Lex Friedman Eric Weinstein 2 different podcasts show. 

That's beauty podcast. He's host/an entertainer, guests often say things agree with. people appear influenced intelligent guests probably kinds people already thinking way anyway (preaching converted). think comes fact masks effective blocking virus. works well sneezing elbow, talk/sing loudly open mouth. 
However, there's apparently plenty different benefits masks. working hypothesis people aware virus take precautions confronted masks. going put mask, also likely touch face wash hands often.

So entirely wrong people initially thought masks work (since block virus), yet truth work. people shift opinion accordingly. thing. 

Originally it, since thought unnecessary due scientific research showing almost benefit. evidence piling work, whatever reason may be, changed opinion completely. Half husbands family health sector many different occupations. try tell half bad is. half thinks they’re lying over-exaggerating. husband, parents health sector side. Seeing burnt absolutely miserable. say hasn’t even really begun yet. think wait ans see one. may right, deaths lags mid July say certain like experience SARS viruses this. proof masks ineffective reducing transmissions, protect wearer. based info told us wear them. 

It's clear wanted preserve masks medical personell, completely ignoring fact would less patients people wore masks. know CDC WHO, frankly care anymore. Last time listen either them. Propagandabots real yeah. best health think global numbers accurate? Russia Brazil testing enough get accurate numbers? definitely didn’t—he lost popular vote certainly (though may win electoral college anyway). Glitter!!!??? monster. states, regardless leads them, failed reduce active infections zero countries done successfully.

Our two party system continues fail us.  right can't socially distance rest lives. PHYSICALLY distance though foreseeable future. Call Mom Pops make sure okay, enjoy Zoom meeting. PHYSICALLY distance. much extrovert changed ways fellow human. uncle right. Decimate means 10%, virus decimate human population.  death rate 1/60th U.S., 1/100th UK. Smaller numbers senior citizens doesn’t begin explain discrepancy. Yeah ATP event. went organized personally, specifically ATP shut down. allowed fans seen partying playing basketball multiple players well taking pictures hugging touching players without masks. also crossed border participate event initially refused testing. significantly WORSE showing appearance fee. global numbers 150k per day. suggest 100k per day UK march totally ludicrous I'd love see national mask requirement US. Let's make happen, politicians! Novak claims symptoms. Dimitrov, first one tested positive attending te tour fever felt weak. Borna Coric, tested positive playing Dimitrov also claims symptoms. stay safe yes I'm referring U.S. - response pandemic made absolutely terrified administration would handle serious crisis, foreign invasion even something far aliens showing up. hard accept intelligent species planet, simply fit in. stupid shit. I'm without words honest. comment fringe. try deeply understand situation requires understanding thought came grips invented wheel. much take - time dodging infection. majority world seems within reason, that's pretty much thing holding shit together right now. tough accept island ignorant U.S. perception, ""wasn't supposed happen US"" opened eyes bad things really are. long job make living leave mark good. reality old backwards ass men make decisions based pleasing base, etc etc .. fuck dude. I'm close becoming doomsday prepper moving hills solitude world. virus done lot good bad, despite impact. Eyes opened. us U.S. ridiculously clear leadership gives absolutely fucks well being... that's tough pill swallow. think could monitor border crossing hefty fine quarantine violations. case caught contact tracing get hit $10k penalty.

If return trip thinking hitting bar (with guaranteed cameras), might want think times. spreading event bar - even - might $10k fine incoming.

How much *really* need go bar? Florida still discounting non-resident deaths within state toll, asshattery finally fixed?  president setting terrible example followers? trust news, past even supposed discuss ""you know who"" subreddit 'it's politics.' love glitter It’s bad look worry others panties well. you. don’t believe “protecting others” without express consent method protecting them. would never refuse give someone plastic bag insist walk instead drive order “protect others” polluted planet. You’re free protect others see fit, don’t expect others protect others way too. House, led blue majority, went recess pandemic.

They return Senate goes recess.

There's single redeemable party. Aren’t supposed *put on* last minute?

(Not actually recommended!!!) I've trying tell everyone know bars/restaurants churches going high risk activities avoided. 

Governments dont want say kill restaurant industry religious people lots voting power. reason US army decided let former Covid patient join. love OBX that's win y'alls part People always made fun looks weird Asian people wearing masks.
Then now... Surgical masks roughly 70% effective, respirators generally 95% effective depending properly fit tested. Cloth masks effective surgical mask. It’s masks addition distancing works. can’t distance respirator required. Taiwan mostly outsourced mask production well, mere 1.88 million produced per day virus hit.

However, original 60 productions lines raised daily production 10 million late March, 32 production lines added later raised daily production 16 million late April. fine-tuning, production brought 19 million mid-May. enough masks go around everybody export ban even relaxed Jun 1.

Taiwan tiny island. I'm sure industrial prowess money available, US producing tens, hundreds millions per day late March, timeframe Taiwan quintupled production. that's needed government understand masks crucial defending respiratory disease, frank situation (medical personnel would guaranteed supply masks first, rest rationed), spend really insignificant sum money push domestic suppliers ramp production.

It's impossible -- even late -- now. China resumed supplying majority world's masks, risk remains China ban exports things heat there. There's nothing like securing supply important piece protection, even front line medical professionals. steroidal treatment seems promising cases oxygen ventilation indicated, upto -35% death rate. Extremely cheap treatment looks liek bit lifeline early testing fairness say good die young. asshole probably live 140 rate. hope not. Living absolutely awful. Makes angry states handling things. started opening 2 weeks ago it’s fantastic sense normalcy without uptick. Fingers crossed ya go. Look day day. COVID cause respitory distress, cause cops kneel neck. stay home please Like ten years selective enforcement rules okay you, may may offend people?

* Either city blatantly trying infect POC, know affected horrors virus

* trying laws/rules white people only.

Mind you, county directive clearly violates United States Civil Rights Act 1964 (Public Law 88–352, 78 Statutes Large 241) Oregon Revised Statutes 659A (Unlawful Discrimination).

Civil Rights Act Title II prohibits discrimination public accommodations engaged interstate commerce basis ""race, color, religion, national origin.""

Civil Rights Act Title VI prohibits discrimination program activity receiving federal financial assistance basis ""race, color, national origin.""

Oregon Revised Statutes 659A.103 prohibits discrimination public accommodations basis ""race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status age individual age.""

The Lincoln County Health &amp; Human Services Department, public health administrator health officer, creating exception public health directive ""people color,"" violation United States Statutes Large Oregon Revised let's keep mind, could gone differently pressure administration manufacture import masks immediately instead (to day) top leadership deny effectiveness wear all. know I'm talking about... fuck going Starbucks right damn drive through? interesting disturbing theory. hope wrong. one areas basically beaten it, supposedly. 2 cases early city say contained without spread, maybe see months.

The thing makes think wrong aggressively testing here. Anyone even sore throat told get tested without doctor referral, free. Despite lots tests, turning cases. theory right requires slow burn would also undetectable contact incubation period. restrictions Serbia whatsoever? can't wrap head around that. sweden basically dont restrictions rules never did. allowed groups 50 people, unless really want group 50 people nobody stop you, rule also apply private gatherings anyway im mistaken. live cant even get tested, extremely sick caughing lungs 2 weeks ago called begged test since met 85 year old grandfather (at distance 2 meters) day showing symptoms really afraid might infected him, refused since wasnt medical worker. result 5th highest death toll per capita highest death toll while. fucking hate country im absolutely terrified. hope government pays dearly massacre inflicted people reason try save economy experiment see happens shits giggles complete opposite proved work. take 1-2 months least world (except placed like US Brazil) safely receive Swedes ""are facing anxiety, chronic fatigue disability ***for years***"". Um, now? Sensationalize much? Remember well past peak impossible average person get tested. Even key workers struggling get tests. worry virus particles brought inside shoes AC picking circulating Great job fear mongering! Newsom believes science data. could happen? spread respiratory droplets true airborne disease. Masks mitigating factor. I'm similar boat given risk factors.

It really feels like we're abandoned. barely save ourselves. help others abandoned government? Jesus Christ, wear damned mask overthink it. temperature kills it, UV light get enough kill that's hard. Spread less successful outside though. Good Read: John Pavlovitz: [**A Mask Stupid Hill Die Time OSHA complaint, that’s illegal. Masks make hard eat priced popcorn. Need 3d goggles, mask way eat popcorn drink soda still safe. 100,000 new cases every day?? don’t think so. government trying test 100,000 per day. 8 million tests approx administered 300,000 confirmed cases overall UK. 

Granted gone undiscovered, way hell 100,000 new cases every day. seen figure reported. 9 million global cases. 45% we're get lo g term king damage, would 4 million cases study.

Quit making shit up. context millions it’s reaching 100s millions cases! game percentages.

If 10% keen sneak small roads fine. still 90% reduction. toss major fined contact tracing even 10% hesitate.

This something 100% success required. world right pulling Spanish Flu 2.0 ""it's bad"" ""it's over"" ""it's getting weaker"" comes back slays. yes, exact thing happened Spanish Flu. even anti-mask league. two weeks see death spikes equate rapid infection spike now? Excellent advice. What’s point here? happily retired Ob/Gyn used manage office.

We're enjoying collection bonsai trees creating cactus gardens neighbors, waiting start traveling again. 

Good luck Doctor, stay safe.  Yup.

We two explanations choose from. 

Either China loves people much, single death unacceptable.

Or China absolutely terrified single infection high risk.

We pick whatever narrative want two options. organizer charity event. taken virus seriously. [Maybe still needs Yaaaaaas official death toll around 2,500.. official death toll+probable covid-19 deaths around 8,000.. still much lower compared covid-19 hotspots like italy, us brazil.. indonesian govt currently easing social restrictions.. significant spike next 1-2 months, indonesia interesting outlier.. Disney going open next month?! sounds like great solution overpopulation planet, thanks sharing! Tell staff doctor's office. 🙄 friend hospital Phoenix due horrible car accident. broken, partially paralyzed, facing long recovery. husband can't even visit due COVID. can't imagine would happen caught point. 

Fuck everyone thinks need buy marked beer bar important. Could maybe correlation doesn’t equal causation thing. seems faster country required masks, serious took pandemic quicker introduced precautionary measures. I’m sure masks played part lower deaths I’d surprised could solely pinned tens millions already is. one ""fortunate ones."" Man why'd lie much greatest nation earth ? 

They brainwashing right. Return Dark Ages values enlightenment anathema. intelligence! Viva death! Considering little information gathered people kept getting infected states heavily locked down, there's chance we'll able figure places when/where wide open. Hardly anybody wore masks NZ, never recommended health experts. sent text saying directing app store download would still likely answering call. organised whole thing players got sick too. lot answer for. Mark Kelly way polls McSally. saying cause complancy, remember Feingold way Johnson 2016, Johnson ended catching winning end. So, people Arizona need vote much possable Senate election November, prefetably, mail. taxes* posted 15 times since fairly old news. search threads quite bit discussion already topic. find buy?  1 3....... That's think were... though can't sure good testing. Wow. Never saw one coming. skeptical first like people. thinking way would need wear mask go outside... read reports numbers countries masks really help. 

And worn 1 since going anywhere public/outside. people babies. Fucking it. leave open. everyone knows. tour events pay top players show play couple matches. 

He's sick play wanted appearance fee. Yes, ass.

So I'm going vote mass murdering war criminal wants shoot leg damning us climate change apocalypse.

But apparently makes inhuman.

You, vote someone starves children, bombs hospitals, runs ICE pedophile ring, wants shoot unarmed protesters leg literal bullets.

You define human.

I want anything like you.

You disgust me. So, good China detaining American citizens preventing traveling home?

How think would received? mean, assume you’re describing America? It’s little less polarised Europe, yes fundamentally humans don’t understand risk probability. It’s way calculating brains can’t handle. You’ve either directly affected (friend, family member etc) probably overstate risk, haven’t understate it. government decided leave us (when) get disasters deaths blame us.

I agree we’re pretty fucked. Stay safe Shocking discovery...  You’re quoting antibody tests don’t paint whole picture. We’ve also shit ton testing done. Almost 600k tests 54k positives like checked.

You test people, someone bound it. Maybe it’s bad news saying most. Maybe know months ago. US army allow people tested positive last *x* number months join. think 3.it never lifetime ban articles headlines used word ""ban"" include time window. said hindsight could done things differently. say entire strategy wrong. acceptable source you? There's absolutely reason doubt credibility numbers. many reports many sources indicating situation improving quite time now. current health care insurance situation definitely Americans know better cause know good healthcare looks like

I literally said know system fucked? actually heard argument American South, ""but want see beautiful, smiling faces"". vaccine. 122,634 dead
————————  = 12.2% mortality rate
1,003,258 recoveries

Is accurate? Would greater testing reveal ""recoveries"" thus lower mortality rate? **""We last 15 years theory wanted people skin game, exposure cost health care,"" Rae said. ""That coming fact sometimes really want people get care need get, financial assets cover cost. theories help us normal times helping us pandemic.""** 

Damn, theories never helped us **Matthew Rae, associate director Kaiser Family Foundation's Program Health Care Marketplace** 

Try harder one said going to. look better treatment options go back new kind normal. 647,000 people died heart disease last year (CDC) don’t think twice it. That’s 300 something 9/11’s get emotional pandering bs Also, hides boobies. wife dance tango, lately? back yard. Tango one big swingers party keep clothes stay standing up.

A big part social ritual arrive event greeting partners expressly want dance night trade kisses. normal dance 3 4 songs long close embrace. can't get intimate tango stranger, keeping clothes on.

In words, huge human petri dish event since February we're likely see another one next February. California 5 governors? Well he's likely working Russia, intentional. Texas shall soon known North New Brazil? fucking terrifying. furious? time history knowledge accessible average person ever been, still looking power tell us feel rather using information inform ourselves.

I problem ""Humans stupid"", take great exception ""Humans choosing stupid stupid takes effort"" get constituents infected. expect sudden spike deaths?

I wouldn’t say it’s “sudden spike”, rather continuous steady increase number deaths ICUs hospitals get filled up. It’s also likely gotten better treating disease catching covid cases earlier increased testing. current deathrate point here, original comment challenging suggestiong US ought start wearing masks, claiming ineffective.

Regardless what's happening now, Finland, Norway Denmark many thousands cases, could avoided worn masks. (people know) already vaccines coronavirus. really think 45 would running around without mask unless already took vaccine... wake Dammit Branson! would definitely pay service. prefer abusive relationships free lol cloth masks triple layered pocket filter. either triple layer coffee filter pocket triple layer thick reusable filter. four layers. isn’t protecting (which truly feel does) wtf? already can’t breathe lack oxygen brain worry I’m wearing it’s 1000000% perfect. Takes long time unlearn propaganda. Really shitty trying lose election?
 
The stupid thing he's not. side made COVID mask political issue opposed public health one. He's happy endanger health voter base specifically keep throwing red meat. may born bred NYC girl, love respect entire state. focused specifically downstate am, worst tragedy hit, also difficult shelter place avoid people.

Most us backyard. Many families live apartments 1/4 size average house. Imagine one two small children spending three months trying keep everyone sane four little rooms. playgrounds closed. schools closed. you, unhappy six-year old toddler, day night. 

To manage stress along economic stress fear bringing home deadly virus every time venture empty supermarket find quart milk? That's whole lot put someone. everyone it, took stones. 

I love world upstate. choose live quiet, rural community escape problems city, NYer, sometimes problems find way same. NYer matter whether live Franklin County Kings County, square shoulders meet challenge anyway. Meanwhile Mexico masks encouraged lot states start we'll still 5th/4th country deaths end month Perhabs discuss comorbidities like age, hypertension rate, obesity rates,etc., analyzing effect HCQ death rates whole country like analyzing patients trial. way one explanation offered due Asian countries higher testing rates, infected people separated quarantined effectively. example Indonesia disqualifies explanation.

 Also, possibility genetic factors need considered. false brilliant idea. live Houston. 

*Ralph Wiggins’ Voice* We’re danger someone PLEASE tell US this!? bunch us would rather wear tin foil hats masks hide oh, evil 5G towers! mean there's way think 45 September 11ths counting sound bad? Marion, 95 percent testing positive asymptomatic.

This study April, know yet many merely presymptomatic? Expecting us govenment job become unrealistic People really eager blame beaches churches, tens thousands people close together somehow blamed?

Like officials even made exceptions protests applied gatherings, even though makes difference virus. Wishful thinking aside, cruel sequence inevitability play regions experiencing exponential spread: 

FIRST increased exposures, followed lag;

NEXT increased positive tests, followed lag;

NEXT increased hospitalizations, followed lag;

FINALLY, biggest tragedy, increased deaths.

STILL UNKNOWN: Long-term impact disease survivors severe Covid.

(ALSO NOTE: current anomaly — rising aggregate infections falling aggregate deaths — exists time lags exposure death. month, many families mourning loved ones.) many tests done daily Europe vs. US? Well two years old made two years ago. 

And posts two months ago clean posts time time. Lot red states there...wonder why? Agree! husband, kids ones still social distancing. go groceries.My husband essential worker. mother law keeps telling im harming kids immune systems home. Um... nope. told treat like flu allergies. one kids gets sick stay room. Every time husbands family get together send text saying time &amp; date who's house then... scared corona understand really hope see all. infuriating. literally true everywhere. bad New York much worse. Sure, feel closer kids. I’m also going insane. Florida? Texas? California? Nah. vaccine. really think 45’s old ass would running around without mask requiring people around wear mask didn’t already take vaccine. Wake up! example, Switzerland announced Friday March 13 schools/restaurants/bars/etc would closed end weekend. peak new cases came 10 days later March 26 (using rolling average). 

Check tabs here: First golden rule greedy rich is""dont share"". leadership(as Trump fucking cronies) dumbasses refuse actually implement sensible policies. Yep. sub turned cancerous. bills hub information, general populace fallen deep end, can't understand difference ""changing policy based new information"" ""outright maliciously lied."" Whoever downvoted this, mom’s hoe Ah thanks. date ”Nov 11” translation streets got confused little bit. qlso humid there, least went last year may. use it. Got bit many times even count lol Even that's smokescreen. Absolutely zero limiting export manufacturing jobs. anti-Chinese BS. jobs go China low cost labor country going help Americans. Basically, mask protects others catching virus you. prevents spreading virus, protection.

The thing is, everyonz wears it, everyone protected (by solidarity others). Also could think virus wear - that's true could asymptomatic spread virus anyway. Yep. April gets . . . first time saw spit drink laughing never listen Fauci again. never said that. virus going point safely open places up. exactly it. guideline came state stated things needed safely open building can’t met buildings can’t open.
One anyone (student, teacher, staff etc) symptoms must stay home ten days.

Great, love safety that.
 However get 13 days total use year. cough sept oct (allergies, cold, etc) I’ve used ten 13 days.
What happens rest year? mention extra days given district. mention attendance policy chance students. kids cough sometimes there. can’t ten days (neither teachers staff) every single time sore throat single symptom $$$ reasons practicality.

It’s insane. every year expectation come unless you’re dying. Quite swing policy. 

But afford time off? many people, particularly teachers don’t high pay need save time their
Kids sick too.
It’s nightmare. seem effect virus, even people ""Recovered"", tasks people use ease, leaves short breath. true cases, quite few, seems happen. recovery shortness breath chest tightness WEEKS. three months feeling like shit went away. heterogeneous picture. places made little progress, number reasons seeing disease spike earnest. areas made good progress, chalk good regional governance anything done federal level. numbers hundreds per day R number relatively easy calculate. False. cares Donald Trump (but Donald Trump, Jr.). legitimate reason lie public.

Go ahead source that. Everyone tossing around ""lie"" objective truth. statements made absolutely lies, proof lies knowledge individual time? Novak Djokovic tested positive coronavirus Tuesday taking part tennis exhibition series organized Serbia Croatia.

The top-ranked Serb fourth player test positive virus first playing Belgrade last weekend Zadar, Croatia. wife also tested positive.

“The moment arrived Belgrade went tested. result positive, Jelena’s, results children negative,” Djokovic said statement.

Djokovic criticized organizing tournament bringing players countries amid coronavirus pandemic.

Viktor Troicki said Tuesday pregnant wife diagnosed virus, Grigor Dimitrov, three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Bulgaria, said Sunday tested positive. Borna Coric played Dimitrov Saturday Zadar said Monday also tested positive.

There social distancing measures observed matches either country Djokovic players seen hugging partying night clubs restaurants matches.
“Everything past month, pure heart sincere intentions,” Djokovic said. “Our tournament meant unite share message solidarity compassion throughout region.”
Djokovic, previously said taking vaccine virus even became mandatory travel, face behind Adria Tour, series exhibition events started Serbian capital moved Zadar.

He left Croatia final canceled tested Belgrade. statement said Djokovic showing symptoms.
Despite positive test, Djokovic defended exhibition series.

“It born philanthropic idea, direct raised funds towards people need warmed heart see everybody strongly responded this,” Djokovic said. “We organized tournament moment virus weakened, believing conditions hosting Tour met.

“Unfortunately, virus still present, new reality still learning cope live with.”
Djokovic said remain self-isolation 14 days also apologized anyone became infected result series.

Organizers Adria Tour said third stage event, scheduled held next week Bosnia, canceled.

The list includes country even though recommendation mask use nationwide level even municipal level required businesses ive seen either, study doesnt provide source date either unlike countries. Basically ive seen people wear mask whole year. suspect similar countries list yet considered ""mask country"" study skews results heavily undermines whole paper,. kidding. 

We chose herd immunity backed delaying lockdown week.

Our contact tracing teams 4 hours training. 

Our PPE shortages we're appalling

Exact May 1st, testing far less available mild cases. expect sudden spike deaths? know people take 2+ months post infection die, norm would halved daily death rate since Late April. shops+pubs going bust (really horrible owners, fallbacks survive) Possibly thousands people getting seriously ill/dying ..... even debate saving human lives somehow important keeping holy economy going... fucking billionaires country. millionaires government actually shared thier wealth least managed th country intelligently wouldnt poressure put economy human life. wtf source this? accept may high I'm gonna bet BBC health correspondent better idea random people Reddit.

We're even short term we're encountering negative consequences already! like experience SARS viruses this.

You're exactly right, part problem. expected act like SARS/MERS, didn't. SARS/MERS contained shed virus symptomatic, assumed case proof masks ineffective reducing transmissions, protect wearer.

Exactly. enough masks time mask entire population, look like even important begin (as mentioned above, assumed primarily worry symptomatic folks, quarantined based info told us wear them. even realize batshit insane coming scientific public institution?

...no. insane. Stop pretending understand situation better public health professionals. Show humility step back look situation then. Hindsight 20/20, mean judge decisions information clear wanted preserve masks medical personell

Chinese state-owned developer authorised start phase three human trials Covid-19 vaccine candidate United Arab Emirates.  National Biotec Group said clinical trials approved UAE’s Ministry Health Prevention teleconference Tuesday.  subsidiary, Wuhan Institute Biological Products, completed phase two human trials inactivated vaccine candidate showed safe produced high levels neutralising antibodies. Another candidate developed second subsidiary group undergoing phase two trials.  developers looking overseas phase three trials – involve thousands people – longer enough cases Covid-19 within China, considered suitable testing. Two Chinese developers, CanSino Sinovac Biotech, previously announced start phase three trials elsewhere – Canada Brazil, respectively.  announcement came hours developers another vaccine – Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Institute Microbiology Chinese Academy Sciences – said candidate approved human trials, without saying would carried out.  said candidate, known recombinant subunit vaccine, involved one part virus – spike protein antigen – induce immune response. Antigens cause body produce antibodies help fend disease. recombinant subunit approach also used vaccines hepatitis B, human papillomavirus HPV, influenza.  means China three different types vaccine technology fight Covid-19 going human trials.

Two inactivated vaccine hopefuls still phase two trials.  Institute Microbiology said statement vaccine candidate shown safe effective animal trials.  mice shown “obvious protective effect”, results rhesus macaques “showed vaccine induced high levels neutralising antibodies, reduced viral load lung tissue, reduced lung damage caused viral infection, achieved significant protective effect”, statement said.  added potential vaccine could produced large quantities low cost, making accessible.  antigen developed two teams led Gao Fu, academician director Chinese Centre Disease Control Prevention, Yan Jinghua, researcher Institute Microbiology.  candidate based previous research vaccine another coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Mers, human body’s inflammatory response new coronavirus.  immunisation expert Tao Lina said, theory, technology used vaccine candidate may advantage creating stronger immune response fewer adverse effects.  said would also easier mass-produce vaccine.  statement Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products, parent company Anhui Zhifei, noted vaccine development long difficult process, still big uncertainties.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sad right. Sick leave actually much generous Denmark Sweden, wherein take sick leave whenever want without doctor's note cases employers ask one least week many month more. 

The point is: Danish government employers *want protect people harm*. diease dangerous, involves yet unknown disability burden. clearly ahuge risk talented employees traveling hot spot, since may become ill possibly die become permanently disabled. may also infect talented employees iwth said dangerous disease.

Clearly, situation avoided. Well, clear appears backers Swedish strategy seems quite confusing. clear, protests may sparked Floyd incident, much larger issue. experience actually stupid requires effort stupid. read too. sent relative heard hopeful waiting test results end self-quarantine. Yes did! put mandatory two week quarantine people flying New York places. think unfortunate side effect individualism. consider individualism *mostly* good thing (within reason), obviously result counterproductive behavior public health situation really need something greater good rather exclusively. 

And fair, America big place, compliance varies region. am, see 80-90% people wearing masks local government proactive beginning. think much US suffered inconsistent messaging. Better days ahead im sure, gotta get I'm adult, one safest countries covid-wise, already PTSD depression/anxiety caused pandemic. can't imagine levels mental distress people affected countries experiencing right now... true agree, responding question ""what's excuse?"". I'm trying stay cautious possible months now. feel horrible people forced face since began. News articles headlines scientific reports. interested reading actual study. google came empty asked question. big issue, one highlighted commenters responded ""Reopen"" Protests, spread standpoint, less severe scale current protests...but imagine see one foolish selfish okay. 

I never did, although disagreed message protests, never disagreed anyone protesting. several protests going around time--Amazon workers, medical professionals wanting PPE-- supportive well. Americans fight rights, one else help them. see anyone look what's going say system working. government broken can't wait November fix it. Let tell Kissimmee area go Old Town / Fun Spot area majority people go wearing masks social distancing all. Florida becomes next epicenter it’s negligence like this. understand hard people wear masks News articles headlines scientific reports. interested reading actual study. google came empty asked question. be. live dictatorship. Yup I'm healthcare, mandatory us genocide appropriate term describe indiscriminate slaughter old people? look state PDF report ([http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/\_partners/action/report\_archive/state/state\_reports\_latest.pdf](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/action/report_archive/state/state_reports_latest.pdf)\_

It says ""Data Jun 22, 2020 verified Jun 23, 2020 08:25 AM""

Usually says something like ""Data Jun 22, 2020 (verified 10 AM)""

It seems like updated added cases yesterday added anything today yet I'm prob wrong. kinda worded confusingly Common sense

Please don't. People common sense. Invoking common sense recipe disaster. really bad policy. Florida restrict testing symptomatic. Testing sites can't capture people actually sick, thousands asymptomatic people seeking tests, disease. Ok do.omer didunt war mask sex mah gurlfriend, get pregat? Yup... link anxiety persons character/weaknesses

That remedied it’s diagnosed like ADD entire generation children think issue significant amount Americans powered ideology. love concepts things. concept American means. 35 people sitting classroom practically shoulder shoulder. 3 feet professor front row. Less students. fuck wrong you?

No ventilation. PPE.

Fucking death trap. Went doctors Texas moron TOOK MASK COUGH. Can’t make shit  anyone info June 8th Branch county high, I'd interested. 
  Thank replying this, however news articles links studies. interested reading studies headlines. entirely sure voted asking question read scientific studies. trying dispute simply wanted read them. able find studies directly focused Air Conditioning issue, read conjecture speculation news media without citing sources. know increases vector? Protests. Regardless reason. also anti-1% protests forever doomed fail.

say more. i'm interested. take ever major dental procedures zero issues. Oh, ok. ""wow, that's lot!"" kind made seem like thought high number bad thing. Glad agree opposite then. one vaccine either, either let work society **in controlled manner, protecting vulnerable** runs people without immunity

Ah, Swedish response. death rate Sweden 4x higher neighbors? Exactly this... nephew young healthy, exposed covid won’t take test cause wants join army co-workers symptoms? It’s still early determine accurate rates takes place younger individuals.

 Also important note non-tennis community people tournaments Novak organized sanctioned large professional body like ATP.

The ATP going far, far, far stringent procedures fucking douche. US Open actual professional tournaments hope serve prime example bring back major sports. high hopes US Open. think we're supposed meet eat corn chicken first? Two birds one stone lol  100%the queen England ""I suspect..."" confidence inspiring. good, someone told human existence set-up punchline, question even second Correllation =/= causation. Australia still reccomend masks almost cases. likely, countries reccomended masks early took virus seriously, measures heavy lifting. likely VA didn’t care whether she’s different see recent study, including that? Purposefully hiring people prone shit like Norway, Denmark, Finland Iceland people using masks deaths. looking excess deaths even possible see disease arrived countries, remained within normal range throughout essentually flat line peaks: . pattern seen number COVID-19 hospitalizations; remaining patients countries.

However, Norway, Denmark, Finland Iceland quite early lockdowns (the extent varied, none ""hard"" lockdown stay-at-home orders), distancing rules and/or lots testing. Lots meth stories local newspaper. think people going rough time. ""phases"" might well sweet talk live South Florida (which hotspot) idk phase matter many acting like life normal pandemic over. barely tell depending go. inconsistent lot places dont even mask requirements. Could use vials intended flu vaccine skip flu vaccine year? Granted, flu deadly deadly covid. Posting 4 NYC time...

It's possible, still curious. Yeah, there's problem division forcing people align one two problematic narratives. China totalitarian dictatorship definitely handled outbreak incredibly improperly likely lies spread, still mean manufactured pandemic. Gotta remember middle ground. Maybe masks glitter coated. part Northeast Texas, people get dirty looks wearing masks. U funny 😂. like penis envy inferiority complex...we get it. Sorry advance someone else posted advice. 

Keep clean bag store mask desk. Also, take mask off, fold part facing inside fold. words, side mask faces visible fold store it. Large gathering would cover that. 

If get specific, people answer lie. already drones surveilling protests. Even nothing wrong, still portion afraid profiled.

This went wrong South Korea. People want names associated list gay dance club gave false info. South Korea unable contract trace people come forward. Meal team six - Gravy Seals - US control group reporting ~~tendies~~ duty. Time leave r/Coronavirus believe probably countries implement mask requirements earlier would generally take virus much seriously. That's fair point. lot better around recently least. Odd see restrooms soap bottles chained sinks (not literally chains course) coworker go SC 5 days came back late last week, straight work shop floor, quarantine anything. 

I'm waiting first one get sick.  Full randomised double-blind clinical trials things prove drug effective.

Many many drugs failed final hurdle, knows many person-years worth effort. What'd throw holly water humidifier? UK ... STILL require masks. Im 23, never surgery, disease, etc. physical late last year everything came fine. symptoms mild longest lasting one sense taste smell never fully came back. completely disappeared month it’s back doesn’t feel like before. Could mind ofc, I’m sure. Everyone know symptom. Wait lied said need masks people skeptical anti-mask? make sense, ""people"" refer would either believe he's lying case there's reason upset said initially (that need masks) spiteful assholes disregard safety others mad Fauci. former there's reason think thousands medical professionals scientists lying now.

Also freedom parts come in? people defying mask orders citing Fauci, claiming constitutional right asshole. भयंकर अखंड. like- how, how, H W contracted shiz yet??

You one person Corona! Set good example! People see without mask know history. least far less stressed actually catching go easier lot precautions. posted article last week explains many health professionals think temperature screenings effective. Covid19 survivors including asymptomatic showing perm neurological lung damage likely result life threatening complications later life mention reduction life expectancy. Decades virus gone people still dying due covid19. isnt recovery delay death. want get sick first place r/Masks4All folks antibody study results: insane case count considering AZ 1/4 population Texas. claimed cure. held accountable immunity booster cure, claimed yoga guru Baba Ramdev Tuesday*** unveiled, calls, first ayurvedic medicine coronavirus, even scientific community world fighting hard come cure highly contagious disease. Mission accomplished! Delete r/coronavirus subreddit. mask face. touch mask good chance touched face too. 

After touching mask always sanitize hands. Sounds like read study then, rather headline. single sentence summary 37 page statistical study overly simplified 100% true every case? shock. 

Anyway comparing results country virus appeared island nations capacity extreme border control ridiculous. I’m sure Canadian Flag paraphernalia average American then, Canadians do. course American family members friends “embarrassed” American, seems embarrassed related immature dipshit like you, that’s are, matter call adult. spent 20 years living Canada. know type deep, thoughtful observations. You’re cliche creep, said, get lost. He's using cheap antibody notoriously high false negatives.

He's testing SARS-COV2. clean if, statement. would prefer be? likely. crowd actually less half America; they're loud obnoxious it. Data examples matter. made measure loyalty ones political party. Tribalism drive happens, science. Except seems uniquely American problem, human problem live PA county highest new case count since beginning May. half cases came people traveling state. absolutely infuriated lose hard progress due imbeciles south. governor fucking idiot concerned politics life. true homemade masks. types masks I've made home. One couple layers cotton non-woven felt layer. get thrown washing machine as-is fine. There's another type husband likes wear cotton pocket filtration material. remove filtration material (and discard) wash rest mask washing machine. idiots going “but muh freedom! duh economy!”

But....your countries health well being? Legislation without enforcement looking votes. think person referring air soup Florida time year. masks get wet damp quicker, make harder breathe mask wet. 100% used doors, outdoors actually legit problems. combination social distancing masks possible probably best. definitely go jogging mask Florida time year Good luck enforcing that. ""Don't tread freedoms!"" Ya say I'm glad OK, still anecdotal evidence. agree getting haircut much smaller risk going gathering hundreds people first death February 28th. 

Incorrect. first two people died [February Ok well let's study another 5 years uncover causal link rather agree worth wearing masks disease still spreading. likely country requires masks quicker top many facets compared country would take longer.

What facets? data using hypothesize correlation? Yes exactly one fears. I'm decently healthy, 39 yo family gets age pneumonia common threat. I'm sure people get side effects damn, I'm healthy chance. exactly live healthy life. worth risk me. Repost baby! two groups close proximity, one feeds other. 

Source: American JOB MEANS ENJOY LIFE FAMILY, SACRIFICE LIFE FAMILY JOB! USA infected mentality, largely pushed corporations legislations make sacrificing everything else people’s choice pay bills. It’s holdover old forum days. means “too long; didn’t read.” It’s usually header tail post provides summary larger argument story. also used snarkily tell people they’re long winded use dick never intended read argument first place. 

In case I’m using dick, ironically. also studies done show even people virus sure, tested positive symptoms- people antibodies. Prbly gets extended, they've always done Australia. mask requirement smashed rona pregnant girlfriend basically left house since early March. time walking pick weed dealer street late night people occasionally going grocery store closing hours lot people there. house two stories part stays upstairs watches movies stay downstairs play video games. quarantine awesome us lol. cam girl makes twice much rent month onlyfans. working cut back staff tremendously I've getting 1400+ every 2 weeks unemployment. Sorry wife tough time. Maybe try spending time alone? seems working us. rarely get other's nerves even though world around us fucked (were Texas) silver lining realized strong bond whole pandemic. Well free travel .. simply go another region kinda free again... somewhat encourages travel ... wife worked supermarket near Paris airport.  really poorly phrased headline. doctor's license practice revoked suspended front desk receptionist patient gets infected? President thinks wearing masks look good. suspect source movie outbreak. movie would never make shit plot. Also see r/covid19positive - loads people recovered without going hospital still feeling effects months recovery. simple fact don’t know 12 month, 5 year, 10 year prognosis infection disease hasn’t around long. Like, give vastly higher lung cancer risk example? way know wait. choose take big unquantified risk take precautiot Add Carolinas list. Still, 46 140 representative sample.  baffles others refused get tested, why, why? extension pretty good bet.  Exactly! said nothing different. live NRW too! Gütersloh. 
""Only lasting 1st July"" partly right, prbly gets extended fair bit. Yea around 10 vaccines clinical trials right (if recall correctly). Correct I’m sorry you’re voluntarily gathering crowds thousands makes sense whatsoever.


Obviously police blame many things, sure isn’t kept check Beatings? Ah makes sense...   actually gotta envy countries travel blacklist. COVID non-specific symptoms illness could misinterpreted COVID, COVID spread earlier think, COVID could misdiagnosed illness. agree, thinking like getting territory seasonal flus, norovirus, similar affect excess mortality. look EuroMOMO stats clearly do, Scandinavia, despite preventable initial response (before lockdowns) covid-19 pandemic showed. Also, check EuroMOMO still clearly see Sweden baseline *and* normal range number deaths, consistent covid-19 eliminated Sweden.

I feel ""is complete elimination covid-19 related deaths reasonable"" completely different discussion ""does Sweden accurately count covid-19 deaths"". (A completely valid discussion course.)

As said comment recent FoHM numbers covid-19 deaths exceed excess mortality Sweden FoHM publicly provided estimates number missed covid-19 deaths. articles linked TenYearsTenDays use numbers. I’m bit tongue-in-cheek here, wanted say grew mask-wearing culture, especially deal first SARS epidemic, stuck that. also past time address fact *indoor* activities biggest risk. Eating restaurant dangerous thing do. 

Building ventilation needs assessed addressed, not. all. Lots buildings closed loop hvac. problem nobody wants admit think. We, uh,... still don’t require masks... ""Not asked""

NOT ALLOWED ASK...

Bc asking people question producing data subject racist! (Racist sense Mayor Willhelm Jr. wants avoid blame allowing protests (and riots looting resulting exodus taxpayers) targeting groups wished gather peacefully outside funeral services.) Chinese influence probability correct? 

Also fall trap many traditional pieces wisdom people assume true actually true. could say number things, like people can't morons believing zodiac, blood pressure personality, acid rain making bald, religions, etc. fact going logic anti-mask person could've said (a months ago) Americans, CDC can't morons masks.   masks eating without gloves smh. Whadadthink would happen? Keeping distance still better long lockdowns starting start seeing big dips? Like start date lockdown significant downward trend new cases observed. False positives almost non issue, false negatives hand well documented Asian countries.


I'm making truth claims btw. I'm throwing shit wall waiting see I'm right wrong. Scientists hypothesize COVID19 manifested strongly people diabetes, also CAUSES diabetes. tried post issue concerning Trump's response, immediately banned, political reasons cited. Um... ok... safe turn AC home ?  African Americans likely develop severe symptoms. Granted average age protests younger, go interact older relatives community members. black community going rough time coming 2 months  Agreed.  study proves obvious. moving air push water droplets slightly drop ground. need direct path air flow sick person increased risk. Someone different room going well beyond 1m also direct path air flow.

I think people impression virus airborne would allow move room room well beyond 1m. far evidence showing case virus travel droplets. see people sneer shame people wearing masks New York. Meanwhile, get people visiting work tourism...everything closed every online ticketing agency know isn’t operating.  Plasma therapy w antibodies... book Anyone heard new mutation going Panama? A2 PAN? Bro don’t use proof logic. looked demographics reddit? US UK originally, world countries demographics would suggest.



tl;dr - want conversation COVID Benin either make thread go post. Every person get test Indiana want positive test results going down. Icu beds going down. I’ve applauded Governor Holcomb’s reopening plan, it’s spot fucking far. States seeing increases need ringing line yesterday basically white people dont like wear masks pattern Oh, like US, letting anyone join cootie party either? April 3, 2020, FDA issued umbrella EUA certain filtering face-piece respirators (FFRs) manufactured China approved National Institutes Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH). mentioned CDC's strategies optimizing respirator supply, countries approve respirators according country-specific standards. devices evaluated using methods similar used NIOSH still expected provide adequate protection healthcare authorised first KN95 masks, finding meet standards narrowed scope, re-issued again. KN95 masks necessarily authorised lot are. There's specific list approved Chinese manufacturers link above. Well see, 80% Wisconsin thinks cough chin. People wearing wrong don’t give shit. Nam 2 USA 0 nonsense. None improve death rate significant margin. Lie bellies? Seriously? haven’t hospital see. 

The treatment virus nearly identical everywhere minor adjustments less harmful drugs. also later admitted wrong strategy chose. gathering would cover that. get specific, people answer lie. already drones surveilling protests. Even nothing wrong, still portion afraid went wrong South Korea. People want names associated list gay dance club gave false info. South Korea unable contract trace people come forward.

Except large gatherings last months protests. tricky. solution. got fried chicken delivered Seoul other. shocked delivery guy without mask. left food outside door washed hands immediately. one tired fauci telling us we're fucked? shits lot mad max realize right now. I'm concerned servers. Got takeout Ohio restaurant weekend, one servers masks around neck. Slovakia fewest cases &amp; deaths per capita (second best like 2,5 3 times deaths per capita) Dane I'm assuming Grønland kind store. I'm sure he's really sad lose know mean. Sweden authorities specifically told us wear mask unless actually symptoms unable stay home whatever reason. still streams Day[9] though. Denmark test -but evidently enough- people coming country start, recognized high-risk regions. Unfortunately Denmark (and Norway+Germany happened), realized late Tyrol Austria considered high-risk region. know majority Denmark's early cases came there, fewer originally recognized high-risk regions.

Denmark full contact tracing time now. Contact tracing mostly self-managed start (which one might describe ""half-hearted voluntary thing""), review found one ten presumed contacts found like that. changed current system full contact tracing, testing known contacts detailed comparison cases see part single outbreak. Look, believe everyone wear masks, hope attend midsummer celebrations, staying home alone entire summer, since going fun whatsoever people clearly possible aspect. 

Saying everyone wear masks saying everyone total lockdown several months (what scientists said back early March). Society simply work way.

And airborne transmission mostly problem enclosed spaces, tunnelbana grocery stores. SL ICA could easily enforce masks wanted, say, getting mask actually feasible enough enforce rules. 

I also surprised lot Asian community bought every single PPE could get hands shipped back home families. Yeah, shit. Positivity rates trending higher too. required wear facemasks times.

Properly?

A lot employees Ohio wear around neck. denial pretty sad man way around, N95 breathability component test, KN95 not. effectively equivalent though, many KN95 masks perfectly breathable. Many manufacturers including 3M make essentially masks pass N95 US, KN95 China, FFP2 EU, P2 Australia/NZ. Frappacinos arent necessary. someone chooses go starbucks they're taking risk. Stay home scared high risk. Youll able find detailed analysis article - ive eead whole thing - another comment mine thread.

As aside, found island didnt significant beneficial impact! Talk reading article. Can't much president telling cronies full shit defunfing them. 

Can't much president worried November lives countryman spreading false, dangerous formation. 

Can't much local leaders following misinformation federal governments spokesman pushing away jobs. 

It starts leadership, country huge lack right now. fact they're significant number horrifying, even less half. Houston also putting adult patients children's hospital need adult beds Yeah that’s bullshit. pay attention long anyone else. media moves owners tell shift narrative. 

How long “paid attention” Trump bad? Four years. it’s constantly reported. 

What supposed media stops prioritizing something? Make news channel? lives live. help people underlying previous medical conditions ? (Hearts surgery, kidney diseases, viruses before). 

Curious helps 1 specific type severe death depending you’re pneumonia something ? helps matter ? Dexamethasone better liveup hype drug nasty af huge list side effects. took little kid treat myocarditis parents said hellish way analogy gasnothing comment either, see I'm walks. it’s time accept family listen selfish needs. Laschet douche. county needs closed ppl barred travelling.
Just recommending enforcing cowardice puts whole country risk. Also remember told us masks dont work. 😯 glad anywhere else world.

Trust me, want live hot country going happen, COVID always going now. accept blame CCP ded office pretty much sharing room whoever else a/c system.

This simply true. Proximity matters still makes huge difference.

There tentative evidence, largely previous outbreaks SARS, airborne transmission example AC systems may _possible_ saying major factor, simply _being_ building infected person within 1m infected person extended period.

I mean obviously not, think second, science back saying.

Don't spread FUD like this. Vietnam country level success **not island**. looking right. [Incubation reported 2-14 days (4-5 days median) onset symptoms death clocked [17-18 days Assuming someone outlier incubation period 14 days dies 18 days onset symptoms, that's 32 days total. That's saying, though. best possible scenario couple got infected day cruise embarked died 31 days later. still falls within even outlier case incubation (32 days). Y'all realize said would masks available health care workers right? like lied understand it. Health care would collapsed general public bought PPE. there's immunity, literally everyone stay home. There's food supply chain, there's grocery store, there's pharmacy, there's hospitals, every single one locations place prolong spread virus. infection points big deal we're trying slow virus wait vaccine. ask CDC one. said two weeks ago standard antibody testing wrong half time. bother read detail busy laughing true Peter Principle turned be. folks go one air conditioned space another.

It's humidity think, though can't help. indoor spaces. We're hearing cases beach trip much bar club. still need info. Texas, hospitalizations 50% last 7 days.

 Houston area 1185 covid patients hospital 2456 available beds left. Also, 202 ICU beds available right now.

Only 1235 ventilators available, trend use quickly, new steroid treatment may keep patients progressing far. Also following gps data phone didn’t help any, either. glad achieved goal flattening heal care curve, no, expected, people still contract mostly harmless Corona Virus. sadly, people immune iussue continue die, largely proper treatments blocked US due corruption USA general, spread lies Hydrocloriquine ineffective (the scientific study claimed retracted) , info readily available sites monitored CCP (most subs, like one, full CCP propaganda)...ie, ytou think Chinese government becoming kinder democratic, making CV pandemic worse, manipulted. remember something looks clean, doesn’t mean is. Looking neat order doesn’t always mean clean. /r/nottheonion factual. job, provide factual information. dead cases. read enough posts realize people clueless comes viruses tell tips maximize chances recovery catch virus finally go hospital

Make sure drink tall glass urine everyday if/when you’re sick. Correlation causation!? LIBERTY!!!!!! Boom goes Covi-dynamite Somehow knew Florida first saw video. fine. flu vaccine always line known sequence year year. That's years worse others. perfect first year almost guarantee that. effective currently population goes down.

Cases unreliable statistic. Excess deaths amount people ICUs better indicator. using masks virus would dumb.

Masks stop people spreading, contracting.

Its day 1 shit people, many understand?

Do wear motorcycle helmet walk check mail?

Or understand something safer, risks outweigh inconvenience? Upstate NY handled coronavirus proactively, however, deserve credit well. doubt actually masks result fewer deaths, probably swift thorough response governments (which also includes requiring masks) contributes most. countries article probably also quick social distancing, lockdowns testing.

I hate everything. think police going spend significant amount resources time enforcing social distancing?

let keep half fine police budget motivate 'em enforce distancing mask laws.

and cities, counties and/or states fine elected officials caught without masks double! Give two weeks. There's enough manpower close state borders round folks violate. 

Even did, courts backed point would Spring 2021 hear basic things.  revising history. Fauci, Adams, Birx telling us thing ""don't wear mask"". Also, objective fact virtues transmitted way objective fact virus airborne others. may airborne originally thought shit happens. 

There plenty nuance. perfectly logical think people wearing masks would make feel safer and, result, leave homes often. original impression virus airborne truly (something learned later...and that's *current* theory), perfectly reasonable ask risk....especially there's short supply masks people treating COVID patients.

People New York don’t need science denying trumpism way way wayyyyyy better Inhibiting IL-6 reduces CRP subsequently inflammation. reason IL-6 inhibitors trialed earlier ? Oh agree entirely. I'm sure pariah social circle makes baseless statements way elicit response. Poor guy. less, accurate say that, overall *effectively* Sweden's neighbors borders closed it.

You sure one r/technicallythetruth there, mate? Quarantine getting eh makes recall efforts prove smoking long-term health effects. Research started earnest 1950's, 1990's research compelling tobacco companies argue way liability court.

And that's long-term effects require long-term studies prove. draw inferences well then, conclusions remain speculative evaluate cohort 40 year period so. leaves medical profession huge concerns, concerns can't quite overcome resistance deniers.

And case, 4 months - even seemingly catastrophic damage, can't fully discount possibility recovery, whether 6 months, 5 years, 10 years.

But can't, sense decency, allow millions people contract disease without serious reckoning potential long term effects - need media assist that, passing along information have, however inconclusive, alert public potential grave threat well being. Covered trays would nice. There's pub nearby go bar get beer, think I'll trying outdoor patio first, without food. now? link? can't go anywhere without phone... Wear masks, lot doors, end lock downs, isolate symptoms, live life. Theme parks pushing open 

That's terrifying. 1. wearing masks correctly. Arguing people don’t shouldn’t use like saying people don’t exercise stop teaching exercise school. need teach/encourage people properly wear masks.

2. Since walked back dangerous surface contamination was, even touching mask risky. see point 1. anyway.

3. It’s health-risk breathe cloth mask anyone would going about. person truly cannot breathe wearing bandana, probably couldn’t breathe without bandana either. That’s mask issue.

4. countries mandated masks super effective! It’s truly LEAST do. One thing sure: public messaging atrocious need brush talking points. Cuomo proposing thing states (including Florida) doing. article linked quarantining New York whole preventing movement out, like disaster movies (think Legend, Cloverfield, Outbreak, etc). IMO biggest effect BLM protests virus wasn’t spread actual protests, doesn’t seem much thankfully, it’s protests signaled people ok go back outside stop thinking virus. spikes come 2 3 generations spread. That's takes month come, onset less 10 days people, many cases caught isolation. Well, least countries try. tired people wearing mask nose. Can't management something this? avoided getting take 3 months first time go drive-thru there's chatty person side window nose sticking top mask.

Come guys HARD Yes, that’s exact shit referring to. Thank illustrative example. Data misleading. long last showing correct image situation Sweden. 

Off course experiencing sudden spike new cases. It’s number infected people much higher European country. How's hospital capacity holding up? Danish strategy involves getting peopel infected possible. Ergo, strongly recommend travel Sweden avoided. would rather use TTI infrastructure care health well people, want see get sick possible. fucking lie lol Dude, quarantined way longer 45 days. haven’t grocery story since March. still package store bring booze car put trunk. isn’t superiority / victim hood, it’s recognizing quarantining SUCKED, worked. Watching southern states whatever want made suck even more. turns tabled, one putting work beating virus wants work undone. think author superiority complex assure boat us here. Thanks stopping by. doubt Ok.. that’s weird fact. idea lol! know little remember world geography class child. US world geography class hasn’t required public schools many years, help explains things Americans... public education sucks. Good thing went private school. [this says damage likely permanent instead either inflammation, fluid build up, blood. heal own.

they also said it’s fair assume happens asymptomatic covid patients, they’ve never ran CT scans asymptomatic cold flu patients might show similar “damages”. 

i hate call fear mongering, source claim like would’ve nice fucking shit. youd read rest thread would know already stated albeit indirectly. post subsequent reply pointless. I'm going block tire deeply explaining isnt genocide, someone go tangent argue point agree 10 hours stopped giving flying fuck post. That's true negate fact one actions would helped, yet either never implemented implemented reactionary measure already far late. 

And mask adoption, least right outside Philadelphia, widespread. Basically everyone understands accepts wearing masks something now, closer NYC get intense becomes - like, cashiers working acrylic enclosures intense.

So Id argue existing American / European thing unfamiliarity thing, Trump thing. He's top bears responsibility setting tone, anti mask campaign set culture rejecting mask usage, least US. doubt think translate mean shit get lot worse. plateau wave 1 going look like mole hill comes fall winter. Keep making leaps son. told you? want buy stocks 😜 know, figured taking break today something. spat **8** articles Sweden less hour. give days nice summer weather? seriously reconsider place work agree, think problem comes democracy, especially election year, politicians worried reelection people. Trump happens even worse. feds might come well. all, moving around country definition 'interstate commerce'. I've couple co-workers get never got tested time heard (my company hid employees, citing HIPAA), 10 days past last contact them. still get tested wait come across another confirmed case? soon.. can't believe white house solved corona virus ignoring it. simple. countries this? /s almost like indoors crowded room. So....... superasshole? People excuse sorts hideous behavior win. agree. think presents clearer picture serious situation is. Many people comparing cases today cases March. cases one region vs another. March testing broken comparison invalid... regions vastly different testing criteria, capacities pct positive outcomes also difficult compare. 

On side, places like Melbourne right almost one hospital measurement everyone watching cases unknown source. case imported found quarantinne, sure case ring fence it. wild case problem. following side effects common (occurring greater 30%) patients taking dexamethasone:

Increased appetite
Irritability
Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
Swelling ankles feet (fluid retention)
Heartburn
Muscle weakness
Impaired wound healing
Increased blood sugar levels. (Persons Diabetes may need blood sugar levels monitored closely possible adjustments diabetes following less common side effects (occurring patients receiving swings
Cataracts bone thinning (with long-term use) way! 

You’re meaning tell respiratory virus transmission slowed masks?!

Noooooo! evidence contributed anything meaningful. Vast majority spread indoors. armed forces*never* let anyone ever covid in, excludes lot otherwise eligible people next decade so, no? already managed get 9 billion euros pledges governments. think make dent that. Besides, she'll probably get money back advertisements alone. know gives info trial results also published today that? Texas? New York incredibly good masks, state discussed. Well yeah, article talking government quarantining New York whole preventing movement out, like disaster movies (think Legend, Cloverfield, Outbreak, etc). states quarantining people states. WTF. home made made masks would sufficed. excuse PPE shortage nice scapegoat though. Unless rated n95, n95. means filters 95% non-oil particles. hope spreads rest world. Trump's going something anyway. Sweden unrecorded deaths, too. happened text post? well written kept imgur link. Doubtful would done stand court law challenge.

You 'seriously consider' want, never going happen. Denmark third deaths care homes, lower international average. 

They, like Sweden, imported LOT cases Alps. fact, [data show imported slightly Sweden 

Denmark also denser Sweden terms population density, correlated worse spread. Much Copenhagen tight packed, narrow sidewalks due vast network bike lanes taking lot space. Stockholm relatively less dense. Finland Norway MUCH less dense. 

Culturally, upper Nordic peoples refer Danes ""the Italians Nordics"" Danes relatively gregarious outgoing, like hug upon greeting example MUCH rare Nordics. also LOVE party/go nightclubs, bars, restaurants imo closed soon enough. Danes super fun (not danes ofc, overall) probably part bit ass. know, figured taking break today something. spat **8** articles less hour. give days nice summer weather? really study figure out? Bought camper got really nice lot vacation resort country surrounded woods river 600ft door. Yard big enough nice garden we've got permission get laying hens. I'm taking sustenance hands. Joined party really early January started gathering supplies then. Masks, seed bank, guns, tons ammo, disinfectants, non-perishables, went bit crazy security offers unexpected amount relief. Buying second freezer week solar next week. frustrating supposed go back work conditions worse. What's excuse? I'm tired offices opening time passed want deal work home situation. want people back normal whatever fucking reason, even means ""lose them."" ""No sir, there's animals house. pet mouse look, tiny technically animal, right? Effectively, there's animals house."" he'll continue nothing it. love country. /s curious, Denmark mess badly compared Finland Norway?

Maybe population density. Finland 20 people per sq km, Norway 15 people per sq km, Denmark 350 people per sq km. disregard empty wilderness look capital area, Helsinki 1400 people per sq km, Oslo 1400 people per sq km, Copenhagen 6800 people per sq km. nothing, next door office employees COVID share everything; elevators, hallways, restrooms, service entrances, name it. 

Their office allowed close wasn't. Umm New York largely populated people brain dead like appears rest country is. Pretty sure New Yorkers would perfectly fine US anymore Regardless CDC says, common sense masks would help respiratory virus like this. seriously understand people defending wearing mask back Feb March, even supply PPE shortages wearing home made one since around then. People stupid hive mind dangerous. No. means: Since discussed months, means COULD known months, since subject publicly discussed, know means ""you know"". That's all.

Now ""is real not"". described many medical journals. yes is. you’re saying testing 100% true it’s disgrace. first incompetence it’s malice, president still keeps repeating less testing we’d fewer cases. words describe depravity haven’t already said. 

I also agree Cuomo’s response later pragmatic mostly responsible, came terms reality. 

He still late reluctant shut schools public events mandatory mask use order came like 2 months it.

Once spreading Italy Spain, obvious anyone paying attention, particularly anyone getting paid pay attention working public health anywhere particularly New York, testing not, thing everywhere. Regardless incompetent federal government agencies saying.

A bunch developing countries way quicker institute mandatory distancing, mask use, cancel events school etc, even though nonexistent testing capacity time. 

I maintain early Cuomo/DeBlasio actions universally reviled federal government extraordinarily incompetent anything seems competent comparison. 

It’s hard argue say Arizona states day ignore science reason.

It’s better Arizona Florida Trump isn’t something proud of. 

It’s like saying I’m great guy cause don’t beat children heroin front them. love seeing this. Please blow big Pharma water. Go India Go! Yeah, lot places shut virus really reached them, evidence ground says virus big deal, destroyed economy reason, etc. Well like need army defend Canada Mexico, Antifa, anything past attacks like kamikaze.

So... national crisis would happen army incapacitated months/years ? crisis would countries, think ? Players learn exponential growth, hospital infrastructure overwhelmed, social distancing works etc, interactively. 

Contact know health org that's interested. think could help lot people better understanding situation. Many Swedish officials baldfaced lying lately (saying excess mortality lately) good Statistics Sweden publishes report telling like is. ALSO really good (and true) excess mortality *is* decreasing. DeWine broke zip code. thank friends near Dayton Cincinnati fuckup. Meanwhile Cleveland still looks great pro profit party organized? thought toirnament humanitarian feel close minded. assumed policy place. Feels like people fighting good fight leadership outliers. Restaurants leaving open fans people dining inside. top everyone else said, still catch illnesses time polite continue wearing mask regardless. hope wearing becomes normalized stop passing many germs around. time life know 2+2=4.  taught fact, studied subject called ""addition"".  People (yet) learned subject, usually know fact. 

This research. teaching. 

Some people learn less quickly others.  people stupid. uninformed. mention put family risk. wife also positive Covid-19. Luckily kids tested negative. inexcusable behavior. Masks (even non N-95) protect wearer infected. person contributing regurgitating misinformation. treatment weird inflammatory syndrome kids, UK anyway said expected fatal days treatment. read yesterday, kids really happy read that. virus losing battle moved on
 
It makes sense political candidate, political leader ignoring pandemic terrible real-world consequences. Unfortunately world leadership role. North Rhine-Westphalia falling down. Problem that's awful lot people *not* living it. We've passed 9 million *confirmed* cases globally months, CFR 5% imagining immunity equivalent killing city size Dallas every year. *best*.

So hope case. Can’t really make things much worse!  Wel damn..how many people tested positive. MD case now, every store employee sitting front enforce signs indicating masks required enter. take going places? defense live America, live NYC. rates type damage occurs greater 0, current wave Redditors going around making secondary effects sound like apocalypse.

It's like 1% death rate gotten low, everyone latched next unquantifiable boogeyman drum fear.

People think reaction American right bad.. bad people making bunch stuff left. Over-reaction virus drives over-reaction protocols.

The polarization conversation problem. Making shit line part problem.

Let's stick facts, rather making shit up. Hmmm...could mean something wrong before? Jet fuel melt steel beams though. issues determining facts fiction. probably inform every scientist expert world right they're wrong. 

Gee Autism crazy thing. Osterholm go covid info. check Podcast osterholm update. CIDRAP great source info. Fuck off. leave disease Mexico.  #Translation: 

The number deaths Sweden significantly lower May April year, according Statistics Sweden's preliminary statistics. mortality still high.


The preliminary statistics deaths updated June 18 year. Statistics Sweden compares average corresponding periods 2015–2019. levels higher average described excess mortality.


Statistics Sweden received information 8,865 deaths May, 1,669 fewer April killed 10,534 people.

- death toll May still high. killed 1,650 people average May 2015-2019, says Tomas Johansson, population statistician Statistics Sweden.


Mortality Sweden compared 2015–2019 23 per cent May. One must go back May 1900 see May month higher excess mortality compared previous five years. May 1900, 9,349 people died, 2,252 deaths average May years 1895-1899.


#May 2020 also highest total number deaths May month since 1900.


To compare different months, statistics deaths per 100,000 inhabitants adjusted months assumed 30 days. calendar correction, 82.9 people per 100,000 inhabitants Sweden died May. 18.9 fewer deaths April, killed 101.8 people per 100,000 inhabitants.


- highest mortality rate May since 2001. year 86.0 people per 100,000 inhabitants died May, says Tomas Johansson.


The statistics also reported Excel file region municipality, broken gender age.


More statistics dead published Eurostat database. addition statistics Sweden, corresponding figures several EU countries.

#Facts: Preliminary statistics


Statistics Sweden's preliminary statistics dead produced give quicker picture development corona outbreak, opportunity compare previous years. statistics reported weekends Mondays considered raw data. change new data comes backlog reporting, especially days publication.


Statistics two weeks back time expected change great extent. statistics previous years based Statistics Sweden's final observation register. persons known death date included calculations.


The statistics say nothing cause death shows many people registered Sweden passed away. Use sexy string pants, work better better sized way. testing relevant level March, can't use number far removed reality. Hindry likes ideal conditions created lab, reflective reality. /s Lol. Right. deadly misinformation. Still regurgitated months later. Unbelievable. Every COVID cases Vietnam already recovered. true. friend (40s) got son (18) test sites booked. CDC told assume get antibody testing couple weeks. people Facebook still talking masks stupid. Smfh surprising. Americans mainly drink part social custom likely go overboard clubs, bars, events unlike they're sitting home. Also drinking seen something spare income hesitant spending amid concerns involving whole pandemic. Best Coronavirus Tennis comment anyone ever make. Say confidence total 305,289 cumulative cases 100,000 new cases per day March. Haters gonna hate. Florida man never pretended like wasnt Florida man get go. One must take step back look awe perfection, despite results. Florida man absolutely flawless Florida man stereotype ever come close. 6/23/20, Florida man day. really hope case, working home incredibly miserable lonely someone 20s enjoys spending time coworker friends *Laughs 10th largest economy world* article discusses one employer Denmark policy, widespread policy among many Danish employers employee knowingly travels quarantine zone (aka place recommended quarantine upon return home Denmark) fired taking risk. 

So although technically Danes go Sweden holiday, strongly advised government (who can't *force* to) also risk fired job employer finds were. I’ll pray spared disease die guess didn’t pray hard enough deserved it. /s take single cough sneeze. Speaking enough - even breathing. cheers! Yeah NJ, NY, PA area incredibly well cases reopening, never see good news subreddit hope next zombie film makes fun idiots.


Millions undead marching city 

Akshually flu kills year

What fuck talking about? 

I'm saying flu deadly.

Dude 95% city like zombies. CDC overrun said cases like 300 million..

Well flu kills 60k year 

You know 300million greater 60k right?



I think must kind willful blindness 122000 covid deaths + innumerable complications survivors even asympto people far greater 40-70k deaths year US flu.

Nevermind excess deaths recorded CDC causes mysteriously spiked early stages outbreak recorded pneumonia... hard many understand. look stats. thing doesn’t make sense timeline takes symptoms appear protests started. still plenty people don’t take seriously proud protection far preceding protests. could wrong I’m definitely expert, think resurgence late opposed protests also realized government next nothing support lockdown arrogance what's getting me. true case.....my son actually gives way longer hugs 🤗and plays talk said, relied German scientists (Von Braun). certainly get moon exclusively European talent, implying that's dumb.

As Sweden's government confirmed theme parks granted exception restrictions large gatherings, industry warned move cost billions kronor.

That means trips Stockholm's Gröna Lund, Gothenburg's Liseberg, amusement parks cards.

Gatherings 50 currently banned Sweden, Monday government said exception would made theme parks -- decision came blow working industry.

""The government made weighted assessment believes easing restrictions actually occurred summer, suffice. responsible ensuring spread infection take Sweden,"" Interior Minister Mikael Damberg told TT newswire, referring change guidance mid-June allowed domestic travel symptom-free people.

  

""There many activities covered restriction. might water parks, concerts, demonstrations. Many groups wanted exceptions,"" added. 

For Parks Resorts, owns Gröna Lund, Kolmården, Furuvik Skara Sommarland, message enormous consequences.

""As societies open more, long time preparing open restrictions line recommendations, done neighbouring countries. really believed open,"" group's CEO Christer Fogelmarck said.

""My thoughts go thousands young people get summer jobs. Parks Resorts Group expects lose one billion kronor sales year,"" says Christer Fogelmarck.

Julia Vasilis, information manager Liseberg amusement park Gothenburg, described decision ""surprising, frustrating sad.”

""During spring early summer, anticipation announcement [allowing theme parks reopen], risk analyses conducted number measures taken reduce risk infection. Everything fewer visitors, digital queues different hygiene measures,"" said.

""We taken enormous steps believe open safely. countries Europe opening plan theme parks, thought would get positive message too. expected.""

Not amusement parks affected way, depends capacity way site run. Zoos covered Ordinance Act sets 50-person limit.

This means example Kolmården Wildlife Park open visitors limited number tickets available per day, Astrid Lindgren's World Småland, Furuvik zoo amusement park Gävleborg, sites introduced restrictions, social distancing measures, updated hygiene routines.

Interior Minister Mikael Damberg said understood difficulties facing industry, theme parks alone this, pointed government aid crisis-hit businesses.

""We implemented large financial support package reach many businesses affected. Clearly, understand sectors suffered severely throughout pandemic due 50-person limit,"" said Damberg. Wait see Please cite actual source claim 100,000 new cases per day UK. Yeah that's true read article doctors saying *thousands England* permit lung damage, they're talking world, they're talking UK. UK 300k cases. Health correspondents journalists. need get information somewhere. guy cite source ludicrous claim ""estimated"" 100,000 new cases per day UK. Bad example considering commercials injected millions dollars funny. product. droplets evaporate leaving behind airborne droplet nuclei. quickly presence air conditioning, air conditioned air dehumidified. right thing people actually wear masks widely properly vigilant social distancing. Currently seems like maybe 1/3 people live even wearing masks, pretty much everyone given social distancing. really show link covid mortality mask wearing meaningful way, that's point. shows correlation, way makes plausible spurious correlation caused misspecification model. can't throw dataset statistics software, run regression variables call day. that's exactly looks like. Floridian frustrated lot Floridians yeah. doesnt help Governor really downplaying everything. Better late never lol... give pass states first hit. states 2 months look days prepare. Fear freedom! offer wearer protection. He's wrong spreading deadly misinformation. simply wants change focus virus election (hopefully) recovered economy. knows Biden mentally fit ti handle debates knows economy cannot stay state long. virus losing battle moved on, purely political things politicians. also don’t think it’s protests parties went city-wide afterward. many people age group went posting BLM marches posting playing beer pong friends later evening. key. Viral load makes huge difference why, instance, outside among others better inside extended period time. ""nothing weekends"" speak? 

What kind adult nothing do... ever? *Cries Swedish* never class 30 college. 225 absurd sounds shitty Zero evidence aside spikes mean. acuse everyone disagree political? I've said single political thing, everything I've said modes transmission  stick quick comprehensive lockdown though. Certainly live (state active Covid cases) we're still pretty stringent regulations, though they're easing more. believed genetically selected I'm glad. Sure anyone catch thing, capacity logic independently objective thought vulnerable. silver lining die first foremost, heartbreaking lose many best brightest undoubtedly perish wake also die trying help donkeys. Here's docs, nurses, first responders researchers.  It’s really frustrating countries gone Sars clearly showed this, yet until, don’t know, *two months ago*, reputable news sites government advisors saying “masks? Nahhhh necessary!”. 

It’s unbelievable Legend going 90mph. please It’s super fucking ability respond haven’t allowed states close borders. know it’s constitutional issue countries similar provisions preventing control domestic travel got around exceptions public health crisis.

The way going end well isolate states even cities highest concentration. #1 proven way control disease outbreak centuries. 

It’s going get pushback, domestic travel controls need happen sure BBC counted 190 unaccounted excess 9 Mar - 17 May, count significant.

If number added May 17 total, would 4.76% increase.

If current total increased percentage, would 5,355. increase 243 deaths.

Hell, food fuel prices went 4.76%, people would call significant. think major reason country requires masks, also enforce effective measures. Also third world countries( like somalia USA) can't require citizens use masks many simply poor afford basic necessities like clean water insulin masks question. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 3 types people: always trust authorities, always think government lying them, look scientific studies faced suspicious claim. 3rd category got right across CDC phases. really hope people start fact-checking often, trusting particular authority rather looking empirical evidence. studies showing masks slightly reduce chance viral infection done decades became politicized, like disappeared CDC agree. Oh crap hadn’t thought that. would totally character him. Anti intellectualism always rampant. You’re romanticizing past highlight reel explanation mask catch particles exhale yourself.

The mask catch hold onto particles. regular masks actually block particles, effectively like right next everyone who's breath managed catch. Yup. plenty producers willing take advantage them. you’re implying did, that’s incorrect. Statistical studies like don’t look causation, correlation needs established first. compare data different variables, case mask wearing number covid cases. statistical test determines whether link two variables strong enough reject chance explanation. Publishing study like means link widespread mask wearing lower covid cases, person replied said it’s perfectly possible causes overall competence. 

If read study, you’ll see mask wearing one many factors established statistically significant correlations covid mortality. think least part mask visible reminder pandemic. see someone wearing mask tend keep distance bit anyway. Plus they're endorsed authority figures tends encourage taking measures seriously well. People want wear mask would come something else. Even say masks didn’t work, would hurt? resistant comply something simple? taught cover mouth cough sneeze, since hands couldn’t adequately don’t want touching faces hands, use mask? people mind numbingly regressive hurts think about. can’t agree masks could ever agree on? info vaccine? long self isolation last? us quarantined completely voluntarily.

The government merely recommended it, instead enforcing law. kinda be, adult society. NewEgg sells them. several boxes. Note, however, fit well rounded ones. triangular ones leave little space bottom me, meaning, covered air escapes. Trying find solution.
They 40.00 30, including shipping. poop inside. Wow it’s almost like common sense directly addresses current issues. 

Good thing lots that. It’s common, right? surprising see people backgrounds actually abide it, government mandated requested people cover mouth nose, even can't offered mask use kind cloth cover. 

But rosy... lots people cover mouths nose people outright refuse wear kind masks. Swedish Public Health Agency even [advices joke content thread though. agree points, social distancing, mandatory quarantine effective citizens value freedom higher greater good. like imagine trajectory germs, chat guarantee, forehead chin, you’re covered spit. hard get commercial pilots license tbh

We've definitely seen increase cases opening back economy Texas Florida poeple going beaches California. we're month BLM protests there's far zero evidence BLM protests correlating increase cases state. That's ""being defensive"", that's reality. ignoring reality spouting political nonsense. ""It's airborne."" - China FEBRUARY

""What!?"" - Everyone else June People also fucking paranoid. I've seen cases people look like they're literally scared passing close someone get past grocery isle.

Look, walking next someone two seconds would get infected, entire world would already infected. 
As saw asked mean hoax video keeps getting pulled everywhere? North Korea hid coronavirus breakfast cereal Edit: link YouTube video doctor months ago ventilators link Politi Facts fact checking video valid. Tube well taking false videos sad. It’s awful sad see collective madness, willful ignorance science.

We [USA] good run leader free world. What, like 65 years so? bad. confirms cope pandemic, gradually grind economy institutions. pseudoscience propaganda running half show, don’t see us ever returning normal. young people willfully get properly self isolate, expecially summer immune system best might even worst idea government recommend mask usage symptoms, people scared shitless regardless virus wearing masks regardless symptoms not. Vietnam done phenomenal job contact tracing, social distancing quarantining people. I'd say masks relatively minor part issue. I'm Florian Kohlfeldt. getbto picture? Australia New Zealand. Neither required masks. differences China's cover up.

Sorry bring China discussion I've worn respirators dust masks hundreds hours.

They terrible things load moisture within minutes. boils leadership issues. saw Twitter drive testing CVS self-administered test? confirm / deny? Getting ur constituents protest times pandemic horrible idea. attitude right going drag years countries eradicated it, nearly so. He's never come problem solve bragging throwing money much worse this, since people typically get tested symptoms manifested gotten bad considered test-worthy.

The lag back Mar 2 weeks exposure Testing I'd expect lag 20+ days (2.5 weeks) given extra delay.

So, say - exponential growth locked well 2 weeks now. Drove past park today, saw group kids parents looked like baseball practice park, almost masks. went NYC AZ middle March. single check kind 2 flights masks much rare.  

I find hard imagine semblance enforcement occur, honestly. They'll living here, studying, probably age group risk serious problems. fine. Yes I'm actually sure mechanism sterilization here. argument worrying wireless communications (in particular 5G) lives non-ionizing part spectrum. mechanism radiation giving us cancer essentially: energetic electron bumps DNA hits hard enough turn ""cancer"" switch on. amount non-ionizing radiation enough flip switch, discrete event. assumed mechanism similar light based sterilization -- flip virus RNA switch ""do virus stuff"" ""don't.""

It might thermal guess. virus apparently stand well heat. I'd probably want look depending that. Currently plan leave mask alone multiple days anyway, academic me. feel ya. gonna grad school really good option delaying/reconsidering. I'm pretty sure future see drugs help critical patients reduce mortality rate subset cases. others, developed pneumonia historically much prevent secondary infections. effective treatment preventative treatment infected people unlikely. Well obviously Watch Plandemic changed nothing problem stayed same. 

You can't explain that. great mom handling US India, much stricter fashion. Watch Plandemic also use hydrogen peroxide mist sterilize best home conditions. put sun first. family refuses wear mask shouts ""They work!"" see wear mine.

They say wear because:

* uncomfortable/Cant breathe
* work
* We're sick
* get it
* get it, bad

Basically, ""If can't see it, happen happen, someone elses fault, mine.""

The majority people also planners/preppers. people focus living today real regard future. things today would protect future threat think useless lot people want immediate results. 

They care *they* sick. find something else blame. depends handle capacity, think. Waiting long lines, indoors, dont move often? Yup. far appears they're cautious timed entries, distancing markers, etc.

The rides themselves, I'm hard time thinking one it'd unsafe they're short, lots conflicting air currents, typically, and, loaded COVID mind, need right top people even car them. Many rides also outdoors part.

Also, said elsewhere thread, Universal Orlando, least, came smart ways make even eating outdoors safer - servers bring food wearing masks tray covered completely. put tray uncover customer removes cover retrieves food, wait staff retrieves tray. Many people gone said level care thought extreme side, be.

People forced stat indoors, places work closed. US deaths still coming (for now) Lockdowns seem ""work"" degree places already saw heavy levels infection. Don’t states think it’s over. Always wear mask always social distance worry mate. enough Darwin Awards go around shit kicks proper. time game. That's terrible source, basically random shit, link actual source general, ever quote Expressen source lul definitely want whatever reduce initial viral load, correlation large initial viral load severe disease. liberating philosophy adopted ""Humans stupid.""

Why furious, be? Negligent homicide? Watch Plandemic heard people say that? That's confusing. Using mask incorrectly increase one's chances getting virus (assuming overall risks getting virus relatively high) pretty hard. What, taking wiping nose outside someone sneezed directly face??? Hah. Tengele vet ju att man inte behöver masker believe mass crowding spreads infection? so, contradicting yourself. timeline matches exactly. Incuation period 2 weeks. Right effects protests felt. California huge protests, guess else happening here?

Anyone saying political defensive. everything political? That's reason we're mess begin with. people listened science things would bad, ""no, dare strip freedumz!"" Sweden personalised state leadership like Bolsonaro Trump. discord inside swedish political circles time whether good idea run like whether passed point return restrictions would matter all. Talking nation states like persons distorts view decisions made. Half people opposite government tell half told. What's differences China's cover up.

Sorry bring China discussion. Time switch Virginia beach lol live NYC. program bullshit. Mayor governor. Fucking joke.

96.240 Denmark period. found total 265 new cases week. number infected goes due increased testning.

Yeah, Sweden, Florida, Texas... countries handled seriously. contrary tests do, lower positive rate.     
Also, Sweden need increase test much tested enough right beginning. Instead saying ""you need tested come China Italy, symptoms, risks numbers decreasing, seen weeks period.

This poor reporting. observation definitely recommends follow up, however mechanism immunity require antibodies remain indefinitely. code production written memory cells. immune system adaptive, mean blood contains cocktail antibodies every disease ever exposed to. 

Antibodies dissipating post infection downright normal. lockdowns. all. UN, WFP.

And reasons lockdowns likely cause harm good well. Imagine working wall mart every three days work 30 300 brand new people. Sometimes hold hands, hug them, pretend fight them. Sometimes it’s building AC ton smoke. people put makeup you. touch clothes constantly. 300 new people never saw before, every days. bosses know they’ll never see again, don’t really care get sick.

Next time possibility compounded system might come make worse..

Its perpetual roll dice Citation please. available literature found indicates mutates much, much slowly flu. flu special regard, know virus family would characteristic. I’m Lombardy safety measures pretty much every region. Ever since lockdown completely lifted preventive measures masks inside stores shops social distancing.

Social distancing isn’t taken seriously pretty much expected masks used since can’t get stores don’t one. far know girlfriend tells (she's Lombardy), things pretty much alike rest Italy terms mask inside/on public transportation masks outside highly suggested, mandatory, especially keep distance. think indoor places allow masks inside restaurants, pubs cafes, opting outside tables possible restricted number customers inside. thinking made post?

""I'm going go spout shit without knowing I'm talking about""

??? hypocritical state time deeply affected relative infection death rates *entire rest country* relatively unaffected wet pants *entire rest country* wanted control spread making stay were, follow months later (after disease spread nationwide) ""reverse quarantine"" thereby prohibit entry *everywhere else* suffering disease NY refused assist containment of.

We *should* quarantined New York. delusion coronavirus outside NY came form NY, state (probably city) disease rampant common sense dictates attempt control spreading elsewhere. 

All people think helpfully clarifying pointing difference quarantining state prohibiting incoming travel state, *we understand difference*, anger we're *confused*.

When wanted maximize chances safety protect people, New York said NO, need leave disease infested state shall infringed upon. New York know rest us felt, even really disease deadly now.

The whole attitude summed ""Good thee.""

Every state blocking cross-state travel whole time. Exceptions could made essential travel maybe compassionate reasons. Every state able want today--except New York. required consistent logic used them. 

Not IDEA anybody would want go there. day still twice number active cases state places second category ten times number active cases majority states.  still rank #10 daily new cases. They'll almost certainly see uptick open more. Maybe sham delude NYers thinking somehow better country cases go back blame everyone else.

I used love NY much former resident. I'll show much compassion understanding showed rest country March. None. Shut volley, would seem. think good thing since think Sweden done little combat virus?

If theme parks would allowed open would thought bad. every morning think... 'things petty bad world'. always think again, worst *so far* mention ICU cases 115 (-12 today) less 20K active cases country (+1064 recoveries today)! Yeah that’s weird. may limiting testing high risk demographics, positive cases detect likely hospitalized. states also bit fuzzy covid patient hospitalizations vs general hospitalizations. Gardaland Italy already open since 13th. doubt either. asymptomatic, unlikely long term consequences, cases general. looking hospitalized cases, might them, might higher 1 3. people never hospitalized, also lasting issues continue affect health lifetime. However, noted possibility know true number long time years later numbers determined.

Pretty big news. Sounds like it’s confirmed Oxford and/or Moderna vaccines work, hasn’t made public yet. italy sending good luck need enforceable. 

If issuing quarantine means 25% people follow 25% decide travel here, reduced state spread 50%. 

Not everything needs nothing. Chip away things little little end reduced Rt number. 

Its like saying taking temp checks doesnt stop spread shouldnt done - stops fever spreading it, youll reduce spread potential. Wrong-o, shit left building Easter. /s scientist ever said : im scientist ...are okay? LOL, Trump's fault, course. surprising. Well, Japan ""magical"".

Any state country requiring quarantine (or outright banning) travel states festering virus ""smashing curve"" they've achieved undone state incubates internally begins export it, especially states open they've controlled spread, attract people areas containing virus well. Ok, test more, higher population density, testing 0.7 percent, rather Florida's 10.9. Florida end line. Can't go south. buddy use say that's ""Florida Mans"" end here. left go. Look, walking next someone two seconds would get infected, entire world would already infected.

That's it. That's whole conspiracy. Circulated central air buildings especially. heat makes less likely wear mask (at least properly) due even uncomfortable. see place Indiana. pretty damn hot outside tons people bothering wear masks wearing chin barely covering mouth, nose free wind. need end punitive jailtime. America many people jail.

Also PEOPLE JAIL STEPPING OUTSIDE HOMES!!!!*** aware deaths spiking right? measure “volume alcohol”? I.e. metric measure? quants know take sample size extrapolate. use tools used normal conditions measure metrics abnormal conditions. much macro statistics incorrect. 

I guarantee account alcohol sold mom pop shops - solitary drinkers buy booze from. Oh fuck plenty countries similar strict even New Zealand. How's authoritarianism? it!!! Anyone comparing spread COVID-19 SARS MERS

They comparable, they're coronaviruses, mean acknowledged that. Also rational assumes whole lot. true needed time around, did. 

I'm sure mean, US failed lockdown fast enough, failed get people wearing masks even taking basic precautions prevent spread virus. we'd handled better we'd much better (as counties already are). we've proven collectively containing outbreaks something reasonable without drastically affecting economies world,

A global pandemic going drastic affect economy. That's optional, reality. Failure contain outbreaks manage spread virus prolongs harm economy lives. COVID-19 last pandemic world sees. certainly can't repeated indefinitely vaccine may ever come.

You need vaccine get spread virus control. counties already there. safely reopening. Sports teams playing. still vaccine either. think country half-assed response, reopened everything safe, ignored medical scientific advice means getting virus control impossible without vaccine. 

A vaccine would still great have, point I'll settle adequate PPE healthcare workers general public, improved treatments patient outcomes, better testing, information scientists best reduce spread virus, reduce risks vulnerabilities improve odds catch virus, greater understanding virus body long term effects. ran back bunkers  realize Fauci cannot possibly things vaccine work. Nobody can. early. 

Fauci also slew terrible predictions past. 3 months ago telling people go ahead take cruises. predictions HIV 80s also pretty awful. stellar track record. So, Trump fucking media, else new? 25 percent country thinks hoax. We’d suprised many overweight families show up. news reporting obituaries prominently.

You clearly dont understand rural america still wilderness. throw someone civilization true wilderness without basic skills (and sometimes even ""dumb hillbilly"" masters) needed gear(not need modern gear 🙄), probably going die. several cases throughout history. many fact, I'm going waste time listing them. Look yourself.

This conversation over. nice life. Way prude ruin otherwise good joke. I'm sure hoot parties. (For clarity im blocking you) get covid 19 March, would huge anxiety mess! Thankfully, got feel stressed anxious. chillin hope everyone safe. Totally agree, went walk downtown friend mine, streets busy, loosely distancing, one masks. couple older persons saw masks noses. friend carried mask refused use whole time together. sense him. Ridiculous cavalier attitude. friend owns extermination company. leaving one pros. perspective, Texas California countries, would top ten globally new cases, rate growth, actually potential top five point next week. significantly higher total average positive returned test rate can't even say caused protests. low returned positive rate. I'm saying possibility long term lung damage study look like best resource prove it. 

It's survey 1600 coronavirus patients (although 43% never actually diagnosed coronavirus) 95% say still issues day day activities 3 months later. issues limited lung/breathing issues include headaches muscle pain. 

It clear respondents found. source article Dutch rely translated version. mentions organization Longfonds ran survey contact Facebook group ""Corona experiences long-term complaints"" (Corona ervaringen en langdurige klachten). Additionally states poll ""stems coronalongplein.nl"". front page site says (translated again) people lung complaints (persistent) lung complaints recovery information possible new lung disease, meet fellow sufferers share experiences via questionnaire.


It seems like survey, especially questionnaire mentioned site, might biased towards people experiencing long term issues coronavirus thus useful determining likely issues really are. months, keep mind vaccine likely grant temporary immunity permanent vaccines like Moderna’s, Sinovac’s Imperial’s manufactured 3: trust cops overstep boundaries yet want every random Tom, Dick, Harry given authority police others?

All ideas serious flaws, one glaring.  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/s7Tz3) America, medical treatment costs money. know goods traded EUROS well, USD. Chinese Yuan pegged dollar, Euro Fauci medical community fucked once. keep insisting LIED proof that. earth would even going churches severely immunocompromised? zero said. comment replied said ""we've never put much global resources vaccine!""


That nonsense. certainly idea means vaccine emerge year wishcasting.

I mean know reddit narrativ "" Taiwan South Korea best USA acting like 3rd world country"" dominant one , ranking certain scientific view, comparing numbers worldometer use determinate better (which straight dumb). wish could upvote this. I've ranting tribalism late like mad-man.

The extrapolation many world's problems germane. can't get people wear masks, we're doomed address environmental problems plague planet.

I place lot blame various dumb-dumb leaders running place, we've also got look mirror see they're symptoms population many ways.

Our ability reason downfall. forgot wasn’t patriots anymore. Yes. I'm referencing trip Home Depot Michael's curbside pickup 2 days ago. Parking lot full, constant stream people walking out, 5% wearing masks. fucking nuts?! I’m fan Cuomo seriously don’t see difference federal government threatening deploy military domestic soil enforce one style lockdown, state government telling visitors stay hotel 2 weeks? Around that. Keep mind vaccine created grant temporary immunity permanent vaccine discovered. vaccines, like one produced Imperial College, require testing **The EU go fuck itself** \- say sovereign nations issue.

There restriction Americans - nationality - flying Ireland. close borders stage pandemic plans now. 

And, even test Covid airport.

It's even consideration mind just....not come....because selfishness.   seems he's done disservice us calling Trump bullshit.

Imagine world Trump’s original cabinet played game Fauci playing, don’t Barr AG. 

You’re falling trap letting perfect enemy good (or case, less bad). 

What you’re advocating would put Fauci replace someone worse. Someone would onboard reduced testing. Someone correct I'm wrong, pretty harmful US economy?

Sure looks like lot economic challenges coming up. glad country run yugely successful smart businessman totally never failed gone bankrupt. got one highway it’s like 20 miles long. go. SERIOUSLY . got tested Covid-19 yesterday I've mild symptoms. Sneezing, coughing, tiredness, headaches.

Ever since started thinking getting test, I've phantom symptoms due anxiety (like shortness breath know anxiety among things) I've wracked anxiety general want put life hold two weeks, especially interview. I'm really hoping get phone call next two days (they call results positive). Honestly yeah, come relatively poor Eastern European country thought paying testing treatment running joke Everyone ""The South"" Alaskan.

Since believe virus continue infecting people indefinitely never stop spreading.   Sorry, point best-case scenario already much worse that.

As yesterday, rolling seven-day average new cases already 4,000, grown almost 100% past week.

The best-case scenario point might plateauing 10K day. Back March, rate growth fell quickly part people changed behaviors pretty quickly. point seems much greater resistance behavioral change. we'll see. I'm Dallas, nothing city, lmao 150 includes pre-clinical uncommon number. odds still higher fail. Dude nothing New Yorkers city probably 97% will.

Also, one reasons lag Sweden possible go back find Covid-19 related deaths. done several countries.

I've also noticed several sites uses 10 097 867 population Sweden. official number 10 345 449. true number probably 10,5M. lot EU citizens living working Sweden. Also many people without papers. Äh ja eh mean yes yes grandvaters. yeah thats less point. mean month old research based ten patients duplicated?

Hm? There's least 2 different papers going around detail damage virus asymptomatic carriers... sure ""month old"" objection matters CT Findings Cases Cruise Ship “Diamond Princess” Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Inui, MD1; Akira Fujikawa, MD, PhD1 ; Motoyuki Jitsu, MD1 ; Naoaki Kunishima, MD, PhD1 ; Sadahiro Watanabe, MD, PhD1 ; Yuhi Suzuki, MD1 ; Satoshi Umeda, MD1; Yasuhide Uwabe, MD, novel coronavirus pneumonia patient outside Wuhan: value CT images course disease Lina, Yuxiao Dinga, Bin Xiea, Zhujian Suna, Xiaogang Lib, Zixian Chene, Meng really holding running around telling people know talking about...

Please let know better newer research contradicts papers. Also, send abstracts trouble accessing academic papers, since clearly academia medical/scientific research. 

Hope helps.  Reminds Replacements movie, much darker.  don’t personally subscribe notion must wear mask law. believe choice.

Hawaii says whats 1500 remember well, large number patients whoncouldn’t even place ICU wouldn’t last seconds NY. reason subtract 100%... go 22 100 die 17 100, literally 5 additional survivors 100 statistically speaking. N 219 something kinda coincidence think. exploratory nature. 


And 100-22 78 87 btw hahaha. Ezekial Elliot already tested positive it, speaking future HOF players. Also, right, players like James, Giannis came it, ended lung damage, imagine would NBA. need live long enough vote people owned masks home didn’t even wear them. mom already N95 due smoke wildfire years ago wouldn’t wear it. 

I hope somebody government explains much PPE donated China February knowing supply shortages US. surplus masks sent overseas turn around tell citizens wear them? Wow. Ok then. saying still right want asshole it? Nah won’t granted disability. country least. system wouldn’t allow it. Yes. started playing 2016. long movie, unfortunately. Good. already discussed Please also refrain editing titles - post titles need match actual article. think technically still power commandeer vessel British waters.

Would hilarious ever decided use it. “There's still lot understood new inflammatory syndrome kids getting too.”

This comment alone shows you’ve swallowed media pill hook line sinker. number cases statistically insignificant stop world education mad. It’s like you’re smart you’re missing point. It’s filtering air breath in, it’s reducing amount medium large sized particles breath well distance travelled. won’t stop transmission reduces rate even small amount really cut spread.

It doesn’t perfect effective. Sneeze guards salad bars reduce transmission disease blocking 100% transmission. sneezes get people get sick it’s lot less without one. 

More importantly, can’t “prove” something doesn’t mean isn’t true doesn’t mean isn’t worth taking action on. there’s decent evidence cost reasonable risk low it’s probably worthwhile.

RCTs also great predicting large scale public health outcomes real world dynamic complicated. You’re way fixated them. I’ll bet really tried could pull great examples public health outcomes difficult dispute spite unsupported RCT’s. 

You sound like engineer swears something won’t work opposite happens get frustrated look face declare must change specs variable didn’t take account, storm adjust formulas coefficients. Yes point progress defined singular person everyone else could going backwards. Dawg, NY worst death rate country. general, Boston particular, different breed folks compared rest country. That’s always good thing mind you, we’ve got reputation uptight even sometimes cold that’s unfair statement make. I’m honestly exactly sure is, definitely intellectual crowd definitely also think education plays role that. exact X factor I’ve completely given trying figure tho...I personally love city love state, I’ve traveled around bit always notice difference Bostonians, better worse, state I’ve to. It’s 100% ends spectrum even defies basic common sense. Even without looking trials, cultures masks face coverings norm regardless current pandemic. *that* effective disease still spread there? COVID, one readily transmissible pathogens know of, beaten wearing mask? 

The fact everyone assumed either extreme (you're science lover even take mask brush teeth, conspiracy theorist wear one sheeple know hoax) help. can't point obvious fact masks sole cause halting virus without grouped latter, self declared responsible science followers abandon everything else they've hung tissue nose. Yeah, cus that's worked well countries tried.... really depends mean overwhelmed. Hospitals NYC ran critical care doctors crit care trained nurses pretty quickly experienced nurses doctors different specialties fill in. Physical beds last thing run of. make beds want, staff hard produce. Make permenant even COVID. suppose clever jab lol? need upgrade software. It’s troll account think ""how wear them"" work. people choosing wear masks (whether ""can't breathe"" STILL think work) getting PROOF masks work. news needs explaining people countries eradicating primary change 100% cloth/surgical mask compliance 100% time outside home. People literally still know NONE news country one live in, disregard new scientific explanation masks work. They're stuck initial implications got ""only medical workers need masks"" ""wearing masks makes people touch face actually worse wearing one."" again, likely people think anything happens another country policy works another country possibly apply us US special snowflake, maybe telling works countries work anyway. ability screening doctor's office getting supplement prescribed social issue though. vitamin checked though white prescribed supplement low levels. Many minority communities doctor easily access would screen vitamin deficiency. confirm thing healthcare setting. Management want patients “scared off” employees wearing masks. Man, must suck. Unreal see subreddit entirely concerned virus downvote calling Fauci admitted lie public.

Not death tied lie, distrust authority it. era people already screaming fake news everything, makes shit worse.

And here, Reddit, sub coronavirus, downvoted calling official lie public. redditors defending lie unto themselves. RTC studies ever found protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections.

Here examples:

[Jacobs, J. L. et (2009) health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches. Face mask use HCW demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds.”*

[Cowling, B. et (2010) studies reviewed showed benefit wearing mask, either HCW community members households (H).”*

[bin-Reza et meta analysis 17 eligible studies. … None studies established conclusive relationship mask ⁄ respirator use protection influenza infection.”*

[Smith, J.D. et (2016) undertook meta analysis available studies face masks. identified 6 clinical studies … meta-analysis clinical studies, found significant difference N95 respirators surgical masks associated risk (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”*

[Radonovich, L.J. et (2019) undertook study healthcare workers assess relative effectiveness face masks 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed study accounted 5180 HCW-seasons. … Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks worn participants trial resulted significant difference incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza.”*

I'm intensely conflicted. one hand, hot summer, like knowing exactly kids are, like able play friends. hand, indoor exposure. kids volunteered they'd already tested COVID-19, tested negative couple weeks ago, nice, can't help feel like letting home would invite extra risk family.

Today, two neighborhood girls' mothers run errands left behind. hot day, asked come inside. Due personal experiences presence couple creepy adults cul-de-sac, rubs bit wrong leave children (age 10 so) outside without parent home least teenager watch them, reluctantly said okay.

They're playing one kids' rooms now, I'm trying swallow fear I've made mistake here. Looking real advice here. I've isolating family safety since daughter, wife higher-risk factors. kids tested recently, presumably safer-at-home thing too. overreacting? proceed here? One women's soccer teams issue. forfeit entire season multiple players tested positive part procedure re-start season.

Imagine multiple NFl teams dropping out...whats point? rate they're going? wont ""next time"". asked, think enough political sense know tell public it. Article says asymptomatic moment. Hot take: theme parks safer lot people giving credit for. recently Universal (long, irrelevant story) honestly felt safer grocery store. Proper mask usage ~95%, temperature checks every entrance, usually adequate distancing, attendance waaaay down. Contrast local grocery stores, mask usage ~10%, temperature checks, one gave shit distancing, attendance normal capacity. 

Don't get wrong, I've got loved ones work parks worried returning work, especially considering non-essential is. wanted throw experience there; take info will. I’m sure states exact same, yes disheartening. 

And no, it’s apples oranges. I’m comparing death toll two different states disease. 

I everyone loves hate FL, nobody talks awful job NY did. mind blowing 30k deaths people say gov great job? 

I never said everything ok even close ok yet. doesn’t mean it’s ok bash Florida like they’re next epicenter thinking direct consequence recent protests? 

No. Outdoor transmission rare. people getting sick?

TX opened 3rd week April. due that. That's exactly opposite said. worry, probably get another bailout 😣 Waiting Trump’s rants Twitter. Give badge. I've flipping assholes off. look back say ""tried everything could"" inevitably runs president. Cuomo stuck Covid-19 patients nursing homes, lied staying isolation pictures leaving house.....yet people still praise idiot reason. bet brother working CNN nothing it......1.. protesters never anything wrong, ever. Outstanding citizens. 100k people screaming packed together pandemic. PROBLEM. everything eat tastes spicy, could possible red flag? missed among others understand exponentials Masks pivotal. closures longer Italy France China, we’ve achieved nothing. Cool. Glad that. authoritarian force quarantine good entire society. opened 2 months ago. known incubation period approx 3-14 days...it proven well control except clusters. meantime goes Sweden. still deaths per week Norway total! guy troll Good.

Stop mUh fReEdUmBs shittin countries. Outside kind general catch term leaving house, agreed people sticking outdoor activities generally fine, people going indoor areas without masks causing problems. think seeing large gatherings protests conditioned people thinking anything outside houses OK now. entire EU? Earthquake Mexico, 7.4 live county NY cases. would like see people get quarantined come heavily infected counties! correct information.

.. biases work pretty clear, point 30% overestimation. still plenty data coming countries would let us know mass cover going on. media freely report going on. Great Britain made lot progress still far along much rest Europe containing virus. Europe done far better job have, silly deny point.

Were deaths reported countries? Probably. change situation ground now. obvious look hospitalizations far less people getting sick now. [This website Texas Medical several friends work various hospitals TMC - bear mind, med center near downtown.

The TCH branch opening Katy, suburb 30 minutes town ready access med center. go med center specialized treatment. Katy hospitals. way shutdown borders interstate travel, likely unconstitutional. Cases. Deaths still dropping. forgot important stats change every day sub fit narrative. I’m done arguing someone determined stay basement rest decade 🤷🏻‍♂️ Congrats. Also hard believe know 150 people it. know one. Also 150 close sample size cmon man.  He's obviously invincible virus scared him. make New York? Exactly. I'm thrift store junkie missed going immensely since whole thing started. Well, opened back two weeks ago gone back, long time. Why? feel safe. pick shirt like, idea else tried (and pulled right face, like I'll to) when. aisles ridiculously narrow stores small buildings can't really widen them. fitting rooms tiny would take air users (which would fun seeing one store two fitting rooms begin with).

There many risks involved. I'm high-risk, live two people age sixty terribly great health, either. want go shopping. really, really do. also want get sick get parents sick. that's always going takes priority, matter stores open. feel safe, I'm going, spending money there. things important preventing covid-19.

We agree best way avoid getting HIV sex, yet, almost us seem ok risk due benefits sex.

Edit: upon reading article, see room mates tested positive virus, continued march contact them. continued march symptoms. seems like criminal conduct. something similar transmission HIV intentional reckless infection person human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)” mask works. suspect numbers low Norway early measures wearing mask unnecessary. numbers spike (like parts US), I'd definitely wear mask close contact others.

*I jackpot?!?*

No, COVID-19!!!! Thank posting this. seeing lot ""the hospitalizations down"" people think ""Coronavirus must getting less deadly"" people trying pretty numbers November.

Here's one found Jacksonville yesterday: addition crap like posting places like Florida people like Scott Franklin (Who running Congress) want mandate masks town because: 

“Masks low-cost mitigation measure, nothing cheaper social distancing,” Commissioner Scott Franklin said. “I’m favor putting something place can’t enforce don’t stomach enforce."" 

Here's link full article: absolute fucking nonsense. 

The fact Coronavirus virus became political leverage done much damage. important people see understand what's really happening. hospitals filling lot people going die get shit together. wish would let people see what's going inside hospitals think would eye opening. Maybe people would take virus seriously. Believe me.. standing position life, gasping sightseeing average masses... 

When things matter, situation matters, become something never fail missinterpret...
and surprised sheep need hand? 

Everytime people forget evil evil... I'm entirely sure point was, point excess deaths, due law large numbers, accurate guess many people expect die monthly basis. Looking back time, clear trends however get 2020, expected number deaths much higher normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course deaths investigated, many likely COVID. However, people dying, even states shelter place orders. true deadliness pandemic like catching COVID, catching something ELSE COVID already (Or getting COVID pre-existing issues Diabetes, Asthma, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Heres 1 random source found: ohhhhh  ok added it. Got it. Testing contact tracing, like told beginning. guess works water wet.

So told people slow testing 🤦‍♂️ Pareto Principle true *every* exponential process. pure mathematics. u me? Clearly taking two week paid vacation months nothing except handing measly 1200$ is. Title leaves something desired it? Maybe takes two months slowly grow seems wide variance mask wearing - even within Southern California. neighborhoods great, garbage. still see lot ""no mask, service"" signs. no, conservative coworkers small town US say they're definitely open. Right now. makes look weak ineffectual able exposed get sick. virus going die off? people gotten colds. makes think stop low percentage? shown signs stopping. know dude, shame. Keep politics health education. to? holy hell even talking about? exploding right now! Exactly Arizona it’s better catching  family Hawaii - enforced there. lot easier find arriving Hawaii limited ports entry. - yes - one state worked. 

I friends Philly area said liquor beers stores closed early would try go Delaware buy booze Delaware troopers would turn around border based license plate. .. could stop speculating, get flashlight, start counting.. always assumed Ottawa Quebec reason. someone lives Quebec works Ottawa avoid quarantine? speculate he's soft virus partly wife owns salon Yea come china, hoarding masks. supply chains dry. time inventory could literally cops driving around marking state cars approached time cop sees plate state run possible ticket.

The State would need supply something passed quarantine avoid issue, cops lately think they're task all.

It work would need addition systems help make work. Japanese already wear masks. Americans politicized masks. Trust everything fauci says! Except goes sub’s narrative. long gonna consider? people visiting states like Florida Atlanta come back? Many already did? painfully obvious masks work. work, telling people buy economy verge collapsing. would saying know sure better safe sorry everyone mask up! combined told work buy mask shortage, obvious work enough wanted chance buy themselves. Unfortunately think Fauci sell bit soul work Trump Administration. sure felt shit baout probably thought apart 100% disaster ready go ship. Seems like many getting message now. Trump listening. shit seen heard mind bogglingly crazy. People listen neutered Trump pushed background. Patriot fan, I’ll always love Tom Brady football player. field health guru crap tho? much. lost lot respect made IG post back February trying play COVID-19, time really needed taking way seriously were.  dollar store tube masks, think tube top. cover much little want That's even sentence. bathrooms Massachusetts right. different, scarier type struggle NYC, appropriate draw comparisons places topic, nowhere else hit nearly hard. way compare, need support best can.

Everyone app phone tracking past movements current health status. get flagged get tested/quarantined. try go without phone. 1. Hope one snitches you. 2. Good luck business transactions places app payment based. cash only, bet nosey business owner point ask phone at. 


I visited Shanghai 2018. Can't even get drink vending machine required app figure activate. Luckily local guy nice enough buy one me.


I see degree tracking fly anywhere East maybe Southeast Asia. mandatory quarantine BC well: 14 days home entire household, recognizance. anyone found leaving home quarantine, quarantine strictly enforced. modeled NZ experience works. NYer here. I'm this, want irresponsibility others sending back quarantine... can't possibly simple. Doctors decide research gets funded. doctors might ahead curve, medicinal research pandemic gets done via large studies drugs used need fda approval. doctor NY prescribing something seems working, large scale study dump results into. studies also serve another purpose disseminating information doctors. 

Also, bullhorn like one found presidential podium. yeah, think 2 factors combined hurt us nation. Wait, restrictions inter-state travel US? Canada required 14-day quarantine time cross provincial border. assumed US would same, apparently not? responding ""like Herpes"" part. Herpes comes back actual virus. Post Polio Syndrome due damage virus (at least, that's best guess) infection. Coronavirus could cause long term syndromes, would know thanks SARS. Quality/stringency NPIs (lockdowns, mask compliance, etc.). New York quite well despite getting rocked April. regions US poorly (Texas, Florida, Arizona) locked much shorter period time populations take altogether seriously. Interesting [Politifact normal hospital bed usage NC Sen. Jackson says they’re normally 85% full. 

Basically hospital usage varies greatly place place season season, 76% occupancy doesn’t really appear abnormal. also used ""Ah, joke!"" line: Delaware State Police waiting border pulling anyone came state license plate. Granted, New York borders much larger, enforceable. live Washington DC. carry New York driver's license. friend also lives carries Florida license car Florida plates.

My friend would one many false positives system like this. particularly effective. article false then? Exact thing Canada. Gatineau/Greenville example. Thank honest. Hey guys I've found original superspreader /s I'm inclined agree them, see masks significant effect Sweden given society structured here. 

How society structured? everything outdoors everybody constantly 2m apart? not, wear masks. Weakness weakness.. need label differently.. need fear so..

I it..you probably..

Its ok threaten send nursing homes flu shot available upcoming season yet? Medium ""great"" ""source"" take away point, Florida one USA's populous states, 19 million people, little less *1/3* population Italy. 

But, make point even stronger, taking account population size, means Florida *30x* new cases Italy per capita. Really, really bad. 

Either way, things looking good Sunshine State.

EDIT: population Italy first. possible self-administer oxygen administer oxygen others equipment. Note thing hospital-grade ventilator home/ICU treatment. remember people New York sent home given oxygen help tide through. worked case currently serious, significant risk getting serious. bad thing virus people deteriorate rapidly (ie within hours) getting support trained health care professionals, die. started deteriorate rapidly, would unable self-administer ventilator. someone knew started deteriorate rapidly, want hospital. equipment hospitals, also highly trained hospital staff 24/7, ability adjust medicine treatments fly. enforced? Pure speculation.

You literally making shit right now.

You're problem. almost like know something dont Active positive virus. State saying lagging results tests done week ago currently higher. idea current infections mortality. know hospitals stating 85-87% current COVID admissions ICU. white, class privilege thing. devastating. education self awareness important. post ""news"", preempt reply said ""news"", reveal intact news all? Hey fuck I'm healthy low risk category. would sing test subject.

Information gathered unquestionably far valuable humanity potential inconvenience individual complications. *""mass achoo"" sits* poorly you? mans fucking joke I'm tired. work hospital, one coworkers nurse. wear mask around office, traveling North Carolina next week. One coworkers also like wear mask, 70 lives 90 year mother. breathe time think they're going get (and me) sick.

We work shifts see twice week, I'm exhausted, nervous. supposed do? office effecitively size closet. I'm trying think excuses work home nurse coworker office, still worry gets infected stay air. 

I try wear mask much can...I desperately want new job difficult get hired right now.   Yup, still state requirement New Jersey wear masks stores, salons, etc. Sales associates wear masks wear gloves. seen anyone shopping wearing mask, although small number noses. We're traveling coastal NC weekend I'm sure expect there. treason then? can't hide ambulance sirens constantly whizzing past climb exponential curve. what’s median age new infections (spoiler: it’s around 35 whereas initial wave 65). even remotely close danger wave hear things lockdown skeptics. ""Covid dangerous"" ""We need open everything NOW, virus damned"" ""Death rate 0.5% young people, see vague interpretation CDC prediction 6 weeks ago. Nevermind side effects dangers passing someone else."" EU's economic clout pretty damn close US's... centralized authority wield effectively. 

Also worth noting, US waay trade EU agree happen current situation.

Perhaps years downwards spiral, ever.  mean, there's little furious that... 70% trick. put clearly. Czech. worn months time go home car. wanted, made mandatory. Disliked fuck, glad get rid finally week.

They obnoxious, inconvenient, another thing keep mind on, wearing gets uncomfortable hell actually move and/or temps rise. honestly, really kind person actively seek discomfort inconveniences, enjoy them. Actually opposite, try avoid those.

And yes know help, certain special circumstances. come on, 0.09% IFR fro whole 0-69yrs group...

The biggest issue? vividly absolutely hate, despise oppose someone tells forces this, dont that, wear this, dont wear that. well remember shitshow wore KISS t-shirt school back days. 13 anymore somebody tell supposed dress myself. Keep mind tho, doesnt cover issue private property house rules. shop establishment demands wear facemask, comply go somewhere else. Free choice still stands.

Sure ask wear one. civil manner. right consider request comply similar civil manner refuse, decide want to. Simple that.

Hate much want. honest confession someone wear facemasks really thrilled them.  Okay, rest comment completely reasonable. it’s framed first sentence completely wrong. Julius Caesar fighting civil war, can’t fight civil war without killing people disagree you. showed posterity knew going around murdering everyone indiscriminately would make Rome ungovernable. However it’s rather clear “kindness” didn’t work given alive within decade winning civil war. Yes!!  realize many people administration stick around either make better eventually, think they'll replaced someone worse. Similar reasons people stay abusive relationships.   cases wearing seatbelt caused fatalities severe injuries, however statistical anomaly. difference opinions based accurate data interpreted honestly, opinions based anecdotal evidence. story overrides facts. Like sheltering overpass tornado true!

America already back 30,000 new cases daily, look like stop there. would surprised see 40,000 next week. Genuinely asking, what’s source number tests versus positive infectious percentage? Hawaii, easier Island State, see enforce New York. read article study seriously conducted comparing countries, result accurate all. ignored every factor pretended masks measures taken... case Universal Studios. parks capped capacity right now, rides walk ons. Team members constantly giving hand sanitizer letting rides, let remove masks. They're well ensuring reason another surge. super fuck even happening 94 140 people know exposed Covid give enough crap tested, fully knowing could spread around? seriously disheartening. read detail regarding story now. current infection risk, past deaths. anything, high death toll makes countries afraid second wave. know 80% spread made superspreaders. lot infected dead ends virus. shouldnt overstate example.

Properly equipped HCWs treat covid patients higher risk ppl. Hence possible make barbershops safe. last time Trump said anything Fauci? traveling shit control. Period.

There've several incidents people died rides pre-existing conditions Disney liable COVID probably different. even think family kid died alligator attack got anything one Disney. Yeah go three weeks whole blood donation. mostly want Power Reds I'm two inches two short that, despite otherwise excellent candidate. Obviously need stop admitting people hospitals. run room!

*taps head*  maybe wear face shield? 🤔 way see schools basically offer two tracks, either person distance learning, leave families decide want do. idea promoting distance learning families handle less kids school reduce potential vectors spreading virus, theoretically make easier implement distancing measures, family really want online schooling opt person. Again. course, Trump boot licker. We'll seeing lot headline. I'd happy countries decided people coming US quarantined. Norway US Brazil. acted responsibly. suspected antibodies different patient patient, natural patients experience better immunity due antibodies worse.  

My understanding vaccines work different way effective vast majority population. need details. Like okay ""none got sick""? test positive though? Australia, 2 week mandatory hotel stay returning travellers paid state. Would nice guys guns nazis breezed across continent. harder breathe symptomatic covid-19 infection, obviously. stupid question. substitute vaccine mediated herd immunity right. countries (and smaller areas city level) shown ability keep R values one education, milder restrictions, masking. replace herd immunity unless happens worldwide could keep spread least low talk vaccine mediated immunity 3500 new people actively sick include people got antibody test back positive sick sometime past Booster shots. things outside influenza need booster every 5-10 years. Covid-19 mutate anything like flu far tell, there's hope it'll fairly long lasting vaccine.

Also there's much evidence covid reinfections. everyone reported caught twice usually proven false positive faulty first test (tests never going 100% accurate)....

I'm saying reinfections can't happen do, super rare really happen severely immune compromised patients (HIV,Cancer, etc)  Calling China’s government competent gets upvoted shit.. you’ve gotta joking retire giraffe reflex hammer!!

Taiwan enforces 14 day quarantine successfully it, get $30/day stipend snacks. 30k fine. also gone 16% past two weeks ICU patients 11%. Hold meth pipe Can't get infected everyone around immune. Fauci said lied. wasn’t logical. Cloth masks help. assertion played cultural racism regarding masks - people could see Asians wearing television yet insist masks useless harmful.

Also don’t think math - take protection away 95% population protect 5% population wind greatly increasing risk 5% giving many infected deal with. don’t know enough statistical model cumulatively, time, math play favor privileged 5%. do.

Sounds like Florida Man male version Karen. agree. It’s good sign everyone tested didn’t get sick two hairdressers lots infected don’t shed much. need examples saying look amazing masks are, work perfectly (which people reading this).

OLYMPIA — Gov. Jay Inslee Tuesday announced statewide mandate requiring facial coverings public slow spread new coronavirus, cases begin rise Washington.

And Yakima County — [which nearly many COVID-19 cases state hospital capacity maxed — Inslee ordered even stringent requirements make sure people cover faces businesses.

The orders set take effect Friday.

The statewide mandate — formally issued State Health Secretary John Wiesman — requires people age 5 wear face coverings indoor outdoor space public.

While children 5 exempt, order recommends kids ages 3 5 wear facial coverings.

Also exempt governor’s order: people deaf hard hearing, specifically scenarios communicating another person.

And order recognize times allowable people remove masks, eating restaurant, engaged recreational activity either alone members household.

The new statewide order comes King County May issued directive [requiring face coverings County officials said wouldn’t enforce order either arrests tickets.

For Yakima County, Inslee went even further. governor set issue emergency proclamation specifically bar businesses operating, allowing customers enter business, unless customer facial covering.

The governor’s exemptions, however, also exist order.

Inslee announced Saturday would put place order masks Yakima County.

It comes health officials try get handle increasing spread virus county 255,000 people. Yakima County end Sunday reported 6,326 cases COVID-19, according state Department Health. Yakima County remains first, restrictive state’s four-part reopening plan.

Officials meanwhile trying keep infections across state businesses reopen phases [as part Inslee’s four-part recovery Monday, Snohomish County reported largest single-day number confirmed COVID-19 case since April 9. County officials announced total 75 new cases.

The better question would've left state. There's NY amongst rest world.

**This fucking scary sad...** Inslee kiss hairy ass. epinaoi They're protecting people sick yet. WTF guys still alive! Seriously, sincerely Australia. right move. Maybe 3 months ago true, we've bombarded since fact masks stop spreading it, getting it. point people refuse mask well aware risking people's health. Easy tiny island big brother everywhere. Every one papers taken grain salt.

Why? Serious injury, major inflammation, serious illness reduce Vitamin levels: mean Vitamin casual, merely side effect ""cytokine storm"" ravaging body. might that, sicker get, body reacts ""using up"" Vitamin supply. Actually back March remember seeing many black people claiming virus ""didn't affect them"" even goading asymptomatic black carriers go infect white people. 


So lot idiocy of: ""this Asian people virus"" ""only whites get it"" made lot people careless months.  Hmm... right way, cases asking people wear masks might appropriate mitigation strategy.

As said above, situation different elsewhere.

In month since made comment above, active cases reduced 4. We're testing 3% population month, would good indication community spread existed.

If authorities ask everyone wear masks now, there's infinitessimal chance actually interact infected person given day, vigilance fatigue would set long. actually outbreak (which will, sooner later), would difficult get everyone dial vigilance again.

In case, immune system startled breaks pancreas. almost like financial interest keeping hoax alive surprise? 
It always unrealistic approach. way herd immunity would achieved vaccination. 1.) everyone gets full face respirator.

2.) pump low level pepper spray throughout stores. 

3.) whatever fuck want, idiots.

Please make sure put money collection plate way out. tell coronavirus respect authority. scientists tell us would happen! never trust guys! Facts. good news 👏  making point. tests mean cases. cases used political weapon him. wants guess biggest common denominator states seeing surge cases right now?

States reopening memorial day. day**  heard? imply US medical experts made avoidable mistakes, makes Trump voter. Even American. lie? month? we're thinking thing, FDA allowed distillers make hand sanitizer ethanol, pose health risk methanol, what's stuff made Eskbiochem. live van river Again, individual guarantee safety indefinitely, unless live perpetually isolated rest world grow food water totally grid. There’s also lot people live state go physical labor..... spent month working earlier year. thin veneer Cuomo worship ending quickly started. Can’t wait someone looks earnest broke protocol mandated put coronavirus elderly patients nursing homes already extremely obvious everyone brain risky was. best incompetence lead thousands deaths. there's big holiday weekend coming up. /s  get tested times far apart they? wear mask properly. social experiment may science Trump ever participated in. didn't.

Do people reading skills? really understand keep reading this, rolling average new cases first week May (about 29K) back much harder get test without serious symptoms. Since time deaths cut half. would 29k (likely younger, milder) infections today equal deaths 29k infections 2 months ago? California state-wide stay home order March 19.  Cuomo refused follow California's lead whole 24hrs... statewide stay-at-home order NY came March 20.

The obvious problem lack testing total incompetence federal level. Without data, blaming local officials batshit crazy versus holding people responsible us blind. Im saying 25% 75%, 25% those. saying 25% 25%. example - wouldnt go 100% using 1 set people (ie everyone would traveled NY non covid19 situations) really, really want trust Dr. Fauci, covered Reagan &amp; Bush administrations early stages AIDS crisis, appears Trump. Yep seeing positivity rate town past couple weeks. pretty harsh. department health releases city every day, days high half days around 10%.

The problem *no idea* testing criteria are. One day get lot tests prison rates tragically high. next day, County tests employees working home. next day big spike cases hospital. ""testing blitz"" test people willing wait line 4 hours.

The thing data capture absolute chaos disorganization. making decisions *prevalence estimates* done testing statistically significant sample random people, city, regular intervals. That's meaningful data. nothing ""more tests means cases"", wildly biasing factors work here. Everyone speculating much confirmed case count correlates actual cases IFR, need follow established methods epidemiology test random. still offer widespread testing separate endeavor, takes 7-10 days get results testing useful individual.

My employer big testing blitz asked everyone come training room indoor antibody test. refused unsafe. around 250 people pass one training room morning 3 days - sent email directly HR contact point saying felt safety risk, got reprimanded response cc'd director told contact HR without approval. Guess can't speak apparent imminent safety issue. whole state feels like going mad right now.

Maybe president give reassuring clarity today calm things down. /s Yep, that's would work. They'd still end back states. So, what's point here?

The US many countries let people fly cases country. Guess we're whatever flavor conspiracy believe. quick way know drug expensive slow make large quantities checking ""-mab"" end - monoclonal antibody. great result, likely available small set people - still useful rather small fraction people develop cytokine storm targets. I’m wondering same, I’m traveling TX tomorrow family two weeks. NY decent tracing network set up. sure working practice, think there's like 3000 tracers city alone.  Hope goes well. blabs spews shit thought constantly lies suit room. can't take anything says thoughtful truthful. assume everything says self serving ass covering surprised! lies lies. know normally NYC 15 million tourists go every 3 months? 

You people came here, added crowd, go home spreading virus go back home proclaim virus fake packing bars. hell fooling? Coming AZ, much likely risk someone else yourself. Whether government required not, please get tested take trip. Meh need get better time now. I've never cut hair quick Google lead medium priced well reviewed Wahl clipper found good deal new one eBay. Watched couple videos cut hair home. That's need basic men's cut.

Husband told number guard usually asks went one higher case really fucked up. always go shorter. immediate disaster went back shortened it. Next time I'll ""the usual"" since feel it.

It takes minute figure hold things comfortably (and also went sheers point cut/blend/texturize after) BEST CUT EVER honestly he's much worse, bad first try.

Our 5 year old son next gave better cut I've ever seen him. messed one part back switching guards blending noticed right away bad enough wiff whole thing shorter, work blending mins. end week invisible. know always double check guards. make mistake again.

I nervous want mess hair went saying ""This might suck, ok shaving shorter usually go screw up?"" answer ""That's fine, best"" pressure off. bigger critic work either worked out.

Next time even better since actually know I'm now. Pennsylvanian, curbside takeout best thing come whole thing. wouldnt take advantage it? That's mind went. Looking first wave going spike cases time second wave comes would think less people infect rate US going. Hell know we'll riding 1st wave long even 2nd wave 1 massive long 1st wave. He’s seeing patients return symptoms weeks. I’m sure want say head physicians treating recognize effect virus. 

My point isn’t new unheard of. happen believe patients honest reporting recurring symptoms Nd it’s widespread imagination. trying convince anyone doesn’t want believe virus effects.

We know year.  Right, entire country opening back anything it, wonder southern states opened first surging much?  can't guarantee asymptomatic patient act stupidly/selfishly go public. safer remove family members asap whole family goes down. going Chinese papers news google translating back Jan Feb, sentiment seemed early intervention = better patient outcome.


So moment person diagnosed, get yeeted temporary hospital monitoring, guaranteed medical intervention case worsens. probably blood boy. Anyone experienced medical field: herd immunity develop without vaccination? long take? This. got COVID, long survived think possible could worse I've go mentally past four months. way I'm reading is, ""those covid hits hardest likely die."" mathematical model published one top biology journals discussing concept (they estimate 43% 25%, another preprint article back peer reviewed mentioned 25% number though)

 

It misinformation, also used direct policy decisions modeling.

Also whole concept herd immunity transmission would fail start percentage immune people, would slow down. herd immunity threshold point enough people protected new outbreak cannot take hold population transmission occur. see measles outbreaks anti-vax communities vaccination rates drop needed \~70-80% threshold see measles cases spread anywhere else country   genuinely great idea basis Presidents “war powers”. Chinese government, ""authoritarian regime"", mr CIAbot.

Chinese propaganda January: wear masks, quarantine, virus bad. Buys world's PPE supplies save Chinese people.

Western regime propaganda two months: masks work, go vacations, FLU! herd immunity BS inject disinfectant ChYNA BAD! flails badly acquiring PPE.

Listen one, actually live. Listen other, might die. obvious one credible people trust government more. 😋 Vietnam authoritarian too, seen anyone doubt number. China's death per capita ball park Korea/Japan/Taiwan/Hong Kong/Thailand. christianity

Gonna take bait ought visit Iran months come back see ""fundamentalist christianity"" root problems society link that? seen one link me. Thank much! think depends live country. That's completely true. studies early showed improper mask usage could increase risk infection.

Wearing dirty mask regularly touching mask face going make likely get sick wearing mask all. State delegated responsibility counties, since counties low counts high, county could implement based conditions ground. 

I believe counties pass criteria, reopening mandates safety issued state (and counties) generally quite good. However, many businesses following mandates, local enforcement agencies (sheriff, police, County health departments) aggressively trying enforce rules. With, I'll wear around neck. Vitamin doesn’t come sunlight, sunlight needed body create it. also get food sources. Lol. also slaves right? Wasn’t NY one complaining Maine etc we’re stopping people NY telling quarantine? may turned away can’t remember fair, really going tell us otherwise? doubt it, also don’t know effective much quantity available. Hopefully one works least bring slowdown virus. Enough safer life.

Just really hoping (Brazil) get decent chance vaccination/virus control, even current President charge. Poof! Yeah I've heard too. would explain kept salons open ""essential"" weeks stay home order. first thing open again. pretty heavily speculated certain governments told ""white lie"" masks better save stockpiles nurses doctors. Even though greatly erodes public trust. supposedly actually widely believed west statement true, even amongst doctors (until recently). live fairly rural area, recently first positive cases county. still next impossible get tested. course, overreacting wanting test ""just because"", coworker mine sick telltale signs finally tested she'd fever week+.

Still, wording Danish article makes wary.  Bartender South Dakota. Yesterday checked 3 New York ID’s. find odd people would want travel NY sure states thing? That's pretty bold claim say 'most states' manipulating numbers outright telling others stay quiet. think make statement I'm simply going pretend didn't.

Secondly, comparing entire state Florida which, still considerable travel state, nowhere near amount people travel single city NYC holds. Further, NYC densely populated metropolis, filled many people tightly packed together. entire state Florida poor comparison. yet, compare surge cases deaths state, bode well future Florida. 

Who's bashing Florida? mean, state. tangible thing. I'm bashing poor leadership bad decisions individuals. Never said that, say I'm flapping flapping . . . get anywhere. frustrating!

Basically Shi published genome RaTG13 Jan 20 paper published hundreds less significant divergent genomes bat coronaviruses years since RaTG13 supposedly first sequenced. __no evidence__ outside team ever existed samples conveniently got destroyed.

Why significant RaTG13 (if exists) clearly novel publication worthy virus right. never published _after_ outbreak COVID-19, especially Shi publishing genomes hundreds viruses Therefore, RaTG13 otherwise invalid epidemiological origin-based research studies, studies using genome part conclusion retracted unless independent third-party verify genomics original specimen.

The papers (there search) asking retraction scientifically polite suggesting might sequencing error poor procedure first place. 

The Occam's razor explanation Shi entirely made RaTG13 sequence early January provide support horseshoe bat origin COVID-19 .00 something Thanks good info, especially deaths age graph.

Interestingly, percentage deaths 50y 0.7%, lower Italy (1.1%).

Perhaps nursing home deaths Netherlands? said kills ""Covid."" SARS CoV-2. That's like saying kills AIDS, HIV.

And that's least ignorant thing situation.  “old folks” argument worse. Drives wall! What's Cru? right. Health always come first money. believe people take advantage CERB?  know people returning work said rather collect CERB, easy money.
What happens then? fault, moron wouldn’t shocked all. perfect transfer moment too. ton international students know families come US either thanksgiving right last finals early December.

A perfect wave unknowing victims bring US without even knowing they’re sick Sure did. overflow. Like inauguration. Literally spilling over. take open people's eyes? even possible point? Thousands thousands innocent people going die people consumerism shit This! ""hoax"" ""this covid-19 case count bullshit"" pushers going use finally agree(?) serious. racist way. already know say, work plenty them...  get around saying driving Alaska. Austin checking in. finally got go back masks required. Maybe they’re rioting spreading filth germs other? Yes, ICU beds billed higher. implying Florida lying ICU bed insurance billing?

What gets reported media gets sent insurance two entirely different numbers. Even Florida lying media ICU beds use can't lie insurance company flat fraud. one cares lie public going get caught lying insurance companies. Maybe autocorrect OC referring Orange County? American even heard case. Sounds like another case media overblowing it. can’t help think absolute truth. hit hard MA, taking exceedingly seriously. see friends neighbors get sick go work hospital stuck inside, willingness mask greatly increases. Says guy forced reopening everyone's throat. sure moved often true, contacting positive cases priority. ordered like 200 KN95s March even first lockdowns.

But preparation 2nd wave I’m upgrading P100s. still get Amazon like $35 plus extra filters. according friends wear work use filters WEEKS swapping out. Might want consider them, figure another month they’ll sold :(

The KN95s reuse 3-5 uses get funky. p100s think economical you’re using everyday. filters $16 buy bulk last weeks, where’s KN95s like $3-5 you’d go least 3 weeks. figure p100s protect better also save $ long run. worry fellow Texans, *if* get NYC levels disaster, maybe he'll something meaningful :) make campaign think people coming actually were. let anyone wanted go arena. Nah, that.

Apparently according old coworkers recently quit order pursue dream one ~5% people actually paid, kinda sad really much taken advantage of. It’s taking away freedom 🤣🤣🤣. Stupid ppl pandemic absolute worst. right protect passengers asymptotic carriers protect people assholes sick decide fly anyway. 

It's case trying find one thing going save everybody, little things help done correctly add lot less infections. Death dignity. Like old village leader going “walk” longer suffer family take care him. Arizonan, confirm yes, tests easily accessible, yes, results slow. Stick fork state, we're done :-/ Awesome.

Unfortunately, unless Vermont blocks travel Florida, Texas, Arizona, others via land, sea, air, states fester plague export around country. don’t think so. US aimed giant firehoses money banks keep afloat things ok. much trickier beast can’t beat money - need plan discipline, two things leadership US incapable right now. Pretty much treated pandemic since day one. Unlike Florida Texas California's positive test percentage steady good sign Well 1M survived. That’s great news people getting  think Brazil still let in. could good news, true. would mean vast majority go without symptoms without damage internal organs?

On flip side, know hospitals saw increase hospitalizations, people affected others?  would simple prove providing respective percentages positive tests. eagerly providing data, one conclude match talking points. I'll believe verified data.  Reuters article manages avoid naming authors title paper. Impressive! It’s since December. Mark words. Funny happens testing rolling out, death rate continues plummet Europe population : 741 million

US population: 328 million Elevated coronavirus transmissions related hospitalizations worsening parts California, failure wear masks public increased gatherings partly blame, health officials said.

Riverside San Bernardino counties recently appeared reappeared state’s list counties needing targeted monitoring state officials. counties, increases gatherings factor elevated disease transmission, outbreaks state prisons, nursing homes patients transferred Imperial County, home particularly bad outbreak.

Gatherings also factor increasing hospitalizations Santa Barbara, San Joaquin Stanislaus counties. Officials also blamed “decreased attention personal protection measures face coverings social distancing” Stanislaus County, whose largest city Modesto.

To sure, California health officials say long-term hospitalization rates remain stable, percent testing positive. uptick hospitalizations related coronavirus last week; June 14 June 20, number people hospital confirmed suspected cases COVID-19 rose 4,323 4,679, 8% increase.

The concern comes healthcare experts sounded alarm growing disease transmission rates across nation. Community transmission highly contagious virus continues problem states Arizona, Florida Texas, also California, according Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head U.S. Food Drug Administration, speaking CBS’ “Face Nation.”

In fact, pandemic may slow summer experts hoped might. Instead distinct waves — first wave spring, followed quieter summer second wave fall — nation, still stuck first wave, may continue see pandemic persist without summer respite.

“This like forest fire. ... Wherever wood burn, fire going burn. right now, lot susceptible people,” Michael Osterholm, director University Minnesota’s Center Infectious Disease Research Policy, warned Sunday NBC’s “Meet Press.” “I don’t see slowing summer fall. ... think we’re going see one very, difficult forest fire cases.”

Some parts California, including Bay Area Los Angeles County, seen spikes hospitalizations even though overall cases going up.

Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County’s public health director, said Friday average daily deaths continued decline. early May, L.A. County experienced average 45 deaths per day; early June, average 20 30 deaths reported daily.

Hospitalizations L.A. County steadily decreasing recently plateaued, Ferrer said.

It’s possible reason might hospital patients tested coronavirus, even they’re facility completely different reason. “So we’ll need watch information carefully weeks ahead,” Ferrer said.

In Riverside, County, potential transmissions occurring public protests large numbers people close together wearing face coverings.

Patients northern Baja California seeking care also factor increasing hospitalizations county, state officials said. number people hospital confirmed suspected coronavirus infections reported Saturday 366, 36% increase three weeks earlier, May 30, 269 people hospital.

San Bernardino County also seeing increasing hospitalizations, state officials cited concerns increasing disease transmission workplaces, state hospitals, county jails academy facilities. number people San Bernardino County confirmed suspected coronavirus infections Sunday 330, 47% increase three weeks earlier, May 30, 225 people hospitals.

Riverside San Bernardino counties among rescinded mandatory mask orders. Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed statewide order requiring masks worn public. Newsom’s order, two dozen California counties mandates requiring residents wear face coverings, largest Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, Contra Costa, San Francisco San Mateo.

Out California’s 58 counties, Riverside County observed highest percent increase hospitalizations last three days Sunday, tallying 20.9% jump. counties state tracking include Stanislaus (19.7%), Kings (17.9%), San Joaquin (16.2%), San Bernardino (13.9%) Fresno (12.4%).

Some public health officials expressed concern economy opens up, people assuming get back routines, social gatherings.

“We found businesses begin open up, people, sense things OK now, began gatherings home birthday parties,” Sacramento County health officer Dr. Olivia Kasirye told Sacramento Bee earlier month.

“That exposure. multi-generational. people higher risk,” added. “You people together extended period time” observing six-feet social distancing, often wearing face coverings.

San Diego County also recorded several new outbreaks last week — tied gatherings.

Of eight outbreaks reported last seven days, biggest four five cases, Dr. Wilma Wooten, county’s public health officer, said last week. said deaths associated outbreaks.

Two confirmed Wednesday announced Thursday campground “social club,” according county officials.

San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher said social club open.

Officials said asking residents voluntarily comply public health orders. officials find egregious violations businesses, could shut cited law enforcement agencies.

The county refused release names facilities associated outbreaks. said outbreaks businesses involved employees, identifying places would create risk businesses reporting cooperating contact-tracing efforts.

Fletcher acknowledged gatherings people’s homes involve people different households would present challenge law enforcement agencies. gatherings illegal county’s public health order.

Wooten said private gatherings homes, people less inclined wear masks, would likely banned public health order herd immunity could achieved, unlikely happen year.

Paul Sisson Morgan Cook San Diego Union-Tribune contributed report.  Deaths much behind really fucking surprised? maybe asymptomatics..... Couldn’t agree more. it’s like.. quit, somehow forfeits ability get unemployment TECHNICALLY “refusing offer work”.. risk life people households lives going place 5 days week even 25% see coming contact 10,000 people day ensure money health benefits?? Nobody make decision. even grocery store employee. times government take CARE all... it’s shame. Crazy time, gotta make decision next Monday :/ virus wants spread, killing hosts help cause, virus get weaker, either later. believe pushed companies cities like OC. California big economy rely lot food/restaurants/face face jobs lot. lot people basically put rock hard place, either go work risk covid stay home get paid. 

Both options horrible lot options, getting support government money wise. bound happen. poor black.

Didn't already know this? Yet GI issues tend resolve.

There lots redundant blood flow GI tract. Ischemic damage sometimes seen imaging time surgeons open someone fix issues, damage usually resolved. Gives bit credence “it’s clotting disorder true lung disorder” theory.

Whatever is, I’ve treated patients know don’t want it. Wear masks. Speaking Sahara dust cloud

But Texas Commission Environmental Quality forecasts “the intensity duration dust expected enough raise daily (particulate matter atmosphere) beyond 'Good' range throughout impacted regions.”

Although people may sensitive dust others, Kimmel says may silver lining timing cloud’s arrival: **“The good news we’re wearing masks.”**

Lies. like comment. eh lockdown long time CA, seems rising (less south fair). NY aided fact quarter population immune. r/yourjokebutworse technology, say, developed members church.

Let guess, prayed newly installed filter? Yes increase testing, also, know differences mortality rate mostly age distribution. virus getting weaker - scientists still saying functional difference existing strains - virus infect matters lot. Covid infected 80 year olds, fatality would 10%, infected 40 year olds, fatality would 0.1% under. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio get less deaths cases. idiots would travel right now. gotta nice holidays Switzerland right? agree quarantining tiring, states cases rising ones took virus seriously early either implement measures lifted early. Many states high per capita measure largely rural states may assumed “cityfolk” problem. Would kinda make sense, scared getting it.. big deal mind.. idk think PSAs traditional media &amp; social media go long way. 30-second spot every commercial break showing exactly &amp; use mask correctly covering NOSE &amp; MOUTH probably would've worked wonders. News covering every broadcast good, too. many people complain I'm saying 'but can't breathe' say need wear mask nose mouth prevent possible spread &amp; catching virus. really can't breathe mask nose &amp; mouth, perhaps someone else shopping them. Looking excess deaths general, can't soundly attribute covid, paint quite blatant picture. 200k earlier September sure, we're already there.

The info CDC website, last saw instance, **15,000** deaths Alzheimers would expect last 5 years. Similar, worse story, deaths attributed pneumonia would expect previous years. ""Natural causes"" also spiked.

Again, obviously cannot integrity attribute covid directly, order magnitude higher would expect given averages since 2015, something fucking up. Except infected spread uninfected.

It’s like saying campfires drought thing matters forest fires.

But campfires cause forest fires, gods waiting room Florida full dry CoVID19 kindling. Newsom gave lockdown right Memorial Day like many states. 3 day period went saying “lockdown would begin easing months weeks” “announcing plans begin lockdown easing week”. speed actually enacting easing next day. acceleration timeline zero new data support total idiotic move part. major hypothesis. pattern witnessed london northern italy.

When 25% population exposed (probably connected part population too), becomes much harder virus keep spreading. need government make rules teeth. businesses risk $1000+ fine every time provide service unmasked customer instead telling take hike, sure everyone inside place business masked. Weirdly, parents (mid-late 60s) got bad fever one night.

It's strange disease. Take precautions take vitamin D! I'm taking chances myself. Wow. live wait anything? unacceptable job then? adopt family? Boris Johnson changed mind real quick infected. claim, hypothesis fits situation. 

I see 20 trumpsters butthurt though. actually research yet. would really help. Also continued follow up's months would help track it. Gov Newsom incredible began, feel he’s swayed financial loss outweighed loss life. 

Remember going phase going based stats? 

Who knew opening business enforcement masks would lead this. eh strong argument reason things slowed much significant chunk population immune. pattern happened London, Italy. much due increased testing? ever clear stories like this. double testing, double number cases, no? cases would flat circumstance imagine place going look like get typical monsoons. Everyone’s mask going soaked seek shelter inside place eat, shop. take masks shit going spread like wildfire.  we'll deal symptoms forever. 2100 10,000 us left trying figure grow potatoes salt water. Results probably next weeks spike Wow, knew must’ve term describes perfectly. Thank this! find ways address Smart move answers. imagine type reckless selfish person takes wear one all..ever scary thing that's tons tons ppl. I'm Hawaii, cases spiked three main clusters discovered (households 10+ people + nursing home outbreak) one really stupid pastor held service house member present virus. Number cases back 4 reported today June 21st. talking about, America best. right ignore anything want want to, even means killing others ending planet /s

For real tho, second someone else people, lose god damn minds. “Only violate others rights” graph. didn’t think would happen. I'm talking locking lol. I'm talking lifting lockdown. process easing lockdown started May 10 Johnson detailed several stages steps UK's coronavirus plan – detailed a 60 page plan. May 13 people allowed take “unlimited” amounts exercise; play sports outdoors meet one person different household, long outside. Claims without evidence dismissed without evidence. issue radiological resolution necessarily proven cases correlate full functional recovery liars Jesus. That’s anything new either. Low sensitivity tests missing people low antibody titres one reason medical experts caution people take test results guarantee. trying measure overall prevalence population correct it, doesn’t help individual person. OC, mainly coming LA people stopping BC go hikes using loophole allowing travel Canada get Alaska. 7 Americans fined $1200 far. 

As Canadian, thanks that.../s Woosh Well, would interesting compare survey kids think. Shrodinger's cat dead alive? We'll never know. Seeing FL week behind reporting likely already beyond 5k cases day. We'll see that... tore cover book matches... Zero accountability, like GOP likes it. I’m supposed run marathon Boise, Idaho September. always looking state numbers! Best luck there. tougher action like pardoning violating hair stylists? New Jersey here, close NYC. seems area significantly died down, rest country *just now* facing demon.  Leave Americans politicize standard safety precautions. so? Antibodies measurement immunity past infection even works type longer numbers like 80085! homes apart helps imo population density big factor. It’s cocky part correct. live SE GA. It’s like place never shut down. SW GA still rural, already hit peak smaller towns there(see Albany Ga). time coming I’m counting ability evade based two factors:

1. Low population density
2. conduct shopping local military base, use masks mandatory.

Nothings 100 percent risk low compared average, complacent citizen town. really think economy magically recovers open millions people become infected once? Even majority “mild” cases?

Consumer confidence plummet. one go regardless things open. Businesses still close record high infection numbers. That's great. guess relations come stronger fall apart. Glad one that's gonna become stronger. That's true all. perfectly happen government tell pregnant women bodies people love. I'm sure lots want government arrest guy walking street assless leather chaps. 

They government telling people do. this. weaker strain (the viral dna going altered mode exposure), speculation would result less severe disease. actually is. FAA created reason, interests public safety. Maybe FL get sickness way summer.  New York comment. Seattle hit first. Seattle success. New York not. coming seem describing dissociation, common coping mechanism traumatic experiences. exactly - kills long time long latency period, necessarily selected against. God it’s sad. It’s fucking embarrassing right now. Supposed “leaders” clearly crumpling face first real crisis ever faced office. give us. Lies. Receipt. what? Power. Money. Elections. I’m tired it. next person gets face politics wish hadn’t. Yup president thinks hurts reelection chances everybody's reminded pandemic time, would rather people see masks time (also, want testing, optics cases). 

His followers whatever says. Don’t want compel people go pregnancy even though don’t want to? Servers bring food without masks literally falling onto food breath talk little worrisome. Even outside.  Who’s going fight fires free now? nursing homes, that's certain Georgia counties ridiculous death rates Transmission date day 1, Average test confirmation day 10, average death time 24 days.

SO two week lag new cases new deaths Finally way natural selection reclaim rightful place human existence.   true, never understand it. people ever took look know virus thought ""well I' sat house 3 months, get go out, ""reward, dammit"" want, want, want, me, me, me."" (Selfish Californians paraphrased, probably) Duh-doy. Video here:  might go back work Sounds like it. Crossing fingers stays single digits longer.

Good luck. Every time get hopes one things always ""it reduced infection 5%"" insignificant number. hope different. doubt believe Holy water. Robert Redford, appointed head CDC 2018, wrote AIDS Gods judgment, primary cause AIDS epidemic single parent families? 

That Robert Redford? want make sure several months

I see all.

Maybe *many* years later, never catch virus again, possibly bad first time. However, virus probably become endemic, like happened past flu pandemics.

It's really hard body lose degrees protection naïve first time. better example hand right now, vaccination provides high level immunity three five years decreasing immunity thereafter. person vaccinated later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies smallpox cases Europe 1950s 1960s demonstrated fatality rate among persons vaccinated less 10 years exposure 1.3 percent; 7 percent among vaccinated 11 20 years prior, 11 percent among vaccinated 20 years prior infection. contrast, 52 percent unvaccinated persons going delete original comment really want argue people want choose panic. also stated matter fact, basically certainly case going studies released far (look Rhesus macaque immunization COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2), better prudent thread getting lot upvotes. wedding wasn’t eating, people walking around hotel without masks. tables obviously can’t eat guests away table think wear them. Ideally would wear drinks hit table, since next take order. Grew WV. remember family stop going Myrtle Beach kept running dad's patients. primary care doc.

The last straw fat guy lifting shirt beach: ""Hey doc, think rash?""

Tell ur wife wear mask 14 days. kids too. Stay away her. Nursing homes also rehab facilities... plenty short term care patients; people post op knee replacements/shoulder surgery, stroke, generalized weakness hospitalizations.. 

Hospitals don’t discharge directly home aren’t safe. need 90 minutes day therapy, discharged rehab home. article mentions even raising wages much $16/hr, positions filling. Lol. don’t consume boomer news. 

And article literally says nothing opening early lockdowns. excerpts UN report. UN IMF hate brown children research faulty? analyze comprehend anything checking make sure site posts usually puts articles agree with. Also Abbott: Open schools. Get kids back person. wear masks want school makes them, won’t make kids wear them.

What fucking tool. one too... called great outdoors, mask covered faces, six feet apart. Trump makes Boris look like fucking genius. [This must air system covered Jesus' last week sending riddles cities, obfuscating language whatnot mask usage. 

Then someone ""figured out"" shit-eating grin news ""simple"". reporters even grilled saying ""Why pandemic, make direct clear order?""

And top off, instead charging person, they're charging businesses adhere rules. 

So, business put charge, told open, there's enforcement rules randomly decided adhering it. 

Considering TEA confirmed schools opening August fall semester, we're going see good news while. safe wouldn’t need waiver. Actually Telling people it’s safe like could void waiver. It’s stupid thing do. hmm. good question actually. Summer months souther states like winter months northern states. Everyone stays inside climate controlled environments. Ummm... holy shit. live NJ. discounts annual passes? Uhhh... that's accurate. least from. 

Where I'm people supported reopening rural, regardless employment status.

""I'm working want vacation, go restaurants, can't tell do.""

""I can't open business going government.""

""I can't go work anymore government let me.""

""I work want haircut.""

The urban / liberal folks saying keep shut use government funds bail people business.  Weird way talked sinch navy mess around tested negative twice became reinfected. ppl saying immunity load crap..there already ample proof search become reinfected meh reopening guess. KILLS 1% ppl might die promise 5th time gotten even bit less intense time enough damage cause long term problems. True. aren’t even sure people recover build lifelong immunity CFR change IFR.

Especially measure IFR age, either remain constant decline advances treatment protocols. Wow. It’s rare see someone without mask streets Seoul. still people obviously hate wearing masks cover mouths. make neutral eye-contact them, sheepishly adjust masks cover noses. can’t imagine living mask-less community. I’d scared shitless. said, patrons take masks inside cafes restaurants. can’t help get worried sick every drink meal tho... bizarre Fox *still* believe pandemic kills. Remember that's average, full even number. accident victim go hospital away, heart attack wait longer ambulance, etc etc would inelligible unemployment refusing work

I think major part push re-open. look talking points, protesting complete failure social safety nets aid. think organic push, think peons bottom believe entirely motivation So, point testing? Even 30-40% false negative/positive error rate true, point random testing? HIV test, valid date time taken. Twenty minutes later, could infected contact infected person, may may showing symptoms. So, again, value testing thousands people? like thumbnail article, soldier staring confusion really. zero line. time day matters goes matters. CA well testing compared states. little brother dumb motherfucker too, best friend went vacation UT, despite family trying talk it. still lives home two immunocompromised parents. brings COVID might set fire. wife weaknesses exposed started individual therapies cope better work things. going come stronger ever been. trying work home two toddlers help grandparents yet.

Awesome analogy! entire northeast corridor seems well VA... that's like front door they'll sneezing fit removing mask putting coat rack making way kitchen grab food (NYC).

I feel you... Virginia PA (doing extremely well) MUST hold front line! Enact mandated 14 day quarantines Carolinas, Florida, Georgia... none seem well. I'd HATE go NJ way mid March like two weeks ago. shit heels wearing masks fucking disgrace learning fast Thanks! estimates true # daily cases early March late Feb? (Obviously official numbers horrific underestimates bc tests) would nice contextualize numbers, though could also look hospitilizations. Oof. broken clock right twice day 1000% this. direction central message, going much harder implement one. anyone try probably late. go again, millennials getting blamed everything. much time hands socialize 2 jobs.

Fuck. beat coronavirus. weird pneumonia epidemic. one saying go back work go store. stated (and absurd people--even you--still fathom this): whatever need do, safely. means, need go bar drink 10 friends. means need go office ""you feel productive there."" means wear mask, practice social distancing, avoid large events stay healthy.

Edit; Check data available ""Excess deaths"" Trying think, perks exist quarantines?

I guess get construction projects done quickly. Killer Cuomo. I'm server restaurant wear masks time 2nd wave come! 440 counted current case numbers distributed many days no, really represent spike since numbers still falling overall state. Also consider 1.6% state's population confirmed positive COVID-19 is. probable 2.5% infected throughout state, number likely even lower overall prevalence. pretty weird response. continent from? Cause obviously seem know lot Nordic Countries! bit easier island. generally time EU stand US. ages, US forcing every single EU citizen give tons personal information, including social media accounts, want enter US. EU, however, welcomes US citizens open arms. bullshit.

The Trump government fucked corona virus response. Every precaution EU needs take, protect citizens US government's failure, Trump. offense completely insane frame people losing life's work, either form business forced close athletes longer able train, slight inconvenience. little late lmao.

Holy fuck already????? That’s part problem, can’t provide actual evidence - states like Florida &amp; Arizona ramping contact tracing according officials, aren’t need be. Also didn’t say “widespread”.  month ago called, wants tired old argument back. 

This silly point. There's way Nordic catch Sweden terms death toll disability burden now. [Bjorn Olsen wrote good takedown absurd notion Especially we've *already* discovered treatments reduce chances dying quite substantially. Sweden failed peole massively frontloding deaths allowing infection spread within Swedish society continue terrible ramifications health economy. tremendous job killing elderly nursing homes seen guidelines recommending that. Sure guidelines say raise mask talking waiter. fucking want wing sauce burger juice mask lol aunt. symptoms, tested positive son husband didn’t live small house practice social distancing all. thought supposed wear mine like mustache... Unless evidence China India's actual numbers accusations counts completely useless.

Health officials around world agree everyone (including US) counting amount 0 evidence either China India systemically counting relative US.

Even China counting factor 10 would still far fewer infections US.

I never said US terrible US' response COVID-19 absolutely terrible.  China shills going come say China always completely transparent virus?  90% flu deaths children unvaccinated. know exact percentage adults know shot helps. may keep catching flu might keep dying. Get flu shots please!! Many States India currently this. Especially lockdown ended people started travelling back home states. They're stamped indelible ink hands need take pass travel inter state. team checks middle 14 day quarentine end. show symptoms they're tested immediately. 

That said- monitoring become excessively difficult them. They're supposed install app tracks movement 14 days. People leave phone home go business. [another Houston LBJ Hospital's ICU bed capacity 108 percent full. Meanwhile, Ben Taub Hospital says ICU bed capacity 76 percent full, Houston Methodist Hospital says they're 84 percent full. absolutely should. look curve, nearly identical Europe’s meaning handled virus well control...meanwhile, Arizona, Texas, Florida others process virus going **hyperbolic**. 

If it’s possible quarantine staters (not sure works federal law), then, new yorker, I’d livid Cuomo didn’t enact said policy. low levels disease, spread extermely stochastic, even die people it.

Exponential growth really takes hold scale, take significant time build pandemic levels. silently growing southern states months now, example.... forget anxiety fatigue caused imbalances brain body chemistry, right? True, source behind imbalances psychological, there's also reason can't physiological. 

Yes, virus around short while, thing effects body unique COVID-19. disease causes lung damage, example, plenty medical studies indicating long takes average Joe recover such-and-such. there's nothing home case comes that? need go hospital happened? think relatively minor differences restrictions explain entirety difference New Jersey's extreme drop infections versus California's plateau, evident either side opened outside dining curbside retail? Pretty much everywhere virus hit also excess deaths aren’t part official count COVID deaths. it’s small number exactly causing remains mystery, it’s crazy think least people died COVID weren’t tested it. Good question. experience people generally good possible, places (trains, major train stations, inner-city markets, etc) it’s physically impossible many people. 

I don’t know it’s common US, basically every open business establishment large bottle hand sanitizer entrance customers. everyone uses it, it’s definitely thing. False. politically inspired racist ""Ghaina hidin' Covid"" theory. reality exact opposite true.

Estimated toll US 2x reported figures, based surplus deaths, pneumonia deaths.

Meanwhile China effective means used identify infected population eliminate chains infection. simply lot people infected Covid China circulating population. Since there's almost risk people meet Covid, free move country business - long comply infection control practices like masks contact tracking. get anywhere anyway community put that.

Some means used achieve outcome undemocratic inaccessible free society. used ones accessible free society. China 125,000 dead (US reported), 300,000 dead (US actual) 470,000 dead (US reported scaled China Population). China really 4,634 1.4 billion citizens dead. they're happy that. feel many. agree.

The purpose argument make crisis US look inevitable, absolve leadership inevitable calamity. problem world US unique unprepared, slow respond, effectively prevent infection monitoring, tracking disease prevention - though Sweden, UK Brazil close. people uniquely unwilling cooperate, peer pressure others so. resulted curve deaths likewise unique: tail drags on. staggering death toll - greatest world. leadership responsible ongoing level death destruction would literally go total war external country for. underlying issue lack opportunity along insufficient social safety net due current perverted economic system. Unfortunately, falls disproportionately black population mostly due racism. However, also affects poor whites, Hispanics, etc. definitely lofty goal, curing racism solve core issues. Unfortunately seems time time need actually see bad people bad things people actually reminded vote them. plants live longer, power music Alabama says “hold sister I’m going in!” fuck would anyone want visit pandemic hot spot anyway? pay visit NY right now. anyone ideas way wearing mask ears covered? work grocery store want able listen podcasts, would frowned upon management. There’s lot unpack “mortality rate inflated” conspiracy “case count increasing testing” conspiracy “this virus wasn’t worth hysteria” conspiracy company gets 80% it’s revenue 20% it’s customers.

Choir practice would like word article makes point argue NHS currently properly contact trace. 

If can’t get fully operational contact tracing yet, avoid reopening. Even better headline would 4 50 states participate 27 people upvoted him. end, second wave would definitely smaller, professionals right. possible self-administer hospital-grade ventilator home might need it?

No. People actually concerned well others don’t mind actually adhering guidelines. know downvote away guys want reason selfish. No, they're opening countries outbreak control. would want slightly nuance clarifying political spectrum there's right wing, far right. like there's left wing, far left.

""Far-right gasbags elected around world past years, 2020 deals WORST possible thing deal given egos ignorance?"" already thing? Jesus guys fucked up. talking countries versus US did. comparing plans effects among individual US states. title appears misleading subs slogan  take gang four testifying today.: self serving, self preserving bureaucrats first, doctors scientists second. carefully crafted language avoid ire Trump. However since Trump unquestioning attention 30%+, every time says something millions react. rest us long ago figured going on.

so Fauci, redline et al., quit mass. Demonstrably. Hold press conference tell everyone one loud listen Trump, chloroquine testing, get killed.

won't happen,,,,their careers matter much them. Fauci fired saying That's false equivalency.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* data says daily death rate plumetting, many weeks already. Case count increased started testing more. also think adjust virus mortality numbers number people already dying pre-existing conditions, caught virus died instead. increased deaths, even completely stopping virus save them. virus death numbers poached routine mortalities, like drunks, drug addicts, tobacco users, morbid obesity, etc. Many sober responsible people catch symptoms all, people risk need protect themselves, otherwise virus never worth hysteria getting. Yes think mean almost human societies, top 1% tends naturally accumulate wealth/resources. took top 1%’s assets re-distributed everyone, would naturally flow top 1% again. Yeah doctor probably even say that. Patients sit look doctor face hear want hear. doctor *probably* explaining mask protect *him* protect *others* decided ""well directly benefit personally must useless"" children's hospital numbers included rest states' availability numbers? Cause want approach anything near capacity cause requires much resource re-allocation. Lmao gonna lower mask, take bite, put back. real. hard.

Where live quarantine province visitors MONTHS.

When people come in, questioned border. give explanation are.coming in, plan isolate 14 days, contact information (cell phone). answers good enough, turned back. allowed stay, told enforcement officer randomly check them, time day next two weeks, residence indicated happens, arrest warrant issued.

You therefore ACTUALLY check fraction random people get high rate compliance. similar tax collection works, speeding, anything else. threat ramifications drives behavior, checking every single person. realized giving free money illegals wasn’t going last forever Feds aren’t going bailout bankrupt Cali failed policies. U safe 3 months strains covid. It’s like flu, mutates catch again. chances already mutated, identified. Goodallow, saying public, non-profit health care going cost ***ME*** lot money. 

I, every Ivy league expert seen heard clamoring cost public, not-for-profit health care system going cost ***the entire planet's economy***. Full stop. Period. End discussion. crisis going away. going get ***worse***. ***Much worse***. going become constant, yearly event. 

We lucky get long without pandemic outbreaks US, time ***gone***. adapt new age super bugs hit populations year year year, mutating adapting evolving while.

The private, for-profit health care system running 110% capacity virus hit. virus hit running 500% capacity ***it nearly broke planet***. dismiss anyone everyone take situation utmost seriousness. Every American citizen needs free, government backed healthcare, needs good healthcare, needs well funded US army is. 

Or going suffer catastrophic damage simply cannot recover from. Remember: state banned cities within mandating wearing face masks. Mask mandates unenforceable Texas, last checked. 

This governor ""trusts individual Texans make best decisions health safety"" rather informed medical professionals specialize public health. 24 hours news cycle shit scourge echo chamber entertainment. would recommend reading articles analyzing accord. Ad hominem attacks aren’t ever productive. Agreed. saying to? Honestly biological terror attack, America would fucked beyond recognition. huge wake call. mean fuck, one aircraft carriers completely shut down. realize value aircraft carrier brings US global stabilization? 

Immediately people overreacted hoarded/bought everything shelves. week things went back normal. like everything else country, give 15 minutes move next big thing. add this, hasn’t increasing need blood plasma donations coupled many people fearful going health care settings ruined economy hospitals get overwhelmed. treatments still require hospital care. Without space hospitals, people die could saved, even since said progressed treatment options. ¡Que la Covid se quede para siempre en Francia! I've seen studies R0 (not Rt) 1.5 8, suprising . main advantage virus presymptomatic / asymptomatic, long incubation time, almost one west immunity (even believe study protection coronavirus).

Btw article clickbait, anyone february put doubling time 4 days ""almost"" natural rate. study put 3 days.

 isnt days? Damn ones ordered days ago already sold out. 3M 6000 series want check eBay amazon vendors. Mine aren’t supposed arrive til end week can’t say anything yet they’re ones friends use work bodyshop wear everyday, recommend them.


3M - Half Facepiece 6000 Series, Reusable - Size: Large guy looks like stock remember also order filters! They’re like $20/pair buy one pair. guy amazon sells 10 pack (20 filters) $160

I figure pair lasts weeks 10 pairs get rest year. Plus still KN95s N95s backups.  live Texas. blaming us going spreading it. we've heard since April everyone staying inside killing economy need get back there. lt governor says verbatim ""there important things living"" regards economy, told die economy. scolded going out. us stayed inside many go out. subs got brigades anti protestors blaming rising numbers BLM, rise already momentum even Floyd died. Abbott even lawsuits filed Dallas trying get people wear masks, blocked Dallas taking action salon owner (look up, want write paragraphs ridiculous became) state officials supported even directly contributed gofundme legal costs.

Now told fault wearing masks going that's we've told months. blatant corruption. 43rd testing 5th cases country. Abbott said got word hospital CEOs overwhelmed Houston hospitals capacity, one CEO even said going keep coronavirus. We're getting lied criteria constitutes serious changes every week. Texas bad spot. basically abandoned shamed it. THEM. I'm finding Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor, Governor California. I- Funny, perception characteristic mental illness. won’t know you’re sick hoax infected many people around you. peddling weird race relations link coded language? testing people ""likely symptoms"" FL versus broader ranger CA? case numbers would look worse FL relative CA think anything clear assuming discrepancy true.

I see compare states inconsistent testing methodologies unless correcting testing variances statistically. think headlines May bleach you. Today: 363 new deaths/ 31,496 new cases
Yesterday: 267 new deaths/26,079 new cases

Maybe new deaths catch up, im trying see good news wherever find it. looking numbers would appear may getting cases better able handle sick.
Time tell gets hand, maybe we'll die, seems kill/cure ratio moving favor. Whered u see that? see read article posted using dictionary definitions instead admitting actually difference asymptomatic presymptomatic scientifically speaking.

Edited add text directly link posted earlier:

Asymptomatic spread is transmission virus people symptoms never get symptoms infection. infected carriers could still get others sick.

Pre-symptomatic spread is transmission virus people look feel sick, eventually get symptoms later. They, too, infect others without knowing it. Hospitals opening back don’t diagnose everyone covid get grant money. Also current trajectory US

What scary NY NJ surrounds responsible early growth, declined lot. rest country making numbers looks far, far worse. Arlington find somewhat amusing Dallas mandating masks Betsy Price FTW like fuk it, open'r up...completely ignorant ""Go... back? HELL y'all talkin bout?"" -- Texas still believe way Swine Flu played 2009 really set us disaster, people saw dire predictions that, none materialized assumed COVID would way. really think Swine Flu didn’t happen people would taken lot seriously. Yeah, Hearthstone beat long jump made claim Mayor New York stopping contract tracing BLM protests US. way topping that. get. man, nerve-wracking frustrating edge week finding negative. Well, no. recoveries good news. US handling Covid 19 many places not. true. California locked example, movie theaters still closed however. handled well, locked early, learned people locked long economically viable, reopened, they're still getting massive spikes. Locking work long term, that's facts, fear mongering go route “CHY NA” hearing rumors protest governor's office organized Antipa--- wary.  San Diego? seem think trade-off shutting things (for flattening curve) good trade-off economic hit.

Nope, congrats concocting argument canned replies to! [Florida excess mortality particularly high rate compared states. experience recent? possible kinds difficulties recent phenomenon, cases exposure go area.

While article focuses one particular drive-thru testing site one neglected neighborhood, another [recent testing generally inaccessible across Phoenix.

And here's [a Twitter someone basically went Phoenix looking test (he willing, seems go anywhere within 30 mile radius) took days find place would test him.

Are Mayo Clinic tests available general public? Lookin' you, Joe Rogan know why, filling cough admitted? measurement deaths unfortunately. feel likely increase starting week would give accurate picture. Problem California can’t deficit spend, running unemployment money feds said, “running money? Better open businesses back up. stimulus.” Beautiful. Northeast recovering! beautiful. love this. I'd hate live place like Arizona. Best job could find! can’t lose election you’re alive 😐😑😐 tl;dr guess states stole N.H. state motto ""Live Free Die"" romantically thought would ""live free"". forgot second part died./s

I'm angry. know people living one states. scared go stupid jerks without masks lack social distancing.  going bring 2nd wave end lockdown last longer us. come surprise. opening up, certainly increase. concern hospitalization rate sky rockets ALOT people die. Hopefully New Yorks. Let rephrase message wanted convey: there's ~~no chance~~ *really* small chance partial loss protection regards COVID-19 enough deemed ""catastrophe."" infection ~~just won't~~ almost certainly bad even manage catch again.

Edit: yes, follow health guidelines listen consensus medical experts. Maybe old guys WH die replaced younger leaders actually improve god foesaken country. Wrong what? course cases going rise. median age case dropped dramatically. 

I'll admit I'm wrong deaths surge like doomers said were. great aunt, who’s 90-something lives Florida. got e-coli going eat restaurant son’s birthday month ago, better, went Alabama past weekend. She’s got heart condition too. mom going calling tomorrow try talk sense her. guys good! congrats playing MMQB. wearing leather shoes. Usa #1 baby. Yeah. ""Plandemic.""

I first heard woman neighborhood NextDoor. neighbors crazy. woman paranoid lunatic, shut up. ever noticed businesses closed that's lockdown is. ""essential"" worker always saw people walking dogs, yoga, running, walking, conversing neighbors drove around. seem think trade-off shutting things (for flattening curve) good trade-off economic hit.

That's kind really weak argument make know bad things could've gotten mitigate.

Of course, look portions world hit earlier US was....and mistake deadly.

In short? seems like:

- trying cake (complaining safety measures taken, helped keep safe) 

- eat (complaining economic consequences that, get sick...because community made choice prioritize health financial economy). Antibody tests would shown show deaths entire country low compared cases. Probably better treatments+more testing start burned elderly people preconditions deaths align quite reaches healthier people fight easier.   India fucked lol  won’t anything.. says it’s safe send kids school. see turns out. real world call reality.. Lockdown though. least states handling well. Florida Texas ended seeing sharp spike. no, “fear mongering” it’s backed evidence. facts. can't blame China helping US fight virus... ""Some may die, sacrifice I'm willing make"".

*cheers!* lieutenant governor said old people wanted die though. first person tested positive uss Roosevelt March 22nd. sailors tested positive second time may 15th. MAX time less two months. virus around, capacity, since late last fall. immunity lasted less two months, would TON reinfections. Logic suggests reactivations. Stay cautious; avoid paranoia. Yeah, like article here.  Nothing worry about. Could link P100 mask recommend? He's literal psychotic he? ((woosh)) want give everyone thought Florida fine big fat ""I fucking told so"" 

Floridian here, truth great everyone expecting us fail certain people hateboner Florida. What's happening anyone might expect open bunch indoor spaces know damn well that. 

We everything right, outside mask mandates. people afraid success, guess. close eyes nothing front happening. See man covering face yelling ""peekaboo!"" keeps disappearing Two weeks ago, college work Florida said ""Now state Reopening, college. sensitive people's needs understand need work force back campus.""

Having immuno compromised wife, WFH 3 months, balked asked director staff coming back students still aren't. said understood concern ""thankfully job student-facing risk. probably get another week two WFH hands tied return campus.""

Checked email today mysteriously college anybody come back earliest date they're saying staff mid-July... Ahhh, realsies time. Got it. Beautiful, course doomers find way make bad. Mugabe

Y K E  Two weeks deaths still declining. course opening + protests going lead cases. median age positive case declined dramatically. CA actually great mini model america. large cities rest rural. I’d imagine early urban lockdowns indeed helped seeing spike rural areas top plateaued/ downward trending urban areas. ¡Pregañte!  casino eat cheap food drinks.

I joked friends thank gamblers subsidizing meals. Actually, notice deaths keep dropping? know treat patients. thing completely new. do. know many patients need vent. throwing everyone vent low oxygen levels ppl syncing them. also putting patients nursing homes anymore what, 40 50% deaths? ruined economy knowing treat one's fault.

Edit: due overflow field hospitals used? Even NYC. plenty staffing well flew states took retirement. never question large number going ""get this"" 122k dead many got sick due negligence narcissism. clear media needs reformed remain dangerous propaganda wealthy interests. Mocking someone genuine curiosity cause match views? I'm thinking troll, guy. think I'll exit. fun stuck two trolls opposite sides other. one example. Florida positives increasing dramatically testing totals last month. mass graves bodies thrown trucks NYC, people didnt care ""real America."" Well except maybe convenient required stay home (if resident-that means leaving house work, etc) hotel quarantined place (no movement 14 days) state designated otherwise get arrested go jail caught violation order. saw hospitals reporting car accident fatalities, gunshot fatalities even drownings covid deaths inject covid post mortem count get federal funding fight covid. needs throttle down. 
It’s obvious last 5 months people dying. 
Sociopath. He’s going prison loses. That’s is. Seroprevalence implemented lockdown cases continue rise, didn’t get massively infected. definite pattern areas got hit super hard way better areas didn’t. doubt it’s due policies lock downs since many regions totally different lockdowns adherence them, yet curve.

Go worldometers, sort deaths per million, look every single country 500+ deaths per million insanely rapid drop curve almost daily deaths now. states too. There’s way every one places magically implemented hard lockdown whole population adhered it. 300k Chinese students study US universities across country. Probably other. *""Data Florida Department Health released Monday shows 50,000 people can’t pinpoint contracted coronavirus spread them.* ""

Ya, lot pregnant women can't tell certain father is. question. work warehouse 5 people. I'm one wearing mask. protecting protecting ? fucking assholes refuse wear mask sound crazy  posting weekly month... it’s data! took shut seriously. us didn’t leave house outside grocery store visits three months. California: Draconian lockdown, 4659 cases per million, 141 deaths per million.

Florida: Typical lockdown, 4666 cases per million, 148 deaths per million. feel dumb believed time. used trusting federal government stuff like brain never caught fact federal govt statements lies. Even doctors lie. saying individuals choosing wear masks follow safety precautions themselves?.. actually system one blame?... 

I bet want system pay college tuition unemployment die too. Forever victim lol Considering diet the, apparent, direct link vitamin D? Yeah, he's fucked sideways... Ohio? Dewine one first take action develop testing tracing capacity open safely California - safe, long rate hospitalizations stable. Yeah, kind I'm saying. Sorry think needed /s there... growth confirmed cases though. Back April somewhere around 10-15x difference actual confirmed cases placs (based antibody results). Right could easily like 5x difference (or knows). 


The scary part that, continues, we'll reach several times numbers next weeks. family still thinks fine vacation Arizona Nevada week. could talk sense them. I’ll dig deep sympathy get sick. admit fucking nonsense someone forward WHO? considering quickly ran away said ""I feeling sick weekend""...that funniest thing seen good while! think every news site world needs invest thesaurus night extra shitty, MiL, I’ve always loved, legit came racist tonight, it’s 100% Facebook. Using words like “thugs”, hoping “rioters get coronavirus”, etc. 

heartbroken. talking QR passport China. Contact tracing S. Korea rely tracking app installed smartphones. wouldn’t worried Trump decided go swimming thunderstorm. wonder why. LOL wutt. admit deaths 100K less recorded? know smoking maybe enough tonight. WHADDUP NOW, SWEDES? WOOOO

-Shaguar  Dallas Friday evening. Last study read suggested needed 90% compliance masking really bring Rt - would nice \*mandated\* instead asking nicely. considering are, compliance better now. Haha! Yeah, like taking guns, worse man... They're taking freedumbs now. Ridiculous.

I blame educational system. defunded exchange tanks tear gas keep us line. Quite dystopian.

Where from, friend? sounds nice, I'd take sidewalk full face shields maskless hordes day! fine long touch inner part mask allow anything could virus also touch it. That’s works. You’d hit 50+ percent seroprevalence notice decrease infections. decreases we’d see right behaviours citizens. Arizona shining example clearly. people would leave hospital medical advice anyways. We've lot those. Everytime read comments like Facebook wherever feel sense dread holy fuck country never going get mess. Positive test percentage remains low. stupid probably would negative effect approvals say masks ok wear indifferent instead acting like masks stupid made look weak.

 fact, might've even seen bump approvals independents acted like cared Covid opposed getting re-elected stock market actively dump anyone tries anything tackle disease. cough start conversation. need mask germ bros! lol [Show know work, still say ’recovered,’ don’t tell means may need lung transplant,” Antoinette wrote Twitter post. “Or may come back discharge massive heart attack stroke, COVID makes blood thick hell. may oxygen rest observations (of hospitalized patients):**  Everybody swollen skin blisters tight looks like it’s burst, head heel. skin dry peeling flaky slather Vaseline every shift almost necessary — over.

Countries like China, Korea, India, they've existed thousands years US past due taking example. Cardiac deaths surprising considering people afraid go hospital. Also can't cause death listed multiple things? see increase pneumonia deaths COVID? see repeated sub lot anyone actually know coding deaths done? *Goes crowded spaces, 0 respect social distancing wearing mask. Gets diagnosed COVID-19*

I don’t understand happened CDC US administration colossally fucking isnt mutually exclusive. Stop small minded shit lol Homes Texas like million sq ft! won’t people stay home!? husband live 300 sq ft studio northeast managed increase cases going grocery store walking around neighborhood mask keeping distant others. Yeash. date, 1·2 million people worldwide recovered COVID-19, remains concern organs, including lungs, might long-term impairment following infection (figure). protect themselves, yes, evidence bad use since SARS (1). protect others/limit spread infected folks, evidence good many years. 

I'm sad see people saying, ""Masks work"" mean is, ""Masks fully protect ***me***, I'll wear one, care happens anyone else."" think matter facts &amp; perspective. Yes, great many people recovered. Looking perspectives though, means low number compared cases we've &amp; increasing. celebrate recoveries, worry give false sense security states spiking cases, in, ""See, people recover! need follow guidelines more!"" 

There's also good news that's misleading, like article one stylist salon tested positive, customers, all, tested negative. read article, know small percent customers agreed tested, idea overblown headline is. Again, people use justify going back acting virus. 

I really would like see good news, I'm AZ &amp; spiking like crazy &amp; go masks/social distancing. People think almost/is now. pay attention local news. want to. want see good news &amp; bad. really happy states reopened successfully, I'm there. wrong say no, btw. We've said weddings close first cousins letting grandparents over. may like it, one day months we'll able give unsolicited unwanted WELCOME them. Lol yeah used want public healthcare too... learned lesson quick Honestly seems like tide turning. virus Trump's first real test leadership he's failed beyond anyone's wildest expectations. Insert obligatory “wait two weeks” comment mean protests began two weeks ago... That's one hell Ctrl+Z. least less damage. cares something else?

If argument includes, respect, “right” unequivocally decide whether wear mask social distance - none rest argument matters.

It becomes null void point. can’t take rest argument seriously you’re capable level ignorance. 

You’re one brought protests anyway (hence goalpost moving).

My initial comment based Trump rally Tulsa last weekend.

After last comment I’m sure know goalpost moving even means. 2 states entire lot led Democratic Governors they're still better every state list. give dose reality know will. need cleanse country GOP corruption mismanagement every level. figure that? coronavirus subreddit ya goofball😝😝  I'm sorry loss. probably never facts, unfortunately, I'm glad people looking. soured wanting government involved administering healthcare. We're obviously capable electing competent leadership healthcare simply important bungled partisan incompetents. remember 4chan toxic place internet, crown taken Facebook exactly, get paternalistic try filter information bound go bad. keep saying this. would taken responsible leadership deliver effective public health risk communication. proper PSA campaign federal support could helped avoid need shut downs altogether. wasted opportunity - Trump could sealed re-election he’d handled right instead fixating $$$. Don’t jinx Northwest Arkansas seeing ton cases too, especially Benton County (Fayetteville). Whataboutism. like people say ""all lives matter"" BLM protest. Daniel Andrews said** 11 new cases investigation **there would ""*****significant community transmission*****"" among new cases**.

Yeah, must tough first. scenarios doctor nurse could’ve prepared for. bet many experienced health care workers struggled help free space hospitals.

VICE NY Times fantastic docs watch YouTube remember featured hospitals transferring patients upstate free space. Many patients deathly ill transported special medical busses, I’m sure freeing space much difficult even realize. guess that’s field hospitals important. Sup, bro, welcome list! Hot Pockets, literally good thing going. became first Europe end epidemic.

And managed despite sharing sizeable border northern Italy, tell something. US could learn lot them. don’t know true take grain salt. apparently “Covid parties” younger people hanging verified carriers hopes get with. guess it’s herd immunity thought process might end America settles since isn’t enough people care atm. alarmist diminishing anything since there’s conflicting studies, workforce made mandatory testing tons people showing positive don’t symptoms. Don’t know means shall see. Like one group 13/18 test positive 2 developed symptoms loss taste. 11 quarantining. tested pods. Hmm wonder global pandemic going right anything hope so, really really do. idiots screaming ""freedom"", needs realization ""freedom"" requirement ""responsibility"" ""care others"".

The base, utter, overwhelming selfishness country just...flabbergasts me...I get it. happened ""caring fellow man"" (updated human)? happened front lines care others? lost much society drive ""almighty"" dollar, fucking thing even worth much used be... Many are, lot harm lying masks Let's hope development trash trend;

Our government told us mask=bad first 5-6 weeks pandemic, reccomend weak enforce mandate. affect people still wont wear mask initial bias projected government masks dont work. legit community protective equipment, would halt virus, apparently saving face important saving lives.

The whole ""Canadians polite"" thing obviously bs since Canadians dont wear masks. Either misinformed willfully ignorant I'm sorry saying 25% new York infected?

Where getting information? several data points percentage infected, may two antibody studies max. know one grocery stores. I'm sorry think extrapolating lot graphs may seen getting confused.

They also implemented lockdown can't say 25% partial herd whatever. true. kind dumb question re-using masks can't find clear answer. Lets say need wear mask enter work building. go in, pass people, wash hands, go office occupant, take mask. safe reuse later day essentially contaminated public already? Yep, 100% genuine Reddit comment. ever say concern. Please stop putting words mouth. Please stop seeing want see well. also said low. also clearly stated lockdown stay safe, minimizing clearly would say that. y'all wear mask stay home probably fine. good night believe arguing whatever think saying head. needs masks science? Praying virus away worked, God’s plan virus spread. Wearing masks interferes God’s plan kill bunch innocent people. Please adopt me- medical bills high. Thanks! Same. hate it. It’s fundamentally everything taught growing up. blows mind. what? political point? Nobody politicizes taught growing up: “cover mouth sneeze.” different 😩  wish Colorado would something similar. Even symbolic. probably gonna see rise cases soon like rest country. Fun fact: urgent care facilities don’t take Medicaid Medicare. none insurance Federal Market Place. Things already dire many areas. yet somehow someway foreign assistance voter suppression disinformation campaigns, POTUS get re-elected. going do? going purge non-whites put concentration camps? Unless change administration level, hope. vote care. same, okay ""cover mouth sneeze"", need mask? Luckily they're 2 hours away dont see thru this. see posts/pics snapchat fb makes shake head.

Is sub USA news? Nearly every new post US. mean, without Trump dying office complicating everything. Well goes back generations funding police military it’s thing society needs. Thanks corona got see kid crawl, sit start standing. happy got experience that, think also took toll marriage. hard living close other.  far know, found 1 person several positive December person never contact wuhan. recent trip Algeria. like 3 full months ago even got bad can't believe people thought, still think aerosols magically stop traveling reach 6 feet mark.

As imaginary barrier halting traveling further. get it, scary especially parents older. sounds like parents smart things right I'm sure mom safe possible OK.

ETA son disabled I'm worried catching virus. I'm letting get first haircut next week since started. Given information feel like masks work acceptable risk take safety precautions place . extra even stylist (who also friend) cut hair outside. Probably overly cautious hey willing. Thanks, good points. feel like Australia took longer crack international travel (especially Europe) also feels bit like extreme luck play too. I’m 50 parents 78 81–I’m definitely gen X, I’d always thought folks boomers anyone know Turkmenistan doing? Like, vaguely remember March president forbid mentioning virus country. None usual suspects sites stats. anyone know anything? Look, I'm need seriously reevaluate attitude towards Churchill. Indian friends, example, never love him, famines all. come conversation guns blazing people likely really know *other* things got fighting Nazis.

Just dropping info without judgement would much effective. probably less stressful interaction well.

I always knew he'd issues recently see awful was. Even century old standards. iPhone feature settings send unknown callers voicemail. see alot people talking ways keep getting infected here, allow bring attention. ""Acquired"" fine racism well object white people regime. world America Asia. Plus: dictionary, book ethics, book statistics, phone book people actually know infectious diseases write articles agree there.

Cultures less emphasis social interactions (Asian, Scandinavian, etc) tend much better others.

Then there’s also places like Brazil India social distancing essentially impossible many due living conditions Hey hope family stay safe too! Kids mostly real well far, 26 pediatric deaths US 14 years old far Covid. comparison 500 pediatric deaths influenza past season. think kids gonna OK. make 26 less heartbreaking still end feeling like do, main worry always kids want deal it. go days Denmark without seeing one. shopping centres, public transportation. That's horrible news :(  Why? fuck still argued PROVEN?? fucking obvious 6+ months ago!! reason certain subject population fucking selfish stupid think helps applies them. always knew morons never thought bad. Holy fuck, man. can't believe it...

Sorry get out. Rant over... guess New Zealand found vaccine hid rest world then?

Or perhaps thinking flawed. hopeless! still get control, take collective willpower strong leadership. Sadly, anything proactive America completely disappeared. sad. friends, I'm one still self quarantining. Everyone else gone back living normal life...and live one states experiencing spike right now. People make excuses carry on. 

People still dying suffering majority people stopped giving shit it. one them! give up! many good people nothing.  County Judges: Everyone must wear masks

Abbott: Here’s executive order preventing counties imposing fines anyone wearing mask

Abbott: businesses open now

Lt Governor Patrick: better things living

Abbott: Hmmm...there seems rise people dying COVID-19 Gigiggitty  really news though? Even though everything I’ve said way indicates do? It’s truly sad someone blind allowed work healthcare. really hope you’re janitor something, otherwise ones advocating endangering others would superiors letting anywhere near sick/dying. whole presidency ctrl+z progress. Lol Trump suspended them, including L1 H1B end year, he's reelected I'm surprised extended. None cases linked protest movement 🤦‍♂️ Yup part realist looking headline thinking oh good oh bad. actually read article interpret news yourself. Like said, many headlines misleading don’t dig actually presented. Stay safe Arizona, sorry hear many heads sand. I’m California, people pretty good masks, cases continually ramping up, positive ramping slowly, unlike Arizona many southern states ramping fast Total shitshow country

The government borrowed 3 billion USD different international banks already steal part it. Everything corrupt fuck.

- oxygen hospitals
- Several doctors nurses received payment 3 months
- PPE healthcare workers
- slowing testing testing kits might run weeks.
- Ambulance workers PPE
- Economic relief reach correct population.
- relief/help people evicted
- People defaulting loans mortgages relief
- Health minister vice-ministers removed 3 months shit.
- Outside main city famine fucking lot families government provided help.
- Donations (food PPE) made private companies stolen mayors governors
- Tons small business going bankrupt
- President making stupid jokes TV everything going hell.

We completely fucked!  Especially Trump. reelected he'll defund like want. happen right masks make virus disappear it'll beautiful, like miracle. too. suspect many variables determine spread within givin population. Another quote love:

""The old world dying away, new world struggles come forth. time monsters""

Antonio Gramsci get point you’re trying make, we’re side, think might come wrong way  Ok, thank you. I'll try calm down.   That's called Flip-Flopping. certain government officials laser focused shutting travel place could possibly come from, China...and kicking back Big Mac, job done.

Regardless, NY post loses credibility it’s targeting left-wing groups politicians it’s agenda driven journalism support right wing ideology. simply requested article less biased source skeptical claim. think countries Europe (UK especially) 2nd wave when? September/October? mandatory mask AUS either. Feel several beneficial factors play got though (and main source outbreak breach containment protocol). lost interest, apparently Google beat it.

That shit cray. breathing? list /s

Seriously, type person needs guide small wonder choke small toy parts kid. Masks mandatory times, people wear shunned. Bottom line. get angry times leave home see people without like ""regular time"".  White people 

Americans.  

Tons people Europe, like Czechs early adopters masks everyone. Unfortunately live area lot ignorant white people harass wearing mask. city impeach Newsom protests every day since masks got rerequired. Lol don’t? I’ve said made say that? Pretty aggressive talk. I’m “essential” worker, I’ve worn mask mandated employer required stores around go without things like movie theaters, malls things nature like everyone else. go ahead assume I’ve done something “wrong” say don’t deserve healthcare become sick don’t think line liberal bullshit thoughts 24/7. You’re sick person don’t deserve care people need. Seek help yourself. Pretty sure unconstitutional unless it’s asking mandating. can’t discriminate based state live in.   Think week bad, wait til next week. Even implemented tightly enforced restrictions tomorrow would still take least 2 weeks effects would felt. meantime cases would continue climb. 

They wont implement restrictions things spiral control. would late. It’s false equivalency. Countries required masks early probably also many guidelines place time help prevent spread. stricter country’s response general, slower spread. Masks one facet response. Lügenpresse, Hitler would say.

Stay safe friend. exactly comment political?
And exactly decide subject political? sign surge NYC far, protests massive. I’m honestly really surprised  take 10 amoxicillins? Sure cheaper Mexico, ain’t short drive border gas goin’ back up. Researchers scientists still need time research. helps donating, sharing articles research, encouraging philanthropists support cause though. part 14th Amendment, part International Bill Human Rights. Every day corona replica previous  is. weird ""I can't breathe"" also applies Covid-19. nothing. Exactly like thought. typical. Show sources say vaccine 2021. That’s six months. Tick tock!

Front line employees rarely wear now. customers don’t either. depend business even point? Seems like AZ 10% test positivity Going work sit office thing more. America, tons elders saying virus problem. average tested age dropped person 60s around 37— age almost zero risk. That’s positives deaths won’t follow. hey, go ahead shit good news; try make terrible. It’s do. Trust hear that. feel bad healthcare workers, high risk needlessly endangered purposefully stupid behavior. [Two hair stylists coronavirus wore masks. 140 clients. tested, none got wear fucking mask Spot on. Exactly happened. I’m nyc peak knew. density could hear sirens non stop. spread town even severe don’t think people would really notice it. luck, maybe pandemic knock tiny bit sense back previously batshit insane housing market here. I'm sure commercial rents going drop tech companies realize necessarily need overpriced office space. I'm Healthcare worker, I've watching people care us families whole year putting us danger haircuts bar stools still adequate PPE.

If end patient ill take care job, want to. 

You. Don't. Deserve it. Denmark people comparing conspiracy theories. Since must terrible inefficient, possible protect infection eyes, sorts things.

From early January, kept telling people purpose masks protect others, protect others you. blows mind, people still even want eat out. barely even take standing 12 feet away someone moment. Last thing want someone breathing food making me...

I eaten 4 months, honestly probably ever plan eating again.

Also, wallet thanking me. deaths, post-covid stuff IMO. stuff force work months. Many people can't physical labor anymore even getting virus 3 months ago. That’s get rioting like dumbasses mean douchey comment  guess stupid people killing stupid people quite qualify? Maybe still need take moment really consider someone else might problem it.

My kid’s NICU stay billed insurance well $100k. (I know, paying pocket - pocket would HUGE) NICU week RSV - easier case. That’s bankruptcy many Americans without insurance. (I paid $750 since lucky fantastic insurance)

100% Trump received plasma serum somebody antibodies. okay care more.
I'm actually President special protecting treatment. (I mean army personal bodyguards even best times. protect President.) particular one, protected, stops protecting others... problem. know measures implemented hospital spike 2 weeks late? thank you. went BLM march Sac two weekend ago, EVERYBODY wearing mask, that's hyperbole. 16 days far still symptoms, I'm major risk category (diabetic, reasons behind march made worth risk me). People really desperate blame anybody themselves, indeed family gatherings everybody stupidly thinks since know ""they'll fine"" “a network people” recommending people take hydroxychloroquine? excellent tests

Not one broad spectrum countries - European , Asian , north American reported quality issues Chinese test kits ppe. assume tests excellent

I spent 1 minute find two news articles. find many China releasing truth obviously much better America

I comparing America.
Also correct fewer than. 300 cases ""reported"" nationally. 
How would argue 3000 instead 300. lack scrutiny opaque ability censor undesirable information. Haha meant real wager, maybe like embarrassing post reddit  believe could true game changer. pill fight virus early stages.

A little shorter steps

 

Concrete questions

 

At point aussies version, similar, little shorter. Dude enrollment across board already double digits. lucrative students China absent entirely. guess try business usual approach things blow semester cancelled. Australia (~100 recorded deaths) potential negative excess deaths flu season good predicted, social distancing hygiene reducing transmission. However causes self harm may increase. mods care gets hurt burying heads sand Literally, graph says 90%. Seriously. zero people hospitalized COVID-19 Vermont.

ZERO Thanks, Antaiseito. April 6 Monday hit 30k+. back testing less now. Checking evil east coast Massachusetts lowest transmission rates country bunch people masks. data set clear indication manipulation lacks credibility usefulness. You’re trying compare apples marked poker cards. It’s rather unscientific use corrupted data. think New York Tough attitude kinda brought people together. still wear masks public social distancing place. amount loopholes jump reopen things strict (I write plan reopen lab demonstrate everyone kept safe, disinfecting surfaces, amount people room). even take everyone’s temperature arrive. That’s perfect description Drank kool aid? Brainwashed thinking what? It’s interesting Virginia opening back cases haven’t really spiked. Indoor dining 50% capacity, even gym open! Wondering governor mandating masks public indoor spaces.

It doesn't. Iowa mask mandate. cases pretty flat. Deaths hospitalizations near time lows. Hardly anyone wears masks.

Also mighty hard eat freaking mask on. sure think masks work shit people eating seeing increase numbers. Please show reputable 90% graph. least Cambridge, still see people wearing masks distancing. Missourian here. may know we're seeing spike rural cases. live small town population 1,600. multiple campgrounds area, popular one outside town. Every weekend literally hundreds people coming larger metro areas go camping floating. They're shopping grocery store, they're getting gas gas station... they're wearing masks. We've least two cases person spending weekend one campgrounds testing positive Covid later next week. warn us contact tracing. scary. Scary shit, control. shudder think happen Bull Float comes town. Unfortunately, US tests aren’t perfect. believe lot false negatives 70% accuracy. 

My friends Covid bad. Eight weeks illness three negative tests. antibody test - positive. think didnt mean US. others said thing mandatory mask rules came out, used reason manpower consulted county supervisors. Great response!! Also, dexamethasone thought reduce deaths third that's going help well. Thanks, I'm thinking worth it, even like 'veal'. Hopefully fix issues Victoria create bubble. suspect it’s still lurking around NSW well wait see. almost got plane Nz started little faith Australian Government it’s worked okay. Good news subgroups prespecified Ok. prob. 

actually needs happen turn everything outdoor fleamarket setting..... Illinois' JB Pritzker good response, although good states mentioned. since takes 2+ weeks get sick Counties closing. They're going defy governor. guy work waiting week half results. 

Some friends mine went got tested results less 24 hours. 

All place. someone PM text find way around paywall? Weird flex, okay ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ feel like headline day last week so.... legend Parents complaining quarantine told cases spiking states opening back said “that’s cause they’re testing now, haven’t testing they’ve low test kits”. supposed reply that? Don’t forget, people wearing masks political stance/statement. late. Same!

We'll probably next month. Maybe August squeak by. Americans think unlimited rights zero duties. OMG, can't make up. classic. posted r/nottheonion seriously? going new thing Trump holding indoor rallies worst hit areas? 

The impact going go far beyond gathered arena itself. people see big crowds every days, people going convinced let guard precautions too. he's lieutent said everyone prepared die economy Low population density, rich, white state. Nobody afraid premature death rich new england yankees, they're taking seriously Imagine wanting protect genocidal racist leaders bad.

Here's alternative.

Fucking goddam history stop promoting bad people. 1.00001 also exponential growth.  Lol get people muttering breath wear one.

Again, clue help, use? 

Just case. Haha yeah Washington State. Sorry confusion Regardless political opinions, there’s really valid justification permitting one other. know that, I'm offering suggestion might - majority people currently testing positive younger better able fight virus. quite like March enough tests go around ones tested *really* sick died soon afterwards mostly elderly.

Edit: said, States definitely fudging numbers. example, pneumonia deaths seen insane uptick. Florida Texas, past five year average little 900. year they've seen 4,000. Georgia, past five year average around 500. far year 1300. compare figures award silver medal mental gymnastics. quite gold medal performance, still laudable. Absolute nonsense. half brain think 100 thousand people streets close proximity chanting screaming others face didn’t increase spread. symptoms pulmonary embolism? Ban think US needs experience Darwinism.  love almost universal response is. part common psyche. feels like New Yorkers dropping guard starting believe virus going away numbers &amp; state reopening. still worry it’s gonna spike again, possibly even worse April. like America. guess depends insurance get it. could easily 3,000 hospital without lousy insurance. Clinic much cheaper hospital pretty much time. better gun? unreasonable people -not- gun? 

In addition, think necessary right healthcare education put people debt. 

There different systems place countries. think consider done remain. 

Thoughts?   I'm busy make better alternative one visit. fucking something. You’re one power. god’s sakes. sent meme... type 3 numbers google type new cases... look everything comes up. Kinda fuckin weird... yup. think lot less government policies time amount people culture thinking ""it over"" CA STARTED reopen. least that's happened lot circles. 50% spread done asymptomatic people. nothing protect passengers them. Explains pattern currently seeing places got crushed round 1 still seeing cases, even accounting policy compliance differences Shutdowns - thank goodness. statistic somewhat absolute. even enough testing kits nationwide get accurate infection rate. Barr idiot mind.

You know know mind. Funny said leader country got beat fuck America Impossible. US best, I’ve seen them! wouldn’t believe tests. best tests! Looking sources say long term issues common expected. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* gone. Laying low smart play. Stay away people refuse wear mask. Go hang friends. Go outside thankfully! vote uniformed way viewing this.

First, know true fatality rating among non-pneumonia related deaths primarily impacts younger generations.

We also know many people suffer long term complications raging kidney failure strokes lung failure.

Lastly, important people selfish assholes. good people healthy. important healthy people avoid infections us high risk innocent, good people interact selfish assholes. No, government terrible job. Trump administration terrible job. still terrible job. 

There’s reason seeing spike cases now. It’s three weeks straight people protesting streets. protesters older 65 we’d really fucked right now. good news mostly young people. mostly mild cases. Youre already trouble friend. dont see extent now. Lockdowns coming. People change behavior. end American century nigh. White House trash made appointment drive-through test San Francisco entire process took less 10 minutes. Two cars ahead line. got results less 24 hours. May efficient government interaction I've ever had, hell wrong Phoenix can’t understand mentality can’t wear mask 20 minutes people wear em 8 hours straight. damn ignorant. Ugh Totally agree you. people wind dialysis covid wrecked kidneys. Others heart damage. Shutdown beaches Amity island, said. one thinking it. Wait isn’t possible could previously done good job, subsequently relaxed done poor job? They’re opposite end spectrum? Go look per capita cases death rates.

I’m praising efforts, making observation. actually, Florida’s deaths per capita like 30th, FYI. Hopefully doesn’t change Florida hate bit unwarranted point, think criticisms becoming fair.

Also, Florida state lots lots people travel to. So, part isn’t reflection Florida’s efforts alone. Unfortunately lot travel state. 6 people know (young adults) came NY peak outbreaks. It’s incredibly common thing don’t think fault Florida that. Don’t believe states blocked interstate travel. Florida hate weird Reddit.

EDIT: Florida around 30th ranking per capita deaths per capita cases. Given number people travel epicenters, that’s solid effort. Things appear changing-that, course, isn’t good. need mask head sand though. would paid higher. would pay higher Americans competing third world immigrants. actually believe immigrants disappeared overnight, strawberries get picked? orange baboon's stance getting it, dying it. data proving people dying higher rate  Yea think people missing already staff basically free test. office temp checks everyone every day although don’t think keeps safe, free takes 10 seconds per person I’m it. 

But office also gave us extra sick time case get sick exposed letting 50% staff (those jobs possible work home) work home.  Dumb people violent. surprised? Yeahhhhhh, I'm answering questions. thought contact tracing ""you've possibly exposed {location} {time}, there?"" yes then, ""Where last X days?"" ""Quarantine home 14 days report symptoms health dept.""

Why contact tracer need ""assess symptoms, better characterize [my] underlying risk infection, assess home social factors could impact compliance self-quarantine""?

If get called, match time frame exposure, problem quarantining home. I'm turning health information social media handles. fully realize assholes broken quarantines necessitated level oversight ffs that's LOT information, otherwise protected various laws, turning rando answered cattle call contact tracing jobs. Oh yes. did. missin, boss? Oh shit, really? two week hotel quarantine?

Because thought WA one new case traveler back country quarantine.

Edit: realised, Western Australia. 

I've long since woke up. He’s probably secretly vaccine doesn’t give shit. make sense brothers sisters humanity getting murdered protests bringing justice finally. proud city coming together, even though cases rise. terrible sacrifice people choose make, line drawn somewhere corrupt country. Lol single source says majority people experiencing this?  know someone returned New Zealand quarantine 14 days could go wherever. zero current cases pay low wages endless supply illegal immigrants willing work peanuts. mostly transmission indoor family events SCP-45 Thanks. I'll let sister know. best friend got COVID said worst (physically) ever felt life. Considered going hospital ultimately recovered 5-6 days hell. 28. minimum, need government pay people quarantine earning jobs, *regardless* whether test positive, simultaneously banning employers firing people self-quarantine due potential exposure. 

Anything less creates incentive workers can't afford take two weeks unpaid avoid getting tested and/or lie results. No, chance long term issues microscopically low. Name one “good” leader hasn’t done something bad. idea talking about, can't make care people. 

Yet wont stop using police force Compassion fellow human beings. ones can't fight virus they'll die. Compassion hospital workers working like crazy keep people alive putting risk. care haircuts. wear mask leave house. difficult stop selfish 20 minutes day.

Awww, compassion people livelihoods destroyed. children trapped abusive parent months? people put medical procedures.

Selective compassion empathy badge petty tyrants wear proudly. Finland goverment great work stop virus. Pretty much immediatly shit hit fan, army deployed borders uusimaa province going highly surveillance. Also people general understood situation bad. could worse. allready started prepare worst thank god wasnt necessary. Hope everyones allright safe. Take care :) negate possibility parts immune system could offer protection. 

We hope. 3-4 months protection would catastrophe. Or, we'll dead read it. live still isn’t access tests. knows? I’ve thought thing! Some, like 1% sickend? untied states sure true. Evidence covid population skewing vastly younger lately. Deaths could stay  poor suffering policy implemented party Fox News sucks dick of. Right America nonetheless!

And children cages border, guess 'network people' care suffering huh?

Fox cares suffering benefits bottom line.

GREED. subreddit support group long term sufferers. r/covid19positive  point make sense public transparent. point create legal loophole depends debatable definition goal decreasing numbers make look bad. Huh, that's weird. /s, 

I'm sad discussed I'm glad is. Especially think piece cloth mouth sign weakness. 

Imo, afraid putting mask face, seems pretty weak me... precautions keep germs spreading. dick, right. one people throw hissy fit can't go local Wallyworld w/e places enforce masks. beds. enough trained nursing staff (who come COVID-19 themselves) handle overflow. necessary drugs, equipment PPEs. Areas around sending patients hospitals they're capacity. like small towns throw hands let people die. ship nearest big city.

According today's numbers TMC, ICU capacity 1,462, 1,213 beds full. surge capacity, adding beds good staff care patients. Overworked staff make mistakes.

And let's overlook people might need ICU bed reason COVID-19. happens them? 

Real leadership would front plan share constituents. Instead get platitudes deception. really care party someone claims represent. want know there's bigger plan ""deny"" ""shame blame."" Weird everyone fixating masks study goes that: obesity, prevalence smoking, colder temperatures, masks, international travel bans. Spreads via AC restaurants office buildings... CA, FL, TX, LA, AZ... blaring AC right - coupled everyone wearing masks, following social distancing, etc. = new cases. Studies months this. Seems levels government missed one. Ugh. fewer coronavirus deaths FAR may true cotton mask - depends construction. surgical mask protects others you. studies compared real world efficacy N95 surgical masks influenza outbreaks found detectable difference.

I need copy paste it. surgical mask 100% effective? Nope, neither N95 anything pro'ly BSL-4 suit. However, surgical mask worn properly filter large percentage coronavirus sized particles. Look ASTM specs masks see.

Wear mask, try touch outside rub eyes scratch nose. complex things. 

Here steps:

1. Ensure good fit nose mouth that's comfortable.
2. Live life. Seriously wtf kind racist stereotype that. Asians also respect authority blindly, practice martial arts talk family honor? Jesus. You’d see weren’t l1btard sh33p Yeah people make masks seem way fucking complicated makes people comply. Make sure they're nose mouth. Wear every time public indoor spaces spaces can't socially distance others. need wash hands every time touch them. need go crazy washing time wearing new ones every time go out. better 100% people 75% right 60% people 100% right. everyone followed simple way it, would crush thing. really. Japan pretty uncoordinated awkward response significantly smaller amount deaths compared U.S (adjusted population size course). fact, many countries undergoing strict quarantines, things large still open Japan people went daily lives undeterred. explanation comparatively small amount deaths near universal use masks Japan. Unless assume Japanese people suffer less underlying conditions might otherwise make succumb virus, use masks seems like defining factor here. idiot. Everyone fucked start. EVERYONE. NZ country shut virus spread.

Now failure leadership top finger pointing who's job led states fucking disaster. matter states deaths governer inept. matters people learning mistakes. 

On top cracks US society lack social safety net showing massive disparity wealth. ruling political class bought paid corporations ultra wealthy individuals akin American royalty since wealth inherited. like bad orange man big white house. asked local city reddit mask elderly MIL fly Singapore. person thread claimed doctor tore pieces. Said effective public taking one away doctor. 

The redditors generous way.  Kohfeldt thou? Anyways, hope manages stay first division Werder... Teamgeist! 100%, correct. intend that, part makes difficult kids desperate get back “way life.” parent, make difficult choice best interests hope one day see them. long keep spirits figure different ways engage peers distance, make work. homeschooled past, (with one young child) least know against! act faith humanity, oblige you. 

Covid spreads extremely efficiently. infected begin exhibit symptoms 14 days. Imagine many places one goes two weeks. 

Now, know it’s respiratory disease breathing, speaking, coughing sneezing ways virus goes body atmosphere respiratory droplets. Wearing barrier source respiratory droplets (your mouth nose) keeps air. Less virus air means less people exposed. 

That’s mask effective. Coupled social distancing, measures shown significantly reduce rates transmission. like article says. read article? Seriously. CDC supposed people trust expect expert advice . Really disappointing . Everyone common sense knows trust inflated Cheeto says . Also, I’m little confused careful touch it.

You're right - less ""don't touch mask mask might contaminated"" ""don't touch mask involves touching face, hands might contaminated."" Preferably double flipping bird. black, okay (?) true. see new SAG rules actors? 3 covid tests per week separate holding talent away crew. There's way producers going pay BG, especially non-union BG, comply actors, others get infected, applies non-union well.

You're right: Background acting going effectively dead long time. months, clusters often centered nursing homes, prisons food processing plants. Americans venturing public more, new types outbreaks emerging. I’m fan extra hassle hand washing masks. I’d rather make life little easier throw em washing machine clothes.
 
I don’t stick dryer, let air dry. That’s effort feel like going through. countries defined every disease Corona, Thailand way 'round. Unless N95 mask better

Korea here. N95 makes readily available every pharmacy entire country *and* post offices rural areas.

No surprise really we're among countries done best control outbreak. must new science developing diseases learn fly Lol way much effort   Put mask March 15th, made illegal so. Got laughs couldn’t cared less. $150 fine don’t wear one. Man, heard great advice regarding essentially boiled “don’t worry everything much, John Wick 15 inch horse cock spouting jizz everywhere.” extent, mostly stop spit reaching first place. difference naked dude pissing leg wearing pants, dude wearing pants pissing himself. government office 3 months behind noticed something else Sweden. wear mask people keep distance lot better. go don´t use mask lot people walk close like pandemic over. wear mask almost everyone avoid me. mask might help. distance creates helps. fAkE NeWs. BaD iSnT RePuTaBlE sOuRcE. I've since January still caught (WA state). Probably daughter, got school district cares money safety. Anyway, wore still wear respirator masks crap except stop exhalation droplets. nothing inhalation. Anyway again, people probably infected even know it. Indeed... looking good. feel? think nervous word comes mind.
With population 1.3 billion, numbers come India truly shocking.
Seems transmission community based (though officially not)... already used lock card.
Additionally blighted like many countries populist government deeply immersed denial propaganda. California 5,502. first 6 counties SoCal accounted 4,244 cases. Bay Area 537. 

San Juaquin Imperial county yet reported seen 100+ cases day. forget people critical thinking skills downvoting people saying masks actually effective We're Jim Jones moment nation. Imagine that. Fauci March 8th 60 Minutes: reason walking around mask.  
 
Adams fucked up, Fauci WHO. public health community failed many levels pandemic. friend Trust me, people 3rd world countries want come still. social distancing? December first time life got flu cold gave bad pink eye. Always wondered covid. ass fucked whole week. sub isn’t you. New people come time usually showing r/all. Vietnam somehow 349 cases 250000 tests. That’s incredible. odd. honestly insulting someone works NYC city hospital commenting first-hand experience. can't speak either get trouble get silenced even anonymous places like Reddit. kind protest nowadays , regardless genuine motive, contagion gathering. 100 years ago History books talk Philedelphia Decided hold Memorial Day celebration spite Pandemic cities decided dangerous. history look back Trump crazy Campaign Tour?

# Philadelphia parade

**But every city vigilant. There's mask sight photo 1918 Memorial Day parade Philadelphia. death toll ended much higher cities stricter lockdowns.**

**The 1918 flu** [**killed **Americans. ""That's equivalent 225 450 million people today,"" said John Barry, scholar Tulane University author of** [**""The Great Influenza.""**](http://www.johnmbarry.com/)  **""The numbers staggering.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

**SOURCE:** Trust know. understand people coming out. dont begrudge single person reason. ones anger end ones refusing simple things would allow everyone emerge nightmare (wear mask, wash hands, back f up). Olympic committee already publicly promised refunds lot article scaremongering. helps imagine world though everyone green paint fingers

It might (I think get trying say), found comparison extremely unhelpful. experience far paint would travel virus, green paint visible means can't imagine scenario would spread effectively virus.

I agree saying think different example would helpful. fyi, even common cotton masks reduce risk infection ever slightly catching aerosols potentially carry virus. statistically significant? Probably 100% selfish reason wear masks well obvious selfless ones. masks though countries required masks early also implementing strict lockdown measures social distancing?

The main thing prevent social distancing, masks. Masks going provide real benefit cost certain level infection within community. However many countries underestimated level infection. true. virus actual literal death 150% people come even superficial contact it. 2 advance team people announced testing positive. rally Tulsa. Supposedly wearing masks... like doctors science community whole. Required masks *Acquired masks?
I can’t bothered reading article title already seems off. rear view mirror perfect spot hang driving around wearing gloves important thing know never trust government ever again. Right, don’t reuse masks. Cloth masks machine washable they’re made well enough. woke marine transportation petroleum, guys returning symptom free 3 days test. federal guidance man/woman uses department healths guidance “fit duty” slips. Bonkers background / extras part industry everything associated toast there’s vaccine, probably never return anywhere near pre-Covid levels. I’m sure “crowd” scene real people playing crowd ever again. Extras already treated half-humans, producers hate pay 12.50 per meal extra or, like, provide even basic wardrobe — certainly aren’t going spring testing. going hit working class / least-paid people Hollywood hardest. Everyone fine anyway - singing songs shit mansions - going continue make money. Everybody went non-essentially guilty No, definitely issues back early Feb. around April

Thai authority extra pissed European tourists, Italian politicians cussing constituents wearing (amongst reasons), parts Spain ignoring it, list goes on. There's also Russia, otherwise calling western countries instead white people would better term, even then, countries fully board wearing masks. you’re emitting droplets out

So, talking? running, biking, anything might cause pant air? Posted pic plane mask Feb 20th god mercilessly mocked Instagram. First mistake IG nerve backtrack say county judges force business require mask backtrack meant along, divine words correctly.  Dude fucking pandemic. Either clear communicating local officials GTFO. Apparently concept much Americans grasp. Writing Asia- looks many us like guys headed way full steam. Worth noting 140 exposed 46 agreed get tested. 

So, still good news, still wear fucking mask. 

But wish people would get tested could see masks prevented catching it, them, whatever. Protesters wearing masks we’re seeing limited spread events. 

The problem people still think shit hoax. people parroting ""they're completely effective, worth wearing"" bullshit. promoting mask usage result people socialize 3x more

Well good thing anti-mask Americans socializing large gatherings flouting isolation guidelines. fine. checking words in. think method sheep bahhs coughs would effective. find post here. call BS. Trump Pompeo say lot things like without proof. study germany modeled effect voluntary social distancing, showed could enough curb spread without intervention. want reduce spread parameters social distancing masks two them. Dampening around mouth helps smoke, think droplets actually harmful: water help carry droplet contents outside inside. gotta witty reply ready. Something think rest day. Definitely escalate things. Let’s forget trump administration. seizing PPE racket Trump Jr. 

Just saying... Even take word, know much would help. virus supposedly killed circulated ionizi... ionaisei... ionization system, much help someone coughs you. mask going offer protection. 

If mask stop spit, stop peoples spit? I'm cook Ohio. wear masks cook food. law specifically exempts cooks restaurant owners allowed make laws restaurants reopening. wear mask go pee, keep illusion, though. would like subscribe newsletter definitely case SF. feel bad families keep working undocumented folks trying get thru rn Well, ist kind case FFP masks, need fitted, form good seal hard wear piece two layered cloth mouth. point BLM rioting looting... wearing mask pointless.

Same goes ""social distancing"".

Time move on. Bet vaccine Every sixty seconds Africa, minute passes. Nice! always listen whatever government tells do!!! bunch dumbys people are!!! Right? course cases going continue climb. can’t exactly go reverse, they? don’t think it’s likely one day one diagnosed COVID time soon. It’s empty words. look numbers, beat east asian countries

By metric? only, ADHD ODD.

I hope make without much mental scarring. told someone yesterday eat inside restaurant.

Take-out? Sure.

Socially distanced outdoor eating area? Sure.

Will eat inside restaurant. thread lot links stats:  Fox News 99% lies deception. admitted court entertainment outlet only, relied upon factual news information. Anyone defending must literally stuck brainwashing Today exceptionally fucked. 10000 new cases US today compared last Monday (20 879).

Ok. 

Imma tell family go. hope people go stay away us tired administration politicized DOJ. Christ, dipshit.  Uh huh.. get sending $5 address back comic book? Same. system agreed live it. willing give stuff matters jobs expendable. 

That's gross over-simplification get idea. inability acknowledge things mean exist. oh look, saying ignorant stuff I’m glad bunch geniuses running country. Rural areas America stubborn selfish it’ll weeks hospitals collapsed they’ll recognize issue. Mask laws already disproportionately used arrest harass people color.

Meanwhile, white Karen's Chad's like, ""What mask law? freedom."" largely get away it. know, right?  family member immigrated ‘98, can’t get aboard. I'm NY Vermont I'd say key factors led NY flatten drop curve combination strict shut down, slow reopening (malls, gyms, gatherings 25 still prohibited), high rate testing tracing, mask mandates majority people follow. instance, I'm Upstate NY. even get hammered go grocery store Target, there's usually 1 2 people without masks.

It's interesting mods not. it’ll get tied litigation time it’s resolved things gotten crazy guess that’s last party. last waltz some?  sad. NYC open. still locked down. open get increases. There's safe way open.

That’s unlikely see death surge week two. LIGHT MOMENT

BUT PROTESTERS! I'm Florida! region country you?

So, think wearing mask reminds people crisis? I'm still trying figure part gone away. I'm Canada, like I'm US blame mask wearing politicized. they’re minority doctors. we’re still bit covid thing right ‘the urban areas.’ Well, get fear (yet) unfortunately... Please explain constitution anything this. think lot people, going bar allows distract lots things (loneliness, anxiety, depression, etc.) highlights mental health crisis ignored. 

I know miss bars mostly allowed socialize friends feel less alone. job time demanding spend time working alone day day gets really tough.

Not much. 4 consecutive 2 week periods seen declines deaths since peaked mid April. 

In time, low point new daily cases dropped 20% peak 

New daily deaths dropped 75% I’m TX they’re apparently “instant” antibody test along nasal swab.

Someone know fever 1 evening went get tested safe. tested negative antibodies swab ended coming back positive. Yeah, overwhelmed hospitals would still terrible drive death rate! think really changes way handle pandemic yet. 

I see lot arguments virus getting less deadly....that's wrong. Changes mortality changes/improvement treatment. I'm also sold FL changing numbers slightly coding deaths weird ways show lower death numbers. blindness make others blind. I'm glad able put foot down.

I hope stays way! Again, nothing discussing irrelevant. Denmark, people recommended get tested 5-6 days passed. covid new Kool-Aid early March grabbed cash often don’t case needed it.

EDIT: remember 9/11, everyone showed patriotism proudly waving American flags. beautiful thing. shame coronavirus result bunch masks American flag designs country, really would made proud. else would go down?

The way infections eventually die getting R0 zero.

You multiple ways

1. Forcing people limit physical interactions

2. People voluntarily limiting physical interactions

3. Herd immunity via mass infection

4. Herd immunity via inoculation

It doesn’t happen miraculously What's whataboutism!?

Yes, president single biggest culprit.

But excuse CDC Fauci promoting mask skepticism? China buying world's supply pikachu face Breathing spread virus too. Washing Soda Crystal's Methelated Spirit go solutions ...stuff testing . ..👍🤣 I'm also Austin happy hear initially, later heard businesses going enforce policy stores, instead choosing pay fines. Although, hearing 2nd 3rd hand, know much truth it, think much stretch imagine point. Canada treat people like heros. like listening updates bonnie Henry (bc) Denna Hinshaw (ab). way speak like child listening mom dole empathetic wisdom. can't imagine anyone threatening even harsh word health officers. 

Same can't said politicians though even regard, country recognize difficult job handed. time said done going looking hundreds thousands deaths.

That means ditch beard now. It'll grow back babyface. Good news good news. People getting better recovering good news people allowed happy that. want continue miserable fester worries paranoia guest. trying find something might make sense, goes: early pandemic, masks expensive useful medical personnel general public, since general public supposed home anyway. supposed about, everyone add additional layer protection allow reopen start. Doubtful unless things get insanely bad. People it, unfortunately. double plus good, yeah? Tiny monster kill! Bad! would Fauci lie? incompetent? Considering numbers cases seeing today people infected 1-2 weeks ago many states still arent damn thing actually flatten curve, numbers absolutely explode. 

In 2 weeks becomes clear late. takes 2 weeks lockdowns implemented results start filtering through.  think title ment acquired** say absolutely true. strain healthcare system could catastrophic. post mostly directed ask deaths increasing rate new cases are. :) *only* reason seem well supported. potentially 2 strains one China European one. So, better safe sorry… Lol hell? Nothing makes sense. dangerous COVID-19 way survive pass away it, exactly death rate better indicator infection rate book, people actually getting infected it? 

Death rate way better Florida moment it’s mostly younger people getting lower rate mortality. envelope pushed people keep going like infection rate problem, matter time hospitals get overwhelmed *and* older population starts getting well. recipe anything good, virus infectious I’ve always stated rate infection much threat mortality rate COVID-19. friend mine take wife hospital non covid issue. fairly large metro area like austin, ended take hospital clear across town closer ones capacity covid cases. crazy. ""more 40 California deaths waiting decision U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention whether test COVID-19.""

I really understand part. would need long decision process? even federal inaction, like counter-action. It’s borderline treason they’re willfully mismanaging right start. shame took tens thousands deaths realization... support massive protests social distancing point finger someone trying run business. take pause realize Nazi. (and big huge massive if) people board, suggestions work. people board, actual mandates penalties work. manpower go every grocery store, let alone every single place that's open, enforce things like masks.  still us? pretending coronavirus problem, administration admitted US fucked coronavirus policy, makes Trump look bad. Trump *hates* looking bad. election year, that's especially bad.

It's **saving face**. Even means deaths. Trump would rather million Americans die look competent, actually fix problem admit policies crap.

(Ironically, thing China doing, China want investigation much Chinese government covered things up.)

Saving face official policy incompetent governments. delightfully ironic misspelling. I'm saying made greatest decisions, made better decisions even needed to. I'm GA work week stopped SC east Columbia shit show. Gas station packed, signs saying entry without mask think saw single person one on.  resident rural Az, true, add fast conspiracy nuts think made take seriously all... bit perfect storm. Almost politicians face reckoning done. Hell empty, devils here. least people complying here. kind seasonings using? Newborn baby goats It’s actually weirdly shocking see almost perfectly lists track certain, um, ideological persuasion. mean, it’s clear p*liticized mask-wearing social distancing become, still I’m Northern California. asked doctor possible late February Covid. indicated Kaiser gone back tested 8000 samples patients California came flu symptoms collected January - February. 8,000 samples, two tests came back positive covid. indicated unlikely likely bad flu cold strain going around. Long Beach apparently doesn’t believe covid since majority people past days haven’t wearing masks coughing shit. Fucking gross. Literally one else wearing masks Shoreline Village. America!

Also Russia! Honestly public health heads need give up. don’t know exactly what’s going people give fuck. know doctors nurses don’t give fuck mentality “won’t happen me, nothing bad come personally. Idgaf anyone else.” sure solution is, maybe people sign waivers forfeit spot hospital someone actually tried? draw line? thought could applied morbidly obese people, smokers, etc. don’t know. People suck, country sucks, feels like isn’t solution. You’d act like you’re asking people drastically change way life asking wash hands, clean, WEAR FUCKING MASK. I’m bothered much. I’m starting feel Greta’s pain think. Yes well happens wont shedding tears. lead horse water cant make drink. knew, known, true.

Early on, took given that;

* Masks effective everyone use them.

...yet, also true...

* Masks short supply, greatest benefit everyone would prefer effective masks given people greater risk catching infection help others.

With mind, March, masks (some N95, better, worse) two things;

* kept small supply masks (some already used N95 vents (that plugged)) family. masks rotated treated contaminated sides removed.

* donated everything else ***(unused N95)*** local hospital. time mostly using basic pleated masks (the rectangular ones ear straps). Yesterday 20 states.  Oh man, perhaps worst time airlines relax.

And fuck customs. way friend’s cousin should’ve treated like that, especially pandemic.

I really haven’t paying much attention news lately. It’s really bad US, especially live, I’m confident we’re ready another coronavirus wave. 104 shootings Chicago weekend, 70+ NY. seriously going lie pretend happening?? Wut  sister law? Mine works nursing home, still goes beach, let's kids go peoples homes, never seen kids wear mask out. Made realize virus getting nursing homes everywhere. that’s always out. It’s trumps fault. Got it. Trump didn’t sign order force nursing homes take covid patients back. Cuomo one refused shut public transit like month even massive death numbers. response blame. It’s dishonest say positive test rate Florida “mostly flat.” positive test rate spiked past two weeks, reflects policies put effect 4-6 weeks ago. words, since state began reopening, positive test rate increased exponentially. comment history disaster Glad could help! :)  carbon dioxide poisoning mildew! /s Yeah, but...freedom!

/s top unprecedented lockdown still lost 120k Americans. thing ramps back gonna get even worse. I’m fence whether troll sort Orwellian character believes we’ve always war Eurasia  Ugh I've seeing that..like two teenagers. out. stay home. husband store. Msn go 8 go honestly gives creeps. forked 99 bucks years unlimited delivery certain store, go often would, friend. would. shit Sherlock wtf isn’t problem don’t know solution. kind sir, spoke majority country albeit unknowingly. Random fun facts anybody cares:

The preview picture shot Florian Kohfeldt, coach German soccer team Werder Bremen, breach relegated second time clubs history weekend. currently leading number years participating Bundesliga (a little fifty), missed single year season 1980/81. Bayern Munich, never relegated, second place joined Bundesliga years later Bremen did. Disney going strong phase reopen. Hoping half visitors attracted. Hot damn, that's exactly sort dumb thing tourist would do. Going Hawaii knowing there's 2 week quarantine instead cancelling first dumb thing. keeping family there, Hawaii ain't messing around. favorite couple quarantine went beach got caught cause posted photos Facebook. entitlement real. Lol Houstonian here. agree everything said. Terrified every day go office. aren’t allowed wear masks aren’t “client facing” hand washing keeping 6 ft apart “enough”. I’m idiots charge every level. party always claims follow science followed science American mindset today would World Wars. way domestic America eating spam recycling bullets, they'll protesting shit they've live way much comfortable life. Okay.... previous lie? handling pandemic &amp; lockdown India complete disaster humanitarian crises. clearly idea talking about. virus soon die parts US summer in. one remembers Reddit calling people dumb buying masks healthcare workers needed it? Overall bad yes, specifically COVID19 no. Definitely need careful though ""normal"" cases spike COVID19 putting concerning strain things. fear faster realize. upward trend gets larger larger daily. Local, state, national Gov messed big time. don’t think people comprehend headed immediate, urgent massive action taken cities/states seeing massive uptick cases right now.

I’m perplexed everyone continuing delay. weapon virus nearing full outbreak overrunning Hospitals stay home orders. areas beyond stage everyone wear masks go life. mandatory initial lockdown would much better/different place now.

I fear day going forward now, many people die didn’t to... right (and 100% proven) moves made.

Who kidding? It’s politics economy. I’m sorry! weak moment thought lives actually mattered. /s faster country required killing people, fewer people killed Psh, point, nothing value would lost. disgusting human absolutely redeeming qualities ever finally something useful give people headstone piss on, RNC scrambling find candidate run six months go election day. shed single tear. Mi corona es su corona Fuck it? trust worthy statistics regime supress freedom press? Fuck Joe Rogan. Overflow happened areas.. hospitals fine. Anytime two weeks two years? Beyond knows. 

As stands, tightening restrictions suppressed virus UK/Europe loosening increase spread? Nah prayers good thoughts. Someone hasn’t read South Sudan democratic republic Congo. us fucked don’t dismiss suffering people live actual third world countries. grocery store fine one security guard. guard stationed door (all doors locked) letting anyone without mask, workers inside ensure people keep masks on. Intersex exists infection rates low people stayed more, worked home

My girlfriend japanese, living Osaka. started working 2 5 days home April. majority japanese, never issued lockdown, suggested it. people talk less subway due culture

Even talk less subway, change squeezed inside wagon surrounded least 3 mouths less meter you. 3 mouths tipically covered mask.

I'm saying scientific. false equivalence. real difference low scoring countries high cases countries mask. bother, enough brain cells left syphilis... ain't added source, bad. right though supporters. political issue, common sense, follow science issue. common sense 2nd grade math?

more prevention = less death fuckin study lmaoooo Always has. MMR vaccines. since March. study goes masks: international travel bans also significant well lockdowns.

And personally, think using Chinese data pointless they’re without doubt lying infection mortality rates. 

It’s masks fucked US — it’s didn’t serious, enforced, widespread lockdown sooner. Memorial Day arrivals. people numbers, amounts, journalist majors. way gavin. way go.  hope napa trip worth it. Total bullshit response man. brazen misdirection government. nothing ""learn"" here, knew virus coronavirus that. mystery type virus, well studied type one causes people get sick caused sickness well got specific coronavirus.

It communicable via droplets, meaning moisture breath mucous coughing, sneezing, etc. 

Masks block it. Period. knew then, know now. lied. thought better lie prevent supply shortage tell truth.  249 countries regions similar status (waves RoC PRC). countless subdivisions, provinces, oblasts, Bundesländer, Cantons, counties, Regierungsbezirke, etc. entire dance ongoing since March. odds?

Say now? scene movie, we’d know ends. seriously thing reiterated again. There's discussion anymore, two million subs agreeing masks important circling identical arguments. 

This sub ran course, seriously. faster. would add kind people told us lies school times. I’m sure WH everything power suppress news. Hopefully beneficial spreading truth current situation. like Coovaid Germany tons people refuse wear masks  Due rescheduling, tickets already bought January-March 2020 scheduled Opening Ceremony July, refunds in. “Unwieldy phase”. Maybe shut unnecessary outings time being, require masks public start taking thing seriously instead shrugging 🤷‍♂️ it’ll probably become way wieldy. 

The headlines see like this, convinced live nation overgrown children.  He’s full shit wants cover. 🙄 fun watch No. I'm specifically looking COVID19 cases admitted. Hospital bed usage simply tells big picture. ICU charts everything ICUs always spike summer, especially around July 4th assume ppl want crazy dumb stuff via lockdown frustration. could also like Vietnam single person died 350 cases since beginning population 95million. 3/4 population already wears mask pollution factors. 

Who knew pollution could save lives... It’s really hard us. It’s hard explain helpless feel working COVID. isn’t much trying keep intubating them, means watch people struggle. 

The decisions hard. admit, transfer? allow someone’s family visit them? allow visit everyone knows why. know, patient knows it, family knows it. It’s like flashing sign saying “this last time you’ll ever speak again”. 

You live drama everyday, trying let bleed family life. Meanwhile Aunt Karen another Facebook rant grand conspiracy “it’s flu” don’t even energy willpower left tell go fuck  2000 likes know one cares ones hospital bed. Everyone shares two minute tirade #nomask one watch 12 hour video someone drowning body fluids granddaughter waving bye bye Nana fucking iPad. 

We don’t make videos anymore, hasn’t changed fucking thing. videos China didn’t stop happened Italy. videos Italy, didn’t prevent New York. horrors New York weren’t enough change people’s minds Texas. Sociopath, sure. idea wearing masks debate?? know ends. seven half million years thought, Fugaku tell us answer ultimate question life, universe, everything 42... Well sense right, protect getting it. protect everyone else you.  are. Probably vaccine coming late 2020. happened take 3 months reach rest country... yet wildly contagious..??

&amp;#x200B;

Process minute let said sink in.. Maybe upper middle class 3rd world country that’s think US shithole 3rd worlders like still want get even covid Right. mean, you’ve close enough contact virus it’s mask, wouldn’t rest too? would sitting mask? wouldn’t clothes hair face eyes already? things software jobs... wait ten years....what? already Pretty sure that’s said, semantics, eh. appointed trump. thing pisses people wearing ""it protect you""

But protect people it. We've known whole time! means everyone wore first place, we'd protected!

America failing spectacularly idiots mocked Japan, South Korea Asian countries practiced wearing masks. Told so. Australia told thing, never changed 104 deaths ~95% iirc 85 one 40.

NZ also require masks.

Masks alone reason, mistaking correlation causation. Masks help somewhat, make mindful hygiene, fact lowest infection rates deaths warm humid climates seems imply multiprong reason lower rates. American culture lot emphasis individual freedoms compared India. Awesome comparison Norway copied Denmark one day later. contact tracing app bad withdrawn. Officials recommend using masks people use correctly apparently need 200 000 masks avoid one contamination. least we're beating Sweden. Florida Arizona's graphs practically vertical lines point. miss California... I'm philly now. asian couple masks transit early Feb. poor couple got beated gang young African Americans. Quite unfortunate Texas opened everything including comedy clubs. Joe Rogan crew buying new compound relocate everything there. recent podcast Joe mentioned he's moving soon. still going move Texas Covid ravaging community WEED ILLEGAL? doubt it. bet he's moving state weed legal probably Colorado since homeboy Schaub Denver probably decent clubs play beeing crushed Pandemic quite bad Texas. Rogan needs quit sending Covid hoax vibe. millions listeners quite honestly message dangerous. I'm happy Bill Burr called Bullshit wish guests would balls Bill does. small mind. Trump administration recommend masks. duh? Exactly This. learning America part. Whichever want use. Death per capita, infection rate on. Hmmm... Kanto region alone 40 million... bring confidence mask people, wearing encourages you.

I still understand lie say helps lower chance catching it, seeing already lying mask effectiveness. People individualistic care others, completely normal human behavior. people really give shit customers supermarket? course not, told prevented personally catching it, everyone mask on.  ""Duh Doy!"" ~Pierce Hawthorne Yeah, three you. paper says .19%... really hard stuff comprehend credit him, one much literature protective effects potentially sick people wearing them, mostly looking protective effects people wearing them, arent great. Fucking lying scum!  looking wrong chart. want look at:

 Hospital Bed Usage &amp; Availability do. We're own. Goal #1: Keep neighbor healthy. Fuck all. Qualifying suspended October-November 2020. set resume November 2020 extending end June 2021.

There rescheduled 2020 US Olympic Trials next June. Swimming athletics wait. jump. never know, trying time market hard, right seems right. isn’t English. please use understandable language made mistake beginning Stand mid January. I’m still done, it’s freaking much. love analogy! 😂 right know saying they'll opening, time fall hits think we're gonna completely worse situation far cases/hospitalizations. I'd bank online main option, maybe option in-person care. That's bay area massive tech hub meant economy already shifted WFH-only well SIP started, went ahead first county enforce SIP happen across counties bay.

LA much, much larger extent Orange County basically pretended problem weeks later. thing “under-testing” told begining outbreak it’s waste time mass testing way proceed foward tell us feel sick symptoms. Stay home go outside. ones tested, medical staff, essential workers on. getting mass testings way. “confirmed” people likely already developed anti-body Covid. helps, guarantee success. Oh god worse thought. hit new 7-day rolling high week next, looks it, keep new plateau 35k go new record. maskless morons decide big lead get India Brazil. cluster mysterious deaths, involving infants children, scrutiny amid questions whether novel coronavirus lurked California months first detected. eight weeks Gov. Gavin Newsom declared statewide hunt undetected early COVID-19 deaths, effort remains hobbled bureaucracy testing limits.

Among awaiting answers Maribeth Cortez, whose adult son, Jeremiah DeLap, died Jan. 7 Orange County visiting parents. healthy, suffering Friday thought food poisoning, found dead bed following Tuesday, drowned fluid lungs. we’re seeing typical seasonality respiratory viruses North America. Influenza deaths diminish summer months well. theory. understand weird. 90 days 188 countries individual regions affected coronavirus.

I'm conspiracy theories, that's basic statistics see number 1,000 yield results much data available. prayed reopening it
didn’t happen. gives? gutless. He's pandering segment public adamant taking seriously. He's educated, wants public support. many people treating seriously. us live major Texas cities understand immediate threat. outbreak suburb started. traveled town past weekend, go, less anyone cares. wear masks. think city problem. Us city folk country dwellers mingle time. country counterparts see what's coming? don’t live together. high exposure job live mom high-risk demographic. We’ve seen distance it’s same. 😢 I’m accepting it’s really hard knowing there’s end sight things.  virus weakening, like common cold now.

That's official narrative folks (it's bullshit). Also, reading bulletin Taiwan, looks like advice travellers Wuhan, rather advice general public Taiwan. study based widespread masking became common recommended general public country. can’t ways. 

Either deny BLM protests spread virus therefore okay world reopening completely...

Or

You believe protests spread virus dangerous rate shows reopening world would put hospitals danger going beyond capacity. rest world, lots countries right, South Korea leading way.

I attribute western medicine raised assume fix it. 

Western medicine fix cause, battles problem. 

Masks, PPE, lockdowns; none come pill form.

It's cultural shift going happen one way another Turn phone upside look again. /s I’d like see definitive answers. Darwinism. 🤷🏻‍♀️ community garden tend to. retrospect, know would pandemic started garden.

And helps mark passage time I'm still self isolating.

But also get ton sun helps :) deficient, endo put mega high prescription dose prepare surgery. Well, pandemic. unsafe I'm forbidden take prescription. People states vacationing here. Ive seeing ton Nevada, Arizona, Utah plates everywhere 5500 California. states half 1 week ago.

And nationally, country returned daily cases absolute peak April. We're back square one pandemic, except time numbers peak...they're beginning ascent hill since many states involved lockdowns happening. No, assuming care sympathy believe problem. know thoughts heart unless share you. Judge much. Yeah like said Trump rallies ""open back up"" protests  Yes thought one person coming China? Conservs US self centered think whole world would conspire Dems make Trump look bad. doesn’t. China way many people accurate testing. amount Poor people unregulated food markets don’t scream safe hey know.... DC, MD, VA. states taking mask wearing seriously, beginning, areas not. downvotes speak thousand words. Rules thee, they're good US, also tier 3. /s I'm still working home Australia able take daughter school last 3 months entire life. running unemployment money

Nobody's running unemployment money. states responsible small portion it, $150bln appropriated states covid-related expenses used prop unemployment systems. find odd 43rd testing .. 5th cases low deaths? feel lied to. think deaths closer 6-8k. 2k crock crap.

It’s Jefferson county. hospitals overwhelmed virus. rural hospitals closed now. Beaumont full. think counting beds closed hospitals something. None numbers add up. True, prize either. could doctors getting better treating patients too. growth rate continues start seeing hospitals full. soon. within 2 weeks time.

+4800 cases TX today. comparison, one week ago 1586. Makes total sense cases COVID going down.... oh wait... 😱 Well, way article gives answers, though essentially guesses. know 5-10% need hospital care, 30% permanent damage 1.5-3% infected. Sadly, yet know long term health impacts need hospital care. county health officer county Cali opened restaurants dine services inside out. everyone around us it.. things based data.....Smh.. politics kills Masks see one Wuhan early on? nurse breaking screaming colleagues lifelessly eat food.

This must wear mask. save heroes save us need it.

This way. thought unexpected Futurama second. California took lockdown seriously.

Some parts did. London Breed issued SIP San Francisco week NYC even SF's tech employers moved full time WFH. think that's good goal have, theory, I'm certain that's far extreme could ever actually implement lifetime. Opening borders would certainly good first step direction. subreddit full hypochondriacs anxiety issues.  guys bone dingo asses. Spreads virus like cray cray. It’s tenth state wealth per capita, like 80%.  I'm really hoping gets covid! Really good info Taiwan. Thanks sharing. Genuine question. seems kind ambiguous says ""wear face mask seek medical attention symptoms develop"". mean everyone wear face mask public even asymptomatic, would count early universal masking date. mean mask apply symptoms, count towards universal masking. anything could help determine mean here? sources indicate universal public masking became common recommended Taiwan? authors could still update study since preprint server right now. live Oregon. town half wearing masks initial lockdown. things opening up, I'd say 5% people wearing masks (except employees). 

The kicker state currently new wave cases things worse they've ever been. nobody seems care! 

So many wearing masks... stop NOW?!?!? hard wear mask God sake? locked part Bejing 100 cases. explain ranking? largely brought CT New York. Covid circulating early Fairfield county New York. CT acted early dramatically flattened curve prevented many cases deaths . CT one states put politics subordinate public heath measures .  
People must take seriously , things go back normal rates declining areas. time cheapest health insurance could afford affordable care act enrollment. paid almost nothing.

Yes, cheapest plan available leave wallet hurting hospital stay. That's talking about. current health care insurance situation definitely fucked. Trump incredibly stupid. wants economy come back ought biggest supporter patriotic mask-wearing. It’s like cult members smart enough notice got done saying exactly opposite. half-baked theory (at least people) intimidated intelligent, science-minded people. don’t understand science basic facts people try tell things high-and-mighty, snobby, jerks.

So basically Idiocracy? graph look bad, slight upwards trend

*squints*

Ah crap, that's log scale :/ High bar there. Says lot great country is, suppose. Sounds like dont understand whats said reason, resorted lashing out.

How bout taking step back, shutting up, actually paying cent attention. I’m childless choice, people self define childfree online get really gross scary. Yeah yeah, screaming toddlers favorite restaurant annoying, yeah yeah sucks losing friends pregnancies pretend “accidents”, Jesus, childfree insular groups bloodthirsty terrifying. Last time looked anyway. something I’ll repeat. Tf about? don’t care—you’re calling racist bc it? good sign, looks like reopening going well hill want die on? Remembered arguing illegal immigrants called “illegals”? immigrants hard life is. happen NY. scary started. ever actually working hospital? certainly sound like it. I'm Florida we're neck neck Texas! Woo-hoo!

With projections coming pike states, starting think governors may end forced. every fiber being, yes. People need someone tell free thinkers. test foreign arrivals requires mandatory 14 day quarantine. It’s pretty much impossible introduce new infections country Surgeon General Jerome Adams disappeared never apologized explained mocked people wearing masks.  said “Seriously People! stop buying masks. effective general public.”  knew, known, true. 🙈 Well can't fix stupid ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  stupid fuck, also fat fuck. hospital UTI rates zero stopped checking urines infection. Seriously, threw spreadsheets graphs air said ""REOPEN EVERYTHING"". Hes giving supporters subtle chance die him. Yeah think fever staple flu; fever flu don’t think flu without fever. Last time flu temp well 103. You’ve described schools I’ve worked in, including one spent last three years in. 

Reopening schools scary. statement addressed. addressing false claim people starving death US covid. read report? align internal bias? Seriously. hard cook. understand people talking essential takeout food is. Buy groceries cook meals like everyone else. smug arrogant clearly important actually understanding points view own. real shame close minded bigoted, even depressing since almost certainly consider open minded individual. That's less eligible. end result systemic process businesses less eligible. disrespect please. probably joking, seriously think played role. said Tulsa, someone somewhere must pointed tested every day people around aggressively screened. And, hates called out, way could think respond cut back screening. power make happen, even every single one advisors pleading to. Exactly thought... people around live aren’t taking seriously anymore. I’m gonna go watch movie again. Thank reference lol. misleading. decreasing. literally right there. No, large portion not. Stop. making facts ridiculous. 80% normal capacity well. I'm trying mean maybe need breather. sure fighting facts positive relation COVID19 hospitalizations AZ alarming. Korea small country like New Zealand. heck Koreans detect couple dozen cases population 50 million? think states opened US sort monitoring plan place.  I'm really proud downstate NYer. I'm really proud fact vast majority people keep neighbors safe.

I'm really proud number people stepped contribute food banks. I'm unspeakably proud first responders essential workers put line keep skeleton civilization afloat past three months, often without benefits considerable risk.

It's easy Monday-morning quarterback talk mistakes, honestly, nobody knew hell going early days, thought shutting NYC anything pretty insane. Manhattan 9/11 remember talk evacuating island day. unthinkable then, remains unthinkable today that's roll. 

NYC international magnet many things - one day deliberate evil terrorist attack, next day far innocent desire experience place tourist without realizing packed deadly virus carry-on bag.

I wish we've gone anyone world, truly. I'm worried sick parts country taken seriously. basically told us pound sand go bankrupt, even mean you. Please wear mask. Please wash hands. 

If yourselves, doctors nurses cops EMTs firefighters grocery store employees bus drivers everyone else shows every day need them. way hell worse current situation. stand original statement. point doctors nurses say goodbye. point, we’re abusing honor professionals. aren’t going line slaughter forever, one lift finger make minimal mitigation efforts. send things, treat. DM list I’ll can, you’re comfortable so. I’m creepy guy, old broad loves someplace people taken seriously, numbers low. :-) seriously worried him. high risk age virus. thats horrible. Masks low effort thing, yet seem really effective spaces like public transportation markets. Well, unfortunately many indecent people Berlin meant Easter 2023 it’s new measures come...because Texas slowing ok, stop testing altogether zero confirmed cases! Ayyyyy, fellow laid product photographer, up! 90% rental cars running BC plates non BC plates rental canada direct USA, another big tell arn't rentals personalized ""window stickers"" things hanging dash rental cars Sometimes wonder would’ve better government force/tell people *not* use masks/be careful get-go—maybe *then* people would’ve listened? knows point lol Anyone else audio issues video? seem want play speakers although spotify working. Funny enough 17 cases 24 hours smallest increase we’ve seen last 10 days. averaging around 30-40+ new cases day. don’t know sudden ‘news’ worthy KCDC confirming experience second wave. concerning Seoul wasn’t really tested first wave. 
 
Here chart last ten  Wttttffff. That’s insane. would love right, I've learned anything whole pandemic underestimate peoples' willingness completely selfish, especially money involved. Whatever company finishes first viable vaccine make unimaginable amount money it.

I guess I'm basically saying I've completely lost faith humanity. Erm. mean 40 edge 40 year old friends. It’s old. perhaps is, millennials getting old now. Portland. compartmentalizing normalizing wars worth deaths could greatly reduced politicians cared people represent political careers average person cared life others mildly inconvenienced mask super sickening makes realize majority America significant tragedy, turmoil, sacrifice, hardship lives. going last forever.. needs Stafford Act could slow testing instead. suppose worded wrong. sure people know someone heard people community sick one personally know infected. course nursing homes hit extremely hard along big families seems likely lot cases may sadly care facilities mainly hitting areas hit first wave (though hate ""waves"" language, really applicable) “pulmonary complications” Covid unrelated? Cause panic inducing. Panic sells. 2000 cases alone Harris County. Yeah gas tank well kind useless asymptomatic..... dunno. Seems like news, since Church putting hundreds lives risk. sources also reporting this. lockdown plan laid changes since then, them.

With mask, put once, forget it. California shut early, wouldn’t necessarily say strict. Newsom seemed hesitant enforce anything, relying peer pressure, didn’t work.

From article speculative best. claiming scientific, bring scientific data

For comparison NYC/NJ 1500 deaths per day. FL/TX/AZ 1/40th it. matter, much manipulate, can't hide 40x numbers Exactly. Multiple calls per day decade now. would anyone answer phone anymore? never thought would thankful Brexit. dont cases dont test /tapsforhead think would bragged defeating virus nothingburger. way get people stay home would declaring Marshal Law saying Ebola states spreading. would probably keep 90 percent Americans property except grocery store runs. hate people say “hospitals aren’t even near capacity” like that’s hospitals supposed Right. Obviously. meant ask confirm anything like address, birthday, etc identify you. looked things dont know yet. (Will hubs heads bed), biggest differences see are, opened gyms. not. 

You guys also offering full dine restaurants. allowing patio service, even spaced allow distancing. (Take delivery always available)

I impressed masks required front facing employees (personally think required everyone), yet here, recommendation instances. requirement (unless salon type place) two staff members tested positive rally right? pretty sure he’s fully loaded anti-virals one work, paying taxes? concerns running conspiracy theory. completely left field makes sense. honestly still wonder though sort biological weapon. happened actually disproven kind Oddly enough I'm worried visiting church either.

Hey, genius! Taiwan lock need to! community spreads. Oh, want accept “personal responsibility”? never happen. dramatically testing last time 30k/day, too. Hmm.. wonder *why* Funny... remember CDC saying masks help... agree. also think young people vast majority new cases, lagged spike deaths hospitalizations large last time.

Also way Texas counts hospitals beds would never run out. way work one hospital fills start directing patients next hospital forth - ideally - nothing ever gets full earlier beds open new ones close. Ideally. Covid could stress that. that's point. Unfortunately, way disease evolved completely different family humans. direct experience draw upon.

Absolutely incredible!

And apparently non-reversible. get past paywall: http://archive.is/4B35x You’re giving lot credit think he’s thought past “a lot people cheering church! Awesome, like I’m God” Yeah need shame fuck them. better way get people take time feel sick affect political change, tsk tsk many people ignore symptoms though haven’t deliberately set society forces work sick. wish people passionate testing.  US, testing effort fucking pathetic. Democracy worst. Democrats outnumber Republicans Texas now. Texas Dems actually showed polls, could kick incompetent, evil fucks out. Agreed. think never closed good enough. SARS would like word

How much cdc receive funds every year say stupid shit? saying god, Jesus Christ liar? done slow spread? worst country planet containing this? correlation countries required masks early countries aggressively took measures? needed, rules use strict much hassle get used. Canada require masks much issue. mostly common sense, stay home go limited people. rocket science. country recognize Taiwan country? Good chance doesn’t. Darwinism.   Unless N95 mask better (ie surgical cotton mask), mask really going protect you.

The mask stop spit getting onto people.

So relax, put mask without much fuss, worry getting perfect seal, make sure blocking breath spewing directly onto people.

The mask people, wearing encourages you. wowww!!!! NOWAY Seriously, whoever writing trolling right? know saying outrageous stuff strippee context generates lot engagement Lyft Lux driver here. mask? Enjoy walking. Hope raining. 50 thousand people probably died changed mind Hello, original comment make sense. tons protests Chicago numbers still going down. Unless N95 mask better (ie surgical cotton mask), mask really going protect you.

The mask stop spit getting onto *other* people.

So relax, put mask without much fuss, worry touching it, make sure blocking breath spewing directly onto people.

The mask *other people*, wearing encourages you. Seriously white Americans like this. disappointing . Yeah... almost 40% past 2 weeks serious damned problem cannot blamed solely 'more better testing'. blamed one thing: spread dangerous virus.  threw shade didnt want people hording wear incorrectly doctors needing literally bake sanitize aunt takes arthritis, shes healthy middle age woman, side effects easy deal with. Itd good effective tho Aussie say response red hot garbage combination luck location suppressed virus far. Yeah Arizona decided didn’t care liberal hoax blown way proportion. “White people regimes”. That’s vague statement. Provide facts, examples. dangerous statement. I’m white, believe everyone wear masks “BuT StUdieS?”  washing hands touch anything face, face. 

The mask protect others. less protect wearer. He's trying lure tourists deaths order make buck. I'm surprised good portion people know. A. dont answer phone B. gonna helpful slightest random government person trying track they've around. Wait. I'm conservative advocating people wear masks since March company went entirely WFH.

Your blanket statement assuming me? need adopt bullying mentality towards anti-intellectuals anti-mask people. Civility done nothing get people killed instance. Quiet, end specially rendered realized can't lockdown state without serious long term consequences. Wait what? considered Chicago city? Thats assuming hands didnt pick anything White people regimes early stages: assaulted Asians wore masks. 

Why upvoted. racist. Sure handful crazies acted crazy comment trying conflate bad entire white people/nations. Bunch spoiled brats No, Thailand restricted democracy. democratic than, say, Iran Russia much India. Anyways, authority lock already vested elected official regardless. understand many full democracies authority well. question much ""can it?"" ""are willing it?""

You see, multitude factors cultures experiences, Thai people alert pandemic. fact, back early March, pissed government declare lockdown already. 

When people attitudes like that, lockdown part hard. matter help adversely affected measure. (They settled direct fund transfer month.) He's president man. I'm sure gov doctor sneaks vitamins food somehow.  Due lack testing, millions cases included confirmed cases previous months. 2 million cases estimated NY end March based antibody study. add 2 million cases plus states untested cases, June’s numbers lower. confirm butch: clipping hair much easier looks! want top longer tie/ pin shave part. got guards won’t hurt 👍🏻👍🏻 use two mirrors see back head go feel :) wasn’t saying take military money put magic machine automatically produce food. saying fact military budget high means nation financially capable 3 week complete lockdown knock virus. mind blowing many people realize much calculated based data. Also keep mind many, !omg term damage noticed later - lung damage gets noticed exercise heavily get exposed much pollution. Gyms closed sparsely attended fight many working home. Kidney damage might take longer show up, takes time accumulation toxins noticed minor damage.

Check back six months year. show true percentage people effected. virus, even need really care that. cotton/surgical mask probably going protect *you*, precautions about.

If trying prevent spit getting air peoples' lungs (which point masks particular pandemic), put mask old way. Yet still frowned upon throw shade towards WHO. breathing the, I'm guessing, nineties aughts put viruses everyones air? parents say ""don't breathe public"" say ""cover mouth *when sneeze*""? one trying equate two dramatically different takes public hygiene. welcome dramatically different take, see need argue same. wash soap least something dissolves fats. Since virus layer fat, disable washing. indeed, touch it, since virus hands keep inhaling gets masks. virus very, small get mask (unless N95) outside long time.
_never_ see mask line defence. Social distancing regular hand washing first Going beach isn’t crowded it’s extremely low risk, quite healthy. number people saw open government forum masks shrieking God made bodies process oxygen remove carbon dioxide, supposed mask on??? terrifying. Like genuinely understand oxygen carbon dioxide smaller viruses pass things like cotton, that's doctors nurses survive mask face 8 hours straight. 

They genuinely panicked could make connection. allowed education country fail badly. dishonest shenanigans make elected official seem loathsome villainous. F-F-F-Feudalism! Negatory, friend - joking. ""Correlation imply causation"".

Denmark cases mostly opened completely.

It never mandatory wear masks here.

It's probably tell people required wear masks, there's good chance government authorities take epidemic seriously - puts various interventions closure, public education etc. They’re undocumented they’re illegal broke law. Orwellian doublespeak? facts truth hard accept?  So... accusing taking virus seriously enough considered seeing family member decided engaging risky behavior? Maybe take time away subreddit, man.

If decided never see another living human vaccine created that's cool guess. 3 small kids family.  Maybe want face covered really good looking. take compliment. heard flu drug Avigan able reduce viral loads considerably mild moderate cases. India Russia even started manufacturing local versions it. Godzilla fucking stroke trying warn people died meant actually happen? Money. Probably blood swapped youthful blood. 

Just plasma. kind that's chalk full antibodies SARS2.  TV production. Soundstages booked 100% capacity  Expat still Korea considered leaving back things started heating up. wild watching reaction go ""come back States"" ""holy fuck stay are"" big concern OBX hospital capacity, believe. That’s annoying. understand need privacy it’s situation like this, seems people contact person right know potential exposure. god damn problem wearing mask, touching people, maintaining god damn distance folks. sign country willing batten hatches immediately. country willing going check anti-pandemic boxes hurry too, whether best thing particular virus not. Speed essence early days. Let’s face it, zombies already taking West. You’ve used lot facts common sense here, TV commercials Arizona says current economic problems Mark Kelly, never served Senate. Martha McSally *always* anti-China she’s going “hold China accountable.” (For taking jobs gave guess. don’t fully understand mechanisms we’re supposed believe right now.) gonna throw another thing ya...

Does private office windows open strong breeze / good air exchange w / outside?

If not... office pretty much sharing room whoever else a/c system. happened before. dark age end Bronze Age; previously literate societies, like Greece, went completely dark, places survived, like Egypt, badly diminished. Dark Age thinking reversion Dark Age. ""The water exposed skin, wet got: study"". I’m thinking 250k sometime August:( Joe Rogan truly sucks now.  /r/asablackman lot luck involved indeed. 

Yes. lot action also made massive difference likely still make huge difference long run. fact managed contain well already community transmission testament effectiveness measures implemented sacrifices we've made beat thing.

But, less lucky first place, measures would nearly effective. government still twiddling thumbs trying convince everyone ""wasn't bad"" ticking time bomb, even early days restrictions lot poor decisions fortunate suffer from. bought 10 N95 masks late January saw shit get real Seattle. think would bad, long... We’ve gotten get think Santee checking in. here. People everywhere without masks. El Cajon weekend Haha fuck read, don’t like them. face masks. knew that. articles like never mention countries like Indonesia seriously affected dengue.

The problem Corona dengue tests cross-sensitive. Corona issue dengue tests developed Corona mutation new approved properly test available.

The photos graveyards look horrible blaming deaths Corona might leads wrong conclusion country dengue 1000% infected people Corona.

Singapore publish new data regarding dengue outbreak. Singapore breaks every week former dengue record. Corona never burden hospitals, dengue now. That's hope, even damn talking ""no immunity"" long time get little paranoid. Yeah Brazil totally coronavirus shit train don’t get stupid mask wearing culture US. see someone wearing one don’t think “wow strong” think “what selfish asshole”.  lockdown 4 months now. thanks surging cases area (Southern California) looks like going more. time leave house 1 day month get prescriptions, 1 day week go aunts house cook her. whole time wearing mask. ""Anywhere else"" general statement true. lot ignorant people Russia. federal government afraid implement proper quarantine measures nationwide help. 

I saw barbershop maskless barber asking client take mask procedure. I'm pretty sure leaders taking lighthanded approach realize virus, left unchecked, fix social security. count? Asian countries regard elders keepers knowledge, experience tradition

Why people keep parroting Reddit like sort gospel? wore masks sensible thing do, blowhard boomer told us to. need mention Asia, respect, honor, hurr durr Confucius sentence becomes magic spell conjures upvotes.

Not mention comments South Korea successful Covid-19 people obedient government. talking country overthrew military dictatorship late 80s, violent protests year year 2000s (with shit like impeached last president threw jail. Compare US, can't even get embarrassingly corrupt president office, takes someone dying finally get asses streets protesting system reformed ages ago. obedient ones?

I can't speak East Asia, cursory knowledge real politics, culture, society South Korea makes immediately obvious ridiculous statements like one quoted are. expect foreigners familiar details, like conservative Liberty Korea Party suffered landslide defeat months ago legislative elections partly due getting associated heavily kkondae/teulddak image (read: bull-headed boomer). fact, need familiar anything all; bit awareness nonsensical assume entire population beholden arbitrary dogma told middle school making ridiculous generalizations like that. Well, won't. legal speed would see people flying fucking place. legal pay taxes nobody would. government mandated ABS, seat belts, airbags accident fatality rates would still abysmal. Anything inconvenient government mandated, way is. reading health devices broadcasting coronavirus outbreak anyone looking data. ones measure heart rates detected upswing resting heart rate virus started surge. I'm sure combine data together, get pretty damned clear picture started. country live made mandatory wear masks supermarkets early lockdown provided free store. We’re 500 cases nationally everything pretty much open here. “Beating up” 

You must think 1960s Vegas already transfusion anti-bodies care supporters? Ruby princess fuck traced prevented getting control.

Other countries close borders too. Australia massive tourist destination happened peak summer. like people come here. Maybe it’s helpful think way.

1. aerosolized particles: talk, laugh breathe, particles breath float air, wear masks minimize expelling inhaling other’s breath, may include COVID.

2. surface-to-surface contamination: get virus touching touching eyes, nose mouth. mask extension nose, definitely don’t want touch mask either. 

Imagine someone COVID sneezed hands touched everything grocery store. linger days. get hands touch grocery cart handle, door handle milk carton. helps imagine world though everyone green paint fingers — surfaces would covered green paint, wouldn’t much paint? don’t want touch eyes, nose, mouth mask touched really green things, unless you’ve washed sanitized hands first. 

To keep simple, helps touch things don’t to. wind blows mask, haven’t touched anything since left home, I’m terribly worried touching mask adjust it.

I haven’t heard anything clothing-based transmission. think you’d sniff clothing risk this? Still waiting Canada smarten up.

Dr Bonnie praised BC helps cover covid outbreaks. convinced anti mask preference US due commercial facial recognition interests. Hard sell government contracts facial recognitions 50 cent piece cloth defeat it. Wow. would guessed Maybe. agree protests. 

I’m pointing fact protests likely led lot increased cases despite flawed study says. far know data Italy, tested October/November water found nothing. December find virus. Yeah. got one unmasked people breathing air sometime past 2 weeks. Correlation = causation. real cause could example countries required masks quickly took measures quickly whole Latin community absolutely getting wreaked. Jfc.

(If link correctly scroll map USA, click California, scroll little way back Nailed? Seems excessive. Tape would done job. theory someone could put raw Covid water water gun spray 50m away maybe never leave house. Good job accolade would give member UK Government! 2 sexes, anything else genetic mutation. rioting civil war neighbouring countries (yet) refugees storming boarder United
""Joined together politically, common purpose, common feelings."" well shit US, pretty much everywhere. Back December 2019 made trip IKEA Moscow, shortly became sick see doctor *a month later* condition improving.

Dec 10: Sore throat.

Dec 11 - 20: Headaches, muscle weakness, nasty chills, fever weird feeling there's something itchy right lung.

Around time developed cough; symptoms gone late December: *""I think I'm getting better, time assemble thing bought IKEA.""* 15 minutes later found slightest physical stress makes feel itchy feeling lungs; muscle weakness also returned immediately.

Early January: Cough gone... thought. Every time tried speak, interrupted spasm made gasp air / cough little bit.

Jan 8: visited doctor. Chest X-ray revealed signs obstructive pulmonary disease; got antibiotics prescribed (spoiler alert: shit).

Jan 16: Another visit doctor. CT scan recommended me, decline irradiated pretty badly (20 mSV) abdominal CT months before.

Late January: *""I think I'm getting better real time... Damn, forgot like feel healthy.""* Positive test rate could indicator, variables proves difficult own. vacuum increase positive test rates would strong indicator increasing infection rates across sample. 

The problem vacuum number variables hard model against. example, back March april wind cold/flu season everyone sniffle cough thought Covid bunch people getting tested rhinovirus, flu, bacterial maybe even something non pathogenic like allergies. 

With cold/flu season people ill better odds CV ails opposed spring likelihood contracting usual suspects much lower mid summer months compared late winter spring. Australian wildfires likely caused massive reduction tourism, luck found from... well... bad luck. disagree masks purely don’t like it

what Good question. Demand pacing supply packing facilities across country shutting positive cases would guess. remember two weeks schools delayed, prep school required everyone wear masks, let in. HOLY SHIT WAY! supporters enable lying orange piece shit everything does... bleep you! SMH. Yep. I'm nearby county recent clusters around two different family gatherings. People think safe since family, stuff couple dozen people house. course, there's huge cross-section ages (the young old). 100% agree you; HOWEVER public acknowledge risk groups. lot mid aged people underlying issues old people start dying. personally think going lives opening bars, restaurants allowing people dine risking lives upon lives. non-essential businesses, get - peoples livelihoods trying shut federal government needs step assist.  research say immunity, though. Many people late fall early winter something

Probably flu. Science! *cheers soylent mine Tldr: California fucked correct. neighbor laughing fit &amp; children wearing masks! someone friend group posted sick people afraid ""corona virus,"" another works hospital upset (a high risk household) go home hang out. Bruh, get program.  health officials lied effectiveness masks ""save healthcare workers"" forgot basic math: something that's doubling every week, want whatever slow down. 

Discouraging people wearing masks means eventually overwhelm healthcare system. Whoa  That’s ban, straightaway. Never mind fact Pence killed 100K plus. said something mean natural need faster YOU! Well bad government CDC told us almost there, close! knowledge virus evolves time. previously assumed virus spreads easily, extremely aggressive contact tracing (South Korea) complete lockdown (China, Italy) could contain spread. Therefore move simple reopening could seen reckless.

However, know example social distancing mask wearing also options work, longer consider reckless reopen measures place. *However*, clear even basic defences aren’t observed States, it’s easy see declining numbers leftover lockdown period, rather indicator future.

Perceptions works doesn’t might yet change new data examples, thus far appears simply going regards protection bad idea — even part population observing it. Asian countries regard elders keepers knowledge, experience tradition

KC, Nashville, St. Louis, Las Vegas, San Diego, Tampa, city cases really rising :( Lucky ruby princess didnt cause widespread community transmittion, would say so. mask representations coordinated. Fauci saying thing. wonder whether Adams Fauci unilaterally decided say masks work, whether sign-off administration approach.    
I think hearings this.  particular, different approach available, giving correct advice public masks utilizing something like Defense Production Act restrict sale medical grade masks hospitals.    
At time, New York City experiencing outbreaks, think people entitled correct advice. IDK man, study seemed pretty eye opening leads towards masks pretty sweet macro level. Especially table Grey lines B.) C.) mandatory face masks implemented Italy NYC respectively. Maybe think systematic racism black men killed cops work risking virus 0.26%~ fatality rate. people really saying one saw coming? Genuinely curious. handling well all.

Lunatics think locking hard early possible handling will.

If country 200 Covid deaths 500000 deaths due lockdown measures.

And country B 250 deaths total Covid related

Half lunatics sub would praising country well handled things. Initially, covid’s scary. bf wanted quit working dialysis nurse dialyzing covid patients ICU ER rooms stable enough/not respiratory distress. whenever dialyze covid patients, feel like felt pre-covid. Yeah, still wear PPEs mentally/physically exhausted all. go 5 different hospitals. Humidity maybe!  tf supposed owe employer money using vacation time? sounds illegal. state mandate pay unused vacation time, can't allow use vacation time make pay back. 

I hope given misleading information. UK 🇬🇧 looks stupid. compare Arizona true. havent thought way while. actually shutting travel, closing borders, strict quarantine measures enforced, massive amounts testing, ton contact tracing. 

But no, pure luck. Meanwhile Sweden still require masks. Apparently help. anyone remember government agencies telling people wear masks lol apple.news may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It's not. sympathies you. Please stay safe can. definitely actions assholes China led report problem. previous diseases Taiwan South Korea prepared. intelligence leaders countries led successful.

Nope, racist stereotype asains (like 2 billion people) succeeded countries failed others. UK, mask wearing shunned beginning pandemic we're getting gaslighted stupid excuses like ""we want everyone wear save supplies NHS"". Another one daily articles make think. Ok, suprise suprise. Yeah simple. Good luck people follow bullet points July 35°C  true. Many countries reopened rapidly Denmark masks seen increase cases. Decline deaths necessarily masks. scientific studies proves masks work. fact it’s contrary told health experts early March buy them. absolutely can. like 4G 3G towers fans go bad. However, became issue 5G due high tower density. literally research result mind. good ones... dad travelled world teaching english 8 years exchange food place crash. Could get 14 languages. Got home got masters degree biology raising teaching. got rare cancer 10 could never adult conversation him. appreciate fuck them. lot us mad. admitted saying wear masks beginning bc administration afraid we'd buy masks medical shortage. dishonest. could wearing homage masks along saw social media, must true. certainly regards looking footage online...yeah, there, judging I've seen online know made right choice use multiple sim card plans popular due stupid plan policies. Often people need use one plan phone one data baseline need use multiple plans due work travels. worst part plan thay often 'localised' restricted city province. fee three standards, local(your local city, say new york), local province(say new york state), national(USA). even possible switch different provider number 2019. Yes. according resident spokesman WHO, that's really important. sources dumbass spewing bunch bs fun reading comments... come back later Imagine living cities expensive real estate, family four 2 kids stuck 1-bedroom apartment months end especially young kids sounds like nightmare. remember reading cdc saying masks much? don’t think that’s true. definitely saw people wearing masks, thought extra careful. wanna know many new positive cases reported Austria.  Someone follow Twitter lost mom. hospital visitors policy, even *those* instances. managed talk hospital allowing visit, can't imagine heartbreaking battle would fight. 
 
I'm sorry go this, compounded fact people STILL taking even basic precautions. infuriating. think masks tend become sort like 'sole topic' pandemic there's focus use relative importance. Australia much different setting US, anecdotally almost eliminated virus without general mask use (some people wear many). believe (and personal opinion) lockdown strict also required masks population, would much worse state. People say Australia isolated island smaller population, truth pretty congested cities (Sydney Melbourne) could definitely gone much worse us. 

The current state we're (in Australia) almost nothing masks, willingness adhere strict government policies lockdown. Luckily wealthy country actually afford we're told survive. Although admittedly think fair amount luck involved there's also location aspect Australia. Awesome!! wish people attitude! Keep good work. Honest question wouldn’t country requires mask show taking coronavirus seriously factors also play? MaSkS dOnT wErK!! quaratine requirements carried besides tracking license plates? take enormous human effort. Ok, looked  site link article. scared number Covid cases Brazil tests done. Spain here. Super strict lockdown. Nothing open, exercise, leaving house reason medical, pharmacy, food shopping. $600 fine did. Finland:

-No masks
-Just common sense social distancing
-No new infections
-Not racist Asians despite Chinese scamming us masks

Explain totally forgot olympics Don’t take advice people. sounds like you’re everything need do. According logic can’t building people share central AC complete BS. Keep you’re quit asking fear mongers opinions idea ionizer works. particles air because, particles drawn stick EVERYTHING. people going covered fine COVID-19 paste. Great see Florian Kohfeldt getting shit once. Ha ha, don’ mind SARS presented obvious symptoms shortly infection, that’s contained.

Masks good now, weren’t SARS eradicated. really serious think shitshow administration would think early on?

They fired pandemic teams dragged feet whole damn time. I've done look footage online. I've attended actual protests 95% people wearing masks social distancing. Giving masks providing hand sanitizer large focus. easily get COVID test Planned Parenthood Arizona (as well states). blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

FIFY. Canadian health authorities repeated / CDC / Surgeon General saying masks. damage here.

When go shopping (Calgary) maybe 10% people wearing masks. What's scary much govt lying. expect all. knew would happen, lies? Situation way worse imagine. I've watching closely local release stats health department area. really seem onto data, reporting daily etc etc.... town small. see single positive case reported week ago, first thought nice govt onto this, week later I'm wondering where's rest positive cases contact tracing etc? impossible 1 positive person infect atleast another person. lies. Soon Germans deleting Indian stats public forums like China. ""They lying anyway, whats point including them"" protestors wearing masks. makes sense. seen footage protests??? There's way people infecting other. Fearing things get political reason blamed BLM protests media. virus doesnt care something worthy cause buying new sneakers, matters close contact others. rational person honest would say protests responsible increase cases haven’t local confirmed cases almost two months now, government still forces us wear masks entering official facilities, people seem understand measure took everyone still consensus wearing masks whenever public space, feel proud country totally agree what’s said article. Always spotter. safe word. say protests might increase cases future. said already did. made objectively false statement corrected you. Wearing masks likely one reasons seen spikes protests yet. Also, tend outdoors people tend maintain distance other. know factors limit spread virus. Can't recoveries infections...In Bed. Austria instance reacted fairly early hardly need wear masks anymore. bus doctor, etc. Life honestly completely normal. needs competent government consense average human intelligent science professionals (wear masks!). You’re complete puckered asshole. Wait... trying say medical science right along? Sounds like leftist conspiracy me. 
/s (it sucks actually need include this) evidence based medicine struggles. Ignorant people think science better scientists doctors. CDC narrative masks used general population something never accept. ""not enough evidence"" one thing, actively told everyone wear them.

There's technically, ""not enough evidence,"" tumeric cures cancer. That's negative evidence works. Yet docs mostly say work. shorthand data support it.

There's lot philosophy theory behind process developing guidelines communicating them. real failures along way. egregious ones jerome saying masks work. ones think ignorant whole debacle. Put charge we'd get worse science. trouble idea why. that's fine. That's doctors scientists exist require literally years train. nah, get bro. read like 3 articles it. Face shields good health care workers, lot exposure virus (and stuff).

Contagion eyes seems thing shields help with, far seems like less likely form contagion. 

Not american btw, probably see 1 50 people street face shields, mask mandatory kind, around $100 usd get caught.

And cops hungry tickets, car traffic down, traffic tickets. Pretty much gameplan UK too. June start quarantining incoming flight passengers (it optional), requiring people wear face masks public transport. 

Things US nowhere near bad yet, I'm sure they'll catch eventually! govt could made public stores ship supplies redistributed (first locally needed most) needed medical industry available healthcare workers. It’s hard. solves issues simply. 

Organizing something like would simple cheap. inept government comes protecting citizens fucking joke. chose lie public order cover ass sheer level systemic ineptitude. complete asshole Savage spot-on. Love this!! masks rotate. long let mask sit week unused. That’s I’ve done it’s getting thrown away. sure best thing I’m sure folk may disagree say bin it’s option me. absolutely impossible IFR low. Antibody testing UK Spain shows 1.0 1.5. US Prison almost everyone got virus showed 1.2 think It’s amazing could type much say little. isn’t “zero evidence.” evidence literally plastered every conference trump repeatedly said fauci didn’t see eye eye. Holy shit, that’s enough you? think disagree god damned president United States life threatening illness wouldn’t create pressure? Seriously man can’t. You’re either disingenuous consciously ignorant can’t reason disagreeing trump could create significant pressure concern. You’ve got roughly 8 years twitter comments prove wrong. Look graveyard staffers talks shit about. real? You’re actually believing this? I’m done..you’re choosing ostrich hole two fucking months squandered entire thing, MUCH WORSE first wave tail economy shredded.

This nation's ideology, mostly one side, essentially destroyed country. WAY, THINK? East Asian countries talking about. East Asian countries China, Mongolia, Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong maybe Vietnam. much better Germany. Anyway again, people probably infected even know it.

No, based anti-body tests high infection areas number uninfected people even very, high. real headroom virus spread. Please continue contributing happening explosive manner Italy NYC. Singapore mandate masks public late March. low death rate among top infected countries imposes travel restrictions social distancing requirements many places US. Scotty still telling us planned going rugby Mayor LA imposed full lockdown, example. Yes, testing ramped quicker- brief period near top world testing per capita- luck/ geographic positioning absolutely major factor well Aus. Luck bought us time get act together- secondary decisions approach contact tracing, reporting natipnal collaboration quite good initial stages. economic response actually much much better health one- jobkeeper + increased jobseeker key ensuring people financially secure staying home, acknowledging even still perfect systems. still remember day visit 6 different convenience stores got three masks Honestly stupid might well exploit never help themselves. attitude changed much since pandemic begun, trust anyone. Everything said correct, except masks effective personal protection. Masks completely useless preventing wearer getting sick, that's main reason wear them.

Masks protect us group helping prevent spread disease **from** infected. Masks good reducing range droplets infected person spread around. LMFAOOOOO need study that, isnt common sense??? Uhhh, cos probably live USA. countries cultural norms government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased average 8.0% week, compared 54% week remaining countries. 

The abstract paper: Gotta wonder they're trying hard pull flood internet attempting discredit it. Actually watch whole thing decide yourself. Remember 911 inside job. Jet fuel melt steel beams. much effort ban everywhere. let people see it. yet people still wearing masks US think live bit reposting. weeks, streets empty shops closed cities across China millions people stayed curb spread  Xu Yuanhong, 35, runs garbage-sorting company Beijing, business never better.  people stay home, time hands produce rubbish,” said Xu, whose company Ai Fenlei processes 800 tonnes rubbish every day.

I said say again: family's safety. IDGAF anyone thinks lol. Everyone possible stop spread California one. course, wanting politically correct one blame protests.

Science, politics. Everything said DISEASE TRANSMISSION. Stop throwing word ""politics"" everything disagree appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* certain portion people (probably significantly large portion) would interpret mean wearing mask like invincibility potion, start hugging, visiting friends, sharing food, drinks, needles etc. would argue hygiene general much better Japan.

Obviously delusional, considering begining pandemic, global point view, things acellerating exactly contact tracing hit miss. trust person's honesty, parts story. people know they've been, really anything info. problem comparing real numbers ""excess mortality"" account actual mortality average without COVID-19.

No. doomerism. *How* reopen makes *all* difference world. Talking feat representing country whole, obviously speaking every individual person.

And yeah read history books watch history docs quite often, seen space race. It’s hobby mine. crime lie kill people lies. make crime evil enough say lies least dumb enough believe them? Yes, things know officially virus started anecdotally subs... True. live half hour Tokyo. lockdowns quarantines place all. Everyone still working usual, businesses didn’t even change schedules.

The thing obvious pandemic place masks. Everyone wore them. stigma wearing shame Japanese. shame big factor making sure public followed rules. Yes, totally weird ninth populous city China, city considered political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural educational center Central China, research lab... Yeah require mask made lockdown measures. Nam kicking ass Maybe smart bigger factor forcing everyone use masks. Nordic countries general applied restrictions proven effective scientific method. Face masks fall category. 3M [R95 mask, think outside Amazon. buy R95 get protection looks like cool shit Bane mask.

NZ: looks around nervously less pee see, fewer angry women house: Study - House. sane adult who’s sneezed coughed least life would know face covering would minimise spread droplets. emphasis *sane*. police officers shut businesses arrest people. like jay walking, crime mostly used arrest fine black brown people (FACT, ban this, disproportionally affects POC, fair, like won’t be). choose a), still get hated, people still die result beliefs.

Ethics fun game way. South Australia yet see mask outside doctor's office. also working office continuously, never going part time home. state crossed 60 days since last recorded community transmission lot Indians social media, lot mindlessly follow PM like lot Americans mindlessly follow President. Also, India's PM notorious scapegoating Muslims, distractions much way US President leads American press around nose. 

From see, Indians unhappy pandemic, blame China Muslims, unhappy Americans blame China protesters. Missinformation kills Thanks link, can't help think make sense. That's contact tracing thought country contact tracing. people gotten somewhere else, spontaneously appear among people got home lockdown wearing masks + socially distancing go grocery store, let's say. 

In contact tracing studies everywhere else world, yes, home already recognized number one place people contract coronavirus... get funeral, office, public transport, church, etc.

For instance, trace South Korea details outbreak began office course many people office infected families. act forced office strangers causes initial spread infection thing stopped cases listed article, say new - around 68% infections happen home, people close quarter situations strangers infected co-workers beforehand.

Jesus, follow everyone parties see they'd been? none went church? None work office opened have? 

Part issue U.S. contact tracing level self reporting required fact questions stop far short in, say, Wuhan, literally get health histories everyone know interact with, jobs, number people households, etc.

I'm resigned fact worst possible type pandemic country like U.S. ""ways"" matter much evidence certain things accumulates elsewhere, we'll stick collective heads sand ""our way"".

Ha... wow. America. Turkmenistan highly secretive dictatorship. expect public statistics publicly. Consider mask contaminated sanitized, especially outer surface. office, doff mask lay face-up, store paper bag.

Masks may sanitized leaving sunlight minutes according recent study (a prior study said sunlight didn't;t enough UV-C rays, later study contradicted findings). UV-C lamps also safely sanitize mask. telling us functional government works? 
P.S fuck Trump cult. bad literally can't establish causation unless there's randomization treatments. news, grass green surprising. dealing pandemic months now. initial response already great, we're making worse. Ah yes credible theory started US China says so. need doctor order tests? shit article, lockdown used China always proportional. reason Wuhan total lockdown rest China varying degrees movement restriction (eg closed management) initial outbreak.

In recent outbreaks Heilongjiang Shulan example neither cities lockdown like Wuhan either. Rather cases low/medium/high risk classification used fine grained control movement restriction district level. Hell even time confirmed case found Wuhan's population tested, Wuhan one district going medium risk, rest city remaining low risk movement restriction. Beijing outbreak followed strategy.

The reason fine grained lockdown proportional response exhaust resource nation (both physical mental), Bruce Aylward went report back March one bothered read it. nefarious know misinformation kill people know one true information. news, water wet Unfortunately double edged sword. data reveal lot, also manipulated ways always obvious easy detect push certain narratives. even sometimes data suggest conclusions layman interpretation always accurate generate less fear necessary (this particular shows color coding). Hence importance coupling expert interpretation data well. Swede here. CDC still recommend masks, even nurses elderly home staff caretakers. honestly count many people I've seen wear mask past Covid months two hands. Maybe 9 people. 

We 4 times many deaths Nordic Countries Combined. 5th highest per capita deaths world - that's despite country extremely low population density unlike belgium, spain, italy etc people live multigenerational homes (which non-existent Sweden)  I'm stupid, I'll admit it. also pretty stupid.

Many post mortem covid-19 suspected individuals discounted data. fair, one every four positive cases worldwide United States. El Salvador 70+ day strict quarantine really tight measures. However, last two weeks really hard, heavy rains floodings, undid effort put place. we're relaxing, we're seeing lots new infections. :( Exactly. stuff low deathrates pre-existing conditions asymptomatic carriers right wing propoganda. catch die. going fast I'm going count three.... numbers change, grounded!

One!

Two!........

Two half!......

Two three quarters........

I'm warning you! Correlation causation. Furthermore, fact numerous countries (Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Norway etc) got virus quickly control without use masks prove masks pretty much irrelevant. measures matter though.  “....Not ego Sweden” I’m sure:

Back march April Swedish authorities basically ridiculing Nordic countries handled virus, calling “unscientific”, “populist”, “panicked” etc. We’ve told Sweden better statistics, better trusting authorities, better listening experts instead politician etc

And government ministers blaming neighbors trouble borders, accusing discrimination, acting ridiculously creating deep wounds take long heal. 

This behavior unusual seen anything faintly similar Danish Norwegian authorities governments directed Sweden. 

The opinion one newspaper editor: “Swedish arrogance behind failed corona accept tourists countries. sacrifices nothing. True.... Oh miss central market (former Houston resident) Japan almost lost yeah good idea Americans support undocumented worker till Anny extent one word legal immigrants boom... one really cares Yes, covid 19 attacks ACE-2. critical component blood pressure vasoconstriction, well clotting factor. also critical regulating oxidative stress.

It's turning covid 19 less disease lungs disease endothelium. lungs gets good hold, endothelium actually causes harm. think Brazil. can’t hear bunker. save life?? saves PEOPLES lives?? 

I thought 'Murica!!! Still can’t get N95 masks citizens. Trump botched jaw-dropping fashion. It’s criminal. Surely says little masks? surprising countries quicker responses (whatever form took) pandemic better. Totally agree, aren’t going outrun tiger wild. best bet make big, face slowly back away making noises hope don’t want fight and/or aren’t hungry.

You may small chance survival things, chance survival zero turn back try run. due respect, future indigenous people globe have? get wrong, utmost respect indigenous cultures ability survived day, here's concern (for worth)

The consequences pandemic absolutely horrific but, opinion, ""leaving people cultures alone"".

When think it, monitoring indigenous people human-on-human version going zoo watch animals.. I'm entirely sure think Murica!!!!! went Defqon 1 6 times since 2014. great festival!! Oooh, get mine? Lmao, incivility??? think people prong public health guidelines anything complete morons? brilliant hahaha good example local efforts working harder breath N95? Like compared masks? Latin agricultural workers often live extremely close proximity. often seasonal, poor &amp; sending money living situations often quite opposite you’d want pandemic. We’re talking 100 bucks week rent bed 11 people room. aren’t given PPE, enforced protections job &amp; less likely interact public health systems. It’s situation county. It’s shown it’s present since November France October Italy.

NO FAKE NEWS!!! FAKE NEWS!!! FAKE NEWS!!!

//Kischa74 Sweden moron, mean less informed, mean ""masks work"" right. someone uses lots fancy speech sure look smart me.  Iceland. stop hoarders / profiteers who'd buy many possibly could hope making quick buck later on, situation happened hand sanitiser. US much much testing though right they’ll obviously find cases 

/s Switzerland. Never wear one obligatory either. Private use is. work, depending (doctor, nurse I.e.) mandatory though. usually smoke bbq sipping Corona. Disclaimer: layman; opinion based interviews epidemiologists.

Well, know medical science formally defines it, watched bunch interviews epidemiologists refer infection event virus entering system person, visible symptoms. ones virus entered system developed symptoms referred asymptomatic, counted infected factored IFR. IFR statistical estimate counted number, unlike CFR counted number. CFR varies widely depending healthcare system various aspects parts indicator disease itself, disease healthcare system.

Individuals ""susceptible"" enter either calculation, seems. Either infected not.

There point minimum feasible viral load, seem figured yet (i.e. 1,234 viruses one place), decide one number everyone.

There another omission earlier post, herd immunity confers good deal protection everyone infected, herd immunity (R0 - 1)/R0 % given population, means globalised world would be, assuming R0=3, 67% 7 billion 4.33 billion people. practice, might much lower. R reduces drastically take steps like masks (big one), staying home(big one), social distancing, temporary lockdowns, etc. Therefore, say R 1.5, would get herd immunity 33% infected (presymptomatic, asymptomatic symptomatic).

The point making IFR may &lt;= 0.5% potentially everyone vulnerable getting infected distance, means small percentage big number still pretty big number therefore everyone taking seriously.

----

Now, post, would like add virus obviously seems affect rich, poor powerful equally therefore, human power structures begun respect it, unlike case cold flu. Nobody shuts schools flu tuberculosis malaria, even though poor people die 100s 1000s annually it, poor matter. Yes, completely direct, car glass blocks UV.... mask fabrics block UV light... corona direct sunlight live... think like hiding shadows dense forest middle bright sunny day. 

Sunlight works mail like virus sucked depths fabric/paper.   Due initial high rate deaths, longer indicate current situation. Also estimate new daily number cases UK around 3,600 moment, almost 1/10 USAs confirmed number.

Cumulative data doesn’t show current trends level risk. Hehehe fucking Canadians. mean make feel inferior. blatantly misunderstand person trying say? Finland never required masks look us, still got lot deaths (yet) Italy well Neither Australia. It’s system wide response, decent health care. expect they're still first one Using Sweden bad example. Look Norway, Denmark Finland instead. took even seriously, mask demands great. Australia never required masks 100 deaths. It’s wearing masks. Lol go mall past weekend LA. wish hadn't. lot half full, inside mall busy ever. 70% people wearing masks. 20% masks, wearing properly (some eating, drinking, others noses hanging out, bunch hanging one ear), 10% masks all. Mostly high school kids, hanging groups 5-8, none masks, social distancing, etc.. Individual stores enforcing distancing masks inside stores, outside area free-for-all one respecting distancing marks floor. Equally bad, one enforcing masks distancing within mall. Employees cell phone fixit stands juice bars pulling masks talk other.

When got home, told wife California screwed. thought responsible, turns really huge number people give shit. Without massive shift strict enforcement, we're going slow down, see happening given current climate around policing.

Covid going major concern years rate. I'm scared matter time people start intentionally infecting go back work get better. south can't. I've lived life. bueno. Topped TP eggs low already even Ray Charles could see coming around corner. ...I'll never able stop thinking comment, great. Good news?  blame people playing game put front them. Moral fulfillment less important simple need eat shelter. goes humanity. Pushed bad situation, anyone become monster. larger framework society accommodate prevent situations people forced act immorally save themselves. society failed so. roast, really anything. think trying make connection non-american supporting immigration, thats hilariously stupid point make. Masterpieces cannot distinguished natural viruses come cheap.  place cesspool. went morning get smoothie noped fuck outta there. possible antibody surveys miss people whose non-specific immune response could handle virus? forget, eyes also transmission vector. Today highest number new cases yet. 1274 total tests that's 49 percent positivity rate day -- highest records. 7 day trailing positivity rate 35 percent. reality positivity rate higher addition including tests used diagnose covid figure includes follow testing. Yup, largest increases happened recently I’m here! person?! think people missing extremely important thing said article! nurse, article fascinating explains EVERYTHING happening age groups. Though people may dying ARDS, really dying new onset blood-clotting disorder!!!! Jesus Christ makes much sense!!! People developing renal failure. People developing heart disease. People strokes. People none conditions contracted coronavirus develop coronavirus potentially die diseases. people understand saying, blood-clotting disorder affects EVERY PART BODY!

God damn people wear mask stay home!!!! soooooo much worse realize!!!!!! Leave Canadian ooze thread unbidden backhanded ""polite"" well-wishes. fuckers worse Japanese much easier read.



And vote November, chuckles. November. Please stop spamming subreddit. Thanks PSA, Amigo! one people here. work also one annoying people work nobody wanted listen to.

...We've got around 1000 employees, maybe 200 300 confirmed cases found 1 employees early 20's confirmed death due virus complications.  Also, nobody’s gonna want go vote November COVID still around, might even worse now, second wave hits we’re still middle first one. We’ll forced either risk infection line voting booths, stay home. course, it’s risk I’m willing take election. hope others feel way. 

And wouldn’t put much faith mail-in/absentee ballots, since may even postal service come November. fear rural Wisconsin generally educated like orange dude high castle. ignorance cause state spike later summer. Stop making wearing masks politicaI!! Sooooo USA citizens travel fall yet? parents went Florida family reunion/graduation/spreading ashes (for someone died pandemic) Missouri last weekend. Drove back. always thought parents somewhat intelligent, they're stupid everybody else. mean, that's scumsucking governor Florida totally working /s places like Thailand almost cases then?  ready pissed school see anything school calling BLM march. I'm pissed OP dishonest title. Completely agree, IFR somewhere .4 1.0 % based estimates.

The reporting issue quite bad tbh. One needs go directly UM's site get facts: order ""open"", country must less 20 infected people per year. 100,000 inhabitants per week.

Sweden pass threshold, thus border remain closed overall. However, special clause: special mechanism established Nordic countries. Nordic country meet objective criteria ""opening"", country switch regional scheme. case, opened entry regions country meet criterion number infected persons per year. week. Similarly, Ministry Foreign Affairs travel guides yellow orange open quarantine-affected regions still requirement 6-day accommodations tourists Denmark, unless resident Schleswig-Holstein Skåne, Halland Blekinge. one regions quarantined, still possible enter negative tests shown least 72 hours entry.

Only one region [Sweden, Vastabotten, currently meets criteria let's face people typically go Denmark vice . According currently available figures, Skåne, Halland Blekinge areas considered 'quarantined'. Therefore residents areas (which given extra special treatment due historical relationship borderlands) *in theory* enter get test. Sweden's testing bad extremely difficult get unless symptomatic renders border closed despite provision. basicall ymens test = entry people can't get tested unless symptomatic so: entry. now, anyway, unless SE fixes testing infrastructure. number infected persons must low level, **as well work formulate criterion countries' test regimes.**

There news means yet. somewhat likely, opinion, happen higher threshold Sweden at. Although Sweden improving terms testing, near level Denmark at. would put past DK set level quite high, hopes encourage Sweden get testing act together. 

I think politics, Danish government trying make Sweden feel bit better giving consolation prize (that really much terms open borders reality) trying push right direction. We'll see sure June 27 case turns be. far Fredericksen played intelligently hope they're going use cudgel try get Sweden shape up, fling borders open borderlands [where recently infection pressure worse Denmark including think comprehension issues going beyond whether proper paragraphs used not, you’re missing point entirely.

Back issue, whether education important (it is), isn’t issue. What’s argued environment kids educated in, makes difference. Keeping child isolation indefinitely obviously harmful many ways, long term effects keeping child socially isolated would devastating. kids return school environment past ideal, many reasons. educational advantages also primarily social aspects, many would argue important experience child receive going school mid high school age range. issue discussed is: returning back school prematurely current environment potentially harmful worse continuing distance learning vaccine available. return environment they’re able interact teacher, let alone 4-5 classmates, denied meaningful social interaction, good it? They’re receiving education past, that’s longer possible, they’re interacting socially learning valuable life experiences, that’s longer possible, they’re participating things like band physical education many electives many kids find salvation in, that’s gone. going back worth it? happens child bring virus home? education worth life family member distance learning still viable? Currently, I’ve said before, son interacts 30 classmates daily. Going back school loses contact 25 them. He’s still educated home, he’s still learning “scientific thinking”, he’s also still exposed social interactions option interact personally friends closest him. one gets sick, one dies. Isn’t better forcing “new normal” one experience with, one knows effects of. I’d rather run science experiment mental well-being child simultaneously risking life. That’s what’s discussed here.
As far rest it, understand you’re teacher, many great teachers. there’s also many Michelle Pfiefer complex, great think mind. health class completely irrelevant, good say is, it’s norm doesn’t even apply here. statistics minor, also irrelevant, irrelevant next thing useless is.

Oh wait never mind known. uprise younger population getting infected, previous beliefs people elderly population affected slowly getting destroyed days goes by. schools make wearing masks mandatory, practice social distancing, practice proper hygiene, increase school sanitation practices schools reopen fall. 

Another threat right would families masks may send children school without one. Karen parents dont see threat end putting children danger. celebrating fact dead virus worst shit I've read eh. Lol. That's called failed federal system. Im beginning think mask use thing part weird culture war. mean, definitely think masks may help spread disease, think whole thread load confirmation bias. Proven study also glaringly obvious 2 seconds thought. 

Ever wondered cooled recirculated air meat processing plants might connection mass outbreaks Australia either. fact advice suggests nothing.
I think point Counties acted early, avoided serious issues Judging people sub dog piles anyone rolls windows driving desert, think maybe people know that.


Or pretend spread misery 5g nuts too... r/woosh believe title research paper ""DUH!!!"" Hmm, maybe building dam keeps water flowing. know, I'm p l c n Well, Texas... *corrupt region remotely haha. like food. 

Plenty foreigners probably acquainted latter haha. Can’t say tho. That’s funny tho. pho places I’m fun making sound like English profanity. Pho king, example “The sooner put coat on, sooner body warmed up.”

Hmm. Science. Maybe useful all. thumbnail Florian Kohfeldt Werder Bremen? like elevator Australia Yea, probably tons factors, Estonia basically little mask wearing public virus basically gone. like 0-3 positive tests per day everything back open weeks now, like even nightclubs yet spike without social distancing. Hell yeah, also love police beat people. guess there’s sky bison Way much chlorine gene pool!! Start lower price faster? decent bother wear one all, less decent properly. get around regs STILL wearing right, subjectively shitty human being. Your're correct, response cut corners there. one going make claim people wear masks based study, many people authors conclusion seem doing, imply causal interpretation results. Which, say, possible based cross-sectional study like this. 

And saying difficult prove causal effect mean accept paper, nothing else do. example, paper lot better ruling alternative causal pathways. number control variables extremely limited, meaning ommitted variable bias highly likely. likely things correlate facemask traditions COVID transmissions. leave out, high P, that's meaningless. get around this. probably variation time facemask-policy, allow get around fixed-effects framework (though high cost dropping countries without variation facemask use, probably East Asia). would likely remove extremely large coefficients income support debt relief well. 

Even then, obviously proved causal link. ruling alternatives made likely, solid policy recommendations. end day, compare countries across policy spectrum, can't base policy it? think that's terribly interesting. kind bullshit subreddit ist this. 99% ""hot"" topics US. like country exists here. Thats true. mean indigenous people weaker immune system makes vulnerable disease rest population.

That said, Brazil's strategy even herd immunity. Basically, challenged virus show strong really is. Sweden least things make sure healthcare system collapse.

The good news indigenous people Brazil Amazonas state, live, seems declining deaths cases. However, states like SP RJ, live increasing cases deaths explains plateau Brazil. Thanks, seems deleted something important trying create non-AMP link. 

Here's another easily get free drinks Casino. shelters evacuees always end states. No, appear actually understand 2 week lag is, otherwise making nonsensical claims.

If basic ability read chart properly, would obvious American cases declining almost exactly 2 weeks ago, started rising again. equally obvious deaths declining today.

I think stop pretending numbers show something don't. Anybody ever read Lawerence Wright book, End October? Oh right lol Imagine wikipedia page lol really, young okay. going give people severe disease problems. usually good smart people suffer dumbs a..holes. ignore tragedy caused this? good news there's earthquake people get survive it? Woohoo! people die died happened! 

You celebrate tragedy. I'm going sad avoidable suffering. mention 120k+ deaths.  dispute argument, mentioned pretty rich coming hypocrite. called PRAY AWAY.

Has working well far! ""If stop testing, number cases go way, way almost 0"" 

-Trump Thank you! always others vouching. Thank spreading word, I’m childfree even fond kids general sense, believe me, witnessed act laying someone floor this, I’d stick around vouch totally reasonable response. sound like pursed-lip breathing, great breathing exercise people COPD asthma. diseases, lungs stay hyper inflated encourages patient lengthen expiratory time encourage gas exchange. Death rate indicator real infection rate. Positive test rate not.

30k positive tests today mean maybe 100k actual infections, April 30k positive results meant 600k infections. true markets. Class C going struggle non-payment cares act done good make sure ""most"" people making amount unemployed employed.  


Class lease ups might drop rents order get occupancy acceptable level. building managed someone competent they'll likely give away two months free rent something concession.

Sending love South Florida 💚💜💙 know, overwhelmed hospital systems dying people amazing symptoms -- real symptoms -- develop scared shit something obsess it.

Problem California can’t deficit spend

Is something could change? interests rates are, world is, there's probably better time borrow like crazy. Florida. least many losing licenses. standard what's considered serious rise case interestingly different parts world. fellow Christian gotta agree, song ridiculously awful message. discussions I've seen informative times.

It's worth coming that. good news, also don’t entirely trust numbers die. Shows much care it. Thanks! already France December. retested samples pneumonia patients found people positive. people either travelled Wuhan relatives Deniale terrible thing😷 good antibody surveys done Spain, France, Italy consistently show IFR (infection fatality rate) 0.5-1.3% range.

You see IFR stat often controlled/known populations- example early on, cruise ship ([Diamond Princess, 712 known cases, 14 IFR worked right range. look numbers prison outbreaks ([e.g. known cases US prisons=46,249, IFR range keeps coming up.

Taking account, strongly believe reading article mean missed 80x number reported cases, wrong. There's much evidence fair understanding IFR.

[This lot good information supporting point I'm trying make. order cover Tump, rich keep making loads cash. right wing media pushed hard convince people covid big deal. half country follow guidelines, small vocal portion group actively fighting attempt slow disease. understand swayed financial loss. federal government going help, pandemic unemployment dries month, can't deficit spend much. They're bad situation think federal government putting hand scales trying force states open monetarily. may throw old people virus block way.

Lt. Governor Dan Patrick Positive, presumed 😭

Today sneezed. Pretty sure Rona. mom agrees thinks also sneezed house.

On god, sub trash. one doomsday af there's good information. pass snow bank die. states really tangible 'borders'... citizen idea could feasibly accomplished. check Google Maps state US see many roads highways cross state lines. things like designated entry points. state would kind man-power block roads setup many checkpoints across entire state (at least big states anyway). even factor cost thing.

There rules effect states require people traveling self-quarantine... that's really enforceable realistically. concerns whether bans would hold court. Thank Goddddd I'm going college August really want die within 2 days Christ crutch dude, got stoned. happened data? What’s trend? Houston here. eye test says yep. How? Seriously. 

The states east Mississippi probably thousand roads cross state boarders each. 

Not mention freedom travel constitution. 

It would shitshow. willing take action slow it. states extremely high positive ratios? Arizona, Alabama, many US states high 20% positivity. 

Also, rising hospitalizations 12 states? Full ICU’s Montgomery? 80% capacity Phoenix, Houston, Santa Barbara County?

The full picture maybe *okay* zoom in, reveals many alarming things Good news we’re looking months cut bad it’ll grow back Almost 8 weeks it? June 22, 00:00 (UTC+9)

Nothing inconsistent Contact nearest senator it. It’d worth time. Taxes come unemployment. Florida far lowest unemployment tax businesses state. get less, cut payments weeks eligibility every state. also refuse unemployment cases unlike states accept legitimate claims.

I’m trying come terms January start teaching public school lol that's exactly worst hit country do.

People parse good bad news however like. said NY..  literally everywhere look, people given buried heads sand. wanna know much owe honestly really sick. laugh stupid. Hee haw! Miami peeps crossing Alligator Alley southwest Florida, includes, Naples, Fort Myers Cape Coral. reside Fort Myers area overall business usual, including increase Covid cases well. beginning January, friend Guangzhou (who’s ICU hospitalist) provided second apartment across hospital case needed *really* lock down.  Really know.
I feel bad awful news. I'm Brazilian seems there's hope ahead. Dark times. work two jobs Houston, bosses pretty much ignored city opened back based Governor's guidelines. Leaving decision individual cities clearly impact. got quarantine 10 days back March told go back work. option use vacation days owe company money days got let go. Sure does. 

I mean, politically. Certainly scientifically. Anything 1 exponential different doubling time. Vermont healthiest state, top 10 resident healthcare access, low health disparities. Pair tiny little Appalachian state really big cities (relative massive cities like Chicago, NYC, LA, Atlanta, etc), low population density, average resident's enthusiasm outdoors makings pandemic survival. Yes! people understood simple fact! friend wrong. Thailand braced huge hit nothing came. overflowing hospitals, urgent need ventilators, etc. 

People freely talk what’s going on. cases started happening people identifying locations quickly Facebook, Twitter, elsewhere someone made map pinpoint happening. 

There isn’t hidden epidemic there. lag cases deaths cases truly spiking. death spike certainly come. lot data Japan, South Korea, Taiwan showing universal mask use, trains/subways major source transmission. places much transit-oriented societies US they're better infection control.

This mostly people interacting much actually others' space extended periods time (a lot public health departments using 10-15 minutes exposure rule thumb counts ""contact"").

A bunch people sitting around air-conditioned space 8 hours talking great transmission environment. hallway true options.. Every time think 2020 can't get worse does. can't wait 2021 things hit rock bottom. personally know ten people participated BLM protests. Four diagnosed covid. Definitely can, I'm QLD Australia we've used similar tactic worked treat. We're slowly opening back analysing data determine much lift social distancing restrictions. still new cases today yeet Leading world recoveries! This! Yup, stay vigilant. I'm sick fear mongering non factual stuff. Ppl keep saying things true good anyones mental health. know need do. Stay safe! That's I'm at. I'm born raised CA lol. I'm planning studying abroad next year saying I'm Californian American. save ass little possible U.S. hate. Telling European I'm CA LOT different saying I'm Mississippi lol stupid be? Threaten Health people? Geez! Like flat earthers, walk edge cure problem! Every time go look around see les 5% people wearing masks. Also see virtually efforts distancing.

Option C, above, correct answer. think US since least December.

I think legit December. I'm going antibody tested weeks.

Edit: people section thing tested flu negative. toys pay themselves! Illinois governor made business (literally) provide tests people think he’s dictator nazi providing tests Lead exa.. quarter CAs population immune? getting immunity data edited comment replying. 

I think responded like bit asshole, really disagree saying. referring attack messenger (NYpost) rather message - essentially NYpost article businessinsider article. wording almost save verb. articles accurate. Saying workers *commanded to* link cases protests exactly correct. NYpost may ideal, neither thehill, RT, lot others... 

Contact tracers able link cases protests... certain media lack information whatever please... general public provided clarity. 

It's far limb go on. effect, contact tracers told link cases protests. Whatever miniscule number people mention protests without asked sufficient track COVID contacts via protests effectively - all. understandable why, principle, government avoid asking citizens attended protest, means practice contact tracing case lower priority avoiding incomplete data (or alienating respondents). priority debatable either way - maybe infection scale beyond contact tracing - think people actually analysis blind implications. generic question, ""have attended large outside gatherings May X June X"" respondents provide information. NYC, large outside events going on.

I think presumptive question would much effective exact reason stated. Plenty respondents know answer - combination social media - make obvious, may trust surveyors enough honest. (even though surveyors unlikely that) contrast, contact tracer can't take answer question immediately presume protest. People also forget Memorial day weekend. protests figured would spikes alone. can’t fucks sense humor? Reality dark enough! Cheers.

Honestly think knows areas places would still support him, hence hotspots first place. would never thought million billion years fighting pandemic would become partisan issue. Facts. one paying attention actual COVID19 hospitalizations. Summer ICUs always peak, especially around July 4th assume everyone dying let steam lockdown. Overall ICU concern lot places COVID19 related, point. Deaths stagnant well, solid month. Headlines say ""40% increase coronavirus hospitalizations 3 days"" tell 40% increase total 20 cases. I'm trying get ppl unsafe go party things actually getting better. spike cases mortality serious conditions rate outcomes dropping worldometer well. found article interesting also possibility increase hospitalizations.

FAQ

What mean?

The amount karma (points) comment Reddit account decreased one.

Why this?

There several reasons may deem comment unworthy positive neutral karma. include, limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm correctly flagged /s.

Am banned Reddit?

No - yet. refrain making comments like future. Otherwise forced issue additional downvote, may put commenting posting privileges jeopardy.

I believe comment deserved downvote. un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. exceedingly rare circumstances undo downvote. would like issue appeal, shoot private message explaining got wrong. tend respond Reddit PMs within several minutes. note, however, 99.9% downvote appeals rejected, likely exception.

How prevent happening future?

Accept downvote move on. learn mistake: behavior tolerated Reddit.com. continue issue downvotes improve conduct.

""The 1918 flu killed 675,000 Americans; **50-100 million people died worldwide.**

""That's equivalent 225 450 million people today,"" said John Barry, wrote history 1918 flu adjunct faculty Tulane University. ""The numbers staggering.

Second, study might big effect reported press release. report alpha spend premature closure. improvement survival significant ventilated patients, subgroup, whole study group. Even though prespecified, possible finding reproducible. replicable subgroup analysis people requiring oxygen (includes ventilated patients). group, effect modest, like 3% improved survival. Also, large percentage study patients tested negative COVID.

The literature surrounding steroids ARDS hot mess, makes harder trust data. China, Italy, countries gave steroids many patients, discern big effect. give perspective, survival benefit ventilated patients would big deal penicillin pneunonia, recognisable. convincing people look retrospective data sites see trend holds up.

Thanks intriguing response, lol. Congrats one way! I'm curious pregnancy (and child) affect girlfriend's ability earn ? confrontational, word could using would argue Jan-Feb 2-4 month window gone.

That may true, point. point really 80x undetected cases detected would seen evidence serology studies done April/May. Correct going stop testing too, right? Give states need since want roll back testing. good. said worse flu he’s ever lot, bad whopping cough.

Isn’t 50% less chance like saying they’re 1/2 times less likely get it? 

For example, factors increase risk 5 times wouldn’t 500% increased chance? 

If I’m understanding correctly, isn’t 50% small difference? Phoenix doctor here

I work two hospitals. One medium/large. One small. near capacity. holding people ER. docs talking many COVID patients are

new word learned whose concept understand even United Kingdom / Canada / Sweden / Singapore successfully significantly lowered transmissions, yet seeing uptick cases **United States**, developed country rampant infections... going wrong US?

* closed shops companies could hold 2m rule
* 
* encouraged working home
* 
* would help pay employees can't work
* 
* 2m distance minimum people
* 
* max 5 people gatherings (except houses/families 5)

The people allowed go time. People bit mainly stayed home will, following recommendations.

The Netherlands course densely populated impressive like cities overwhelmed Switzerland either. Maybe would something would get new shot ever year, like flu? So, don’t lie kids think growing world not

So times dad said, ""The world's fair, Deal it"" Trying pay daycare. shit's expensive! Imagine life long effects may never cure. imagine brain-dead people running around without masks, screaming ""only 1% death rate"".

This new thing today, *has already trending weeks*. 

Increase testing + increase looking asymptomatic carriers = increased cases increased deaths. Lets hope progress phenomia ventelator. people die covid haven‘t already died.

How claim this? Even number correct hundreds thousands people die. help prevent spread coronavirus, April 17, customers Walmart required wear masks shopping store, despite regulations individual state. 

Umm, what? actual thing they're still doing? say 100% certainty *never once* enforced Walmart closest me. least 80% shoppers wear masks, even peak-mask late April/early May, 50/50. nationwide shoulder-to-shoulder gatherings thousands people recent weeks... give that?! fixed first link, actually removed it. linked one account... No. getting serious pneumonia might. Influenza follows similar pattern; early cosmopolitan metros, late socially distant areas
And geometric growth slow, isn't. NY probably Jan latest. Well shit, happens bunch NFL players get fall?  Think would admit getting sick? 100 years science supporting notion masks help reduce transmission disease directions. But, things seem obvious people studied subject, obvious everyone. 

Most people studied particular subject. People studied subject, know, need told. everything gonna person protest keep spreading covid? Dad day protests end sight. like whole year vaccine.

At least small protest sounds it. Coronavirus like
They told everything bigger Texas coronavirus career ending top athletes? Somehow Chinese names translated Japanese/Korean way(?). one pointed ""Chengshousi"". Cool, hopefully 50 days hospital pay Dr Fauci lied everyone US.

How man still job...*oh right he’s establishment goon 40 years* 😒 Seem like remember Fauci saying virus last long textured surfaces like clothes. lasts longest surfaces like stainless steel countertops. isnt actually reflection reality though it... they've eased distancing, they're ending lockdown... ok great.. we'll enjoy second wave everyone even complacent already.... course could ask people strong economy one wants go Florida keep people interested military careers getting tested? that's seems like would do.

. Nice. time announced Yep experience informed key. really advertised west covid first hit HK, nearly entire population switched wearing masks almost overnight. government really direction fear angering China people left what's right. That's kinda like America except people better informed masks. 

Taiwan opinion deserves highest regard. kept cases low.

Probably, one costing 10x times made China. I'm imagining opposite, imagine President commission tried self medicate bleach... Narrator: “it did.” think sports star come reputation tarnished Novak. 

You want anyone get way acted multiple instances this, recklessly putting many peoples health risk reflect seriously badly person many people look to. reminds Andy office told truth. Melbourne second wave community transmission public who've lost focus. Masks would've helped keep focus stop second wave. Lying people efficacy importance masks going go one biggest blunders handling coronavirus. Think amount people got infected who’ve gotten infected kid. shut move on! Oh look, people starting spot question inconsistencies timeframe given. 1.5 months hmmm that's heavy. CDC wrong since day 1.

I wearing mask March patients asking why. told prevent asymptomatic spread it. understand CDC saying masks necessary unless symptomatic.

I also wearing N95 COVID positive patients said... Oh wait... stupid. always least little aerosilzed. Yeah, wear N95s COVID positive cases.

The amount incompetence organization staggering. know they'll ever recover professional circles. Correlation causation. always amazed people really understand phrase means apply it. case, likely countries lot cultural and/or institutional characteristics equally likely account discrepancy, also happen mean required masks earlier. AZ, 1 every 5 tests positive. That’s based even find location get test currently. Testing, result turnaround availability much trifecta problem AZ much virus. virus know it’s supposed spread outside private political rally? Spoiler: progress. go forest, trees see! family Florida, taking seriously.  she, sister, brother in-law it. don’t know someone look 400k+ death toll, say it’s big deal. looks like blatantly misunderstood I'm saying.

Thinking hard, know. try harder. OK Dr. Douche. Love comments. top level athlete recall hearing football (soccer) player Irelands top league hospitalised 2 weeks respirator.

Again top top level athlete still professional would fit 99.74%* make turn car around dammit! Tell Joe Rogans uneducated ass. People aren’t touching mail thinking they’re going die, yeah, article helpful. Sometime say meant sick next say everyone. Stop flopping.

Also, ain’t mask shortage still thing exactly kind inauthentic polarization astrofurfing crew around pushing. Nobody demanding rest history, dishonest interlocutors deliberately pushing line. they’re correct 100,000 stupid. get number from? There’s lot said healthy dose preppier mindset; forces dispassionate look assumptions need run life manner you’re accustomed, can’t help respond uncomfortable realities might discover. amount modern world runs assumption, unquantified risk, “this never happen us” mindset (well put btw) astonishing.

You stay safe dude. Unfortunately, share custody two oldest someone who, say take seriously, understatement. 
Everytime come back it's,
""Did know masks bad you?""
""There going microchip vaccine, wanna get it.""
""This even real, shutting things reason.""
And on.

Visitation biggest risk, guarantee catch Covid-19, household. Probably liberal states wear masks higher overall rate liberal states protests average. probably still detrimental effect (coronavirus wise) protests. good rebreathe carbon dioxide

Oh jesus. cry people understand science try reference science. Instead tone policing order cape racist war criminal claim abhor, could simply good ally. I’ve come around to. Originally gave people much credit they’d wear masks without mandate. Early least Houston case lot places went. 90% wore masks responsibly places like grocery stores etc, even without mandate. hope people largely right thing. reopened May, initial wave doom gloom crowd kept warning never came, spoiler: masks social distancing worked. Slowly people became less vigilant case count slightly increasing past month. people started clamoring restaurants couldn’t operate low capacity people wanted start going bars larger groups again. bit bit find now, mandate masks. literally knew shit January. see obvious ""don't hoard masks need em"" dumb shit. wife nurse fertility center. Totally elective non essential. 

Nurses started testing positive there. Management tells line. FUCK!?! 

They also telling patients/customers they've exposed. brainwashing. hasn’t “shown.” It’s hypothesized. uh, read? state like Texas, would see around 24 million cases best available guess IFR maybe 200,000 deaths state decline.

Thats conferred immunity proves long lasting.  far don’t evidence that’s case. Toss shit back lap let know feel ""isolation"" habits. was? spent weeks beginning denying big deal, saying cases soon would zero. reports repeatedly briefed early December completely blew off. cat bag listened experts. Even lasted weeks. Ngl hard interpret lol nervous laugh context. lot people going die. Protests nothing it. thing happened people recovered SARS. another benefit ""herd immunity"" need guard 100%? That's practically impossible anyway probably easier (and way cheaper) separate approaches 90% effectiveness each.

It's strange - people seem understand reduction reduction. Masks 100% either, neither btw vaccines.

The poster boys making perfect enemy good. Seems like thinks away supporters rally keep safe. indoors AC masks...that shit could cover lot area indoors. medicine Chyawanprash 2.0 I've told there's third party browser plug helps avoid arguing trolls flag past Reddit engagement.

And affirms it.

I verified. understand beat virus spreads droplets though post literally scientific evidence masks effective...? Yeah, correlation, also know masks help keep particulate matter out, multiple scientific reasons (and evidence) believe work. Something thought of. America culture individualism. me, baby! actually want people comply mask wearing, need advertise way protect 'me' people. Advertising way protect people, myself, going get American's whole start wearing masks. 

Look market guns, ammo, knives, survival supplies...that's protecting individual individuals family. Yeah total shock. organized for-profit party pandemic. Yeah mistake. fact based information.

Just india written makes low quality people. Australian study followed ill result three different infectious pathogens, found around 10% developed chronic fatigue syndrome.

 HIPAA good thing medical privacy important number reasons. workplace directly notified person could come contact, would effect knowing exactly without revealing identity. last week, officials Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina North Carolina reported uptick COVID-19 cases among people 20s 30s.

So **not** MN, PA, NY, NJ... biggest protests took place, people might like news... Again, repeatedly lied to, start even world leaders going ""it's flu"". 

When bottom line ""sell folks good time"" product people. Trusting protect lives literally part deal. Honestly even doctor ship then? 

Seeing writing wall, great you, something folks done, disagree that. blaming folks sold good time repeatedly lied point looks like front article could done told truth, well cant blame ""dumb karen"", blame ""snake oil sales man"" speak. know. scam. 😡 idea protect chin neck. think Indians entitlement? lmao. can, bigger issue never know taken everything account (put rather, almost know sure haven't).

Airborne, albeit temporary, still easier spread rate touch. chances much higher would breathing wrong air, touching wrong surfaces. Isn’t vitamin one get sunlight? thought played golf constantly?  believe one blamed most. remember encourage mask wearing general public first. Worse, actually *discouraged* fear depleting mask supplies medical facilities. took April reverse recommendation!



I remember people saying wearing masks selfish irrational depleting market ""WHO says effective."" shows badly handled live Japan, people *love* masks.



Seriously, can't believe badly handled whole issue... mean, believe fear depleted mask supplies medical workers justified one, especially western countries supply chain strong. understand *scientific evidence* mask wearing effective. mean *discouraging* mask wearing every country world right thing. message ""We *don't know* effective. Governments keep enough supplies medical workers increase supplies case proven effective."" Seriously.



The Asian countries named article succeeded (relatively speaking) people/government *ignored* saying went instinct/habit anyway. case. Wear face shield mask! It’s like portable, wearable plexiglas barrier times. absolutely unacceptable people whose jobs advise us health *lied* people health. 

The supply shortage separate issue forsaken duties. 

Even try mush two concepts together, Hospitals need toilet paper hand sanitizer never ran out. mechanisms federal government mandate factories retasked make things needed crisis (usually wartime). started process January/February data quickly spreading across China, *absolutely never* health officials tell people lies masks.

Regardless intent, irreparable harm done health professional’s credibility. I’ve talked people still believe masks aren’t effective preventing spread COVID, quote surgeon general argument. long fucking stupid antivaxxers convert folks way thinking conflating absolute 100% bullshit lies health pros fed us masks, “lies” vaccines? 

It best short-term gambit incredibly high medium long-term cost. also funny somehow thinks things like social distancing arent based science. think safe say they're related given present differently EVALI never shown contagious. I'm northern Texas. (Wisconsin) get dirty looks wearing mask. extra precautions wear eye goggles expect go somewhere could people coughing sneezing without wearing mask.

In addition, washing hands soap cleaning hand sanitizer touching face well taking shower including hair washing return home absolute must. end day, simply products environment know I'm probably arguing teenager still rebel fase thinking know everything better, parent comment right wrong

I can't honestly tell irony statement lost not. statement is... hilarious. 

Canada/Finland/Norway/Denmark require masks well. Saying something government response social distancing (which based SCIENCE knob) etc actually right. least far complex mask good mask bad. one item solution. Grow up. Yeah testing did, used common cold variation coronavirus one strangest things ever tried do. rightfully put end suggestion next day. even appoint him, gives shit

Strange character current leadership. Wanting less biased less Chian centric politicizing crisis. many, many athletes Olympics culmination career professional life. retire years. yes, care whether Olympics happening near future know popular opinion, but.

Study says bunch things impact it, pick circa 10 probable things, predict 55% variability (ie, half).... one 10 things masks - throwing sates choose - masks isnt strongest predictor..... less 10% countries considered early mask wearers compare thoae countries make comparison.....

And headline picks ""masks"" headline. Maybe , maybe, unbias media article? muh first amendment Looks good paper, kind ""I Legend"" started? summer already. summer break on.  poignantly demonstrated education social safety nets important. unprecedented amount research going fact 2 candidates already heading phase 3 trials 8 phase 2 trials, guess you’re right. 

Also even vaccines available general public world yet, could imagine would effort hold olympics immunizing athletes/coaches allowing attendees could provide proof natural antibodies/vaccination. much money involved olympics many people would see opportunity bring world back together can’t imagine won’t olympics vaccine development keeps going smoothly.

Similar there's Muslim majority country without share Islamists Congrats UK flattened curve. Europe weakened COVID-19. mean number infected that’s announced day? That’s true official numbers released people tested positive COVID-19. However uk person symptoms advice still isolate try get home. can’t get tested easily. official numbers estimates people infected. example peak, 8th April 8733 new confirmed infections estimate around 72 THOUSAND new infections day. estimate peak actually 26th March approximately 100 thousand new infected day. That’s vastly different numbers. despise way UK handling data it’s misleading genera public. See link useful joint hypermobility? Right?

So patch quilt approach pandemic successful country’s made implemented requirements province level country level.

I think know happened US. Props Governors put massive sh*t whole cluster


Speaking this, I’d remiss didn’t send big shout Governor Cooper North Carolina. quite posted sub - fact another one posted today commented knew since February.

Some sources you:

1. run searches sub, find studies research conducted several countries months back I’m sure one posted earlier today.  Hmm low, wonder country newspaper turn shit recently. country recently hold grudge reporter, even word ""Nhỏ không học, lớn lên làm nhà báo"" meaning ""lazy study youth, growup Reporter"". Maybe reason reporter country feel freedom (include freedom lied people find lied - act ike never happening except appear Facebook, thank good still facebook instead anti-communist/government reporter). That’s absolutely ridiculous, considering measures, mask wearing best scientific basis infection prevention. I’m excusing local idiots, govt put consistent message masks beginning- it’s given much cover stupidity masks. mylyoshi9 right. totes destroy society. Fuck social distancing. Fuck recession. Fuck job losses. God knows many creative ways he'll find fuck country happens. Weird mentions this. offensive comment. generally wear one mask whole day (8-10 hours outside) unless I'm engaging physical activity(once mask gets sweaty/wet reasonable degree useless). people speak to(here HK) way. nice balance otherwise going masks quickly. course differs based circumstances, like ER doctor example. want tell us talking *the world*? it? Nah, drinking end things quicker. Google friend. Ancient Chinese survival technique: fucking moron. waiting this. Nothing stopping me, half people around wearing them. Well obviously virus created humans, now, might ask proof

I prove cannot lie saying truth, 2+2 = 5, true, means cannot lie

Hence, ~~the moon landing faked~~ coroviriz fake

Also, called 19? Hvae 19!!!!! covids before

Goverment liys! TRUMP SECOND COMING GOD-UH Google them. There's plenty places who've reported it. lol States allowed take debt run deficits. California idiotic balanced budget amendment constitution sounds logical run emergency like can't get state crisis without letting people die. Cases spiking end June, 1.5 million cases end July, exceed 2.8 million. virus, kind want take mask cough people wear one me. gonna lie. Scream, “it’s God-given right wear mask communist!” They’d confused. anti-science, Dr. Fauci one point recommended masks. Masks new. fundamental issue science, slow, many scientists can't proper research, cant criticize science get lumped ignorant people.

There fundamental problem modern science sensational reporting; quality rigor studies went back tutoring job. Slowly phases implemented, slowly ventured out, mask always indoor places. dont go places crowded appears crowded avoid. Thank god local parks reopened, gives natural outdoor space move get fresh air. haven’t seen friends, that’s wearing unstructured time due this. naught.......fuck that’s gonna worse. sense trying keep hope virus going decimate us all.

Thanks reply Statisically significant means specifically measurable number instances instead random. 

It thinking. Thank compiling list. try keep things saved send family far care I'm trying convince going risky. everyone says can't wear mask. severe lung problems burnpits Afghanistan. 

 wear mask, two hours time to. always easy, take break middle, ""I can't breathe x,y,z, (for most)* bogus.

If lungs bad can't breathe mask, public. immune system diminished, lack PPE going help thing.

* Yes realize people cannot wear masks dude severe restrictive issues, nasal cannula fit N95 without much disruption seal. Ventilation seems play huge part spreading virus. apply every country seems like northern areas harder hit Winter southern countries harder hit summer makes sense peak indoor contact ventilation usage occurs.

Northern areas stay inside heat 24/7 Winter southern areas stay inside AC 24/7. strong suspicion New York hit much harder initially large population centres US partially Winter.

Of course explain places like Italy Brazil think definitely factor consider. 2020's version cutting palms shaking hands. racist. sure. Slowing down, time go long walks together, etc truly amazing. folks California believed science wore masks. [Dr. Fauci efficacy face OP means late March, number SUSPECTED cases (which counted) around 100,000 per day Ignoring virus playing virus. could seen coming. happening NY back March didn’t stop May. locked to.

/s need get brigaded today... Except new job offers, people affected EO travelled US temporarily vacation business, pending visa renewal return. it’s simple whether one wants go back, like willing quit job (perhaps partner’s too), sell car &amp; belongings, terminate lease, insurance etc - remote - Trump thinks part covid-19 problem. really see good news. seems like sprint get second wave country one absolute worse hit world. One thing note need careful regarding method chemicals use wash mask render mask significantly less useful, especially N95 masks. Heres one mentioning, Im sure why. US places like Australia media leaders/""experts"" discouraging mask use could preserve supply healthcare workers.

Yet general public wearing masks early on, article talks about, healthcare workers wouldve treating less patients. time progressed wouldve risk less amount cases would actually decline.

Yet still see people defending decision lie effective masks, claiming valid reason. never valid reason. shortage masks, people make home, shouldve national effort produce them. Stay home people. Time get coronavirus, now. Yes, California cases skyrocketing. live Southern California. many people wearing mask public, one exposing nose hanging around chin show one. ridiculous. People living like pandemic. husband put gas car day went mask course. lady register told him, "" need wear mask it."" I'm concerned sending kids school coming school year... doors open. mask obsession comes realizing it’s election year, local, state, federal politicians re-election never going shut again, matter bad virus gets. Since people willfully ignorant disease continue go things open, last public health tactic left encourage people wear masks. Stay hydrated well-rested keep immune system healthy, evidence vitamin supplements may either reduce risk infection reduce severity disease both, normally skeptical vitamin studies RCT dozen studies showing strong correlations Vitamin role immune system, probably good idea take recommended daily dose (higher dark skinned people) since people getting less sunlight self isolation anyways. Good luck take care. Sweden, sat back, laughing like drain: ""America supreme power"". thing American ideals push individualism. ""special"" ""unique"", although true, become quite toxic everyone running around huge ego. Knights Pub college bar known giant cesspool. surprised this.

No, really know back then. revisionism pretend did. OP means late March early April. Back then, testing levels strategy like Brazil rn. However, April May government campaigned higher testing got levels today.

US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams wife absolutely personal contact anyone except mother, home. mother home months.

If stupid people want stupid prizes? They're easy get. They're also easy avoid. Totally normal, like corona viruses caught 3-6 months. go chasing tabloid headlines. really see issue snippet above, hopelessly beyond rational discourse. Yet general public wearing masks, healthcare workers wouldve treating fewer patients. sense public wearing masks wouldve protecting healthcare workers even more. Like said, masks work.

We want wear take deaths result.
We daily deathtoll 0 5 seems ok that, ok deaths diseases preventable. Like flu. agree everything you’re saying, one minor nitpick, Houston hospitals aren’t capacity. They’re currently running 85% normal ICU capacity half surge capacity. 1/3 beds filled Covid patients too. That’s still bad, still time right ship. Hopefully mask mandate helps that. surprised. Yes agree personally always irritated me. Never fan way would carry court sometimes. But, even putting personal thing completely aside, absolute shambles since tennis stopped.

Talking taking COVID vaccine developed, discussing instagram dirty unsafe water cleaned power mind, refusing join zoom call 400 tennis players needed talk head essentially players union. anyway terrible whole sorry saga tournament organised. Woah man, good look. buddy! would mean Trump can't hold rally there? ;) mention shouldve government large corporations find way provide masks shortage, instead lying situation order try preserve supply had.

As mentioned earlier comment, general public wearing masks healthcare workers wouldve treat less patients. Therefore public wearing masks wouldve actually protected healthcare workers ones access them. Im sure isnt pointed more. 10 million people Sweden lives outside 3 biggest cities

There lot better ways say lmao, thought saying Sweden really fucking urbanised minute, meant 80% live outside big 3 cities, 0.00008% surprising. wonder many people spread well? think showing spread virus heavily linked indoor contact ventilation systems. course bad policy plays large role well indoor interaction either AC Heat seems play large role spreading virus.

More northern areas seem harder hit winter southern areas seem harder hit summer makes sense comes peak indoor interaction ventilation usage is. course true every country seem like pretty solid trend. Cameron van der Burgh, Olympic gold medalist swimming serious issues correct. whole 2 weeks thing meme. takes well month see significant spikes, hell, look Florida, opened beginning may, spike started week ago, 1.5 months reopening. Social distancing, stay home orders, better testing, better contact tracing...

Is anyone doubting country orders masks early might also better things well?

I'd also love read quote article/study accounts things - must missed it. familiar US voting system eh? They're gonna go back that. US Army recorded 800 additional positive cases yesterday. I'm pro mask even pro ""don't use masks excuse break social distancing"" - give fake numbers that's apparently exactly sort thing found researching effect society-wide level 1918 pandemic. People masked little nothing else flu ran rampant still. recommendation wear one public health crises went away shortly pandemic due lack measurable proof effectiveness, 100 years since never data show reason go back that. 

To me, says lot whatever reports mask4all campaign drudged try prove effectiveness public health level past 6 months. would surprised found hard way months major health organizations downplayed masks favor pushing social distancing indeed 100% correct so. good. Hope continues go well there. That's No-Vax Djokovic y'all. This.  Lung damage also means risk get seasonal flu, pneumonia, next pandemic. lot easier go denial rather research assertions, it? States granted great power act slow spread disease. states already policies place months now. Arizona still makes visitors CT quarantine, even though tables completely turned. government control comes in.

Masks Taiwan made cost \~10c piece, government buys fixed price \~15c each. 15c also price government sells public (since government allowed make money this).

It might *priced* 10x government step in, terms production cost different, government adjust much they'd allow producers make, much subsidize public.

Even 1.5USD each, it'll cost 45 dollars month. really *that* much money grand scheme things. Sometimes buy curbside take reheat home. 

It get hot, it’s fun wait, feel pretty safe eating food. doubt virus withstand heat subject to. many dead people pub worth? Seriously. Come number. one favorites.

Lost respect this. think police going spend significant amount resources time enforcing social distancing?

Considering job protect public, yes. 

But nah, better use time killing people instead. 2nd third person spread. general public wearing masks, doctors nurses wouldve likely treating far fewer patients first place. Im sure isnt talked about. mean stomach ulcers account drinking many coronas stress? Yeah new year new me.... saw article saying China could’ve cases back August 2019. *""Some cells memorize cope virus first infected muster effective protection second round infection,"" said. Scientists still investigating whether mechanism works new coronavirus.

“The finding paper doesn’t mean sky falling,” said, also noting number patients studied small.*

Isn't normal antiviral antibody levels fall said virus cleared? WOuld interesting make list studies they've done showing mask use effective, including articles widespread mask use reduced covid infections countries mask use widely adopted. That's proof right work.

I keep seeing people post subs 1 random study said masks ineffective, maybe said they're 3% effective? course study fox news dug ran with, one talking points ""open up"" people using. Thats statistical fact like stat low testing per population stat. inappropriate one cos india testing second cos big populous country can't test everyone Americans know better cause know good healthcare looks like ignorant. Kind sad really. protests racism, police brutality institutional racism. Nobody cares random florida man racist nobody actually thinks stop racism, care hospital bank police force racist. idea protests racism police promulgated various state-controlled media sources, cbc, order defang protest prevent real change.

Russia 146M. Europe total 748M.

But US lower numbers reported deaths. numbers countries well comparable. important trend. surprised people thought highly begin with. always whiny seemed like jerk. first impression watching take many breaks could hot claim needed medical attention could sit shade every minutes. sure. Whilst much much smaller scale, NRL (rugby league) Aus gone really well id suggest thats sport started back like NFL regarding contact. lot people dead Yeah they've known one spreading Europe US different media talking enough.

Selfish individualist culture isn’t “white” it’s subset western culture. Many western “white” nations communal good job containing COVID. Also hotels nice checkpoint. coming stay 4 days? Why? Fly in, quarantine hotel fly out? OK except Imperial County transfer counties crowd in. getting voted right, vaccine may 6-12 months away, many said wont use well vetted likely means 2,3 even 5 years. What? Thats clear reason, Memorial day protest rise coming from. event see rise anywhere 2 5 weeks out. I'm happy see county bent curve. start, one highest cases county US. countless bars restaurants across Florida, country matter, Covid outbreaks.

This one especially egregious. No. Campaign gets money donations, taxes. Sweden

What Norway Sweden? need disprove disprove OP, all. Norway open borders Sweden, "" Swedish regions low infection rate."" FACT! 

Ah, agree OP's article factually lie. Thank much. Absolutely. Office work PC/laptop go coronavirus around. masks stupid pointless, east Asia using decades. whole culture built around now! america shows party wants act like experts smh quite brand honestly. track hospitalizations. fact disease spreading given. Good Luck US people. quarantine don’t wan’t let half population die recover nasty effects like loss 20-30 % lung function :/ Damn, forgot Karen's mozzarella sticks! actually incredibly simple, absolutely mind-boggling one party's solution pretend exist.

I forgot sub on. always atleast one shitting america comment. Masks required barely see Netherlands. Yesterday government reported 0 deaths Yeah congress sitting next stimulus bill anything help Masks major part preventing spread virus. Masks contact tracing go hand hand. Govt traces quarantines people. citizens wear masks prevent spread virus. way virus eradicated. Masks important. never 50,000 cases Arizona week many tests 😂😭 Stop bullshitting people. Fucks liver Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position charging hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving argument. Whataboutism particularly associated Soviet Russian propaganda. Wikipedia

Logic: Logical fallacy

Tactic: Propaganda technique

Active period: Cold War–present slow tests, slow pandemic! Genius!! Sweden barely see anyone wear mask. strange since government recommending using either. Lol, virus deadly, death rate much lower 5%. Considering possibly 1 10 people catch get tested going current death toll, death rate likely closer 0.5%

Still large number, get wrong, 50% read article. There's lot fuzzy math concerned significant proportion could left lung scarring

They're talking 30% HOSPITALIZED cases.

.. we're thinking what, maybe 3% total infections? Less?

We know widespread thing is. know many people asymptomatic.

Is shitty people? Yeah. know that. slightly altering definition shitty? Okay.

This massive new impact overshadows existing situation, minor knock-on effect already massive global issue.

My point is, massively overhyped Reddit thread recently. Even Covid it’s still safe time alive, yes, whole ordeal extremely traumatizing. 

Not kids, adults like too. significant event us ever lived through, terrifying. add data provided above:

* 7 day trend new daily hospitalizations hit new time high 8th day row. [See chart spreadsheet [with data record tying number Covid patients [were seen (it hit records 9 last 10 days).

* Last five Monday’s new cases starting today:

Basically us dont opportunity parents every years something ruins job/economic market us. Avik Roy's new wingnut grifter thinktank credible source Hahahahaha antifa xD

Hahahaha..

Wtf that???

Keep garden clean dplrbl tough measures means shouting virus. could happened? getting 2nd stimulus aid check USA soon? would probably help.. Yeahhhhhhh. Gotta love autocorrect. hard enforce 3 potential ways it.

1. pointed licence plates, many toll booths throughout NY, somebody drives another state triggers multiple booths throughout short period days, quarantining.

2. fly stay hotel, allow hotel reopen monitor guests idea bars reopening, hotels following quarantine rules lose licence period time.

3. Community policing. hearing quite lot community policing could perfect time start. Hard big city Hamptons shore homes surrounded locals could report anybody new area following quarantine. Blown away, mask prevented air getting you. believe vaccines produced prior trial data coming in, doses distributed *if* trial data good. Good, good, enforce late. Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** 7-day avg continues climb. Today cases ever added single report. track go 50K 60K 3 days!
- **Testing:** PCR testing shot 6,000 tests. (Good!) Likely catching weekend reporting lag.
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage went 10.3% 10.5% (based 440K tests, 6.6% low) average week 22% (but based 627 cases).
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations skyrocketed 7% (all time high). ICU beds COVID patients 5% (all time high). Ventilators use COVID went 2% (all time high). 

*Data Source: This. remember Iceland said 1/3 people asymptomatic. asymptomatic TIME TEST. Chewables shall remember Danish health safety restrictions include rather firing employees treating them. guess sick leave thing Denmark. government could replace TTI ""Have tried getting sick?"". shit? Cases go up, managing growth contact tracing. Ideally keep numbers low enough get vaccine that's probably going happen. Sweden mitigated virus' spread much mitigate spread news impacts image. Attention 'we gonna get anyway' folks....

I like rounding up. 3.45 basically 3.5. case, one tiny exception really negate FACT *only one tiny exception*. that’s awesome!! go toward! Good job 👏🏻 I’m conflicted I’m sure lot would like work unemployment difficult get, time seems like logistical nightmare get things back order. hope something limit capacity eventually open. Maybe keep lot indoor attractions closed? Idk. NC weeks ago one people wearing masks stopped gas. live Miami required public places, even outdoors. Well won’t cheap anymore Thanks. Sweden last tobacco cigarette Mid March. Keep good work US!! That's still triple number new cases seeing 2 weeks ago. least bags HIPPA compliant, get busted emailing personal information Including Greenland Denmark would stupid, would comparing Sweden Denmark 80% Swedish pop. lives 20% area wow, that’s sad 😞 I've seen people handidly saying sub. 

What exactly ""Kick mean""? 

It would huge scandal state could kick another states citizens out.  Thats unconstitutional even island. Consistent studies Wuhan. Avoid indoor family events parties want stay healthy. Hong Kong university study showed almost 80% outbreaks due events.

You're god damn fool go events. Kinda disingenuous stat compare countries US people huh? main focus here. Positivity rate, including tested already tested positive, still 10.89%. Central Floridian, every time curbside pickup somewhere, see flood people going stores without masks on. That’s awesome news. Brazil comin number 1 spot Food industry, healthcare, etc Mexico: Im destroy mans hypothesis. Yeah probably setting new systems trying make sure everything secure going fail start. there's lot people need office, companies making come back whatever reason. Flattened vertically! Infected people don’t magically show stats soon get infected. 

Even someone proactive decides get tested show symptoms, still need wait week event make sure would high enough viral load test positive. take week test actually processed results show official numbers. Starting wonder I'll ever able buy home....This huge shame........ huge part Australias success. Today announced 60,000 people gone hotel quarantine cost 120 million. Hart Island Ha, know. still low enough. good progress Swedish people, started mess *incredibly* high rate trust authorities. really needs noted many cases blind, fervent trust almost religious nature. trust badly abused Tegnell co., easily broken. think numbers going down, continue go time. also wish they'd go faster, argued many Swedes say things like 'I'll always trust government matter what, good citizen question government does' take time. really dysfunctional mentality. Trust great, always ""trust, verify"" things like happen. big issue highlighted slow decline rate deaths/ICU admissions suggests Sweden comparatively high count cases Europe least coming month, even risks uptrend. Sweden emerging outlier Europe everyone else getting spread reasonable levels. also leveraged well European nations maintain reduced levels transmission. God gave idea!!! bad God think give masses doctors scientists help guide us though. make 5k fine based honor system.  get caught pay fine.  scare people sure.  better nothing may outlet voice disagreement Sweden's action plan online communities.

What outlets would be? Like want discuss people immediate family colleges (also bit awkward working home) would go? put major social distancing mask wearing curb thier spike. 

""You understand, wear MASKS!"" Lol. Yeah, put month sooner hit bad. Exactly. found one looking specifics Maine.
I see cars RI NH daily. people commute work, get exemptions? 
If what’s point it.
I don’t think mainland states able enforce relying people comply, come on.
So weeks vacation Maine, someone would take three weeks off, two quarantine one week activity. 
Not going happen. do. disagree covid causes actual anxiety. Even 50% everyone got covid reacted anxiety doesnt change reality anxiety reaction vs lung scarring actual medical side effect.  ohh get plenty looks, beratement, even pictures taken lol. end day could care less. want live long enough maybe get married someday. they're jealous haha. summer sun kills virus can't stop indoor spread, hard people understand?

There's reason major uptick beaches parks open. mask going mind control me!!!! way man😡😡😱😨 /s agree entirely. temperate outside, restaurants close indoor dining favor outdoor dining open air dining would giving drug patient anyways. actually 'news' unfortunately.

(People respirators normally given Dexamethasone already) call “working dirty” No, aren’t allowed
To tell patient know many essential indoor singers right Yup. science seems support inside people = death. Outside PPE = low risk transmission.

Stay fuck away family. birthday parties. graduation parties. anniversary parties parents, ffs. may, may not. know self centered people really doubt even 1 million deaths enough stop people everything protect family future economically Also: survival depends do, think. fucking say... People south dumb Televangelists America, duo. Guess anti-vaxxer won’t need vaccine. people following lockdown rules strictest places. people conscience karma reflect consequences actions lives lost, families ripped apart, lifetime health issues, financial ruin families businesses hands. much people wanted say otherwise covid-19 living safest times human history. first time lot peoples lives come face face massive amounts death, it’s going affect mental wellbeing Screams immaturity. Well frying food 180C, gonna worry much. Correlation causation. solid evidence either way. Masks irrelevant, Trump like them, everyone left loves them. idiotic culture war symbol now. Read says wish management residential tower would put sign outside elevators said one household take elevator time. I've people without masks get elevator talk face. Source: Anesthesiologist

""We always used Dexamethasone anyone respirator"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, already using drug persons respirators. 'news' change anything, unfortunately. Especially since several companies competing first one make vaccine there's billions dollars involved.

I always get vaccines, one seems like perfect storm something go wrong since everyone rush announce first there's enough time properly observe effects. Yep! mom contracted covid neighbor said taking precautions, allowed kids (my little sis another child) spend time together. mom ran Walmart, masks. symptoms assumed allergies (why??) Anyway mom recovered fine, health could lot worse.

I heavily pregnant stressing family cautious since feb. neighbor child similar age mine said they're also cautious, let kids play. Turns they're running store toddler, masks, going weekends, visiting friends, dinners etc. Definitions ""cautious"" vary quite widely sometimes people even straight lie face, guess thinking over-reacting right make health choices family. bullshit. problem many sick feel sick. everyone wore spread lower. argument would give false sense safety spread would increase. recommend masks.  Switched outer banks Hilton Head actually, much nicer. Hospitalizations death rates pretty steady though no? Shocker Oh fuck, like common sense droplet spread infection *everyone warning us months* fucking works! Wow!  Yet everyone still praises Anders Tegnell government. country fucking shithole hate everyone it. resident SoCal spent every waking moment possibly staying isolated, beyond infuriating see many people treating pandemic like joke. They're malls, restaurants every available place even remotely entertained...so many people treating like great summer vacation 2020.

Movie studios theme parks pushing reopen operations record high growth comes daily.

I always thought better this, apparently overestimated population. America would take global pandemic make political affiliation.  It’s countries. US 500,000 annual tobacco related deaths.. brother working ICU said handled load taking patients low survival rates ventilators. i.e. 13 days, take off, watch die, give ventilator next person.

He said survival rate plummeted ~10 days showing progress, made sense give next guy chance. Ironically, happens, probably obtained herd immunity. billgates somethingsomething *dribbles* Doesn’t help there’s usually soap public restrooms reason Unfortunately, probably right. I’m really sick way things right too. I’m sick science intelligence rejected pseudoscience conspiracy.  ""It go away heat"" signed up, went school, carried lot debt... expected health care industry protect support staff.

This hits feels. docs take better part decade schooling, rotations, rounds, insande, debt, everything else martyr altruist. able attain good career would eventually make worth it. ultimately shit employers bad worked Walmart. Text Article:

America Broken Fight Coronavirus

No developed country badly.

By Michelle Goldberg

Opinion Columnist

  June 22, 2020

Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times

Graphs coronavirus curves Britain, Canada, Germany Italy look like mountains, steep climbs back down. one America shows fast climb plateau. while, number new cases U.S. least slowly declining. Now, according Times, it’s terrifying 22 percent last 14 days.

As Politico reported Monday, Italy’s coronavirus catastrophe looked Americans like worst-case scenario. Today, said, “America’s new per capita cases remain par Italy’s worst day — show signs rising further.”

This American exceptionalism looks like Donald Trump. It’s United States highest number coronavirus cases deaths country world. Republican political dysfunction made coherent campaign fight pandemic impossible.

At federal level well many states, we’re seeing combination blustering contempt science marks conservative approach climate change high tolerance carnage makes American gun culture unique.

The rot starts top. beginning crisis Trump acted could wish coronavirus away, interval least pretended take seriously, administration resumed posture blithe denial.
The Argument
Listen podcast every Thursday morning, Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg Frank Bruni

The task force led Mike Pence sidelined, members meeting twice week. Last Tuesday, vice president wrote op-ed essay Wall Street Journal well things going: “We winning fight invisible enemy,” claimed.

In interview Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week, Trump said virus “fading away.” Speaking Journal, said people might wearing masks show disapproval suggested, contrary credible public health guidance, mask-wearing might increase people’s risk infection. It’s surprising, then, many people sad Saturday rally Tulsa, Okla. — coronavirus cases spiking — went maskless.

Just weeks ago, panicked occupying kids summer shut-down New York City, thought taking stay retired parents Arizona. Now, New York gingerly reopens, Arizona become hot spot — isn’t stopping Trump holding rally Phoenix megachurch Tuesday. Cases also soaring Texas, Florida several states. epidemic concentrated blue states increasingly raging red ones.
 

When coronavirus cases started exploding East Coast March, devastating failures Democratic leaders. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, forced nursing homes take back residents who’d hospitalized coronavirus, barred testing residents see still infected.

As ProPublica reported, following Cuomo’s order, “Covid-19 tore New York state’s nursing facilities, killing 6,000 people — 6 percent 100,000 nursing home residents.” Florida, prohibited transfers, virus far killed 1.6 percent nursing home residents.

Given Cuomo’s errors contributed New York’s catastrophe, it’s hard say much credit deserves eventually rising occasion. Still, time New York’s cases got Arizona’s now, least understood state faced calamity imposed lockdown helped bring back abyss.

Arizona, Florida Texas, contrast, aren’t even simple things like mandating mask-wearing. Worse, last week, governors Arizona Texas prevented cities instituting requirements.

So far, evidence role mass protests police violence played coronavirus spikes mixed, liberal support demonstrations solidified conviction among many conservatives strict social distancing rules hypocritical tool social control. paranoia resentment long part culture modern right directed warning ongoing dangers pandemic.

Across country, public health workers faced death threats, harassment armed protesters homes. matter bad things get red America, it’s hard imagine political contain virus come from.

So countries competent leadership haltingly return normal, continue pummeled. mid-May, America’s coronavirus death toll around 85,000, Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham said long fatalities didn’t go much beyond 120,000, “I think say limited casualties war.”

By Times’s count, hit number. war goes on, Trump already lost it. underrated point. see recoveries vs deaths mean recoveries never went ventilator permanent lung damage. every testimony people hospitalized said disease absolutely horrible wish enemy. recovered simply means patient didnt die result virus, they're ok. “I would go indoor rally middle pandemic Donald Trump” Hi5  • eat drink situation need mask

Yeah, like wear one 12 hours job factory work 90F+ Exactly. lab tests done masks say prevent spread account insane amount inproper use.

I go public transport least 2 days week. masks mandatory see lot people put sake appearence either wear properly minute bus driver see them... fear ""I'm sick Covid"" need become ""I'm sick *with* Covid"" majority take seriously. study isn’t saying “masks decrease corona mortality”. Arguably headline meant imply that, that’s study’s fault. simply showing factors found significant link covid mortality, including mask wearing, cultural acceptance that, early encouragement mask wearing, plus bunch non mask related factors. 

You’re course right isn’t establishing causal relationship, aren’t enough controlled variables so, that’s purpose shouldn’t takeaway. still provides valuable data presence absence links large list factors covid mortality. I’d say lack controls isn’t nearly severe you’re saying, least non-epidemiologist brain could wrong course. 

Anyway, basically think good useful study first step towards getting full picture factors affecting covid, definitely correctly represented Reddit. Defund police.... suppose read lips mask on? Fauci CDC lied Also bet faster country shut doors international travelers, better case count is. Interesting - wonder also indicative countries took seriously therefore better social distancing etc well? Hard prove course before? installed* [***Clean Air (Chief Operations Officer Brendon) Zastrow says. ""We local Arizona company. technology developed members church. we've installed units. kills 99 percent COVID within 10 minutes.""*  system achieves bit magic air ""ionization,"" word pair mangle try pronounce it.* good excuse. People died lives. Yes. understanding rates going big cities outbreaks done well, it’s masking rural areas getting decimated. You’re downvoted literally parroted nonstop Florida would turn New York New Jersey hasn’t happened yet. never going safe bar drunk people, lets face it. like guy florida COVID killing guns shoot down? I’m sorry tell treatment virus hasn’t improved gone better significant way whatsoever. Care explain further? I'm sure understand logic/sentence? Dumbass one area thing. Yeah. remember, people tend touch face often. still cautious wearing one. issue reliability data. studies use different kits. done different labs. needs form unity within world put hard pressed faith data. continue great strides scientific community, still lack cohesive attitude amoung labs. Also reputation. studies dictate entire landscape. dogmatically opposed dogmatism merits times trying convince someone genuine concern need worry. know risk factors, lives comes contact with.

think tell folks nothing worry about. death course final, simply contracting covid long term consequences know nothing about.

&amp;#x200B;

th NYC walk without appointment urgent cares department health sites. think worry-some spread much false information director tied CCP. make obvious people cannot trust WHO. like claimed Hydro-cloriquine effective.  kind odds conclusions paper. What’s answer? American I’m sure answer it. C19 ravaging black communities much higher rate others, tied back inequalities, round round go. really no. soon know death rates. We're couple weeks spike, people drop dead day tested. We'll wait see. hope yes, death rate might stay age infection dropping, increasing survivability.

ICU rates seems 10%. hard tell data given relate covid. Again, since we're early increased rates, younger population, hopefully stay low. understand know.

What using gold standard? test positive half controls monkey blood something? new days sick/vacation time accrued. said ran could keep using days ""negative balance"". would either work couple years vacation days earn back pay back money got let go. decided I'd rather get paid owe time/money. UK clearly something right though, daily cases massively dropped peak still seem continuing fall every day, sure probable could faster drop people wear masks saying UK badly silly.

In opinion main factors UK many deaths are:

* Extremely high population density compared almost every country Europe (Belgium Netherlands slightly higher density also 5-6 times less overall population)

* UK massive international business hub course brings lot international travel huge variety countries.

* Honestly one part probably people ignoring restrictions even though police enforced, way could get trouble repeatedly going major obvious way.

The actual government response opinion worse country, honestly lot better many. majority countries outside UK also made masks mandatory, normally public transport something like (which UK indeed done, took quite long time reason). I'm certainly masks, stating fact requiring masks everywhere kind default position. friends Spain think spanish people admirable job.

But think important realise East Asian nations much better. need hold govts standard order sth. like nevet happens again. It’s average. trying pick holes statistics? mean pick holes argue statistic fit agenda average average end day. understand that. last couple weeks, masks pretty much sold out, stock every Swedish pharmacy online physical store. wearing mask still makes people turn heads someone wears mask, Gothenburg. 

The Swede refuses wear use anything stands out, ""unless everyone ells uses it"". There's nothing important Swede social acceptance. Thy code. 


Scroll second graph. Go Scandinavia! Instead got really big military. Nice, Werder Picture. 
But Sadly doenst Change fact, still get relegated. Well tourists. Many residents refuse mask maintain distance. Yes death rate going larger population 10 40 year olds. imagine 40 million age group getting infected? Younger people often we’re also actually giving tests people mild symptoms. shouldn’t surprise Tribalism fucking toxic.

It ended wedging us dichotomy people think options either take coronavirus deadly seriously shut economic activity, keep everyone indoors, fear life say coronavirus real, serious all, zero restrictions. 

Wearing mask became part fear would look weak, scared, old (because ""the coronavirus affects old people""). large part American society absolutely anything avoid people thinking weak, scared, old.

In addition, GOP needs good economy help Trump's re-election, Donald Trump's method dealing problems literally ""the power positive thinking."" literally, goddamn president's solution crisis pretend exist magically go away. Wearing mask lack faith either Donald Trump God. 

The truth we'll need collectively avoid large gatherings indoors while, means restrictions nightlife church, wearing masks. actually incredibly simple, absolutely mind-boggling one party's solution pretend exist.

The infuriating part that's preview what's happening global warming, much shorter timeframe. We're collectively going allow business interests fight single possible restriction tooth nail protect bottom lines, end killing vast numbers people. literally psychotic. Thank coming TED talk. heard Taiwan #1 China #16 easier visualize. 319 cases novel coronavirus infection indentified Yugra past 24 hours. data new record regional statistics provided territory's Rospotrebnadzor.  such, overall number infected Yugra pandemic reached 6 900 people.  flare-ups infection detected 19 municipalities. leader still Surgut - there, additional 100 cases infection detected overnight. Moreover, Nizhnevartovsk actively growing - samples taken another 64 people confirmed positive.  infected detected Nefteyugansk, 20 Surgut district 13 Nefteyugansk district. probes 18 people tested positive Kogaluma, 15 people Khanty-Mansyisk, 12 Megion.  infected detected Langepas Raduzhny, 6 Pokachy, seven Soviet district five Khanty-Mansyisk one. Four infected registered Put'-Yakh, three Nyagan' Yugorsk, one Urai, Oktyabrsky Nizhnevartovsky districts.  usual, main fraction infected made citizens aged 30 49 years - 176 people. 50 64 age group 83 people sick, 10 older 65. Amongst new patients 23 underaged people, 27 18 29 year range. nearly half cases - 158 - source infection traced.  infection occurs asymptomatically amongst 53 new infected. 103 people undergoing illness pneumonia 161 respiratory symptoms. dummies infuriating. Stupidly screaming “their rights” “breathing germs”. don’t get it. many agencies growing like wildfire. Like really ? still says it. added ""but listen local government reccomends"" Every time breath, potentially infected droplets come exhaled air, even nose.

Also, sneezing. Oh u tell mask works ? oh shit never knew thought covid joke , sad need study ...
natural selection fun:) That's talking point, think public health officials going intentionally lie public knowingly put public risk? That's telling.

The US high death rate people US fat. Mask wearing correlated lower mortality, many health practices correlated mask wearing prevalence obesity independently associated mortality models controlled testing levels policy. International travel restrictions independently associated lower per-capita mortality, containment measures viral testing tracing policies not. countries cultural norms government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased average 8.0% week, compared 54% week remaining countries. manpower 100% enforce law, laws place associated penalties deterrent effect. double checked Arizona

I used covidactnow.org He's always fatty old ham. alone. together. family friends connect phone. Try get outside every day, even means driving remote location take distanced walk. Every pandemic history eventually ended, one different. timeline one way another end continue on. Stay strong safe. case ranges asymptomatic, mild symptoms like cough intensive care unit. testing goes discover people virus aren’t critically affected it. Also surgical masks lose effectiveness wet. unconsciously bold managed overcome this, amount masks see covering mouths, pulled conversation, kind ""there"" actually covering face (this one hard explain) staggeringly high. 

Our locality definitely one wanting virus around, vehement deniers force, government instituted methods mitigate. Yes. willing lot reduce motor vehicle deaths. parts world much worse. Worldwide 1.4 million deaths per year.

But risk still remains even work money, yet still take risk order get work, even simply pleasure. certainly wouldn’t put shut driving reduce deaths.

What saying isn’t shouldn’t trying fight covid-19 reasonable measures like masks, etc. saying shouldn’t going far destroying society know reduce deaths. haven’t done motor vehicle accidents benefit get autos worth risk. benefits working society even greater driving opinion. Shutdowns causing people starve according major authorities like UN, WFP. certainly weren’t willing starve people death improve vehicle safety. People straight ignoring UN WFP like people power certain countries ignored said deadly pandemic coming. Except time, advising death toll much, much higher contagious thing doesn’t invalidate this. Even slowed spread non disruptive measures like mask wearing moderate social distancing contact tracing, 60 percent us got within three years, still wouldn’t taken much life Americans motor vehicle accidents, would herd immunity Covid-19 deaths would slow crawl motor vehicle accidents would keep happening rate. matter contagious? memory might little cherry picked.

The Surgeon General US said quite clearly ""the data show wearing masks public help"" ""wearing mask improperly actually increase risk getting disease"" wearing face mask ""gives false sense security"" ""masks ineffective without symptoms"" twitter said ""They effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus"" ""data quite say net benefit individual wearing mask""

Seriously... direct quotes. starting realize masks work sourcing probably getting harder, sorry.

I'm surprised (pleasantly) this. US seem full denial virus even exists. Aaah forgot two 80+ year olds. Right money age part huh. would thought. using example above, took full month 2 days. Heavy. Surprised lasted week given know.


Mxm. seen story 20 times here?  Spray. Seen collar disheveled walk shame. would imagine children caught could lead asthma. still know lot affects us years road. That's important take precautions. Yes saying that. That's memory Cells body do. remain dormant upon recognition specific pathogen body ""seen"" before, mount attack. Check distillery near personal disinfectants making sanitizer can’t find area Gatlinburg Tennessee like ten legal moonshine companies buy five gallon bucket need it. hope helps would nice stopped talking solely cases US started talking hospitalisations ICU admissions. think woods, pun intended. wearing mask normal stupid Alabama things. Today explain lot, including cases slowed weekend private lab testing closed. strategy works.. miss people tho 😅  reason australia want make shortages people really need them, doctors etc. worse. pretty well anyway, masks important measure. restaurants, restaurants like title implies He'd happy pass around insult everyone caught ""weak."" picture tweets. China? country covered outbreak 2/3 months? you’re trusting figures ?

China also took away every citizens rights. forcibly locked people apartment complex, allowing one person per household. Gave jail time anyone “lying” symptoms irresponsible. Long term short term?

Impact specifically impact significant portion US population 


It depends pose question really. C19 bigger global impact, BLM might impact people directly Anglohpone world

Never ever looking yourself, continuously preoccupied United States whether live us, bottom inferiority complex child unsure identity. Texas RGV here, yeap mayor made everyone wear masks, set curfews strict fines, everything control governor stepped screwed everything else. control kids going back class. WHAT???! doesn’t help Federal Government started saying don’t wear masks, ineffective. Surgeon General’s words based science according government. lied to. People know willing wear masks day one, told stay home instead, get. consequence lying erode trust, case erode public trust mass scale social distancing important? agree everyone us wear masks indoors, stores, malls, think best precaution combining social distance too. sad. hope babies ok. agree you. It’s like scam artists backed government. friends government, immune law. finally talk it, government want reduce 1m, reopen pubs drop shielding (including stopping benefits get back work, telling employers ""hope right thing"" instead telling allow WFH). Bro, I'm Brazoria county, let say ambulances running sound. shit fucking nuts!!! Every day bars packed masks.

I voted party &amp; went JBE. Rispone would disastrous even without Covid.

Lord help us come November, still hoping superhero appear run 3rd party. don’t even think bring vote President. I’ve never missed chance vote. I’d drive college vote back day. can’t vote either candidate point. can’t even cast ‘party vote’ clear conscience. It’s sickening 🤢 I've loop longer realized, hopefully fan answer. 

When become number one? actually watching paying attention, Roger Federer reigned supreme Rafael quickly moving up! can't kill people mass scale Based research studies read Feb March, think virus always ability, nothing new besides virus becoming contagious, mutate awhile back prominent strain now. That’s expected honestly want see progression long severity drops, normally goes hand hand virus works find equal state high transmission low death ensure spread. want thing get common cold status, stat!

SURVEY SAYS: trust this.

\*Disclaimer - course likely spread occur large group people, irrespective politics. point verify sources people, especially post articles specious headlines zero credibility ***looking here, OP...*** Enough 'WE CONSIDERING' already. news, sky blue. Congress failed job.

Because two party system ineffective useless.

Because donor class insisted reopen. Better testing means capturing large number mild cases went unreported before, total cases increasing rapidly. time, deaths falling virus infecting younger populations portion infected expected die smaller. know age infected matters lot. virus infected 80-year-olds, fatality would 10%, infected 40-year-olds, fatality would around 0.1%. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio result. I'm sorry going that. Really, am. That's awful.  I'm talking **today**, past. They've turned curve back downward, whereas Florida/Alabama/TN spiking upward, comparison, **as today point**. Alright I'm genuinely confused. outside running ... facemask required no? Pretty meaningless statistic honestly. makes sense. thought diabetics greater risk. known plenty type twos every single one gets metformin, including men. general population, literally side wearing mask health wise. may feel uncomfortable lets honest get it. one legitimately suffocating you, youre whining, sake greater health suck up, youll get used it. big deal. 

masks help reduce spread germs. lot people asymptomatic causing people unaware carrying virus. happen come contact someone susceptible covid lack mask wearing increases dangers virus spreading. 

Im aware CDC said first avoid masks. shouldnt said that, im glad theyve changed stances. whether reasoning avoiding masks leave enough ppe medical workers not, dont know. plenty asian countries wearing masks seen regularly regardless covid, increase wearing masks covid hit brainer. staying clean keeping germs yourself. masks might sole reason countries better covid response west, highly contributing factor. 

so many dumbasses like world keeping covid alive well huh less adequately

So agree, gotcha. Still seeing quote though. updates around choirs covid? month ago tripped article regarding study insisted *singing* it, complete lack social distancing, especially particular spreads started measures put place.  
I can't find anymore, find anything confirming disputing that. 
Actually, seen much updated information Corona choirs all. guess nothings changed?  
Note: I'm looking wave around single piece research going ""hey! sing now!"", just...would like updated information. church I've attending apparently starting in-person services soon, I'm assuming mean choir director might start pushing rehearsals again. I'd like able back say ""nope"". Abstract

Methods: developed stochastic dynamic transmission model COVID-19 one large urban U.S. jail among staff incarcerated individuals. divided outbreak four intervention phases: start outbreak, depopulation jail, increased proportion people single cells, asymptomatic testing. used next generation method estimate basic reproduction ratio, R0, phase. estimated fraction new cases, hospitalizations, deaths averted interventions along standard measures sanitization, masking, social distancing interventions. Results: first outbreak phase, estimated R0 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). total, jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% projected cases hospitalizations 89% deaths 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, asymptomatic testing within jails effective strategies mitigate COVID-19 transmission addition standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers prioritize reductions jail population, single celling, testing asymptomatic populations, additional measures manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.

Competing Interest Statement temperament hasn’t grown since first grade Absolutely right.

And lot hardship porn media peddles.

Instead media asking questions like, ""Why lunch ladies walk five miles work richest country world?"" get headlines like, ""America great high school students pitched scooter lunch lady without transportation.""

""Why forcing nine year olds run lemonade stands pay parent's medical bills cancer?"" vs ""Self starting Nine Year Old Starts Business support family.""

""I terrified reopening want hurt family we'll evicted without income,"" vs, ""Local waitress eager get back work."" state, them, contained spread, opened safely. 2.5 month lock down.

You lock require safety precaution end like Florida Arizona.

You cherry picked data news coverage make intellectually dishonest argument.

Probably clean post history effort disguise bullshit. Note libe ral parents still fall prey con pro-paganda. Plenty anecdotes life-long libe ral-values parents grandparents starting watch Fox suddenly losing sense human decency. heartbreaking hear about. virus laden air yet reached hvac guests talk share space? Well see, magic machine zap virus right outta air! disrespect intended, damn. Yup. Md tiny oasis right everywhere else apparently give shit masks, am, everyone wears one, even rednecks. even force Gov. voluntarily.

So glad moved Alabama. Long term impact variable ranging nothing severe lung damage. friend nurse seeing recovered covid patients coming back respiratory infections lung issues. Let fix second paragraph service wishes first. hand food disgusting, sights abysmal, people serial dick punchers speak English pretty well, pretend to. go around island using excellent ""Go Fuck Bus"" everything pretty reasonable price oil baron. Drop edge reef. people issuing death threats imprisoned, madness. ridiculous, especially hot one wearing get dirty looks wear one anywhere inside stores they're required testing means capturing mild cases went unreported before, total cases increasing rapidly. time, deaths falling virus infecting younger populations portion infected expected die smaller. know *age* infected matters lot. virus infected 80-year-olds, fatality would 10%, infected 40-year-olds, fatality would around 0.1%. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio result. Better late never? I've Uber drivers tell need worry wearing mask car, comfortable. told NYC week prior I'm me. shut up... following Western Pharma industry, nearly every major drug maker boosted stock merely announcing COVID cures excitingly close success. frauds.

This guy actually release product make money. 

At least frauds stick neck out

Abstract
More 1.6 million Americans infected SARS-CoV-2 times number carry antibodies it. High-risk patients presenting progressing symptomatic disease hospitalization treatment high mortality. outpatient treatment prevents hospitalization desperately needed. Two candidate medications widely discussed: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin. Remdesivir shown mild effectiveness hospitalized inpatients, trials registered outpatients. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin widely misrepresented clinical reports public media, outpatient trials results expected September. Early outpatient illness different later hospitalized florid disease treatments differ. Evidence use hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin inpatients, irrelevant concerning efficacy pair early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin used standard-of-care 300,000 older adults multicomorbidities, estimated proportion diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias attributable medications 47/100,000 users, estimated mortality &lt;20%, 9/100,000 users, compared 10,000 Americans dying week. medications need widely available promoted immediately physicians Look Japan. already wore masks matter courtesy folks sick, including people wearing winter case asymptomatic disease. going years, long covid.

They early social distancing guidelines stay home. recommendation now. released contact tracing apps 4 days ago. Yet people still packed trains Tokyo, Osaka, metro areas yet covid numbers low especially considering population density. know, there's *slight* gap cause effect ""going Sweden"" ""losing job"". gap Danish employers gung-ho firing workers something every right do.

But guess could **strongly recommend** working unpaid overtime well... Correlation =/= causation citizens reporting solely tracking. Neighbors, workplaces hotels reporting anyone know violating it. Let’s send back school virus doesn’t hurt them! /s Anytime hear Pareto Principle expressed, know finding true. work supply chain true every facet human consumption. also anti-1% protests forever doomed fail. 

So jumped well. explains success Japan's 3 C's (no crowds, close-ups, closed spaces). [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/AWhmP) Hahaha, oh man fun. Collective good? Knocking virus three weeks? 

Holy shit that's funny. Hey everyone, could knock virus three weeks! global pandemic over! guy cure!

...

...

..meanwhile New Zealand, South Asia, China, Europe people live... NYT, WSJ coverage China good illustration ideology greater facts useless.

Their correspondent Donald McNeil able good job explaining China's epidemic-prevention measures came show, Wuhan

But titles articles writes New York Times? first glance, headline changed beyond recognition sake clicks.

If mainstream Western media could accurately convey useful information, Western world would confused.

They're even good me, ordinary person machine translator, this. sorry much trees weed wax reading demonized grammar :) Shitshow indeed. SMH. least 2 weeks truth people buy level absolutism, anyone leans favor opening things fewer restrictions seems paint anyone wants even restrictions fear-mongering communist lusts economic destruction, anyone leans toward reasonable restrictions seems paint everyone wants even less restrictions laissez-faire eugenics advocate drinks blood anyone perceived lesser stock.

The reality one wants things outside *extreme* margins. one wants anyone die COVID-19 suffer long-term health effects. one wants deal restrictions behavior either. We're trying muddle painting want mild restrictions less mild restrictions monsters literally everyone disservice.  lots vaccines people cant take work them, important getting many people possible.

Fuck anti-vaxxers. know bit off-topic. quick question you. reason months literally posting Sweden coronavirus? looks like literally posting negative things subreddit /r/collapse . I've also noticed post articles every day like 30-minute timeslot next day on. Like clock. Literally posting subreddits even COVID-19 mostly /r/collapse . I'm curious reason looks bit weird. I've visiting subreddit since January pattern lot people noticed.

As far tell even Swede post articles Swedish speaking subreddits speak English even everyone else comments speaking Swedish. understand Swedish obsession.  winter unfortunately... already facts wrong. already read article see fact talking specifically cases UK, even though studies done long term effects show percentage recovered patients long term lung damage long term damage coronavirus. can't ignore studies they're want hear fit narrative virus dangerous. Seems like polarization well terms dismissing virus something dangerous big deal. excerpt:

Restoring nitric oxide dietary inorganic nitrate may consideration prevention early treatment would operate two-levels: reverse platelet-endothelial dysfunction associated thrombosis well lower viral burden [1,5,11,14,15]. I’ll get downvoted hell this, maybe could eat less? I’ve seen portions quantities bariatric patients eat. It’s wasteful disgusting.

Those surgeries medically necessary pandemic. It’s still early determine specific rate takes place kidneys. certain places, they’re determining 30% kidney problems: lung issues appear even frequent. virus affects anywhere body ACE2 receptors locates, people fail realize hear care read headlines death rate/recovery rate lung issues. soooo much virus presented mainstream media. 100% confident would hold court developed country... like saying fired use saw vacation. listen speak audible sucking noise? Yeah. theory golf - people behaving badly thing think sports everything goes along (press, travel, etc.) opens door that. Many people NY able say good bye loved ones ALL. hospitals fucked up. loved one (grandma not)... went hospital condition whatsoever (wether Covid car accident) either going pass away go hospital see them. 

Same funerals, people allowed go them, even funeral homes backed trucks bodies parked streets weeks weeks. Many funerals streamed (and bodies cremated) went straight city morgue buried much overflow. 

So sorry travel ban still stay cases.

The real economic social costs arsehole Florida partied hardy Florida (cause Covid Schmovid) wants see grandmaw NY .... brings virus city/state already suffered cleared virus. city goes millions dollars brand new medical costs business days ... one said grandmaw. they're not. one Local Denmark misrepresents situation, explained using UM's data. agree. think it’s important keep distance strangers wear mask certain spaces, especially grocery stores doctors offices, transportation/airlines, places essential people. 

But places like bars entertainment venues going probably willing assume risk so. thing I’m party friends it’s assumed accepting risk us contact. 

We hitting crossroads everybody “doing covid” differently- dome spraying groceries Lysol never leaving house, completely back normal nothing different, others somewhere between. one hand think he's stupid enough think he's invulnerable, hand surprised pressured people provide concoction every available vaccine dumb shit like It’s thing comparing apples oranges buddy friend talking virus released purpose not. verdict wasn’t released, petty lame virus unless goal kill elderly - even goal isn’t good enough job designed that. could see evil government use kill elderly population. kind doubt would Sweden, hope incredibly incompetent.  Iran start see turnaround cases 20 days opened economy. 20 days. Florida 6 weeks. Chicago took us 4 weeks start seeing decreases lockdown.

I really think grasping straws exact timeline. time 6 weeks data going noisy going able really make heads tails it. 

Now talking contact tracing that's another story. looking numbers looking events, going see dramatic difference explain past events. 

Sometimes virus chills town couple months anything happens, sometimes meet packing plant infects thousand people three days. local hospital 12 nurses got infected cardiac unit, within 3 days one super spreader. That's number people got infected ICU month April.

we like think predict thing little bit can. I'm open idea protests could caused spread illness. pretty obvious could have. city different crowd different population different number people infected. going able apply across board. Put practical terms: masks may *the* magic bullet here, given expense inconvenience mask, take chance? 

Personally speaking, mask cheap dgaf appearances. That's old school small c conservative. troll doucheiset order. #Sources post:

1. image format: Yeah quote quarantining state New York 🙄 Lol *recommended. can’t actually enforce states unfortunately. Trump says people wearing masks look bad. 

If incompetence contest promise America beat. Hi. Currently live Louisiana. means pretty much nothing. one taking seriously begin with. Went Rouses (grocery) weekend packed, 2 people whole store wearing mask. LA needs go back full lockdown. faster fire department arrives less fire spreads states trying hard catch up... Holy fuck y'all dumb. also source, heard statistic previously researched before.


Basically, antibodies going away sounded scary, going happen again? Turns out, normal. keep antibodies system constantly. every flu, disease, illness, vaccine ever got floating around constantly.


Instead, there's another thing us creates antibodies memorizing ""bad stuff"" looks like. Sounds like jury still exact percentage immunity, likely would get covid second time, effects would reduced, greatly reduced, non-existant compared first time it. tennis fan Djoker getting okay needs get massive recovery. "" We're playing ""what if"" game mate. Nobody said anything matter factly"" - first one, appears attempting say prior statement comment moreso discussing spanish flue example

 ""But infinitely people, mobility, travel, overpopulation overcrowding back then? "" - appears show formulating sort point situations differ today worst, saying differ better. 

"" October bit early? dragon suddenly appeared granted three wishes?"" - zero clue meant. That’s exactly happened, yet CDC chose reveal public. It’s black white; lot people wearing masks encouraging others so, unusually large group holding onto false pride pseudoscience discouraging others wearing them. create headline day? Imagine people realise selfish idiot hurt many others anti-vaccination pseudoscience bullshit decide drop support.

Nah, happen. Scum celebrities forever idolized reason. expect lull push 1 we're way cases people, experts non, predicting. Hence belief summer lull. Plus, summer starting knows what's ultimately going happen.

I dread winter. It'll back going nowhere except work grocery store. recently relaxed deciding pet food shopping store change come winter. know downvoted. true lot places. Many people get sick. people die. notion US fundamentally competent nation recede past.

Same US handling thing really. Never said rest lives, people seem think year worth smart maintaining 6' distance fellow human impossible. Oh sure let's blame protests, packed Old town bars, clubs fact absolutely one wears mask. sure, protests. Lung damage even asympto cases.

Kidney damage

Neurological signs. think caught back January head finally working again. plan shit 5 months. 40+ years old

Doctors reported seeing children neurological evaluation even otherwise symptomless. Rare seems happen.

It fuck 30 -40 yr olds. Guess old school admin staff is. Keep 2m regulation. Depends region, Mass one worst hit early on, lowest infection rate country. Going 2-3k cases day 20-30% positive rate, around 100 day 1-2% positive rate. host twiv throw shade wearing mask. remember early said help some. seemed confused recommended. Also end day twiv bunch virologist epidemiologists. video? corresponding article? Fuck no. January-February 2021. end 2020 possibly earliest. No. bad excuses keep hearing people bullshit. 

You realize county isolated system, right? heavy restrictions people pass through, travel areas, visit family, etc. spreads virus. Whether 10 100 years old, spread it. single person wrong place wrong time spread literally hundreds people.

Just things bad right mean safe. get bad too. younger people died mean happen. happen. personal risk low mean can't cause major damage people's lives. absolutely can. quacks various flavours, pandemic awesome promotional opportunity. North American sports leagues want continue, bubbles Canada.

But money talks they’ll stay US. total nonsense. Slovakia one place behind US. 5 vs 370 deaths per million. Cases 291 vs 7216 per million. Trend better Slovakia too. mean like [Snoot Wow imagine delivery man news belongs Yeah staying inside taking precautions outjust sucks, Nah can’t physically distance rest lives either leads back federal government. we’re working team, isn’t going go away. one hand, govener willing took stop spread. that, federal administration turned public health crisis political issue. forbidden drinking night. want another shot champ? medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fuck Beijing cases local asymptomatic. Early research also suggested 70C (158F) 30 minutes good enough kill virus.

The company work already environmentally controlled chambers made local places would 70c timer it.

If oven go low worth trying anyway. Good thing aparently Arizona it’s flu, won’t bad. Nothing like Italy, NYC Wuhan Spain.  Yeah, Thats Im asking. Im sure home country first wave asking clear definition second wave, like threshold, parameter, etc. Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia, large protests none experiencing increase cases. That's good marketing strategy. hard find them. Same. heck happened here... leave disease Latin America infect poor corrupt areas. humidity helps general. means droplets get larger, quicker fall ground. Wearing masks outside necessary there's high humidity, social distance, there's breeze. 

I would wager cases hot locations coming climate controlled environments. Fauci needs quit Whitehouse whistleblow. Yes, I've switched company cafeteria.... NY really problem wearing masks general.

Also, lots places world people resisting wearing them. talked time. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ayurveda proven work first time history

Amazing That's...quite bit expected. Jesus Christ... im assuming like many sub advocating easing going lead cases deaths? way hilarious, attitude towards wanting second wave subreddit reddit whole disgusting. Hoping increase cases deaths awful Probably already antibodies 🤔 getting unfair. done 2 weeks ago Young people always getting infected testing reserved sickest. testing opening people ifr dropping expected.

The problem young people spread classrooms lecture halls ideal locations many teachers older. son's teacher grandma example. im assuming like many sub advocating easing going lead cases deaths? way hilarious, attitude towards wanting second wave subreddit reddit whole disgusting. Hoping increase cases deaths awful pretty much confirmed vitamin E marijuana vape oil. able find group responsible. Everywhere NY outside NYC already going phase III week. 4 weeks since reopening started parts state bobble outbreak Apple processing plant contact traced effectively moment. faster drink water, less thirsty feel! Argument? making argument anything? Point thought supposed sort serious argument statement I'll see get got it. First Dimitrov, Coric Troicki. Novak. disbelief contracted SARS-CoV-2 disease. Oh...you actually believed government told costs associated treatment would covered cost nothing pocket? Silly you. Considering there's another round stimulus checks coming next month, believe put lockdown Apparently can't post unverified, credentials remain secret Thanks details. saw 50+ adults playing soccer SF masks yesterday. city cant even get haircut office server room dedicated AC I'm probably safest person work. one tiny window gives glimpse outside world give much sunlight. Good point (this'll make sound like developing alcoholic) drinking alone fantastic, done moderation course  throw mine wash laundry, also use Lysol’s laundry sanitizer assume that’s helpful enough. time use dryer trying shrink ones company sent - stupidly big. know many people India? Yeah. That’s fine. want antibodies drop farther get infection. exact thing 9/11....you really dumb af Fun fact probably last time anyone ordinary people saw one these. expensive hell new covid19 world huge list big price using one yet, somehow, still appropriate make broad sweeping generalizations group people. never apply. early March Chinese doctors already severe warnings Europe wear masks. /r/covidpasta True, dismissing drug, hoping effective. two days ago. surgeon general knows what's others silenced. Use brain people masks protecting anyone anything. ask ""Can breath mask?"" 

""Yes!"" anything breath getting mask air go it...

Smh trained see things systemic violence are.

It's funny say like -- almost like abusive relationship. long remember, we're trained, conditioned believe America great, America bestest, freeset country world, etc. Columbus hero. high medical bills normal. lethal force necessary control stoner park bench, valid response prank call. working 48 hours week barely able scrape by, lazy, worthless pieces shit. ok interesting, thanks! visiting Europe often people wearing masks? People Europe wearing masks Coronavirus, probably since Coronavirus due travel bans. sure follow here. 60 days anyways Huge sports fan here, wanted back anything feel like stories like going common place major sports leagues start again. I'm hopeful actually get full season Good luck try stay safe. Finding solid PPE alternative though think N95 masks still pretty impossible find non-healthcare workers States. rule. guidance advised 2m possible guidance.

I hate Boris Johnson fuck clickbait. Fools gonna fool. can't believe astounding stupidity people exhibit. go one years even vaccine. I've saying since February. Many viruses eradicated long ago could leave long lasting damage, letting COVID-19 run wild without knowledge recipe disaster. back people trying compare flu called fear mongering. fear mongering, precautions I'm calling realistic view point one US taking seriously. argument ""This first time humans ever faced new virus,"" asinine numerous things could go wrong new virus (lasting effects, mutation rate, etc.) Luckily we've learned lot far effecting blood, still know extent many things including lasting damage. Actually people stole masks hand sanitizers etc hospitals make quick buck. Never underestimate greed things get dirty. war times people hung next pole. Glad anymore though. doesn’t matter small chance dying. could spread anyone high risk. It’s protests Phoenix gyms, church services, restaurant friend gatherings spreading 90% virus. something needs studied more. know focus vaccine - rightfully so, many infected already could lot people ongoing health problems bills match. 2 more. 4 more. 8 more... Keeping eye Italy next month so. whole virus thing become purely political cope long reality starts assert itself. summer lull. expected WAY cases people acting now.

The lull push R0 1.

And expect winter roundhouse kick America's head off. ""Do know, son, little wisdom world governed?""

Axel Oxenstierna read virus replication happens nose. wonder wearing nose clip and/or primarily breathing mouth would protective infection? 16% SC! fuckers can't even bothered checkpoints airport, want stop people states? Whats point? Everyone acted late. New York ~~one week~~ put major preparations place hit. 

We still sacrificed MONTHS lockdown saved hundreds thousands extent probably millions lives. yo suggest stop let states run us (States able anything refused anything citizens?) garbage talk point. mean anything whatsoever. 

What people like get all? Seriously lightbulb turn on? may may accurate. Firstly, cdc said worth first including Dr. Fauci. I’m sure slow spread really don’t know much. Secondly, country willing require masks early probably took steps well caused less infections subsequently deaths. always wanted know pandemic would society pretends threat exist. 40% significant inline things read. Given exponential 40% early equals several times number weeks later someone power trippin'. blast every single comment. go girl, give us whole thread ""your post comment removed"" slight mention anything change fact another layer protection. Saying work 100% effective asinine. Nothing 100% effective. think safely say behalf rest country outside New Yawk we’re rather sick shit. Turned curve already killed 1,607 per million 23k per million already it.


Fla AL TN ever going come close NY numbers. NY epicenter fail entire world South say ""God must love stupid people, made alot them."" forced extend that.. noooo fking way gonna let expire, would riots.. real ones time. Got source that? Advocating quarantine hotspots fine, way original commenter combining smug sense superiority, victimhood complex, apparent desire punishment (...45-day quarantine?). know trolling, maybe someone else needs hear it. I’ve heard beginning highly contagious. contagious China removed asymptomatic cases homes quarantined prevent spreading families.

My point super spreader examples came months ago. current examples? virus spread well NYC March April everyone except essential workers stayed home. 

Are saying meat packing, nursing homes prisons due superspreader? never reported. Thanks filling in! state number employees tested, many positive?

Naaaaah. takes weeks catch die it. *sigh* I'm going again. Learn read. 

Lots deaths equal genocide.

Blocked. Thanks scammers people skeptical answering unexpected calls. Caller ID spoofing thing, whatever shows phone it’s ringing basically irrelevant. Banks/companies reiterating years customers won’t called asked sensitive information try keep handle phishing victims. would never give information someone called asked it. 

I’m sure won’t take long scammer posing contact tracer start calling people, saying online banking username password required disclosed verify identity pay call iTunes gift cards taken local cops social security number frozen. check posting history? pretty obvious live there. Yeah, lower Sweden per-capita. ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make."" nba least we’re going see players choose sit out.

i bet lot players championship caliber teams feel guilted playing even they’re concerned.

i’d honestly surprised end actually completing season, start.  put layman's terms? Thanks! Absurd hard OP trying twist shift focus onto Sweden Checking Mississippi:
After 5 days releasing case death numbers due ""technical error"", state saying fixed computers. 

They released 5 day total 1,646 new cases 40 deaths. never called genocide. reply based chalking DeSantis’ stupidity. won’t disagree that, I’m pointing likely calculated reasons besides DeSantis ignorant (I.e: unemployment) took husband 2 months. month 4 100% yet. lungs still hurt. mild case fever. hiking 10 miles Pinnacles National Park got sick. back 100% energy levels lung function yet. mild case. Thats cool Probably thing happening across southern states. got hit later, got complacent, started relaxing safeguards. People suffered quarantine fatigue stopped caring. implore read comment Well cured even hepatitis. Also he's yoga grandmaster. everyone knows Yeah, saw many someone's arguing oxygen can't get cotton mask day. Like understand doctors wear masks day surgery put one they're going die somehow.

That really downer moment. would interesting see correlation covid spread trust population science need first hand experience. masochist Americans site fetishized Scandinavia immensely Nope... wipe refrigerator microwave using them? wash hands using them? Waste taxpayer money. Several thousand young people get summer work theme parks year. 

This herd immunity bullshit turned well Sweden. cotton masks iron uses. Title read..."" faster country required masks, fewer corona virus deaths had: study - Common Fucking Sense Science.

People need stop needing damn ""study"" TV personality tell common sense should. Lemmings.

\*Put damn mask. People flock join terror groups promise food money support families 

what? makes sense. know two families one Covid case rest members tested negative. isolate sick person either. Slept one bed People grinding club every night , masks? Lmao great theory, problem also suspend property tax. I'm places property tax half cities revenue, remove money millions unemployment hemorrhage money. guess Danes forgot TTI exists, huh? maybe expensive vacation season rolls around?

""Use existing systems prevent harm? Nah, let's turn blind eye employers firing instead. Surely, wave possibly infected unemployed roaming streets going job interviews cause spread could've prevented.""

Yeah, put like that, guess firing people sensible course action people going abroad... That's take? know me. I'm already anti depressants deal, spend every waking moment *handling* there's absolutely nothing left *enjoy* him. 

My cup empty. There's nothing left pour. wish stronger person I'm not, I'm really really *tired*. Good thing already anxious, fatigued, disabled beforehand then! I've working home since pandemic started (Southern CA). I've called back work week, absolutely WORSE told start working home. future felt uncertain months ago... know think... turns ""doing nothing talking lot,"" policy adopted many U.S. states, great idea. Maybe meant insulin dependent diabetics? Yup. This. end there's vaccine runs course, typically three years pandemics.

A million Americans die this. Surgical masks much effective cloth large margin. get “should about” idea ? way people treated Doctor Acton absolutely shameful. know 80% cases asymptomatic.

That's extremely true really wish people would stop spreading incorrect statement.

Most studies put actually asymptomatic number less 40%. cruise ships around 15%.  Let’s go! know, calling people trolls bringing totally unrelated things like surgeries (what...?) turned wrong, exactly adding credibility. reminiscent flat earthers calling people trolls brainwashed soon someone points faults logic Fuck really soak useless fox, oann, talking point garbage. New York hit badly one highest traveld cities planet. New York city also 8 million people close quarters, put major social distancing mask wearing curb thier spike. Unfortunately rest country got 3 month warning ignored get see America become virus ridden shit hole previous. Saw coming, wait extra unemployment runs end july. idea else may may spread to, idea second question means.

The thing is, COVID really contagious. average I'm hearing get it, spread 2 people, I've seen lots stories last weeks people get one person one sick (what I'm guessing mom did, since lives pretty isolated life best times, let alone sick), cases come kids least 5 dexamethasone shots span early childhood thanks heavily prone croup stridor. never anything make cranky day. Definitely nasty drug. true? I'd never heard ibuprofen used fever all, spring. keep distance sole source income job, hell-bent believing COVID defeated things gotta go back normal? Hmm... Vietnam Thailand hot humid, too. Yeah, every drug potential nasty asf side effects. One dangerous drugs circulation paracetamol folk take without much second thought. 

I'm bunch painkillers back neuralgia I've two pain specialists say could withdraw one drug concoction, would paracetamol. takes two weeks virus. tracking, people taking test showing symptoms, results swab test, data compiled system takes two Yeah, many clear form experience stricter, early implemented, longer term measures = better economic recovery 

http://news.mit.edu/2020/pandemic-health-response-economic-recovery-0401 think agree one thing person says, agree everything say, intellectually dishonest. insist getting close shoppers? office.

Absolutely is. Everywhere people gathering indoors happening.  lead paragraph:

National Institutes Health investigators colleagues discovered immune system first responds infectious agents viruses bacteria, natural brake response prevents overactivation. new study mBio describes brake way pathogens SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, turn on. finding provides potential target immunotherapy might applied wide range infectious diseases. buy military grade NBC rated mask done it. trust me, stress levels thank you. longer worry maskless idiocracy hell bent destroying beautiful country within. 99.99% 0.3 micron filtering, idgaf more. stand corrected. article facts wrong. Yeah insinuating people take care medicine cheap dumbest thing I've ever heard. Really grasp straws know there's absolutely excuse letting people get bankrupted medical bills. NYC got hit first worked tirelessly get numbers down. bad thing getting hit first luxury time, like AZ, TX, FL, GA etc. had. know trolling, know, maybe someone else needs hear it. negative results still lots symptoms feel like absolute crap. Chills, fever, exhaustion, GI issues, etc. Probably bad test, right? comment nothing genocide. comment unemployment benefits. Canada installs tracking app phone monitors make sure stay home quarantine. literally idea agree first point Fauci lying masks led quite lot deaths (thousands, maybe tens thousands).  

But millions lives? 129k dead. I'm sure millions died since even hit first million, thankfully, close number. wrong.

I've tried look policy realizing strange sounded. looks like article misleading. policy stores [associates required wear assume particular store robust policy due local ordinances. Hmm wonder why. people might stupid wearing masks, continue gather large groups. Abbott encourages behavior enforcing masks encouraging rush reopening. He's greedy snake.  know right? Na, available india next week. also proved ayurvedic medicines cure big diseases. Dont know patanjali right pretty big deal india New Zealand currently achieving rate one positive case per 2,000-3,000 tests, include people flying in. one case per 200 tests long time ago, March April. nothing genocide wasnt worthy reviving dead comment thread. Even agree you. KovidKim exact stupid things Iowa, still doesnt make genocide.... excuse anything, see view such. simply pointing misleading data. Nothing comment makes comparison Denmark ace virus. don’t know anything Sweden, always assumed Scandinavian countries act together.  give shit looks like. There's pandemic I'm going wear mask. easily wins honest cost-benefit analysis. also try get New York residents vacationing states follow rules? includes COVID related rules summer, also usual rules like yelling teenagers understanding local help indentured servant. employer creating plan us go back office. one shared bathroom we're supposed wipe use we're allowed use refrigerator microwave. make sense anyone else? would say he's Sweden's answer Trump

That incorrect. rather Sweden's answer Fauci. Ok he's constantly spewing bullshit acting like child instead leader so... talking federal government enforcing quarantine upon NY. That’s quite different NY decided implement quarantine. Let's hope best Best guess/hope 18 months started... quite right. 

The primary public health objective wearing masks prevent germs spreading people. generally masks shown provide protection respiratory illnesses there's reason assume Coronavirus different. Exact levels protection well measured, particular masks may may good. But, protection better none, long let lull false sense security. 

Treat like car's seatbelt -- put stupid thing try use it. India going use ancient knowledge Ayurveda save world destruction.. like used save world ancient times..

Cow power best power. Please ask leaders pre book wonder cow urine covid virus killer drug. muzzle anyone? get all. * confused west australian noises * whos stopping you? trying get friends understand possibility never materialized locally one day really understands makes angry. admitting disagreements isnt pressuring man. delusional? point admitting conflicting opinions, also known transparency, seen pressuring man? Stats state basically show like 50+, danger Less 1% deaths people 30 under. 0% 0-19. county 250 cases....out 77,000. 
So basically....not much see here. state borrow money, year's expenditures debt repayment allowed exceed expected revenue due Prop 58 2004 (the California Balanced Budget Fuck no. Australia 100 actual COVID-19 deaths since pandemic began March. suspect OP's trying make happen. worry security theater mask going keep people interacting droves. Staying inside trumps mask usage.

You've got 2 options situation like this:

a) Tell truth let hivemind does

Not nefarious people want be. made point month ago sub ppl called conspiracy theorist. Guess it’s big misunderstanding folks, one blame something obvious this. lets heed advice, right? 3 year old that. Cries sister taking toy, give back, throws ground. 

Congrats 3 year old. Texas soon free disease leave virus infect SARS-CoV-2 southern border Mexico soon infect Central America South America infect 400 million Latin Americans. Yeahh Texas people getting tested even aren’t showing symptoms. Quicker results well. Honolulu, SUPER informative may sick know yet! take two weeks see symptoms virus, could spreading others. everyone wears masks collectively ensure we’re spreading germs little possible. searches says pro masks: say science communist read news article, headline. uninteresting shit.

Im trying deter boring posts sensational headlines, masks. so, wouldn’t almost every office high rise pointless opening don’t want spread it?

Three reasons politician: grasp basic concepts, bullshitting around, pro public health. That's something get government handled lock-down heart epidemic 

\- Outdoor market, mostly independent worker cannot afford staying closed 3 month : Closed due social distancing 

\- Indoor supermaket, ran big corporation could afford lockdown : Stay open essential services. 

I understand indoor easier count number people keep social-distance, people wear masks Ventilation system proper filtration system dangerous, that's lot if... Individual freedom essential, understand neighbors freedom safety gage actual personal individual freedoms cutting nose spite face IL, servers, cooks, etc. required wear facemasks times. patrons required wear facemasks they're table. Tables must 6 ft apart. working well here. like dark ages caused christianity following ""I'm responsible"" leadership style leader. Sweden called experts still wearing masks. point? known 100 years ago. much misconstrued, lied make sure doctors would get happened One dude tv lied. Fuck responsible protecting health community elder family. masks infinitely complex things

same gloves... jfc people act like gloves masks complicated. ""iTs DaNgErOuS WeAr ThEm!!!!1""

morons Absolutely right. Thanks heads up!  florian kohfeldt picture article lmao South Orange County resident, backlash insane. saw tweet called us Florida California. wrong. scenario intelligent people.

Imagine it’s like rest America. father toes repub line hard. Facebook stream nonsensical easily disproven opinion. many real conversations since wanted see Obama's birth certificate. still complains immigrants. 

I can't relationship even know bridge gap. Every conversation eventually turns politics. know outcome heart heart makes stop even try. Heartbreaking, see path life anymore. What's deaths 😮 2020 summed surprised pikachu face back people thought Olympics, mother mass gatherings, would safe simply would held summer. walked back initially thought virus able stick surfaces super long time. Ultimately it’s masks keeping spit people. They’re super useful keeping people’s germs out, they’re pretty effective keep *your* germs in. Hence, everyone wears healthier. doubt it. entire presidency throwing country bus increase wealth vanity. Sacrifice thing admires. likes heroes get caught, remember. traveles Colombia first ten days March. shocked much morw seriously people taking were. bizzare coming back US though. Everything different got back. left people goggling wearing mask. Within two days returning everything shitting TP Portland Oregon requiring everyone wear mask public Wednesday phase 1 goes action. 

1/4 people city close 1.4 million-ppl think fake taking threat health. 

The bosses work stated mask required employees, customers. 

I give mask wearing people 3 feet. Try MS gulfcost casinos open firework shows coast ongoing. least US Canada soon follow UK’s rules social distancing guidelines. new movies come mid-July. late 2020 sound slight bit ambitious? Meanwhile, America... principle same. Cover places spread germs. sneeze, cover spread cold whatever. something like Covid, cover mouth nose spread virus.

Stop nit picky. Masks reduce quantity droplets spew coughing talking. However, fit enough viruses nanometer kill you. vast majority masks rated stop things small. confusion comes in. help stop spread means actual preventative measure. 
Wear them, doesnt hurt help. 

That aside... mandates concerning... state required wear masks threat fine... except Trump rally o.o Ahhh past tense now. mean? Ugh. wish actively pumping N95s domestically. people exporting masks Korea? folks help?

Encourage people use drive testing instead going ER Urgent Care convenience.

People struggling breathe high fever chest pain need emergency care. people covid symptoms not. 85% complaints low fever, sinus issues, sore throat, mild cough, headache, aches. symptoms treated home counter meds. 

If think need care, ok go get seen! mind! looking test, please expose us virus take low supply PPE.

As much sucks wait testing appointment, sucks lot run PPE reuse gloves, wear trash bags gowns, reduce use disinfectant we're almost out! (These things currently going area could near future hospitals overwhelmed)

Again. need care, go get it. want anyone avoiding hospital need there. try use testing sites instead ER otherwise fine.  Yup. think thing opt Laughs new Zealand need wear masks cases. must see Trump rally Tulsa biological-terror suicidal-attack Lemme quickly put surprised face trade getting unaffected within cross-continent sanctions? That's another topic something never get Americans. travelling US summer (especially southern state) take sweet-shirt scarf. spend 10 minutes outside hot, soon go inside feel like entering fridge point comfortable.  hate “they told us one thing changed another thing” suddenly means information lie can’t trust agency wasn’t 100% correct starting line. ""Fuck you, grandma. Masks uncomfortable life worth minor discomfort. you, rest community.""

400 years ago, would take turns throwing rocks face. Lucky we're civilized. limited public event Clackamas county last week...many people demographics there...but many Latino demographic noticeably wearing masks. don’t know why, quite noticeable. hope news spreads Latino community, cause humans affect us all.

I don’t know article talking demographic.

Whatever demographic are, please wear mask. It’s simple thing do. wanna get mad mad protestors also spreading  Berlin. see loads people without masks bus subway? supermarkets? so, live different parts Berlin. sure +20,000 black people might think different would love see Americans actually take note wear masks sick public “must” go out. It’s fuckin courteous... caused harm good pandemic disapproving use masks public. even worse even issued corrected statements apologies yet. least Spain gone flattening curve weeks. Oh yeah wiki trustworthy source debate Dang! hope someone wouldnt that. Sounds like mental health issue well like first example sorta Switzerland still required wear masks recommended. beginning bullshit masks work general public. 

But even without requirement daily new cases staying around 30. Even opening getting rid restrictions.  I’ll take “Byzantine Sentence Structure” $800 Alex nasty bronchitis type infection November screwed months. Still got Covid March. think people revisionist history winter sicknesses.  Alright. Healthcare economist here. There’s still lacking evidence support use surgical-masks are, sole factor (ceteris paribus), minimizes spread public space. Many studies causality problems, wearing masks seen proxy, together policies, whether country reacted time, taken threat seriously. it’s really hard gather data use masks alone, since policy usually comes sorts policies. article straight example causality doesn’t mean causation eyes.

From biological standpoint really doubt made large impact, compared much it’ve hurt (private consumers hoarding masks could’ve used healthcare sector). I’m saddened see public reacted. Common sense lot better property have, mask giving people thought they’re invincible, giving sense false protection. Good job America keep follow social distancing. still worth wearing anything dont access N95?

Also beard, even worth getting n95 mask? lying us. thought virus transferred way made masks ineffective enough warrant people risking feeling protected staying home. lot complexity this. Give people break sometimes. told encouraging genocide. Welcome world people blindly follow authority figures. Trying really hard, you? conveniently ignoring source posted lmao Yeah... must lot crazy people. Makes worried future, went hike number people mask vs mask staggering. pretty PACKED trail waterfall California tons people grouped near waterfall counted three people 50 mask on. Less 10% overall trail... one wearing mask? understand young people getting infected lower fatality rate. Holy shit I'm honestly shocked (and pleasantly surprised) learn Walmart mask policy. needed place grocery shop Costco. looks like business. That’s is! People (at least SoCal) aren’t wearing masks “they think it’s stupid” “just don’t care anymore” “if die it’s die” “I need wear mask I’m crowd 50 more” “only need one I’m standing directly front someone literally inches away” — idiocy beyond me. Newsom giving green light reopen despite ~4,000 new cases per DAY!!! fuck happening? people fucking stupid?! many posts need? I’m advocating anything. It’s beyond stupid think easing countries like UK US going lead anything abject horror. politicians installed people lead seem fucking stupid understand this. It’s beyond parody stage unbelievably inept UK US handling excuse find humorous leaders people countries cheering reopening like it’s final minute World Cup final team scored goal. one saying that. Plenty countries lockdowns shorter England far fewer deaths. Many, including goofy president Hindu Mahasabha national political party, said cow urine cow dung used treating novel coronavirus disease. think person brought racist; story widely reported on, recalled reading saw comment. Obviously many well-educated people India would never listen advice. Didnt agree wait pandemic over? Bundesliga held NRW two weeks. mean offence this, I'm asking honestly.

Supplies run quickly, especially countries get resurgence well lot us still worrying getting/ evicted flights grounded  Maybe he's worried knows turn bad rough estimate 100,000 infections per day peak

Citation needed.

And see, ""Read link"", nowhere link say 100,000 cases *per day* UK. says ""estimated"" 100,000 cases end March, provide source ""estimate"". can’t wear N95 day. face shield better choice. interact people day? Poor shit. virus keep infections rise Mexico Argentina. I’m wrong easy prove crush evidence front everyone. wonder aren’t that? Oh can’t I’m wrong. Probably 70% Wasn’t screaming Florida wanted quarantine New Yorkers back thing started? shows multiple ways control virus. countries probably never major import infected patients, outbreaks even one wearing masks (I remember new Zealand strict lockdown quite long time). 

If countries mask wearing policy high infection rate, interesting worth discussion There's really question left now: Norway Nordics chose right path suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate whereas Sweden's herd immunity approach terrible failure. international experts agree point. know using /s, I'm wondering people genuinely saying that. rate impacts occur? percentage patients experience kidney failure? Wait wait wait. job home, office. But, office, can't leave office?

So.... like home then? LMAO smdh favorite people ones put mask get establishment requires them, wear chin guard soon get past door. Places, facilities kept clean. commenting specifically personal hygiene, particularly hand washing. right. physical barrier front mouth, nose, eyes provides level protection infected. Actually false claim American mask adherence terribly. probably technology would kill deadly virus can. rate school age patients suffer quality life impacts? You’re kidding me. Using big words change statement says nothing one says something lol boy know I’m blazing up. tobacco Tell liver, hoss Archive link: took tougher hold Sweden - saved lives corona crisis. stated Norway's former prime minister chief Gro Harlem Brundtland, leading pandemic crisis group. ""Many people Norway relieved today,"" tells SvD.


GENEVA former Norwegian prime minister physician knows lot deadly viruses worldwide epidemics. Gro Harlem Brundtland Director-General World Health Organization 2003 SARS epidemic since continued engage international health issues.


She currently chair Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), provides countries recommendations preparedness major disease outbreaks. expert group created World Bank.


Already September last year, GPMB warned acute health crises. Governments called upon ""prepare worst,"" conceivable scenario painted extremely contagious respiratory virus would kill 80 million people 36 hours. emphasized world's readiness pandemic ""extremely inadequate"".


A months later, new corona virus hit world.

- hope experience awful enough world leaders realize seriousness. virus outbreak one-off phenomenon. Similar viruses may return within three four years, Brundtland said press conference handful journalists Geneva.


""But countries must much better prepared,"" says, pointing GPMB release another report September recommendations pandemics countries. world's poor preparedness ongoing pandemic also analyzed.


Brundtland notes countries chosen different strategies deal today's corona crisis, least Nordic countries Sweden chosen different route neighboring countries.


- followed Swedish, Norwegian Danish strategies beginning. Early March, public health authorities Nordic countries seemed think similar way. Health care systems must protected overwhelmed. time, thought create kind immunity among population.


But three Scandinavian countries went different ways, tells SvD.


- authorities Norway wanted safe side take security measures avoid many deaths possible. Therefore, community closed.

- Norwegian government decided go Sweden did. proven good choice, seen last four months, says Gro Harlem Brundtland.


Admittedly, discussion Norway whether close schools. today considered chosen right path compared Sweden.


- Many relieved Norway, Finland Denmark governments strict shut down. see far many lives saved tougher comes social distance.


By contrast, Gro Harlem Brundtland believes China made numerous mistakes regarding corona virus. crisis crisis ""they admittedly shut even speak Director General WHO"". lid on, outside world received little information going China.


- time China communicated better WHO. took far long. took one two weeks China share information corona center.


The virus likely spread China early December, says Brundtland. early January, already crossed borders several countries thus spread infection underway.


- single day, thousands new cases spread virus. Therefore, day's delay serious.

In addition, China hit second wave viruses week. result, Beijing's 21 million residents locked down, schools closed flights canceled.


How serious one look second wave?


- scary, entirely unexpected. shows must alert virus many years. over, must ready fight back new outbreaks. vaccine, social distance thing have, Brundtland notes. 😂😂😂

Are aware iceberg phenomenon epidiology?

It's amazing someone like actually use reddit 😂 Oh fuck off. place censorship fucking north korea Ayurvedic form curry powder? Thats crazy almost listened scientists instead politicians. Mind blowing information right Smoking significantly decreases risks covid symtpoms light em People hording? lay person access masks hospitals, essential services.

This straight fuck up, since since corrected... going then? 39% isn’t majority... Well time lock everyone outside! nice A/C them! think meant Trump's response virus, virus itself. be, hes public servant. rewarding politicians actually job others nothing. even virtual church service *or* mass commenced Sundays home. Covid-19 turned healthcare [in Sweden] upside down. Suddenly, protect save lives risk becoming next victim themselves. Insecurity affect mental health leave deep marks.

As adviser Medical Association Direct, Barbro Schönning talked many troubled members recent months. conversations often lack protective equipment, heavy workload relocation holiday weeks. also concern one's relatives' health.


- Many people experienced difficult situations crisis management needed future, convinced that, says Barbro Schönning.


- Death become evident way. Healthcare professionals often used meeting work, death come close themselves. much know virus makes uncertainty great. One woman told beginning pandemic prepared writing will, says Barbro Schönning phone home office.

Another member said “you think everyone works health care thin well-trained [fit]. diabetes high BMI means belong risk group covid-19 ”.

#Health care staff extra exposed


The fear infected work accidentally taking virus home fragile family members create much concern. Even harsh working conditions ethical stress affect work care mentally.


This confirmed recent report Center Epidemiology Social Medicine, CES, Stockholm region. looking studies previous epidemics, SARS MERS, summarized potential effects covid-19 mental health population.


With support research, becomes clear healthcare professionals intensive care patients high risk suffering mental illness. vulnerable groups children, mental illness older, isolated people.


#Uncertainty lack support


**Experience SARS outbreak shows health care professionals cared infected patients increased risk burnout, anxiety, PTSD short-term sick leave two years outbreak compared health care personnel nearby city suffer SARS.**


The fact constantly given new directives safeguards procedures created great uncertainty among staff. needed support time contact colleagues became difficult due protective equipment. could also conflict wanting professional altruistic, time feeling fear guilt one's family risked exposed infection.

In general, increased symptoms depression fatigue, difficulty sleeping, irritation decreased appetite seen among working health care. Staff who, infection symptoms, ""chose"" physical isolation worried health, loved ones colleagues would work without them.


The International Nursing Organization also warns aftermath nurses forefront COVID care. call governments around world take care countries' nurses, support need.


#Could worse


The report CES written researcher psychologist Johan Åhlén. emphasizes basis previous studies kind lowest level.


- **This situation probably much worse. depends long last**, says.


There two things crucial mental health health care personnel, says Johan Åhlén, addition feeling safe protective equipment. One possibility reflection - opportunity professional guidance discuss work epidemic affects.


- important time talk going structured way, preferably end work session colleagues, says Johan Åhlén.


#Short long breaks


The second recovery. must continuous, least one day week need free cope. also important short breaks long work sessions.



It employer's responsibility ensure opportunity reflection continuous recovery. always work practice, Barbro Schönning colleagues Medical Association Direct alert early pandemic.


During March May, handled 3,340 cases dealt corona way. talks much longer usual, focus support purely labor law issues.


- ill months covid-19 worried finances. tell report work injury may become infected work. Others scared get infected intend resign. Many people experienced difficult situations crisis management needed future, convinced that, says Barbro Schönning.

""we've exchanging spit particles already"" No. typically members card order get free slot play. That's thing. remember people US would argue masks Chinese bought all. 

Now see truth. US could producing 1 million masks per capita, people still wear them. concept freedom right whatever set bad precedent lot Americans, stupid ones anyway fear fear reality.

Stop silencing voices! kind live saying socializing last thing people want thing people need do. Sure, job utter solitude sounds good surface. fair, willingness enforce masks early probably general correlation enforcing lockdown procedures/remedies quickly. said Im sure masks effective, maybe effective study suggests. Sounds like Ducey (AZ governor) I've actually wondering lately Trump slow-motion kamikaze mission  Elections wear mask go grocery store Picking takeout whatever Toronto. 

People look weird. Like no, looking weird wearing one. 
I’d feel safer going asian supermarkets far local grocery store. He;s forgotten man. Aaand.. normal Yo 'Abenomask' absolute joke. tried wearing serious dilemma - whether cover nose mouth area.

Something tells lot Americans would resist variation ""big brother"" ""comm-ya-nism."" know, also less infections deaths countries mass riots weeks prior study said population density wasnt correlated - inq fact, study said masks werent biggest correlation. Thats obvs. one headline pulled Taiwan numba wan following I've heard, ""Masks increase risk infection, wear mask order decrease odds catching it. catch it, spreading much less likely"".

I think they're forgetting asymptomatic people still infectious, mask usage ubiquitous would actually become **more** effective preventing 'Rona spreading.

Wait minute: That's Trump talking!

No, let's research. Science based common sense, every common sense wrong. pandemic nothing this. asked specifically cause death counted as. parent refuses cancer treatment child, child's cause death still cancer, even possibly avoidable. 

It believed right several thousand people died home COVID seek medical attention. simply afraid risk additional exposure go hospital. simply self treated hoping get better. logic, count COVID deaths either. agree, they're wearing masks maybe not? Definitely risky think it, extremely close proximity food even though they're outdoors.

That's brought covered tray left uncover yourself, server comes retrieve tray. heard they're Universal Studios Orlando pleasantly surprised thought went methods. someone anxiety lives place people wear masks...this sucks.

I wear mask go out. I’m often one ones. hate attention drawn me, hate spreading germs pandemic more. get irritated people can’t seem something simple. It’s hard. probably feel same. Apparently doctor fact checked politi fact tube (who gotten really good taking false info) left up. Hey, know too, name calling nice worse know talking about. Nobody born it. foster toxic behavior culture. make enemies people enemies. instill distrust extent deny clear demonstrable evidence doesn’t come someone approve of. let conspiracy theories conspiracy theorists loose space abused freedom speech point take pride defending kinds bullshit. don’t teach critical thinking young age balance scales said bullshit. get? 

A huge chunk population lives shock value, deny truth science, vote reproduce. 

Again. would much problem either taught critical thinking school made strict laws bullshit. none. 

The cherry top cult leader president busy playing victim pandering base attacking outsiders. outsiders anyone wearing MAGA hat. outsiders people also represents much dickhead understand responsibility towards people. 

Seriously. Fuck. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. fuck anyone doesn’t go vote fuckers November. elevators? least outside different inside  using masks definitely Sweden's problem, one them. situation is, different actually quarantined. Sweden things went like normal. us quarantined completely voluntarily. Hmm yes, floor made floor India lot State censorship / media control. Journalists toe line formally charged sedition. India, that's non-bailable offense, result lifetime imprisonment. 

Like said, hard say Indian government actively muzzles press way. already see Swede model less successful. Yet seem want changes. Ego. hilarious obviously extreme misreading post. only.

Because *so tired.* genuinely don’t understand it’s important wear mask nose well. Like nothing coming nose. Surely breathing air doesn’t enough force get someone feet away you? someone explain? Everyone seem forgotten toilet paper hogging, people would definitely hoarded PPE sold higher price later.

Hell, even recommendations wear limited distribution public people still attempted it. Watch Plandemic Yup lot dead beginning old people nursing homes. people getting bit robust. touch mask hands unless putting removing it

This actually impossible though. Masks comfortable designed used ""out about."" things keep moving getting uncomfortable. neutralizing counts right? 11% bad 3 months government goes bankrupt collapses? fucked then? state tax Florida that's reopening must. Nitpick: statistically significant even cheap surgical masks according studies recall correctly, one split air deals. think cool recirculate air over. someone got called back work popular mall San Diego, we’re screwed. It’s packed people. noticeable amount people aren’t wearing masks. We’re still taking cash. It’s bullshit Simple theory practice. realize hard fuck mask 8-hour shift? drink water throughout day, make kind money necessary sustain level mask changing. 

ALSO, SOMETIMES DICKHEAD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TURNS FUCKING HEAT MIDDLE GOD DAMN HEATWAVE, makes mask extremely uncomfortable fyi.

Anywhoo manage wear fucking mask 8 hours like 10 minutes. Thnx. agree clustered groups causes spread infection? Good. refuse acknowledge similar infections could happened protests?

The timeline matches. Anyone refusing acknowledge spikes part due massive protests rational trying politically correct implying black lives matter protest might blame shocked California’s lack adherence guidelines. thought “wow, got leadership that’s actually planning taking science account”. counties certain meeting benchmarks supposed open. like “screw it, open”. joy globalisation. mask production east Asia, wont export crisis, masks. Even better, can't hear clearly mask, instead talking louder pull speak peace even loudly first time, ensuring maximum Corona coverage. kids, recently longer spouse. lonely right now. Obviously safety large takes precedence. still lonely. Op mention country nuclear war also   ""My words chosen specifically carefully, read wrote wanted say, claim I’m wrong, going prove beyond shadow doubt I’m clue you’re talking about.

Choose wisely...""

I'm still waiting prove it.

Also sentence structure sucks. almost like science works. closed borders entered lockdown quickly! I’d argue that’s great feat US humanity general. Obviously end all, time period US also undoubtedly one best quality life metrics large margin. drive innovation science innate drive explore unknown one greatest things humans general. 

The seeds everything horrible every country starts humans things. doesn’t mean countries can’t achieve greatness still faults. could. didnt want too. Tegnells promises enticing SWE admin. Culling elderly saving economy, maintaining scientific liberal facade. quit March best friend hospitalized covid. occasional cigar cigarette since. unknown concept US. ""I wear mask make sure contaminate others? protect people? protect themselves!""  imagine patients getting moved Covid patients. doubt. Funny commented pandemic people needed still take seriously. Heads NYC week later. There's also quite many indications neuroinvasion. rock solid proof yet, many strong indications. may also play role. please explain biggest city country current world epicenter virus?   would thunk would deaths?  job protect public, yes.

The supreme court disagrees idea. Police legal duty protect you. seen Florida's numbers? daily new case rate (see rt.live) (adjusted # tests) already higher previous peak, trending up, down. Current estimates Florida's Rt (re-transmission rate, average number people infected person infects) around 1.4, meaning rate new infections currently growing greater self sustaining rate. Sweden's neighbors borders closed accurate picture actual situation.

Ignoring places don't, is. say Norway Denmark opening borders Sweden...

Put strawman fucking quote Local article posted wrong.

I posted two need wrong OP's article true. even defend one claim false. quoted incorrect bit reporting framed truth, misleading.

In way incorrect disprove point? Claims without evidence dismissed without evidence. looking worldometer website yesterday noticed Brazil's 1.1 million cases took 2.5 million test. That's scary. trying say PR someone literally vaccine bloodstream right could get healthcare workers essential workers interact regularly public vaccinated (grocery store workers, public transport operators, etc), that's *huge* step without needing everyone vaccinated right away. Include elderly/high risk well, life really start return relative normal relatively soon vaccine released. 

Also, pointed below, vaccine think one others getting produced ""at risk"" right now, trials bear out, start getting released en masse pretty much soon data verified. 

The absolute best case scenario would one vaccine end year, coupled treatments. regular Floridians, lol. Snake oil Restaurant work someone test positive. They’re shutting management wasn’t one tell asked 24 hours hearing someone else told. I’m getting tested little hour cause don’t even common decency tell members staff told it. can’t imagine plan point hopefully they’ll forced shut soon.  did. exactly facts caused prepare, starting January 25. ready month everyone else. fact it’s possibility letting thing degree US criminally negligent. 

It’s like Bart Simpson wants stay home school, immune system lets virus roll win.

At every corner we’ve tried protect short term economic impact, disastrous consequences long term. defending reckless decision misinform public,

Do proof decision? Trump axing anyone yesman. Except problem creditors expecting money back end 90 days, going limb can't afford pay bills 3 months doubt suddenly money. thought would obvious beginning! Can't believe still debate! already half way year  want die alone hospital ventilator help Jeff Bezos become trillionaire , it’s right American! Yeah, also thought it'd lower. like 10-20%. third lot. quite wrong little discussion disability burden happening early phases, knew SARS MERS long term disability fairly common survivors. all.

There 2 countries larger populations US, China India. around 4x population US less 1/4 number infected people. 

If treat EU single country (which makes sense given ease travel physically legally) higher population US fewer infected people.

No matter slice US awful response virus. Americans allowed ask questions? make assumptions, asked question open forum. cannot echoed enough. 

Florida isn’t unfortunate, alien landing gone wrong whereby state destroyed poorly rebuilt. 

Florida epitome happens people want elect officials look, speak, act, think like do, resulting chaos ensues it. see journal article yesterday circulating antibody levels super low months post recovery? Deep South Texas made wearing masks mandatory again, there’s lot pushback it. 

News  also full people tested negative repeatedly virus antibody tests, still insist COVID-19.

The tests perfect, 5 6 tests done you, point realize something else had.

Anyway, sub bit nutty people never COVID ganging together talking conspiracies doctors telling COVID. say that, control. Based upon data, actually 309 new hospitalizations. people simply discharged net 144. think counter example. companies derive majority revenue minority customers. know company interviewed many, many low revenue generating customers, big customers. ......look Sweden. England, love bringing down. small fucking Island able get grip this, basically fuck all. done properly since beginning well now. Opening back numbers means guaranteed another bout this. charge give fuck you, lots people know going die easily could different. Well that's great. *know* going want turn people away going result empty seats. challenge would even make court law. Quarantine completely legal. Misinformation like needs stop. absolutely do.

I'm working home normal crazy 50+ hour week System Engineer position, 2 daughters home full time. wife works Dr's office. 

Before Covid would get hour girls morning work leaving Daycare 90 minutes evening work bed time. 

Now they're home 24/7. actually got first break 3 weeks weekend. really awesome getting hang much Go back basement edgelord. dont doubt done somebody, state government reality. unemployment system still joke think would bad look able process claims timely fashion hand tickets track every car state. Oh honey. No.

Yes, group people 80% symptoms time testing. *Most went develop symptoms.*

This studies meant interpreted general public. study saying ""80% people asymptomatic time testing"" mean 80% people never develop symptoms.

The true percentage people never develop symptoms around 15%. 85% people know sick. reason believe rate infections going up. people saying gonna kick proper months 😂 Thanks Death *rate* pretty much back normal. Statistics strange. probably referring total number casualties high, yes. bad situation getting virus early many elderly hospice facilities, wreaked heavy toll places. impact masks rest society would less tragically unprepared privatized and/or underfunded/understaffed elderly homes had. 

It's reported virus spreads clusters rather uniformly society, early clusters care weakest individuals final time life.

Hearing argument like hearing ""You people sat part boat got hit torpedo, many drowning, therefore attempts saving worse explode. Please pay attention strategy entering life-boats stop drowning purpose."" That's interesting. know much damage was? even coughing can't imagine bad damage I'm certainly expert. I’m not. supportive serving red wine day... like twice week get it. reason current automod lot “eff party” type comments brigading devolve unproductive threads spam. see it’s frustrating good commenters deal something that’s place circumvent trolls brigading.

Students Wear masks. Get old professors n95 masks. 

Problem solved need speculate. Fauci said exactly testimony congress. fact.

/Whether right thing another story. Sorry, based standard, longer credible. limit interactions hacked American research labs stole lot data use vaccine Question: thing contagious led believe? Maybe seems contagious since thought showed Jan Feb. around since November October, means spread slower hitting critical mass New York making seem like showed where.

And wearing along, production would already people would used seeing wearing about, dumbfuckery politicization, whatever. you. think probably talk kids. Neat! would be? Ah conspiracy? going article said. think parents keeping kids away anymore. see neighborhood. still trying avoid others, one kid helps. job shift responsibility away them, try keep entertained shoulder responsibility.

Makes sense, widespread testing criteria test less strict. expect overall mortality drop reported cases drop well. russia first point fingers accusing USA spreading covid-19 medical conference China.

Although agree coronavirus cure would result modern medicine, say ""quackery"" rather ignorant. true. trust much possible take necessary precautions myself... Unfortunately, can't put trust faith general population. guess we're trying get much work done humanly possible inevitable second call quarantine. vax Novak? that's scary. look state license plate? catch already. Press X doubt. agree, CDC government failed still continuing fail people. need ones stop this, requires us individual thought compassion fellow human beings, unfortunately, fucked. know downvoted. say old senior allowed see family 2 years risks infection, ignore, specially one feels much time around. Yup. Obesity, low IQ, poverty, low education, fundamentalist Christianity, opposition science make bad combo. TCM fraud? Really? opinion. works. Left Vietnam better future said worth even it’s, point, effective we’d like be,” said Dr. Susan Hassig, associate professor epidemiology Tulane University. 

Thing get transmission rate 1, anything helps may worth especially stuff already know works. Question: number recoveries large population (over 1M), expect ""post-Covid syndrome"" start getting even broad definition? lot opportunistic infections, complications, co-morbidities associated virus. anyone tracking compiling ongoing effects? virus bad enough destroying lungs. Damaging brains, kidneys, etc escalation don’t think people anticipated.

Now know clotting issue (though don’t know know happens) seems alleviated anticoagulants. That’s good news least. different drunk driving IMO.

Unless prove already - I'm going trust without mask. Teachers already died outside classroom. makes think things open up? telling kids anything. speaking obsessed virus Reddit. 3+ weeks question board work ppl asking hazard pay concern work awnser “come talk office “ literally everyone single one there’s one keeping eye new ppl wear mask neither it’s sucks it’s scary every single day 5 ish get message let know another confirm case warehouse confirm far got maybe 80 ppl phx6 confirm Oh no! safe, dadbod, make sure update us. feel okay? may also pre-symptomatic, age physical condition high probability mild case develop symptoms.

I hope strictly self-isolate avoid infecting people around him. positivity rate data handy? I'd love see graph, positivity graphed instead. Them, unless N95 Dont bother thinking that, people still wondering wear mask not... Everyone makes zero sum game. not. takes one person spreading become problem again. increased cases protesting adds increased cases memorial day adds top ignorant taking seriously still. going contribute spikes cases. 

The sides conflict spreading disease not. winning. losing less badly. Sure nice country fired job going place allowed go to... big study found 60% asymptomatic people COVID-19 damage least one lung, 30% both. people rationalizing it’s ok go normal things wear mask? 

It’s probably fact every state opening government largely pretending pandemic over. high rise office buildings recirculate air. meaning air combined together hvac system. building manager decide much new air introduced system. costs money filtering, heating, cooling air. there's incentive recirculate air buildings without introducing outside air. contrast two countries staggering. Canadians lot work we’ve fumbled much states comes mass testing (looking Ontario) &amp; slow responses (it took _forever_ border close). However, government leaders let public health experts take lead &amp; allowed jobs explaining epidemiology virus &amp; providing health recommendations public. Trump GOP, science-denying head-in-the-sand approach &amp; politicizing basic health measures like mask wearing cause current clusterfuck many parts US. complete failure leadership lack trust scientific community it’s blatantly obvious clue they’re doing. politicians care much re-elections, it’s amazing myopic repercussions incompetence public opinion. Viruses don’t give shit political ideology it’s sad see many people suffer trusting buffoons. Also, masks would covered orange sweats off. Me. I'm moving LA three weeks. Gonna take precautions, I've trying move back 5 years finally got approval. worked home last 105 days. Outside trips ICA Systembolaget (I go hours, since it’s near home) also haven’t left home times purposes.

Although bike rides 4AM nice, hot day anyway. Ok still 6,000 people virus. negatives today still contract tomorrow. Low humidity also helps evaporates fluid droplet virus stored in, exposed air virus breaks quickly. HOWEVER, closed crowded indoor space doesn’t allow enough TIME happen next person came contact fluid droplet. Dmitrov tested positive day... Novak, Zvevrev, Theim party week ago. saying ""lock downs bad, cause global famine"" per UN?

Am correct? NBA/NHL still sure this? I’m sorry tell treatment virus hasn’t improved gone better significant way whatsoever.

That's responding to, bringing good news, I'm partaking argument. know downvoted, seems unfair. Arnold don’t know vision? I’m 17 idea want life. know - I’m way excited go watch movie Garry’s Mod Minecraft something real movie theatre. coronavirus causes terror, redditors comment it. 

If dont like reddit, leave. Watch happens number visitors 14 day quarantine imposed.

I'm really sure good (from beneficial standpoint legalizing brass knuckles). lock state rest America. Florida. 

But know impossible task. Might well buy oculus. Theatres go way cruises 2021. Well could ignore experts say wrong see turns out. sure lying numbers thinly-veiled attempt save lives. djoker heard Technically speaking perhaps, that's real rules lawyerly unrealistic. spirit what's going say ""Sweden's neighbors borders closed"" since, effectively high degree do. actually misleading less representative facts ground phrase do. genius medical experts western countries kept saying masks necessary cases worse beginning. reasoning never even made sense they're facing consequence backtrack statement. bullet points spot on. 

However, USA, Trump moronic anti science administration, USA conservative media, brainwashed minions continue spew BS masks necessary. problem.  


There absolutely unified front USA masks all. USA '#1'....in COVID cases deaths. fraction people roving bands looters. It’s one matters buddy /s Shoo, shoo! *hits covid face broom* stupid takes effort too. Information may available, much overwhelms people. Many live self-fulfilling eco chamber silos information limited. used accessible knowledge, would correct, unfortunately many find path agrees never ventures away it. a,so media outlets constantly try add doubt everything around us. really miss days media cared right, using validated multiple sources wrong said were. days. everybody hvac building management industry probably knows high rise office buildings vertical cruise ships. amount lawsuits would involved admitted buildings spread viruses would bankrupt all. making decision, honest get bankrupt keep quiet let others figure out. job government perform studies hvac systems. already know virus aerosolized, bet hvac systems coated sars-cov-2.

high rise apartments seem recirculate air, poorly built building could easily lead spread diseases. True, sucks comments like get downvoted denial. Can't say good lol Yeah, might smoking rest world. LOL 😂 *horror*! like Indiana, who's...checks notes...50th! Worst day day told could continue work home come back. miss hanging kids day.  know I'm ""lucky"" still job, showed much hate job pointless sit instead home day. Lol Yes Point millions shut lives occupations virus impact besides spreading herd immunity. get go, vulnerable isolated rest kept living. Biggest cluster f--k world history. Hospitalizations ICU cases follow week two behind new cases. deaths another week least behind that. 

If you’re waiting see go react you’re gonna waaaaay late. Dmitrov tested positive day... Novak, Zvevrev, Theim party week ago. live Beijing, delivery riders wear mask gloves long dont touch bag without gloves okay sub full nothing misinformation... think *genuinely* thought 'everyone would get eventually, matter what'. Tegnell, Giesecke proponents herd immunity Sweden saying early on, quite recently (although narrative seems tamped late). 

So really went idea, long time saying eveyrone going catch Sweden eventually terms deaths, Sweden would come ahead would go hard part faster countries, would acheive herd immunity soon (they saying first April, May June stopped talking much near term mention fall possibility). 

Here examples saying variations 'everyone get eventually, matter what': *pikachu surprised face* still may cause long-term damage lungs. Time tell. whole world it, right? IHME model even factor masks. however factor gathering limits, closures, mobility. Using incorrect statistics reason sacrificing people's lives save future sincere, kiddo. 

Given popular agenda driven opinions (bigly votes) I'd say need work agitprop. Yeah except many Western countries medical experts kept saying masks necessary cases would even worse personal health. wonder people unwilling wear masks, joke. get moon exclusively European talent couldn’t without it. chief scientist. need technicians facilities US provided.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dumb wrong. Duh. Seatbelts too. updated 7 day rolling average new positive test cases per region USA, per 100k population. There’s culture component. Americans struggled, still do, understand one wears mask protect others. It’s like wearing pants stop people peeing you. 

Americans think people wear masks protect themselves—which true sometimes. Also, there’s general sentiment of, “well now, it’s like catch it.” disincentivizes sick people use masks. So, short, agree false Sweden’s Scandinavian neighbors closed borders Swedes. NoVaxx DjoCovid many levels. People continue visit NY lot reasons, like business family. NYC vital economic hub US major population center. Also, lot people ran away flooding back first wave control here, rising parts country. precisely runners seed new waves infection. Reality chaotic. spread takes one crowd another. 🤷‍♂️ IKEA Sunrise?  Geopolitical dominance overspending military, budgets like education health garbage. Geopolitical dominance going war country didn’t even attack us extract oil.

If country America doing, America would call bad guy. NC, everything everywhere open. It’s funny Myrtle beach SC ton covid cases hotels restraunts. Incorrect. screaming states preventing entry New Yorkers. Rhode island preventing entry initially finally settled requiring quarantine instead.

Quarantines state visitors pretty common. pandemic shmandemic rite. watch marvel humans went moon even fucking tie shoelaces. states 1 require balanced budget. No, dude, no. Leave bubble, live place like 10% wearing masks. quarantines enforced? feel like everything suggestion point mean shit. Sure, slavery used keep labor costs, like illegal immigrant labor today. support illegal immigration support moral equivalent indentured servitude. I'm sure located, American confirm we're ""cheering"" opening. fact, overwhelming majority communications see people speak (including friend family exceptionally different walks life) indicate adject horror handled national leadership. absolutely disgusting uniquely terrible, undoubtedly one absurdly mishandled public health crises nation's short history. 

There definitely many ""pro-reopen"" people here, too. select group people simply ignorant conspiracy theorist science deniers actually critical thought simply feel lie overblown. victim politicized fear ignorance leadership pushing. saddening disgusting, shock. objective people, though. fortunately represent us. ones news likes report about. 

Some us, included, live states far taken situation seriously. even state slowly cautiously reopening (mostly economies screwed), cautious. biggest problem obviously exposes social inequities lack socialized policy/infrastructure take care people. sad. course happens time (and because) one stratospherically inept national leaders history mankind. 

So, careful claim Americans cheering this. Many us disgusted horrified anyone handled national ""leadership."" Absolutely. unfortunate people framed 'reopening economy' solution, pitting us other.

Fundamentally, of, social avoidant/fearful flourish virus control. *Illegal Farmworkers Refusing COVID Tests Fear Losing Jobs

Fixed it.... Fauci. ""Unacceptable""? 

Buddy, one accepted it. Fauci told American public masks don’t prevent catching therefore, people compromised immune systems whose wear masks. early stages. Look up. actually looked new cases Florida right now? They’re pretty alarming trajectory. I’m sorry hear that. cousin died flu 2012. 20s. reality lot people die flu, usually young, otherwise healthy individuals. made change behavior though. refuse go work sick. make sure get flu shot. quit biting nails. Definitely makes re-think practices. Coronavirus dialed me. thing hope change behavior since cousin’s death maybe saved someone pain death. 

Grief hard, especially never expected it. I’m sorry loss. ❤️ Aren’t filming Amazon Middle Earth show there? I’m quick opening support BLM, see many comments indoor air circulation, people walking restaurants seeing 20+ people crowded together... LA county, hundreds thousands people shoulder shoulder protest, even mask outdoors, there’s much numbers. Isn’t obvious especially timeline, protest wave hitting? Like majority healthy people get hit this, athlete. What's point? That's unacceptable excuse. inform guide public. done without lying treating like 5 year olds. They've done irreparable harm science trust medical professionals saying masks work. wife's ex, 100%. baby Friday super careful everything. think lot people knew Americans entitled narcissistic. I've definitely heard American tourist stereotype. god damn, realize fucking bad pandemic. dumb??? already contact tracing system place.

Sounds like America's greatest fear come true. never understand public figure would shoot foot like that. Maybe spend every hour complaining sway two people promote masks forum actually fucking matters (aka people already agreeing) things true. Masks force multiplier measures, even ""slow woefully inadequate"" government response outperform equally slow woefully inadequate responses masks adopted early (or pre-existing practice wearing masks crowded places).

I've seen estimates mask usage reduces transmission much 60%. takes COVID-19 [catastrophic R₀ still terrible, far manageable, R₀ 2.3 mitigation.

To put perspective, seasonal flu R₀ 0.8 2.1. burdensome deadly, weather flu every year without major societal breakdowns. Diphtheria, contrast, R₀ 1.7 4.3. populations vaccination levels drop herd immunity threshold, Diphtheria almost immediately becomes major cause death. [as happened USSR early everyone South could waited Memorial Day reopen, could hit thar 60 day target pretty much every state stay home. Yeah think lot people grasp bad winter potential be

Or want admit bad could potentially be. I'm going try pick PPE donate hospitals come winter. know could use think winter ends bad it'll needed then. I'm envious countries took seriously beginning (mad props Mongolia citizens despite hardships faced it).

I hope (and almost everyone else - dad contract covid fucking moron care) stays healthy winter. hope see next spring, lol. Sweden: 5,122 deaths / 507 deaths per million

Norway: 248 deaths / 46 deaths per million

Denmark: 603 deaths / 104 deaths per tea niece he's lost control bowels, adult diapers, that's funky shuffle. agree assumptions.  Trump admitted wasn’t joking said need slow testing. Actually, seems Surgeon General Adams recently tried invert symbolism wearing hard-line conservatives - saying would promote four hours long, anyone would bored. Reminder, CDC politicized estimate. epidemiological consensus least least double number. see coming, tbh seem missing point. argument deaths lower US better treatment. steroid isn’t reason seeing lower deaths. anyone think BLM protests unconscious effect people, seeing people droves, people rationalizing it’s ok go normal things wear mask? thought people taking seriously month ago looks like enthusiasm almost entirely disappeared. feel like people state (NC) would want us exactly Sweden unfortunately think gov going drop bomb require face mask state wide Friday. can’t wait see everyone freak pisses we’ve waited late game require something basic. rednecks think people weak wearing one going wear one it’s actually enforced unlike lockdown. ""psychological disturbances""....

Covid create this. People may mental health issues... lumped together symptoms covid actually responsible for.. Zero empirical evidence? Wrong. ignorant little chimp mean evidence masks work.

That's exponential growth. people get point. single person exposing group cause outbreak. matter time unless get R1. numbers truly flat, percent positive would decrease tests. 

We’re early stages epidemic anymore testing capacity growing leaps bounds. places tests run means people went doctor symptoms asking test. don’t want wish illness anyone, get sick mild asymptomatic, reinforce belief “it’s liberal hoax/it’s flu!” mentality.

They need get sick, badly, take seriously. think exercise dicey don’t yard right anyway. can’t exercise outdoors live feel remotely safe provide examples used way?

2. I'll give penny right now, every day next thirty days I'll give twice much gave day (2 cents tomorrow, forth)

What honestly think people would choose? believe 95% people would choose million dollars whereas second option worth 20 million (you get 10 million final day alone) March 28th, 2020 via Washington, DC (CNN) New York Gov.

Without aggravations job, feel urge destress beer, three. Oh Trump coming today. masks required sign waiver. Sigh... plus “patriots” won’t wear masks.

That said, need 1 vaccine vaccinate 7 billion people, would assume chinas first approved vaccine first used kill pandemic tons spots Arizona closed due employee outbreak. pretty sad. went eat last night literally first 5 spots wanted go signs door re-close point, someone knew NYC he’s died, probably got scary briefing adults WH, came looking seriously scared, willing whatever medical public health experts recommended. presser says it’s “the biggest decision life”... sure date. 

However, within week, walked back went back deny-downplay-distract-divide tactics. guess Larry Kudlow like convinced economy would crash he’d lose election listens liberal public health nerds (or something like that). 

Whenever saying “a lot smart people saying” pressers around time, seemed like referring economic advisors rich friends. seems equivalence made ""they can't enforce it"" ""they catch everyone.""

Those speed limit signs, completely unenforceable! *town* blocked driveway? local government? seem like simply quarantine. assessed risk. see. one chance past couple months, people staying home. think they'll able pull knew risks. assess risk every day. mean can’t believe families pit bulls own. someone lives Spain, disgusting beyond words. WTF guys there? Thanks, Doctor. Also accept 1 3 numbers I'm seeing quoted studies hospitalized patients, makes 30% wildly overblown.

I translate mean really sucks people. already knew that.

Usually time involved creating vaccine comes needing funding (no limit here), brand new research needed (it seems SARS/MERS given us head start), failure rate point starting trails (we 80-100 vaccines development - one bound work). 

There lot things working favor here. would think Fauci inside information trials going also, making statement big deal imo. People used hunt gather food. people get PTSD everything guaranteed.

Better super late point almost matter damage done never. Why? public health order, like Colorado.

As misdemeanor, local law enforcement and/or local public health agencies would first reach voluntary compliance education, county/district attorneys bringing civil criminal action public health director requested it. County attorneys seek judge's orders state court force individuals comply.

At least CO law, state health dept authority enforce local health agency unable unwilling to, state attorney general also seek order judge state court compel compliance. think word looking “ungood”. known made choice. knew risks. respect freedom choose.

However, look bad even compared parts CA much less AZ. everything bigger TX don’t think it’s stupid anymore, way beyond that. NJ likely wearing masks respecting distancing gatherings though, not? Again, huge gatherings protests wearing masks haven’t seen spike, should’ve added masks disclaimer well.

Florida, Alabama, Texas, North &amp; South Carolina, Arizona California huge tourist gatherings Memorial Day minimal PPE sight. They’re also seeing rise cases since then. one outlier seems Missouri, meaning also huge gatherings masks aren’t seeing rise states mentioned are. go it. It’s going get better soon.

The harsh reality is: virus ran course EU killed everyone would died already. US many death happens big population. 


The average covid death 80. that's life expectancy. people literally supposed death already.

Europe already moved virus going back normal.

Octavian played dirty game. Drank usual March. April 3rd said okay I’m done. 

Let’s talk starting smoking 5 years non smoker. Ahhhhhh. way people know behaving, probably take long happen. think point would elect new government. like last ditch nuclear option. yeah, seems theoretical. again, virus lock seemed theoretical... want come across dispariging (all research encouraged, better) someone researching physiological  genetic aspects hosts , relation covid-19 disease burden mortality rate-- view better therapeutic strategies hope efforts humanities end neatly explaining away observations far predominantly ""largely racism"" point narrative overshadows race specific biological aspects (e.g interferon polymorphisms found higher rate Black individuals, blood disorders found higher prevalance African ancestry, diabetes, vitamin etc)


Again, want clear- wish discourage effort wish downplay socioeconomic factors/access healthcare etc social science contributions general. Definately intention

Just concerned racism popular topic right hitting news pages daily, research might downplay biological components highlighting racism significant reason increased burden BAME communities would likely gain popularity quickly

 (I'm suggesting that's entirely hypothetical study would say, saying may implicit bias creating paper revolving around hypothesis focus conclusions coming non-virological non medical background general)

Unfortunately, understand first 657 times said unlikely understand now. US locked March, well increased testing April numbers. Look ameriburger thinking south Europe rain clouds publically traded company?  watch episode Ugly Delicious also? 😆 serious note, egg came first. Easier actual border go through... According google US rate deaths steady decline since May. saying things... spent 60 days home. got outside 6 times total walk dog, gloves mask. soon saw someone side street basically launch middle street (they empty anyway) avoid contact. mother went outside, gloves, mask strict social distancing inside shops buy needed.

The lock hard us, fear people forgot like see people street behave like nothing happened.

The numbers clearly good however moment, maybe I'm reacting based fear. hope proven wrong want old normality back. Community policing something like would fuckin nightmare. guys ever next door? Agnes across street left house since 90s gonna calling cops every POC passes neighborhood. one goes Hawaii for! skeptical data. It’s anecdote family friend admitted hospital kidney issue. tested covid came positive showing symptoms. classified covid hospitalization, though. lot people reddit want good news. want doom gloom, well ""future"" hope. Anything going good must dismissed. I’m sure head NIAID knows least little us. case section. Thanks, sure terminology! Sure, meanwhile remember time March Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland, UK spiralling control respective leaders took ages impose lockdown. Fucking pompous EU. False-asymptomatic cases people dont want guy went work despite symptoms?
 article guy went family gathering despite symptoms. that's happens admit symptoms...? would imagine lot ""asymptomatic"" ""presymptomatic"" cases, example meat packing plants would people want avoid repercussions gone work despite feeling 100%. know feed family paid sick leave would probably precisely that.

Could root paradoxical ""thousands asymptomatic"" case reports? NYC majority apartments owned either giant institutional investors individuals massive numbers units. even look “mom pop” landlords, often find people calling 5 10 buildings. story working class person saved saved buy three family house rent largely myth, increasingly time goes on. havent seen numbers cities, would shocked find one isnt case. Well, no. horses out. Many even, close barn doors we'd prevent getting out. 

Late action better action. ""In March"" along pretty reasonable assumptions seems suggest diagnosis suddenly stop April 1st. need testing. Testing testing.

Also, virus things wildly differently originally thought assumed ""new flu"".

Lastly, kind hard study long term effects before, know, long time passes. block US goods well. It’s way we’ll learn lesson. infection rates increasing here, potential US goods infected. way stays office cheating. he’s trying hardest. work short vacation? death family way people take anything seriously. It’s real actually happens them. That’s lot things life though, lot people won’t believe certain things haven’t personally seen it. queens power theoretical, even power all?

Thank you. stay healthy 🙏🏼 Indeed. believe seeing beginning end petrodollar.

That's true. There's reduced risk contraction wearing standard surgical mask regardless people around doing. much less wearing n95 mask better, provably there. mask still going collect significant fraction aerosolized water droplets intake. 

Even mostly free floating viral particles, noticeable fraction would get trapped cotton fibers contact directly. Even breathing straight pvc pipe; (very small) fraction would sticking walls, would accumulate higher concentrations exterior surface pipe.

Italian values peak (end March): 4,000 ICUs, 28,000 hospitals, 700-900 daily deaths, 82,000 self-isolation, around 6,000 new daily cases

**Today 06/23**: 19,573 currently active cases, 115 ICUs, 1,853 hospitals, 17,605 self-isolation mild symptoms without symptoms. 18 deaths (lowest number since beginning March), 122 new cases.

Since February: Total cases: 238,833, total deaths: 34,675, total recoveries: 184,585

Important note: think Italy one countries order declared recovered must test negative twice row, otherwise must remain self-isolation. US parameter ""recoveries"" applied (I think 2 weeks without symptoms) would lot less active cases. people took months eliminate virus. Although people thought contagious stop exhibiting symptoms Italy keeps playing safe.

To skeptics: serious lockdowns mandatory masks do. think economy recover fast citizens healthy.

The reporting issue quite bad tbh. One needs go directly UM's site get facts: order ""open"", country must less 20 infected people per year. 100,000 inhabitants per week.

Sweden pass threshold, thus border remain closed overall. However, special clause: special mechanism established Nordic countries. Nordic country meet objective criteria ""opening"", country switch regional scheme. case, opened entry regions country meet criterion number infected persons per year. week. Similarly, Ministry Foreign Affairs travel guides yellow orange open quarantine-affected regions still requirement 6-day accommodations tourists Denmark, unless resident Schleswig-Holstein Skåne, Halland Blekinge. one regions quarantined, still possible enter negative tests shown least 72 hours entry.

Only one region [Sweden, Vastabotten, currently meets criteria let's face people typically go Denmark vice . According currently available figures, Skåne, Halland Blekinge areas considered 'quarantined'. Therefore residents areas (which given extra special treatment due historical relationship borderlands) *in theory* enter get test. Sweden's testing bad extremely difficult get unless symptomatic renders border closed despite provision. basicall ymens test = entry people can't get tested unless symptomatic so: entry. now, anyway, unless SE fixes testing infrastructure. number infected persons must low level, **as well work formulate criterion countries' test regimes.**

There news means yet. somewhat likely, opinion, happen higher threshold Sweden at. Although Sweden improving terms testing, near level Denmark at. would put past DK set level quite high, hopes encourage Sweden get testing act together. 

I think politics, Danish government trying make Sweden feel bit better giving consolation prize (that really much terms open borders reality) trying push right direction. We'll see sure June 27 case turns be. far Fredericksen played intelligently hope they're going use cudgel try get Sweden shape up, fling borders open borderlands [where recently infection pressure worse Denmark including Correct, that's right trying say! argument comes gun control. guy somewhere machine shop make gun, sudden gun laws stupid worthless. can't even idiots.... people LA county travel - group friends go SLO County/Pismo Beach put final touches two upcoming nuptials. single mask among suggested always case, ample evidence horrible things he's said done. 13 year old niece knows ppl dying thing depressed able interact play friends. was/is constant struggle.

CNN barely mentioned continent today, article otherwise global aim: Great lets bring entire fucking NBA Well, UK probably bad as, say India… experience one person doesn’t account all. Many Vietnam vets ostracized disgraced came home fighting war never wanted part of. lot wasn’t present Iraq Afghanistan vets. 

Working conditions back 30-60s worse. fact. took formation unions establish safe health standards end child labor. white collar work, unpaid internships used commonplace whereas less frequent now. 

Also, kids access higher education ever. Kids go community college college university attend get degree afford/work towards. agree typical 4-year degree large university costs way much. kids still access affordable education. isn’t route want take. 

I never said race gender relations great today. You’d live rock think that. much worse acts committed minorities women back then. Women couldn’t divorce husband beat back single woman couldn’t much back even try raise kids own. grandmother back up. still hard, women divorce husbands live life. Racial violence reported way less back protected large amounts society. since changed continuing improve. 

Medicine health improved greatly. People living longer healthier lives. Back cancer diagnosis death sentence whereas something people manage, live with, cases fight off. Look technology helped fight Covid. Imagine virus happening 60s ONE could work home. 

Things improved. want to. please don’t compare anything grandparents live through. recommend talk someone grandfather. I'm (small portuguese island) Government says ppl arrive (from plane) bring negative test result, going sent quarantine hotel 2 weeks come 2 weeks pass. currently positive cases they're ppl arrived island test done. get tested hotel stay 2 weeks.

It's going pretty good us far. Nobody could known! drank quarter pre Covid19. Since March, I've drink twice, hated it. drinking, instead dumping out, h beers use cooking though, radical increase me. radical increase cannabis consumption though. 

I'm extrovert nature though, time *very* challenging personally. introverted son wife time lives though. also telling people wear mask don’t anything Fauci lying everyone? 

I’m struggling anything I’ve wearing one since March I’m willing bet Americans take insult rather Europe taking safety precautions surely hope follows it. Good riddance bad rubbish.  
Rubbish bad gnoll touch another gnoll's two tined garden fork.   
Nobby might pinch laid-out drunk's small change, sprinkle slab slice. Outside making fun media rally Trump never claimed told anyone slow testing.

But keep spreading lies No, asking people follow basic precautions—like wearing masks, staying 6 ft away anyone part household, social activities outside—that public health info supports *that currently actually working significantly limit spread NYC, Europe, many places.* Yes, people die regardless, huge grey area hiding homes there’s vaccine whatever hell want without even wearing fucking mask. rocket science. Checking states webpage stats seeing numbers go every day like like🙃 shortage Zoloft CDC noting significant portion total increased mortality accounted Covid count suicides drug overdoses although won’t know numbers year due collected.

Calls federal mental health crisis lines went 1,000 pct, alcohol consumption 55 percent, many drug rehabs shut down... wouldn’t surprised rise deaths panic despair shutdowns social isolation won’t take collective lifespan virus itself. countries too, Sweden done still , Australia it..... Germany Belgium closed borders travelers necessary allowed go through, yet problem entering country, allowed travel through, forced pay 2 times 5 euro allowed use tunnel (which way go need swim🙃)
Not tunnel made free time closed borders, continued cash bastards! Oh boy, “mobs rioters looters” take.

You’re angry person, aren’t you? said point trying say covid-19 big deal?

why fuck think China countries shut trying hard keep disease out. Dumbass.  Wow, took forever understand 87% number came from.

If you’re arguing virus mutate existence you’re wrong. R0 virus unchecked way high mortality rate low enough virus selective pressures. 

I may wrong unless back first assertion peer reviewed source don’t believe word argument.

Edit: Sweden literally banking herd immunity meaning 50+% population would need infected. argument basis reality. shows detached reality stock market is. 2 3/4 Please point said 3,000 last 24 hours. I’ll patiently wait.

I said Florida 10 times cases yesterday Italy:

Florida - 2,926
Italy - 221

Am still wrong? seems like really want wrong. ****raises eyebrow**** quiet white kid wears trenchcoats picked dictator... Give time. Things could whole lot different end year. Currently, may pent demand, urban flight, riots all. going say same. least I’m at, people drinking way more. They’re home instead bars totally get telling us books countries success, China, australia, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But arent already weeds this? Leadership US abysmal. many states given (AZ, FL) going ruin others trying right (NY).

&amp;#x200B;

I dont see tracing would help point. endgame hoping herd immunity vaccine. That's reassuring, aware elderly homes bit information. thank you, will. mostly people interacting much actually others' space extended periods time (a lot public health departments using 10-15 minutes exposure rule thumb counts ""contact"").

Hm, thinking NYC rush hour, could easily crammed people—standing body body practically face face—for half hour longer, depending far commute work.

Hopefully NYC keeps mask usage! it. already saw impact haphazardly handling pandemic arrived, dont hesitate time New York. Totally true, nonzero number people would self-enforce, means non-zero number people would safer policy. could even argue that's appropriate balance resources would take even attempt enforce policy well risk mis-enforcement also real costs. Careful, get shit point thing anything less death sentence every living thing planet.  HIV completely different virus properties make really hard develop vaccine (remember, one gain natural immunity HIV, unlike majority viruses). Malaria causes virus plasmodium (a unicellular eukaryote), and, again, infected grant one immunity (although catch malaria soon symptoms milder).

P.S.

The first plague vaccine developed three month, however nowadays drug allowed market without extensive testing ensure absence adverse side-effects (on hand, plague - 50% mortality rate best case - almost side-effect better that). literally said repeated Monday.He walked back today. Which, know, Fox article said. think influence, think NBA orlando return lot too. tried back april, backtrack. surprise one, admin testing start bc dont like bad PR case numbers insane is... ended working test start crisis, bc admin wanted one able test hence control testing stats. 

Cant believe anyone continues defend happening. literally think ignore virus hope best. Swedes also STRONGLY ADVISED TRAVEL, point? Nah, we'll take wall NY keeping virus new England continue crushing it. let delivery trucks thru. Sounds like really gonna rush one out. Kinda scary.  that’s case wouldn’t much automatic weapon attacks? don’t happen meaning black market isn’t them. even owning one without proper paperwork illegal. ashamed indeed, dynamism might positive upturn amid chaos !

lets hope there's good outcome ! Thank god. look restaurant reason customers wearing masks it’s COVID free zone insanity even get walking pneumonia diagnosed don’t symptoms? listen him?

Because he's Colorado_blue. HIV mutates rapidly vaccine likely possible. true coronaviruses.

Yes, vaccine candidates fail. However, working 150 once. odds failing high. mean flight would biggest risk. Rest trip would distanced. Don’t worry aren’t going. Finally gets let us know what's Orange Toddler grabbing mic away. right, forcing confirmed virus carriers integrate vulnerable population earth right idea. idea great too. Keep drinking kool aid. Disney minimal lines?

I'm game Arkansas. testing 100% employees meat processing facilities outbreaks seeing nationwide industry.

They took standard tests, antibody tests. active infection (and likely infecting others) without symptoms. found similar numbers tested entire prison populations state. Yeah. coronavirus, happens even faster! Intelligent Americans trying travel. Because, well, us epidemic play kills people.

I'm good travel ban country. Sounds like bozo It’s new type technology uses different method vaccination others. vaccines grant temporary immunity, one looks like grant permanent immunity know....money walks. Oh trust me, are. Don’t sorry. brought upon ourselves. Trump made things much worse, even competent president, people would’ve gotten bored started acting irrationally point. would turned shit show matter what. expecting visitors shit hole stupid? can't even enforce masks public. joke. we're fucked. We're quarantining everyone, though rest Europe probably become exception next week right many people world fucking Stay home couple months. ww2 people horrible 6 years even stay 6 months home, ridiculous.  19 percent really reassuring. That's statewide mean, like COVID, positivity also clusters. areas might getting Queens NY rates now. done deal: curve takes course. 

I'm glad medical personnel plenty PPE up-to-date latest treatments, medications supplies need. do--don't they????? Texas: Don’t mess Texas

COVID-19: challenge? I’m gonna take that

Texas: Shit read article claim, points story changed Monday Tuesday. _The article explicitly calls changed story_. 

Inconsistency isn’t result bad reporting, person reported keeps making shit day day. 

But know, hurr durr CNN guess “lol”. Could’ve false test first time, no? honest read whole comment, read first sentence assumed rest saying really worth reading... wasting 30 seconds reading ""the meat"" statement seems like assumption pretty spot on.

Anyway, assuming NYPD cancelled defunded time im finished writing sentence, im sure happy take task tracking/fining/arresting people break quarantine rules... doubt they'll bang job, mean could possibly go wrong? like police power-abusing racists...so lets put charge enforcing quarantine (until next week cancelled bastards) randomly naming cities. cities hit wave mean protests LA effect. Pennsylvania NYC seem pretty good job relatively low number new cases added daily - meaning potentially much better position protests places like LA, Texas, etc... 

Saying wave affected protests mean causes.. 6k new cases day CA pretty awful, 1/3rd LA alone. think so, would much massive level. see possibility housing costs decrease pandemic continues, after. rent cost buy house. interesting

so survivors previous coronaviruses better chance fighting COVID-19 know place since schlurp Cuomo 24/7. Okay? Living country doesnt mean cant protect individually. Around mid-March, finally getting public's attention, saw cheap flight Paris September. almost jumped it, thinking kid would back school, pandemic would least fairly controlled then, right?

But saw ""Har har, hoax"" FB posts fellow Americans thought better it. Glad waste money, sad nation come this. I’m saying all. I’m indicating everywhere look country disaster real difficult environment incumbent in, regardless party. Barely anyone Australia New Zealand wore masks. saying. Seating limited available seats. want rude, holy shit attending physical church? Like inside pews?

Is alternative, like livestream sessions available? seems uniquely dangerous lot church goers (where am, Georgia) tend towards senior age. seems pretty large weekend effect reported numbers new cases deaths, wouldn’t surprised fewer people went get tests therefore slight preference testing people Covid. wouldn’t compare weekend weekday, look 7-day averages instead. maybe enough wake call get legislators actually something.

With Trump charge, nothing's going change. Shit's going get bad. Opening fine, could trusted devolve instantly.. unfortunately happening. police request cell phone tower information suspect crime committed help prove not?

The crime suspect people committing potential quarantine breach. Done! still conspiracy according some. would say Russian trolls, people small community near Austin buying hoax narrative they've luxury hit home. Blame trump making mask political tool pandemic. Yep. Deaths hospitalizations known nearly accounted for. known many get total, agree number far higher official stats - thus risks far lower. necessarily nice way grab money even ticket 1% people wear mask consensus medical professionals say wearing mask reduces COVID exposure. 

I’m sorry you’re struggling much. Alternatively, maybe wish speedy recovery. No, means without symptoms. asymptomatic still test positive transmit covid. problem state finding cases testing 100% employees work places.

He really likes probably liked drag son barber even I'll probably hook least another round cuts even though seems like wearing mask makes safe enough go get done barber point.

At least got new skill this, guess. haircuts clippers paid themselves, too. Covid-19 turned passable teacher's assistant hair stylist. wish getting paid it, ohoho. Must **egregious** set example. 

It’s like **is** threshold stupid anyway? Literally means nothing Goodbye grandma? wearing mask nose mouth every time indoor public space can't socially distance 80% job.

The answer ""how survived"" ""poorly, without proper treatment, went pass along trauma future generations.""

There's actually quite bit research badly fucked Western society failing properly help people trauma world wars. particular paper line discussion section every one way, shape, form: ""One major limitation evidence concerning actual prevalence mask-wearing public unavailable countries.""

The data even measuring mask usage dogshit, often relies self-reporting, difficult, impossible, isolate away hygiene related items. That's endemic problem research mask efficacy, almost never brought up. very, best data mask usage going problem people saying wore mask better often actually due pressure expectations! unexplainable. company gain employees get sick can't work? joke found I’ve spending less money I’m cooking home etc. know that’s case everyone. don’t think it’s bad thing allow people income save either way.

Cash cheap right now, financially stable get rates like 2.99% True that, guess know sure maybe even years. Tired ""definitive"" information gets changed pretty quickly. decision earmark pandemic history books Wow, nearly 400 people ventilators AZ 😟 Deaths number ever cared about.

I care many asymptomatic people it. people dying handled well simple:

My freedom important fear. 

To put clearly. Czech. worn months time go home car. wanted, made mandatory. Disliked fuck, glad get rid finally week.

They obnoxious, inconvenient, another thing keep mind on, wearing gets uncomfortable hell actually move and/or temps rise. honestly, really kind person actively seek discomfort inconveniences, enjoy them. Actually opposite, try avoid those.

And yes know help, certain special circumstances. come on, 0.09% IFR fro whole 0-69yrs group...

The biggest issue? vividly absolutely hate, despise oppose someone tells forces this, dont that, wear this, dont wear that. well remember shitshow wore KISS t-shirt school back days. 13 anymore somebody tell supposed dress myself. Keep mind tho, doesnt cover issue private property house rules. shop establishment demands wear facemask, comply go somewhere else. Free choice still stands.

Sure ask wear one. civil manner. right consider request comply similar civil manner refuse, decide want to. Simple that.

Hate much want. honest confession someone wear facemasks really thrilled them. Pass law allows quarantine police spot checks hotels motels.

Cop shows hotel asks see registry guests use state licenses register. Go room knock. answer issue ticket using info used register hotel.

This would possibly reduce good amount state traffic. So? statement meaningless. people wouldn’t even understood full risk. 

Look country now, good 6 months on. That’s matters. Link? don’t see it. Hardly anyone wears mask public. you’re treated like pariah red shirters want mock fight wearing one. Talking Points Memo legitimate, albeit left-leaning news source.

[Here alternate source regarding feds ending Dallas' testing scroll ""Federal support Dallas testing stop end month"". American seconding this: need reap sowed here, want travel (like me, desperately) need take public no-mask shaming new level. countries suffer us.

Spain may accept uk tourists, problems attracting tourists safer places. states figured wear masks social distance now, things would different. suck it. run along learn that, come back.

You mean states governors mayors telling people go restaurants bars support local business? Like New York? I’d like believe Fauci wasn’t one charge call. feels political anything else, either way it’s absolute disgrace thank giving freedumbs crowd fuel fire still living one safest times human history. Covid-19 won’t even close effect lifespan obesity. average age death someone covid-19 older average age death someone obesity. Almost half us obese, covid-19 kills .5 percent get it.

There huge host things represent larger threats average lifespan Covid-19. Can't speak California TX absolutely be. Wow stupid point teach kids Another recent study claimed 70% 65 reported symptoms. seems indicate group looking hard enough symptoms. makes sense health care workers would better spotting mild symptoms. Stay indoors then. Nobody asking go outside. Ok I'm sure voicing opinion make people think right-wing apologist (very far political leaning), black Hispanic people US tend disproportionately overweight compared ethnic groups, huge risk factor.

76.1% black people overweight obese compared 69.8% white people. Also 14.6% black people smoke cigarettes compared average 13.7% US.

Is disparity quality care races? Probably - going serious non-knee jerk conversation discuss risk factors make covid deadly. yet Florida still wants people New York quarantine two weeks. make sense way around now! part based recent, any, coronavirus infections patient had.

Our grandfathers stormed beaches Normandy facing certain death. Definition per capita: ""The per capita amount of something the total amount country area divided by number people country area."" GB, country EU hit worst (I still count part EU point time...)
Total deaths due covid: approx 43k
Population: approx 60,4 million
I.e. per capita deaths due covid = 43000/60400000 = 0,000712 = 0,0712% 

Same US: 
Deaths: 123k
Population: 328 million
Deaths per capita= 123000/328000000 = 0,000375 = 0,0375%

So country EU hit worst double deaths per capita compared US moment, still somehow argument you. Nevertheless numbers clearly show nowhere near 10%. Sweet tits? Nice.

Except touching balls, sweat shit over. Since obviously haven’t paying attention, already sites built already built producing vaccine even doesn’t work didn't. Absolute ignorant comment. 20 year olds underlying health issues. virus attacks people differently, also depends much virus exposed to. People 20s dying this. it’s ignorant say ‘20 year olds aren’t really getting sick.’ instead declare dumb-ass non-essential? small sample, actually lot sources correlation sure someone came vaccine listed risks associated smoking one would willing take it. live close border Utah Colorado. live rural town can’t get everything local grocery often travel Utah go Walmart. early May going grocery pick soon crossed border got alert phone Utah telling go website tell I’m doing, I’m going long I’m staying. tried give information website didn’t work, couldn’t submit destination. Utah since (only grocery pick up) happen again. little scary also pretty cool. Privileges Immunities Clause US constitution enables free movement states. can't grab people up. bluster Abbot saying bluster Cuomo saying it.

It limited cases disease though. [There’s Supreme Court case decades 14th amendment adopted, reaffirming states establish blanket quarantine preventing people coming state, even interstate international travel normally wouldn’t allowed touch.

EDIT: said, NY might change laws allow - governor might authority current laws, said, plus would immediately go court challenge Hawaii Maine states facing. egoist

That's word would use. without mask? Yes we're aware hindsight 20/20 fuck now? Trump banned flights ChYna Opening early social behavior modification plan: masks, walk/sanitize hands, social distancing. opened virus magically disappeared. well happened Delaware wanted turn away New Yorkers, think that’s little bit extreme asking people quarantine 14 days. ideas sound good paper doesn’t work regardless. Culturally, upper Nordic peoples refer Danes ""the Italians Nordics"" Danes relatively gregarious outgoing, like hug upon greeting example MUCH rare Nordics. also LOVE party/go nightclubs, bars, restaurants imo closed soon enough. Danes super fun (not danes ofc, overall) probably part bit ass.

According to..? anyone lives CV hot zone states able comment mask culture/acceptance/usage month ago now?

I live NYC, probably epicenter pandemic. VAST majority people wear masks, even they’re walking street completely alone. Mask usage enforced stores- don’t mask don’t get shop. 

I feel safe fellow New Yorkers. However, still people don’t wear masks, small percentage. anecdotal, course. That's meant listening experts cat bag last weeks. may right week. think also seems people infectious right onset peak symptoms. why, aside PPE use, people get infected community rather hospitals. entire platform anxiety covid side effect, person's reaction it. 

Never minimized anxiety. boy trigger bunch people want rewrite side effect actually is.  much hurts say, really needs put us back shelter-in-place order. opened entirely soon. Florida alone 5 million residents Netherlands. world's notorious supervillain! Florida Man! sounds like arguments situation Sweden worse countries. May is, imply things becoming worse Sweden before. Can’t take it? None said applies idea mean lmao. Sorry that!
Honestly Buddy I’m really sure problem ain’t ain’t Canada! really hope whatever that’s bothering gets better one coming poorly you. UK had one worst infection mortality rates world. That's one way looking it.

The way looking disease affected 0.45% led deaths 0.06% UK population. 

Covid dangerous, *that* dangerous. get vaccines comes right? read article? saying virus causes brain damage, saying brain damage stroke makes virus worse.  that's anyone saying refuse accept that. big deal one would calling quarantine. still real problem concerned about.

there reason suffering, see good done. want everyone suffer did, see suffering worthy sacrifice, want refusal hard work undo ours. hasn’t given trying. Good him. Andy Roddick good routine Djokovic way back when. Oh shit think dentists office spent shit ton money rework HVAC safely see multiple patients once. sent everyone long note even included diagrams did. Kinda cool Your* hospitals fine. I’m private practice anyways girl hospital employed nurse. She’s got hours cut significantly No, people suffering result election results. people chose leaders, reap benefits, good bad. DeSantis tv right saying mostly younger people problem. part plan also fault listening great leadership time. wonder long admit he's complete fuck up. think good sign cases shown yet, least one expert makes convincing argument 6 weeks threshold knowing sure: I've learned anything sub I'm better blind catching covid-19. ship sailed. San Diego similar plan private hospitals agreed work together balance patient loads - Kaiser, Sharp, Scripps, Rady Children’s... don’t want need use least it’s already established. mean yeah, super true. think it’s argument schools need remain online. open back 100%, numbers jump even more. 

I’m fan soft lockdown, don’t think many folks country interested sadly. pointed local restaurant owner commented mutual friend's page, replied old dumbass comment: ""I live fear, even kills me"". two months ago toilet broke apartment. Rather risk apartment maintenance men saw walking around without mask went stayed sister recently gotten COVID Test come back negative. returned apartment next day 3 hours left best bleach bathroom doorknobs light switches.

Five days later returning apartment developed sore throat, moderate dry cough, pain chest (cold burning sensation), difficulty breathing. Felt like trying breath wide straw. Dr. Demand Visit told get Covid Test. manage get one throat swab though suppose nasal swab. pushed continued work (from home.) times would episodes panicking laboring breath would wrap outside blanket breath deeply patio (3rd floor apartment) 60 90 minutes subsided. never ran fever. checked constantly. Also Galaxy Note 9 kept track O2 levels lowest dropped 92%, idea dropped 90% going hospital. 5 days results came negative ever continued kick ass least another week half.

**What's chances Covid Test false negative?** I'm finally feeling better getting sick second time (unconfirmed sinus infection) I'm thinking getting antibody test I'm better, moral obligation go donate plasma help. know Ulcerative Colitis, auto-immune disease though would make COVID kill me. anyone actionable information would greatly appreciate it. I'm trolling ask this, I'm legit curious but...are really talking true here? really Oxford vax trial? necessary. enforce mask requirements. can’t prevent transmission, control masks Hey asshole. put nursing homes since you’re good that? Oh god, guy still showing face big anti-lockdown article speculated maybe might 10,000 cases US? wonder much would really help. area 75% cases asymptomatic. let run loose 3 days hotel, might end making worse false sense security. teens access video calling software large selection apps.

I don’t care behavior court, highly irresponsible endangered lives people. That's racist! something..

Sweden alone Europe chose path international European recommendations.

Could cite I've never seen many outright lies

Why believe lies? Ok, let flag mask mandatory Random thought: Fauci seems like good dude. type guy could beer listen stories. bad saddled system f'd hard make difference. agree sentiment, also think likely sliding scale type situation. I'm guessing one three number hospitalized patients ones severe lasting damage, surprise similar number patients get bad whatever reason still lasting damage, mild enough see doctor over, rationalized away number ways. would hard time believing there's damage unless sick enough go hospital. planning follow rules? mandated out-of-state travelers coming Maine, well Maine residents returning Maine, complete 14-day quarantine upon arrival. * need arrive enough food 14 days arrange food delivered you. cannot go grocery * Stay home. cannot go public * Avoid contact others, especially high risk severe COVID-19 State allow adults obtain receive negative COVID-19 PCR test 72 hours arriving Maine forgo 14-day quarantine upon arrival Maine. Maine strongly urging visitors “Know Go,” meaning get tested receive test results home state traveling Maine, allow take appropriate action depending result. test result time arrive, must quarantine lodging receive result. Individuals may tested upon arrival Maine well, must quarantine awaiting results. meanwhile OC Karens frothing mouths yelling ‘no masks’ Okay, I’ll come level. Anxiety, severe, something “can worked through” 

It’s choice. People can’t control it. *neurological disorder* research spout stupid bullshit like know anything about. lol jk jk hf Early measures. big cluster coming Austria caused spike, lead closures schools workplaces. Limitations public transportation cancellation events also implemented. Furthermore, (anectdotal) businesses decided early take minor measures, regulations.

Not really strict, early, Prime Minister even admitted so. Still strict compared Sweden however.

I’m looking forward reading years time, imagine surprising correlations things like air circulation contagion. may early attribute kind success anything yet. deaths plummeting even overall cases relatively constant since early May. deaths going materialize? Californian here, idea white-collar company going back office. Yet, WeWork company gave lease acting like everything fine.

There zero value going back office, real risk you’ll knock half team sick leave. actually happened NY. upstate NY cluster exposure couple months ago. exposed quarantined hotel three weeks. Second Elder Millenial here...also USA. low dose anti-depressant boat you, friend. added insomnia flavor. Never issues before. It’s real eye opening experience. 

If didn’t insurance access mental health care...it probably would quickly spiraled. feel aren’t fortunate. 

So glad reaching help less stigmatized today, work still needs done area too. New cases less 3,000 last 24 hours.... wonder though, what's plan long term AU NZ? Great - excellent job containing it... what? Close airports wait vaccine used entire planet?

In Melbourne reopened, 23 new cases short order, shut everything again. NZ, allowed grieving family members in, lo 2 covid, ended allowance.

But what? USA/Brazil/UK basically even trying contain it. keep exporting month/YEARS. Seems unwinnable me. state? got tested California. made appointment Thurs today whole thing took around 15 minutes got there. Protecting sufficient, defending infection is...

Unless mean something else ""defending infection"" then...

One works other. dont let virus particles get system. achieve wearing protective gear. works. absolutely necessary community's cooperation wear gear prevent getting me? dont believe talking individuals too.

As part collective effort sufficient, defending infection always community effort.

Where else mention individuals?

 remind whole thread started someone saying individually would eventually get it. So, topic countries must stop individuals avoid it. topic thread really avoid individually, *despite* country unwilling (a relevant topic America). original comment, 'we gonna get anyway' 2 months most. days already getting shorter, temperatures start dropping within month. likely take another month 2 factors moved enough show significant change. weather already turn us, change exponential due daylight changes temperature change lags behind that. respectful intelligent Americans confined months trying leave place?

But yes, countries shouldn’t open US leadership gets shit together (which wont happen)  Lol...

Seriously guys read President made comment, multiple White House officials asserted President Trump different story, telling reporter **though never gave order slow testing**, really tell people United States would look better fewer coronavirus tests performed.

Trump always said testing makes us look bad find cases, outside making fun media claiming said slow testing, Trump never said suggested told anyone slow testing.

But keep pushing misinformation hoping people read headlines Well since temperature screening theatrics anyway, matter. Asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread confirmed fact. believe latest animal studies, fecal spread infectious virus. using bathroom church. yeah, going help people much. better nothing help people. looked it, lost job month ago, payment option would steered towards would paying back owe year. basically 50% increase mortgage year. Yeah rules state also clear should. unfortunately businesses reading ""if open office will."" Yep. Also vulnerable populations impacted disproportionately early (like nursing homes) still inflated rate normalizes. Yeah guess that's way look it. lmao filter keeps getting bigger bigger. 2021 unable post anything except positive platitudes Ramdev charlatan. You’re talking total numbers since pandemic started thread discussing new cases last 24 hours. fact true doesn’t mean it’s remotely relevant. lmao Where? can't find data zip code me, it’s probably Scandinavian heritage. problem might ""benevolent"" matter opinion. Dictator could acting entirely good faith still disagree people. could intention beginning, miss important changes people's minds and/or able work ousted. Stay home ? happened economy ? bot? syntax place. Good you, EU. bunch dumbasses Mask Stay Safe. let us infect again. long take see works??? Asymptomatic? socially distanced? would anyone want go lots people right now? Seems bizarre one would go Right? frustrating watching everyone bounce dick. That's B.C. leaders deferred expertise provincial health officer. 180~ cases holding relatively steady. implying preventing people dying reason important nail salon staying open OKC metro policemen's favorite Asian Massage Parlor's profit margins?? Really...... **true** Okie, get priorities line ""Jesus"" ""Conservative"" things life. Takk. really need get more. not? reading I'm posting. resorted insults false allegations. What? No. Lmao far goalposts shifted though. real goal is, always been, containment suppression. goal never create “Georgias,” create “Michigans.” Let’s delude thinking we’ve successful could conceivably done worse. wonder is, bizarre.  can’t believe get pick either complete moron Biden honestly senile. wrong USA Ahh sorry reread statment, FL 3,000 positive tests yesterday. dumb. Imagine stupid 2020 😭

Thanks laugh Yeah, that's I'm questioning I've never heard they're sourcing anything / anyone. seems like rumor tremendous haven’t I’m saying it’s easy, I’ve seen lines people trying. yeah, rarely ever see tennis news subs Reddit. actually ready comment randomly pick one reply to? really seems like read first sentence responded that, ignoring meat statement.  Well, would argue a) zero evidence Trump actually wealthy prior election, b) many articles Russia bailing Trump bankruptcy. There’s also articles Trump Jr. talking important business partner Russia them. It’s guess work won’t release taxes, I’d argue probably owes lot money. Plus wealthy people always fight power, definitely received. finally, tweets seem follow formula. Step 1) throw idea crazy people laugh him, still introduce idea. Say he’s kidding. Step 2) catastrophe warrants it. Step 3) push action, position right along. opposition never acts step 1 laugh he’s stupid, can’t act step 2 they’re putting fires, step 3 it’s late. He’s speed law (because is) opposition still gathering evidence.

Now America deserve it? Absolutely. We’ve skit Middle East years, perfecting it. Also billionaires don’t care countries, care preserving wealth. There’s really way know Trump simply puppet actually intelligent, think agree presidency highly effective (for Russia). people, nature work circumstances, get regularly tested, symptoms need too, generally sick, locked down, risk others there's little reason tested. I'll different get tests home.That game changer. dream scenario would allow us test leaving house make sure we're putting others risk test get back make sure catch outside. tests claim able catch infections day exposed, tests say work like pregnancy tests we're getting closer hope. Dad? Oh great... many karens going demand speak manager europe this.

Happy germany things come back time - existed reason, exist again. Worse case scenario, figure live regular COVID-19 infection. another flu. It'll take us years get there, possibly horrific number deaths, eventually, will. 

You'd better thinking make institutions, return, better meeting needs created for. 

Also... dude, put quarantine hot second try use passport now. know that, right? That's China comes play. know, laughed kids dying peanut allergies, start talking global pandemic, that’s line won’t cross?? Yes remember mortality rates static. tend decrease time medical personnel get better treating disease, demography patients shifts less vulnerable people. Live East Bay took trip Sac last week pick something up. 3 businesses went mask restrictions customers staff everyone took advantage it. Felt place mask on, got business done promptly left. Stark contrast SF bay area. think reasoning there's rise anti-vax movement recent years. seen enough kids measles polio threat ""real"". shame people suffer order others comprehend reality. poignant statement fact states increasing testing, **the number tests coming back positive least four states averaging **double-digit rates percentage tests positive** virus: Arizona **20%**, Florida Utah **11%**, Texas **10%**. contrast, New York, formerly epicenter U.S. outbreak, reporting positive test rates around **The World Health Organization considers positivity rates 5% especially concerning**.

.

Anyone regurgitating nonsense 'more tests cases' needs pull head look *percentage tests positive*.

Yes testing occurring, revealing outbreak US getting worse. CARES Act include forbearance

if actually work, foreberance probably isnt going help much going pay back term over. flexibility payment terms people going swimming cash 6 months. Testing positive Covid means NOTHING.

At point time flu season people test positive various strains flu, Covid. Reporting positive case (some false) serves instill fear. 

The point remains Covid 99% survival rate MATTER many positives get registered.

Jesus Christ b.s ... Yes, 8.7m+another 14m estimate(april-may- half june)+2.4 confirmed. 123k now, that's based saying 25m total had.

Fauci probably regrets compromised allowing matter short-term distributive justice public safety override obligation, Kantian terms, tell truth.

""The long run"" test deeds, long run showing would better simply told truth. ways get masks, needed, right hands. That's sovereign authority emergency powers. failed there, fault case. now, Fauci shares blame.

That said, man superhuman turn dog's breakfast Washington politics nourishing acceptable diner brunch serve American people. lucky knowledge, wisdom. people state fleeing NYC spread everywhere first place? take protective measures medical supplies groceries. Wont get dont let happen. wear protective gear wash afterwards soap. Everything can. works. people survive WWII can't survive staying home months playing videogames watching Netflix? Death rate? 3.4% initially China, always thought around .75-1.25% things read time. .5-.7% best have. 17.4% today smh UK, Italy, France , Spain Belgium allowed travel? Bc way higher deaths per capita way worse mortally rates per case-sounds like pretty big failures commented pandemic people needed still take seriously. Heads NYC week later.

Yes, everyone ELSE needs take seriously continue usual. fuck supposed enforce invoking martial law? whole country joke, enforcing quarantine, people without masks, president actually fighting wide spread testing political gain. can’t make shit think ""standing US"" means then? coughing hand touching ball? company used work for, less 1% users responsible generating 100% revenue. But, social media website freemium model.

Also used work cellphone app company thing happened.

I making everyone else slowed really poor comparison. 

WW2 identifiable enemy, coronavirus visible naked eye.

WW2 killing maiming hundreds thousands people bringing even fold, know one person gotten rona asymptomatic.

Working production lines serving military feels like action provides sense camaraderie, staying cooped home unemployed doesn't. nuggets secret weapon season restarts burning building Florida. Jokic immune fire, may nugget able play finals. I'm really curious think replying too. Nah china, america. definitely said would 250k deaths june. projections total shit get go drug companies want clout first one vaccine. amost mistread Nikola Tesla! Texas! boosting healthcare capacity one reason lockdown. also giving companies time increase production availability PPE hand sanitizer, also giving scientists time learn new virus spreads, also giving doctors time develop treatments protocols improve outcomes patients catch it, also slowing limiting spread virus protect everyone including vulnerable. 

The lockdown social distancing viral outbreak control 101. seen numbers UK recently might able reopen safely now, smart cautious there's still much understand virus spreads. 

As school issue that's extremely complicated. Schools breeding ground disease best circumstances. risk children low, children bringing virus back homes day care centers. There's still lot understood new inflammatory syndrome kids getting too.  

I'm sure places get kids back school safely, understand hesitation given fact ability teach remotely. Honestly, even every child took gap year going kill them. see great need rush things. Sorry Gavin, I've told ""we're absolutely going shutdowns again"" here. Apparently Reddit knows better governors. agreeing Everyone’s immune system reacts differently exposed virus. Someone strong, healthy immune system exposed virus may become infected, may become infected show symptoms. compromised immune systems elderly considered higher risk dying doctors suggested Trudeau may already coronavirus symptoms. Trudeau tested virus, doctors recommend testing people Camilla’s case, Dr. Fish said it’s possible proper hygiene could’ve played role negative test results. However, added it’s entirely possible Camilla could test positive later.

I think we're disagreeing semantics.

From certain cases, infectious diseases may asymptomatic much even course given host. latter case, disease may defined ""disease"" (which definition means illness) hosts secondarily become ill contact asymptomatic carrier. **An infection synonymous infectious disease, infections cause illness host.** [17]

As said, infection = virus entered system minimum viable amount. Developing symptoms depends system interacts virus. Hey now, try mess narrative. clear, even rate means million Americans die reach herd immunity.  Also kind topic wish they'd stop trying ban political posts altogether. point hard discuss US reaction COVID-19 without pointing condemning certain persons groups responsible. Terrible comparison...and think know bad comparison want push agenda.

So fine ""open country"" whatever called protests, right? Speak yourself. riding high unemployment stimulus! play supplemental oxygen strapped backs California 6k cases yesterday.

Even killed men lead plot timeline unlikely someone else would gotten bright idea stab man spent career ignoring democratic consensus exploiting loopholes republic. conclusions accurate. think them, mean true. 
You aware shook opponents' hands match? Highly educated population. reopen crew volunteer You’re kind dick, huh. Lol. much coward even leave original statement. 

Yup. Conservative. happens weak leadership. COVID going massively spread folks didn’t head warnings. 

Even refusing basic hygiene like wear mask putting lives danger. I've noticed opposite California. Masks make people feel invincible. wear walking quiet, residential areas always sure give well 6 feet distance personal opinion better. No, no, no. Don’t worry it’s totally cool. virus magically go away heat.

/s Politics aside, Fauci broke Hippocratic oath 100%, regardless whether order handed down. intentionally misled public ethical duty otherwise arguably demonstrated gross negligence actions. in-person teaching yourself? Dr acknowledges existence $300
Tylenol $40 There's volcano waking Iceland fact matter regular daily activities -- like going bars restaurants indoors -- likely involve vastly larger numbers people time, opposed short-lived peak protests largely seem died down.

So looking make real impact cases, saying ""don't protest"" kind like saying ""stop attending Christmas celebrations"" two weeks New Years Day. Lol think going happen opened made mask wearing optional...........oh yeah supposed magically disappear like miracle.

Oops read officials health officials..... don’t think much say reopening part still one surprised this. Canada we've provincial borders closed months. RCMP stationed every highway crossing provincial lines, massive fines caught sneaking through. starting lift restrictions specific provinces extremely low case counts. read symptom.  reality Florida functionally bankrupt State another extended depression. state corporate income tax, without sales lodging taxes, State able fund another bi-annual budget past maybe something like 50% expected revenues.

There entire chain reaction businesses rely Disney World major tourist destinations open, employ huge percentage State.

And simply cannot functioning US economy growth mode without tourism travel sector least stable.

The economic pressures justify anything, reality Florida re-open, matter many people die. surely Governor others reacting to.

EDIT: I'm saying right, reality. even matter, State likely going major government meltdown, hundreds thousands cut backs, teacher layoffs, property tax increases, etc. State safety net speak of, survives huge infusions cash people travelling State countries around US. International travel basically zero.

Universal Studios reopened weeks, instead running 90-100% capacity normal time year, looking capacity probably around 20%. Disney cancelled fall special events, Universal may cancel next. People travel Florida en masse safe, feel safe RN. dude, put quarantine hot second try use passport now. know that, right?

Depends country! course, would problem spending two weeks working home -- leaving food medicine -- meant spending many months years normal country without shuttered businesses, masks, distrust. Please forget Florida fine locked NY everyone came that's cases started grow Florida could become something reality. overwhelmed doctors may start black tagging folks. saving 1 dude car accident could mean x number patients die, let pass. people politicizing wearing masks don’t even active passport. nicest vacation they’ve cousin’s double wide Florida. tennis match outbreak also included party nightclub I’m mistaken. Yea i'm shocked low figured it'd much higher. guess may go show danger lessen outdoors.

EDIT: OH WAIT MASS - Half testing self testing lol Orange County. I've thought emigrating Netherlands. wonderful country love cycling culture. course, would learn Dutch! flex, state great Biden, gotta start talking this. bought hand sanitizer I’m sure it’s actually effective covid, anyone confirm? Brand All-clean Natural Hand Sanitizer ingredients has: purified water, glycerin, lemongrass, mint essential oils also states 70% ethyl alcohol Disney parks capacity limits, there's going crowd that's usually there. alcohol sanitisers de-natured ever travel world see countries residents living? damn glad get home. due fly Florida Spain tomorrow 4 week vacation. Sad coming, honestly, seen situation there, US fucked currently. Lot's Paris, notice freedom americain shorts ;) Probably goldilocks principle here. little response? Lots viral replication disease. much? Cytokine storm, immune cells attack you.

The immune system INSANELY complex. reality dont really know, quite yet, underlies differential disease course.

Recent studies implicated blood antigens potentially predisposing factors severe infection, loci simply correlated severe disease, proven causal factor. prices room service? know US hotel room service prices substantially marked compared found elsewhere? gouging there, too? Given easy testing quarantine going become, suspect morph series hoops jump (at cost, essentially) move countries. 

A quarantine layover Iceland, seems unafraid handling incoming risky travelers, would likely starting point. don’t even know would want go right “have fun.” could fun constantly thinking getting virus?

I would definitely wear mask, but, like, face masks uncomfortable now, I’m New York. can’t imagine trying wear one 90+ weather 5,000% humidity. way. wouldn’t wear one. point, though, would much rather stay home space instead hot miserable waiting line ride. surge moronic protesters tearing shit remember someone fired several weeks ago refused manipulate numbers still hotly debated topic Cuomo family.  intend reply different comment? Always thought winker Ford GM perpetualy bankrupt. Boeing debt New Zealand. 

These major manufacturing companies death's door. Go list highly labour intensive manufacturing companies operating US story same.

The US really high tech automated manufacturing, high value low weight goods manufacturing, left country. friend mine. Masks allowed inside patient rooms confirmed case. feel like lack outrage stems fact reality apparent along. back “nobody panic” mode. us following situation already knew mask shortage. don’t remember specifically no-mask pronouncement made guess never really believed it, knew trying avoid rush already limited commodity. 

Doesn’t make right. dumbass way handle even understand reason it. list things I’m pissed about, isn’t high right now. people don’t want wear masks weren’t going anyway. reopening date planned outbreak started, decision made yesterday. refering Orange County? Amy Acton Ohio? Yes he'll board nursing homes quarantine, tradition. Overnight? hope places jump soon! third world countries don’t billionaires rich. Haha! I've designed facilities ship him. He's lying say ain't true. Thank response... guess tested again. bit colds right little heavy chested... Basically keep eye numbers next couple weeks/month. Obviously we’re holding hope things get better :/ going agree disagree situation guess. really bad situation. unlike NYC, really give much damn refrigerated trucks lining outside hospitals places. mean, literally made comments today/yesterday answered another comment. see one? thank well wishes. world isolates US (in areas beyond travel restrictions us completely understand) US retreat rugged individualism mode. Tactics work countries don’t always work US mindset ourselves. roommate moved Austin work last year. he's telling shit show, one wears masks anywhere folks bars/restaurants like theres nothing happening outside.everyone warned Texas weeks ago paying consequences

I’m sure use random metric like alcohol sales tax bars, tell one part story. It’s hard measure much people drink home versus much drink outside. need Havelock Vetinari start sarcastic people.

People need see bodies streets change behavior. Everyone acts like they’re king can’t told act. ‘Murica get portable UV stick, use office. alcohol spray towel scub hands face UV light mask, minute side trick. Always think like lab everything contaminated. one good piece news deaths dropped. one bad piece news new cases really spiking number places. 

Deaths biggest lagging indicator. Hospitalizations second biggest lagging indicator. New cases least lagging indicator have, definitely caveats number. matters big deal getting infected (ie younger vs. older people). also matters big deal %positive rate finding test conducted. Knowing %positive rate numbers test conducted time make clear much outbreak decreasing, staying same, increasing. Putting together, outbreak definitely increasing fast parts country potentially puts everyone greater risk near/medium term future. middle global pandemic all. 

By 2 weeks sooner, expect daily deaths start going again. also expect start hearing bad news stories conditions ground states things really spiking (ie #1 Arizona-very bad now, followed Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, handful states may starting outbreaks get control). 44% doctors agree premise *also* implies 56% agree premise.

Yep. Someone probably tell south korea taiwan tech bro wrote medium post relax intends slow testing, working.

What surrealistic rules valet parking like wait unless valet attendant gotten car six feet away enter need tell left key. seems ignore elephant room valet go car left endanger getting car left. course, never go wrong betting people like waited even endangers health potentially. S.Korea really strict quarantining, too. Anyone else planning move city/suburb COVID playing major role decision? needed move month anyway, wow, it’s really factoring house hunting.

I actually bought first house exact reason. job going remote move farther able afford house. 

It's surprising upside quarantine whole thing sucks. feel guilty benefitting situation think actually make us safer overall Well, whatever he's torpedo reelection chances, turning actual policy. Hey thanks saying that. Sorry goons keep making look bad. really much way ""higher ups"". Without getting specific, reports boss brand new last one got sabotaged stakeholders. stakeholders wanted get many tests possible, quickly possible, political talking point able say tested employees. would definitely smaller? think cause deafness baby, mistaken. agree way China handled effectively curbing spread US failed many aspects, saying **initial outbreak**, patients pneumonia considered positive case. Asymptomatic cases considered positive cases (well documented hope u r arguing this). Hope u get mean instead calling racist, thanks! Next time get huff puff, read comment you’re responding to. never said wrong talk kids going on. There’s nothing wrong informing kids virus. encourage it. encourage listen experts CDC State Health Departments. Especially adults, like ones here, ignore experts take things hands spread ignorant fear. 

What telling kids going school, they’re going get teachers others, killed. That’s stupid fucking comment shouldn’t even told adults. It’s true know experts said so. got everyone killed came contact virus, would put national lockdown kept homes. weren’t. one’s susceptible this, are. Nursing retirement homes locked off. don’t think second majority school districts thinking every way possible make sure everyone safe. 

Now go day fuck’s sake. must know real scientists. far apparent super spreader events detected marches protests, likely helped outside also many protesters wearing masks.

The super spreader events discussed almost entirely happened indoors. really interesting one funeral Albany, seems nonsensical think funerals small town southern USA go - several hundred people crowded funeral parlor, standing around, crying blubbering hugging one another, talking deceased. part funeral last *hours* followed procession cemetery, whereupon people crammed small tent crying hugging. might dinner snacks enclosed space, yet another opportunity pass along infectious viral load. 

All would take one person situation infected, crying, hugging every person funeral funeral parlor room become unintentional hug death. SHIT Oof. thinking direct consequence recent protests? Lots people getting sick? 

Regardless, that's terrible. hope people listen. Arlington,Texas southerner here.
My wife, kid masked everywhere go.
I mask work.
The rest population got tired virus.

""Virus? virus?"" smh Everyday last 7 weeks set new 7-day average record hospitalizations AZ, trend looks continue week also... Username checks out! :)  So, half professionals think second wave would bigger? 

Poor headline. destruction “social distancing” goes beyond possible prevention passing diseas. ensures distraction people’s livelihoods. Plus numerous studies concluded 100% social distancing extreme. Would kill ant bazooka? one said anything keeping economy shutdown. entire last point wrote opposite that: shutdown, tanked economy now, what? Places reaching peak points back March shutdown.

We're hard enougg time getting numbers without people bringing cases in! takes people longer others, see enough sickness area among family friends change like wish well sometime wonder somebody like dying virus would help people finally take seriously can't make wear mask, won't.

That makes absolutely sense.

Edit add:

Massachusetts performed molecular coronavirus tests **775,332** individuals. **102,000** positive individuals. 

The population Massachusetts **6.89 million**. arent many cities Canada go two providences. United States, There's several cities hundreds thousands people metropolitan areas go across multiple states. example, NYC, Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Omaha, Louisville, Cincinnati, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Providence, etc. There's many essential workers cross state borders daily cities 14 day quarantine impractical throw visitors nursing homes. excuse fact promptly followed sticking head far ass hear anyone trying advise him.

 NYT: EU Prepares Block Americans Visiting Due Trump’s COVID Bungling

European Union countries prepared block Americans entering reopen economies due United States’ failure contain spread virus, according draft lists travelers deemed acceptable entry EU obtained [The New York plan implemented, Americans along Russian Brazilian travelers, would prohibited visiting countries EU — clear rebuke President Trump’s handling virus United States, 2.3 million cases exceeded countries staggering death toll 120,000.

The Times reported European nations currently considering two potential lists welcome visitors — exclude Americans. lists drafted include countries fared well managing coronavirus pandemic. China, well developing nations like Uganda, Cuba Vietnam, appear lists, according Times.

American travelers travelers around world barred EU exceptions since mid-March.

A final decision regarding let border restrictions relaxed expected early next week, group countries formally reopens July 1.

The move EU similar one made Trump March, President enraged European leaders banning citizens EU countries traveling United States. Trump justified ban essential protecting United States, time 1,100 coronavirus cases 38 deaths.

Trump hinted restrictions would loosened remarks late May early June, lifted ban since then. Meanwhile Europe largely calmed outbreak, even United States see infections continue spike new hotspots around country Trump continues refuse wear mask send states resources needed expand testing.

Stopping American travel European Union would greatly impact economic relations business summer vacation plans cancelled.

While EU can’t force members follow restrictions, European officials warned border control could enforced EU nation refuses comply.

European officials said list would reconsidered biweekly basis assess changes visitors allowed within EU territory country’s caseload virus changes, according Times. Restrictions different different states according case loads. Debt crazy right now. pathetic returns treasury securities right now, basically US government paid borrow money.

That's right, give money US government, they're actually getting money getting back due inflation.

So US government, borrowing makes sense. no-brainer leave while, figured last man standing royal rumble deathmatch. Yup. Welding doors shut people inside definitely works. lot Americans poor. markets crash they'll crash. They'll blame poor people immigrants like 2008. Fed step printer pump up. vicious cycle favors people money people live paycheck paycheck. went lot kids man hard enough own. sounds hellish. guys it. Good job, mom dad. Brighter days ahead indeed. Hang there. whole planet it, yep!! I'm town near there, willful ignorance big part left. South Texas ain't good thinks is. Maine requiring hotels rental units guests sign statement quarantining 14 days, negative Covid test last three days. Cancelled September trip March. #&amp;! far over. Love Disney.

They absolutely right ban Americans now, covid spreading like wildfire decided ignore it. day headaches possibly week feeling like hit truck, prefer? Germany federal.

Yep. turns case could certainly explain big differences seeing population levels. hate here. Maybe honest. Would nice people try change. Yea, said, political discussions typically turn dumpster fires really quickly. think allowed specifically discussing politician's response actions vital conversation. Immunity COVID first time established yet. 5,112 Tex-ass! preach, homie. want people safe, store requires customers wear mask, visa versa, it. people react businesses stance completely people.

people able choose handle safety, infringes safety others, then, yes, precautions need place, like hospital example. immunocompromised person feels like cannot go business lack disease prevention, wont go business, goddamn suck can't frequent place like people giving damn putting something face hour. Trump's travel ban apply UK Ireland. UK third hadest hit country time Europe. Travel ban nothing political stunt. Ok win wow ... thanks live central Florida. Many think need wear mask MUST open everything. another example risks take virus seriously. rationalization hit young people hard, many people die anyway, people dying economy need herd immunity, wonder soon State need shut again. determined virus responses, regardless Governor’s statements saying shut down. little easier track people coming Hawaii NY though. bad deal tbh Honestly thing gave (fleeting) twinge wanting go promise uncrowded park. 

Low attendance days legit magical - walking onto space mountain, walking onto BTR, walking Radiator Springs Racer, mmmmmm.

You know theoretically go park enjoy (and spend money)? Recovered people.

It would cool ""recovered covid"" day, present documentation confirmed diagnosis plus two subsequent negative tests. Like mini herd immunity party. careful washing hands/merch..wearing 95mask..have procedure go buy bread involves 200° C...

Even virus kill many people also need determine many people require hospitalization recover. 


The whole goal lock prevent hospitals overrun slowing spread manageable situation. Hospitals serve COVID patients hospital overrun COVID patients start problems servicing people need hospital purposes: heart attacks, cancer treatments, falls, diabetes, car accidents, etc, etc. Also, hospitals meant operate 100% short period time. finite resources including people, supplies, medicine, etc. Blindingly obvious want prevent future waves Global warming. Coward confirmed. Lies denies. ever bother people idea integrity is? Ever? Taco hoarder! Truth. also matter hard try, I’m sure could ever reach depths Florida Arizona. I'm really sorry going that, man. I'm gonna throw stuff hopefully help maintain resilience come well can.

First all, word trauma works: delayed reaction. actually ""trauma disorder"" right now. traumatic stress. trauma disorder basically trauma sinks deep functioning can't return normal over. takes *time.* cases, months, sometimes years.

So window opportunity potentially avoid long-term mental health issues this. yes, potentially avoidable. anyone.

Trauma disorders caused traumatic experience. human experience anything severity come mentally well... provided right tools.

We're mostly reopened cautionary measures. Travellers must stop, must self-isolate duration 14 days. symptoms must self isolate 21 days. bad can’t even walk ramp much less ramp First off, 10-year-old absolutely left alone home little run errands, I'm sure need inside home. fact, 10 year old girl, I'd rather home alone grown man's home without supervision. Nothing personal.

Second, already established contact family allowing children play together. Kids social distance wear masks. wanted avoid risk family, allow playdates all. Trust me, 10, friends everything piggyback rides sharing water bottles one kid licking hand touching another kid's face. Since contact already established, letting kid play his/her friends seem like huge risky move. people wearing face masks inside Phoenix megachurch President Trump set speak, say reporters inside. second time less week Trump addressing supporters large, indoor gathering -- advice public health Yet none furious must wear clothes law... google trends data ""institutional racism"" ""systemic racism"" sure interesting Caligula cool then, huh? pretty sure meant memorial Day weekend obvious answer NFL teams need stage 'Covid Parties' now, get players infected bank immunity lasting rest season.

Feds never published detailed county county guidelines promised. counties locked much, opened soon. wasted two trillion dollars get us half ass lockdown. fucked medically economically next 15 months.

Here won;t next 15 months US figure controlling virus fixes economy

It's went way make racist point fair, commonly believed seat belt would trap car burst flames (it don't). also believed wearing mask harmful wearer (it's not)... Lord help us takes 40 years talk people masks. RIP everyone preexisting medical conditions like myself.

Bars restaurants breathing lot people's exhalations time, everyone talking (which means droplet generations), often times elevated volumes heard ambient noise.

Makes wonder properly spaced theatres temp checks mandatory masks - people shutting fuck movies, hopefully everyone's plumes would subdued/settle?

Bars even worse Restaurants. Chemically lowered inhibitions, lots yelling.

Seems like actual best guidance is:

shopping- ok. get shit get out.

restaurants - dine in. take out. get shit get out. legalize takeout cocktails help restaurants get better revenue.

Bars - go only. get shit get out.

TLDR: get shit get out. 💀 🧻 Saying think needed government officials lie face troubling. May want rethink approach think good governance.

Two main reason don’t want touch mask.

1. Covid touch mask you’re wearing risk transferring virus hands wherever touch that.

2. Covid touch mask unclean hands, risk virus coming contact face.

Moral story is. Don’t touch mask you’re wearing one. conveniently left CA. wonder why... Fake tan look good nipple ring king Yes, think they’re booked near foreseeable future. I’m lookout see anything opens up. also wonder whether test accurate. don’t want false hope test positive even anxiety test negative end false. I’m looking nonetheless know need much blood possible days. Interesting see imply Americans fucking stupid trusted early truth masks. wear gloves touching bag, wash hands afterwards

I'd rather eat company restaurant, haha. meant towards people going hair cuts, dining restaurants, traveling, etc. 

Sorry you’re put shitty situation work right now. 

I hope stay healthy &amp; things start looking soon! I'm quite sure something arranged cases like this, mandatory quarantine something lots countries already people entering. allowed buy certain days week, 3 masks per person, must show national ID cards buy them, records many we've bought. government done good job preventing re-sellers, early pandemic re-sellers exploiting situation make quick cash, super illegal country. read article childeren hospitals refitted normal hospitals capacity. state even gone back lockdown yet things look like improve time soon... “People color heightened concerns racial profiling harassment due wearing face coverings public.”

I understand mothers felt comfortable leaving kids outside, authority gainsay them. 

As kids' social contact, right: social distance. mostly kept inside last week so. lower risk outdoor transmission, wife discussed decided risk willing accept, kids could get daily exercise play maintain friendships.

There's huge difference making assumption conclusively proving something. said latter accomplished yet, h2h transmission exist. Yes, changed policy sisters hospital day cdc came new guidelines clearly important cdc speak up.

Pretty much, yeah. I’d wager won’t see broad-scale lockdowns happen again, however, economy may take another hit probably won’t recover from. last hope American public wakes decides start wearing masks, starts avoiding large gatherings social events, odds low. We've done Australia. sure still recommendation everywhere else. Although we've banned countries. Yeah, Germany solid meatpacking industry covid spike.

Definitely killing there. us EU, Americans look same. Also worth noting, guidelines assume healthy doctor dealing sick people, mask protecting you.

In case COVID, opposite. presumed already sick, mask protecting others. already sick, touch mask irrelevant. guy claiming bigotry people New Jersey states forcibly quarantining arresting residents refused so? guy claimed Trump quarantining state amounts civil war? reason state well entire state got virus already due failures leader. really. social media back allowing idiots voice organize themselves.

Nah. know fake news point. media sure quiet week ago rioters practicing social distancing burned cities. symptoms USA whole positivity rate today around 5% Statista many states substantially lower-I agree need go further. performing way tests per million Italy, Germany, Sweden, France, Netherlands, Canada. USA also testing anyone wants tested-most EU testing people symptoms (looks like Germany Portugal allowing anyone get tested)-The USA picking large amount asymptomatic mild cases-if countries testing people symptoms missing cases count.It would interesting compare hospitalization rates find country outside USA.

Per CDC :The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate 94.5 per 100,000, highest rates people 65 years age older (286.9 per 100,000) followed people 50-64 years (143.0 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates cumulative increase COVID-19 pandemic continues.

Having comparable info would let us know picking mild cases actually find  forgot Charlottesville. That's always big stop p-resident.

Unfortunately hate drives votes sells air space ads. fault. media's fault. Nope, open season here. required public transport still see lot people wearing busses trains. kinds new protocols be?

I'm betting thing 50 states soon enough. missed word ""preliminary."" means tweet actually says ""We found clear evidence results werent conclusive one way even bother reporting it?

To keep people up-to-date. Bingo. fact, lack social support cause trauma disorders.

The human psyche's resilience almost entirely based around human interconnection. human go traumatic event come fine sufficient human interconnection.

So, people go through, let's say, abuse, develop trauma, actually abuse caused it. takes months years develop trauma disorder, caused event. caused person access community human interconnection, help re-regulate traumatic experience.

Without interconnection, humans develop mental disorders even without traumatic event all. neglected children usually suffer much actively abused children, look outcomes adulthood.

Interconnection vital human health babies denied socialization literally die, even kept fed, hydrated, clean. Denial socialization alone enough kill human child.

It completely stands reason quarantine causing severe outbreak trauma disorders. UK, tax originally used pay NHS, Unemployment Benefits state pension called National Insurance exactly idea it. world going devolve bubbles - fight losing battle tooth nail, accepted risk moved on. virus going away, indefinitely long damn time indeed. frustrating. work, that's valid. many people straight either believe real, care. want inconvenienced slightest. Oh no, can't go beach movies! Grow fuck - nobody gets want right now. \^This makes cry laugh. Bolton agree talk time?

Uncertain death there's small chance die (larger landing points). Movies WWII show intense naval aerial bombardments amphibious assaults.

Thats EVERYONE got virus. severe symptoms listed happening small percentage infected people. fact is, death rate virus somewhere around 0.5% - 1% deaths heavily skewed towards older people. Since, like mentioned, single recorded reinfection yet, one knows getting multiple times affect people, concluding death sentence ELE fearmongering, quite frankly, fucking ridiculous. got source that? Also know % kids flu vaccine year? it’s high percentage uptake still lower percentage mortality great stat show people maybe 2 minds it. thorough enforced restrictions driving, punishments reckless behavior. I’m sorry question answered already, positive cases coronavirus tested population US, many symptoms vs asymptomatic? individuals tested positive, many wore masks, vs disregarding, wearing masks? CDC lists pneumonia flu-like illnesses accounting 16% death certificates week, 5 times greater normal. good news 100% confirmed summer weather’s enhancement immune systems, plus potential strong UV rays kill virus, masking doomsday fall winter?

Not sound incredibly pessimistic, don’t want false hope spread public half country refuses wear mask. daddy wouldn’t like though... critical leaders model good sense Good! Plenty americans listen regardless. realize 0.1% people symptomatic cases (and 0.05% people infected flu without symptoms) die, right? similar group people risk dying flu, risk actually dying infected flu far lower. 0.05% 0.5-1% different numbers talking potential significant share world’s population becoming infected.

Also hope realize incredibly insensitive many people lost loved ones COVID-19. People “fatties” genetics, poverty, or, sometimes, poor choices. people made poor choices (again did, obesity, diabetes, smoking, drug use structural many countries like US) doesn’t mean deserve die families deserve lose them. goes people elderly. could easily 60 year old died virus would otherwise lived 100 made great impact world. 2022 Groundhog Day eh?  muh freedoms- covid idiots Depends type mark, protect yourself. tennis matches much afterparty  definitely have, many people have, even communities have...but think, exceptions, collective effective soul searching ends. implication tweet clear. reaction caused exactly line implication.

I've thinking, what's going happen 40-50 years silent damage comes forefront we've got whole generation retirees growing lung issues? Crazy much shit Sweden got locking down. Turns really important, good move.


It masks (lack of) error. post here. thing that's glossed damage internal organs, increased clotting, stroke. Even kids likely survive infection mature adult, really ok watching kids suffer? bothers me, thinking daughter needing tubes struggles breath. seriously considering heart breaking see kid rigged like Ghost Shell overhaul?

Covid, anxiety chronic fatigue worrying year. 

Wear mask people! literally LEAST do. solid legal basis?

Normally, state (as government, state federal) broad powers quarantine, courts tend uphold those.

But seems like state might stepping federal toes, since involves interstate commerce/traffic/freedom-of-movement.

Would negated turning away border, allowing sequestering? Makes sense.

When actively telling people get tested severe symptoms, large percentage people never even show symptoms, super mild symptoms never get tested, gonna large percentage people arent gonna get tested.

It seems politicized know... Literally reason besides POTUS trying see much mind control followers. 

I honestly care know... 1 less Trump voter. 

The R party needs housecleaning. would politically impossible. Nobody would support government initiative intentionally infect people potentially deadly virus, even optimal method saving lives.

The UK government attempted similar strategy beginning: people risk ""shielded"" isolating rest country, disease allowed spread ""low-risk"" population freely. spur-of-the-moment decision, plan dealing viral epidemic almost decade. Nonetheless public outraged government ""weren't enough"" believed locking like every country. Eventually political pressure much government buckled. New Yorkers left Florida places, requests self isolate enforced. Lt. Gov practially begged happen way. Now, reap sown. ppl sent jail imho.... selfish ppl hell going there? one scummiest things I’ve ever seen

They fighting pandemic, people calling liars... advantage Russia possibly infections occur early Italy Spain. country thus able observe distance expecting, least Moscow began build bed capacity quickly. authorities closed border China early end January imposed lockdown end March, much stricter Germany.

In Moscow, people allowed leave homes weeks end take rubbish go nearest supermarket. Permits applied Internet trips work doctor - otherwise fines threatened. regions also adopted system. time, laws tightened overall: anyone infects others coronavirus could face severe penalties, including prison.

The tough Russian course also reflected Government Response Stringency Index, measure developed researchers Oxford University make measures taken countries comparable. includes 17 different indicators, type extent school closures, curfews financial aid.

The following chart shows Government Response Stringency Index Russia countries. value 0 represents response all, value 100 represents stringent possible response corona crisis.

The consequences lockdown road traffic Russia similar Germany - strong France, Spain Italy. shown look mobility data several Russian cities, Apple calculated navigation requests.

According data, traffic collapsed within days end March around 40 percent average value 4th calendar week 2020. even slightly less Berlin. mid-June figures risen back level corona crisis, cases even beyond.

Officials like attribute fact Russia far come pandemic relatively unscathed health system. ""Have ever thought possibility Russia's healthcare system could efficient,"" Kremlin spokesman Dimitrij Peskow last replied asked low death figures. say many doctors staff clinics medical facilities Russia already died virus: 489, according official figures. Germany number seven times less: 67 employees hospitals nursing homes. meantime Putin called deceased heroes.

Another reason given lower life expectancy, lower Western countries. also means number elderly people, often weakened pre-existing conditions, lower, according one explanation. However, biological age people also lower, especially regions living conditions harsher.

In addition, comparatively old people's homes Russia; together psychiatric institutions, 1,300 homes 250,000 inhabitants. Germany alone 15,000 nursing homes.

It possible older Russians particular benefit vaccination Soviet era. time, vaccination tuberculosis living pathogens compulsory, even today Russians still entitled it, longer compulsory vaccination. indications studies immune system react better coronavirus vaccination.

Relaxation early?

Even Putin recently emphasised much better Russia coping pandemic USA - countries taking similarly risky path comes easing measures. Although infections still far fallen significantly everywhere, return normality decreed virus already defeated.

Putin economic reasons, political reasons. Wednesday president wants hold great military parades marking end Second World War 75 years ago, cancelled May 9th Corona. finally let Russians vote constitutional amendments 1 July.

Do new outbreaks threaten hundreds soldiers march in, tens thousands streets? Moscow, mayor appealed people watch parade front TV instead streets usual. 13 regions preferred cancel parades capitals, risk seems great them.

But everyone go vote - people go polling stations. Online voting possible two regions: Moscow Nizhny Novgorod. people moving around tourist areas = vectors spreading disease. negative test entry means perfect method. clueless posts continue. states lockdowns sort. ones least restrictions ones suffering now. states restrictions, level countries, opened soon. please stop comparing lockdowns countries. never national lockdown national strategy deal virus. idiot-in-chief wants kill supporters, really place stop him? thing called flying seems give fairly quick connection distant places generally situation take one errant breath got it. need build 'tipping point' virus lungs, basically. sit 4 feet someone hour long conversation, end breathing enough exhaled air cross tipping point point conversation. 

A good way dramatically push amount time takes hit tipping point distance, wear masks, outside greater air circulation.

Hmm, kinda weird sought make point first place. like... anything that? give +1 authoritarianism shits? thing could make tough time zones, job flexible work gets done I'm golden. virus reached Russia weeks later Italy, Spain Germany, provided officially reported numbers infected persons correctly reflect actually happening. According this, virus spread first capital, St. Petersburg Caucasus south - example Ingushetia seen.

Moscow already passed first wave infection - easily recognisable heat map white light blue colouring since end May. St. Petersburg, hand, things looking good, number infections falling, much slower rate capital. authorities finding difficult get pandemic control. Initially, doctors patients reported little protective clothing medication, focus criticism poor management hospitals. also lack doctors. Nevertheless, responsible governor relaxed restrictions. Moscow, Saint Petersburg reports highest death rate per 100,000 inhabitants country.

Many regions Novosibirsk Sverdlovsk oblasts still beginning wave infection middle - visible red coloration right shows.

At time, majority Russia's regions have, Kremlin's request, abolished curfews imposed restrictions - possibly soon.

So far, five people per 100,000 inhabitants officially died Covid-19 Russia. new figures Rosstat taken account, including died infection, figure could well twice high. Russia would thus currently par Germany.

The total number deaths Russia continue rise significantly coming weeks. Currently, average 150 new deaths added every day - see following chart.

But figures trusted general? 

Various Russian media reported pathologists put pressure hospital administrations health authorities. doctors give diseases cancer, heart attack, bacterial pneumonia chronic diseases cause death. one death certificate might quite correspond found autopsy.

Wanting better position vis-à-vis authorities higher still common practice Russia today. Republic Komi north-west country Bashkortostan region south Urals southern edge Russia, example, chief physicians clinics officials health authorities long reported everything control. number patients later deaths pneumonia, typical clinical picture Covid-19, increased. 60 percent participating doctors said Internet survey believe corona statistics.

There much discussion speculation Internet forums plausibility Russian corona figures:

- example, regions reported exactly infection rates several days row;

- Altai region southern Siberia, numbers sent governor words ""for approval"", note quickly removed made subject discussion social networks;

- Data various authorities differ, reported death figures places fluctuate greatly. Facebook, map circulating regions colored according credibility corona data. According analysis mathematician, data without conspicuities 30 areas.

Reporting deceased, trust authorities

The extreme gradient town country also poses problems. Dagestan North Caucasus, example, statistics hardly plausible. mid-May, Region's Minister Health caused sensation stated 660 people died bilateral pneumonia. time, official figure 27 corona deaths. Caucasus Republic reports 340 people died Covid-19. However, since end May, reported handful infections deaths every day. number deaths recently even multi-year average, fewer people currently dying usual.

""People dying home,"" reports one demographer. relatives, however, go authorities report death. deceased would buried, one would know anything it. true number victims probably known several months. Rosstat also said regions expected dead would still reported authorities.

Nevertheless, Russia pretty well far - even take account official figures show whole picture. so?

We lucky virus leaves 2 3 people permanently disabled every one kills. absolutely destroy quality life far people kills. true Arizona less 10 contact tracers??? so, earth going break chain infection every cluster popping Arizona right now? wtf Improving survival rates factor decreasing mortality rates factor. use 83% survival treated 78% survival non-treated, let us five percentage points difference. use 78% baseline, 5/78 relative improvement survival rate, 6.4%. say, modest advance right direction needs least duplicated support small hopes. 

If talk decrease mortality, 100-78 = 22% untreated group 100-83 = 17% treated group. relative decrease mortality, taking 22% reference group, 22-17 = 5 5/22 = 22.7% mortality reduction. bad all, percentage make us believe larger number.

Summarily, would need treat 20 patients condition save live. study corroborated well executed studies. Thought might point that, unless intense pressure choose one other, reporting reporting threatened harrased make someone weak strong. choice.

Keep god damn border shut, watch modified Stanley Cup Playoffs August let relatively normal summer begin. agree you!

I saying it’s hard tell many people infected testing, look death rate work backwards great estimate number infections, knowing death rate 4 1000. would like doubt doctor really say that, truth doctors US skeptical. given interviews TV saying it’s really big deal. Especially deep heart Texas  probably chinese N95's knows effective properly made actaully are. Singapore S. Korea good run opened democracy. 14 day quarantine people traveling provinces Canada. I'm sure strictly enforced, everyone know came province followed it. Ever wonder professionals wear masks? Look guys, ""don't stupid"" solid advice, also way life. look away people stare wear mask. exponential growth, timing shutdown makes big difference, LA shut days Bay Area. lot exceptions order (things strict Bay; LA's work construction sites, example, never slowed). 

There also lot deeply conservative pockets Southern California, like South Bay Orange County, rejected lot lockdown mask requirements. measuring volume alcohol sold U.S. Gains retailers, huge obvious declines bars, restaurants, stadiums, etc. America would still reelect subscription based model news? would suggest paying reporters? 

News isn’t exactly kind thing pay you’re good, know right? People actually go find new news, that’s it’s called news. Finding new news requires new money every month. Shocking, right? non-stop campaign active disinformation top government effective. Especially trickles governors. underestimate it. blood fully hands. Name another country wearing masks politicized. can't. us. made portions populace effectively insane deadly pandemic. genocide refuse call that. newsbreak.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ignoring increasing rates positive cases. Walking pneumonia. one raging Covid maniacs early on. January mid April. point growth exponential (I used word posts) intervene millions Americans would die. ran beds, death rate would treble. course bore lot ridicule position. much time official forecast 60,000 deaths.

Currently official US position do-nothing course would resulted 3 million deaths. early effective intervention held level current mere 120,000. believe first sentence.

I disagree. mother almost died COVID-19 3 5 children still onboard opening everything back letting pandemic kill millions people.

Representative democratic governments same. good leaders, shit leaders. Yes. Abbott confirmed last week available bed number includes children’s hospital beds. include adult psychiatric facility beds might include children psychiatric facilities. discussed Q&amp;A missed detail. I'm history buff means authoritarian regimes start? president declares power due situation, usually war, never relinquish it. update website daily number cases overall capacity Fauci's good man, lie done good faith, good reason, still lie. Surgeon General's statements masks backed science, unfortunately created optics informed elite hoarding life-saving supplies uninformed masses. could've honest told people mask (even cloth) keeps droplets going far. Meanwhile, UK start requiring masks public transport June 15. Utterly shambolic response pandemic Tories. don’t care. care money. slow motion. you’re train. know it’s happening. can’t stop it. Tell worry, handling get go made recession severe everyone, there’s tourism money spending. hate piggy-back, question. live cluster rural counties wherein less 30 cases three surrounding counties. pay attention news therefore know bad life-threatening be, yet locally one two mild cases required hospitalization. leading lot people think even get it, bad all. even know think, say, anymore. zero cases, person initially get virus? practice talking returning residents already there, go hospital. hospitals overrun, capacity let patients serve quarantine there. NY either.

This state failing, another consequence failure testing got us path first place. doubt that, look happening much country. Complete incompetence federal level.

one-in-five people NYC virus, think elder care facility potentially exposed needed able manage virus? one said brilliant idea, far it. mean necessary circumstances. [Johns Hopkins put study said wasn’t good.  think it’s really good giving false positives. that’s really useful you’re trying catch potential carriers. would better quarantine extra people got false positive let gobs false negatives walk around. that’s world live in. oh methanol never good. point simply unexpected. always thought common sense anything containing ethanol intended ingested also contains least methanol.

Then again, told little, certain food stuff contained trace amounts lead back something. Maybe things improved since. genuinely, honestly idea that’s true. can’t make assumptions points don’t data. anyone checking people confirmed suspected cases Covid, they’re feeling weeks months later? I’m seeing alarming amount anecdotal data people still affected long “recovered.” would hesitant assume it’s significant affect many people. would personally speak managers manager! Italy's lockdown pretty strict, people even leave town residence without legitimate reason. 

Right reopening, everyone wear masks everytime store, example. People could leave towns, leave region. 

It pretty gradual people respecting rules. Also, political party, even populist ones, much safety measures. say I'm heavily misinformed proceed tell wrong timeline WHO's response lol I'm good info trying provide bud. clearly living fantasy land Swedish tabloids ran Swedish angle suppose. Always best try find local source. Hotels Hawaii using ""one time keys"". check in, get key, open door once. Leave room 14 quarantine can't get back in. Unless go front desk admit broke law. 

most idiots arrested post social media breaking quarantine. got multiple warnings, like one first couples arrested got 3 separate warnings throughout day police getting arrrested. overall enforcement minimal, like enough catch stupid kicking people can't choose quarantine one place, i.e. physical address arrived within 14 days, paying trip home.

And less 900 cases date, less 200 considered ""active"". Please fuck us come enjoy beautiful little islands. Mahalo! yes, longest quarantine world, shitty record have. authoritarian dictatorships workplaces US state upholds them. /r/HealthAnxiety Also I'm visiting NY mean car me. yeah could easily in-state rental. Viruses like like covered paint like that. Look another way - yes, covid-19 particularly contagious, viruses would sit clothes get infected touch them, sick allll time. sitting clothes, would high enough concentration rub hands it, wash them, rub face.

Not trying downplay anything, basic mask hand washing precautions work. Yup. Parents moved CA HI middle quar (it planned move, due COVID) required 14 day quarantine. said like police social workers something would check every day, think calling? think maybe even visiting residence occasionally.  Tell Argentina's government. +100 quarantine days. insane here, clearly sanitary quarantine anymore. Abdul Karim Rana becomes ‘govt doctor Rahul Thakur’ cheat coronavirus patients seeking plasma donors, arrested police

The fraudster Abdul Karim Rana reportedly identified Rahul Thakur, government doctor duped patients claiming money donating blood plasma. Many us (see Northeast) It’s absurd first thought “will people follow this?”

I live East Coast Canada months, people followed government rules. didn’t (and got caught) handed hefty fine. Shut up, go home follow rules. simple. Texas Medical Center biggest medical center world. [Here’s it’s cluster buildings foreground Downtown Houston background. picture years old doesn’t even include whole TMC time, it’s expanded last years.

Without direction body dies. Imagine cells voting lead them. Lack resources rarely help anyone. ...and getting boufant hairstyles redone. define authoritarianism? US literally authoritarianism private tyranny. boss forcing remote workers come back work unsafe conditions considered authoritarianism? US even make something basic face masks.

The country dependent outside world many basic essentials life.

Fortunately Americans, blocking tourism mean blocking trade goods. Hopefully sources actual people screen prints reporting. could find shit, lost back.  Fire sheriffs. People need jobs. Hire someone follow simple rule. Well indirectly tried stay open protect economy. true US really weak social safety nets compared countries tho. Still, country plans remain lockdown 2021 low death numbers? Hey hate then. forgot /s tag might want edit get less comments like mine.:) charge come bridge refuse let go. Lmao. Sweat transmit virus. Look, asshole. things important living. Texans need keep going restaurants order save economy grandchildren.

/s 2 meters isn’t far enough considerable drop last couple months? uk alone even mentioning places Europe seen less 2m rule continued see drop? Regardless comment nothing whether I’m happy things eased uk, talking think it’s disgusting comments like aren’t rare Reddit let alone sub. idea second wave something that’s funny it’ll prove armchair epidemiologists right pathetic. late US here, start new US Mars NO

Because wore teh magic mask virus WOKE brought good vibes course didnt spread COVID runs hate!!!! hope do. country needs outside punishment bad damn virus. honestly announce it. Saying one considering something nothing unless one actually it. makes sense. Thanks! Hopefully case! hope people realize key word could available, business regardless size get help government. feeling winter going slaughter. School colleges set reopen fall slim protocols (so far). sure making decisions, they’re made public’s interest. let's see whose economy better months come Yay, virus disappear? Yeah. I’m rush go restaurant. see working out. UV-flash passengers face breath take. could work. good idea. provide source? Ive seen states Florida? Raise more. hard work. 

16/hr really exciting 2020. Many states 15 minimum easy retail/food service jobs. Debated like true teenager. Try years. No, common sense. 

I support BLM let's lie ourselves. protests increased spread. I’m Texas, manager says can’t refuse service wearing mask. sucks job literally get close take eyeglass measurements. 8.7 million end March?!? Holy fuck!

Also, 8.7 million cases then, fuck make IFR now... Lol see info? never understood argument nobody able explain wearing mask somehow taking away liberties freedoms. time day people argue bans smoking unjust despite mountain evidence dangers second hand smoke anti-vaxer movement despite mountain evidence benefits vaccines. least anti-vaxers legs stand regards mandatory vaccines infringing rights; benefits society public health far far outweigh infringement. masks, literately leg stand blind devotion con artist coward. people seriously represent worst society. agree. think assumption long term consequences anyone misguided, also think assuming significant side effects also misguided. People look declining death rates due shift demographics disease now, like ""psshhhh"" nothing worry about.  They're also landlocked like many european countries american states, borders north korea, whose citizens can't cross. lot easier contain compared countries multiple borders free travel. Also visiting foreigners quarantine sent food, supplies government. government everything encourage people follow protocol. apparently lot white supremacists tho labeled terrorists there. funny everyone thinks Trudeau big tough closed borders lol Interestingly enough, Gov different story... think hydroxychloroquine Trump said took course prophyllactically fact bother testing surely Trump must think cannot catch covid perhaps it. Send death threats health officials, America. Today's new cases: 31,496.

Add states reporting cases 1k: 5,528 + 5,112 + 2,926 + 2,196 + 1,265 + 1,227 + 1,008 = 17,066 new cases. states Southern way.

31,496 - 17,066 = 14,430 new cases elsewhere.

There new cases South anywhere else country. Sidenote, US crossed 1M recoveries.

One person’s “fear mongering” another person’s “information best defense”.  would nice rich nations allowed people pay 3x (or whatever) price vaccine, enable poor countries access. vaccine cost $5 $20, would pay people CAR receive it. virus taught us one goddamn world need look ffs. answer I’m looking one comes governmental body. word nice I’m still square one I’ve got clue stop wearing masks. Illinois finally recovering reopening slowly surely. want us close borders keep no-mask wearers away. many dead even need jfc People can't pay rent creates land lotds can't pay mortgages.

Luckily retired Florida’s unemployment site created make people give apply. Meanwhile Virginia slowly opening feel optimistic headed right direction.

Watching dc metro vs Florida insane. watch one governor say wear masks respect others safe. one can’t stop lying storms like toddler. I'm San Antonio. Mmhmm  Conspiracy theory time, Trump already it. ongoing effort spam news site comments bots. Many local news outlets proper resources combat this.

It's obviously happening hometown paper too. liberal college town, 90% population wearing masks voluntarily.

Suddenly comments section wash absolute rage new mask mandate...lol...nope. quick blame people ignorant idiots believing whatever crap they're told Facebook.

It depends resourced area is, though.

I speak mine. Someone know actually said “yeah don’t believe shit here”. Like, believe in? problem, cities blame neighborhoods, blame residents. point everyone blame... actually kind accurate. based LA Times story Checking missed cases COVID-19 requires examining preserved tissue, test available CDC limiting California — state 39 million people — eight 10 cases week. state Health Department stepped gatekeeper county morgues federal end May, state agency forwarded two cases CDC 40 deaths state review.   Punishments really think people 26+ bars 21-25 year olds?? idea let bunch people money extended amount time?

Nope. That's virus's idea. think people going flock back bars NYC am, naive person thread. NYers idiots going stay far away bars vaccine. think irrelevant. people going working bars restaurants 2022. opinion matter. Neither sounds like would kill people virus.

Well, won't. take word it. Let's talk numbers. numbers using? believe overblown bunch deaths causes reported COVID 🙄 tomorrow? think would learned countless protesters contracted virus anti-lockdown protests. virus coming swat Magats! I'm pretty fucking glad ordered 50 KN95 masks week two ago seemed like everyone forgotten covid. got couple days ago, tell they're shitload better surgical/cloth masks wearing bit. least keep safe rare times need leave house now.

Neither I. reading crap looking numbers. 31k new cases today yet 362 deaths. Something happened. Age people affected, deadliness virus, treatment. knows. guess r/coronavirusrecession r/china_flu anyone feel increasingly desensitized whole virus? I’ve genuinely started believing psychologically something happening externally life / circumstances, like myth, level. I’m conspiracy theorist, I’m suggesting it’s super weird place right mentally. There’ve many phases, feels like it’s massive ploy :( Freaks I've seeing stories serious complications **and ""recovering""** covid. hope true, would suck **so bad** partied one day serious health complications rest life. Phase 3 needs large sample population. Brazil seems like useful location test. q quotes:

he Nature Medicine paper analyzes 37 asymptomatic cases, found contact tracing testing efforts Wanzhou District Centers Disease Control Prevention central China, screened 2,088 close contacts coronavirus patients February early April.

The asymptomatic patients hospitalized observation. Fifty-seven percent showed lung abnormalities CT scan, sensitive imaging technique produces three-dimensional picture lungs. showed ""striped shadows,"" others presented ""ground-glass opacities"" — clear signs inflammation find many asymptomatic patients significant changes CTs quite surprising,"" says Dr. Alvin Ing, professor respiratory medicine Macquarie University involved study. shows even people outward signs infection experiencing temporary damage lungs. feeds pattern he's seen treating COVID-19 patients: ""The symptoms underestimate severity disease."" words, coronavirus often taxing person's body severely symptoms — lack thereof — findings consistent several studies following asymptomatic patients China, found many develop lesions lungs despite outward symptoms, says Dr. Jennifer Taylor-Cousar, pulmonologist National Jewish Health Denver involved paper. ""It probably is, least disease, pretty common,"" New York seen similar patterns. Dr. Jorge Mercado, pulmonologist critical care doctor NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn affiliated study, says he's seen many instances patient come hospital issue related COVID-19 tested positive coronavirus. ""Those patients evolved paper illustrates, [their coronavirus infections] causing pneumonia, causing inflammatory changes,"" says. Yeah course, masks, fairly high compliance ratings, group, tend we're told, probably helps lot. worried states actually want testing. pharmacy chains private companies partnering state governments ramp testing. Even though years know true death rate suspect rate going lower since vulnerable already died. we’re seeing cases spike states actively reporting Covid deaths two it’s lower saw NE epicenter I've hoping that, think unlikely. One restaurants frequently dines (with 15-20 people!) news today employees tested positive. He's following distancing recommendations really anything meaningful. I'll surprised changes always hope. Although true states like FL, younger people leading surge, older cohorts starting rise well April peaks well. See \[1\] look 45+ 55+ lines. groups significant levels underlying conditions. cohort obviously surging 85+ group. last piece good news, overall story good. 

\[1\] e) blame Chinese again

f) take responsibility past mistakes try get right time BS... Canada aint testing much people officially dying diseases gotta order room service. basically tell people land don’t want live like go back home  Evidence widespread asymptomatic transmission? Please provide actual evidence -- contact tracing -- mathematical models ""evidence."" rolling average positives negative? can’t enforce mandate masks limit tourism summer keeping much retail closed possible long possible I'm seriously baffled many people see coming. Maybe enough bleach, UV lights chloroquine. wear masks police busy driving around Harlem night sirens keeping people up. terrifying. state. Cases surging everyone like, “we can’t close anything, everyone’s going kill starve death don’t work!” Okay, wear mask! “But muh freedumb!!” asking literally impossible matter fact offending party always claim ignorance.

It's literally impossible show scientific evidence claims making? one thing single expert missing certain paper. show publications respected journals reasonably assume experts aware of, making statements contradicting them, could give reason assume used word ""MALICE"". said ""MALICE"" strawman said lying good intentions, save healthcare workers need masks even more!

Generally speaking, ""lying"" assumed malicious. implying benevolent lying instead, apologies. Regardless, point remains: scientific evidence leads believe likely knowingly lying simply changed policy new information came even pdf flyer page (but called ""pre-symptomatic"")

I hope understand ""asymptomatic"" ""pre-symptomatic"" scientific study dated back February

A study late February, reporting single case study? Hm, sounds like would kind thing would alert scientific community look issue study it, right? directly quote findings report presumed transmission asymptomatic carrier replicated, prevention COVID-19 infection would prove challenging.

It's almost like reports came out, scientific community looked see report could replicated, mid March revising opinion masks. almost like [by early April CDC officially recommended masks, even homemade cloth ones, based body research come previous month 

And that's main difference general public ""knows"" scientific community ""knows."" change public policy recommendations based single case report study, even though single article diluted reported mainstream media takes general public ""know"" something. takes time examine evidence make decision. preponderance evidence came forth, scientific community revised recommendations. takes bullet points healthcare workers suggest healthcare workers need general population, masks useless general population.

Sure, never said masks would ever useless general population. yet another instance subtle nuances go public health policy lost upon general public. judged benefits great enough public recommend wearing masks. That's it. grand conspiracy, legions public health experts somehow lying lockstep other. judged information available time primary benefit masks would protecting wearer, general public much risk, healthcare workers were. realized primary benefit masks protecting everyone else, recommendations changed. one protected every monkey symptoms? Oh Jesus. terrible spun yet another political divide US. would think public health would take priority political games. lol I've wondering uptick would start. imagine time death longer used due better treatment, would also mean longer trips icu overcrowding almost afraid say it, Swedes could read come, absurd omission, Poland completely open Swedish visitors now. conspiracy nut, I’m personally side want get Covid I’m playing mostly safe there’s much don’t know disease long term effects. go see friends attend gatherings &lt;20 occasionally, I’m still extra cautious wear mask whenever I’m indoors public sort thing.

That said, find interesting swiftly rhetoric subreddit changed. really feels like death # continued drop even cases increased, discussions solely changed focusing long term effects, permanent health damage even mild cases, folks still recovered.

The thing don’t doubt lot this. don’t think it’s proven yet it’s certainly risk I’m going take sense I’ll living like normal going packed parties places. think it’s funny talking points shifted heavily subreddit deaths “you’ll sick forever!” I’m Nola lot people really taking seriously. go Quarter appointment weekend amazed amount tourists wandering around. Lafitte’s looked like normal Saturday afternoon absolutely social distancing. We’re bad time afraid. Remember bunch states said going let NY residents in? good enough then, good enough NY now. Community policing works quite well Hawaii. island also likely makes easier, lots locals tracking getting quarentine breakers arrested. shepard's tone, soon last one dies next one starts. keep going. yeah thing im also concerned racial issues thst spawned hatred among races. even look white may harassed worse....that nuts. media refuse report it. Since hospitals cop forces get arrested filming full covid floor people know get sick enough need treatment see themselves. wait reopening Las Vegas causes folks visit around world take surprise back home. Everyone obeyed mask suggestion CDC, people businesses obeyed 6ft social distancing rules perfectly, we've abundance testing, everyone made sweeping changes life support higher attention hand washing cleanliness. also cancelled church gatherings political rallies, one even protested stay home order. shouldnt increase all, dont get it. That’s probably part it, likely they’re underreporting cases. got imported case Vietnam China last month people definitely aren’t buying odds happened one couple thousand active cases, billion. Makes wish people positions enact change would actually fucking something. 

There’s little responsible limiting exposure social distancing. Meanwhile selection fellow Americans making sure quarantine lasts long possible. 

I need something stronger beer. Agree. teens totally levelheaded it, missing friends something fierce. What’s even worse entire peer group getting together entire time wouldn’t let join. agreed me, also grieved felt hurt it. 

The loss “future” also difficult. normal pathways derailed while. He's super serial guyssss Yes, page. Depends governor/mayor at. Many would opposite would want appear politically incorrect.
. I'm honestly surprised suggest housing state visitors nursing homes point. Exponential growth happens every super spreader infects least one super spreader...  DHHS data Tuesday, 24% inpatient hospital beds 23% ICU beds available, 91% state’s hospitals reporting. hotels prestocked food? get food delivered door? ""Hey guys, feel like playing Russian Roulette?? Let's go Knight's Pub get couple pints!!!"" Hawaii Even though think enforceable, think funny may states blaming New York wanted hunt residents came states (I'm looking Florida Rhode Island) yet NY one states way containing virus (the others NJ, Mass Michigan). thing can't said majority states country. cognitive dissonance amazing. People acting like covid never ""really existed"" first place ""gubmit control."" got people freaking wear mask Disney World - meanwhile cases keep going up. Soon curve flattened anymore period what? shutdown resultant economic fallout nothing? sounds really long, thought something like ten days states free decide threshold harm citizens exactly attempt restrict movement pandemic would fail spectacularly. actually achieve desired effect limiting movement stop spread disease would require every state least lower 48 board.

You think Florida would be? Texas? pretty much southern states delayed closing opened quickly possible suffering consequences? 

Quarantine definitely doesn’t meet common justification witnessed massive pushback simple things like able get haircuts go bar. state legislation telling people can’t travel state wouldn’t even hit floor discussion. Almost like there’s pandemic going on! Huh, they’ve changed since last time looked (the original executive order allowed grocery shopping, pharmacies, gas stations). I’m supposed go late July see folks. I’ve strict lockdown since March testing available locally it’s easy confirm I’m clean. Guess I’ll bring bunch canned food. (The local stores folks deliver.) (edit: turns Instacart doesn’t operate rural Maine!) Better stock booze too, bring car...

My folks 87 fully self-quarantining anyway 2 wks trip (like, home state) order keep safe. don’t want try postpone trip next year because, y’know, they’re 87.

I’m long time camper though fine living beans &amp; rice &amp; canned goods. (shoutout Vigo’s Cuban Black Beans &amp; Rice) Texas huge number hospitals pretty large sprawl campuses TMC? That's good sign capacity. Like China! misunderstand then, sorry headache arguing pointless stuff friend. Cancer screenings also halted. Cancer also cured US! it! customers, able flag rules BS followed.

EVERYONE POST PICTURES RESTAURANT FOLLOWING MASKING DISTANCING. like watching race much next person, can't life figure reality racing ""essential""... genuinely hope do. rest world isolates US maybe enough wake call get legislators actually something.

I'm sure right people get paid though never happen. Prevalence active cases time protest? Differences pollen count? Difference temperature humidity? probably those.... Summer started last weekend really bad cases infected flu SARS2... Hospitalizations though, see website covid exit strategy current icu details several state websites fast metric growing I've never replied before. happen first name another poster. popular early 80s. 

So, um, sources please? \*AHEM\* Didnt Cuomo open lawsuit Rhode Island (my home) EXACT thing??? What's latest (good) information long lasts air indoors?

I'm curious someone come use bathroom, long air there? goddamn stupid make people come office work home. understand business closed can't make money, that's tough spot in. run business *and* stay home? would take easy prevention method?

It's frustrating people even adopting low-cost simple solutions containing virus. Germany reopened &lt;1, disease slowly starves less 1. lockdown regionally local infection rate rises certain threshold. way country continue normally. Apparently doesn't. vaccine heard immunity daily reminder gov ny put sick people hospital nursing homes, killing 100s. anyone would make terrible decision, would fuck nut. Fucking Cuomo killed seniors 

Literal human trash. High risk mean death sentence, plenty really old people high risk people recover, hear often. pretending virus doesn’t exist didn’t work? surprise. disappointing considering Phoenix local government shut down. 

One presidents events become super spreader event, meaning local state government won’t able keep lid situation control it. can’t go president, stupid administration handling mess.

he’s better put together. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* people saw drastic measures China introduced begin with, essentially enforcing lockdown tyrant extent. 

The reason virus new, nobody knew potential, took drastic measures possible. information smart it. wouldn’t accept anything less draconian lockdown till vaccine without considering affects. Federal sites closing would limit number somewhat seems risk assessment. European recommendations. exactly Sweden gone less 2 weeks? beginning tried post stuff website openly Trump got upset considering political consequences. everything sent approval WH since heads CDC spineless cowards. How’re* *

Unless full PPE times chances getting never zero. get vaccine within next years everyone probably exposed, case ita probably better everyone exposed young, isolate old people. 
This applies countries like US quarantine strict. Let’s see. states reopen early. Citizens don’t wear masks. Citizens don’t maintain social distancing. Something “freedom” something like that. 

What could go wrong? Would cool people NY quarantine leaving state... guy lol Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Sarcasm risky business. Super spreader events Thanks explaining, GonnaNutInYourButt *when one person power Legislative branch bring stop. 
 
This Mitch. seem lovely. 

The person asked question helped answer. I’m sure take personal affront that. record, *huge* difference trauma Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Trauma temporary state. even post traumatic stress PTSD. disorder part equation applies people whose symptoms chronic permanently neurological physiological nature, way DNA. 

So someone *absolutely* feel trauma symptoms number normal situations, let alone hugely abnormal events like pandemics. haven’t experienced trauma before, don’t usually words you’re feeling. don’t even possess name something happening inside you, don’t feel like power it. 

So anyway, you’re wrong, uninformed, kind dick. thick skin apparently take much pride actually pretty bad look you. funny people hate government mindless sheep. class big? read studies suggested initial SARS outbreak 2003 masks effective preventing someone getting infected. Early China told colleagues wearing mask prevent others getting germs. People worried 22 January, last day office together, saying protects visible splash snot wear correctly touch it/wear mouth only/use new one time wear one. started wearing mask woman train offered one way Beijing (23 Jan) everyone else wearing one, epidemic took problem wearing mask public sort prefer it. 

Overall think people wore masks area China thought would protect infected. good side effect near 100% mask-wearing months public spaces may helped lower asymptomatic spread. information different, people wear masks less (it's also hot Hades hard wear one time outdoors). imagine small outbreaks, people immediately mask again. seems happened Beijing small outbreak last week. 

I'm sad US people can't get idea looking others oneself, maybe could scare people wearing evidence helped prevent infection overall? (There limited evidence suggest anyways). Could somehow turn Americans' me-me-me attitude good trickery? Thankfully (I take virus seriously. respiratory therapist) us survive able tell tales.  happening guess big deal either: sure calling site provided alarmist, agree discrepancy ICU utilization. 

On site, clicked link ""Learn methodology data sources."" got information:
 interesting, section says ""Typical ICU utilization CCM adjusted 30% (absolute) based empirical estimates current utilization adding COVID ICU utilization."" 


CCM Covid Care Map, located here:  Right now, CCM says ICU bed occupancy rate West Virginia 67%.  

I know standard reporting method site subtracting 30% it, might explain difference sites? Right. really matter they're grossly incompetent lying us. Either way they're trusted. Wait wait wait, mean less effective wear nose time? Crazy. Next going tell em hang neck talk someone ineffective. protests seem lot transmission 1) outdoors, 2) people wearing masks. Trump Coronapalooza indoors mostly maskless. sorry dude mean angry. frustrated amount people scared cause amount misinformation virus.  Probably going sugar epitope. See paper called somthing like ""...to sweet remeber..."" look one pubmed. fucking sad pathological lying normalized surgeon general thought right solution mask shortage? fuck. know should’ve known people stupid understand.

At time hundred cases couple dozen dead. widespread wearing mask protect actually still pretty useless.

But things changed became pandemic millions cases, point widespread mask adoption would incredibly useful. Still personal protection, helpful society large everyone it.

That’s hard stupid people understand nuance reaction “herrr derrr masks stupid” he’s tested lot wonder antibodies . Yeah it’s original name Mussel Beach, renamed couple developers back late 19th century.  tried get rapid test local urgent care used weeks ago. stock satellite locations. said manufacturer shortage, seems plausible. ended heading 30 minutes health department stand line sun 30 minutes getting test. course said 3 days would fastest turnaround long seven. (TN, btw). 

I’d say based experience, luck may factor? first time tested exact experience - walk in, get done, get result go. says lot precarious supply issues we’re facing things change dramatically week week. certainly wouldn’t discount anyone’s account able find test today’s experience. He's questioning technicality word, he's pointing used denigrating slur. Calling groups people ""illegals"" encourages mindset existence illegal, not.

Hopefully voter turnout year good. can't handle another four years. full crisis mode. Nothing shut down. Deaths actually declined peak. one talking spike cases increase deaths. We've open since Memorial.Day. 5-6 weeks. always 2 weeks nothing ever happens. keep seeing claims yet we’re still counting 30,000 new cases day counting. Seems like virus long way go sort herd immunity. makes little sense. Wearing cloth masks displace PPE, tell, instructing public wear cloth masks somehow result significant depletion medical grade equipment. done reduce spread disease, good thing public healthcare workers. would better started sooner. failure totally inexcusable. clear headline really obtuse. say ""patients"" mean positive cases.....this suggesting younger people sent hospitals.

Lol wasn’t even “purely political” statement, mods really absolute garbage copypasta one user. Flag, downvote, move ... . possible revert back dark ages? pretty much testing people hospitals covid it’s surprising everything kind lined beginning. think health care system pretty much learned based happened NYC. still don’t understand hospitals allegedly struggling badly didn’t transfer people field hospitals pretty much empty, even South Jersey hospitals. lot big bad government took away ""choice"" lifesaving safety features car option extra money opposed something comes standard matter what.

 I'm sure lots still think good idea even today go back making types things optional use install car (which would probably mean money hand car companies sell things get included today). Agree completely bro gotta admit deaths like 20-30,000 deaths United states bloated 120,000 includes people died instantly car accidents Look NY curve see happens around 25% infected.

Or look Spain UK Italy. Bergamo’s 57% extremely biased sample representative.

No matter distancing policy well public follows it, seems large drop covid growth 10-20% populations get it.

Maybe seroprevalence missing some, maybe it’s super spreaders get used first, maybe cross immunity, knows. always dramatic drop spread way earlier 70% that’s touted guess implying exactly this. positional situational awareness challenges. 
Do know are? Like exactly traffic. 
Do know 3, 6 9? I’m ptsd/vet. always know this. 

Could cut fade? Cut open airway stop bleeding? Maybe much get me. 
Shit. fade? That’s least need do.

Hopefully doctors know save people... shaking supporters hands then? meet greet? 

Nah, SS worried allow it.  must incredibly frustrating :( Im sorry. wanna see someone get Vermont via sea.. sad realize pay taxes use driver's licenses. 

They exactly government tells time. 

They want pretend horrifically debilitating, sometimes fatal virus there. Sorry meant part world. (Too much mind!). live hk used live nyc Canada. 
Good thing cases are. Good luck! mean people can’t pinpoint *where* got got from. pretty rich state I'm mathologist sure sounds like exponential growth me... Lol. Fauci, CDC, surgeon general told us January February masks helpful. think half population wants running entire healthcare system... iceberg theory? Covid Covfefe? stop stuff countries winning continuing. 

Is last generation Americas goes out?! dumb kills us? actions tell care money life. Fucking, Utah... wear magic underwear that's fucking uncomfortable literally nothing, draw line mask.

Everyone else wearing ass holes.  mean honestly yes think going overboard. wears mask hair stylist wears mask observes safety precautions fine. Can't never leave house again. Well mean guess want impose people. Progress=something advancing

Politicaly correct=something correct

White knight= knight shit Sherlock need rude. Use universal /s internet. dont read minds screen. I’m surgeon Phoenix 

Just got email tonight hospital longer allowing elective surgeries aren’t going home immediately surgery. hospital work capacity least week holding people ER. Getting tests difficult, running many places.

They mandated masks 2 days ago places. gf drove thru bar scene tonight Scottsdale, nobody wearing mask despite mandated now.

Admission numbers appear dropping delay reporting. Admissions way up. icu full trying recruit additional respiratory therapists icu docs etc go manage ventilated patients. 

Shits fucked. 

The beatings continue moral improves... explicitly say numbers I’m referring to: US wide numbers, positive tests death rate. Given elderly population Florida, lot people going die. joke idiot. National Guard supporting Special Forces detachment. lot autonomy keys buildings. Freedumbbbbb!!!! I...really hope joking problem that, way 3 months ago, wore mask America, ***people took mean already infected/sick*** that's must wearing mask - hence opening ostracization fearful suspicious looks. recently healthy people wearing masks became commonplace USA. Fortunately guy (a chef) quarantined soon Tianjing case confirmed close contact case, walking around last 10 days. I’m pro mask (at indoor public venues outdoors distancing isn’t possible) it’s really obvious that. 

Let’s say proper mask usage decreases risk spreading infection 50%. But, many people use improperly, potentially *increasing* risk (more face touching example), promoting mask usage result people socialize 3x (because essentially false sense security long they’re wearing mask). 

Those fake numbers, real promoting masks would public health disaster. actually important understand exactly benefits are, especially compared staying feet away people. Yes and? don’t make policy. lockdown still respecting rules employer private industries shop require follow. It’s called freedom thought. heard right? even, horse he's considering closing door. think that's people fleeing ""oppression,"" older moneyed stated, like: CA, NY, NJ, IL etc; interest chasing low taxes. much like Arizona areas bright read patch enraged baby boomers, lot people fleeing hope like-minded ares. Shingles, Herpes... lots lingering viruses. agree more. soooooo correct I'm 100% anti covid 19 spread. PLEASE SOMEONE, ANYONE COUGH TRUMP. 

Him entire family taking correct step perfect timeline. Steve McGarrett mess around. Oh know, literal first world problem. miss colleagues, office chit chat. also ton do, there's that. What's testing like states interest? Huh. Okay boomer. ""Sorry ma'am, son's leukemia treatment going wait, admit 45 year old guy got COVID-19 Pluckers last week"" ""some may die, sacrifice willing make.""  Source? remember hearing date well I’ve checking Norway’s border updates haven’t found date. I’m flying Norway soon border opens, literally suitcase packed ready go haha.


Edit: looks like July 1st Norway, specifically it’s open people traveling countries low levels infections.... probably Americans. Damn. Cases, important metric, important deaths. 10x higher NY. yeah Florida devil right? Unbelievable aware that's news. believe cheaper ways mass produce ethanol often amounts methanol product. specifically put really bitter unappetizing chemicals sanitizer discourage ingesting too. media calling second wave, don’t call comeback brother (18) excellent health condition, recruited college crew, lost 45lbs corona infection. Luckily much better now, still near physical condition condition before. regained weight still can't even run mile. 

Just reminder virus dangerous anyone! Please masks distance people love. Texas always bigger better prove Let's see numbers one year now.

It bit premature declare victory since easing lockdowns. Young folks lower risk, would safer go vote. (Assuming GOP continues refuse Mail-in voting) visitors? mean imagine quite lot workers NJ go NYC. It’s terrible way force people leave home. everything locked down, one going anywhere. You’re extremely disingenuous. 

It’s 2.5% protestors. It’s 2.5% protestors **that got tested**. 

You can’t compare presumed positive rate entire population Massachusetts (based portion tested?). compare actual positive rate people also got tested time period.

You’re making sense arguing bad faith. mean mass gatherings solid month noticeable spike.

Yeah yeah it’s outside wearing masks...but it’s still thousands thousands people screaming faces. would good protect people state.  Oh, protected every monkey symptoms huh. bioRxiv preprint said. Hmm. Could sworn slight suppression symptoms zero change viral load efficacy. must read wrong document 😬


Lol people. disappear, like miracle 🙂 leave door stopper someone stay room open door leave? Nice, though heard one before. Yeah, hope that’s true. I’ve reading, false negative rate PCR test 40% first 8 days *of symptomatic*, falling 20% that. sounds like *lot* false negatives. Given recent events think might better enforcers don’t check people. Head Sweden. right though.... unfortunately Natural Selection kicked curb nurture forms life, regardless survive.  


Prime Example: Teacup Dogs Swedish accounts engage harassing behavior suspicious activity patterns indicate part inorganic disinformation campaign 

Making nasty rumors opponents spreading rumors though truth another hallmark. spread social gatherings days dining reopen cases decrease. see case numbers significantly diminish, put phases reopening allow minimal activity, slowly ramp new cases continue plummet. force population wear masks times public enforce social distancing. 

The rest world seems figuring fine, many countries showing progress beating COVID-19. However, America, filled idiotic population even idiotic/cruel politicians cannot figure continue go backwards, cases rising again. sooner country stopped spreading virus, sooner went away? Whaaaaaaat?! could seen coming? also true. read study children started regressing March April height lockdown. anxiety fear see parents experiencing, sudden change routine staying home school, lack ability go outside things used traumatic affect children people think.

I know nephew started sucking thumb again. coworkers kid started sleeping bed mom dad again, kinds regression psych issues. maybe gyms offer reduced services now. Gyms exist post pandemic. Folks gotta comfortable slightly inconvenienced over. How?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously considering stopping crime taxes New York,  friends going vacation next weekend. complete shit show. months prepare, slow, stop it. We're richest country history world, we're nowhere close control. We've proven, beyond doubt, we're country fools, religious zealots, stupid countryfried rednecks would rather get sick admit might wrong. Yep would pretty easily enforceable airports, *huge* source concern. Well pandemic  genuinly wonder surge due recent protests, scary think surge hasnt even started yet. Vegas, USA Rest peace thank Well, thread didn’t age well. Trump made intentions slow testing crystal clear, “I don’t kid”. waste keystrokes this? That's normal. Antibodies stay blood large amounts, appear counter virus fade. body detects virus next time, produces antibodies.

What want ""memory cells"" detect covid-19 begin antibody production. feel way, time now. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Still sure it. Got sick March 15th fever/dry cough/headache/body aches, fever broke 29th, symptoms largely abated March 30th I've wheeze despite long term control medications ever since.

Got antibody test end April, negative. Doctor told believe test skews threshold giving negative people rather false positives, social distance anyways.

Tried get nasal/brain swabbed March, first week get fever 101.8F instead second week preserving COVID testing entering hospitals determine care symptoms severe enough require hospitalization. response 10x better. 

100% incorrect. initial seeding disease 10x lower FL. ""response"" robust NYC, practically nonexistent FL. Time continue show that, cases continue spike FL worse NY levels. northeast back normal Texas shuts down. reduce strain hospitals, save lives. 

But seems somewhat sure Armageddon every cities i.c.u. sacrifice gammy gumbpa economy... 

*waves pom poms deaths easier count, right? mean could test bodies. Can't really count undetected. see point checking fatalities seems like results would easier count. Two weeks ago, broke arm.

My last fortune cookie message ""Welcome Change"".

I'm sure make it. Damn must clean surfaces. Long lines indoor dining. No, prevents cytokine storm. given every confirmed case. side effect profile completely safe inline HCQ others.  moved Texas California required quarantine 14 days. 2 special agents come house check complying. Kinda topic mods banned comment yesterday saying idiotic stop counting ICU patients critical condition. sub's mods really need get shit together. Logically, there’s way enforce it—who investigating scofflaws? get tickets? go court?

I’m really sad home state (Maine); government business owners no-win situation. I’m hoping hard gains treatment knowledge, however small, reduce mortality rate some. guess we’ll see shortly. Here’s hoping. idea true numbers who’s following people didn’t need hospitalized never even got test? know least one person it, never able get tested, months later still trouble lung capacity. don’t data say whether 30% over- under-estimation. We’re supposed go work yet suddenly ready drop lives weeks dime able isolate immediately time.  

Meanwhile companies many us work need immediate government assistance they'll go bankrupt. lol

Not American. never heard older, ""muh freedom"" type rant forced wear seatbelt? dad frequently did, sometimes went without knew cops nearby. Rhymes joke case CDC, think came discovered covid transmitted via asymptomatic presymptomatic carriers (look supporting studies bottom page). seem based actual efficacy availability masks. No, can't, first social distance properly wear fucking masks people even that.

And stop acting like year, most, rest lives. Make uncomfortable sacrifices better future. mean great news thousands others recovered weeks even months life support. made mistake buying jeans one size small. Can't return em lol case alone, case numbers would still high, deaths not. Link doesn’t work me. Thank you. is, everyone hospital great job stayed bare minimum afterwards too. skipped appointments near end limit exposure. Hopefully won't, surprised considering São Paulo bigger pop New York. Happy see progress NY rough start That's small gym limited class sizes. can't compare normal weight room without instructor. one thing, dangerous perform lifts without spotter. another, people walking away equipment sets drink water common. Yes, know water bottles exist, solve spotter problem. nonconventional gyms like martial arts studios, climbing gyms, hot yoga like.

Cubicles work blanket solution.

And rest comment? Online classes younger grades set back children lower income households significantly may recover. Students pay tuition take online classes universities.. earth point watch lectures online read textbooks free, unless going regulated field degree required people?

As restaurants limited capacity, that's fine temporary phased reopening measure restaurants can't really operate remain profitable half capacity, I'm sure know.

Wearing masks restaurants eating sensible long-term measure suggested. Lol, realize mostly catch people they're blatantly aggressively posting locations photos social media? really hard enforce apparently, get lucky dumbasses violate quarantine also dumb enough keep telling everyone so. governor handled COVID worst going try push blame States. literally delete order put COVID patients nursing homes led many deaths.

He sucks. Since upper recommend dosage 4000 I'd rather take less 4000 since food maybe fortified vitamin D. current habit taking 5000 IU every day works me. believe caught back March antibodies. Still, would good wear one set example. starting number 41 sites, 13 remain operation across five states. addition Texas’ seven, Illinois New Jersey two, Colorado Pennsylvania one. infects kills them. reproduce course infecting immune cells way HIV does. Courtesy Jim Bakker. US, blame GOP. completely fucking incompetent. United States somewhat unique encouraging people ""get tested case,"" 

Ontario Canada thing. I've seen billboards government ads going ""Think covid? Get tested."" testing capability something like 27,000 day. we're getting maybe 200 positives day so. Multinational corporations absolutely got more. Ugh stink Even India long back quarantining people states people travel good reason states. surprising sad America handling this. Welp, that's official now. List countries signed produce Oxford vaccine
 
-UK 
-US 
-India 
-EU coalition 
-Egypt 
-Brazil Gotta keep teargas would mean fatality rate lower? Serious question, understand. people infected number deaths drive rate? Goalposts havent moved. US state, including California, took seriously.

But CA take things less seriously say, NJ. NJ made masks mandatory April, California last week. NJ opened outside dining curbside retail last week. CA opened weeks ago. forgot add quick recovery. completely agree rest sentiment  It’s bars parties. tons friends testing positive furrowed brow. Neat. 

Mandating masks shouldn’t controversial political everyone. Thank saying that. head know right call hate disappoint people hard emotionally. work ""42343 new cases"" work Google must partially hoax /s Thanks, that’s one. Must see. Number one trick skip quarantine Hawaii. EMTs hate it. Covid statisticians love it. Fauci told people wear mask. Turns told shortage masks medics needed most.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Taiwan did:

* stockpile masks accumulated decade
* Released part said stock Chinese New Year, mask factories closed, prevent price gouging
* Requested mask factories return full production ASAP help military
* Banned exports masks
* Expropriated mask production centrally distributed
* Created system rationing distribution masks
* Set aside US$6 million emergency funds purchase equipment 60 mask production lines abroad, given mask producers exchange equivalent value masks.

All above, *before end January*.

Interestingly though, masks mandatory April, new mask production lines came online reasonable amount masks available distribution (roughly 5 every 14 days per person). populace mostly wearing masks public anyhow. clever people dead sent rocket Moon ...Hannah Montana could better job...? ... cockwombles.. throw mask wearing ... cheap, easy ... makes look bit stupid fearful though. fLu bRo Surprise surprise... embarrassingly small crowd, crowd. Indoors. masks. Hollering cheering shoulder shoulder. likely super spreader event. Agreed that’s consistently dropping two months now. It’s less 30% peak. people make stock market dead people. Dead people sell, whatever crash. Tougher actions exactly? People done hypocrisy, whether Abbott one it. capable of, people willing go lockdown again, anything even particularly close it. already unconstitutional, allowed happen bc told responsible needed slow virus. sudden matter anymore. ridiculous see months staying home suffering many ways country diminished people instantaneously deciding longer need social distance

I'm firm believer social distancing wearing masks around people. Stop events, outdoor indoor, thousands tens thousands people gathering. insulting us allowed constitutional rights limited greater good country. “ug” means microgram, per paper cited: active, “therapeutic dose” Sorry. I'm thick..

You need spell Fox News network people. pointing poor suffer CNN desperately tries cover up.. always bothered ""millennials"" ones born 2000. know, new millennium. I’m going say people might agree, said warning needs go out. 

People want college football happen economics universities. 

Colleges Universities telling students going school normal minor modifications schedule. likely lie want keep students taking year stay financially stable. 

I predicting colleges universities send students home end September beginning October finish year virtually. 

Colleges Universities going become hotspots Covid kids social distancing living dorms/frat houses. can’t, it’s many people establishment time making sure facility big enough social distance constantly sanitizing everything. max capacity 50 people 15 25 people allowed time. there’s space distance safely pull mask eat drink. Really Pandemic drinking liquor bars shouldn’t allowed since people can’t handle liquor they’re infected could infect others getting space starting fights. American govt afford bail corporations tune trilliond, support people time without collapse quite certain. imagine it’s lot confounding factors. Like compared B.C. vs Quebec, I’m sure would’ve thought B.C. would’ve hit harder. combination mask wearing acceptable B.C., health minister experience working SARS outbreak, later spring break added I’m sure. could riots protests state, cases skyrocketing deaths aren't. mean sre testing more? month since deaths gone up. 

It's hitting young people actually get tested now. average age dropping like crazy infected. people typically accessible test.

It's one.  accurate used 76k probably ballpark given states 15-20% positive rate. Arizona it’s close 50% cases past 2 weeks.  really believes testing reason theres many corona cases. hes probably hoarding gallons plasma prevent illness pretending everything fine. correct No, really, given new, nobody going cry 'wolf' retract. Definitely extent would mattered anywhere world, evidenced Asia NZ control, despite earlier cases compared Europe America.

I accept counterfactual. mean, we're pretty much 2 Vietnams right  Ssshh... supposed hope things. OK AZ know blame spikes happen. two weeks two weeks rise cases started beginning June? deaths decreasing cases plateaued? still waiting two weeks cases? logic? less hosts infect virus theorized mutated lesser threatening version....An Italian medical professional cited die end year rate find bullshit Canadian here..

Good luck guys. president adminstration, healthcare system, good portion society whole massively failed here. rest world learn lesson do.

I sincerely hope low death tolls possible economic recovery guys. Remember vote October. Yes. huge difference opposite end stick, relationship times suck. opportunity meet date someone might year away. Deaths lagging indicator, people likely die weeks 3-4 weeks 1-2 diagnosis broadly speaking.

However:

The death rate also goes broadly speaking testing increases (picking cases range severity rather picking severe cases).

The death rate also goes broadly speaking capacity improves treatments improve. Oh look, month Memorial Day weekend spikes country. Nothing see people, move along.

It's protests. Month way long numbers rise. think science there, yet. actually prophylactic virus. Even did, anti-viral medications pretty serious side effects. always cite wiki scoured wiki, seen sort meaningful definition. useless pontification ""difference policy politics"" *not* defined certainly applied look everything front page. selective enforcement - like said, they'll label ""politics"" remove it. Okay... show you’re certain confers lasting immunity, thought saw lot articles last couple weeks suggesting immunity might apply one single strain, may last months. Maybe economic system broken means stupendously wealthy get traipse pandemic Fox News thinks poor starve streets. point nobody knows bet would like Smaug dragon. I'm shocked area hit hard. Nobody taking precautions. Naw bro get joking.

Obvious /s oh gosh, posts calling moron okay dare mention ""re-election"" y'all loose minds. complacency isn’t cities US. complacency among rural areas suburbs previously part first wave. Chicago almost fully reopened (with capacity restrictions) Friday cases low there’s near universal mask usage. went home Oklahoma thought virus fake. point let learn hard way tbh we’ve done everything get care won’t. That’s got dumbest rule sub too. Actions responses COVID almost entirely based party lines. pro disease party pro public health party negligible levels cross over. cry 90%...yep, nothing worry Captain SS Titanic Sounds like living Canadian dream, eh? real things going states say is, ... - - - ... Really fucked. I'm person wears mask job. Oh let work remote. said wash hands. going attract sea unpleasant comments we'll spend evening taking locking thread hour's time - sorry. get fucking deserve people could already breathing, time hear cough sneeze it’s late Article 6 weeks old see mean able argue way. However tracing testing contain pandemic, neither leadership shown interest doing. thing gone completely rails it’s becoming even apparent failures news like comes out. Well every single virologist must wrong. I’ll make sure tell epidemiologists universally disagree someone online barely spell hurrdurr know real truth. get degree? don’t need speak. Bye. 

Blocked. thought flu mutates quickly vaccine last compared that, fact get cumulative benefits time shot. far remember reading covid mutating much compared flu. would assume don’t wear mask? pro mask. put seat belt drive maintain brakes. also wear mask appropriate. anti-shut exception localities hospital beds close running out. memorial day weekend incubation period sure fuck seems pretty long huh? two four? dont know Yup. roof. good day. Haha. feel shoes comment. also friends comment - I've seeing people parks distanced picnics lot. Staying home forever gonna work. one saw coming. one predicted spikes. one said Texas much soon.

They've one friend multiple times got tested waited negative results visits! Ireland anecdotal reports meat factory workers taking medicine lower temperature they'd get past temp check going work. lot clusters factories here, I'm sure place though.

I can' imagine would happen factories closed shelves empty supermarkets. true, particularly supermajority truly evil GOPers GA. However, say Gov. Cooper (D) Dr. Mandy Cohen DHHS truly held public outcry people's hair getting long abs getting toned. Cooper begun Phase 2 based data, he'll pull back needs to. approved Raleigh's order require face masks anywhere social distancing possible. Currently Raleigh rise hospitalizations. primary culprits capital time defined 25-49...Glenwood South huge hotspot people mingle/flirt/PDA, reflection infection lead infections people susceptible threats disease.

Last heard country founded ""life, liberty, pursuit happiness."" think life first accident. can't two dead. earlier projections deaths used WH turned badly inaccurate predicted less 100k deaths together (which trump boasted recall couple weeks ago). doubt anti virals, I’m pretty sure probably received plasma containing antibodies. There’s way could see brazen public April early May, 30k positive tests per day meant roughly 600k infections per day lack testing capacity.

Now, infection rate gone way down, testing rate quite bit. We’re catching maybe one third infections.

The number deaths mostly tracks real infection rate (improvements treatment protocols marginal - any).  Masks pretty rare SWMO. Restaurants bars open. can't say I'm surprised all. Well depends people going Memphis party coming suburbs. takes one person start spreading virus suburb night bar hopping. ""JuSt StARt sUb"" /s

So sick tired excuse - splintering new subs never worked. People need place meaningful discussion new relates virus, right /r/coronavirus largest forum world topic 2 million subscribers. alternatives sub racist name, loony bin convince virus exist. desperately need reliable public health information open discourse can't here. 

I wish Reddit would take freaking banner front page, ""KEEP SAFE INFORMED VISIT /R/CORONAVIRUS"". users contribute content keep people informed, ones running show abusing authority control conversation silence criticism. Someone told authority never used club. 350 centered around southwest missouri

It's probably meat packing plant. worrisome. expected. trend going towards closing opening next weeks. testing. ‘rona. pandemic. assuming one lives “hotspot” area, it’s small, say “town”. Would considered airborne enough people about? Stupid question probably curious. I'm expert, take comments grain salt. virus spreads based 'viral load' - sheer amount virus particles period time. get exposed little bit every weeks (grocery shopping everyone wears masks), probably going problem healthy immune system. constantly exposed lot (singing church / shouting work, recirculating air), that's bad.

In winter, people gather less smaller (good!), sealed indoors (bad!). Less UV light (bad). on. think necessarily better worse seasonally, I'm sure we'll find later. Regardless, would minimize exposure wear mask.

The migrants over, can't practice social distancing well, interact lot people, natural growth risk. Wtf? Yeah Michigan seems okay too. Meaning gigantic hoax start. Remember riots told ""But want kill grandma. you?"" Remember that? Yeah, city's pretty responsible...but I'd still say 50-60% people wearing masks consistently, going whole lot get big sample size either.

They still let grocery store without mask though virus infections double every so-many days unscientific, Epidemiology 101. Texas shut again. Period. would stake every cent fact. Idk. get that... we're going buffer numbers make look good god awful job it? inread article saying virus mutating point deadly March....

of course, due social distancing efforts.../which longer much....

which means knows new cases go NOBODY WANTS YOU. majority 1st world gained control virus. year American tourists welcome sucks man, 2 weddings supposed go August postponed next year. Weddings fun event bride groom, feel :( realize surge capacity make shift ICU rooms non ICU staff? Also, look timeline hospitalizations...8 consecutive days new records hospitalization Texas. worth, work there...we nearing NYC status blaming cities things get hand. Take responsibilities, accept credit. Normally I'd agree unconditionally statements like these, keep mind money create guns bombs ex-nihilo. money suddenly chasing bombs favor chasing bread actually buy exactly money's worth bread, there's many bakers it'd take time bomb-makers switch become bakers, switch happens all. really address point; just, moreso generalized sentiment.

As fo point, note food waste alone sufficient; amount military money form military trucks taking wasted food redistributing need probably reasonably doable small amount time. may sound sterotypical riots going global pandemic country issue, media. mental gymnastic want, change drank Kool Aid. better way. Europe it.

Get dead ass start gov. Get laws place, better late sorry right? Get mask social distancing laws place support them.

lol! spout unacceptable like grade math people chastising them. So, want MORE/HIGHER scores what?

You people state trying best can, great sacrifice, running amok.

YOU gov. Fix it! April 1st... Surprise MF!!! (Insert vine) mean could get tested 40 different places within 15 minute drive 5 minutes. make appointment show time line wait. got antibody blood draw swabbed last week singed online made appointment 45 minutes later 5 min, even drew blood car. Part thinks ever caught it, flu, another part thinks can't ever admit exists base continue deny existence. Funny. comment got deleted. here’s proof. Censorship much. get that, people do. wear masks, social distance, etc, more? Lockdowns over, people privy fear-mongering already people 'run hot' too? may resting body temp slightly higher nominal value falsely given 'fever' value? usual cutoff COVID-19 38.0 C / 100.4 F, right? high enough catch everyone running fever - including people run hot? might rock world, ""America"" win American War Independence.

It British, French backed German mercenaries fought war.

The French handed country land owning rich Americans.  abbott accepts possibility, cases rise expected it’s “unacceptable”. fucking joke spelled P-E-R-G-A-N-T-E! Let's hope case ask got traveled around US Asian countries.  Rent bill freezes alongside strict lockdown enacted January. 2 week quarantine anyone flying country unnecessary travel halted. Masks anyone needing grocery shop essential work. Choke virus pour money power vaccine development. Resources like grocery delivery rolled mass, bonus salary anyone working essential jobs. strict example would set tone around world would same. call Trump failure. could saved hundreds thousands. Every day avoid strict measures means thousands dead. Saturday 13 hour wait time Phoenix area test! two months off, loved every minute family. I’m back work, spending every night hotel. Looking new job now. remember results seeing today actions taken 2-3 weeks ago. 

The number people infected today much larger, possibly even multiple, number tested positive today. Good, let entire administration catch it. quit job lowes, western kentucky. worked temp since beginning Feb, literally covering every new case covid employees came first case attracted local press. less 3 times sweep infected employees rug tell people potentially exposed. enforce wearing masks, stopped door counts (against CDC guidelines) left week ago looked back. Piss poor management around. Probably Ocean Beach San Diego American century ended 2000 lol. It’s telling assume approve rioting and/or looting.
I don’t.

These High School students deserve celebrate!
While safely wear masks (most protestors did).

While people protesting things life &amp; death,
these students simply flexing selfish need praise
using excuse cover hanging friends.

Just another example irresponsible behavior privileged people
who raised believe whatever fuxx want. Still need protect animals Corona not!!!!  get caught want go jail? Memphis city council executive branch bunch fools Looking UK now, I'm sure.

On personal standpoint, mother acquaintance recovered NYC feels invincible due antibodies. Church, flying, etc without worry. I’m entirely convinced Disney really intends open. They’re dummies lawsuits COVID victims risk too. closed government forced too. closed huge event made everyone Florida sit ups pay attention pandemic. Oh bad. Extra peaches you. Yep! live suburbs Vegas everyone blame tourists casinos spike go pick food times I’m person mask one social distancing. Got glares yesterday risking life people look weird. can, usually doesn't. See paper today: Wish could find similar thread /r/politics could make actual comment story. Even there’s lockdown, one follow attended protests primary concern. find hard believe people people wearing masks walking close proximity protests didn’t contribute all. I'm one posted originally -17 score. guy may troll (or jot) genuinely curious kids think. I'd bet younger kids love teenagers even preteens, many may going crazy missing friends. Man need get FOXNEWS. gaslit real hard buddy. would think so. hitting us face STILL FUCKING GET IT. disappointed people. People considered intelligent, reasonable people. beyond frustrating, disheartening, depressing. I'm that's bullshit, I'm sorry hear :(. think medical field could get people wear masks easier say grocery store.

I live Pinellas County next Hillsborough company's offices located Tampa (Hillsborough County) 95 percent us WFH right now. 

Stay strong Texan friend :) Toddler working retail?

Lack education trying pay school? lot states mandatory masks still locked though. seems important. Yeah. study suspicious clearly massive increases patients hospitals. 

Also, massive deaths (eg Spain, France, Italy, Brazil). Huh. weird cold mid January. could that, cold, certainly wasn’t progressing symptoms like typical cold me. early May antibody year negative. But, infected January, late April antibodies may gone.

The larger issue everyone could susceptible virus multiple times, years. makes developing vaccine even important. number disturbing itself, add fact theres large group people give fuck hurts soul, keep calling staying open. Look 9/11 andit massive fraction people died, oh 120,000 people die people can't bothered wear mask. sickens little compassion seem others nowadays. can't surprised result though... love kids. definitely bonded family. I’m lucky mine play with. feel sorry anyone children. would extremely hard. Ocean Beach wait 5 days??? got tested cali got results less 24 hours! sure glad don’t live arizona... There's reason continue stay lockdown know virus nowhere near deadly first believed. It’ll cause uptick GDP people come party socialize. employment. It’s temporary open gone far people failed maintain distancing masking discipline cases climb steeply. numbers watch whether get point hospitals ventilators overwhelmed beyond capacity. That’s people pay attention. warning heeded now. believe story worldwide flood might interested ... wonder get closer Disney second thoughts reopening. Given everything open, amount new cases continue rise. optics Disney opening middle surge cases awful. national media them. 

I'm wondering possibility delay reopening August/September. sadly lot people anti-science anti-intellectualism. half-baked theory (at least people) intimidated intelligent, science-minded people. don’t understand science basic facts people try tell things high-and-mighty, snobby, jerks. Ocean Beach, San Diego. ""Campus Crusaders"", changed name. groups apparently cool, christain group ends using kids go work states/areas, convince *other* kids work join, taking money. kid worked would tell they'd tell try find lonely, depressed kids easier recruit. Told try figure liked, learn bit match them. Create ""really cool"" meetups promise lot, actually set things (can't waste donation money), say work people got there.

All all, would try manipulate younger kids join up, plus huge asshole younger brother. younger brother bit weird awkward kid, bad means, anything deserve treatment brother gave him.

I'm sure Cru AKA Campus Crusader's groups chill, one complete cult, like organization that's trying take money young kids, especially cancel college entire semesters can't afford along donations. 

Just google them, along ""Brainwashing"" ""Manipulation"", there's tons stories I've found reddit matching exact stuff coworker told me. Like, even told this, proudly, fucked.

Edit: Here's two them. find more, apparently well known fucked group, eh, glad word spreading, avoid costs, money hungry try seperate kids non-Cru groups website ""Is God worth losing family?"". teach young kids, fuck Anne, Christ-follower comes worth fighting for,” says. “Even disowned ten billion times, it. want cling Jesus. promised us hundred times [as much blessing] leave family.”

But know, they're quoted say shit like word 'cult' inflammatory thrown around loosely completely unfair totally unfounded,"" Mr. Fridley said. ""Things accused of, like mind control turning members families, absolutely spirit Jesus God."" 

This NY Times article. revolutionary war potentially applicable answer. Well damn, I'm convinced Phoenix come! well, possibly rethinking date reopening places wearing mask difficult mind sort statistical correction increased testing types headlines, all...

Headline makes sound like Covid exploding yet portion testing increases CA still opening economy this. right moment Northern California news channel blaring re-opening, etc etc mandatory masks matter. CA like last week. cities tries implement it... get backlash antivaxer shitfucks. 


  


  


Just take look states masks made mandatory end may current infection rate. ignoring fact nationwide protests three weeks people side side, wearing masks, screamed, chanted etc. older CEO got it, fever one day minor lingering cough. 7 people household one exact reaction. minimal, quick recovery. downplay extent better understand side spectrum. friend co worker got hospitalized late virus, ended dying. (He overweight pre existing condition). careful, PERIOD. Meaning gigantic hoax start. 

I guess 473,000 deaths crisis actors. Makes sense, since Hollywood Broadway closed down, actors needed jobs. true assume people nothing sheep.

I understand people think need ""leader"" order put fuckin' mask face. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean National School Tropical Medicine Baylor College Medicine, predicted weekend Houston brink disaster based latest trends increasing ""My observations trajectory persists: 1) Houston would become worst affected city US, maybe rival we're seeing Brazil 2) masks = good 1st step simply enough 3) would need proceed red alert,"" Hotez Houston region alone, number confirmed suspected patients intensive care unit beds leapt 80%, 273 Memorial Day 506 Saturday, according Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council. **The current increase cases could exceed hospital intensive care units' capacity two weeks greater Houston area**, according data gathered Texas Medical Center. - went walking trail yesterday lot people walk. 50 groups, 3 wearing masks counted. Others jogging/running breathing really hard right next people. Really annoying. older people roll eyes us even one commented ""Jeeesus!"" looking family maybe responded something daughter said him. wife went high school graduation party past weekend (I strongly objected this) niece graduating. Well, morning gets text aunt saying one person house party Friday tested positive covid. wife went testing center morning get rapid test (15 minutes get results back) came back negative. soon know may contracted it? I’ve read rapid test efficient, accurate? wife, kids go get tested later week wait longer sure don’t it? Thanks advance. Meanwhile people protested re-open thought demonized media (different areas required varying levels lockdown practices, also see every county state reopening based situation) Levels antibody found recovered COVID-19 patients fell sharply 2-3 months infection symptomatic asymptomatic patients, according Chinese study, raising questions length immunity novel coronavirus.

The research, published Nature Medicine June 18, highlights risks using COVID-19 ‘immunity passports’ supports prolonged use public health interventions social distancing isolating high-risk groups, researchers said. 

Health authorities countries Germany debating ethics practicalities allowing people test positive antibodies move freely others don’t. 

The research, studied 37 symptomatic patients 37 asymptomatic patients, found tested positive presence IgG antibody, one main types antibodies induced infection, 90% showed sharp declines 2-3 months. 

The median percentage decrease 70% symptomatic asymptomatic patients. 

For neutralising serum antibodies, median percentage decrease symptomatic individuals 11.7%, asymptomatic individuals 8.3%. 

The study conducted researchers Chongqing Medical University, branch Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention institutes. 

Jin Dong-Yan, virology professor University Hong Kong part research group, said study negate possibility parts immune system could offer protection. 

Some cells memorize cope virus first infected muster effective protection second round infection, said. Scientists still investigating whether mechanism works new coronavirus. 

“The finding paper doesn’t mean sky falling,” said, also noting number patients studied small. “Christian Nation” arse. lets hope reopen smart. people still think ""hoax"". Morons. mothers? type 3 number combination google followed “new cases” news article every single one top listed.

hmm...yes.... numbers comment...like 86% math. Look tmc page says icu capacity projected exceeded within 2 weeks So, Gavin, state far along reopening process? protests political. wearing mask, thanks trump. comment stands. „uRgH cAnT bræTh!?!“

Please someone remove people existence Let's say did. Yeah, doubt. Hospitals hide PPE seized accused using much leader. real life? know what’s worse hundreds thousands people going one time large events? Hundreds *millions* people repeatedly small social interactions every single day. 

Big events aren’t good idea pandemic, MANY opportunities infection normal day day life EVERYONE takes part it. need correlate cases vs hospitalization. case numbers might coming increased testing. need know many positives wind stressing hospitals. Increased testing may reveal people virus significantly sick it. hospitalization start spiking we’ll know we’re deep shit. We’ll know within next couple weeks bad it’s getting that’s average lag time infection needing hospitalization. California good example. Numbers going hospitalizations yet. testing finding people already infected? Or, virus going control? going lot infections...especially due lack following guidelines increased testing. key is, many gonna wind morgue. talking yet said absolutely nothing. county (n. virginia) kids 10 19 suddenly become largest group cases: 28%. friend japan whose 56 days. Posting Facebook days fever thinking recovery getting another fever. Still taste. country test say know want Olympics go ahead want people think cases do. Much like trump said. test numbers lower either mandate masks 🤦‍♂️ Horse out, best get barn door shut. Why, exactly, matter? read article? Jesus. still business? good way kill bunch people! Yet. Jesus, think hospital tab that. *had* good job surging right now. plenty states took seriously flattened curve. Florida opposite end spectrum. Imagine thinking country 330 million people governed 50 separate entities get rid highly contagious virus wearing masks Yeah, I'd rather die seen Plus, average age getting much lower, least that’s case Florida. Now, think see spread older populations eventually (which terrible) think that’s deaths low now. Especially government you’re right government forgot Coronavirus could completely see saying want keep health life you’ll pay vaccine insurance likely crazy copayment straight pocket. Let’s hope doesn’t come though. hope vaccine come safe there’s long term consequences receiving it. I’ve going out, indoors packed people. Nice mountain hikes walks beach, sort thing.  inread article saying virus mutating point deadly March....

This would extremely new surprising discovery, since RNA polymerase coronavirus encodes genome proof-reading mechanism prevents single-nucleotide mutations happening. result, RNA virus remarkably stable. 

The reason there's fewer deaths know treat patients better testing allows us know patients need treatment earlier.

Good times! study showed normal immune response.

Free floating antibodies long infection immune disorder chronic infection. Memory B cells save configuration antibodies quickly make mass amounts upon re-infection. Along killer cells compplex system allow time (about day) antibodies produced lympatic system new infection easily halted.

Continued presences anti-bodies leads immune issues inflamitory issues due fact 100% specific (which tests use concentration indicator)

Covid bad enough. tring spin it. Yep, April 06 last (and other) 30k+ Monday. don’t think anyone point. 

It likely something people densely populated areas longer, risk getting sick higher. may something always required traveling, transit, hospitals, etc. 

The answer you’re probably looking would “when vaccine”. there’s telling could be. Let's completely ignore media second look facts.

1. many areas numbers cases, percent positive testing rate, hospitalization rate increasing record levels.

2. virus go away own, people's behavior needs change want slow spread (not counting herd immunity since we're far levels needed that).

3. COVID without doubt top 3 causes death month April, excess death statistics suggest may #1 killer.

What think done? genuine question, I'm trying see coming beliefs.

Edit: assume anything, realize lockdowns economically politically unfeasible US right now, trying get discussion Elders lived, learned, wise mistakes witnessed

Our ""elders"" grew unique situation rest world fucking destroyed WW2 able convert oxygen carbon dioxide make life. don’t get downvoted obvious sarcasm wore mask traveling work late January. Man, people Orange County.. Good response long. Next time say carrying mutated lizard plague 5G chip you. Yes. feel like immunity may happen ever. miss friends. miss drink bar.

I’m screwed... lightbulb guess. never come supply crunch doctors nurses. knew masks effective, unethical mislead public order reserve supplies doctors nurses, even forced decision poor planning White House. American news outlets/celebrity doctors need masks, superior. They'd chances getting sick wear masks not. I'm trying understand related backbend logic game trying play. nothing protests last weeks right? Standing crowds thousands people nothing this. Right?? ""omg cover face holes!"" personal theory air conditioning systems enclosed spaces incubator. I’ve taken similar measures yours, assure you’re one thinks this. It’s airborne. Fuck i’m wearing think might people thinking wearing masks protect thinking virus rich environment e.g. hospitals. 

If case, really worry mask sitting really tight right, touching anything etc. Also people lot worried smear transference than.

Now wearing masks self protection protecting others. rules different. Whatever breath go mostly mask stay there. outside mask going saturated virus people around wearing them, too. touching mask etc. bad anymore breath goes beside mask big infection risk everyody else wearing one well. Denmark good trace. none really. Testing really good now, slow start up. Isolate at-home. Hmm, maybe sort correlation places willing host him, large coronavirus numbers, large numbers supporters trump aren’t taking pandemic seriously? remember something (I might misremembering sorry) Pence saying said don’t need masks initially, didn’t want people going buying masks hospitals short PPE. still think bullshit. Didn’t CDC tell us wear masks first? I'm lazy great blending. 2 around. Here's story hospital go extraordinary measures protect shipment masks seized Federal Government.  So, apparently, Federal Government believed authority direct masks going.     

But time issuing bad mask advice, federal government that. Could empowered, correct advice could given public. time New York lot trouble. It’s false equivalency

It's not. way COVID spreads flu, masks specifically designed limit diffusion. Asian countries already adopted flu (even high density cities, like Tokyo example) cases deaths general obvious determined wearing masks. tonight, 11 Growing north Louisiana (natchitoches) thought people south sane ones. Glad got peaced Chicago many years ago. agree, people consuming fish tank cleaner ingesting bleach sitting tub hand sanitizer doesn’t sound far fetched days. No, don’t exist. experience Montgomery County PA too. Legitimately best schools country. rural counties PA? Schools terrible comparison, public schools intercity Philadelphia even worse. Meanwhile “Texas Tough” must mean “I’m real fuckin tough, don’t need mask.” see long capacity? Click ICU tab look blue line, follow date back. said ""through roof."" I'm sick ppl saying stuff like this. true feeds breeds unnecessary fear. Hospitals saying ""shows concern."" 

I guess we'll see two weeks. 

Remindme! 2 weeks 

Normal ICU occupancy without pandemic reference restaurants open, people excited I'm seeing lots babies car seats going restaurants w adults. Obviously kids 2 cant wear mask. even adults masked, unmasked kid spreads it... actually understand grandpa's point view. easy us (younger people) say try preserve limited time 84, significant passed away, seen things want see one would start question that? point run things look forward takes toll body observe. patients held ICU longer critical, simply observation. patients gray area ready move floors critical condition. said, he's suggesting patients counted. reason. stick room 2 hours grilling you...

It's job defend politicians. They're friends. employed us ask. job review performance fire non-performers.

It's job sing praises. Outline link: I'm guessing putting lot deaths complication caused virus rather virus keep numbers low. think “the young people ones getting shouldn’t worry” next talking point repeat. Constitutionally speaking, that’s valid justification. It’s also possible conduct religious services outside. lot southwest Missouri work northwest Arkansas. NWA break right now. two pretty much lumped together realistically.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* would say impression China stays 10 years ago. something quite impressive pandemic. even used drones Wuhan regularly check temperatures residents quarantined apartment buildings. current daily testing capacity Beijing 1 million. face bigger challenge due population density, also tools deal challenge. didn’t bother read it

Sounds like 99% comments r/coronavirus  people fucking irredeemable assholes reply going answer question?  Two weeks.  Oh aren’t concerned that. shut abortion clinics. pregnant women live, created plenty replacements. (I wish joking heard them) assume didn’t read entire article... too.

How turn tables.  Yeah people eat drink lot protests, amongst things. Well stop testing then!  guess, commitment attention span five year old. He’s like tRump’s Mini Me. F’ing idiots. wonder long/of brains finally kick things aren’t getting better... That's happens open early folks Latinos. non-floridian surprised hear this. obviously found day day hospitalization chart specifically COVID19. going down. 16% looking overall ICU hospitalizations, COVID19. Math Abbott’s specialty. eight new cases today NYC. Eight. cases spiked widespread protests. went absolute worst place country one best. Bullshit article justifying past actions. Also, complete nonsense. 60 day lockdown eradicate virus, resets day 2-3month prior. good luck enforcing this. would apply repubs protesting open businesses then, right? increase spread whatsoever. I’m Philly Jersey frequently everyone see wearing masks almost religiously. Seen multiple people kicked establishments wearing them. really bad places?  It’s good Trump knows he’s invincible he’s got best genes Plus 2 whoopie cushions fart spray  predictable outcome based human nature--people take things seriously unless lives directly jeopardized.

We inevitably headed towards Italy NY type scenario, except long, dragged version frequent ""spikes"" ""relapses"" people (and therefore virus) travel back forth coastal inland regions, time likely mutating enough may negate immunity built previous waves.

Brace yourselves, winter coming. Let’s coy, Florida barely shutdown all, Texas too. doors flew wide open echos done reverberating, nobody careful. what’s happening now: See like [the better? definitely liberal bent (especially comments)... KSL owned church they’ve clearly got agenda. surprise want downplay abject failures state federal administrations. read both, record.

Lol thank Pointing battle addiction hope makes feel better. I’m saying illegal immigrants bad people, don’t hard life. friends illegally. end day they’re illegally, sure I’ll call undocumented sake. means shit. came say something similar. governor said press conference last week increase appears troublesome, point every new case discovered contact tracing. Plus prior agreement state lab almost impossible get tested unless hospitalized. city offers free testing 3x/week asymptomatic citizens. Rt depends individual contact rate. lockdown ends, Rt goes 1, unless disease eradicated (which isn't). Omg! Oh safe really hope nothing. not

Watch got doctor empirical evidence here. else declare offhandedly increase spread? ""open businesses now"" protests? Wait sorry helped spread evillllllll repubs Lol - did?!? Again, presenting coming special place privilege don’t think Americans aren’t struggling getting access food. Many Americans struggling beforehand, crisis definitely putting large burden food-assistance programs. I’m wrong, I’m pretty sure one first steps starvation hunger lol. Malnutrition, food deficiency, yes, starvation occur, statistics won’t fully know over. America won’t see largest increase compared nations, definitely jump. **Wait Don’t..**

Edit: /s Jesus, put here? Better treatments+lower median age+contact tracing+virus mutation=lower CFR thyroid risk factor covid? Sorry hear you’re away family, really sucks. Kansas quarantine, least I'm at, seemed like suggestion anything. people it, others didn't, never heard penalties anyone.

That said, new cases seem control back maybe enough, right definitely look like going up, hope turn Arizona soon, see considering everyone looks back normal. What's gonna ? Give virus stern talking ? Source? Fair enough, pull finish strong!! I'm waiting possible foot surgery that's postponed whenever MRI possible unlikely pituitary tumor. ‘making facts’ literally claiming covid hospitalizations decreasing Arizona. Despite fact link sent page specifically shows covid-like-Illnesses rise attributed 16.1% hospitalizations. record setting rate state never seen anything close that.

You’re misleading you’re claiming covid hospitalizations aren’t rising Arizona despite site linked literally proving otherwise.

82% highest end ICU capacity, according source linked. 80% middle pandemic may “normal” doesn’t mean isn’t bad. Especially considering increase hospitalizations, know, thing conveniently deny

Let guess, Arizona? tried convince public masks weren’t needed regular people mask shortage US great needed every mask could get medical staff.

China didn’t announce first COVID-19 death four days later. DeLap’s Feb. 1 funeral service, frightening stories deadly new virus Wuhan dominated news.

“Everybody knew talking started would say, ‘Do think died that?’” Cortez said.

“And said, ‘I don’t know.’”

She still doesn’t.

Preserved samples DeLap’s lungs among tissue 40 California deaths waiting decision U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention whether test COVID-19. Orange County nine cases, Los Angeles County. Kern County identified two respiratory deaths might suggest COVID-19, young women, one died Dec. 21. Well, .25% NYC’s population *already died* covid, that’s IFR floor: can’t lower unless something weird population (and actually somewhat younger fitter lot places US) Everyone's island now.

It take long close border. Possible? inevitable nukes start flying. Today India China fighting clubs, tomorrow nukes. That's true! come realize events, parents raised correctly fucking love it. often overlooked important environments parents create us shape way thinking. Great point. honestly might approaching herd immunity hit hard early on. can't find results later April, already ay 20+ percent showing antibodies back then. Even herd immunity threshold 60 percent higher, means going spread much slower, even continue reopening. Duh I'll believe someone national government sockpuppet reporting I'm embarrassed state. Next you’re gonna tell need second mask chin strap... 3 countries early smart restrictions though Thank you. appreciate Oh yeah, definitely agree. also think always case though. Cardiac care doctors really much around time cardiovascular disease accounts 1,700 deaths daily US. think ppl getting treated COVID19 cardiac care patient COVID19, COVID19 patient heart attack. See back started. Again, *idea* being, sneeze, cover mouth prevent germs spread. Now, covid doesn’t need wait sneeze. breathing puts viruses everyones air. So, wear mask contain viruses, cover mouths sneeze contain germs. Simple stuff. people drink water less thirsty virus mutate towards higher infectibility less deaths. Thats evolution. confirm. Probably helps around 20% population immune, serological test. far cry herd immunity 90%+, slow spread virus.

The 20% measured june first, early may data infections. around 25%.

And think fits observation. doubling time grow spread slower. place takes month+ lower immunity ratio see effects massive spreader event places like California, NY could take longer could seen uptick spike. 

As i've always said sub, time tell one way other. Yeah public spaces near hand sanitizer stations everywhere 2m markers also shit I'm surprised people would believe otherwise.

The virus spreading sort domino effect earlier prevention, slower spread especially since things went quarantine. next *Real Politicians Capital Hill* article literally quoting scientists medical experts Yale.

Boris Johnson got it, already white house staffers, campaign staff secret service gotten it. Combined age, attending rallies masks others masks, seems almost guaranteed point. going argue numbers, Spain recently tested 70,000 people antibodies, 5% them. Also, bear mind Spains lockdown one tightest world. stopped spread quickly. Source, live here. Hm, interesting. definitely seem correlation. However, looks like number covid cases starts dropping exactly three weeks lock implemented. could fun see pattern appears countries require masks.

Though I'm scientist, randomly guessing. Mask doesn’t keep getting Rona protects others spreading corona I've seen many people realllly underestimate flu bad season Influenza B. Honestly, years ago got flu almost hospitalized healthy person late 20's, one people. Realized every 'flu' I'd gotten bad cold super mild case. That's… shocking. info Turkmen life affected? People blaming reopening spikes cases that's what's causing there's data back up. People blaming protests increase cases, without evidence, political reasons. uncle scientist, I'm confident Trump knows thing two everything Opt saving lives? would that? forget massive protests middle pandemic Well, except compelled stop exercising right assemble protest, shit needs get ""law order"" treatment immediately, apparently. protest offered everyone get tested held special event testing 3000 got tested protests here. might extra spike result. doubt even 5% mask wearers  least intelligence valued trait back then.

First all, really hope masks effective study suggesting. conclusions study makes regarding masks dubious me. use computer projections assume effect masks based dates widespread mask usage adopted Italy NYC. could blatant instance correlation equaling causation.

Both places hardest hit fastest dates correspond peaks—the height lockdowns. know *masks* cut infection rate, factors? rates reflect dates almost everybody staying home. real test widespread masks comes everything opens back people resume normal lives + masks. look things places like California, seem like masks alone going save us. First, there’s direct evidence Now, there’s also evidence rule possibility. Second, don’t need evidence conclude this, need common sense. 
It’s like back February direct evidence support effectiveness face mask, wore anyway, Asian it’s common sense wearing won’t hurt anything. 
If decisions wait solid evidence, behind already. know reacting lead us to. And, it’s family, they’re likely hugging kissing cheeks.

We've everything we're supposed part, frustratingly feels like enough. Masks crucial study bullshit suspected countries closer proximity China see exponential growth early they're quite familiar China operates epidemic, closed borders took appropriate measures early on. rest world less aware. 

Maybe another era. Nowadays world globalized information limited geographies. K so? working fine without mask. social distancing measures. R0 rate already month 1. said, noone wears masks buy adheres rules. need study know this, but... enormous amount idiots Outside professional supportive environment fail people, even motivated educated. doesn’t matter though, need mask kind mouth covering.

A mouth covering sufficient well suppress R0. would put Chihuahua blender? :'( Yeah see kind issues like preventing it. uncomfortable wear one, makes suuper hot sweat lot normal. luckily havent overheated People crowds, often wearing masks...it's difficult assumption make. current spikes blamed reopenings, people closer contact protests mall know exactly make note phone calendar think something risky occurred. u/ThermoeletricScopes , oh masks anything? Oh countries requiring masks bad? Stop endangering family community wear mask, hell wear one want to, like matters peg. stop 3mdangering everyone else telling masks nothing. they’re completely denying it’s present there. government censorship allowing people talk  Everyone know WFH loves it. seem much relaxed now. well 100 posted past months. one emerged winner, don’t mind seeing post like daily. Shows companies trying hard personally, money treatment, vaccine. viable, proven, cheap treatment snap life back somewhat normal fast. vaccine may take long time many unknowns potential dangers associated it.

One days... another treatment link posted one waiting for. feel like assuming article wrong based conjecture dishonest you.

Unless scientist sort. dont think Swedes beat people masks. I'm Europe. wont listen. freaking economy desperate open borders get people flowing money merit Churches publicly gathering. said, virtual services.

Overall US numbers plateaued building higher first wave. Chicago, New York Michigan flattened curve second wave occur opening protest. Southern/Western states never closed Covid-19 spreading like wildfire contributing never ending wave ): unfortunately. heard guys going slow testing less cases. Seems legit me.....not. scientists expect late 2020 given promising results previous trials thus far. entire reason US told people wear masks, two months government incompetent nothing, sufficient stockpiles. incompetence, lie American people masks work, would enough supply actual medical professionals. can't go back admit failure, instead keeping lie allowing people die. Fuck able take joke lol ""*At least four cases virus tied Cruisin’ Chubbys Gentlemen’s Club Wisconsin Dells.* "" 🥰😋😂

I've waiting quote like since lockdown started.  long ago, 2 stylists symptoms tested positive coronavirus cut 140 customers' hair. None got sick. wearing masks. Well color surprised full transplants became fake hippies? LOL Japan resident here. government response slow woefully inadequate. Considering population density distancing guidelines 3 feet Japan, Tokyo much worse shape NYC right -- I'm convinced mask wearing single biggest reason isn't. Basically usa fucked legit vaccine comes Yeah, come guys. ignore virus think it’s big deal dipshits, man people sub come pretty close opposite direction. “Fingers crossed” us make this? barely even qualifies deadly like half population. absolute worst case scenario, majority us over. people regimes early stages

You're specifically talking Americans. Pretty much every ""white"" country (as put it) masks adopted early without nonsense. Europe usa December. China unknown I’m currently cook local bar. State opened week ago outdoor dining began. patio opens too. plenty space added additional seating outside. People parked way street waiting get in. social distancing ever. Customers don’t wear masks all. Even way in. ac broke wearing mask hell. mention kitchen busy tight there’s social distancing us either. can’t refuse work. It’s atm. Can’t take leave absence. Several managers believe virus threat passed. people think you’re gonna get it, you’re gonna get it. there’s nothing it. I’m starting think that’s true. Especially indoor dining set resume.

The general population care Covid rn. time tell weather it’s okay rn not. Meanwhile, leader country cases said, even week ago, believed people wearing masks show disapproval him. Gee, wonder cases... would grocery store except 75% people area wear masks. can't yell them... Worldometer posting record new cases worldwide deaths keep falling. Either care getting better, virus getting weaker, both. 2 charts add cases mean deaths. guy’s cranky kitty. think it’s mostly already dealt two months moderate lockdown. dunno early relaxed things quickly it’s clear may pay price soon. 

Our leaders put us fell asleep wheel. don’t act like care public good, people going act like well. Time distribute koolaid flavoured bleach sort covid. I’ll honest I’m living life normal possible. social distancing thing help “flatten curve” 3 months. point people going start weighing risks benefits want live lives given going away anytime near future. still get wearing masks enclosed places like grocery stores think protecting healthcare nursing facilities needs prioritized. people know also going bars, restaurants, beaches, socializing. Think? take flu test? median 5 day incubation period exposure symptoms. Retest later. guidebook life we're making go along. No, one swimming, walking, climbing, hot air ballooning, rioting Oz NZ. ocean permanent barrier line map. Tech accounts maybe 1/10 jobs Bay ton I’m sure it’s drastically different terms WFH ability LA. 

I think many faults Bay Area well educated area follow many guidelines own. “We’ll spike Adderall anti virals!”

There piece recently sneak vegetables food... zero empirical evidence says science regarding use settled. Covid going burn places reached heard immunity. Germany problems containing virus since outbreak...

And accoding website, increase 137 Active Cases 544 New Cases. also less 10 Deaths 3 Days. words: situation completely control. /s Lol knew. Well... [the audience wait five minutes reminded turn phones...] California's fairly steady upwards trajectory since March.

 anything, think huge indicator country's citizens cooperative respective governments. still think way everyone responded Covid ridiculous. figured would forced wear masks wash hands. shut whole world. again, I'm one skeptics thinks people top good good system humans control other. check too. Given antibodies don’t last long, start hearing cases reinfection given enough time course mutations, similar Korean law dictates government can't force business close unless actual incident happens. Thus, advise close them. 
And apparently unlike good people, bar/club owners decided ignore advice.

The reason law exists 1950\~1970s Korea still dictatorship military, forced small large business owners close shops indefinitely got line. (Like speak government).

Once Dictatorship went down, one first things fixed government can't abuse power again.

But guess nothings perfect. see like I'm US What, rather million deaths? Jeez, million people see they're families that's meaningless you? Cockroaches inherit earth, predicted long time prophecy holding true. dont know took personally. removed Reddit's moderator's little knowledge understanding site works. know related post/thread, I'm sorry confused, clearly understand took offense. Also, referring comment deleted, one quoted. wonder ways supposed countrys ""More top it"", like maybe perhaps mask requirements? nah. That's two package, one nose one mouth. ; ) Batshit crazy youtube conspiracy nutjub I'm inclined agree them, see masks significant effect Sweden given society structured here. 

Having people take public transport rush hours wildly effective people continuing masks on.

8 10 million people Sweden lives outside 3 biggest cities. 

The population density Seoul almost *seven* times higher Stockholm. Taipei twice Stockholm (and 8 times Göteborg)

So think study performed smaller European capitals might reach conclusion, probably FHM came conclusion looking data. Maybe making joke, he's comedian all...  people, topic maintenance explicitly taught. doesn’t come naturally them. However, time, therapy, people become aware topics conversation, say meaningful things make sense. backtracked “no wearing masks” stance realised mistake, acted bad information, i.e. believing asymptomatic airborne transmission, things known since mid-January, including baffling stances WHO, motivated politics/bureaucracy worldwide shortage masks, including ignoring early warnings Taiwan, resulted Chinese scientists taking refuge number journals instead. Studies mask wearing around years, even first epidemic kind (most relevantly SARS 2003).

The best evidence official advice needing masks complete nonsense look reactions China-adjacent countries like Macau, Taiwan, HK, SK, ignored stance took drastic measures immediately closing borders wearing masks. also help person replying to's point Fauci said intentionally lied masks worried supply. would one thing saying ""We initially thought necessary, wrong"", he's not. Strictly speaking waiting pandemic hits buy make masks already failed response. smell Pence that.

Source: former Hoosier Hawai'i we've rule since March. Anyone arriving Hawai'i 14 day quarantine, break get arrested. We've lots people arrested. Even sent cult packing. still can't answer countries. live alternate reality? Meanwhile Governor Dipshit, worst name, Greg Abbott told Texas counties tried take seriously allowed issue mask warnings.

He prison murder. true actually. journalist police complaint lodged report made Covid situation particular area. 
However I'm talking media. I'm talking average citizens. 
The number Indians social media 500 million so. half unhappy handling pandemic. pandemic really getting control, take long circulating everywhere social media. doctor that's worked ICU 5 years tell that's getting put ventilator works. put people ventilators case. strict criteria get put on/taken ventilators safe say get one unless options failed. Also, syncing ventilator happen even actually need ventilator occurs easily solvable problem using sedation/anesthesia, no, one ever dies ""not syncing"". say people got ventilators needed time people dying around europe due shortages ventilators ICU beds batshit insane guarantee can't name single state that's seen spike cases due protests. Everything said political. effective different ways. see someone mask think tend stay away subconsciously. Easy drive innovation half worlds GDP/production also attracts smart, ambitious people. Americans never even leave country, much less “drive explore.” Lay-off koolaid read history book clean busses UV light. problem nott hat healthy. virus survives 6 minutes sunlight; compared several hours/days indoor surfaces. going get COVID, Myrtle Beach would last place I'd choose go get it. also think gov Australia fucked facing last disaster (fires) maybe bit focused listened reason.  like theory thinking long time, never clearly you. 

This virus ACE2 expression, gateway virus uses enter cells bodies, might something this. Older adults chronic conditions ACE2 expression younger adults meaning virus easier time overwhelming older adults quicker. However, maybe asymptomatic people really presymtomatic takes virus longer find points entry enough cells body infect. ACE2 commonly found lungs organs older adults, significantly less younger people. However, one place young people high amount bone marrow makes blood. might seeing blood affected. 

I’ve always said beginning pandemic old going die first, might take longer kill 40 year olds. Also, think living nursing homes overly represented data early on, everyone staying locked homes, nursing homes practicing social distancing living communally.  No, pretty much right. Also, least state supreme court cut knees. bad Governor Evers Wisconsin lucky.  Holy crap, this. Everyone know thought bc manifesting symptoms. stayed thinking one could think days. Stress help either. home air filters UV sterilizers doubt would work mass indoor gathering. States can't deficit spend. feds can. Despite fact seem virus thrives colder weather, South people likely inside summertime wintertime due unbearable heat. create worse transmission rate summertime wintertime pleasant outside.

That said, nobody really knows going happen sad it’s way months. IFC \*with prevalence high\* still pretty horrific probably worth blowing economy over. can't say ""Oooh, thought total 6x5 actually 3x10. Look much lower 3 6!"" Wow post history. look see joking, extra special kind stupid. 

Fucking hell. wow.   think BLM contribute spike, paying attention neither get anxiety think Many wealthy countries gave income support along strict stay-at-home orders, testing tracing, open pretty safely many people lost jobs. 

We worst worlds - shut things without getting infrastructure open safely. opening unsafely many places, economy continue horrible large portion population want go catch virus. death usually trail infections weeks.

Also form last report looked at, Mami Dade roughly 16k cases 

I would social distance ever before.  Basically assuming 1. Texas relockdown 2. area hits 25% infected infections rate seems drop dramatically. probably happen July Houston’s rate. Also gotta consider 3. People might start wearing masks keep getting slapped face bad news. don’t agree notion everything necessarily fine cases found always directly proportional testing. would make sense randomly distributing among pool people equally likely infected virus. testing increasingly done worried healthy (as LA county), fact still getting 8% positive alarming. Hospitalizations lagging indicator wouldn’t likely many yet if, Florida, it’s largely young people infected now. Agreed. Hahaha that's great news since live Vancouver roommates discussion. got sick Late December early January.  lot people jobs also getting sick like normal ""bug"" would usually go around every year. 

&amp;#x200B;

at job, several people actually hospital couple weeks. said really bad flu. we've wondering maybe covid? Update: oh shit thats new cases less good wait Queens opens again. love much like “ok, boys want fuck around? Two weeks quarantine. maybe grow up?”

I may paraphrasing bit. yea mean, captured 1/80 cases 170 million infected US already herd immunity right around corner. Sounds absurd. seriously doubt it. Trump old, fat fuck. chances he'd actually make alive without obvious severe symptoms monumentally low. Nationwide doesn’t actually matter. catastrophic outbreak NYC NJ came control! Take numbers statistics look happening... burying start new outbreak tail earlier one different location- good understanding situation? article itself

""A fourth Black Lives Matter protester tested positive coronavirus Victoria amid the state's ""concerning"" virus spike, believed contracted COVID-19 demonstration.

The demonstrator, attended rally Melbourne's CBD June 6, linked virus outbreak retail store H&amp;M Northland.

Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said two cases linked retail outlet detected overnight, taking virus cluster's total four.""

If wearing mask, likelihood spreading virus protest high. probably right tech/work home jobs. work home helps. 

I feel like people good job social distancing, though. Downtown packed past weekends people well masks mandated Raleigh. That's feel we're due big spike. Houston third largest city United states...im actually surprised low lol Good job, Trump. matter time catches thing, isn’t it? ..no testing doesn’t mean virus goes away...sadly, ..overflowing hospitals evidence that. ironic picture mostly black people wearing mask they're affected covid yet they're protesting say ""black lives matter"" Wait people still buying this? Lol damn y’all simple minded. Looks like depends CDC's capacity specific test. probably fairly complicated since they're dealing preserved tissue could many months old.

The article say tests performed recently died, need sent CDC. holy shit can’t real right now. You’re looking new daily cases new daily deaths telling think isn’t visible decrease deaths compared cases?!? wanted debate happening (increased testing? Lower average age infected person? Mutating virus??), think lot theories could reasonably explain lower death rate, inability simply acknowledge happening, despite evidence contrary, WILD. symptoms, better characterize \[my\] underlying risk infection, assess home social factors could impact compliance self-quarantine""

The first two make sense. Anybody contact somebody Wuhan Corona Virus potential vector. couple symptoms probability vector increases. bunch symptoms, makes sense treat presumptive vector. rough idea possible, probable presumptive vectors going really important tracking spread disease many/most people going tested. Certainly tested right away, tracking cases early possible obviously goal. last, see would useful, obvious privacy concerns. I'd give answers think would get tagged low risk. think anyway Biden stands chance? put people unlikable make sure thing Trump win. rigged game get people build shit work. Federal debt real numbers game get people stuff. Can't give much money people work less can't give little work all. Lots people never go hospital symptoms 2-4 months (and still suffering). get idea that, check subreddit r/covid19positive That's terrible I'm glad hear kid alright. one disputing quality US care; world-class hospitals sure. system accessing services broken.

Your copay $750 actually really good, time seems like 20%! Percentage positive cases vs tests given still trending though. Cautious optimism bill everything entire stay. also pay physician insurance cover it. admitted hospital bad panic attack, stayed night. time cheapest health insurance could afford affordable care act enrollment. paid almost nothing. got itemized bill charged cleaning services, meals, whatever could. eventually fought hospital overall changing $15,000 sleep over. How? tried everything pretending it’s happening pretending never happened. link me? will. joke think otherwise. two options lockdown cases fall, open accept deaths, cases going even states mandating masks. NYC still even allow person retail outdoor dining, that's case rates falling Moors! didn’t dismiss concerns dismissed timeline. It’s obvious accused do. 

It would’ve easier say agree disagree, waiting never want that. You’d rather say don’t care. Tells me. 4. Profit! thought 30 feel like part problem AZ, though can’t prove it. noticed lot state license plates, period snowbirds usually leave. estimate best. way prevented gathering. Nobody stopped way. 

Just many people wanted go. Fucking idiot making everything worse  Mfw white house trust government lul isn’t common sense. Really “common sense” think everyone knows. wasn’t part culture haven’t gone modern time became “a thing countries”. learned lessons outbreaks. people didn’t know. people put make fun doesn’t change fact (and that’s lot really think) didn’t know serious enough masks. anything, hope take seriously, learn fuuuucked government mistakes making “common sense” leading example, ultimately shove rug get through. thing bothers don’t say many test performed. Without test numbers vs positive numbers 2 compared dates don’t actually know much increased. tested 50% increased 30% would actually decrease. I’m saying decreasing I’m saying need give us data. end result reactionary. Eventually end opposed everything advocating nothing. That's positivity total tests ever given. shot 31% today. AZ screwed. Illinois grandma lives Taipei. says masks mandatory public get fined without. says everyone well behaved, everything normal. Schools open, people go work. Murica joke. know, respiratory season hospitals full anyways Don’t worry guys. church covered. say Australian I'm shocked stone pieces easing restrictions much are. think aggressive we've 7,500 handful active cases.

The places easing restrictions places poping back in. Thankfully keeping boarders closed bit longer (I hope). Apparently people suggesting need open boarders tourism!

We've plenty protests NYC - increase =) I'm Kansas City. hardest hit area Wyandotte County, mostly Hispanic. see headlines black communities getting disproportionately affected much Hispanic community. getting brushed rug seems. heartbreaking. assume many scared go treatment well. Currently, 82% Hispanics testing positive, black 74%, white 59%. Populations US 18% Hispanic, 13% black, 76% news Reddit super fixated Florida, current death rates projections SoCal scary fuck. spending months telling public masks work, change stance, act surprised public wearing mask saying ""I'm sick. need wear mask"" solution......? Didn’t mean disrespect aimed me. didn’t say anything conservatives, humans ""America, none success half oppression"" mean man quite obviously repeatedly pressured odds president? Like trump even said loud, camera, front millions, “and course dr Fauci may agree me....”

Trump pressured repeatedly solely optical reasons. evidenced trumps continued resistance viral specialists continue agree best course action.  filter better filter. Mock? Come on, Buccees Waller weeks ago, yeah, 20% wearing masks inside, nobodys fucking mocking others wearing one. even did, wouldn’t give flying fuck, maybe would give flying fuck (the bird). AI takes over. Lol one taking account fact TONS TESTS?? course going cases. isn’t scary. Calm down. Indeed. thing can't quite understand newest homes often lack quality homes built century ago. house buying built 1920, original flooring, piping, crawl/basement. beams huge too. really understand people would buy new construction falls like 5 years. Sorry, it’s less physical properties paint trail fingerprints would see. Maybe fingerprinting ink better example. Funny think time erase stupid people  Wait, thought supposed injecting it? We've seeing uptick cases almost 6 weeks point.. yet deaths steady decline. starting appear less deaths lagging weaker virus. people regimes

White people countries Anglo world, shocking know.

I'd also like introduce continenent africa 92% worldwide black population live know fuck (are) either. I'll vote someone's pet poodle point. obvious? infection rates low people stayed more, worked home, available food takeout systems, people talk less subway due cultured, plain social distancing? Saying masks really scientific. Seems like common sense.  He's incompetent, American all. almost something actually something Give generations same. Retirement homes recent phenomenon, even west. Skip wand nude yoga outdoors noon. sun shine sorts new places, bound get UV inside eventually. Yes, generally kind nervous India. x2 get you’re I’m glad folks mindset do, they’re fine taking risk, they’re making sure compromise others.

Unfortunately, I’ve encountered many people don’t give fuck careless public. It’s really annoying wish would least compromise think like do. Almost seems like WAY simple analysis complex problem. Want know things governments common required masks? Leaders taking virus seriously. 

Canada never required masks handled pretty well. Compare leadership US Brazil areas issues. Social distancing responsibility pushed ton.

Venezuela leader encouraging masks day 1 Brazil leader telling everyone fake day 1. wonder difference results caused by. I'm third world country go US vacation, want live shithole. report study? ""I black friend"" complain protests bars, churches, etc., makes obvious really upset related COVID-19. Let's real, anger something else. understand saying. I'm choosing wait longer getting back normal, I've home food 3 months now; fully understand 3 months long people. point would disagree is: ""this going away anytime near future"". virus behave simply can't predicted high degree probability. 

When comes nurses like, however, serious risk bordering gross negligence. quite clearly capacity hand death sentence.

Here England, pubs open, option anyway, catch within four walls pub love money point time. Three months, however, boat loads people climbing walls we're built stay confined indoors seeing people one condemn anyone trying live life.

I would say, however, people social distancing they're living lives reckless, lazy, selfish dangerous. lots things remain unknown virus know certain social distancing contains spread prevents getting people lose lives result.

I think choice fear, paranoia isolation one hand ignoring fact contagious virus rounds capacity kill large numbers people other. There's balance people need get homes live life time respecting social distancing guidelines know certain save countless lives.  strategy USA chosen.

Reason #167 I'm moving another country over.  faith humanity restored seeing comment. I’m Asian honestly stressful going early days COVID know would attacked streets nyc. really think easy follow general public? think clear large gathering lead cases, attributing one thing would incorrect. evidence significant spread bars, restaurants, churches, beaches. least protests people wearing masks we're seeing places, though question anyone choosing wear mask public gathering unacceptable behaviour point. El Paso here. Yuuuupp. Tokyo difficult keep social distancing, especially public transport. good plan, even knowing possible early months

 ""we assume based hopefulness"" Hundreds thousands people die rich stay richer. lucky enough hunkered mansions avoiding virus relying people service industry take risk them. told u correlation doesnt equal causation world full shitty studies. looking graph lol. Right now, COVID19 emergencies ICU usage 1,213 beds. normal occupancy 1,462 beds use. Maximum surge considered 2,649. roof? Hardly.

Sorry pedantic 30 years field I’ve never come across anyone uses end year 1963 baby boomers. They're interested that. ......what hell philly seems little issue within shielding community, everyone know shielding stayed home, left house happy continue king necessary. 

Then get idiots daily briefing asking ‘Well ME, shielding people, can’t go meet friends aren’t helping ME’ can’t turn around say ‘We helping you, shielding you, know, save life maybe?’

So instead relax rules shielding.. Ignorance bliss kind information ask contact tracing?

Have prolonged close contact person spouse last week?

jk jk. took contagion. NC, many taking seriously here. Lol honestly probably today's world terrifying shame. SF, take family walk every day. Literally everyone wearing mask effectively maintaining distance. younger, less family-oriented parts town diligent, still pretty careful. took kid BLM rally couple weeks ago, 100% people wearing masks best maintain least feet distance. hard. - “diminished awareness time threats pandemic may result new larger second epidemic wave. ”

- “The best-case scenario also gradually incorporate workers daily proportion 50% higher confinement period.” anything conspiracy higher reports simply hospitals taking advantage $$ bonuses get COVID patient treat? Apparently insurance via government subsidies?

My FIL hit one yesterday. want tell imbecile governor Arizona. Doug Ducey working ASU UofA scientists develop model reopen state. Trump came town went window. Ducey scrapped plans went Trumps new federal plan. reveal was. kept secret. that?

Here That's Mill Ave downtown Tempe. bars restaurants full Scottsdale. imagine cities.

Then came protests. broke bunch stuff rich side town (Scottsdale) Ducey shut state curfew. 8pm 5am. move like effects entire state good idea coordinate city mayors? Nope. guy went twitter announced it. mayors largest cities found tweet.

Lastly dodged leader telling city's want comes masks.

Doug Ducey turd leader. Vermont good example handling right. Compare neighboring states... Using logic shouldn’t lot things chance someone might die it. stop driving immediately. 

I live county 2.2 million people 221 covid deaths. Half nursing facilities. 

Things open month now. There’s protests three weeks. still surge hospitalizations deaths. Well, gee, thanks diss... This. cases early May, level deaths though mean, case, it’s one word meaning headline hasn’t changed. I’d say I’m neutral issue. Honestly probably rental cars.

Source: every single foreign plated car i've seen run plates rental point, one forced wonder whether Trump, notorious germaphobe, already COVID 19. point: comment replying deleted.

I'm waiting post removed, too. censorship adversely affecting ability honest conversations Coronavirus, topic forum. exactly purely political? literally spread virus ...  took strongest precautions country California...and I'm disgusted people becoming lax, desensitized fact pandemic going away.

Fortunately death rate low case load also low. can't believe people giving easily. guarantee useless middle management type afraid pegged useless are. Ok, here's another one. already outspend lose twice military budget. Try adding trillion debt per month. read post attempt math all? Even despite spending jack virus. merely cutting military jackshit cutting deficits whatsoever, considering entitlement mandatory spending outpace tax revenues (pre pandemic) stands true even adding penny military spending pile.

Please read articles. Yep, thing school district. plans basically read like list plans needed.  options discussed incredibly absent implementation details. kind information ask contact tracing? second I’m asked personal question number I’m familiar with, I’m hanging up. many scammers risk anything. politicians MoH sang flu song mid march. Italy couldnt swept rug got going.

Cases dropping lockdown, lot ppl thought govt fucking self-isolated govt told us. Trump, DeSantis, Abbott stupid competition. Suprised pikachu face Vietnam 0 deaths right next china I’m sure, people eat drink lot stadiums it’s little different You’re right. individual may mild symptoms doesn’t mean virus didn’t damage organs thus causing problems future. Obviously bunch people dying ideal, weighed economic damage another shutdown, would also lead kinds serious ills. comment pessimistic ""America fat, sick, stupid health care"" comment challenge estimate. said, look present infection mortality rates, 2.2. million number falls pretty well within range estimated deaths 80% infections. lower end we'd see ~1.7 mill, upper end ~2.6 mill. I'm optimistic guys stop total morons point get ""fuck it"" mode long numbers Yep Voices common sense marginalized attacked. Alternate theories

1 - virus getting weaker general.

2 - people risk taking precautions now, contracting less therefore dying less.

3 - weak already dead

There bit sarcasm responses :) dog horrible, not—I think—because dog.

The dog street vendor. little fatty cubes, thick stripes fat thin stripes meat, sort like 3/4 inch cube bacon. tough chewy. little hairs coming one side, wrinkles, though fatty cut back old dog's neck. finally, under-cooked.

Geezus doesn’t care supporters remember 5 days tell can’t soon you’re infected. think logically. random sample body fluids/mucus contain identifiable amounts viral matter virus must time take hold body begin replicating many times over. You’re technically infected soon virus enters body. sampled mucus fluids right you’d almost chance getting random sample.  
Edit: “In report findings published May 13 journal Annals Internal Medicine, researchers found probability false negative result decreases 100% Day 1 infected 67% Day 4. false negative rate decreased 20% Day 8 (three days person begins experiencing symptoms). also found day person started experiencing actual symptoms illness, average false negative rate 38%. addition, false negative rate began increase 21% Day 9 66% Day 21.” become political issue. really way deny that. I'd argue made political intentionally certain parties, case politics direct measurable effect.

I mean, political science still fact based, scientifically minded endeavor. Peoples feelings influence veracity facts. let politics influence decisions facts allow discussions, lost legitimate claim unbiased, well informed discussion. People making masks symbol interest.

To me, masks people. wear one want spread germs (or covid, case may be) elsewhere.

I would wager people wear masks people OK living privileged societies (read: tolerant marginalizing others). haven’t able buy personal disinfectants since March April 

What need? Stuff home? Except likelyhood whether catch entirely based well contain efforts like mandatory mask usage. completely depends circumstances too. live small town mostly drive places generally close contact lot people, yeah chances pretty low. live city rely public transportation generally need walk places lot statement completely wrong. Telling people need worry numbers small exactly got mess. view CDC stats, huge surge pneumonia deaths states. Yeah it’s nuts.

Yes, many states behind epidemiological curve. places virus could described anything close ""out control"" very, few.

Love, 
A jealous American ability shut borders experience significantly lower seeding events.

Of course, say never chance eliminate virus United States. said June 2020, eliminated three months lockdown, additional lockdown probably going sufficient. yet deaths continued fall pretty dramatically - even national cases plateaued slowly began increase. We’re talking 75 percent decrease deaths compared ~20 percent decrease new cases. 2 month period. lag alone explain it. 

There multitude factors including testing milder cases, lower average age infection, well better treatment. That’s say won’t uptick I’d surprised see March/April highs. running book? I'll take 8 days until, pls. *Astronomia intensifies* necessarily. stuck inside March April virus counts dropping, increasing.

If cover up, right now, stem tide. median age infection 60s beginning. 60+ year olds case fatality rate Florida 37. case fatality age group &lt;0.5%. puff puff pass go see hug him! list strings supposed bad computers. goes something like ""You've coma 20 years, we're trying new thing, know end dreams. Wake up, family wants see you"" Why? Just...why? want virus spread, ruin country? somehow people still think China deaths US saying, giant group people, wearing masks, not, outside- lead spread Considering protests “right” wear masks 

I'm sorry what? news me. protests opening economy back up, according to, know, 100% reporting saw it. 


The protests exactly BLM protests, smaller numbers. wearing masks, not, outside. either agree spread virus, accept biased hypocrite. ""The needs many outweigh needs few, one"" Yep, we've totally given up. fewer shipments food though? Would wrong blame little?

I mean, saw writing wall back city one case, one resolved two weeks case. Started wearing gloves, stopped allowing kids come grocery shopping, changed weekly shop earlier hours avoid crowds etc

My mother, 60, actually thing.

Even company wiped cart (which back then) wiped too. want sell stuff. want protect much. Can't trust company honestly protect you. bottom line. got one UV wands. best insert anus, throat? 10 days recovery likely antibodies longer contagious (hence wearing mask, advisable abundance caution, probably necessary) crazy. dumbfounded number people area actually believe it. And?

First all, clearly shows big spike hospitalizations

Second all, that’s date hospitalizations doesn’t represent current number active hospitalizations

Third all, ICU capacity sitting around 60% April. it’s well 80%. Totally absolutely nothing surge recorded cases AZ right? City (tx), record shutdown 12 cases diagnosed single day. Fast forward reopened. Last week, record 14 single day. 2 days 21. today 48 cases single day. Yet everyone still carrying normal behaving even smallest precautions, wearing face cover, biggest inconvenience life. feel states want correctly fear well past point contact tracing feasible. Even states trying hard, like NY, blown states arent.

Parishioners dying would make “martyr” would Messianic... don’t go there. words, stupid pseudoscience kills people. Swedes still doofuses. killed lot grandma grandpas needlessly.

Try nitpick that.

Much world laughing government. Sex toys rural America... real victims here.... old broom! good old stick shift! Look! carrot! Uuhh! eggplant! tooth brush! plunger ( always available).... Hubby, really get lathe! new LG washing machine anymore.

Stop Rural American! Covid19 coming us! remember announcement clearly. wonder people confused. CDC really botched long game one. June 15-30 admitted 
June 16-21 admitted

For specifically COVID19, confirmed cases. There's much here. tried. California biggest protests, biggest, country. way factor numbers .

""As Sunday, state reported 46,735 cases since mid-March. Newsom noted past two weeks alone, state seen 35.6% cases thus far."" live Raleigh. Never heard place, probably good reason  can’t avoided. Thank you. States *can* deficit spend. However, ability limited compared federal government. Many states ""balanced budget requirement"" prohibits deficit spending--these states could amend law permit deficits, would take time places would politically impossible. states engage deficit spending (California, example). general, state laws tightly restrict issuance government debt (i.e., deficit financing). U.S. Treasury much, much discretion sell debt, Treasury bills, notes, bonds. theory, Treasury could also print money pay debts (although would terrible idea). contrast, states cannot issue form currency. bets off, I'm sure better nothing... health safety theater cost impact, questionable value. study Westchester, less 1/3 6000 covid patients ever temperature. also 100 things cause fever. Travelers pop Tylenol hour safe. ""acceptable "" rate??? Well technically speaking, cars eventually lead death animal plant life planet due emissions sooooooo might right track there.  Show state larger decline cases right now. worry...I'll wait. BTW, I'm NY resident too. Vaccines take average 18 months develop. clinical trials. Due pandemic urgency, may shortened 15 months, simply guarantees.

I expect vaccine mid-late Spring know effectiveness near future. BLM protest worth dead family members I’m seeing many articles good news treatments/vaccines administered put use? Quite opposite - natural selection key evolution. maybe take one week get extra 50,000... yay exponentials people forgetting fucking math.

What tale guy asked king double grain rice tile chess board? shit Ok Karen Actually complete total lockdown, straight quarantine infected persons contact tracing, much better public education would’ve nipped thing bud we’d already done it.

What instead loose, half assed advisory try get people stay home sometimes try get close plenty people anyway, clear direction...and poor public education. official bulletins state Arizona still don’t recognize asymptomatic transmission, pretty much imply you’re safe long aren’t around someone fever. Likely thing Florida Texas given similarity governors’ directions. got unpleasantness economic damage lockdown none benefits, we’re still going get deaths tremendous economic disaster comes many people get seriously ill. lacks discipline. Honestly would smart. I'm little bit preggers Almost every server CA mask. Based reply original comment assumed wouldn’t change mind. mind giving reply harsh giving illegal immigrants. understand, thank that.

I apologize personal comments re: post history, I’ll delete those. understand addiction difficult. Let good times roll. 0.26% death rate come. Good. knew Sweden run doofuses. Yeah friend Denmark says Europe happy America’s lack effort, especially since president willing hold rally Tulsa. seen blatant disregard everyone’s efforts thus far. Kind like slap face. explain states like Utah Arkansas never locked down, suddenly major spikes mid June? states like Texas, Florida dozen others relaxed lock late April-early May suddenly major upward trend too?

If spikes reopening, alarming delayed spike would show - almost one full month 1.5 months later. That’s he’s unacceptable job Thank you. So...more testing? bare minimum social distancing, really quarantining. infinitely safer wearing mask staying home, wearing mask going  Lol realized? Spoken like real expert. original paper article referring says. cherry picks 3 41 cases examined slightly less efficient antibody response makes mention 38 antibodies equally effective strains.

And even 3, case antibodies work.

The boys girls r/COVID19 explain much better though since That’s really us state right? Literacy fairly low. Sad traitor swamp. play part play game! got ELECTROLYTES! plants crave! world held together spit, baling wire, dumb fucking luck. go. That's, what, *four months* since have? Armed protestors *in front yard*. “Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position charging hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving argument.”

Source - Wikipedia seriously? going new thing Trump holding indoor rallies worst hit areas?

Next week, he's holding rally Texas. nursing home.

(I joke, joke. mean, hope he's holding one nursing home, knows days!) love human. We're amazon way.

We complain complain complain amazon big corporation. 5 mins later we're amazon looking things buy. Im hating anybody. hate amazon is, policies ethics employment field.
Simply put want convenience. We're lazy fucks make personal lives better.

Its like eating candy. Bad you, love it, hate it, know want it.

Think impact make decided set date everyone world didnt use amazon 1 day. 1 day. Pick different corporation every year fuck em hard day.

Dont agree, dont to. :) cruel irony world ignorant often loudest. Nyc years. live northern nj. Pretty much anyone know commutes job nyc refuses commute again. either work home find job nj. ChaChing! No, wasn’t point. child exposed different things interest others. Learning think scientifically good thing. Formulating hypotheses, presenting objective results, good things. Realistically, many ever going use that? we’re lucky one two graduating class goes scientific field study. God willing one actually goes achieve masters. 1 every 200 graduates masters actually managed land job field. happens rest hundreds kids graduating class hs? They’re going retail jobs, data entry small cubicles, service industry, maybe one day might manage grocery store. scientific thinking learned 7th grade ever really valuable except pass next grade?
And it’s great you’re passionate teaching health issues positively kids, subject alone one controversial topics discussed schools. school may right, there’s hundreds won’t can’t best health lesson kids get “you might notice changes next couple years, can’t talk though, questions go home ask parents.” Many schools can’t even discuss reproductive system menstrual cycle openly. great does, many don’t. also mean way best way teach normalized body positivity everything along it? No, doesn’t. That’s also something done either distance learning online workshops peers. Kids might even feel comfortable learning subjects home feel safer. They’re free ask questions anonymously find answers given trusted resources. Learning sex middle aged authority figure room 30 peers arguably never best way. 
And certainly school environment provide important building blocks education, self confidence, personal growth, etc. Like I’d said, it’s child learns individual human being. It’s vital. it’s vital setting previously, it’s barely available setting we’re sending back to.
My message isn’t education isn’t important. Kids need exposed things prepare future. knowing topics interest topics don’t pick career path, learning socialize share space behave community. They’re getting new environment. ways accomplish would far safer current climate pushing Billy back classroom 6 wearing hazmat suit learn importance scientific thinking he’ll likely never use for. could use time help develop interests new topics new ways learning rather force dystopia them.
And never start comment remark wall text immediately follow wall text well.  lot concentrated Los Angeles. they’re supposed resume film production next weeks. right mind would agree go LA time like this?

Maybe bunch big Hollywood stars start refusing films there, state local governments start taking seriously again. That’s correct, based studies since last month protesting outside hasn’t shown significant increase cases. Funny, Russia, Brazil, US hardest hit. good hear this! Sorry man, support censorship. certainly downvoted report you. Deaths lag onset disease. This, coupled lag reporting deaths, make seem decline. hoping disease deadly (through better understanding time,) honestly soon say numbers look like future. 

As hospitalizations, answer. look Dade hospitalizations. I'm Palm Beach. fluctuate here, nothing scary yet. concerned way Governor changed reporting ICU beds today. makes wonder would change policy midstream. debauchery afoot. sure though. So, that's 2 cents. sub february teach vitamin d, put mask, blood clotting, old people, men obesity higher risk, etc.

Now sub mostly extension /r/politics headlines articles pop pure clickbait.

I post articles try break media charm, people think themself again. traction time. Cope. According NYT data, deaths remain mostly constant since mid April Keep good news Thailand, need it! virus mitigated masks? Yes.

Does care cause is? No. bartend spot IE. Well I’m supposed go back. can’t convince stand behind bar maskless idiots eating drinking talking loud music. Like come bar seating allowed? Without protection bartender? safety safety guests. mean literally making drinks others consumption right front people. come grocery store clerks got plastic dividers?  odds yourself. 5% huge number statistically speaking people appearances, aides meticulously wiping everything testing everyone comes within 50 feet them. 

In fact lot local leaders Arizona go high degree testing getting anywhere NEAR president lot found asymptomatic infections. tell locust swarms China world's largest dam danger collapse? Holy shit....that fortune cookie last weekend!!! wonder blood boy is.  keep hearing it’s increasing lot places states world tracker doesn’t really seem reflect outlets saying? places underreporting? know plenty people got infected work, office setting everyone mask. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hopefully wake call fat ones “hey... maybe take care body?” pegnate.? There’s another trump rally scheduled? 

Amazing. Yes individual cases require specific consideration. prove statement ""there's nothing do"" beyond euthanasia shitty nursing homes. This. already opening many countries. posts wild - ton options travel wise right now, airline ""Shutting down"" like many posts say.

&amp;#x200B;

I traveling - going 2021 restarts. weren’t quarantine 6 months ago, come issue either way. Cool. tell use masks...because shortage them. probably gets regular antibody treatments. think Maddow said ICU beds parts Arizona allready 85 percent full now. true. haven’t found info however, come back fall strength go ventilator, icu route again. lag hospitalizations deaths begin with? peak death, hospitalizations, new cases timeframe, nationally per state. I’ve reading, new cases spiking, hospitalization gone deaths still going down. Maybe there’s chance spike deaths large spike hospitalization might happen since younger people getting? still know fuck ""asking"" anything. want thing slow down, not? know interstate travel shut already. absolute last thing northeast states need right people coming coast states explode shut again. goodallow, cannot help notice moving one subject next without addressing really even noting points making. I'd like ask rly quick go further, bot? Russia? China? I'm meaning insulting I'm honestly curious.

Also Goodallow, girl's father dead basically saying: ""Good Riddance, saved buck one."" slightly horrifying me. Sacramento contact tracers say common infection source medium sized indoor get together like birthday party. exposure times like shopping, wider spacing like offices, outdoors general seem nearly risky fun events friends family :( Explains West Point Ramp. people prison  Dr. opthamolagist even practicing one. Also start making masks. friend started early provided lot masks. She, like many others, go work, started business home. Wasting time speaking facts logic people. you’re you’re must silenced. won’t silenced? must lose job! Losing job enough silence you? family, friends pets must punished too! That’s enough? .... still waiting next part far everyone backing kneeling mob. can’t satisfy mob. want more, more, more.... got Jim Bakker snake assuming everyone susceptible, isn’t true. people can... feel things you...? really explain concept you? Probably everyone besides saw coming weeks ago hearing Texas reopening. Houston swamped. heard reliable source testing previously seeing positive rates around 7% people getting PCR tests. currently sitting around 30% positive rate week ...and 6 year old daughter.

But *those* people, could seen coming? He's discovered he's immune, he? piece work guy is. Right!? many small towns hospitals send folks city hospitals. Good thing built urgent care centers profit closed hospitals! /s Dude scientific research paper well regarded publication. isn’t “article.” no, random internet commenter, please tell us know scientists. Texas got 5000 new cases today, along California.  COVID thing big joke them? Good Lord ... live near too. Never tried never plan to. definitely take advice places.  Sure annoying keep changing mind least can.... still early know long term effects, percentage people lingering symptoms new, permanent health problems. early throw numbers, I've seen numbers suggesting upwards 30% cases developing long-term issues, take number grain salt. Without access original text, can’t tell model decline I’d like know also. However, absence artificial mitigating factors, epidemic different seroprevalence % virus longer enough hosts reproduce faster dies off. don’t know COVID-19, it’s probably somewhere 80 90%. However, socially safe assume even got near levels, would become universally excepted virus serious people would willing go strict lockdown stop it.

 countries already realized serious went extreme lockdowns. America obviously not. becomes question social modeling epidemiological modeling. like algebra! nerve letters pretending numbers something! told wife, first fought toilet paper, masks, sanitizer, meat (?), re-open, pretty soon we’ll fighting tests, bed hospital. confirmed cases Paris people died ""pneumonia"" back November. also sam people think police keep teargassing BLM protesters... irony states follow, we’re second inning, it’s gunna get really ugly psh. Pooper Cooper think they're using now. Can't insult without poop joke. Honestly 70% people wearing masks pretty damn good. got rate everywhere we’d much better off. Here's hoping certain person unfortunate contact someone symptomatic. care I'm banned Yes, indeed. Suggestions work! much mandates, bit remember people started decreasing travel NBA shut down. Leading example go far trump refusing wear mask likely tangible effects sad indeed. light end tunnel hospitals can't even coordinate send patients. new information leads different conclusions...funny science works. Yes Yea stupid! injected disinfectant, smarter! OMG. could missed one? Android.. permanent disturb.. exception known numbers. app needed. None true. Flights still happening, countries slowly surely opening up. I’m sure protests big contributing factor. I’m reading biggest spikes states reopened everything, probably lot too. must really scary live state cannot tell difference news fake news. understanding cross reference news stations. idea source international news even computer translate Italian English you. clear hand-washing plays huge role. seems spread contaminated surfaces much rarer long exposure contaminated person, meaning mask way important washing hands.

I mean, agree general point, thought interesting original advice ""no need wear mask, wash hands"" actually opposite done. Let’s hope leads men women working equally splitting household equally. benefits men women. always obvious Trump would mega-Katrina moment ever tested. frustrating thing inevitable crisis took long arrive, turned severe.

The emperor could revealed clothes hurricane smaller scale terrorist attack affecting thousand people. happened couple years ago, might changed impeachment math. things good long. endure least another seven months this. Actually good data. Outside activities even crowded ones like protests fine mask. 

Inside activities without mask clearly bad based outbreaks. Thank you. appreciate it! company already said can't office without permission end calendar year. fine WFH got memo I'm going stir crazy. Implying rest *cough* POISON Norwegian response was:

- wear masks unless sick, help limited amount masks. (Total lie, help use even diagnosed.) 

-No one wore masks even everyone scared. Still one wearing masks.

- Still almost one getting sick.

How fit in?
Could think maybe masks less important social distancing? Norwegian's exceptionally good that?

Or countries using masks also good culture following official health guidelines? never stupid enough believe would summer lull way people acting this. masks shit part... Cloth masks. There's reason healthcare workers wear n95 particulate masks. sit professors lap college?

Ffs Band practicing indoors outdoor graduation everyone staff Google Meeting praising band great kids were. earlier read UIL regulations come apoplectic decided say anything. wife decide take son 7th grade band would athletics really want's try football try basketball. Hopefully UIL look evolving situation come guidance soon. understand people surprised. Everyone knows US healthcare absurdly unnecessarily expensive. really doubt US ever require masks national basis. ship sailed issue become political now. true touch face much dirty hands adjust mask.
On top supply huge issue (at least here, US). government would mandated masks, even close enough. city, would acceptable business owner put sign says *""FACE MASKS REQUIRED (WHITES ONLY)""*? proclamation, POC apparently exempt law ""muh systematic racism"". Selective enforcement law based race slippery slope treading #1 vector Wuhan according Hong Kong University study relatives family visiting other's houses. Almost 80% outbreaks traced back this.

Stay fuck away relative's houses, ffs. Don’t hold breath. Quebecer - nice see. Late March, April May brutal exhausting. Truthnuggets risking death millions collapse society nightclubs? ya blow stupid-town pal? ophthalmologist doctor. supporters say anything TDS. Maybe losing thread recently. There's nothing wrong least learning basics, students options road. can't tell many times I've kicked taking math seriously HS (I never went past precalc, though school offered several levels calculus). Normally Japan top stuff. best guess focused Olympics, hoping wasn’t big deal, subconsciously (or consciously) suppressed decisive action reduce spread virus. research easy. Many things seem intuitively correct turn wrong unexpected reasons, sometimes unknown reasons. 

The easiest example is: country snake problem, solution pay dead snakes. Pays dead one delivered. pay many snakes, soon discover people breeding money. Stop paying. Snakes released. Paying snakes increased snake population. 

There examples like scientific discipline expect one thing obvious eventually find something different. Sometimes lead great leaps understanding, question it. follow seat belt laws? That's something government ""forces"" us people complain like wearing masks. thing, safety issue. transcend ""personal freedom"" could save lives around them. Thought life priceless ? Welcome Hell. prosecuted sued. That’s true all. Plenty States sell bonds 10 year maturity. way Fed pays deficit, selling bonds printing money many would make believe 

I think California cannot run deficit fiscal year. short, can’t sell bonds cover difference. bit stupid honestly Major portion Indian population already started believing claim. **No one world could, ancient Indian Ayurvedic ""science"" found corona cure**. 

We clearly lack scientific approach towards self proclaimed ""discoveries"". Forget Coronill miracle drug, even water works many minor ailments placebo. Yes. isnt air conditioning somehow causes Covid, air systems public places like restaurant whatever could recirculate virus particles someone shedding isnt enough exchange outside air. few, date, true reinfection cases. previous genetic predispositions. early ones misdiagnosed cases via poor testing quality. also important note difference reinfection genetically specific strain, infection new mutated form. latter possible due RNA based virus prone mutations say, it’s hot outside NYC past several days, mask uncomfortable. wear it, though, makes sense me. imagine live place hasn’t mandated masks believer, would much difficult make case. live upstate NY know college? haven’t heard yet. got ‘mystery chest infection flu tested negative flu’ (since can’t call Covid people freak out) Jan 1st traveling ski resort Colorado. came home spread like wildfire everyone house. didn’t feel human mid February. Agreed vaccine won’t provide 100% solution. want taxes go tbh right thing mask social isolation. isn’t rocket surgery. death traps. wearing masks quarantining since became mandatory country. People aware responsible instead reacting government's actions. guy straight shot refusing comply mask laws Spanish Flu.

I suspect generally discouraged, people power tend hate idea people face concealed. I'm sure far factor, expect one primary ones. quality life problems age group beyond anecdotal stories reddit? here.

I work hospitality, building small could hold 40 max, 3 4 servers working top one another (not including chefs).

Aircon practically necessity building, simply see could work otherwise. 

UK relaxed 2m rule say pubs bars restaurants reopen...

I looking forward go back. want able see family without worrying way. safe way it. Certainly university level. Can't kill elderly killed April *philosoraptor* haven't. share link? I’m sure that’s supported data currently available. virus travels via respiratory droplets, air, don’t know HVAC systems deal redistribution droplets. Also, believe big transmission events studied involved people relatively close together.

This question matters I’m afraid tells people masks good unless wear day, they’re less likely wear all. Except tax cuts abortion restrictions Around 15% people show antibodies anymore 6 weeks.

Source? Arrest sheriffs? Yes! Real leadership would setting temporarily facilities outside major cities... like New York did... instead sitting eyes closed pretending tsunami critically ill coming. 
It’s almost want kill seniors people underlying conditions. look healthcare social security money save. this, don’t want hear shit cuts SS social programs. people killed off, plenty money budget. Stop HCQ bs. Seriously. Give up. death rates low 15-16% population 54 years older. population young haven’t gone next stage demographic transition.   also important surgery? supposed resting got right work hit, pretty dedicated tbh. things well especially tracking... Good know.  Tabloid article, definitely concern answers head new NHS centre COVID-19 recovery said worried little known long consequences could last. No, won't. live KS. know people state ordered quarantine (back March California list). one called checked them. technically order, reality, really nothing guideline since really enforced. honor system anything else. Sounds like presidential disaster going work out. Unlimited paid time  worry I'm seeing articles LinkedIn suggest might long term damage virus.  way penetrates body way people reacting ugly.  Hopefully find soon addressed immediately something bad. way get oxygen blood without lungs. lungs messed even ventilator. don’t know criteria get treatment don’t think hospitals even option. Things relaxed outside activities. We're week 3 protests, month since memorial day weekend numbers still promising. definitely continue we're working. man really shitty way living right now. way. dam librels body mostly produces small intestine keep linings small intestines toxic bacteria.

I sure exactly interpret found seems like maybe diet accounts much alpha-defensins produced intestinal lining. Buytric acid fiber L-leucine protein sources ""stimulate secretion alpha-defensins Paneth cells"" intestinal Dude, sucks. I'm sorry happened you, essential definitely expendable. Yes are, sleepy J going win, big time. see arbitrary numbers whether safe open. Utah, TX, CA, NC low case numbers initially opened. Lower NYC's current numbers. safe vaccine. either accept open, stay locked down. Probably earlier China wasn’t overreaction. appropriate reaction based facts time. places lot worse others, good job overrunning system. therefore appropriately cautiously scaled back restrictions since...

I really don’t understand people wanted happen. figuring together. Masks, testing, distancing, regularly disinfecting; seem helping, yeah let’s things makes sense; next best option. triangle higher normal number jobs lend well done home (high tech job count). Also area skews young (with many colleges universities) liberal people may trying social distance. That's pure speculation, though. infections going exponentially yet deaths decline? Also hospital beds steady.

Im Miami sometimes feel good numbers later day terrified numbers even later indifferent too. situation can’t careful. Even experts wrong, we’ve lost nothing. they’re right (which believe big fan science) don’t listen, could wind dead. Thank you! Hope expert gets corona News4 San Antonio, Jun 22, 2020.

San Antonio Mayor Nirenberg:  **""The infection rate accelerated beyond anyone expected continues rate that's unabated, we'll quickly overwhelm hospital system,"" Mayor Nirenberg said.**

The city reporting last week saw positivity rate **16.9 percent**, low 3.5 percent city seen earlier pandemic.

As Monday, reported 7,156 confirmed cases, 274 Sunday. those, 446 hospitalized 124 ICU 60 using ventilators.

SAN ANTONIO - **Bexar County surpassed 7,100 COVID-19 cases, 10 days passing 4,000 threshold.** fair, nobody could imagined bad Americans would fuck up. Nobody. 240+ millions go! good news got sick first. Needlessly.

Should get many sick possible good news? me. someone data long term health affects 

1. Long term happened yet.

2. Even did, know %age people long term effect (May 1%, May 50%, May 0.01% %ages matter)

If coming science high ground, better science right, else sow distrust science shuts everything call nazi dictator, like state. Except we're trending downward good pace, so, ya know, he's keep us live kinda nazi. Next giving constituents tough talking to. Virus solved dad, textbook Covid case, Called Cleveland clinic asking one last week. said don’t bother, blood Antibody tests basically useless.

Those antibody results limited probative value best high chance it. USA #1. US: I’m sure settled 6’ guideline. We’ve known longest time happens exhaled air spaces. Knowing human behavior (especially American right now), people going take magical number formulated safety factor (they don’t really expect drive *exactly* 55mph, right?). one even stays 6 feet away, normal outside arms reach, people add maybe foot top “social distance”. Touche Yeah imma need source bullshit  Funny lockdown last resort returning stay home orders, plans. Though none plans mentioned discussed, questions media basically never happen him. Yeah, eventually everything open. want food, well gotta keep meatpackers open. want car tire fixed, well need open repair shops. need parts, well engineering firms need stay open... 

And eventually end things open think essential. NZ masks optional general public ministry health guidelines industries needed them, mostly medical staff. really strict lockdown 2 meter social distancing rule go pretty well kept to. also shut things community transmission easier contain isolation social distancing. exception wonder? deaths, infected, spite one (except health workers) wearing masks. (Norway) Yeah, idk people cant get head China absoluyely lied shit early definitely shitload deaths early on. literally videos bodies lining streets. doesnt mean didnt turn things around eventually. Also, wouldnt surprised shit leaked level four lab. Super coincidental lab there. Well, say everything's bigger Texas. never addressed account 2 years old used last two months.

Play again, bot. Denial funsies. ""Newberry, Fla. -- Jun. 23, 2020 -- American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), leading organization bariatric surgeons integrated health professionals nation, declared metabolic bariatric surgery ""medically necessary best treatment life-threatening life-limiting disease severe obesity"" called safe rapid resumption procedures, largely postponed along surgeries deemed elective amid COVID-19 pandemic. 

In new position statement entitled, ""Safer Surgery,"" published online journal SOARD, ASMBS strongly rejects classifying metabolic bariatric surgery ""elective"" prefers use term ""Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive Surgery"" ""Medically Necessary Non-Emergent Surgery"" better characterize effectiveness intervention progressive nature many diseases treats including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension heart disease. 

""COVID-19 may factor quite time longer treatment obesity, type 2 diabetes related diseases postponed, greater chance become worse,"" said Matthew M. Hutter, MD, MPH, president ASMBS professor surgery Harvard Medical School. ""Each state, doctor patient must make decision conditions metabolic bariatric surgery right, sooner safely performed, quickly obesity, type 2 diabetes diseases reduced resolved."" 

The ASMBS recommends precise timing surgery carefully considered based factors including individual patient's health status, local prevalence COVID-19 availability resources including hospital beds, ventilators personal protective equipment (PPE). 

The ASMBS statement concludes, ""Before COVID-19 began, clear patients obesity 'safer surgery'. era COVID-19, 'safer surgery' patients obesity may prove even important before."" Obesity identified independent risk factor adverse outcomes including death among COVID-19 patients.
"" 7 days incubation, average 9 days hospitalization. month research guess... He's leader setting good example regardless whether not. Could wipe shoes get home? find outdoor churches bars feds forced states reopen businesses order get aid funding.

They've essentially forced make problem worse order get help. though. wrong wasn’t wrong people predicted. Maybe C+? got great surgeon general NYC probably hit herd immunity tbh Nice, I’m supposed move state work next month Heaven help smoke too. First phase iii! Thanks spreading disease around country trying 29 years....it's swamp we're stuck Good luck trying impose that. crap load commuters Jersey. also quite bit traffic passing through. Pakistani government incompetent comes providing basic services people. lockdown would exacerbate plight people terror groups exploit. assuming it. looks 100% like fake cures. 

It exist cure works everybody right away. 

To say ""my medicine cure everybody right away"" like ads claim ""everybody gets rich thing instantly."" Culturally, upper Nordic peoples refer Danes ""the Italians Nordics"" Danes relatively gregarious outgoing, like hug upon greeting example MUCH rare Nordics. also LOVE party/go nightclubs, bars, restaurants imo closed soon enough. Danes super fun (not danes ofc, overall) probably part bit ass.

So despite ongoing pandemic? Disgusting! basically euthanized elderly population. It’s disturbing “progressive” country would decide kill elderly could go bar. post much, certainly recognize presence. Hope well. Take care keep us updated. Much love. assume talking [Hart New York.

I actually think quarantine new hot spots good idea, clearly advocating primarily think better everyone else. sort animal-like power play, guess fits way Cuomo Wilhelm struggling other. places America seeing spikes protests

That doesn’t mean place US seeing spike protests.

The virus doesn’t spontaneously generate soon gather large group people. areas good job controlling virus protests started others starting slip. huge protest escape relatively unscathed long handful infected people showed effective job proactively testing protesters. Conversely, smaller protest shit show community it’s held already poor job virus. Yep- really think history going look *very* unkindly whole incident, way handled. *Literally,* telling people use masks (!?), *masks ineffective.*

What's wild *had* 2 N95s bought January first read covid still didnt use consistently mid March, fucking messaging. Absolutely unreal.  Last place go pandemic cinema. told contacts? That's I'm doing. need know work, might exposed definitely exposed Better try get right thing avoid traveling place dangerously high infection burden. It’s talking about, specifically referenced ‘we’ mentioning Texas.  Imagine grandfather landing Normandy, dodging bullets watching best friends take last breath years, coming home raising family. let’s look kids ptsd cuz stay home school.

""From June 27th"" June 27th, therefore borders Denmark Sweden still closed. FACT!             
Denmark Norway open borders Sweden, "" Swedish regions low infection rate."" FACT!       
         
Plus, likely change time. good way Sweden. know? every time somebody said ""Soon Sweden get better countries"" turned contrary.      
It's rather pathetic pretend NewYorkTime article ""lie"" suit narrative.     
But then, I'm getting used twisted logic Swedes fanboys trolls. ""A lockdown save lives ruin economy"" ""Swedes respect strong social distance, that's economy plunged""; ""Herd immunity never Sweden's strategy"" ""Sweden reach herd immunity countries thanks excellent strategy""... per capita? Morons. them. real someone know dies unfortunately. whatever want, NY still lot control. 

And think COVID-19 profit interstate commerce bridge sell you. OK, sold me. SARS = COVID19 fucked. can't infections testing would gotten biopsy known testing could cause get disease. revolutionize medicine.

thanks Dr. Don. think might get Noble Prize big Barry's. Well tried medicines ? assuming like someone whos faker ?  said cure aids cancer too....

The truth hospitals prepared March. enough PTE, enough staff, enough ventilators, enough kidney machines.

But weeks started get together prepared. Banner obviously wanted wait last minute. God protect health care workers. awful 6 weeks, minimum. think everything it. Bay Area one strict country (if most?) since whole thing started. People generally understood necessity shutting down, started wearing masks pretty quickly, scale. 

This obviously true everyone, people wear masks public, even conservative friends - people generally disagreeable related shut down, respected it. course expert, listen experts podcasts Germany. even experts super confident exactly spreads.

My guess would NYC March April insufficient testing rise lockdown might actually increased testing underlying/hidden much higher incidence. real cases go down, increased testing shows rising numbers.

In Germany new cases super spreading meat packing, nursing homes prisons due superspreader
I would say yes. person super spreader, situation enables super spreading. yes situations perfect super spreading conditions. far know. yet Australia, government advised wearing masks, 102 deaths total. trying politicise political issue here. Self isolation, hand washing, touching face, social distancing hanging around crowds big part staying safe masks. good news, rn? Reports SARS patients indicate many recovered virus left long-term psychiatric impairments, even prior history mental illness. There's reason believe found true COVID. line ""mental health issue"" ""physical symptom"" blurrier think. Alright then, fuck it, let's open flood gates get back deaths, right? /s ""Ramdev also claimed trial complications patients also cured critical parameters normalised.""

Sorry mean disrespect anyone feels valid words said pile cash sugar water.

The article also states company told stop making claims ""medicine"" properly evaluated. Oh good, people force face can’t ask social distance fear accused weed getting car ripped apart. Lovely. Advocating quarantine hotspots fine,

Thats needed say. 

Until actually lock like have?, understand. messing around point. yes, state states like NJ, CT, CA.. yes better states reaction this. Hopefully change mindset (or total complete LACK thought matter) hopefully change too.

In words, works (or rather, doesn't) praying. even virus temp sensitive anyone paying attention spreads meat processing plants warmer countries time right bat showed get lull. US goes indoors AC keeps nice cool viruses plus indoors breathing everyone else breathing.

the way reduce spread get people wearing masks keep distancing plus handwashing. scientists find spread toilet plume like germs via bad plumbing, SARS apartment building think Hong Kong.

Still waiting quote, way. Less tests increase positive %. 🤷‍♂️ still dont understand SE Asia avoided well. Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand minor outbreaks. something explain it. Granted, much AC there, lot open houses, etc, humid hell. frustrating still fully understand virus operates. 30% kidney issues. 30% HOSPITALIZED cases.

Given 9 million global cases, 30% kidney failure rates, talking ventilators.

My takeaways here. hospitalized this, probably good idea monitor kidney function. 99% people get fine.

Some people, small minority people get right screwed thing. majority people hospitalized, reason believe widespread organ damage amongst survivors.

There's enough evidence would prude check out. evidence supports saying 30% people end kidney problems. profesional athlete prime, hate guy sitting around nothing must insane pro atheles esp. dont know job going back full anytime soon Accessibility important talking supply demand. Relying people make masks viable option. 

The federal govt dropped ball. scapegoat. truth. Take look South Korea handled it. telling public make masks? produce millions upon millions early general public. 

Why people condscending here? Yikes... give time IVs. Nobody seems mind they’re allergic it. It’s difficult enforce. Australia ended putting people hotels police front two weeks. tested everyone paid food/ accommodation. Still one idiot caught leaving hotel WA. WA also great option putting people island quarantine over. 

Not saying NY shouldn’t it- turning point Australia getting control since cases overseas. Kids died Wuhan. Back January. “mysterious new syndrome” neither mysterious new. find western approach (not you, people general) implicitly racist. Like mask debate - opinion life experience billions Asians never mattered? wait American doctors said absolutely necessary? went around telling people didn’t harm kids KNEW killed kids back JANUARY. think understand correlation actually mean.

You're making case politics ""a game"" becomes winning instead actually job Well, yes. Except situations alternative like essential workers. regulation proactive. People gonna stupid long term decisions, gotta regulate. Again, none say secret service. Two weeks what? Yeah, Denmark really low population density include Greenland. really help though. pretty normal/expected harsh viral infection fuck internal organs, sometimes life. Old eliminated diseases left survivors life long damage. Smallpox, polio (nearly eliminated), measles, mumps, rubella, etc... record leaving percentage survivors life long damage.

Most us first world countries lucky/privileged enough face viruses like due vaccination. bit scary new one discovering ways survivors badly impacted long term. anyone know there's divide southern US northern US terms cases?

Serious question, bad job look like? Employers want people catch potentially deadly disease therefore implementing health safety restrictions consequences vioated try lower risk. Employers nothing TTI budget, Danish government shares goal trying keep spread infection low possible. Yeah, they're that. They're random person checks. already establish last week? Also, come young people asthma death rates low? immune system healed took 3+ weeks. Talking unsecure officers beating shit everyone? Ah yeah, see. Daily deaths fallen US too. Even then, billions doses appear thin air. remember originally heard it, heard theory milder cases coronavirus spread lot people hit hardest viral loads isolated hospital unable infect others. I'm taking part Oxford vaccine trial team believe could rolled September/October.

I'm curious if/how change we're opening things up. ""Correlation early face mask usage lower Covid-19 spread rates study shows."" YES. 

Look, get agree cynical comments GOOD THING.  Hopefully implemented well improved upon. businesses flaunting recommendations clientele love (i.e. masks allowed!)

Fine, want frequent support (reward) businesses taking precautions. they? We're Dems desperately hanging electoral votes since win? Clearly know play game underestimated guy. still got way votes anyone giving credit for. I’m afraid virus. I’m afraid willfully stupid people giving virus dgaf. Fortunately, bunch regressives charge! /s (just case clear) dont gain longterm immunity recovery, could bad second bout covid person? quite scary. lesson people one cares except you. Nobody best interests mind except you. 

The next lesson dispel aura competence magically ascribe ""experts"". Think place employment. time, see sizable portion coworkers clocking collect check driven anything bare minimum expected. fact, many barely competent, actually incompetent. office politicking blame distribution, hammer never seems fall them. another sizable chunk coworkers able job, going flow. excelling, innovating, making things better. fact, management decides go wrongheaded approach, ones offer push back. yes men sucking boss. last group actually excellent employees. people go beyond. things knowledge base really driving force behind initiatives succeed. last group minority, rest coworkers kind people would trust lives with...

Now transpose distribution competence onto medical profession. Congratulations! understand doctors people shit adequately competent follow standard care designated practice order limit legal liability minimal continuing education keep ideas left med school (which rushed ""crammy""). cannot hold physician high esteem simply ""doctor"". average worse comes medicine filtered standards committee dispensed protocol, many looked all. goes double public health officials. gone field politics alone tell compromised degree. heard countless health officials buck whatever directive given state state official buck comes DC. hierarchical rare take lead pursue course explicitly directed above. seek political cover ANYTHING. 

You never trust anyone fully. one looking you. research, assume did. don't. different interests you. malice cases, different objectives many barely competent/incompetent waiting liability cover anything goes wrong, point person say directed [insert even higher authority]. current anomaly — rising aggregate infections falling aggregate deaths — exists time lags exposure death.

I would also like think falling deaths due part improvements therapies fact lot cases likely due contact tracing results confirmed positive tests people would previously tested. increased testing result increased cases, overall cases still going faster testing increased spreading more. would like think discoveries treating earlier going prevent many deaths saw before. I'm saying deaths increase, throwing hopefully proportionate large last time saw rise cases followed rise deaths. not. pointing claim ""SARS long term effects"" wrong, zero basis making claiming. 

None whatsoever. single thing know subject made claims about. Contact tracing works, people answer phone questions, [but people also need ask attended protest, [places like NYC protest setting, [young people asymptomatic, contact tracer people almost nothing work 

Bluetooth tracing application might work protest, [but people using long long? Honest question. Although **A** vaccine may 6-12 months away, unless 70%+ comfortable going getting cant control spread anything else distancing. wonder takes 2-3 years okay able see grand mother, grand father, mother, father, immuno-compromised friend 2-3 years? Obviously may choice it'll strong impact psyche goes 2,3 even 5 years. Dr Lecter understood getting at. point we're bad math, point concept extremely difficult visualize, therefore trusting analysis feelings.

In problem, anyone took (and had) time analyze would obviously pick right answer, doubt. Shit People dying know yeah spiraling death numbers still going fuck economy. Florida, hold beer.... pandemic first started, drank like college - every night. partly distraction dread also partly boredom. Work slow/nonexistent. watch much tv walk dogs much.

It’s still early determine specific rate takes place kidneys. certain places, they’re determining 30% kidney problems: article also talks rates issue taking place, well as, lack awareness kidney issues: lung issues appear even frequent. virus affects anywhere body ACE2 receptors locates, people fail realize hear care read headlines death rate/recovery rate lung issues. soooo much virus presented mainstream media. idiotic considering could done Czech Republic ask people make masks home. change balls every point? been 46,735 coronavirus cases reported last 14 days, Newsom said. accounts 36.5% cases. Additionally, hospitalizations increased 16%, ICU patients jumped 11%. positivity rate throughout state increased 4.5% 4.8%. Worse, Los Angeles County, rate spiked 5.8% two weeks ago 8.4% Monday, Ferrer said. title extremely misleading. say ""the European CDC data obviously issue countries"" title much suggests particular Sweden. really say that\

[""By tests, find cases. 25 plus. 25 million tests. Think that, 25 million. Way more, double, triple, quadruple, county. Therefore, test, we're going cases. cases, sounds bad. But, actually, we're finding  maybe stupidity gets purged hard way country better long run it.

Even worst case scenarios like 98% surviv. restaurant Guangzhou travelers Wuhan it. directly air flow around index patient got infected.

My beloved sis next state really try, admitted doesn’t wear mask running convenience store get smokes. Likewise another sibling we’ve seen Instagram eating lot basically whole time, going dinner parent’s house. 

Sadly probably won’t see next year. thought it? course, I’m monster. don’t want this. sucks. I’m going keep it, won’t let anyone house unless they’ve *actually* isolating least two weeks. made half argument 3 separate points comment im sure trying say... live NYC. tell, took things seriously long time — cities. majority population adhered stay-at-home orders, wore masks hunkered 110 days. 

We also didn’t rush reopen state like CA. think locals bigger impact Imagine causes small degree lung damage longer able perform 100%. could lose lot. Yeah except aruvedic medicine suggest cow piss poo treatment disease.

It's right Chinese traditional medicine terms outlandish ingredients lack efficacy. Interesting article. Remember Asians attacked wearing masks?

Masks cannot protect virus unless white people say so. timing dosage critical context. Even turns effective, following original study procedures exactly would put patients even risk dire side effects. Overcrowded hospitals overworked doctors would increase risk improper administration. Asian countries largely avoided steroids based experience steroids poor outcomes original SARS outbreak.

I'm also increasingly skeptical preprints chloroquine retractions. **Source:** data processed using usafacts.org [county Perhaps normal times would interesting theory, pandemic, probably much. Fact March china flew doctors Italy. first thing said. arent people wearing masks heaven's sake. Get masks die. doctors joking given situation faced Bergamo. yes mask shortage. took 10 minutes googling find decent papers effectiveness surgical masks compared n95 doctor. Masks asap. Obviously protests 3 weeks ago nothing it. pointer future conversations, ""I'm racist X"" argument, exactly people trying stop. really arent racist, need defend absurd accusation make merit response. worrying possibility cross infecting children. majority kids health issues.

 say using separate facility, hope allowing nurses staff cross mingle. caught it. feel bad them. *entirely* wrong either. people go ""well I'm wearing mask, I'm protected!"" let guard distancing, probably increased risk. NZ - worked home 3 months. able help kids home learning, able drop pick school month. 5 year old daughter especially loved it. didn’t want go back office. 2nd week back waiting hear permanent WFH reduced office hours opportunities senior leadership team.

In day age internet, reason us office workers stuck office least 8 hours day it’s always way. clearly productive home, option. ""what about"" using number one killer America comparison? big deal guys! compare number one killer America see!

Oh know. ludicrous number there's way anywhere near correct Canada 6 deaths due covid yesterday. lowest since March 29th. directed Fauci CDC assume. Science first. Great, federal government going stockpile yuge amount this.   seem think US resources feed entire population? do. Even covid19. plenty money weather economic impacts.

This question will.  Technically filter resistance N95 masks mmH2O, whereas resistance KN95 generally less 10 mmH2O, that's based response upon.   Ah yes, every single cop America killing people. every one them. isn’t single good cop America. /s thing gets right, see country without doubt knows virus longest experience actually long term absolutely SHITS moment much rears head second. talk miracle cure month, talk unicorn exception magical fix this. lock everyone involved instant. want absolutely nothing thing. react strongly viciously think they're fighting demon. rest world sees this, turn right around keep spewing openituptardism. actually incredible.


What China knows, everyone else feel months. 100%. stupidest part photo mask probably one best ones.

He opportunity look like massive buffoon somehow can't help himself. I'd going without masks United States prepared implement systems [Scandinavian E.g. Digital/medical infrastructure, contact tracing, one major factor sorely lacking universal healthcare entire population major factor Nordic countries enabling fast smooth responses. Kunnamo pointed “It crucial identify everyone connect healthcare providers via eHealth system.” hilariously wild misreading post (and everything know virus). Yeah, see that. like watching someone vape wall water vapor hits face reminded dude's lungs face. someone smoking definitely smell next room over.

Remember dozens medical staff working around known positive COVID patients mainly using N95's plastic face shield protection. working close COVID patients day. rate infection medical staff higher general population, still massive. follow safety protocols, generally going safe.

A mask provides protection weater. depending design wearing it, might good protection. still makes sense wear. Maybe 30% chance getting sick otherwise would have. That's nothing. enough cause risk taking behavior.

Of course understand increased testing reason find many infected now. 

There huge backlog infected people option get tested even increased testing found cases go couple weeks.

The R value however still around 1 3000 Swedes infected every day. guess around 500 found cases month backlog cleared. (It still districts everyone wants gets tested).

A lot surgeries cancelled something Sweden huge problems catch future.

And also se lot people Covid syndrome need treatment future. survive always get 100% healthy Hospitalizations already going LA County, although fast parts state. state whole time high. uptick correlated reopening, protests.

 need figure enforcement. law pointless one enforce it. property disease. seems spread super easily 'normal' situations, effectively right conditions: indoors many people, engaging bodily activity, talking singing. course situation occur anymore lockdown. question probably is, still spread locked down. answer would be, countries still experiencing growth, something differently.

Even prevent situations, situations like shopping hospitals unavoidable. widespread infection, every super-spreading-condition result super-spreading-event. may want answer Thanks, you! :) think increased testing great. wanted point number confirmed cases worth much, comparison wise.


You look ""Development deaths time"" make conclusions That’s quite rare. steroid used like every hospital world everyday. It’s “nasty af” drug all. notice Nature never claims Sweden strategy trying achieve herd immunity. Tegnel speaks thinks herd immunity inevitable end. like saying going die end. mean trying die soon possible.

If look speaks goals Sweden, slowing many countries, aim flatten curve, slowing spread much possible — otherwise health-care system society risk collapse.

This disease stopped eradicated, least working vaccine produced. find long-term solutions keeps distribution infections decent level. sad people actually paid attention economic lessons 1918 pandemic.

Requiring people wear face masks public places has, however, subject controversy isolating effect mask-wearing spread COVID-19 simple. column looks town Jena German regions introduced face masks rest country see whether requirement makes difference number new COVID-19 cases. Requiring face masks worn decreases growth rate COVID-19 cases 40% Germany. Cuomo killed people nursing homes. Also, unemployment system shambles. allow people go work CHOOSE work, don’t pay out. opposed mandating people return work would obligate state pay unemployment benefits.

Reopening state far sinister DeSantis ignorant, I’m afraid. Somebody posts covid figures every day city Facebook group. Even though numbers trending WAY we're best major city country, people read ""X number new cases"" react dramatic post. there's chance going immediately stop drop zero. 

This level ""thought"" we're dealing with. agree. need one. state managed get control. stories lately states recent cluster outbreaks traced state travel infected states bringing home home states. perspective brag wrong Norway strict lockdown instead like Sweden.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fauci U.S. surgeon general. president. U.S. fucked. :( got recovered it, we'd *never* hear end it. would constant tweets either symptoms felt like bad cold. 

So no, think he's it. We'd know. Revenge not, seem like prudent thing considering NY recovered better vast majority states far? evidence yet non-medical masks work looked perspective source prevention rather PPE. call wanting save lives “agenda” happily push agenda day, don’t care knows it.

Yeah, New York functions like Asian country shit together. lol Lex Fridman awesome. long antigens COVID-19 remain same, memory immune cells quickly identify it. problem antigens mutate immune system familiar mutated antigen optimally respond. disease near deadly originally advertised.

The fact media focused cases ignoring lack spike deaths shows focused fear mongering aspect  say ""truthful"" paints writers deliberately deceptive think that's case. I've seen TON articles tell whole story, including one Local link to, many many mainsream Swedish press well. 

I chalk sloppy journalism around event yet clear. 

It mostly true, though, exception Norway opened point Gotland.

Get well soon Novax. predicted around month ago. shitty rag laundered lies, expect blurb Hill everyone else start citing ""reporting"" true. actually interesting, hindsight, anyone thought Sweden's herd immunity policy would anything *other disaster* economy. seems quite clear becoming, one Swedish writer put it, ""Europe's leper colony"" would adverse effect business. guess hindsight 2020 still, obvious. 

Very people countries outbreak control choose vacation one not. even many Swedes forgo traveling due risk. Texas reported one largest rises new cases 24,000 week ended June 21, increase 84% previous week. number COVID-19 tests came back positive state rose 10%, 7%.
New cases Florida rose 87% last week almost 22,000, state’s positive test rate nearly doubling 11%.
Arizona reported 17,000 new cases, 90% increase, 20% tests coming back positive, according analysis. work medical field aren’t worried dying dying THEY’RE crazy ones? OK, sure. considered simply misinterpreted author 1,000 new cases day compares estimated 100,000 peak end March - don’t know exact figure limited testing place.

He probably means 100,000 cumulative cases UK end March.  absolutely unacceptable Fauci part problem making statement. worry many still blame Brexit. Abbott incompetent unfit office. Also, America isnt one state, many states, like NY, PA, NJ, etc pretty much done first wave, states cases decreasing months now. states like Arizona, California, Flordia, etc still first wave. Yeah, shithole Murdoch rag Sooner sooner sooner... NICE problem. clear leadership somewhere like NY following CDC guidance chosen books, hardwork undone another state like FL same. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, would enforced all? Everywhere pass NY get New england mid atlantic/south. Way much traffic constantly moving through.

&amp;#x200B;

It kinda ironic states like RI told police look NY plates opposite happen them. Ohhhh nooo big number make scared! Yea testing capita shot up, they're still around 5% positive hospital beds (relatively) stable. Arizona, all, shot 5% positive 20% positive even ramped testing (and peeps AZ still hard time getting tested) grandmother wheels, she'd bicycle. Something like always going happen people voted guy in. That’s option never want go back place again. not. #Translation:

Summer vacation weeks approaching, travel restrictions, quarantine concerns spread infection leave wet blanket Swedish tourism. dare book trips, either abroad within Sweden tens thousands jobs expected disappear.

""It's big disaster entire travel industry,"" said Didrik Von Seth, secretary general Swedish Travel Agency Swedish Association Organizers SRF.


Swedish tourism sales SEK 337 billion 2018, according Tillväxtverket. year expected significantly lower. travel agency industry expects year's sales international travel reach 10-20 billion, normally 60-70 billion per year.


- Many companies run risk going bankrupt thousands employees become unemployed, says Didrik von Seth continues:


- major disaster entire travel industry. prepared receive tourists Sweden sell trips. complete silence, causes major losses, Sweden throughout Europe.


#Big loss popular Sweden


Sweden popular tourist destination Europe. normal summer, foreign guests account 9.9 million guest nights hotels, cottages, hostels campsites. 2018, foreign tourists consumed SEK 144 billion Sweden. since March year, situation different.


- Reservations hotels campsites much lower foreign tourists. also know many actually complete bookings exist, says Jonas Siljhammar, CEO Visita, industry employer organization Swedish visitor industry.
Holidays Sweden


Many Swedes hoping holiday Sweden, also benefits industries. Holiday rentals increasing, sale holiday homes hotter. Motorhomes caravans increasingly demand.


In 2018, Swedish visitors' consumption accounted SEK 193 billion. according trade employers' organization Visitas CEO Jonas Siljhammar, also bookings Swedish tourists year.


- many places, summer absolutely crucial survival. example, Storsjöyran Östersund set, situation becomes serious. life's work risks destroyed, says Jonas Siljhammar.


Visita also expects around 25,000 summer jobs disappear hotels, restaurants amusement parks gap empty summer, addition permanent jobs 
have already disappeared also risk disappearing. government’s creative way reduce positive results. Geez. 

I hope feels better soon. God! kind warning! Chinese guy also infected someone boarded bus gotten off. rest world lower IFR, perhaps number 29,000 confirmed dead little one speech delay developmental issues. really needs socialization.

Just hearing that, wholeheartedly understand separated that. Ita tournament? America: say? Nah. Funny... realize steaks, bacon, chicken, cheese eggs actually health foods.

I guess u see meat plant workers essential. note lot meat also exported places like China. point bringing up?

In words, yes, due idiots things would still bad -- reason wish could get hands genuine N95 masks protect &amp; family idiots. I'm Maine heard zero cases enforcement. Situations may analogous -- local bullies extraordinarily reliant tourism ugly toward governor restrictions think picking battles. Covid-19 change fact we're living safest time human history.

150,000 people die day around world. Due coronavirus, number 3 4% higher, additional deaths amongst old.

If want see world like 4% fewer people died, go way, way back, way year 2015. global population 4% lower, number people dying coronavirus. Weed sales canada strong.

And no, pandemic isn’t rock bottom IMO. lot depravity way things get righted. good scientist then. It’s fortunate really - commute time, job instability, need wear mask day, working conditions safe can’t contract virus working dont think do, matter...

Its like prisoner first date trying george costanza best convince poor visiting girl cozy Taiwan, right? Every case Taiwan traced tracked. case case number, far 443. However, NY can't check point like China every highway, every communities make sure people outside NY. Americans live this: ""Give Liberty Give Death"". Lol, take look mirror. Yikes... got results. yeah encouraging sign - hard compare numbers exactly cuz many confounding factors - I'm seeing significant rise deaths AZ hospitalizations - know, know, there's lag that, seems like NY comparatively unmistakeable curve - large percent hospitalized people make die days - maybe that's sign treatments improved enough lower IFR? We'll see next days guess.  That's thing IT, problem building, getting necessary work done, enjoy it. everyone else unnecessarily disturbing. Increased number new infections. hope not. Fauci team warned months ago. I'm sure hard work getting sorted soon Covid virus control. They've probably done sums already. also noticed number tests provided last 2 days rather low, compiled data see that's normal Mon &amp; Tue reporting. concern recent narrative ""maybe test much"" followed ahead rally. things people give shelter place/quarantine/ect, heard one person say ""I can't wait go see movie over."" need start making movies people realize traditional movies expendable. Ya, science support protests source. reopening that's it. people indoors ignoring safety precautions. simple that. ESPECIALLY SINCE TRYING INVITE CRAWFISH BOIL guy study telling pump breaks?

In reality definitely something rely on. enjoy waiting line.

If Tulsa indication, may to. list still servers drive thru workers put masks noses. effective. Didn’t add anything address anything? Seems appropriate fucktard sub. Bruh im 17 think someone ever give cash free vax D’oh! Covid Attention people Florida: frustrated Florida, *are* Florida. People started get loose routines, allowing interaction could spread virus. second wave might coming sooner thought. Uh... realize NY lost people per capita almost region world? They're exactly shining example competency. roomie friends smoke sesh joined last Thursday (dumb). found one went bar right before. RIP. feel sniffly I’m hoping don’t it.

Fwiw, I’m leaving anywhere without mask/seeing elderly relatives. Ok, may one situations where, even Covid, deathly ill, it’s reasonable cause listed “did die Covid”. 

I literally someone tell me, “that person died pneumonia, didn’t even die coronavirus.” fans hugged, assume :( Source? Correlation doesn’t prove causation. Maybe masks played part. countries required masks sooner probably also responded proactively areas too. I’m sure could find correlation lot precautions. Still, consensus wearing masks helps it. trying keep headline perspective. It’s people want go Disney vacation acting horribly. Making comments articles unions want like “If they’re scared quit” “they lazy want collect unemployment”. 

They can’t quit, it’s like abundance jobs Orlando don’t involve tourism matches skill set. social safety net people genuinely feel safe risk group choose go back. #1 run database queries complicated troubleshooting software work on. Agree w/ #2. think community policing going work somewhere dense NYC though. Mind blowing. Damn threatening public health officials hell. ""keeping safe distance people"" that's physical distancing. sure, enough data. I've read, beds less issue (plenty surge capacity). Lack staff manage patient care big problem. grandfather fought Vietnam, even says things much easier back then. also immigrant. could work minimum wage McDonalds still able support family. firefighter, police officer, teacher barely food. Job security wasn’t much issue back either I’m told. minority, woman still bad. Education lot expensive can’t work part time job pay anymore.

Obviously yes trade, even trade school expensive. employers require bachelors degree positions too. Honestly, good talking point. Florida desperately try report deaths could get lots mileage. 

However, fucking bad might last long want to. see “Recall Whitmer” bumper stickers Ohio.. like wtf I’m fascinated American politics, American history, American culture. course I’m really interested Covid situation America. wish sub wasn’t USA-centric. lot conversation assumes you’re American. guess it’s curse English Language sites kind. Thats dont think NY levels yet - guess decent chunk positive cases coming ""mild"" cases. 

In NY - testing limited young healthy people couldnt get test unless admitted. guess peak, NY could found 10k cases per day testing today's level. type thing would see comedy sketch. many people know died flu? entire life don’t know anyone died flu. know 1 guy died covid. husbands uncle vent survived. brothers best friend lost dad grandma day died covid.  everyone know someone died covid, may close family member friend everyone somehow affected covid. 

This happened 2 month period. yet 40 years life I’ve never known someone died flu.

But nobody wants let prisoners protect them. We're interested protecting them, we're going let sit jail get sick. title appears misleading. study authors conclude drug ""may influence mechanical ventilation survival outcomes."" claim 87% mortality reduction. appear report patients severe disease survival rate 78% patients severe disease treated drug survival rate 83%.

It death rate wise seasonal influenza. would make say this? Look worldofmeter Yeah that's great point. There's lot uncertainty around virus mechanisms. Unless N95 mask better

WTF wrong U.S.? invoke Defense Production Act get several billion N95 masks manufactured. Every man, woman child wear outdoors. coronavirus would contained could completely open economy.

One tiny place. consider Sweden's largest island, popular tourist destination, one tiny place. now. done you.

You say that, know going reply. true said people. There's probably never going immunity this. mutating virus, much like Flu. going around long time, manageable all. enforcement works--and doubt it, flight passengers only, cars. state may say all, attempt enforce former.

Fauci said it, “ institutional racism contributing poor health outcomes African Americans.” Regarding COVID-19. Removing anxiety list effects NHS tracking pretty counterproductive. Knowing stress COVID-19 enough trigger psychological symptoms means doctors know watch symptoms, prepare patients possible result, make referrals clinical psychologists needed.

There's two things quite topic also need consider:

1. ""Psychological symptoms"" article appears include chronic fatigue, indication related patient's personality. bit surprising see lumped anxiety, that's problem news reporting.

2. fully understand mechanisms virus causes different symptoms see. inferring anxiety secondary result trauma, could direct viral attack brain vasculature. Tracking symptoms, even anxiety, helps us understand virus prior knowing full biological mechanism. comment responded says they're Oxford vaccine trial means already vaccine injected Sounds similar New Jersey trying pissed New Yorkers China India counting deaths huge margin. India barely testing. please go US terrible. thing quoted says 20 30 percent people bad enough hospitalized. world equate 45 percent patients? threaten sue Rhode Island attempting thing? agree represent larger population. disagree use word 'Much'.. put context 9 million people. Wow article informative, thank much!  get double PhD Virology Psychiatry? definately second wave. Toronto, see maybe less 10% people wearing masks. lucky ending like US first wave, people better Americans. also largest prison population world, COVID known spread like wildfire prisons. Care explain how? trying mean fight get someone compromised immune system deal covid19 *better* someone without problem. 

Covid19 regardless compromised immune system means get sick easier/have symptoms harder healthy (non comprised) people right? 

I could see making comprised non compromised equal footing biologic drugs surpassing someone problems all.

Again question. way argument. Want understand thing. dont understand forward thinking became taboo..

Instead organizing food essentials next year people thinking masks help AC environment many people spend half day hate tell this, Americans, complicated.  good portion teachers older. say none could affected virus way, including death, blind saying will. problem schools operated way disease illness easily take advantage of.

Honestly watching Canada gobsmacked horror. Deaths dropped dramatically California. Half deaths nursing homes. 

Increased case count expected re-opening plus protests. 

It cause concern Covid related ICU admits increase. Put bunch people may coronavirus room together bunch people may not. could possibly go wrong?

I said thing HR department ""employee testing blitz"" last week put everyone training room get antibody test.

Some people never got anything nasty headache. Others lost sense smell two weeks, get cough. Still others got bruises feet turned blood infections causing micro clots (the ""Covid toes"" described ago.)

Not surprised. He’s high risk too. another brainwashed jack arse. see potential lot misinformation one.

Air filtration *can* remove aerosols containing virus. way discussions go, people try draw clear black-and-white line say ""You're safe"" ""You're safe"", base arguments specific aspect system.

However, let's remember ideal perfect ventilation filtration system - one provides high rate turbulence around every participant - would windy loud one would able hear anything. would feel like trapped vertical wind tunnel lot people.

But course, assumes anti 1% movements trying achieve total equality trying simply level things degree. short, strides probably made trying get rid wealth inequality probably futile exercise. Right has. Things change quickly. debates interesting. fun article. think?

But yeah, guess prime minister Norway would speculative source. mean, would know actions Norway? /s current leadership USA made us pariah world. lot people say need go back work pay rent, pay bills, etc. That's failure government, providing affordable healthcare, failing provide disaster relief impacted virus.  

I know many people convinced solution go back work safe (spreading virus putting health health families communities risk) taxpayers every right expect government job lead us pandemic. Stark blood good donation, Red Cross free antibody test every blood platelet donation. F yes Florida.

I feel bad anyone dumb enough NY plates happens. There's massive population NY owns property comes every year. shit bad NY Cuomo threw shit fit anyone wanting anything state's residents. that's politics you. one days cares actually works. ways Cuomo's done good job ways he's clearly playing politics.

Anyone focused stopping thing could've seen ""Hey, maybe figure quarantine strategy states things get worse"" back March. states (not necessarily governors, least officials) could've started brainstorming ideas put together framework this. course federal help would've benefited too.

I hate stupid comments. Y'all realize lot us horrified, yeah? majority people might morons, blame rest us bullshit. There's much neither masks quarantine mandated enforced right state. Covid-19 proves unhealthy country is.  look countries faired. perfectly healthy people put lives careers halt majority country doesn’t take care themselves. Denmark opened border Sweden yet, infection level Skåne continues rise. 

Then won't. 

Norway nice reuniting border towns Sweden. Insane. Even plateaus 3-4,000, probably best case scenario, don’t see hospitals able keep up. He's learned play game order good. completely honest, would gone replaced someone worse. ceding ground administration, gets stay position much good can.

It sucks, far better bailing leaving us deal Trump-appointed successor. we're fully ready re-open, despite government wants.

Well first politburo, exactly 1 person, called paramount leader hold power forever, importantly, actually respected leaders believe science, ya, good luck pandemic think differences cases really reliance public transportation shutting earlier.

Restricting movement asking people quarantine 14 days entering state 2 different things. doesn’t take 100% infected herd immunity. amazing thing yet people understand things stay same, could third party.. know extreme left right throw wrench sides bullshit. Kentucky, seems plenty anti mitch sentiment right Lol Better vaccine fully researched tested rushed one would lead unknown consequences. Oh totally fine Ducey says 300 National Guard going contact tracing!

We're screwed. well known narcissistic liar 2016 Nah, one organized Croatian coast Đoković's incentive Croatian Serbian govornment. lot people shit bed particular incident question. Well didnt said vaccine all. medicine Yeah I'm quarantines see tough. That's need really lock truly non-essential travel visits focus quarantining people actually need hospital. much easier state local resources provide aid actually need blanket quarantines anyone.

But tough state. Even though lockdown orders still place CA, virtually over. roads busy hell now. crucial Americans got protest. many people know head many positive tests US? I'm assuming nearly nobody. people good idea death total, though. That's number matters. can't understand fewer tests would help look better.

Oh endorsing haha, can't remember took exactly figure engaging way teaching us people would've chosen first place know gotta wear masks heat it’s gonna brutal . It’s 85-90 NY can’t handle minutes . wasn’t hot could wear day Alaska territory. Can't wait stocks gas prices continue go tomorrow! Meanwhile joy figuring pay rent get evicted! Yay! Whew lawd fucked beginning then. get point. doubt mind masks help stop spread covid. 


I’m questioning study there’s many variables can’t toss hard separate. matter feel, real impacts real costs impact businesses, governments, individuals alike. impact COVID *is* managed, recognize cost ($ otherwise) spread widely. Austrian cluster infect Europe? Skiers Italy went Austria, Austria went literally everywhere else. Yeah, guys great job.  charge though? Maybe keep NY’ers fucking NY Vermont NH. thought. Modern journalism exercise committing logical fallacies. exposed 100 random whites 100 random minorities, would certainly get *infected* rates.  exposure risk IRL different, that’s minorities inherently *susceptible* virus. thing I’m “thin-skinned” accuracy. Yeah pretty much individualism. want maintain personal freedom choice fucking fault. matter wearing mask -- something fucking simple minor inconvenience -- greatly helps others. 100% clear demonstrable effect individual, it. completely idiotic, unfortunately that's narrative here. Individualism everything opposed collectivist attitudes much popular parts world. NY Gov RI Gov couple months ago: can't force NYS Residents quarantine.

Gina: Shit right -- ok, new rule, EVERYONE quarantine. ^(But we'll enforce cars come southern border) Even dont turn zombie, living world. effects everyone. I'm layman ""suppressing cytokines"" exactly thing suppressing immune response? something want non-critical patients early stage patients need immune systems?  thank try that. ...then precisely arguing, saying let poor people die. fair, went partying together evening before, multiple pictures players hugging etc.

Also, seeing shit went two days ago, there's real posibility Đoković got independently tournament. tests can't recognize infection three days, virus enough time spread system. Serbia seeing around 80 new cases week now. Well honest yes, different now, one thing moron lies get it, another thing moron lies years obviously worries instead worrying citizens 120k+ people die 2.3m get sick pandemic. high school teacher husband asthma young daughter pneumonia past winter, I'm terrified. students knowingly coming school fevers symptoms could play week's basketball game/wrestling tournament/etc. would later test positive flu B. I'm sure they'll treat COVID differently. saying yesterday city opening mostly safe. place less crowded local. need ""hoax"" states coming visit. worked hard city back like EU can't come ignore science. US Canada basically sibling countries, there’s huge overlap Canadian American culture discourse. it’s really accurate say Canada nothing worry about. Vit immune system well known, well researched easy fix supplementation changes diet fit narrative ignore it......while people die. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* too, less half mile me. He'll busy today, Twitter flagged another Tweet him. yeah read Reddit people seem wear masks way us places Europe (can't speak countries obviously), like social distancing much either. would good statistics exactly people tend contract virus, perhaps fundamental differences way socialize something guarantee barely anyone wears mask Switzerland unless required law, also rare. Yeah that's exactly people acting. I'm wondering exactly going take idiots take seriously. LOL condoms man long feel like county testing enough sure there's many infections would say go now. lot infections yet only, potential get worse; might well go things lower. much read studies cited? quote discussion first key findings &lt;50% participants adherent mask use intention-to-treat analysis showed difference arms. Although study suggests community use face masks unlikely effective control policy seasonal respiratory diseases, adherent mask users significant reduction risk clinical infection. Another recent study examined use surgical masks handwashing prevention influenza transmission also found significant difference intervention arms

In words:

1. People wear masks. start, give up. makes ineffective. 

2. this, mask wearing explicitly stated likely viable public health tool.

3. Yes, rigid adherence mask wearing reduce risk transmission environment likely cause (such extended contact infected individual). is, fact, *precisely advice given early on*: wear mask caring someone suspected COVID19. fact, look WHO's [website March healthy, need wear mask taking care person suspected 2019-nCoV infection.

You inadvertently proved point. science said mask wearing helpful people rigidly adhere it, regular, close contact infected individuals. situation healthcare workers find in, *not* situation average Joe walking community. aside, links really weird Youtube referral thing going on.

From second normal wearing scenario, PD reduced 33.6 per cent highest expiratory speed shortest separation distance considered. natural leaks around facemask provide pathway aerosols reach susceptible's mouth. large reduction PD indicates leakage cannot neglected normal wearing practices.

In words: normal use cases, protection quite low surgical masks. such, public policy ask everyone wear one, benefits would quite limited.

Please note: People forbidding anyone wear masks. advice lack advice wear one, active advice *not* wear one (even though there's actually evidence harmful, especially know properly take one thing we're talking ""being contagious showing symptoms"". refer asymptomatic pre-symptomatic.

Thanks proving point. No, asymptomatic *not* presymptomatic. perfect example media reporting something ""general public"" (*e.g.*, you) picking truth. little back brief controversy discussing two, people got quite confused various terms meant, accusing flip flopping. Presymptomatic means yet developed symptoms, will. Asymptomatic means develop true official CDC pages never explicitly said ""masks nothing general public""; however, instances health experts/authorities making exact claim, several articles circulating quoted saying reason people wear masks amounts pure superstition. Example: article incorrect time published. Yes, people obsessed masks point *were* primarily superstition abundance scientific evidence. That's point I'm making here. big part if, places biggest Memorial Day gatherings ones getting hit right now. 

That's remotely true, would even know states types memorial day gatherings? states already trending right around memorial day. tell NJ, pretty much every one know going weekend gatherings weeks. little single Monday off. accurate. goal cases drop; cases keep going every day, every day new record, matters. However, every day new record, fluctuates, new 'record' day every week so.  Sounds like good idea, ever happen. police hardly enforce social distancing policy without selective mean racist profiling No, actually gone down.  protest also done outside. Lmao right? Oh, wow, thanks! Yeah, problems solved now!

As moving expensive shit, especially middle pandemic, mention family ties lot people here. This. mfw Malaysia better Singapore lmao can't. Parlement stripped power years ago. reasons less effective general public, people they're almost useful. That's happens massive hordes violent thugs gathering public destroy communities plague spread respiratory droplets. even name AIDS Tour? People endanger listening right wing leaders pandemic, need educated protected. course. COURSE......

........but MAYBE......... Yeah people shitting Florida thread states/countries lose shit reasonable precautions tried. Yup. direct proof feel like there’s way governors playing like don’t know it’s matter time blows faces. They’re actively choosing money lives safety, weird considering long run sets back further. 

Again proof, level they’re surrounded medical experts receiving somewhat regular briefings situation bad get. random internet strangers Reddit saw coming mile away there’s 0 excuse elected official see it. read comment responding to, thanks checking. I'm gonna argue you. Kids spread thing dudeeee. Kids spread teachers, teachers older, yes obviously small percentage people die larger percentage die hospitals get overrun. discounting human fucking life? teachers families bringing home to. Kids much know behavior schools affect everyone around them. idk panties bunch, fucks sake. Johnny snot nose hopefully heard mom important using tissues germs COULD make someone deathly ill. forget, death one outcome. Severe illness still horrific much greater percentages friend still know long term virus do. speaking like crystal ball. 

And think second districts planning, public school teacher, schools plan final outcome two different things. tried keep group 18 young lives healthy cess pool environment? classroom goes 60 90 degrees given day. simultaneously 20 degrees warmer cooler different parts building. faith buildings vent system faith every single school funds implement failproof plan including updates training needed. probabilities here. 

Btw schools making final plans end July. gives district ehh 3 fucking weeks pull everything together. Hire staff, train everyone. telling every single thing needs go right, go right? spread consequences. underestimate base, Hillary made mistake too. go vote. 

Joe really charismatic guy. career politician exciting water. People really need hating Trump come November Joe get votes. Wow isn’t full 180 even enforced?

What's stopping someone say, PA going new York state chilling friends, example? Roadblocks every street including side roads? Welcome team reality. sad sober reading publicly available data gets labeled ""conspiracy theorist"" parts, yet unfounded/unsourced accusations covid cover ups Florida Georgia reflexively upvoted. severely immuno compromised still going physical service? Technically Trump trying soooo astounded people thinking pandemic ideal time vacation Read article, maybe situation, they're debating 2 lists US dosnt meet new case per 100k criteria neither.

Its foregone conclusion pretty obvious one that, mean US mean, 30k cases day... Understandable, nice day won’t need removing post. fucking ridiculous! wait get worse implementing measures stop spread? Reminds tell kid ""don't that, fall down"" respond ""why? I'm falling"", right fall. SMH! ""Competent"" funny way say ""dictatorial."" Vantastic! better slow spread

That herd immunity. Locked people get immunity agree everything said I’ve trying isolate well. Unfortunately country rugged individualism going end us.

Btw- guilty got corrected - it’s pandemic. word means global. isolated would epidemic. 

Sending lots love prayers! VACCINE? ever one?!!!! Correct I’m wrong, weren’t state overflowing hospitals? Who’s braindead? mentioned article, FDA June 17, 2020, FDA contacted Eskbiochem recommend company remove hand sanitizer products market due risks associated methanol poisoning. date, company taken action remove potentially dangerous products market.

source: nothing personal.

Protection community endevour, longer vaccine takes communities forced relax measures. vaccine get developed simply put, matter well protect ourselves, becomes inevitiability. New Yorker, seen tourist even till now. wife bought tickets September stay 3 days. particularly feasible see barb conservative governors mocking NY. foreseeable future Yeah without electoral college mob rule would something crazy like elect reality tv star experience government 

Everything electoral college made prevent....it caused. 

You can't tell better country Gore instead Bush. 

Maybe time stop labeling Americans citizens ""a mob""? implicit distrust citizens know what's good flawed 

Majority American citizens knew Trump would shitty president 

And he's president way 

Time ditch system gave us 9/11, Iraq war, economy crashing TWICE pandemic Also....anybody elses crime stats gone recently?

Now covid criminals deal with....holy shit. agree state's cases undergone steady increase, perhaps first associated testing later reopening. Maybe early tell, spike last days, seems [driven part LA Hospitalizations also begun tic upwards LA long downward trend. 

That said, seem dangerous outbreaks happening San Joaquin Valley, plenty back forth LA SJV. 

I'd say early may end difficult discern linked protests. Hehe. like you. You’re on! :-) Ha! story makes day. source read it? Hawaii definitely enforcing it. register entering state checking people accommodations.

NY using trackers, wont effective many roads state are. rely assumption people willingly oblige arrests violators set expectation get caught arrested fined. Like laws - make them, expect people follow them, - risk arrest. Fear arrest fine caught usually deterrent hard enforce laws pretty effective people. Even 50% compliance better compliance. hope tell go quarantine nursing home It’s reported lot. people known “long-haulers” they’ve discussed while.[meet Last Several Months disease’s “long-haulers” endured relentless waves debilitating symptoms—and disbelief doctors ""don't understand"" coronavirus ""long-haulers"" symptoms I've seen both. think signs highway urge. really matter though enforced whatsoever honestly care less dealing personal consequences actions. I'm afraid ""I'm sick Covid"" crowd become ""You're sick Covid stood 2 inches behind supermarket without mask"" crowd. ""i'm sick dealing kid got covid me"" crowd that's many Americans died many going forward. could testing place *January*. could control. know getting numbers...

Current Rates worldwide according google: 
9.1m infected  472k deaths = 5%

In united states: 
2.36m infected 122k deaths = 5%

The overall infection rate likely 10x confirmed tested numbers. = 0.5% death

 assume taking confirmed ""recovered"" comparing deaths good comparison. I'd give point half thought bunch people running claiming trial, that's happening own. Hey I've got problem suggesting. NY quarantined, absolutely. long saying FL, TX, AZ, CA, etc also shut I've got problem that.

I pointing hypocrisy here. Cuomo want state cut entry/exit (ill-advised may been) saying wants Florida cut entry/exit. Saying would hypocrisy. wanting thing Florida Hawaii were/have hypocrisy. anything would hypocritical states complain it.

Was stupid quarantine NY? Yes, every bit stupid quarantine states outright refusing follow even basic guidelines today despite insane increase cases. hypocritical want thing states doing? even slightly comparison absurd best outright disingenuous worst. Common sense frowned upon guess lol covid toes side effect. reaction not... think leaving country self defense point. Hi, Im hoping help understand errors logic. Im tracking coronavirus data looks like clearly headed back toward situation stay home orders required again.

Yesterday, daily corona virus cases increased 50% vs last Monday's daily cases (31,496 vs 20,722 per time, hospitalizations increased 3% Sunday Monday (27,718 28,490 per data [The Hospitalizations decreasing 10% per week week 6/8. flat since.

Hospitalizations seem lag new virus cases week. People test positive stay home week hopefully get better dont, go hospital. likely see hospitalizations increase substantially week since cases really started increasing last week.

We know important overload hospitals. hospitalizations increasing dramatically, option require stay home orders slow spread. implement 3 weeks advance due lag time infection hospitalization needed.

Heres holes think of, none compelling:

1. people getting sick younger wont require hospitalization. true seems like matter time increase sick young people start infecting older people
2. able manage illness better death sentence more. words, big deal get sick stay home wont required. dont know true seems unlikely
3. close enough vaccine going race finish line hope doesnt get bad then. think best case vaccine Sept/Oct virus could really get control left unchecked then.

The data Ive put together available input Im concerned going back stay home would mean Nobody thought number confirmed cases cases country. new information. Another thing keep climbing dead/million.

Well, unless find way bring people back dead inevitable. number dying week going though. Looks like overtake Italy Spain within month 3rd country world dead.

Maybe. countries slowed infection rate much have. Cops known fabricate charges without incentive money. Give incentive, it'll crazy. Unless video, ID, go. Californian checking in. like New York fine. that's settled, go back wrong stuff wrong about. Thanks. I'm testing via international vpn servers link works well although think may staggered. don’t agree. He’s position thinks good. leaves he’ll become another one many, shouting others stay home isolate. might swallow tongue every then, good position he’s in, stops someone worst taking spot. 500k said nothing 1 3 figure likely prove imprecise. 

As mentioned, I’m simply dismayed people willing roll dice stems ignorance knowledge. 

The wisest people know least. don’t know everything know virus neither experts. Therefore proceeding family’s sake do, sort misplaced confidence won’t big deal one us catches it. Ok, spread people came contact with? Thats information need, COVID works. one cases, seems goes everyone u interact basically, specially knowing quarantined etc. tried get test here? actually pretty difficult. Wait times around 3-5 hours usually drive sites earliest appointments make 2 weeks out. I'm pretty sure there's little evidence right post-COVID fibrosis affects go intensive care units disease. I'm also pretty sure young people one the, the, least represented group severe cases COVID. yes, careful, could get sever case. Protect elders loved ones. Respect 2 meter distance wear masks much possible. let's paranoid, we're nearly much risk demographics mask you’re running. Masks worn you’re going places people. 

I always carry mask regardless.  parties inherently suck.

We hypocrites invent dumb wrong reasons reject candidate.

Lol look records

People propaganda well yes would considering news think going NYC cases still trending long term scars lockdown also last life particulary affect social anxiety children years come.


The long term scars lockdown vs long term scars watching  elderly relatives die parents suffer damage rest lives. First, (if any) countries lockdowned. Secondly, hope agree scars would worse.




A lockdown can be defined as emergency protocol implemented authorities prevents people leaving given area. full lockdown will mean that people given area must stay must exit enter building given area. tragic federal leadership advocating widespread mask use. 

It would wonderful leadership heard scientific expertise acted accordingly, instead simply questioning science itself. actually interesting, started say ""I think so"" raw scientific answer, paused, gave thought, gave clear concise answer. always try underline African Americans affected disproportionately due large part essential workers front lines getting larger dose virus due front lines. matter laws have, going make sure 

Officials react facilitate punishment breaking laws. people obey — don’t.

The law command nature, implied punishment following it. Yet powerful manifestation law lies fact overwhelming majority follow laws would even absent fear punishment — feel law just, representative society’s best interest, applies everyone equally.

You don’t compliance, fundamental breakdown — law, police, government, society. there? that's question asking.  Think biologic something keeps immune system level, rather something lowers it. pointless, gotten message now, they're going getting period. new normal long while, meanwhile countries world getting past getting lives. disappointing :\[ "" *An estimated 8.7 million Americans likely COVID-19 March, went undiagnosed due insufficient testing* "" Common sense never held drs level... Wearing mask nose effective wearing condom balls. it! ""My neighbors liars Mr policeman havent social distancing, fact threw huge party""

I dont get doesnt become said/she said situation. way really works fully without massive changes laws. Basically discourage never able fully enforced guess do. BFE? yeah cases rising due casino openings etc Death rate wise, stronger flu, primarily 40+. death rate 18-39 demographic closer flu still greater. children, they're likely die flu. usage word 'stronger' imply death rates same, really feel saying stronger mark all. drugs prevent cytokine Thanks info this. haha username checks out, thanks spot. Ok cool. understand. Thanks! Back wiping packages? Remember Trump suggested thing Cuomo threw hissy fit? guy taking credit ""beating"" virus home state damn fault virus spread county. travel family members place mid Atlantic New England. pass weekly NY never actually stop there. Also dont think NYS anywhere near infrastructure create data base tracking every license plate passes analyze movement.

Oh, surprised NY capability plate EZPass database.

It's even hard really, crossing/camera location, plate/EZPassID, timestamp - almost trivial track movement.

Already used recreate/document movements accused, presented evidence court.

Has also used /Real Time/ Police pursuits PD lost vehicle.. magically re-appears crossed bridge. got guy.  12 years ago, one case. Stands mind among first police uses EZPass NYC. Yeah, unoriginal American Oxford researchers.

\s Apparently also bad absorbed skin, news Causes moderate skin irritation. Harmful absorbed skin. Prolonged and/or repeated contact may cause defatting skin dermatitis. Methanol absorbed skin, producing systemic effects include visual disturbances. 

But ingestion worst, sure. ""if"" covid affects brain exact point iNFEctiOns SPring bREak.. dderrrr lockdowns. people do. Lol. Stick stone age much progress going happen. Exactly.. noone wants to.. wtf arguing price cupholders? always way. Unfortunately, much US seems deaf likelihood. uncle Pete test subject vaccine, Ill go ahead listen. get hopes much. AFAWK, still 2x likely catch it, comparable worse time - go cytokine storm. need friends waited 5 hours Orlando convention center yesterday. sick. required get tested going back jobs reopening. wonder many also line sick causing genuinely wait hours hours.There must better way? Actually folks get tested better. Right data problem don’t hard data. Knowing doesn’t also paint better picture kind crisis we’re looking at. story seems one supportive sick rona arguements everything seen knew was, work way. People get infected people encountered become infected, people end really sick. absorbed skin. Huge discounts life time passes since probably won’t around next year use bioterrorism police force. 

Call government officials write use bioterrorism people dislike disagree with. Yeah, propped artificially farm subsidies paid states like New York. Masks also cure cancer too, grant wishes.

So wear them. Wife nurse rural part CA definitely Trump country. experience similar. loved ones risking families lives daily dipshits think masks infringement rights. 

COVID proven need move. convinced I’d wait till kids grown up, naw. We’re surrounded ignorance I’m sick it. Well, Im worn stay home shit....especially hot summer....

Eventually will, like many probably have, say fuck it, venture normal things...but wear mask try play keep away....

and come home Covid? Well, fuck then. Game over. Visitors flight really though? people live surrounding states work NY / NYC? unfortunately, can't wait get back home! look Maine, home state. tried, former Governor got President come encourage courts block quarantine constitutional basis. We're tourist economy, we're kind fucked either way, longer control rely good nature people come spread us.  get wayback machine: article ranks usa 24 31. fucker come times day eat, drink, rub annoying piece ear

That's says ""Do eat drink **in situation need mask.**"" can, eat, drink otherwise remove mask sufficient social isolation/precautions need mask times, wash hands first.

Of course, always possible get environment need mask taking off. yes, choice increase infection risk others yourself, shame. Oxford vaccine prevent single infection animal testing stage. UNDERSTAND subjected levels virus human likely subjected to, announce results whole lot ""grain salt"" language, promising. None monkeys developed pneumonia, positive outcome, think Oxford vaccine going one allows world go back things virus. disease kill many ways could still irreparable damage several organs. benchmark vaccine prevention infection, reduction certain symptoms. thats viable. countries can't maintain precautions indefinitely. longer vaccine takes, countries forced relax measures. vaccine never made, always possibility, simply going prove impossible anyone indefinitely protect themselves.

Protecting sufficient, defending infection always community effort.. rest world stops trying efforts vain. way fast enough catch unicorn!  understanding too. 

Although full diabetes, experienced chronic fatigue severe blood sugar fluctuations blood sugar control problems lasting year half severe flu 20. Shortly H1N1 got two days fever nothing else.

It's unpredictable long term damage viral infection every sickness less roll dice - definitely want roll dice something bad covid though, seeing cascading multi-systemic effects. Nope. Found this: also found rates mask-wearing differed race ethnicity. Communities color reported likely taken important step; 82% Asian Americans, 71% Latinos 74% African Americans said wearing mask scarf, 66% whites said same. 

 

Not surprising really. people complain lockdown wearing masks reflect this. Goddanm would go new York paid million dollars. 

You know public transit got you? 

Rats size squirrel's. 

Hard pass. 

What fucking shithole. upper respiratory viral infection March led shortness breath, worst headaches I've ever had, eventually severe heart palpitations. ER doctor told Covid since fever, cough signs viral pneumonia. released thought going die next days. recurring symptoms, usually shortness breath since then. started taking Pepcid AC seeing articles used treatment Covid. started taking feel symptoms coming far, felt close 100% better following day. Even Covid, pretty certain experiencing post-viral inflammation. Pepcid AC (famotidine) decrease inflammation BP. looking treating people coming Covid, may effective people recovering inflammation.  Yea y'all getting slammed flu season therefore pretty masked hand, right? heard bad y'all year.

Tbf, japan needs thrown data sets. seems pretty obvious govt's slow response done order keep olympics on, really trust numbers? someone please summarise article ? deaths still rising, virus doomers predicting states started opening up, see mobs rioters looters ignoring restrictions precautions, tearing civilization down.

Yes, think .5-.7%. going come young people spreading higher rates now. knows way shift people's attention back COVID-19 now. Indeed. ridiculous. like, serve me, inflated ego, need affirmation dig someone like. 

I mean, disagree like adults guys get work done, whatever heck Congress call names hopes get known biggest kid playground. Good Lord infuriating see nonsense. Can’t make changes state keep moving away. don’t get wiped plague I’d like stick around help good. It’s sad, lived Brazil I’d probably happy take gamble vaccine trial. buddy told thinks political.

Big deal him, retire never work day life (or kids' lives, kids' kids' lives, or...). feel bad high school college players get nothing scholarship, forced go back school fall, might catch COVID-19, never able pro career. Well challenge statement bc seems like lot EU countries close mid march also stated opening late April/early USA political system state governments charged determining things like lockdowns. Illinois locked March 20th remained lockdown May 26-with gradual lifting Mask wearing also mandated. least locked longer EU countries. course state governments acted differently-but plenty locked long longer several EU countries lets hope works well broader tests !

it could better version vaccine could help massively !

when conclusive end results available ? First case 2019 Can’t imagine many cases popping FL now. People keep saying it’s Miami shit hitting Tampa hard now. Probally ten thousand day July. true? number tests done week compared last? decisions, would assume could speak authority about. 

Your camp even consider Swedish strategy worth seriously speculating about, article funny me. feel bad, pictured Simpson's character Nelson laugh. (the one points says Ha-Ha nasally voice). keep bosses happy put yes man place.

Don't see problem though? keep happy, they'll replace someone does. End result is, end someone role keeps bosses happy.

If that's he's doing, that's replacement would do, principled approach try keep hands steering wheel? worked telecommunications construction company workers mostly state would go home weekends. don’t see self-enforcing quarantine. people work tell upper management go fuck expect stay weeks time. completely agree them.

The city Dallas asked federal government extension beyond June 30, refused, Vaz said.

“They told us clearly going extend it,” Vaz said. “We expecting continue beyond June 30, things change.” OK fed bail zombie companies prevent stock market disaster. saving lives testing?

People keep saying this, where's evidence? 

Can see positive impacts Fauci had, despite still playing nice Trump co? seems he's done disservice us calling Trump bullshit. He's also mark things. reason gets pass people assume intentions good despite pandering politicians. yet, still think wearing masks form oppression opening right thing do. third party would absolutely best people, media (on sides) STRONGLY pushes us vs mentality, push “A vote third party simply vote enemy” narrative. problem media owned at&amp;t, Comcast, Disney, Murdoch brothers. billionaires sole agenda remaining billionaires. longer point anger eachother, longer missing point actually making decisions ruining lives. third party enemy billionaire class it’d actually help tear people away manipulation that’s done billionaires global scale.

However, I'm sure plenty people mild cases (and maybe even know coronavirus all) developed chronic fatigue syndrome result. 

That even develop flu, I'm guessing virus probably likely cause it.

'fReE mUrIcAn' need understand viruses work. cannot spread 100% population. Even 50% stretch happens extreme circumstances.

If completely ignore coronavirus let go unchecked would probably ultimately infect 20-40% population.  Next January hopefully protection goes away. negligence, stupidity, laziness greed, seems like entering genocide territory. lot states showed solidarity protesters spreading virus. Maybe pandemic. [And they're adding TMC3 truly incredible. bad fatigue contracting mononucleosis virus still bad Florida done long time ago. getting vacationers thousands everyday you’re saying quarantine rules enforced? Well shit Sherlock. dozens us!

For real, know mean. hard keeping depression bay. really love Lakeland active community based events, pandemic really started skew perception wrong direction. Hey guys, I've away subreddit 5 weeks. meta changed still saying overblown? Good. Anyone goes Disney World right ridiculously stupid. bunch Orlando restaurants closed today.  article see gem headline: ""[DeSantis says ‘grim reaper’ come businesses disregard coronavirus "" 

DeSantis moron. rush reopen, downplayed virus. he's shocked people following rules, seem taking seriously himself.  INCreasED TeSTing! Well fucking duh?  
Reopening coupled weeks protests that.   
California ashamed themselves. Damn shit age well.. Thought hospitals fine? Deal. Yep. went florida 2 weeks work middle everything. drive NJ. state border blocked everyone highway state (you may heard news pain ass. 10-12 miles sitting 2-3 mph), fill sheet asking covid symptoms, going, made sign saying would leave place 2 weeks. follow it, completely unenforceable unless used security cameras find cars plate flag pulling over. think it’s close 80 days factory.

American exceptionalism Spain's antibody test looked past infections people incentive lie, still 35% true asymptomatics (as opposed 50% mildly symptomatics), course, possible people symptoms forgot.  Basically zero risk death someone age health. Lucky timing, getting way now, long Open.

I’m obviously blaming fauci know seems trying best. Yeah, countries acted stupid mid march. paid heavy price preventable deaths hcs breakdown several regions EU. Unfortunately US chose act stupid today. reason must protect societies, even many us miss Americans. Well happy hear federal government ending support testing sites like Texas shutting next week.

Can't positive cases test *taps head tbh places take details find cas someone flight ends infected. 0 chance - will, fact, sports year, matter optimistic leagues get. dozens cold viruses *that haven’t developed herd immunity to*. 

And yes, measles insanely high R0. haven’t developed herd immunity it, like haven’t cold-causing viruses would take lower percentage. 

What viruses developed natural herd immunity to? mean shit America months ago.

When US partially closed borders cries racism xenophobia. don’t think that. U.K. lockdown required boost healthcare capacity. 9 days. mainstream media social media put fear god people, pressured gov maintaining stricter lockdown believe required. PM getting sick prob influence.  like moment teachers stopping kids go school scientist. Science says it’s safe teachers/unions staying isn’t. Nope. evidence. nonsensical correlation studies hundreds unknown confounding variables. fact, several countries (Norway, Denmark, Finland, New Zealand etc) prove masks irrelevant. go put little mask on. I'm sure it'll help really want to! Thanks Coronavirus sub. Tens millions Americans lost job likely health care coverage. since many health care coverage includes family, amount uninsured people country result shutdowns going cause serious problems. probably like 5-10% 

If sick enough need hospital care likely damage. That's born again. Even asympto people damage. got really ill year, feel better. know covid, brain fog till week.

Also Fauci said ""cautiously optimistic"" vaccine might available. Many vaccines fail phase 3 trials know rapidly find people, innoculate them, follow see offers protection reduced severity.

End year would miracle frankly. It’ll still reduce visitors, point. People traveling NY business excuse to. Here’s thing. extra expenses. Whether it’s higher utility bill home day, delivery fees groceries necessities, new electronic means progressing life (a computer continued education example), fact people making totally justified. adds up. Jokes them, manager also short blond hair seem misconception masks work. face, touch done them. late that. Trump quoted today saying ""I kid"". admits joking. know whether I've COVID mental issues run amuck since Feb/March. Fingers crossed get it, livable compared this.  turn tables trauma disorder quite severe points. think depends we're recovery.

Among people trauma disorders know, definitely know people descended serious crisis states. also know one person unfortunately taken life.

Those us along recovery think actually uniquely well. I'm saying affecting -- is, quite badly. definitely worst I've couple years. already know everything that's coming bigger toolbox managing unusually bad circumstances, I'm getting caught guard like people developing trauma first time, struggling stay water extent people early recovery less stable going it.

For first time life, part feels blessed came crisis better prepared survive horror show people are. deep conviction live anything point, that's keeping afloat.

But definitely extremely sad watching many people develop trauma first time -- half planet, seems. wish could I've path, there's many them, even begin? agree understand virus already out. America world superpower, along best researchers medical experts available. current cult government listen them. leading shit show may ask... Jared fuckim Kushner. 
P.S 6 months since Covid19 discovered still can't find masks cleaning supplies American shelves. yes, would say again, fuck Trump fuckin cult! yeah wheres $1200? Trade war Camembert Parmigiano cheese ? one masks? aware deaths spiking right?

Is last bastion covid deniers?

Deaths peaking (due several reasons) now, hospitals currently process overwhelmed. current end sight, guarantee deaths soon follow horrible trends seeing across US. actual makes zero sense. We’re Canada teens asked Canada’s wonderland would open, that’s solid nope 

These amusement parks function loads ppl attending, crammed together rides, waiting line etc etc, plus army staff support keep park running - even able social distance guests staff, operating costs would bankrupt within week

*When goods cross borders, soldiers will.* Pelosi literally said people go Chinatown European leagues restarted without major incidence. clearly case Novak reckless. long leagues take safety measures hard expect resurgence virus within circles. measles, requires specific conditions transmission avoid 99% time + continuous testing, nothing happen. think people know bother look history behind recommendations lack thereof....we masked 1918 little else, investigations afterwards showed mixed best effect masks, WWII west abandoned them. countries shown major improvements  handling epidemics due masks since then, boot, even though consistently questioned thing (since SARS least sure), data never strong enough knock health orgs recommendations.

We 100 years data vs 6 months social media campaign. Wear mask, means (I do!), really hope people treat like mask useless everything else possible top wearing one.  hey matters days, especially social media, look good regardless major fuckup not. Results matter. Czechia great evidence masks. addition masks, also stricter quarantines, first close borders, etc, compared European countries similar stages epidemic, better (and still better) cases. Comparing Eastern Northern European countries could act hundred cases, Czechia makes look like mandatory masks anything preventing cases. Masks preventing deaths cases remotely plausible even there, Czechia different (although somewhat lower death rate). mean, keep automatic weapons gun range, I'll keep universal healthcare everyone able receive care treatment regardless employment status, income, residency status. guess people keep dying able afford lifesaving medications surgeries - what's important fire ridiculous guns fun! Everyone well aware protests going likely negative effects pandemic response. can't wait longer. RI state troopers turned back cars NY, NJ, CT license plates state border Gov.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* PLZ work !  Every single night almost month now, large groups people breaking every quarantine rule books cities nationwide go ""protest"" cops bastards law enforcement fundamentally prejudiced evil etc... yeah great point - doubt people respect law, clearly respect law law enforcement all-time high right country. Duhhh. Looking Reddit ❄️ Oh god remember lmao great comparisons, though. 

There dozens separate cold viruses - one thing. measles high reproductive value need something crazy like 95% population immune time herd immunity. Strawman argument, friend - nobody made hand washing mandatory. 

As RTC studies, examples:

[Jacobs, J. L. et (2009) health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches. Face mask use HCW demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds.”*

[Cowling, B. et (2010) studies reviewed showed benefit wearing mask, either HCW community members households (H).”*

[bin-Reza et meta analysis 17 eligible studies. … None studies established conclusive relationship mask ⁄ respirator use protection influenza infection.”*

[Smith, J.D. et (2016) undertook meta analysis available studies face masks. identified 6 clinical studies … meta-analysis clinical studies, found significant difference N95 respirators surgical masks associated risk (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”*

[Radonovich, L.J. et (2019) undertook study healthcare workers assess relative effectiveness face masks 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed study accounted 5180 HCW-seasons. … Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks worn participants trial resulted significant difference incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza.”*

[Long, Y. et al. six randomised clinical trials (RCT’s) face masks ascertain protected either wearer others around viral respiratory illness. total six RCTs involving 9171 participants included. statistically significant differences preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection influenza-like illness using N95 respirators surgical masks….The 4 use N95 respirators compared surgical masks associated lower risk laboratory-confirmed influenza.”*

Face masks work well surgeons want avoid dribbling sneezing patients, useless comes stopping viral infections. terms preventing spread COVID 19 evidence achieve anything all.

As far anyone knows viruses spread tiny [long residence time aerosol particles](http://ocla.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rancourt-Masks-dont-work-review-science-re-COVID19-policy.pdf). virions – spiky ball familiar – much, much, smaller weave fabric, even N95 clinical face masks. Thinking mask stop particles like throwing sand chain wire fence expecting fence stop sand passing it.

If hope protect viral respiratory infection, covering face face mask useful concrete lifebuoy.

There RCT studies anywhere analysis show protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections. ***This aren’t any.***

Though want wear mask, means, so.   think messed basic calculation proper description they’re measuring.

No treatment severe cases leads 22% mortality rate, whereas severe cases treated drug 17% mortality rate. 

So that’s (5/22)% 22.72% decrease mortality. decide want take away 1 (or 100%) get 87% figure. native Rhode Islander pains say always finds way lead nation. They'll backtrack call talkingPointsMemo ""fake news"". “Gut feeling” lmaoo can't even. Florida enters chat. “Hold beer.” feel far effectiveness goes, would probably starting finding pretty soon work..... won’t.  Houston, many problems! current travel restrictions Oh, would consider might validity Swedish strategy, then? Otherwise, stand uncorrected. wish best luck...

Let tell you, sad experience, treat ENTIRE BUILDING little bastards, able exterminate them. apartment building unwilling this. put belongings van, pump Vikane gas 24 hours, flee middle night new apartment, hope escaping them. even threw away shoes. come HARD MERCY, endemic infestation never escape. Whatever ""top tier"" friend offers, one seems like overkill, is? that. heard heat treatment effective single-family homes. 24 hours enforced high temperature sealed house. Everything would melt treatment needs placed air-tight sealed packaging stored somewhere untouched 18 months. MESS AROUND, little friends enjoying helping blood forever. Good luck. Dan Patrick said willing die airborne virus. I'm sure virus would happy travel balls get handled much virus absolutely discriminate. Young people close 0 risk virus, concern may spread to. care heard 25 year old died despite perfectly healthy (shown like 400 pounds pictures), give literally evidence suggests .01% fatality rate young people. I'm Monroe County, May 31 nearly 200 hospitalizations, 103 yesterday. Maybe stated “reasonable” confidence. Time would factor many particular situation. normal anyone pneumonia. People leave hospital “fixed” still might need supplemental oxygen home bit feel really short breathe you’re moving goal post. matter what, creating false fear never good. Damn, completely forgot him. Fauci admired due mask shortage Adams least needs address said done. Locally speaking newspaper articles, mid-March second/third week May....crime took huge nosedive. Even local prison populations reduced close 80%. 

Then week of/right Memorial Day, crime shot everywhere. Headlines murdered folk, thefts, DUIs, etc. things wide open locally week, explained upshot. like people waiting wings commit crimes. Sad article said jury trials moment would happening....at earliest...in February 2021. People symptoms recur. It’s recognized. would ideal. idea behind three day rule maximum time know [virus live everyone quarantines mask three days, one could inadvertently catch virus mask's surface.

However, mask better mask, likely (in opinion) virus would survive real world masks three full days. have, say, two masks, try alternate days, make sure careful washing sanitizing hands touching mask case. quarter country completely meanwhile I’ve read lot shame status lost taking care people Europe, big deal context took oath protect Americans. Guess meant nothing. Again, conflating ""enforce"" ""catch."" I've explained enforcement pretty comprehensively.

As far ""catch,"" like law broken. observed violation law, investigated, arrested. think happen, look Hawaii example multiple people getting jail time violating quarantine -- including residents. 

Hawaii geographical oddity among states, nothing unique special criminal justice system. schools person classes right states limited occupancy indoors outdoors. Numbers still spiking like crazy. enough ti scar eem yeah cant trust nypd city agency Oh no, let feminists see this. Stay fuck inside vaccine.Models still predicted millions cases, coming. idea got downvoted, accurate. \*Stares EU numbers.\* I'm glad got virus.

He behaved like prick spreading misinformation beginning. look pictures tournament, organised, nobody cared. he'll personally feel serious thing is, hope fined forced pay medical expenses arise this. folks showing symptoms, reasonably assume sick. data issue comes fact many people showing symptoms virus. Obviously one 100% prove something lie. ""Lie"" likely explanation. require 100% proof intent lie, one would ever guilty lying, every liar claim ignorance right?

What want source? provide proof ""new evidence"" claimed changed opinion (asymptomatic spread) already known general public months announced it. Would suffice looking something else? Ah. Ok. Outside field expertise. I'd bet 1 developer work 4 there! (80.20 :) partly lot 80% symptoms? seems consistent we’ve seen date. strong deterrent dumb idiots. Like 10 year prison sentence assaulting without mask pandemic. kind nonsense would stop immediately should. sub, yeah probably telling everyone wear face masks, accusuing people murderers calling anyone questions anything fall line Covid-1984 narrative, 'a conspiracy theorist'. thousands roads connecting Pennsylvania New York. Many middle nowhere country roads, highways. also towns essentially exist sides border. Waverly, NY Sayre, PA technically two cities really one city exists states. going make sure people walk house PA two blocks NY? people live PA work NY? That's small number people. ton people live PA lower taxes actually work New York. 

And truck drivers? quarantine deliver load NY state? they're traveling need spend night truck stop NY? need go inside get food, use restroom, shower. little details one seems thinking about.

Authoritarianism perks many fatalities syndrome. careful.  Tell half dozen drug patents.  Deaths lag also treatment improved. feel like would repercussions yelp itself, least incentive businesses truthful. think customers would leave good reviews businesses blatantly lied safety precautions. study found biologics protective, autoimmune diseases (or predisone) Autoimmune diseases likely increase covid infection risk disease severity 2x - infections.

If biologics (I'm not) protected cytokine storms. Genuine question, go work?  Please focus anecdotes. ever time focus data, it. sub assumes much it’s taken fact think home considered essential Ha, funny. Orlando definitely BFE, excuse. think last weeks taught us anything randomly reporting others police may death sentence them.

They barely keep cops jobs now, adding scope help this. Dude serious? exactly problem.

FOHM reports 69 deaths span 3 weeks ago, ie possibly adding 68 deaths 3 weeks ago 1 today, arguing giving exact picture ? 🤷🏽‍♂️ Live west Texas. get really weird stares wearing mask. It’s really frustrating. We're still Zoom things- trivia night, board games, etc. door starting crack open little bit personal socialization.

I think know behave now. think majority ordinary people would agree seeing someone outside who's sick greater 6 feet distance relatively safe. think people, really would extend family. I've dipped toe this- Father's day, saw father empty park safe distance first time since February.

I'm certain lot people still averse kind meet up. also know people would judge careless (and maybe little bit selfish) open behavior (sharing food, maintaining distance, meeting indoors). also family would hurry see struggle maintain distance (younger children).

Overlapping fact virus widespread areas others. us make smart choices, lived isolated town essentially zero cases, might behave differently. idea behind three days maximum amount time virus known live surfaces Since people wearing hodge podge various mask materials, difficult give specific guidance, max used safe. personal opinion, likely masks safe re-wear sooner three days-- however, feel good guidance give general, especially may true one person's mask another person's, various conditions could drastically affect long takes virus die. Translation: ""I'm tired Trump's bullshit."" Iceland method sounds way better. Bring negative test take one airport get day. US constitution denies states right close borders. trade horrible winters horrible summers. worth it. Sure, there’s also 60% us following CDC guidelines nationally (even Fox News polls seem suggest majority polled seem approve wearing face coverings) closer 90% NYC, us falling dumb marketing stunts. actually reading wrote? one demographic matches influenza rates COVID that's 17-and-unders. 

The overall death rate COVID generally exceeds influenza demographics. think that's true extent. cases going way up, testing centers Houston area running daily test capacity. shortage tests really hard hit ares, test reserved people likely sick. 

The two 'mega site' Butler Delmar Stadium Houston reaching daily test capacity noon. Leading world tests per confirmed case. Pretty impressive.  Presumably infection severity still significantly increased (4x). hospitalization reduced - probably due cytokine storm prevention. described schools. worried August ... state, specifically city people respecting pandemic.

Celiac Hashimotos, autoimmune diseases. take steroids either those. sure whether study would actually apply me. hope not, anyway. Wait, need three different masks? switch every time wear it? (To comply three day part) states reopened good trend? I'm NY still mostly closed seems numbers declining anymore, ideal news. think masks band aid allow safe reopening, California certainly good trend even mandaing them. seems reopening impossible without medical breakthrough. Yeah it’s sad. guess I’m naive never realized public health issue could possibly become political like this. already effect nothing essential racetrack Bum fuck Egypt Imagine sent everyone $5 box masks along stimulus check. Nah cuomo sucks fhm add retroactively. number sum 69 add retroactive revisions day. 3 day quarantine would obviously reduced effectiveness compared

The median incubation period 5.9 days. Assuming fall median incubation period, become infectious course day 3. 3 day quarantine would ensure someone infected would likely released quarantine right start spreading virus. quarantine period shorter median incubation period would cause harm good. Seriously, like hardly anyone died there. emulate everything did. Great response, really great see someone lives Spain. even stricter lockdown Italy, almost total compliance, mask-wearing 90% even voluntarily. Damn, wish Merica would take notice. allowed leave state summer unless job requires it. Thank god man Delaware stopping fining state drivers. heavily misinformed. declared Public Health Emergency International Concern - highest alert level - January. 

They called public enemy #1 mid-Februari. world witnessed China trying stop spread January.

Pima County, majority new cases people 20-44, slight uptick number new cases 65+, nearly dramatic. might account that. church holding rally claims air unit eliminates 99% coronavirus. However, emergency room doctor, Murtaza Akhter, working COVID-19 patients since start pandemic, said filtration system work people close other.

""The thing rallies, example, people really close even filtration system, person coughs person, person clearly going get sick; there’s way particle whatever call filtered,” Dr. Akhter said. wait, liberal hoax? that's everybody TN saying. Regardless majority people trying tell you, masks likely wearing going keep getting covid, it’s going keep germs closer face don’t spread others. yes , reuse mask prevent spread covid you. actually want prevent covid others , need n95 mask higher reusable. Yeah worries they’re (citizens) gonna care/listen health advisement/warnings even though really good. live NYC + seen lot bad stuff occurring result COVID bc work healthcare, try warn family lives Orlando people still won’t take precautions despite warnings 😢 idea going happen, yet seem hoping things go seriously wrong UK. really desperate hypothetical opinions made real? came Korea NJ, I'd think one strictest quarantine enforcement world, would violation people's rights America. Even people still break quarantine take phone use credit card. way NJ enforce shit eyes, government another business quarterly gains, long-term damned. figure time company goes bankrupt they'll comfortably sailing away golden parachute. Idaho same. 200 new cases reported today, less 2 million population. same! Belichick always respect football geniuses, lost respect people seeing p0litical positions. They're bad rest the... uh... let's say execrable supp0rters current administration. Trump: ember. That's reasonable measures every country take Yup..
It would seem make exception bring smartphone visit. That's downside unprecedented requirements. gonna completely straightforward everybody.

The contact tracing app question saves data device though last 14 days sent authorities sent request data consented it. data deleted afterwards. person ran account loss family iirc took time off. Opening overcrowded schools almost ventilation time cold flu season sounds like great plan. Yes? TF STILL VISITING PLACES Pretty sure keep RNC convention JAX track. It’s thing makes sense me. Nah, I'm sarcastic jerk.

I get deserve. :D summer lull. 500-1000 deaths day sounds bad realize topped 4k day peak state alone 460 dead one day.

the lull dead stop, due contagious covid is. simply lowers baseline transmission rate gets multiplied human actions intervention. 

Thing is, already past solstice. days already getting shorter. less month average Temps start dropping too. lull til late August weather starts favoring virus considerably again. could long fall winter, starting virus place right get go. oh God, thread saying stupid things. Stop. Come Amsterdam. Everybody speaks english things back normal besides restrictions.  order coronavirus diet coke. dont grow food protect CV. going grocery everywhere else 3 months fact havent gotten isnt luck. nba fan obviously news result want see. staff (cameras, officials, 2 teams) games would 100+ people stadiums one time, could potentially super spreader event. 
For health safety everyone involved sadly worth it. 123,000 dead March, 8.7 million figure from. Oh OK, c0vidiots isn’t allowed freedumbs is. Thanks lot useless bot I'm talking economic sanctions. Agreed. Still means long way herd immunity unfortunately. EU telling truth US corona situation Trump tries hide.  great excuse give. I'm sure going hard go back office this. Theres probably cant wait get back tho. I've q stay home mom 15 years, dont even know could handle 9 5 lol would Brexit Britain do? BREAKING NEWS- California Arizona finally considered part South, bringing end centuries arbitrary geography. Feels like something would say stock market collapse Please stay safe people Texas. Everyone really, especially trapped states getting hammered right now. pivotal moment feel powerless help watch Northeast hoping y’all stay safe curb thing anyone attending bars simply mins boggling big generalization? also anti-lockdown protests Europe. country blindsided ample time prepare, failing ample time look countries China Italy contain pandemic.

This lack leadership root cause. know there's TONS stupid people enforcement coherent reslonse would go long way.

Instead Elon fucking Musk deliberately disobeying orders look happened.

Any country would charged given 20 year sentence. Deaths counted COVID attending physician medical examiner, best judgment, thinks probably caused COVID. test. Obviously standardization, there's unlikely great number direct COVID deaths recorded way. Now, indirect ones different story. estimate definitely 8-9% march. hardly anywhere close New York, NJ, New England area, governors shut down, preach people wear mask.

In South here, governors opposite ""have open save economy"".  NOBODY wears mask. buy bullshit people wearing South. Plus 0.0% social distancing kind. 

Weather zero differences. believe know hospitalization rate.

That requires knowing total case count, know number. Asymptomatic cases exist, estimates tell could account 50% cases.. makes 5-8% overestimate, unknown factor.

Even watered numbers watered learn truth. point, people can't pass good panic! Antibodies made infection. Makes sense they'd drop. fucking shit Sherlock ""Classic American."" That's sentence, sorry bud. guys aren’t taking pandemic seriously? study people idiots? Ahh metric...the last 24 hrs. tell stated incorrect? seen answer question thought may know answer. someone goes elective procedure tests positive admitted hospital surgery delay procedure? would think would delay patient tests negative surgeons want extra complication dealing potential complications infection know.  Freedom=living.

If dont freedom sheep sucking government off. Than*

FTFY.

Classic American, can't spell ther language. causation

Gross armchair expert. Reddit full them.

Yeah dude, medical researches Cambridge University Virginina Commonwealth University well aware. studies adjust that. Believe know this. solid evidence either way.

Yes is, recent evidence getting clearer clearer. says instead:

I read entire article and:

1. written early June considered two recent major, credible studies since published. says data yet know effective masks general public. 

2. says health care professionals recommended wear masks. 

3. says influenza every coronavirus masks effective stopping transmission. 

4. reason skeptical recommend general public make usage because:

A) social distancing important 
B) mask make people think they're invincible 
C) lead mask shortages health workers. 

None three conclusions odds statement masks effective preventing transmission. covid 19 hit us 2020? Top eleven new cases today : Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina, California, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi

Sec football states: SEC consists 14 member institutions located U.S. states Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas.

Eight match ok never mind. Failure understanding ze joke end

And ya. great job NYC failure aiming for. even hurts people? Nice see moral standard. Texas morgues next institutions hit capacity. prime minister one speculating, smart ass. Fingers crossed open time soon. cant type right something, government railing right accidentally keep hitting caps lock button, blink need help. send help.

If rights. take long find restaurants stores taking pandemic seriously vs ones arent.  

I new go (small) grocery store system makes feel comfortable going there. allow 5 patrons time, masks required, cashiers behind plastic dividers, one way entrance one way exit dont pass people way out, theres hand sanitizer near exit door. guy entrance door enforcing mask capacity rules, wiping carts lysol next person enters. perfect.

They business life implementing policy last 3 months.  big grocery stores 50/50 mask use terrifying.  use walmart curbside pickup while, wont stepping inside normal walmart basically zero community spread area...and feeling that's gonna year two. amount people follow rules, still beneficial. need 100% compliance effect. statistical models used measure effect introducing rules factor percentage non-compliance Okeydoke Restricting travel US isn’t standing US, it’s common sense move Americans would agree with. test work ambition deal roommate go home.. I'm currently sitting woods 🤣 Dallas here. correct, bars 110% capacity first day reopening back early May. apparently give painful sunburnt butt hole. careful folks, bc Gwyneth Paltrow put GOOP make safe effective.  much appreciate skepticism honest investigation. even numbers correct, error would scale 3%, difference European CDC data FHM data scale 20%, really matter purpose post. thank fact checking me. worry!! guys like 100K ICU beds. Texas highest number occupied beds! proud /s mean ex coworker. 
Give two weeks pinebox. wouldnt surprise members administration went behind Fauci's back carry Trump's orders slow testing. happened Ukraine, Trump's close allies end-run around ambassador *officially* charge. sounds absurd, is.

If accept infections 80 times higher stated, explosion new confirmed cases testing would significantly higher virtually every test positive. 

This happening. testing showing approx 5-10% positive cannot 80x infection load previously thought. fundamental there.

Edit add sewage testing could play role confirming hypothesis correct. testing probability done areas would much visible news cycle someone's paper it. mUh fReEdUmBs! change fact Texas living best life resulted soft lockdown month later world gone way top length lockdown. It’s driven social media echo chamber fear. 

Actually, driven science sound medical advice. also working places people actually put effort. countries improving spread control already, reopening responsibly, sports resuming, people back work, etc. 

I'm sure seem think locking letting virus spread like wildfire ideal solution pandemic. It’s probably driven social media echo chamber ignorance misinformation he's probably looking forward voter suppression pandemic cause November. Guns=freedom.

Have fun trying invade US, lose. Everyone gun. dumbest, slowest, oldest always die first true wilderness exception accidents course. Rural America isnt wild either. Humans apex predators things America particular pose threat human. (Moose, mountain lions, grizzly/polar bears) part far north western mountains. wont include insects I'd consider unavoidable accident happened upon hive killer bees something.

There 9 different kind intelligence, one naturalist includes survival skills. plan laid out, would assumed naturalist intelligence would fact help others may it, would average least 3. solo? Without naturalist might able get away one others survive. reality everyone varying amount intelligence chances going close average all



Edit/tldr

What may consider stupid, could fact prodigy another type intelligence. That's reasonable. Seems like 10x undercount floor based info like serology findings. talking new cases last 24 hours. know, metric matters deciding whether theme parks open not. Go read Harrison Bergeron get back :D wonder also less infections. percent people die infections they've contracted hospitals. people going hospitals afraid COVID, get infections either. mUh riGhTzZz! 100%, read social media really kind replaced ""town square"" terms people talk things think beneficial, also really highlights important critical thought understanding quality source really matters. 

Additionally agree information. One pet peeves reading articles journalist write scientific studies. tendency overly simplistic, I'm sure 20% scientific literacy rate country, many details particularly around context scope get left Everywhere this.
2020 canceled folks, stay home. feel like went ""we gotta make example states opening fast"" part state entering phase 4 end week.

Like, what's 180? went store yesterday employees wearing masks report them.

We ready phase 2 ffs. one gives shit rules town. Stop opening fast. false. world put mountains research HIV malaria done decades. 9 pregnant woman can't make baby 1 month. vaccine could theoretically even available considerable amount Christmas Oxford animal studies have.

A vast majority promising vaccines make trials fail. unlikely work. enough, 1 gun per household like US. say so. Getting one legally costs tens thousands dollars FBI figuratively probes insides. Getting one illegally much less paperwork. Wtf I'm terrified they'll open border soon, insane surge cases do. coming someone Ontario. Hopefully keep extending open date. able get loans need pay back interest. Right they're buying members congress bucks getting huge grants cash. Mainly people like jump source follows want. Yes trump sucks Trump would definitely this, make sure real. 

We really avoiding fall pitfalls fake news Didn’t lose mind RI this? horseshit notion ever national handle coming from? dont rights, government already tied weird BDSM move, sorry americans actually live. mUh gUnz!

Reeeeeee number dead compared cases, opened closed, trying get measurement deadly disease is.

That show 1 10 chance dying.

For example, remaining 3.7 million people pull through, 9% number would go drastically. part LA, avoid it? neighborhood everyone extremely diligent masks far. Fingers crossed stays way. said source cited article - cited. testing ending.

Sorry understand trying say. mean month old research based ten patients duplicated?

You really holding running around telling people know talking about...

Just, wow even mean!?!? I’m actually really curious. viruses developed natural herd immunity to? Michigan overwhelmed hospitals high death. goal? What? many people sub rationale category. It’s either one extreme other. sub doesn’t like anyone middle ground. Personally understand covid threat vulnerable , can’t lock millions people economy think consequences / aftermath it’s something we’ve never done short term, yes, it‘s always quicker effective (from political viewpoint) authoritarian system. 

But long term cause issues favoritism forms corruption, whilst also stifles initiative since everyone always form responsible someone.

This Romans deliberately created one man magistracy responsibility someone could head state times disaster, though limited time only. bunch star players start getting COVID 19, then? going see teams third string quarterbacks starting, third string recievers? say get sick also? like bunch different groups rising exponentially. trend what's scary. Fauci lied thousands died time, especially Florida Arizona. Oh, nobody come here. 

and worse US economy Europe opening us. Air travel aside, American tourism Europe financial transfer US them. international tourism US imports foreign dollars US soil, that's going dead water too.

Which reopening without precautions ""save economy"" shit. pandemic puts downward pressure consumer interest, fastest path actual positive economic activity must necessarily include dealing virus honestly earnestly.  Surprising hear, given mass achoo-ing that's going day-in day-out state.  RIP, upvoted 🤣 Absolutely. Masks 'may well' kind thing. benefit likely minor best, cost virtually non-existent.  counting asymptomatic cases global problem includes US. available evidence strongly suggests US absolutely horrible response pandemic.

A metric harder get wrong total deaths. issue deaths misclassified least asymptomatic deaths. metric US still worse anyone else also includes countries 4x population.

I know epidemiologists pushing use excess mortality rate metric found charts based that.

If evidence contrary I'd love see everything I've seen paints clear picture US totally flubbing COVID-19 response. Lol. words; yes. Looks like we’ve finally reached point New York Northeast’s falling cases longer skew data looks like US whole experiencing thing. Yea transplant - state employee - always seems fight better outcomes states. It’s hard explain can’t really figure happens, could emphasis education - also get sense that, even dumbest corners state, there’s sense civic mindedness that’s hard overcome, even unspoken. particular case COVID, think bad start one wants go again. Americans proved incredibly delicate really are

leave 800 rolls Charmin Sensitive this. interesting.. Grønland København too?

(apart big-ass island mean) :p really scary seen happen, like NYC eastern NJ. hospitals got overwhelmed patients able shuffled hospitals compensate, close disaster. One hospital fills, nearest ones start getting patients fill faster. starts horrible domino effect eventually can't keep with. Looks like Europe needs Freedom.


Edit: honesty, feel we'll watch Trump wreck what's left trade economy trying strong arm Europe. Fresh panic talking point! might start offering user pays self quarantine service! Yeah, heard college football players getting also. Might well put 2021 2022. What's point testing?

Like negative, I'm told social distance quarantine.

If positive, I'm told social distance quarantine.

Even really negative, exposed covid 5 minutes later local grocery store.

Is something I'm missing here. people tax payers well. What's point paying taxes benefit social services? get upset people insurance provider make claims don't? 

And fact make unemployment seen unemployment generous. see Disney underpaying employees. Active cases relevant combination tracability cases general risk. example parts US currently high rates positive tests compared total number tests, indicates high number cases found perfect system filtering people tested. Please decide likely. first two real problem allowing travel needs weight benefits opening up. still  reopened everything around 30 cases per day. thought travel bans work? Yeah, live Sacramento get snarky replies mask wearing

I dont wear me, wear courtesy others well. Well, given commander chief uttered words almost exactly serious it, never know. family members parrot everything says like gospel. said it, /s would implied (or explicitly stated). dad said it, would 100% serious. seriously fucked move almost certainly led thousands unnecessary deaths.

If needed lie, could said ""cloth masks actually effective N95s"". could banned sale medical grade masks non-medical customers. man. Best luck! went dentist last week. Honestly felt pretty badly hygienist. wearing PPE including two masks face shield. enormous air filter machine next me. took temperature asked standard questions exposure travel. gave safety glasses wear rinse twice solution peroxide listerine. felt protected much aerosolization (if that’s even word) patients stressful providers. mention happens bunch star players get COVID 19 time? play teams pratice squad players, people signed street? That’d fuckin great. long it’s safe, sign up. Well 98% live assuming hospitals still providing good excellent medical care. know what's mortality like untreated? sick hospitals full find out. ""Random blogger"" count expert. result enormous unnecessary loss life? Ok, sure. one's denying that. mean there's blood Cuomo's hands? mean physically, answer no. people don’t follow problematic people anyways. 

The people follow already making good decisions.  LOL, hope so. Right, people think that. Some, far all, enough, people think themselves. virus survive surfaces much easily then.

And air too, likely. Yes - community get hit cold virus one year cold virus B next year (or month, whatever - that's oversimplification general idea). think stops circulating within community point? 26 trillion divided 330 million Americans $78,000 . family four it’s going $315,000.
Please use cashiers check pay, personal checks.
Did mention half worlds population lives less $5.50 day respiratory symptoms :/

Why go say shortness breath cough? Getting tested super important. Good luck! Nice! I’m glad able take care business keep afloat.

As said, know people know, experiences, really relate that. get eventually! Stay safe friend! Suuuure. Americans children comes inconvenience. OP trip planned US august, mean live countries listed restrictions? Texas enforcing quarantines visitors hard-hit states while. Based comments saw Reddit, really would send state police officers confirm home (you weren’t allowed leave reason, except depart state seek medical attention).

One comment said officer asked person look window say cars front. Another called morning said he’d arriving 30 minutes verify compliance. What? business find positive employee - would send staff get tested. Otherwise spread. Aside: awesome post! Thank you. True. sensible people without guns. (I know you) Texas - friendship state. never stops giving. could literally commit murder national TV people still vote him. Never underestimate stupid. think one biggest mistakes made. said talked mask alternatives (i.e. making cloth masks).

They going hard time living down.  sure. read something similar somewhere think could anywhere 2-5 months. even studies, don’t even timeframe figure out. Nothing’s illegal don’t enforce law. feel like comment username. 98% chance it. 99% Americans diagnosed it. Take deep breath, odds call coming slim. Remember times pre covid symptoms Good. Keep nasty conservative state “mAsKs iNfRiNgE rIGHts!!” germs here.  one reporting results arrive rhe reporting results day tested? earth would possibly enforce that? Lol ridiculous. dont need ""travel papers"" us...for fucks sake. Article says 28 percent increases cases due churches, people traveling Myrtle Beach. Thailand basically locking land. Better make sure pack food luggage quarantine. Props NM COVID-responsible! &lt;3 Blackboard Monitor Vimes. 

I hope one day children read ""Where cow?"" (With right noises course!) Next step ban US athletes Olympics next year if/when fail get control. im sure lost someone due misinformation take comfort words... piece shit There’s nothing do. virus isn’t going disappear always there. adjust fatality rate age think find almost negligible risk 40. We're probably talking ""struck lightning dying risk"" 18. strategy protect vulnerable instead broad, economy-wide lockdown.  Yeah - Irish version quarantine - fill form arrive says agree self isolate arrive here.

And give contact number ring give call ask this. rarely call. do, say 'yes' that's that. 

Then, leave airport take taxi / bus / hire car go wherever fuck want country without hassle all. 113 hospitals entire state 9 million peole. Til chronic fatigue Long Beach? live Long Beach everywhere go see people masks. people might affect later?  Speak yourselves. Nobody paying attention mask wearing ordinances one enforcing them, much like lot things. you’re somehow managing get 3 day bans continual name-calling. 

Amazing. 14 days earlier.

[you’re lovely ""I kid."" - Trump. June 23rd. responsible sacked. Sadly think correct. understand reasoning, can't help thinking could've executed better.  ...how less complex? Yes. 

You doctor (presumably, asking question), therefore judge someone needs ventilation, much less properly. 

Going hospital real option come that. Well, documented cases measles 1700s, still don’t herd immunity that. 

Or common cold viruses. still get them. herd immunity develop without vaccination?

It doesn't. specific circumstances get temporary herd immunity without vaccination small sub-populations, inevitably immunity wanes/people born. takes effort maintain, without vaccine means new infections. 

Which endemic disease. eventually, would likely take good number years that. 

The huge problem COVID-19 people mild apparently even symptoms spread it. SARS example apparently nearly entirely spread obviously symptomatic people way easier quarintine them. got tested day got exposed, almost certainly get negative result regardless whether got infected. (False negative rate = 100%). ideal day get tested 3 days symptom onset. 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" I've seen many people say ""Just protect old people vulnerable"". even protect lockdown, hell control outbreak? Ahh yes least 500 per Million dead FLA, hidden

But new York report numbers

🙄 live SW Florida, big time MAGA country every bit awesome sounds. I'm glad went 15 zero gone Easter. Hardly anyone wearing mask here. Bars restaurants crowded. time alive...for now! issue authoritarian emergency situation ability poor decision making. don’t anyone debate even check decisions, dictators easily screw exacerbate issue. grift. I'm willing bet component they'll get supplies 3 month old ""medical supply wholesalers"" raided stockpiles incoming shipments Trump's happy help.   state I've noticed neighborly outside gatherings. 2-5 people sitting outside chit-chatting. think kinda cool really. hypothesis back virus circulating California early November last year state may already reached kind herd immunity, explained New York getting hammered California relatively quiet back March/April. 

I guess proving false. License plates wouldn’t really work. lot people updated tags moving (don’t blame them-insurance lot cheaper elsewhere). 

In addition, rental cars. Even local renting car might plates another state. 

I came NY summer (I stay LI every summer, I’m Atlanta). got tested drove up. 

I feel like testing really best way this. Require testing travelers. no. wear mask. case. symptoms told “we don’t many tests ones we’re saving returning college students spring break”.  love logic. It’s logical tbh law enabled enforce curfew protests?

Cause one.  One thing H1B reform comes nothing close that, eliminates legal means immigrating work. actually really lazy part (not surprising). Real immigration reform takes time hard work, say high skilled visas anyone. You’re right, I’m giving up.

Thank post, it’s given lot think about. No. nothing do. need ventilator don’t get one you’ll probably die. know sounds awful that’s truth. People ventilators monitored closely specially trained staff. much low percentage due measures taken reduce spread highly populated areas? much due natural social distancing occurs less densely populated areas? much low percentage due underreporting? think Hawaii eventually this.

The National Labs big presence islands, also in-house testing capability employees. Hawaii said even test less 24-hours prior negative, would hotel work site, still waive 14-day quarantine. expect change soon though. nurse working covid unit. completely maxed beds floor ICU. Last night, patient crashed couldn’t even take ICU bed full. even vapotherms, device help respiratory failure. can’t intubate ventilate regular floor lost. wasn’t even time pt ended coding passing away. tried hard get back. patient wasn’t given chance live capacity at. that, imagine tell spouse, patient hall, loved one died. married 42 years. one hundred chaotic things occurred past days. many others much ptsd mental physical fatigue past months. Please help us part. I’m fucking almost like comedy Hollywood film there, even funny. someone misfortune follow tales r/coronavirus awhile, pretty sure personally earned every downvote.

I watched patronizing attempts endearing ""locals"" like:

[""Good 

What rediculous statement.

Like American watched Thor: Ragnarök thought expert Fennoscandinavia. Wow. cancel festivals/large gathering events back spring? PA cancelled postponed ahead time autumn even next year. got pulled running stop sign (I didn't). friend got moving violation ... car parked. 1st week college every year, cops would give tons &lt;10 mph tickets towners would simply pay them. upsides downsides police. conspiracy theory. It'd less believable kind power abused. New Zealand would like word. Also Nova Scotia, Canada. university recently sent email referencing we're going go back classes fall said air conditioning meets ""current recommended air changes per hour,"" meant air ""properly cleaned safe."" wonder recommendations refers whether standards general standards actually safety virus. also say, ""It also important note reports air distribution systems spreading COVID-19 infectious diseases flu.""

... think sounds right reading articles spreading air conditioning. think even bigger financial crisis 2008 coming up. 

There massive defaults US, country seems unable contain virus, spreading havoc amongst people economy alike, leading even unemployment. Next thing financial crisis I'm sure time countries pump unlimited money markets, again. causing limitation movement saying quarantine entry. different saying respect state laws. fucking breakthrough.

**The faster country implemented preventative measures, deaths prevented!!**

*Surprised Pikachu face* fair, see large number people grasping whole ""mask"" concept all. #HAHAHAHAHA YES! LOVE AUTHORITARIAN DICTATORSHIPS!!!

The China boner people fucking ridiculous. second time today someone posted something herd immunity beginning levels low 25%. know what's happening first time I've heard anyone start saying that, heard twice today.

So everybody watch this, looks like up-and-coming talking point misinformation regarding herd immunity. Misunderstanding herd immunity lead people's behavior changing deaths, recommend people call misinformation much possible. 

This virus continues transmit ""herd immunity"" happens 70% *but prevent transmission disease.* slows down. one else ""news"" site reporting this. Fake News. Geez, that’s terrible. I’ve seen many people rise top incompetence. one manager promoted could get position. must dirt refused fire him. Hopefully many others work complaining higher ups notice pattern. time consideration long since passed. Nut shut up. sub praises social distancing treatments medicine smh thing like masks. Even get 100% compliance it'll still drive numbers down. Source? Isn’t virus cousin sars mers? odds eventually goes away like did? true Arizona increasing testing, percentage tests coming back positive also increasing, currently 20% according , way high- that's US seeing back March. percentage high, means disease spreading faster ability keep testing.

There people get multiple tests, numbers small, Ontario, also counting number tests (not number people tested) percentage positives dropped 0.43% increasing test capacity too. Arizona looking good even compared southern US states. reliable source? says exclusive story, cite source revealing move feds, can't find source corroborate it. I'm unfamiliar source website, Talking points Memo, reliability. US airlines going serious financial trouble years come. countries get Covid control, they're going quarantine USA. named dictator life murdered everyone openly disagreed doesn’t really count willing giving power. getting murdered everyone secretly disagreed sort proves that. Staying closed year option.

Staying closed year option *politically*. could done fine, supporting market bailouts related grand malfeasance, take granted. UK, much, much poorer country, locked relatively layoffs: government actually subsidizing people's salaries, rather handing thousand dollars bit extra unemployment. think that's accurate. think get herd immunity bacterial infection. fair, thought that, optimism comes still needing research antibodies (some reseachers critique studies' design, specificity/sensitivity testing Covid-19 antibody seems place).

If turns immunity consistently lost 3-5 months. That's downright awful. Antigens? think walk fine line scientist catering politicians really charge. never liked him. hear stories thinks he's cool every player locker room, terrible on-court temperament lot career, seem like ""good guy"" now, never came across genuine guys like Federer Nadal. He's absolutely godly tennis player though. Jesus Christ, Open Bars freaken hot zones point. someone State Connecticut who's dealing thousands rude ass New Yorkers ""fled virus"" FUCK CUOMO. Connecticut same. counties upstate NY less medical infrastructure older populations shut hotels airbnbs prevent spread.  Ultimately, agree completely unenforceable. Yeah. Ya might wanna stay away friends weeks return. live Florida keys island chain isolated nature USA. opened road June 1st absolutely enforcement except locals themselves. amount cases doubling every day lack respect shown visitors atrocious. It’s really sad selfish delusional species. There's reason CDC federal agency. Disease give shit state lines. Umm, what’s essential driving hundreds miles circle get.....nowhere? Edit misread. Still seeing sources linked. Black Death bacterial. herd immunity there. It’s still deadly (15% so) handful hikers get every year Southwest.

We basically got lucky species rats live around changed centuries - used live near much friendlier little fuzzy disease vectors. invented antibiotics. local bar needs stay open worth living can't pay $6 shitty natty light poured glass eat fried pickles bunch assholes barely like. Ya. 

Bigger. Better. Faster. fucking American! 

Cough wind!!!!!!!! Crying ""we can't stay forever"", ""we need sort timeline"" favorite ""the governor tyrant giving us solid date.""

Hello fellow Michigander? lol high shoot! thought hit success recent ones. books

Which chapter book suggested housing COVID patients nursing homes? flu (I assume) even didn’t eat 4-5 days, coughed hard think ripped lung tissue muscles still kinda hurts months later, weird noise throat chest didn’t go away weeks, overall breathing fine feel little worse, like 5-10% bad days flu. shit definitely effect long term i’ve flu once. Can’t imagine what’d happen got twice underlining conditions. understand coming from, apologies meant go off-topic. point getting ultimately, **has** federal issue state infrastructure establish could considered """"boundary"" public health terms. 

The federal government billions dollars invested customs border patrol - entity exists create strict boundary people, materials, yes biological agents. Anyone ever passed ports entry knows strict keeping fresh fruits vegetables - snacking apple pass through, likely lose SENTRI pass 10 years probably spend whole day secondary screening get *huge* fine. done protect agriculture foreign biological pests. 

Between states meaningful boundary. given border states dozens even hundred different roads crossing border - mention vast areas land barriers cannot meaningfully monitored. Domestic flights pass customs sort screening. last resort states attempting quarantine certain out-of-state people based license plates questioning extremely difficult enforce.

From public health standpoint, borders basically exist. example California might lower overall positivity rate Arizona, state policies vastly different, communities sides Arizona/California border seeing almost exactly rate infections per capita. Missouri might vastly different policies Kansas, two adjoining parts Kansas City unlikely see much difference long interstate travel commerce largely unrestricted.

Some states better others state completely ""contain"" virus unless every state thing. likely happen. That's point leave decision states *major* mistake way effect comprehensive public health response pandemic ultimately works federal level. utterly failed that. fact disheartening. knows corruption beyond going may even privy to. I'm saying 5,000+ deaths. I'm merely saying numbers wrong they're wrong multiple reasons (deaths reported non-COVID were). 

To original point, however, comparing NYC....you're comparing apples oranges. Totally different ways go think feel confident saying 'everything a-okay.' Honestly think that's understand long-term long remains infectious need somebody going basic training infecting whole damn training pipeline. GASP GASP GASP........ THUD! Japan never experiencing much initial spike despite taking significant action. chances find major population level factors impact spread virus seems high point. rip US airlines going serious financial trouble years come. countries get Covid control, they're going quarantine USA. Jeff mean? New York longer hot spot, curve flattened. 552 new cases yesterday. Compare smaller states like Arizona, North Carolina, Florida thousands new cases yesterday. even though Trump insisted asked slow testing, Fauci Redfield say asked slow testing. ask? something works except doesn't, actually work.

This disease appears driven primarily asymptomatic carriers superspreaders. spreads quietly pervasively explodes superspreader contracts passes entire community. be- them. Putin builds super sanitation tunnel almost everyone around right appeared public looking like complete shit. completely support it. But, going it? customs anything like border protection New York State. couple options MA. day trip, work something else, forced quarantine. spending night, forced either quarantine 14 days, leave. Ya article also echoes last point: “It important note whilst seen reduction mortality ‘run-up’ seeing full extent SARS-CoV-2 may also negative future consequences. possible may see significant rebound mortality simply delayed rather avoided entirety. rebound affect seen, may coincide peak demand SARS-CoV-2 medical beds, creating even greater healthcare need."" Love hear political Masks, proactive testing, tracking quarantine since beginning. lot countries went shutdown dozens cases, shutting international travels, ones China. single reason/magic bullet countries better; better done many things right done early. Usually happens go along herd lol 'Democracy still worst form government, except others.\*'

\* - except pandemic. problem theory is, get it? already rich beautiful third wife could spent rest moldering life cheating golf games. hell could offer already have?

No. think spot sabotage United States (and tbh, we've done shit many countries, I'm sure deserve it), think trump brainless puppet addicted attention power mastermind. It’s monitoring people trying visit states experiencing spikes quarantining people warning would expected quarantine.

If spikes nearby states becomes difficult.

If spikes coming afield Florida, doubt people driving daily work there.

The warning would able stay hotel room might enough deter people states far away. That's accurate though...tons rental cars people may (work pays it, car shop, etc) plates totally different state one rented from. Also people live may plate state \#1 astonishingly easy almost certainly already place reasons. possible track pneumonia deaths Florida? death numbers always seemed low. already blown like NYC, hasn’t shown yet official numbers. That’s drives wall this. Gov. Abbot still doesn’t want change stance Read paper. describe method. data still valuable, despite dismissive ignorance. Obvious headline obvious.  Seems practical smart, really understand way. learn live virus rather cower cancel life year tackling issues way makes sense, safe, costs shared/passed onto consumer sustainable long need absolutely key. I'm smoking sure. Oh that's true. agree, think practical guidance. didn’t think meant it’s necessarily going worse worse. lined facts. 

But since mention - worrying amount new cases percentage positive tests gone down, although we’re testing broader part population.

I mentioned Danish stats way illustrating incredibly bad current Swedish stats look seen abroad - per test Sweden find 40 times cases Denmark. 
Saying increased testing blame high numbers doesn’t impress anybody else. One reasons jump went 80% hospitals reporting 91%. Still good numbers one reasons world would go full depression isolate US economically. much money every country tied US way. ironic, considering New Yorkers spread virus around country. could seen coming??? way. Italy one oldest populations Europe. Italians took mask wearing lockdown seriously. really begin effect international trade US business reps can't even get countries reps can't come here. exports already denied COVID fears. rest world open business us puts us big disadvantage trying reenter market. lot easier Hawaii tho fuck people visiting NY right anyways. huge shift previous tone, looks like knows Texas tipping point return. “Pooh-Pooh” Corona problem long bites hard ass Well that's kind shit book it? Maybe could turn Manhattan high security area one allowed enter leave. would even crazier needed rescue President high security area. would even that, Kurt Russell? tells absolute truth, runs risk fired. knows replacement would willing try tell truth. 

But, carefully tows line truth placating president, keep job keep country informed.

It's tricky line, positively insane administration puts position. like AIDS crisis, people died downplayed risks keep bosses happy. couldn’t catch everyone. Maybe people trains, buses planes, people driving. want avoid quarantine drive. It’s political dig. Cuomo refused shut state California did. 
 
California began basic lockdown procedures March 16th. New York began March 20th. faster thats beside's point. 
 
I'm saying Cuomo handled amazingly, things considered outside stupid dangerous retirement home's choices state handleded handling much better lot *cough* Florida *cough* states fair guy (which try online) automod aggressive, definitely led writing posts ambiguous true antibody tests would many positive results do. news talking minorities becoming infected higher rate false? I'm confused. authority CDC data now? world said factual concerning everything said? thin skinned people threads, swear. Delete away, PC bots. hell facts. Adblocked pretty article entirely bullshit. Yup, hypocrisy shouldn’t prevent attempting save lives. stop trying distract issue here, governor ordering lockdown telling people stay home Infection rates killed vulnerable people putting infected nursing homes. Literally headline still saying done outbreak? read article doctors saying thousands England permit lung damage

Did read fucking article? say that. Everything article qualified ""could"". one knows permanent effects yet sufficient time study. lot concern driven observable effects SARS MERS, we've decade longer study (and considerably virulent diseases). 

COULD thousands folks UK elsewhere end permanent lung scarring COVID-19? possible. catastrophic sounds, get permanent lung scarring serious respiratory infection. turn wheezing cripple. something prefer avoid, especially active person (most active people ""hospitalized severe COVID"" cohort concerning cases drawn from). 

It's kind hilarious chiding people ""not reading"" ""spreading narratives"" named ""thinkB4WeSpeak"" peddling nonsense based telephone game reading article apparently struggled understand. Recovered rate surpassed active cases india comparison give false narrative mainly due revised discharge policy . Though shd try know discharged patients needed hospitalized contact got infected days patient discharged. India population 1.3 bn tests per population always low possible india test everybody . china usa another developed countries . hope get normal vaccine till careful avoid infected Called it. corona party getting started Texas. Next time, listen experts. Read somewhere else rules would keep conscientious/respectful tourists like away open season asshats there. seems anecdotal confirmation theory. concerned live Acadia area. 

Hope able enjoy Maine safe so! do. coworker New York, Vegas, Florida since pandemic started, going back New York couple weeks.

Please quarantine them.. look FHM's data today 2 deaths today, look week likely roughly 15, 2-4 weeks could around 20-40, 23rd june.

That's true, ask you... use today's numbers calculation? get different (higher) results it.

**EDIT: using wrong population figure here. numbers valid.** State Emergency, Governor authority modify law sees fit. fact statement downvoted really shows makeup sub. Unfortunately, sub reddit directs order ""inform"" coronavirus.

Depressing stuff. Makes reconsider I'm reddit. federal gubmint needs get working stimulus measures, tell states stay open doesn’t mean will, states like Texas close without federal support economy going crash quickly time frame know vaccine lasting side effects? 6 months? Minneapolis seems fine. protestors wearing masks. big spike cases originally feared. Valid point. said, think right time travel. People acting like thing not. Well Florida, hows that? Mean Mode running inadequate stats personal intuition. 

Keep mind latest actual CDC statement root averages exactly this: 

**The onset duration viral shedding period infectiousness COVID-19 yet known**

We seem know 14 days greater weight occurrence even range limited 14 days. stats might yet discover 80% transmissions occur 15 days exposure one day after. 

Since asymptomatic undectable issue clouded. order infectious one going probably detectable. Day Three Q period would also testing day release would require negative test. 

14 days quarantine period travelers patently untenable (unless test positive). Anyone able cheat cheat etc.. unenforceable best result increased social unrest worst. also guarantee absence contact, reduced contact.  begs many concerns, pay provide secured housing food housekeeping internet services cost. - dumb.

A 3 day Quarantine, (possibly alongside duration stay limit protocols) would work. would tolerated. would dissuade people non-essential travel; heighten awareness personal responsibility and, still accommodate genuinely essential/priority travelers. would, noted keenly highlighted, mitigation - elimination - risk. reduction risk would significant enough consider it, opinion. 

Travelers tested 3 day expiry would thus tested *at least* 72 hours last probable infection contact. 

Everyone infected 14, 13 12 days (or more) day-of-travel would eliminated 14 days-to-contagious risk pool. 21% + reduction risk pool exposure host community.

Everyone would become infectious within 3 days exposed also detectable tested day three eliminated risk quarantine. Another reduction approaches 21% risk pool.

As note heightened risk would result infected at, susceptible median statistical scenario. importance understanding people become infectious made clearer.

But also, noted, comparing proposal quarantine option since full 14 day Q seems unlikely executable. case core remaining risk pool would cases mentioned. know much real risk pool includes see 3 day Q period filters early half time-based 14 day risk pool quarantine scenario let in. mental gymnastics: post Absolutely not, I'm arguing ""free"" health services. NHS deeply flawed. understand public health works? It’s inherently political... 1/10 many people USA, 2/3 population within 100km USA/Canada border makes whole border rather easy lock makes movement control easier, 10 provinces + 3 territories’ borders manage versus 48 contiguous states + 1 border USA. even 1% population infected yet so? Contract tracing showing spread happens multigenerational living one roof. Younger people getting giving older family members. 

In hot weather climates people going indoors spending time family members. could possibly work, fed already said intent helping states, loss sales tax, property tax, commodities tax millions unemployment sustainable. Especially seems clear end sight things could resume normal. Sure Yes would good idea keep New Yorkers away visitors. /s Yes, needed. Summer people summering always did. suspect we'll see major second wave spike matter weeks.

So, driving along Rt. 1 Ct. middle aged women flips probably me. Go fuck home. 

Under normal circumstances I'd welcoming can't atm. Never assume symptomatology many percentage people parents grandparents aunts uncles...basically anyone around kids, that's lot people. kids infected influenza almost every year despite getting shot. get mildly credit shot damn don't. ass must jealous things come mouth  March 13 homes admit individuals hospitals Covid present Lol wasn’t guy saying restricting movement New Yorkers states unconstitutional? believe threatened even sue Rhode Island. don’t know misinformation spread wearing masks make susceptible. believe rumour caused many people wear masks virus prime. need modern day Larry Kramer keep Fauci honest. Sir, transferring acute care bed. Would like Space Room Cowboy Room? Hitchhiking brother late moron. already doomed people. shame died yet. recent talks ruling emperor Xi must rubbed him. really possible US much fatter

  Asian country's population whole way, way less vulnerable  remember considering shutting Damn it. German wondering f*** russia got many infected yet death time. Hawaii that. course, easier quarantine visitors can't drive state. Masks required Los Angeles. work? Texan DFW ONE fucking takes shit seriously. 

The ratio masks mask like 

Masks 5% / masks 95% 


It fucking ridiculous I’d willing bet we’re gonna blow like New York well travel restrictions everything


It’s fucking stupid, why? info available this, doctors, data, people would rather listen politicians. Fuckin dolts Don’t come city. It’s risk others plus won’t get experience best parts nyc current situation. wait get ur money/time’s worth later? moved Phoenix couple weeks ago New Mexico. I’m blown away see despite multiple articles news reports Covid spikes Arizona lot people still even wearing masks still partying. I’ve heard many people say don’t believe virus, say it’s democratic hoax. It’s they’ll feel like “liberal” cautious wearing face masks stop going public gatherings. Sadly...yup. disordered logic. people saying Florida explode, they’ve saying since April. Oh keep waiting. Yeah it’s going happen. They’ll never even close level NY was. Specifically god awful decision force covid patients nursing homes. keep defending NY I’m sure age well 👌 Hong Kong’s plan form travel bubble Macau neighbouring Guangdong province mainland China stalled technical issues.  plan, [Hong Kong residents valid health stating free would exempt mandatory quarantine travelling province casino hub.A [month plan Hong Kong government increasing pressure speed process city gradually eases social-distancing measures revive economy.Speaking meeting advisers Executive Council Tuesday morning, Chief Executive [Carrie Lam Cheng said work done attempt facilitate travel amid quarantine requirements.  travel?

I’m happy emphasizes importance continuing ramp testing [it air isn't. thing ""a true airborne virus"" viruses wings- one airborne- carried aloft external force isn't. cut dry.

You retarded aren't. ""and we'll police pepper spray beat you"" Little less conversation, little action please.  Yep. soft lockdown. [Relevant Trump Reacher Gilt. Prove wrong. Australia too? month 2 weeks moms going work Pennsylvania applies workers might see per month. easy get officially diagnosed flu even it. people get flu even go doctor's taking wait see get better days approach. great hygienic would even better self isolate sick. adults living life catch spread it. Plus often contagious even start showing symptoms.

As pandemic nearly made public, workers interface public even get paid sick leave even somehow catch become contagious, still incentivised go work sick. Lots unable wear mask fear ""scaring customers"". Many adults proven go densely populated public space sick pandemic without mask ""tough"".

Besides, hurt get flu vaccine? time spend cars spent crashing lot car crashes fender benders deadly seat belts still good idea. inconveniences minor prevention high. would want let people country worst Coronavirus outbreak world? remember upset quarantine people state first touted. pandemic perspective, absolutely makes sense. Let's stop playing politics disease right thing. Obviously need take consideration logistics realistic seal entire borders, least general requirements self quarantine outsiders may reasonable start. Better wording: It’s like Caeser long term opposition. version bubble, people mad non-essential workers N95 masks lesser extent surgical masks upset home made masks, bandanas, etc... topic really. went Texas NJ April (family emergency) stayed quarantine location- Airbnb- 14 days required, contact others. Nobody called checked point- literally could running around town coughing people nobody cared check.

(Note: wasn’t sick exhibiting symptoms) Caesar didn’t kill everyone disagreed him, extremely pragmatic level headed despite dictator. specifically pardoned many enemies winning Roman civil war even put positions power newly formed government knew would need support new government appear legitimate.   can't really deny US response virus big factor debt high. spent second half march, April combination coughing shortness breath chest pain. Aside constant dread moment may check hospital never check out, three occasions thought might die. even went ER end April like half symptoms internet flags heart attack symptoms. 

I first joked friends possible plague march 17th cough. three months later *still* difficulty breath sometimes night. Last Friday, difficulty breathing near intensity first time thought might go hospital.

It's like worlds worst advent calendar even best days mean opened empty door.

And know sure got light. got expensive plague 2020 advent calendar. Lots people got janky dollar store advent calendar may may include things like time ventilator otherwise lengthy hospital says. 

And see pictures people crowded restaurants that's think about. Right? Honestly countries wearing masks even virus, they’re fine. deserve I’m getting real tired seeing headline hearing new provisions protect public... (TEXAS)   don’t get all. Fuck bat again. "" great example Singapore atm benevolent dictator

The problem comes future generations transition power. dictator lives forever next dictator might terrible. see especially Roman Emperors Monarchies good Kings/Queens bad Kings/Queens.

Goddamn stereotypical dumbass Americans ruining everything rest us.. Agree, doctors check vitamin people dark skin pigmentation appropriate recommend supplements patients darker pigmentation Thank this. always good least one source confirming case. sucks majorly lol would even work? Thousands police every day nothing knocking doors people supposed quarantining? would even figure travelers staying? don’t think realize huge US NY are. hundreds roads crossing New York states, many rural back roads. possible way track many people entry points. Uh entire market possible state (enforcing property rights, proving infrastructure, giving legitimacy tradeable currency etc) members social contract gives state legitimacy every right demand limitations businesses. Firms always try reduce labor costs means possible, inevitability completion.

 paying less Unemployment that's them, raise wages. think find money top Disney, need worry them. 

The holds true small businesses though, one right business pays poverty wages. Yeah. That’s bought masks. happened Surgeon General? couldn’t believe hearing time. 2000? Another one bites dust. highly infectious disease spreads talking closed space air flow. Vaccines take years, traditionally. Hence, treatment option realistically hope for. new disease remarkably resilient brutal every organ body. Nobody really understood respiratory till mid-March. Vaccines take time, years, least 1 year least 6-9 months. People working vaccine since probably early Feb. thought hospitals schools suddenly registered terrorist gathering locations? /s see “may become infected.” quarter Texans uninsured. government help people, get sick, different socialized medicine? Us Americans cling gun rights protect families, many people wear simple mask protect family.  Actually published CDC guidance isn’t ok bad. states patient enough follow it. stopped bleeding round 1, surprise they're eager begin round 2 Sometimes wonder country besides America deal people wearing masks readily available them. 'good guy gun thing stop bad guy gun' mentality 'a good guy mask stop death someone easily good guy gun'? people literally think continuing learn open fact first prediction could wrong updating outlook bad thing. That's stay stupid hold onto outdated opinions values entire lives. Canada please seem kind quarantine anymore large swaths people Theres comma. least call he; quite ironically, misspelled word. Also negative PR players start dying.

I know like think NFL players megafit super athletes ways...but significant number players job requirement (offensive &amp; defensive linemen) borderline clinically obese constantly putting way much strain organs. Maybe they'll fine think crazy suspect players may higher hospitalization death rates. think totally crazy spectators sports events, now. Honestly really good question. Seems like it’s set anyone goes parks knows risks involved would them. Given current tweets/comments testing/masks etc spike cases we're seeing across country, think we've got bigger concerns right now.

But personally wish President unnecessarily politicizing issues global pandemic. tiny fraction people bring vote, voted current admin state government brought upon us. Voting anti-intellectuals oppose scientific studies good practices might make look bad blame. 

But mostly blame human frailty arrogance.  Cuomo shit Connecticut wanted something similar beginning pandemic. wants this. God guy tool go February certain specific weeks events, get thing (low lines) WITHOUT virulent plague.

Crowd calendars great planning trip season.

US two oceans Virus, 6 week head start Europe, largest economy world, second largest manufacturing capability world, largest military world, CDC devoted *very issue*. US literally throw money order get ahead it, failed failed failed failed failed. 

NZ biggest asset competent leadership competent government. Island doesn’t mean shit virus got got foothold. Look UK. 

The US botch quarantine like everything else - government failed. politicians, entire government structure. failed you. 

And would like also point NZ actually several islands. one. pet peeve. Ya sorry US sports leagues. could sports back, like countries - large sections US bungled reopening spoiled rest us behaved. think two things happening (maybe 3):

1. date set current surge, looked like first wave winding down. dumb Disney business hiring listening epidemiologists anyone qualified evaluate type risk.

2. part happening acclimated risk, Disney looking capitalize disaster fatigue generally ""over"" coronavirus wanting get ""normal fun living"" perceived safer time year - Summer. even tho right, objectively less safe disney closed, people actually willing take risks, drained months careful. Disney literally sells notion leaving cares door returning simpler, fun state mind. literally care whether going disney good idea today lierally care whether going disney good idea family EVER - want go. Companies best bottom line only. Fuck health.

3. Desperation. (and likely many others) realize large portion Disney's revenue derived parks. always thought Disney media company makes movies tv shows Walt neat trick conceiving parks, basically for-profit advertising. much that. Disney's parks MAJOR source revenue, especially factor much money print dining, lodging, parking, souvenir sales. major, major racket, Anaheim Florida bending continue give undeserved tax breaks top. Disney selling movie tickets. selling cruises. lucky Disney+ showed did, pretty much Disney sell. mind, can't open Summer strongest UV rays least hospitable weather virus, hope reopening. 

And consider labor component. lot manpower goes running parks. longer people laid off, less likely Disney pick phone get functional, trained-up crew back onsite. Yep. Tourism-dependent states rough shape. Nevada Hawaii well. saying true. ITT:



 real forsythia Exactly. I’m seeing lot mental gymnastics. Evidence entirely truthful leads believe questions valid. idea says behind closed doors. one wants here, don’t worry. No, delivery guy one touches outside food made.

If infected, would theoretically virus hands, except respiratory tract.

Seems like people need touch takeaway packaging little possible reduce frequency takeaways demand personal right murder others. call non-right. worry, shame stop end July belittlement begin again! 

/s America 5% world’s population 25% cases deaths, deserve get shit on. interesting setting. Using saliva instead virus laden water droplets good idea.

The downside used bacteriophages replacement sars-cov2, likely due bsl-3 lab access. antibody tests USA banking case. 

Source: quote ""antibody"" tests:
""A positive test result shows may antibodies infection virus causes COVID-19, possibly infection related virus family viruses (called coronavirus), one causes common cold.""  Dumb. Americans travel Europe aren’t ones protesting masks. lord knows EU could use money.

EDIT: oh I’m sorry, EU definitely doesn’t need money - EU loaded. stop downvoting 🙄 Alternate timeline: federal government forces retailers wholesalers sell surgical N95 masks healthcare companies midnight announcement. CDC gives guidance using cloth coverings dust masks bandannas interim.

States implement fines non-compliance, incentive officers comply, give 20-50% commission fines collected. fact states definitely still states high rates infections locked never were. again, can't compare lockdowns Europe.

You could national strategy mandates states certain number cases implement guidelines others not. extent white house website guidance, never fully accepted put practice administration. Welcome ny. Cars coming tracked. went cashless tolls that. easily mail summons 
Appearance tickets. really wanted could easily track you’re here. 

Can catch every person? No. could easily catch enough day deter vast majority even attempting it. interesting setting. Using saliva instead virus laden water droplets good idea.

The downside used bacteriophages replacement sars-cov2, likely due bsl-3 lab access. Bruh...if already 5,000 without real mitigation measures place, ain't gonna plateau 3-4,000. talking US sports leagues? countries started back already. feel like lot people US dont realize wearing mask protects others, yourself.

And sense, wearing one selfish. call make back without formation now. US become new Italy hospitalizations filled brink Corona-patients, would good call. Otherwise, hospitals masks, US could lost... say 20% healthcare workers. would much bigger catastrophy health official lying public.

Fortunatly US come far.  reason people 50 need careful, people 70 need really careful.

But agree, even actually infected 10 million people still saw ton hostpialization lock down.

That’s great people still need pay bills put food table, government still needs tax revenue pay everything. link work I'm assuming edited title ask stupid ass question. Vaccine trials humans beginning 2 weeks Yeah that’s really smart. masks virus right? seem little understanding risk. They're hemmoraging money parks closed though. They're literally losing anywhere $20-40 million day depending source. reported loss $1.4 billion last year. can't afford keep parks closed indefinitely. DeSantis continued reject idea statewide mandatory masking policy, saying “I think catch flies honey vinegar.” Wait Opa supposed shoot Pfadfinders beach? sitting children helping work? Yes. best person give quality education? No. elementary school teacher. reason teachers must earn degrees licensed. said it, damage. notice say though, PERMANENT damage.

No one doubts causes damage (I’d say 5%). issue people, disease known 8 months, say PERMANENT damage.

And may earlier heat miserably sick, really long term issue basically athletics induced asthma never before, even going away point. probably also want gather large groups too.   People fought wearing seatbelts forty years. course does.  sacrifice he's willing make... now.

Eta: lol quote Desantis rejecting policy ""I think catch flies honey vinegar."" WTF even mean? mountain science says catch corona virus without mask. mask resistance latest example perennial struggle

\*before reading article\*

Science vs. Propaganda?

Wrongheaded right vs. exasperated left?

Sensationalistic pap vs. plain facts reported simply?

\*after reading perennial American struggle government veneration individual liberty . . 

Ahh. course. Bothsidesing basic health instruction. \*pphhthhthbhth\* Pass. thinking earlier today actually fucked sanctioning fuck countries is. literally like modern siege; try economical starve generally population turn government. mean guess better traditional warfare, still really fucked up, especially cases like Venezuela North Korea. mean, know complicated still, humans suck nit picky, different say different, try argue same. Either old advice we've always heard - wash hands regularly, stay home sick, cover mouth sneeze cough still sufficient - isn't. can't ways. Listen Kendrick's song ""Institutionalized"" sums black people largely predicament they're in. systemic Institutionalized. worst healthcare, education, opportunities race design. ruling class never thought would day access information would widespread people would able parse out. 

In way, Donald helped bring uprising awareness political system, especially young people looking thinking, level corruption possible America get fired reprimanded reason employer decides? pax taxes risk 5 years jail rich pay $0 taxes one bats eye. wonder people, regardless race, pissed need political representation actually tries right wrongs. Imagine thinking sub create trillions debt 😂 realize it. selfish. That’s refuse. Could also lifestyle  course did, many places even get test actively sick hospital let alone testing people moderate symptoms asymptomatic. liable child dumb shit parents supervise LICK HANDRAILS get sick?

who larger duty care towards children - Disney, parents? God please let one work. university going require everyone get whichever vaccine comes first really hope it’s one since it’s brand new development quite time. common cold usually caused Rhinoviruses Coronaviruses. think chance perhaps people infected common cold caused coronavirus might provide immune protection enough fight virus viral load becomes overwhelming.

Smallpox eliminated using cowpox (technically vaccina virus) vaccine, relatively harmless virus. People catch certain strains flu protected deadly strains flu. 

I think previous exposure harmless Coronaviruses could interested. could lead better vaccine. please stop, ive reported mods harrassment Instability due succession.

Confirmed, AI rule world forever. light ways lay agenda, including explaining patron ramifications actions.

""Ahh, sir mask works covering sources exhaling, mouth nose. really need job can't show up, but""... I'm really worried number asymptomatic people possibly transmitting virus nose. know personally would never want responsible death someone's grandparents, personally trying help grandparents get sick. know??""

And favorite line I've used far: ""The strong protect weak, wear mask strong"" That’s true, toll civilians Europe Asia awful. think it’s different enough though. Like alarms air raids — threat either immediate (planes incoming) (planes took different route bombing left). Yes, constant threat there, it’s different virus it’s kind always around, don’t know it’s concentrated. doesn’t seem rhyme reason flares affects. gambled lost.

Against loaded dice made house, everyone knew about. That's gambled Ah, Russian method. get groceries restaurant food delivered now. friends come back US recently two week stint quarantine baby Sydney. Also know part reason they're getting paid extra money they're getting due pandemic. Whenever that's set end, getting less money. Also part stipulation getting unemployment looking work. offered work refuse despite able to, qualify unemployment. We're going situation pandemic ends safe go back work, bunch people got laid furloughed refusing come back work they'd rather coast unemployment instead.  totally true. Hope begin vaccine trials humans late 2020 early 2021. doesn’t mean it’s ready public then.  *is* rare right now, mean important consideration. Even small percentage population several million (the total number school aged children UK) lot people carelessly putting risk little gain. I'm even saying avoid returning kids school better handle it, consideration complicates things. want end situation hundreds thousands dead children whose deaths would entirely prevented waiting months giving researchers time understand new syndrome. would agree however new complication alone really worth shutting schools for. one issue add list. 

When weighing costs benefits costs measured human lives permanent disability cautious approach simply prudent. would reckless act otherwise. SMRT favorite PERMANENT DAMAGE despite first known case even year old.

And, know, SARS patients often even worse damage healed back normal time. nope PERMANENT problem 5% population caught recovered, 50% Americans convinced 5%. 

Bay Area California salivating idea somehow caught earlier thought, along herd immunity death toll suggested. learned WAY far herd immunity. 

Sweden TRYING herd immunity making pathetic progress. 

America take idea use even reckless. pushing force school districts open mandatory in-person. I'm teacher. school districts trying offer mix in-person online, in-person prioritized students need (the young, special needs, children essential workers, etc.)  

Oh, still trying high school football.... think would work fair. decide cannot keep kids home? many unique variables among families children. might ""able"" pay homeschool still want child get person education. parent equally equipped teach, kids equally equipped stay home. 20% really high. I’m worried Arizona. Ew, read thousands posts one one try figure answer simple question. think I'll pass. would interesting Fair, Americans proved incredibly delicate really are

Poor insurance hospital visits

Poor smaller housing/hood/ tight knit communities/ living grandma cases &amp; spread susceptible people

Only link gotta bring community culture something haha conclusive yet police want NYC either 😂 course does, also many, many obligations carefull says. Fauci cant say vaccine likely take years, obvious mass-psychological reasons. RTCs carried effectiveness N95 respirators clinical settings - many - show **no** benefits stopping viral respiratory infections, difference make real world dynamic scenario? - logic argument.

The debate around face masks purely political one - one based importantly, can’t “prove” something doesn’t mean isn’t true doesn’t mean isn’t worth taking action on.

By logic - political leaders told shoving pickles nostrils would reduce spread Covid, would blindly would use critical brain find actually true make mind it? Singapore still flawed democracy. benevolent dictatorship occurred democracy. Maybe - it’s certainly victory, benchmark. like idea.

Would even better allowed leave get test, quarantine results.

Test prior arrival/ get would also increase amount testing done around US/world (when everything opens up) Heh! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fauci went Congress blamed system testing debacle boss complaining numbers going up. Trump said Obama's fault country prepared.

Something tells man lying. goes baseball players, several tested postive allready also. already European country right see issue? weren’t complete tool, he’d tilted cult followers healthy safe. could prove released birth certificate! Good news. No, think started US. Schools say hello. matter much anyone claims needed that, seed huge wave US specifically, even nations handle COVID better general specifically schools. US forge ahead ages schools sports ask everyone kindly sanitize hands (but blindness-inducing stuff nightmares) wear mask, fight every turn. 

America ""superspreading"" event world. first wave even crest weeks even months Florida, Texas, Arizona, California. Correct, i'm saying going fast. would think week would lot lower. Right? That’s representative government. One big problems New York realized central database hospitals space. create one epidemic. Ideally states saw created databases advance. Correct, i'm saying going fast. would think week would lot lower. Right? given letter passage quarantine started. (I work hospital.) one ever stopped questioned. Hahaha love comment. No, 25% said would ""about same."" linked data list explicitly article, know. lived it. It’s exhausting. Masks required entire state California, one's enforcing central Ventura County. DeSantis continued reject idea statewide mandatory masking policy, saying “I think catch flies honey vinegar.”

What hell even mean?

Does typically answer questions non-sequitur american idiom?

Governor Desantos, corona cases surging plan doing?

GDS: ""A Bird hand worth 2 bush.""

Governor Desantos, ICU beds running plan increase surge capacity?

GDS: ""Don't count eggs hatched""

Governor Desantos, even though many case amongst young people still spread older people. plan limiting community spread?

GDS: ""Time flies fun"" Yes, 'he knows play game' I'm looking for. That's politics. Yeah, listen people call country toilet continent “mature “ discussion that. You’re truly brilliant. know what’s see don’t you? 5500 exact, made 5000 club! US administration banned EU citizens early EU problem it

Not that. \[EU member state\] foreign ministries embassies happy organize expensive emergency returns stranded citizens, airport airline closes etc new restrictions get rolled out. makes perfect logistical sense block countries significant outbreaks.

I love they're pretending somehow stop spread reopen borders though. Lol nevermind, yall good work.  Disney announced plan month ago, defense, come knowing bad going be, optimistic. biggest employer Orlando, lot pressure least appear interested re-opening.

I fully expect revisit plan. based downward trend line COVID-19 cases reversed since made plan. They've made changes parks reduce spread, ultimately they're going spread disease open. I'll shocked open July 11, honestly, Universal Orlando SeaWorld already open. Crazier things literally already happened.  don’t get official title used one Russia's main news agencies report stage 1 vaccine clinical trials, sub's rules, faithfully translate wanted let know latest trials. translation comments contains quite bit info study design participants, hope people actually read (but suspect won't, usual.) clear, nothing US could done better March since matter nobody understood risk?

Or Europe gets free pass poor handling situation early on? went real scary shit March grueling, strict 90 day lockdown. know lots people effected/died take seriously wear mask. Unlike people South act like virus exist wearing mask ""freedom"". Pick random date say anything happens afterwards 2nd wave? misspelled 'leadership'. Back April going grocery store pulled highway, stoplight, young black guy panhandling. common spot handle, freeway ramps. difference time sad wearing homemade mask bandana.

I gotta admit, though first thought ""good, people wear masks"" second thought ""though usually someone walking car mask going wonder they're plotting crime.""

I give ten bucks socially responsible panhandling. People wear masks! STAMPS!! SELL THEM!! CALLED FRENCH? THIMBREEEES!! Fruit flies love vinegar, anyways. Oh I'm offended like handouts like working governor bonafide moron. care families, silly.  /s

I firmly believe Americans refusing masks someone immediate family dies. tried show friends many people 100,000 give visual clue many died, don’t get since US large. president says it’s flu big deal, believe him. “The media lies.” “The deaths reported.” honestly feel like I’m going insane days. sun couple hours, body synthesize much 10000 IU, going issues 5000  Agreed seriously doubt there's gonna NFL CFB season year. Logistically damn near impossible. $500 billion dollars go? mean, got $10 it, where's rest? Someone like probably realizes either walk away shitty situation let people die, stick around ignore Trump's bullshit right thing long without getting fired even care enough themselves...just think medical debt going hospital. Even end hospital, sick miserable. Even never get sick show symptoms, could still get lung damage. 

I'm wondering get tested mask blew away way outdoor meetup yesterday social distanced everyone except couple people exposed plenty sunlight. Sure. not? Well beginning 40% survival rate vent? Seems quite improvement, no? Bob Costas writing interview speak. Really? saw several stories beginning pandemic black men wearing masks accosted police assumed criminals. refused entry stores people inside wearing masks. impeach mods. delusional you? unfortunately Trump's antiscience stance makes greater evil? Ugh, lost faith democracy republicanism years ago. Thank God world wide relatively cheap, one move nations governments culture one actually take pride in. Nicotine keeps receptors otherwise occupied. vacancy. Solid 10% aware vaccine trials humans started months now? Pretty sure end honored. Holy crap. wealthy, get court order? call child endangerment. possible get custody order amended based this? appears used wrong clip. nothing statement discussed. Rudy Gobert got fairly sick everyone else yeah Uh literally entire world following American pandemic protocols except dun dun dun America. guess what’s happening elsewhere? Dun dun dun American protocols working. Whilst certainly helps D+ is, always be, peanuts compared massive cash-cow box-office Disneyland.

Of course, point would basically left revenue all(apart digital sales streaming licensing LOL) Disney+ hit scene time pretty much everyone kids home school. D+ save get helluvah bump streaming front, came crucial time.

As foolish, learned beginning year, pretty much everyone else too. Learning recently foolish, work entertainment finance. job know things give shit. ""Even Wall Street realized""??

US lost 0.037% population virus... Sweden lost 0.05% population virus... frankly US better EU countries... Maybe EU stop trying meddle US elections. Yeah, folks that. pandemic. I’m saying people stay lockdown, cutting unnecessary travel key. 

For example, it’s take sitting restaurant, get take out, leave slightly larger tip. America's mask resistance latest example, large portion American population selfish moron. Fixed title you, CNN.

Thanks info um NYC figured anything out, still shut horrible comparison places actually able open (asia). NYC sustainable economically. \*Hold steer I'm China-based, think one problems debate USA Americans just... know success *looks* like. 

Like, example, family back US asking ""ok, going eat restaurant mask on, actually work?"". real answer everyone just... takes mask they're restaurant. true there's certain element absurdity there! (ok, let's wear masks open airy street get small crowded restaurant let's take off...) key understanding ok **we needed least two weeks zero cases restaurants could open**. Everyone kind accepts absurdity, ok risk city cases... province lived (Guangdong) like low single digit daily cases among 120 million people.

Of *course* makes sense go eat mask Florida getting ~4000 cases/day among population ~20 million. East Asia, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe... intense lockdown period sorts numbers.

But course, can't lockdown forever. USA fucked first lockdown federal government bad job (because one two major political parties hollowed point military proper capacity act) devoid actual leadership executive branch. heavily doubt political second lockdown.

(and course, I'm China-based... queue incoming mandatory ""iTs fAkE!!! bIlliOnz R dYiNG cHinA!!!"") Well played. know good player nuggets pretty good well. another country even allowed back play??  cops sneaky

Are completely touch reality happening right country? friend mine, emergency room doctor, told fully 30% patients treated years called ""optimism bias"" - simply believe physical ailment end them, does. 

Example: patient told sh/e terminal lung cancer chance treatment, dead within three months. physician friend told many people ""optimism bias"" category believe going die, do. kind cognitive frame may good defense mechanism psychological stress re: illness onset, definitely harmful people bias thinking \*they\* going OK, fail consider infect others carrier (with without symptoms). full shit think base. America center personal freedoms. nothing anything person told wear mask losing freedom. happily ignore freedoms actually make principled stands weird shit.

They selfish core politics revolves around individualism.

Japan opposite America. People even jay walk there's cars following rules important. rules set people live harmony.

It's interesting look believe systems degree. pros cons each. Certainly comes pandemic, society like told despite good huge disadvantage. 

Freedom great USA showing freedumb lately. Wait - wasn’t guy said quarantining New York would considered Act War? ideas I've heard explain why, feel like credible human brain works. Lol...looks like boss really pissed of. Please ask boss come different strategy abusing people. getting way common social media.

You read comments without commenting yourself. it’s noted don’t reply. Oh shoot, must it. Scientists wrong, ain’t face masks need, it’s Mickey Ears! Except refuses go back reopening continues let every business operate full capacity. things supposed do,” Manning, 41, said. “We shut two months. cases started sprout up.”

Fauci medical community predicting sort scenario over. reason, pastor seems surprised. We're going see lot similar outbreaks rural areas. many rural states, rural counties densely populated states, cases due low population density. many people somehow believing covid ""skip"" area.

My little county 5 cases, months. last 3 weeks, increased 500% 25 cases. Hopefully people start wearing masks, maybe one 10 people grocery stores one last time out. Great! here, feel exhausting draining. great see months strict quarantining paid off! Yeah would track local rental company, cut dry. ""I get play action movie hero"" cool plays power fantasy, masks ""I'm scared I'm hiding virus"", undercuts illusion power.

Similarly, wearing mask gives power back. ""Yeah, there's virus there, PEOPLE scared it, me! I'm tough, I'm afraid! need mask!"" Vitamin deficiency FLU SEASON

Up intake vitamin D3 supplements COD LIVER oil (if person color) get fresh air outside masks, andyou fine. 

This assumes arent risk immune compromised group fatties, diabetics, smokers etc talking me. It’s harder. Ok? far decon disassemble wash down. filter. know lifespan. 

Anyway. pointless. one wear one (scary, threatening, embarrassed ) fact filters damn near impossible find. 

If paying attention agree effectiveness everything else. harder inhale thru (I explained) hard find (it’s getting better). You’re arguing benefits pointed caveats. 

Do see people wearing these? No? barely see people wearing anything. also right. yeah. Continue works, I’m one need evangelize to. speculated months already.

Similarly, I've speculating months bigfoot real, actually enormous weinmar dog learned walk hind legs. studies it, albeit small, many able walk hind legs sighted near woods.  40% - 60% Weinmar dogs might capable without human assistance. 😔 even worth arguing over.

Have great day. Drugs, probably. US - screwed? second wave, inside first wave, looks like hasn’t even come close peaking early opening states spiking. Yet, 30k+ new cases daily already. 


This well could reach 50k daily cases don’t see country even remotely trying lockdown again.  likely he'll get Nobel Peace Prize Presidential Medal Freedom Biden elected. Dumbfuckistan Heck, aspirin headache effective take feel coming on. Trump lost popular vote 3 million votes guys realize permanent damage done lungs COVID means career top-flight instant test positive?

Your health wealth. Ok that's obviously bullshit since federal government actively seized ppe intended workers, even months many still never got any. last sentence contradicts original post. masks arent necessary guess hes full shit now. Negligent homicide. dude, same. It’s like come much harder fail? country complete embarrassment. 
My gosh. Website domain checks you’re asshole who’s blatantly following rules. Pareto principle mentioned nothing recommendations political leaders. Bringing dumbest direction could pulled in, quite revealing what’s really mind.

And that’s even remotely close logic. You’re clearly smarter assume you’re trying agenda. 

Pickles inexpensive readily available, however, I’m fairly certain shoving nose would significant side effects, without multiple really strong clinical trials back would follow recommendation.

Vitamin supplementation also inexpensive readily available, however negligible side effects/risks (at recommended dosages). don’t even need see much clinical evidence, even it’s theoretically helpful I’ll take since anyway (or try get outside 15 min day).

Thats big part critical thinking that’s missing here.

Observational, population based studies used frequently determining effectiveness public health interventions, it’s uncommon all, it’s politics calling results question. want helpful try looking statistical differences exist. What’s happening populations high mask wearing compliance that’s leading better outcomes? Maybe they’re washing hands distancing better mask makes conscious situation. Sometimes it’s stupid works isn’t stupid. 

Gonna leave there, gotta get actual work done. don’t sneeze nose guess people do.  Ok, casinos product addicts people.

You one personal heroes time genuine role model many, many people.

Appreciate commitment good causes value insights.

Stay strong safe. matter. statements made accurate relevant. Europe changed course poor handling situation beginning. (Except Sweden)
US still handling situation poorly time. States opening without enough testing containing virus. matter fact, even leave homes all. could leave work groceries shopping (and mandatory go closest shop).

I go outside two months. Sounds like exactly should. weren’t happy wages left something better. Everyone opportunity, folks that, Disney would raise salaries ensure adequate talent. Good you! Going outside doesn’t mean sit restaurant 2 hours. Going outside taking jog garden taking hike etc.  people probably don’t understand sun comes from. could've tail end shit already, noooooooooooooooooo... dragging watching numbers go up, up, away... JFC... Missouri spent lockdown saying ""the cases Kansas City St Louis"" (which pretty true) ignoring risk posed them. cities cases dropped everyone said over. Except behind cover cities cases dropping getting worse rest state. huge outbreaks rural areas less likely able handle DeSantis - “And attach criminal penalties something got enforce it, question is, parts Florida really good use resources?”

Regular temp checks drop offs, hourly staff kids, obviously staff wear masks times- change gloves, extra cleaning nurse duty avail day. It’s daunting think hopefully point things return kind normal difficult said job many restrictions. need delay reopening. need reopening right!

That means mandating masks. means everyone staff visitors wearing masks properly... covering nose well.

Even simply vaccinating everyone age 70 start. Trump administration ending funding support local COVID-19 testing sites around country month, cases hospitalizations skyrocketing many states.

you know think I'm actually going read that, think I'm going go get beer fuck rest day done shit. Also- “COVID could revolutionize lots things forever” privacy laws (HIPAA) patients would attract trouble posted staff visitors. Patients may able post pictures only, theory. listen podcast called week Virology head infectious diseases Columbia Presbyterian ProHealrh, Dr. Daniel Griffin, discusses this. He’s concerned he’s seen happen. anyone else asks them, will.

Post yours, go away. I'm really well versed subject, something like Remicade considered biologic? I'm curious husband takes it. exactly think link supposed prove? 

That death *rate* back normal. many people died Sweden past two months normally die period historically. total number deaths higher neighbours, correct. exactly mean ""death rate""? Warren articulated well one debates hard check. look people know wear masks stores. Congress got take action regarding covid. People dying. I'm going similar trip, personal business reasons, I'm going work quarantine two weeks either side holiday.
It's really different telecommunicating lot people already. commonly used, though. Prob monthly infusion, gross! found fucking bed bugs. almost laugh Nice strawman! Good job! Right average *hospitalizations* younger well? would think cases among younger people yeah overall death rate would lower proportion older would still ones going hospital raising hospitalization rate, ratio hospitalizations deaths would still similar. Unless cohort younger people sick enough hospitalized still likely average survive cohort older people sick enough hospitalized? think I've seen age breakdowns level, guess could make sense, though.

edit:

I remembered good demographic data went back checked: compare hospitalization death rates age (page 15/16), pretty clear death rate goes dramatically age.

4% hospitalized 20's died

10% hsopitalized 40's...

and like two-thirds hospitalized 80's...

(Though numbers could skewed nursing home deaths never hospitalized?)

Still, age trend clear.

At time, percent hospitalized compared cases (page 14) slightly dramatically lower younger ages.

So, one hand, higher cases among younger people leading higher hospitalizations among younger people would expect lead lower overall deaths hospitalizations.

At time, since young people hospitalized, would take *a lot* cases among younger people hospitalizations get high enough make meaningful proportion hospitalizations significantly affect overall death rate.

I think enough data determine much factor new cases AZ/TX.

But interesting factors keep mind. point cannot truly social distance enclosed spaces. Masks minimally effective enclosed spaces (well dependent everyone wearing mask mask catching droplets, conceivably effectiveness goes way up). Eventually water droplets evaporate allowing virus go airborne. 

Once enough aerosolized virus, land longer enclosed space. homemade mask won’t help then.

It one person asshole. one person right conditions maybe producing large number viral particles maybe produces mostly aerosolized viral particles. I’d argue aerosolized virus source enclosed space generates super-spreader event. Better Second World, say. I'm starting see countries might welded people homes. again. explicitly didn’t want mad panic people buying PPE. 

Doctors medical professionals needed time. cdc along doctor tepid regarding masks.

Edit: Also, people assuming medical professionals lying? new virus, meaning information fluid. Folks put info got. better start posting peer reviews sources wild claims

And small studies people w/ autoimmune diseases, control groups, sample sizes 100 That's true, though. Y’all think people dumb reckless “ought know better” guys don’t realize it’s that, people straight don’t give fuck corona anymore  Jealous! bit enforceable since borders less complex Canada, still amazing. Totally anecdotal: got sick mid March, health authority would test due shortage. sick again, two months getting first round. Getting tested tomorrow.

I'm never going outside again. I'm not. Looking says that. 30% hospitals makes sense 30% overall.  seems like bullshit. Big business open. Small business closed. Safety subjective. 😂 whatever, asshole even read analyzed data 9,358 patients younger 50 years COVID-19 Jan. 20 April 24 included COVID-19 Research Network database 37 global health care organizations, 36% United States.  patients study, 33.2% hospitalized severe COVID-19 symptoms.  ischemic stroke occurred 0.7% patients. Compared patients without ischemic stroke, likely older (39.3 years vs. 36.7 years; P &lt; .001), although similar proportion women (60.9% vs. 60.4%; P = .93). addition, patients ischemic stroke higher prevalence comorbidities including diabetes (32.8% vs. 6.5%), hypertension (61% vs. 11.7%), HF (15.6% vs. 1.5%), obesity (46.9% vs. 17.4%) prior history stroke (28.1% vs. 0.5%).

Wow, less 1% people actually types strokes happened underlying conditions make COVID-19 dangerous.

Stop fear mongering. virus shitty month two vast majority younger people.

Here's another article always risk becoming seriously ill, chance someone 40 ending hospital quite low. fact, rate hospitalization people test positive coronavirus 20s 4%, Centers Disease Control Prevention. 60, rates go way up, 20%. fatality rate people 20s 30s without underlying health conditions 0.1%. Lol survive pretty sure step #1 next time. So, effective quarantine? quarantine necessary, half-ass it? NY hard-core quarantined back then, possible likely spread states would significantly slowed. like disaster movies 

Or, know, like response global pandemic generational severity. sure now. I'd coming quarantine days scheduled leave, so, looks like need get phone airline today.

Maybe next year better. Thanks resource. Haha ok never mind people saying take 5 years need go back July 15. safe. Yes, right many (maybe point, I've honestly lost count bit) countries Europe bar Swedes entering *and* discourage citizens traveling there. case long Sweden relatively high caseload. drugs dampen cytokine response. target different parts response (mine stops IL17, one OP stop IL6). probably likely get virus immune response dampened, thing kills appears cytokine storm. drugs dampen storm. listen liar? Stop racist bigot look data. Exactly. Also southern regions. may sound bad maybe virus “took out” vulnerable ran it’s rounds. it’s running general working population typically younger healthier shouldn’t critically affected.

My guess vulnerable know taking measures protect point Yeah exactly. hot much south/southwest rn. high Phoenix 110F today. let know requirements run camp state fairly strenuous. Can't share tents, shared equipment without cleansing, bathrooms cleaned twice day, can't attend camp without negative test result within 7 days arrival, visitors camp, anyone leaves must restested, twice daily temp checks, mess halls run current restaurant guidelines, etc. business usual. Maybe worthy celebration couldn’t see much better countries done. terribly compared countries competent leadership. City Sao Paulo alone [is estimated 1.2 million surprising me. drinking ever last months spend time chatting playing card games family. City Sao Paulo alone [is estimated 1.2 million flipping channels saw match TV. assumed re-broadcast something pre-coronavirus, stands full nobody wearing masks. 

I googled discover live match coronavirus. shocked. 

I get wanted try hold event masks social distancing. none - wow. Thread locked getting political something stupid isn’t enough sarcasm justice. friends plan buy house blows over. horrible going lot Land grabs Florida time next year.  maybe switched death rate goes wrong direction, seems inevitable, thank Florida Arizona. Coming big death totals today.  idea. absolutely yes. multiple fact. Well everyone well aware still opting listen excuse keyboards grammar check kiddo reported susceptible 

This false. Check Vox. June 4 edition ""No one knows Covid-19 patients’ symptoms keep relapsing."" articles national outlets, recall, read magazine daily. interprovincial travel banned without 14 day quarantine Canada. enforced well, allowed multiple provinces drop current actives cases 0. know political/ideological bias. democratic country 1.3B people like India requires masks everyone abides them, cannot believe country 4 times smaller can't enforce simple life saving pandemic stopping measure. country pathetic mess accept it. People still gonna brave theaters. downplay seriousness 

Then proceeds downplay seriousness bullshit

Again, really stupid fucking example. winning one. actually disturbing news... informed 2021 much, better 2020, take years us recover. Imagine big business firm type outbreak hospitals, prisons, ICE detention camps, meat packing plants seeing. White suburbanites would surely outraged then, right? way treat 'least these', Biblical phrase goes, disturbing US show publications respected journals reasonably assume experts aware of, making statements contradicting them, could give reason assume lying.

Even disregarding whole asymptomatic thing, masks already shown peer-reviewed science reduce chance flu-like, viral infections. Examples:  speaking, ""lying"" assumed malicious.

Generally speaking would agree, original comment talked healthcare workers, explicitly said (and maybe missed it): ""The intentions good ..."" hope understand ""asymptomatic"" ""pre-symptomatic"" thing.

The thing we're talking ""being contagious showing symptoms"". refer asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. judged benefits great enough public recommend wearing masks.

It's true official CDC pages never explicitly said ""masks nothing general public""; however, instances health experts/authorities making exact claim, several articles circulating quoted saying reason people wear masks amounts pure superstition. Example: chatting someone Tennessee work yesterday, saying Ontario, Canada almost opening businesses (with appropriate precautions, course) basically said they’re worst spot, near that, kind like 3 months ago. I’m hoping we’re really strict border it’s reopening I'm surprised guy still hair left, considering many times must felt like pulling hair out. disease referring greed self interest. creating climate change preventing us resolving it. people frequently wearing masks nightclubs, restaurants, bars Japan? even work? could speculate excess deaths MAY caused Covid every state. point is, it’s speculation.

I don’t like bashing Florida done much better lot states there.

Now slim chance become next epicenter rack thousands deaths, I’ll eat words people get ***at start, eventually might***.

That 1% today. going stop spreading. 1% become 2% 3% knows end number be, say, 10 years time? that's keep hearing median age cases going down. gone started testing younger people. That's all.

The Kremlin praises fight corona virus particularly successful. Russia actually better position terms death rate Italy, example - official statistics raise questions.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director Emergency Programmes, recently called corona statistics Russia ""unusual"". Unusual number deaths reported government remarkably low compared countries. Nearly 8400 deaths last reported Russian Government. Germany currently almost 8900, 43 percent fewer inhabitants.

But doubts Russian data. capital Moscow, epicentre corona crisis Russia, published new statistics deaths. According this, total 15,700 deaths registered metropolis May 2020 - normally figure around 10,000. surplus 5700 Muscovites die of? Corona pandemic cause?

If one follows daily reports Corona side government, one notices number Covid-19 deaths Moscow May, however, increased 2000 most.

Why figures differ much? Russian authorities embezzling corona deaths? conceal extent pandemic order better off, even global comparison?

One answer is: Russia, corona death matter definition.

As standard procedure, almost deceased persons autopsied country, including suspected corona virus. strict distinction made: Covid-19 leading cause death? person die another disease, also infected corona?

Other statistics according media reports

Unlike countries, Russia far published death figures category one - died corona. least that's changed now. First city Moscow published detailed list Corona deaths, matter died Covid-19.

And Rosstat, Russia's state statistics agency, followed published figures regions Russia. According figures, 1660 people died corona virus April - another 1052 died infection.

However, authorities reacted Russian international media reported contradiction published low corona deaths increase overall mortality.

English language newspapers even threatened Duma deputies withdrawal accreditation. Foreign Ministry spoke ""disinformation campaign"" attempt ""destabilize situation"".

The violent reactions make clear explosive Russian officials estimate number corona deaths. circumstances impression given situation control. President Vladimir Putin recently emphasized state television ""minimal losses"" corona pandemic - compared USA 120,000 deaths.

Indeed, excess mortality Moscow second largest city, St. Petersburg, hardly compared figures New York City Madrid, following chart shows. Russia's corona balance sheet date flawless. terms excess mortality, example, Moscow clearly ahead Bavaria, German state one hardest hit corona.

Just differently Russia's local authorities collect corona data shown look death statistics published Rosstat 85 regions, including annexed Crimea. SPIEGEL evaluated them.

In Nizhniy Novgorod, oblast east Moscow, data indicate April less third corona deaths said caused virus, rest considered died ""with corona"". Moscow Saint Petersburg, proportion died corona around 50 percent.

In Moscow region Caucasus republics Ingushetia Dagestan, hand, category ""died corona"" hardly ever used - proportion ""died corona"" least 90 percent corona deaths.

The dynamics pandemic huge country - similar USA - vary greatly region region. regions already passed peak infection, others still come.

This also confirmed number newly infected people every day, reached peak May 11,600 cases currently 8,000. Russia testing much countries far 17.5 million tests, almost 600,000 positive. Germany, hand, reported 5 million tests, 192,000 indicated infection.

The following heat map shows number new infections reported daily selected regions since beginning March. comparison, four countries Germany Italy included below. Blue stands low numbers daily new infections, red highest daily case numbers ever recorded - white medium numbers.

There's nothing residency makes someone less susceptible. Vermont something like people state, live near border move back forth. 

It's frustrating difficult, certainly seems working degree. Fuck, sorry. Fucking LOL. infected NY'ers fled Florida March. good luck that. Nobody going able watch ""quarantined"" people 24/7. Hawaii also literal island. lot easier enforce everyone coming going go one two airports way island. probably hundreds different roads ways New York. hurricanes, one main reasons. Judge: wear anyone else see town hall meeting OC? Shit ridiculous, favorite person screaming locusts Africa  mean Fredo?

Member filmed coming quarantine thought didn’t know lying? I'm sure that's good idea. overwhelmingly vast majority individuals recover home, without medical intervention. 

Suppressing immune system early may lead inability fight COVID-19 secondary infections. bet humidifier fill fucking holy water lol No, live actually supressed begin responsibly open up, government took seriously. I'm stuck basement like Florida couple weeks. know dude got pinched sneaking Yukon locked tighter went back contacted found public posts it. Hes still though Ok LA's share cases actually declined; one point half COVID cases. areas outside LA getting significantly worse, County. ohio State Florida around 100,000 confirmed cases. Italy 239,000 confirmed cases. 

I think math maybe off. even halfway days either 😭😭 prevalence lung damage caused Covid-19 still early thought mild form disease unlikely suffer permanent damage. hospital, particularly intensive care severe infection, vulnerable complications.

Research still early stage. Particularly intensive care severe infection vulnerable. New Zealand makes apply visa two week quarantine mandatory testing. feel like that's happy medium. mean shit America months ago. US totally dropped ball continuing to. That's imperial county CA getting hit hard. good percentage workforce lives Mex comes across border daily work. called border crossing visa quite common. lot bad information comments I'm going give perspective Immunologist.

The concept herd immunity complicated, especially correctly said people never truly documented happening course natural infection throughout history (most pandemics past ended changing cleaning practices) knowledge based mostly vaccination.

One thing see lot general misunderstanding scientists mean say herd immunity. Herd immunity definition point large enough percentage population immune point new outbreak cannot START. That's important part here, start. Colloquially pandemic started use term describe percentage people can't get disease. difference herd immunity threshold needed new outbreak happen high (estimated 60-80% virus) new infection needs reasonably isolated anyone susceptible. people talking 25% people immune partial herd immunity technically correct, yes could slow R0 slightly nothing prevent another large scale outbreak.

Second point, percentage need reach herd immunity. complicated controversial enough data letting diseases rage population. classical calculation based inverse R0 would put 60-80%. However, many mathematical models say percent could actually much lower due differences susceptibility movement different populations. Quick example people ride bus lot likely spread virus lot different people, people infected takes away huge method superspreading drop Reffective substantially. estimated 25-45%, estimates used policy decisions.

Final point, immunity. respect credentials person interviewed concerns valid. However, data immunity long lasting great right taken grain salt (especially new 2-3 month antibody paper). experts talk daily life see evidence yet say virus ""abnormal"" claims terms generating immunity. also likely big differences immune system responds infection common cold coronaviruses may important. can't say 100% people immunity forever, enough evidence right say goes away fast, would highly highly unusual based seeing far antibody cell responses.

So end day, herd immunity infection probably really viable strategy highly damaging simple mask usage even need worry that. probably would technically work everyone world (or even smaller scale) got infected reasonable amount time. No, meant they'd pat back. reason people like allowed emigrate anywhere.

Because Abbvie would go bankrupt did. Single-diseasedly propping pharmaceutical industry bankrupting countries around globe! want make sure everyone reinforces best safe practices wearing mask, hand sanitation, maintaining safe distance, importantly, spread rapid right now, **there’s never reason leave home unless need go out**,” Abbott said. “The safest place home.” fucking interview back forth one Mom liked better cringy. Chronic fatigue misleading term. much worse seems. least concerns happens country's national government bungles response incredibly badly... much unnecessary death. Meanwhile.. Americans coming Canada vacation, saying they're way Alaska. Still used platform shitting Sweden pretty commonly known ""benevolent dictator"" far effective best form governance. good luck finding someone capable remaining benevolent entire reign, also raising perfectly benevolent heirs pick they've retired.

This going sound stupid exact thing World Warcraft guilds. would massively convoluted point systems earn points hour raiding group, different rates earning progress nights throwing new bosses hours end without reward. various items point costs associated drop players able bid.

Collectively 40-50 person team, literally spend hundreds man-hours every year tracking points, figuring best spend yours, taking time bidding boss kill, checking points guild's website. much damn work order create system that's supposedly fair...and yet still kinds huge glaring problems.

Then hand, got guilds items drop, ""loot council"" 2-3 people chat second figure best person give item to, that's it. Zero overhead huge stats tracking systems, people unbiased rational possible talk make call.

And way LESS drama guilds system whole points tracking systems.  Yup. what's amazing many exponential processes. 		Cases		Deaths		Fatality Rate
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Sweden		60,837		5,161		8.48%
  World		9,273,922	476,715		5.14%
  Denmark		12,561		603		4.80%
  Finland		7,155		327		4.57%
  Norway		8,772		248		2.83%

It seems Norway particularly well, Denmark Finland better world average. Meanwhile, Sweden particularly badly, numbers well excess global average.

Here number think about: Sweden makes 0.13% world's population, 1.08% world's reported deaths COVID-19.

A little 1 every 1000 people live Sweden, 1 every 100 deaths occurred Sweden. study uses assumption flu-like symptom presentations excess normal year (2018) COVID. horrible assumption. flu many times life gone doctor/clinic it. flu March/April year course would gone get tested. really dangerous irresponsible make people think already it. many friends family saying ""Oh well got really sick Dec/Jan/Feb, think already it."" makes people think antibodies one also go around telling people, ""oh bad. think already it, like flu."" irony... I'd like say getting ""stuff"" together turn around quickly; can't even figure wear masks. think valid possibility. one input? Science based ideal. Yup. dumbass also really read article responding title lol. 

It’s definitely intentionally click bait IMO, honestly thought missed Brady testing positive COVID-19 headline alone No, province's emergency orders. provinces don't. international travel federal quarantine act though. don’t know you’re downvoted, currency benchmark every currency financial woes world’s financial woes large extent. don’t think anyone stupid enough impose active sanctions US like Russia, think thought experiment.

Notice China also never gets hit sanctions despite CCP shadiest things world. That’s US China leaders global economy, tread lightly could big trouble.

EDIT- guys downvote want, doesn’t change fact there’s chance countries place sanctions US. Oh yeah, agree. getting complacent, probably part due warmer weather. sure Trump pretty negligent shit, small meetings behind closed doors him, stooges Fauci. Stuff years crazier we’ve heard publicly. We're like half way there. people actually take seriously like opinion matters. love Bengals I'm going put stock football player's opinion matter.

Everyone opinion days instead admitting actually people intillegent are. I’ve worried protestors get detained arrested. held buses jail cells would at-risk time. 

I would also assume would protestors likely seek testing. know many people held/arrested Massachusetts? hundred thousand people commute city state every day? gonna shit Sen Jackson also states yesterday actually confusion number people hospitals Covid counted. NC started elective procedures everyone tested. It’s unknown people hospital another procedure test positive counted total number people hospital COVID. stated working determine numbers people COVID-19 vs hospital virus. I’m trying downplay seriousness per Senator Jackson(who amazing, unbiased, transparent, communicative representative months now, one kind)there may misrepresentation terms hospitalization numbers. mah freeeeedommm !!!!! Canada make us pay tbh. studies showing may case enough variability susceptibility transmission. come where. true see happen NY since antibodies levels near %20  NC (atm) roughly 1/8 countrys population around 350 new cases per day. Get shit together america. Please. ""Strong"" comment pandering people see world way. personal view.

You'd way know course..

.. guess easy tar feather people jumping conclusions know nothing them.. aren’t facts — it’s called conspiracies. Wait, really say go unless need go out?

Me: need go out.

Also me: Why?

Me: dunno, tacos?

Also me: Well guess need go out. narrator: wasn't. Fauci guy Trump standing next make seem credible. one point, Fauci said president hadn’t talked two weeks.

Fauci leading corona virus response. Mike Pence Trump’s son law are. stating facts sweetheart. Get it. media shite show literally like watching train wreck UK study. gave press release last week. article made public yesterday one gets detained. get sent quarantine hotel. happens lot Asian nations, currently foreigners banned countries anyway, people entering nationals. people escaped early COVID waves still trying return China.

With said idea quarantine makes sense, US we'll fight end. I'm going vacation Central NJ Upstate NY six days. Hotel called told us allowed NJ ID. take grain salt mean, least face mask get walk around looking like ninja. everyone ignoring badass look? NBA won’t happen. applaud trying, isn’t going work. get lot hate, obviously right. nobody saying reply comment wouldn’t getting downvotes. 

Some people want EU ignore fact US dollar benchmark currency place form sanctions. don’t realize sanction country benchmark currency, you’re also sanctioning economy.

So let’s play out. EU places sanctions US, economy goes it. wouldn’t even statement US much would statement Eurozone. extrapolate census data January 2020.

That's it... checked number one Statistics Sweden here:

 

I working wrong figure. Mea Culpa. calculations agree now. God leadership fucking horrible. Literally damn dog could better job. True. Also keep mind glass module lungs ongoing thing. Also think that's pipedream forever immunity. We've one CV infection past. 

With said, one destroys lungs, causes thick blood, stroke, heart arrhythmia heart attack, seems carry viral load, kidney failure etc points cumulative effect like polio paralysis.

If theres immunity, viral load, matter time infects everyone. destroys body effects ele.

It's pretty picture. one really taking we'll generation people disabled illness, rivaling polio survivors 1950s. kid president mad someone Massachusetts, watching NY schmucks flee state, that's fucking rich.  Yes. ... Come fall hospitals overrun. summer now...fall comes normal flu plus this?

Some scary stuff horizon EU going place sanctions US currency global benchmark, can’t place sanctions country benchmark currency without economy taking hit process.

(Also EU stable American progressives tend think is, EU harming economies sanctioning US would strengthen Euroskeptic movements EU countries). remember correctly, police would also follow confirm self-quarantine. Nobody saying reject US goods money, people. really block us flying pond.

They inflated stocks rather saving emergency. (Which we, actual people, supposed else say oh well) like innocent. 

But problem comes businesses keep getting bailed turn leads inflation cost living going up. Meanwhile federal minimum wage (7.25, less tip workers get fucked greedy companies) still less half congress suggests minimum people country need live. (See CARES Act full bipartisan support 600 unemployment per week translated $15/hour 40hr/week.) call precedent. could easily go 15$/hrs without companies raising prices causing inflation. Inflation caused greedy companies, minimum wage. (This leads back inflating stock numbers relevant)

Edit: clarity, clearly businesses this, big corporate bailouts seperate issue small business actually need bailed out. say, Canadian, number 1 fear right Trump demand borders open up. Legitimately terrifying thought (especially BC, we’ve managed get 14 people hospitalized province 5 million people). sorry guys fucked around! Actually happen viral infections. 

Since known contact confirmed cases symptoms, bit fence it. Imagine halfway February, Australian fire department said ""We're considering something bush fires"".

That's vibe get. I've never seen somebody blink many times row. switch socially distanced stripper delivery drive strip dances la I’m Louisiana traveled Florida twice. answer question.... no. I'd say contention ""minimally effective"" misleading - people properly wearing masks, still pretty effective preventing spread. 

The longer stay enclosed space someone shedding virus, higher chances catching it, even several hours, everyone masked risk stays relatively low. think he’s got backwards. People quarantined visiting New York. hospitals full, number deaths absolutely explode. new patient point on, hospitals even exist.

Sure, pneumonia sucks. really, really sucks treatment available. Also keep mind people hospitalized today people got infected 2-3 weeks ago. hospital capacity reached, locking society already late.

Some months ago predicted stock market would also crash. time I'm sure, since become abundantly clear stock market completely decoupled economy whole. Dow Jones index simply graph showing feelings rich people.

Edited: Typo knew watching major border crossings people reporting states plates. brother lives Cranston told basically everyone took seriously. people followed lines super markets, went individually instead groups, respected social distancing. Yeah still crazies idiots near bad I've seen 5-10 minutes border CT. Despite second population dense state 2/3 hour drive two major epicenters country, they've kept numbers super low. Basically, actually tried listening medical professionals recommended believe working. know 2 meters far enough reducing even dumb move course going get worse. masks well social distancing? could possibly go wrong? really issue. seems unnecessary call ""record"" overall trend new cases every day ~3 months. I'm honestly surprised every state sooner. Thanks, mate!

That's interestingly worded article. mention Sweden once, instead confirming guidelines/threats apply number unnamed countries. mentions 14 day quarantine, article appears worded way risk getting fired even spend days vacation. used Dexamethasone iontophoresis PT clinic worked at. wonder treatments similar. believe anti inflammatory. used purpose lungs? Well you’re looking places I’m seeing then. totally agree. also think way people parent's age ingest news biased. like said, Fox news local news you. Funny thing, recently made mom reddit account use hopefully peruse unbiased take news within subreddits. Authoritarian regime complete control news data. honestly believe numbers? closed months state probably hard enough time trying enforce parole, hell would enforce this? That's always try say ""ban guns easily hide guns go pewpewpewpewpew, pew-pew-pew-pew. make shoot bullets need reload.""

you get idea.

and lag different case, since april cdc stopped reporting cases occurred patient reported. since april bad time data. Antibodies present body actively fighting infection little thereafter. immune system still know produce antibodies needed memory B cells cells shown good imprinting fight virus long term.

So yeah, wrong. highest number daily deaths far? Ad hominem bad look side this.

Not every job done home, vast majority office jobs be. Keeping office workers home instead desk work take indoor ventilation question equation - long someone individual air system residence apartments condos do, there's risk spreading indoor air circulation. hand office building might hundreds even thousands people sharing recirculated air.

Cloth masks adequate protect people sharing small unventilated space either, tribalism around masks adds confusion. either pro-mask anti-mask black white people's minds.

Do search ""coronavirus asymptomatic"" engine choice, restricting date exclude recent couple months. based actual scientist findings, baseless hunch general public. There's even pdf flyer page (but called ""pre-symptomatic""), scientific study plastered CDC page dated April 3, scientific study dated back that's ones found glance.

All bullet points healthcare workers suggest healthcare workers need *more* general population, masks useless general population. one group people worse doesnt mean groups problems disappear. hospitalizations gone up.

Could see spike week six? Perhaps, since seen increase week four, seeming less less likely could take six weeks, certainly wouldn’t take every single case six weeks reported.

This good point agree part. problem see this: 1st gen mostly young, healthy people low risk severe symptoms, thus less *likely* get tested become ill. *That said* Denmark, held special press conference try get everyone 15k+ demo get tested, reportedly many did. DK anyway, widespread even mild probably would registered now. familiar situation MN, Norway (BUT! Norway *incredibly* low active caseload low risk imo). 

I guess *potential* see is: 1st gen, young + healthy, showing signs, lots false negs PCR. Subsequent gens similar (not getting tested slightest symptom anymore though since feel risk 1st gen did), go infect many risk groups *those* start showing up.

That said, stress: *I 100% agree unlikely*. see theory possible. gut, analysis data, say probably right here.  Arizona hit 3,000 new cases tests taken last Tuesday. fucking insane. full, full surge numbers even masking, let alone locking down. Every day last week already 2,800 (except friday, fully reported yet. Monday even fully reported) logic behind Roman Republic's role Imperator. time crisis, one man would elected senate make decisions, state held back disagreements infighting. always short-term deal, guys started taking much liking power started refusing give up. going interstate commerce federal responsibility?

Also, guy justifying also sent infected people back nursing homes full elderly people, causing thousands deaths?

Haven't enough Ken-doll politician? Frightening stupidity.... would argue isn’t stupid all...in fact, think he’s brilliant, stupid act form misdirection. 

Take words trump look actions. Every action taken greatly benefited one party: Russia. He’s actively taking side Corona, trying get bad possible. He’s destabilizing Middle East creating strong anti-American sentiment (killing lead general January because). He’s basically gave Russia military base Ukraine literally money all. full backing federalist society (a Yale/Harvard think group responsible Barr, McConnell, 5/9 supreme justices, metric shit ton district judges), funded by...you guessed it. Russia (research medallion fund info). He’s actively fueling racist divide America. Every time makes headline saying something stupid, something behind scenes. He’s pro misdirection longer believe he’s bumbling idiot, stuff gets away with. arguing death tally accurate. sad really, general public sign lab rats. said, hope sakes' works get vaccine soon. didn’t think before, sharing around bongs, reefers, sips drink people’s glasses get taste drinking... well don’t think it’s good idea working vaccine created. voter suppression tactics like KT closing 95% 3,700 polling places primaries, leaving 625,000 people Louisville single polling place, I'd say 3rd world democracies hella better job freedom-ing America...

Canadian played how? people told wear face masks there’s surge cases people listening professionals people stupid? Yes let’s blame citizens guess w/e Again, buddy (2:1 odds it’s Brian group) bike path yelling people stay home wear masks. know lot epidemiologists physicists group feel free correct we’re riding opposite directions bike path don’t slow chance spreading anything basically zero That's assuming contracted virus immediately quarantine, there's reason believe would true majority infected people. Preben. else. Obviously (;

Her point geared towards beginning society democracies go choice time. weird seeing parallel point playing modern day

Like, ideally one, competent, leader situations need quick decisive action like pandemic could easier manage 

Authoritarianism sustainable slightest I'm advocating it. thought experiment 👍🏻 lot people questioning **China** ‘s (90k) confirmed cases much lower **United States** (2.4 mil). Instead bringing conspiracy theories, strongly believe it’s different countries different reporting standards.

In early days outbreak March, Chinese authorities consider symptoms **pneumonia** along coronavirus confirmed case. Everyone China emphasized associated virus pneumonia. Furthermore, Chinese authorities consider asymptomatic carriers confirmed COVID-19 cases (they even separate figure asymptomatic carriers).

Therefore, US adopted China’s reporting methods, number confirmed cases likely reduced 80-85% (since actually pneumonia around 80% mild (less pneumonia) asymptomatic symptoms).

Do guys agree above? testing do, cases you’ll see. said people, slow testing! 

This would funny story literally didn’t come Feds bailing Texas testing ""So what?"" even believe they're saying, talking points muddy conversation. immunocompromised? fine. gets 140, kill virus, that's good news....I guess. Fauci came said never asked slow testing. mean happen, that's interesting. gonna lie: WFH great.

Will probably WFH rest year, maybe seek permanent WFH position over. highly likely Covid end career, unless he's lucky mild illness. Decreased lungs performance good thing playing tennis. finally napped real one replaced double? Testing capacity changed within past month.

A month ago contact suspected COVID person, let test unless person tested positive. think could actually get tested reason want. Dude sorry say prez acted quickly rather ridiculously america could somewhat control. warnings downgraded seasonal cold misinformation started kill ppl. Wait, what? people took antibody tests sick? confused. everyone tested COVID once? you? Fucking Barry, fucking show tunes break room. *told* tone fuck down. Everyone assumed democracy right way go. Turns getting everyone agree harder thought. barely made progress hour half

Well, right way go. Reaching consensus hard requires compromise. slow messy frustrating - that's feature, bug. 

But authoritarianism - especially I'm one autocrat - surely allure! Remember sneaking cauliflower mashed potatoes? lot deleted arguments I've got mask around neck!

In Indiana, we’ve opened 5 stage plan. applauded Governor Holcomb whole way. still don’t see majority people wearing masks see older, heavier people wearing cases. 

We got snippets freedom stage, think plan perfect getting risk population listen wear masks. lied masks first. blood couple thousands hand We’ll see packed churches, everyone crowding singing together...I think it’d beautiful know type talking about. live different side town one signs US 1 alternate. damn shame.

Please post sources. country spent trillion dollar year army couldn’t feed citizens one month? cases falling, one month would probably enough. Look EU, managed it.

Trump governers reopened early keep corporate owners happy. Reopening them. Don’t kid people would starve crap. can’t get answers without knowing many asymptomatics were. would idea tested **everyone** didn’t (and many places still aren’t). Antibody tests aren’t completely reliable immunity isn’t long lasting would people even antibodies tests look 6 months? mention research disease focused treatment vaccines since *more important* moment. 

We may never get answers unfortunately. Seconded. people sometimes ask death mental illnesses. People depression bipolar sometimes feel suicidal. (I doubt case here, never know)  Provincial boarders never manned Canada. 

Honestly I’m hoping you’re moving legitimate reason breaking rules. imagine someone report licence plate point. It’s higher 3,200. saying pneumonia cause death many thus keeping Covid death rate low. Also, deaths lag behind hospitalization. may couple weeks see high death rate may get FL. may hit 27K know better methods treat Covid cases NY, could well get 10K time said done FL. NY, doctor even knew treat since new hospitals little better understanding treat. someone “recovers” doesn’t mean won’t reduced lung capacity rest lives.  wasn't, send message modmail. learned law? Imagine thinking know world’s best minds subject read anecdotal stories articles internet. live UK wondering didn’t LA reopen everything recently handling virus quite well beginning? got friggin kidding me... posting since beginning, one Chinese studies legit. China administering everyone proven extremely effective.

This whole time people understand virus threat bodies immune system response causes massive release damaging inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 (which medicine inhibits). Hydroxychloroquine helps early medicine helps point. reason people understand despite steroids antimalarials antivirals patients began worsen organs begin shutting cannot even process medication. tried spread awareness it, good see light shone onto lifesaving medicine. Ya know would worked? Lockdown 4 weeks. would prevented disease spreading, given time isolate infected person, limit a/pre symptomatic spread virus.  going need pace next two weeks human coronaviruses confer immunity 3-12 months. Assuming one somehow different recipe disappointment. possible self-administer hospital-grade ventilator home might need it? so, else would need watch reason unable go hospital even get infected (Hospital overflowing patients.)

I need ready take care others event can't go. how's going work closed border? canada enough grips actors? know people hate I'm supporter think missleading world --- CHO, AMERICAN donated much money since never fucked C, experience sars firstly trust organization even full lies money manipulating C.
C trust worthy, 10years ago sold poisoning dumpling Japan made people die always do. sold bad oil Taiwan many people got cancer.They sold fake rice Africa, even sold fake powder milk country many babies injured... etc. trust anything wrote simplfied CHN anyways.
They even got famous browser eventually found wrapped Chrome inside.They ""salesforce"" avoid copyright, proud tab length 1mm different salesforce.You really see shameless face.I hope donate anything copycat anymore.

Other understand people still arguing C hide outbreak, video, mayor Wuhan went TV show apologize needs follow report line caused 500millon people went world spreaded virus. saw news days, man wants suit C government hide outbreak moved injured father Wuhan, father got infected one hospital informed them.Rediculous country poor people. since raised intigation, got harrased goverment, police came house talk him,The comments news people pray hurted C goverment... stop make C strong sending money lower human resources instead quality? want eat anything poisoning fake. I'm really pissed seriously. illustrates glaring weakness federal system dealing situation like this. needs uniform national policy terms making sure everyone following guidelines since it’s political issue states saying fuck it. that?

More importantly, enforce it? New York State pretty long land border. Plus one busiest ports world... HONEST. comparing two countries. Didn’t think would explain one, are. want believe countries data that’s you. 👍🏼 president came said wear mask, would 90%+ compliance. issue wearing mask politicized.  Catching 100% cases enter good idea theory, really need perfection make system work well. Seems like masks, tracing, targeted testing great job there's small outbreak isolate cases. go 1 100,000 overnight addressed seems like flame out. Like little, controlled fires burn whole forest. Wonderful! environment needs people living even longer… Let's see here, lines packed hours testing sites open, positivity rates going up. Hmmmm....what here. Let's Shut testing numbers go down.  really hate guy. Time beer makes sense, reason we're letting Americans Canada (or anyone else currently, especially Americans), followed lockdown played fair, never really still one highest rates activity entire world, hell would open insanity?! 

I imagine Sweden's neighbors feel way them. fair? maybe brought inaction needed, 'deserve' (by mean cut neighbors entirely, covid...no one deserves obviously) actually calling 45 day quarantine aside one reddit user?  Oh yeah remember 100% failure rate!! 

What even mean “100% failure rate” care explain?  right way handle ask yo leave call police report trespasser. missed infections also missed deaths due covid, can't take official number deaths divide one estimate. take (2) 2000 IU pills. Done.  Agreed. doctors see Trump press conferences, forget training lose capacity critical thought, stop prescribing drugs patients. Trump says HCQ might work, means doctors must prescribe HCQ. Because. 

It makes total sense. I'm difficulty bypassing auto mod certain topics, I'm going give trying reply, lol. pretty big news. saw similar study Minnesota scale like shows doesn’t spread easily outdoors. man, sometimes big numbers go right head they're hard visualize put terms 85 hospitals.. thats yikes sure came first chicken egg? donate platelets also. Platelet donations require long waiting period also receive antibody test come Utah, mask site outside capitol. guess trolling looks like.

 **The number includes least two Secret Service officers detailed event tested positive virus rally began Saturday evening.** 

from article posted. go say again..........there reportage blah blah blah

&amp;#x200B;

no wait think mom calling fish fingers jello drug dealers tons cases police departments seizing houses property people who’s teenager sold someone dime bag weed house car. treatment reduces death rate even desirable saved treatment left permanently disabled? individual's perspective life probably preferable, society's perspective - would still shelter, feed, clothe people.

What's greater disaster? virus killing one every hundred people, placing additional 2-3 every 100 permanent disability? SARS MERS left 1/3-1/2 survivors chronic fatigue syndrome... Similar, different thing.

Targeting specific state(s) different blanket restriction.  opportunity inform better, double ignorance. 

The choice yours. study based doctor's visit's flu like symptoms could people going doctor allergies sinus infections.....it's antibody test.

Every antibody test that's done worldwide even areas hit hard Covid show results close herd immunity. Even Sweden less 8%.

I know ""it's spreading undetected large numbers"" narrative keeps getting pushed evidence support it. I'll interested read whatever find. know immigrants families live small towns. seems like bad that's anecdotal zero context anything hear  mean like basically every country high rate infections brought minimum......because temporary closures. odd spot live Vermont work 15 miles away NH medical center. cross border every day really choice say *za przeproszeniem* it’s dead Pre-peak: “FLATTEN CURVE” 
Post-peak: “CURVE FLAT RECOVERY SLOW” did, actually. Germany loosened distancing regulations due low infection rates. believe state allowed gatherings 50 people held outside (don't quote though). think part problem given way country treated lot poor people bait-and-switch, empty promises votes, wage theft, surprising people believe follow actually giving 10 million last day; could decide that's expensive pay out, vs. 1 million guaranteed right now. Also pay everyone's else's bullshit defecits lol Changes July 1. first wave end???  earth would enforce this? developed country world folks! Right here. /s

What shithole . Never really any.  It’s huge street market cloth masks used daily people commute work. work mask anytime outside due pollution. Strange world games China shut factory production air quality skyrocketed. Taiwan amazing independent country countries need support learn from. moved SARS leaned lot did. I’ve masks since January still Covid free far. Cautious optimism. shows results, vaccine.

Also, Bolsanaro fully responsible fact Brazil insane infection rate. let forget that, Brazilians. Let's inject sun rays ourselves! great find tests.

I've wondering government tie stimulus getting test lol think haven’t hit peak deaths yet? Check abundant coronavirus resources? I’m also happy American response you’re purposefully putting head sand don’t realize deaths trending now. Yea... going well. traveling Actually, no. COVID friendly ways gyms remain open, including cubicles around equipment well limited capacity. 

I hate sharing Fox News articles, here’s pretty neat article something gyms increase safety. mean, put shoes average American gets information whatever news station watch every evening. hearing case counts death numbers every day supposed big scary emergency, suddenly news like ""yo dudes smashed windows downtown torched cop car protests cop dick"", clear sign emergency important. liberal americans like beeing associated us deny it. somehow think make less trustworthy beeing associated US. stay hotel sign health waiver involves certain conditions. flew plane already failed conditions. facing anxiety, chronic fatigue 

Ok sounds psychological years

... virus existed humans half year. can’t possibly know this.

I question source. New York barely started outside dining phase reopening honest US

I taking seriously sentence. fuck mean US accurate reports? Trump literally said something lines ""the lesser people tested, lesser cases reported."" quarentine Canada sent Mounties check apartment. point becomes criminal - right? worries brother. I’m covered. Screw employer, they’re acted horribly. I’m thankful work great one reprimanded people going office without prior permission. need take training course sign papers stating symptoms, haven’t travelled state interacted anyone outside household they’ll even consider letting go office. okay, whatever floats boat. 

my point still stands - least he’s trying something. he’s perfect he’s trying. doesn’t change anything fatality rate. already knew serology studies official test numbers grossly counted actual number infections. r/murderedbywords I'm sincerely asking this, someone lived SoFla 30+ years worked news industry there.

Do think Florida reporting COVID19 deaths honestly? Rhode island targeting New Yorkers. gotta protect neck. fucked early response boasted twitter ""puts people money"". if, man sacrificed thousands lives keep wall street happy. 2.5% participants ""fair"" amount spread now? It’s shame certain sub-reddit think guy attention power, good country... Done real well sweeping covid deaths rug pnumonia deaths. 5x+ times average amount pnumonia deaths totally normal didn't, sure demanded dictator life number terms prior. Yeah paddling.... anyone died there

You talking China? Cause lol. much, much, much worse. absolutely fucking should.. especially progress state made hit hard. Yehp.

Watch happen today. know BNO comes back bad. remember people reporting Jan/Feb disappeared. why.....wait it.....we learn live virus put eggs vaccine basket. 

Which means....wait it....living life normal, understanding risk part it. saying normally correct, certain cytokines (there many different kinds, cause damaging inflammation) attack blood vessels heart, liver, kidney, lungs, etc. 

The cytokine Interleukin-6 10 isolated root cause behind damaging inflammation. Patients given Tocilizumab saw marked immediate improvement, especially patients experiencing ARDS Cytokine Storm. theory steroids antivirals similar effect (normally), saw opposite. either medicines harder process overtax already failing organs. administer Tocilizumab early enough, completely shutting immune system one specific reaction damaging case covid-19. conventional treatment, conventional pathogen. hope helps clarify simply. Seems right choice guess speculation point Lock state keep residents instate!  hand, got guilds items drop, ""loot council"" 2-3 people chat second figure best person give item to, that's it.

Pretty much done I'd play EverQuest. People would message interested something they'd pick best fit move 

A point system would drive crazy lol Thx! agree. press would accomplish two goals:

1. would help left-leaning individuals know talking points trust, appeasement strategies.
2. would likely make Trump trust more, seeing ""fake news media"" calling defending Trump. extra trust would give Fauci leeway. dude old testament Actually Asian white households fastest growing multi-generational households. one fastest growing Asian populations Let guess; self proclaimed conservative. like book learnin scientist tell reality is. got complete lack experience, education, intelligence guide that's liked it. 

If anyone else comes along tells something causes feel bad, let bad feels turn words tumble hole face. saves think, thankful never good anyway. Wow. Incredibly racist Xenophobic. them, would keep border closed us require covid-19 test upon arrival. Wonder Canada sure excluded given progress since close USA. Really afraid Trump start pressuring extend closure current mid/end July date. would likely lead resignation monarchy. live tourist town. people visiting entire lockdown. Fuck asshat New Jersey drove 6 hours ""just go eat get hair cut"". little late. Jesus Chist New Jersey strict mask rules NY state does. numbers good governor's ego comes state's residents let obvious dislike Trump stop going kiss ring discuss needs New Jerseyans. 

Oh, New Jersey also continuing UE feel work place unsafe. I'll SHOCKED Cuomo everything get people back offices commercial real estate crater, continously blames restaurants places outbreaks probably started trains, buses, offices. course restaurants bars giant hazard, important NYC, home ons busy body middle management types unnecessary real work done home, gets people back offices makes believe safe. get tested yet. sick shit flu like symptoms hell cough middle march San Diego got stay home orders. never fever didnt worry it. take antibody test. time, wife 2 daughters fine entire time absolutely would gotten sick call well crafted political statement. well versed. Polls show lot recognize horribly this. You’re right 60% approval rating handling pandemic absurd, that’s group usually 98-99% approval endless incompetence. roughly 40 point drop represents massive return reality among many followers. plenty young people discernable complicating health factors died experienced significant morbidity disease. plenty people health conditions developed fault own. imaginary conflict ""perfectly healthy people"" ""people take care themselves,"" novel respiratory viral disease. think masks saw staff bars, hanging around neck random people walking street didn’t read this?

Lots studies show 2 meters isnt really far enough chosen practical limit keeping things going shops etc. Lockdown reason numbers went social distancing masks would way keep numbers things longer thing.... see going go? 

You realise reason numbers went exponentially beginning distancing, right? Stopping distancing early stage bad idea.

Don't make assumptions think 'celebrating' second wave, guy. We're going get second wave regardless one country wants wear face covering socially distance more. people called us DOoMeRs?? surprised? Lol...

Seriously guys read President made comment, multiple White House officials asserted President Trump different story, telling reporter **though never gave order slow testing**, really tell people United States would look better fewer coronavirus tests performed.

Trump always said testing makes us look bad find cases, outside making fun media claiming said slow testing, Trump never said suggested told anyone slow testing.

But keep pushing misinformation hoping people read headlines Yet keep seeing “masks nothing” Honestly lots people seriously struggled depression anxiety soild since lots experience dealing managing sympyoms. least feels like rest world finally feeling feel often actually kinda reassuring interesting watch Absolutely.

That's great analogy. Disclaimer: following tennis past 2 years, almost stuff looked past.

**TLDR**; Djokovic first became world No. 1 2011, 3 4 grand slams, beat Federer Nadal multiple times throughout year. course 2010s decade, would reign supreme around half it.

Federer reigned supreme World No. 1 2004-2008 record 237 consecutive weeks. ceded No. 1 ranking loss Nadal Wimbledon 2008 Final, widely considered best match history. time, Federer's loss signaled changing guard, passing torch next generation. Indeed, past 2 years, Federer would always beat Nadal grass (Wimbledon), Nadal would always beat Federer clay (French Open). considered kings respective surfaces. Nadal finally usurp Federer favorite surface announced world beginning era. However, Federer able regain form part following year, World no. 1 ranking went back forth two 2011.

For multiple years, Djokovic stuck No. 3 ranking, unable break Federer-Nadal dominance. changed 2011 3 4 grandslams, defeated Federer Nadal multiple occasions, 41 matches consecutively (which interestingly started loss Federer ended loss Federer). remained dominant half 2010's decade, consecutively. would win 16 17 Grandslam titles time. Federer 15 20 Grandslam titles 2000's decade (16 titles, consider decade 2001 2010). such, Federer considered King 2000s, Djokovic could also considered king 2010's.

Nadal never truly dominated era way Federer Djokovic did. Instead, could considered consistent rival respective No. 1's, achievements evenly spread across decades. now, Federer 310 weeks No. 1, Djokovic 282 weeks, Nadal 209 weeks. terms grandslams, currently, Federer 20, Nadal 19, Djokovic 17. allowing anxiety added list side effects vs persons reaction could used trigger outside issues. covid? Sorry. cant hired position. covid? Sorry. need put gun rights hold now. covid? Sorry. need drop life insurance policy. 

Keeping true mental health issue separate important treated properly. Lumping anxiety mental health ""psychological disturbance"" actual side effect improper use term. hour ago, earthquake struck Mexico City, thousands, maybe millions people rushed street. 2020 bad joke Cuomo good mkay Im sure that, everything seen contagious. Cost. hospital believed potential tocilizumab beginning, enough give ICU patients. plenty patients ICU could characterize cytokine storm, prioritize. country reopened bars restaurants many businesses 1 meter distance rule (think relevant UK redditors now) may 18th. What's even fucked vendors show even know safe! vendors told comic con going happen comic con people's. show black listed allowed attend future events :( prince careful? Wtf know me?:o rock living under? New York New Jersey kicked ass. states like Arizona Oklahoma getting schlonged hardest. I'm supposed fly Maine (from AZ) mid July. I've tickets ~year now. *don't* want make hassle anyone, i'm going middle BFE, Aroostock county.

What would advise? scrap it? say stupid shit without knowing talking about?

/smh Right that's practically useless compare cases. hospitalizations better comparison. harder compare data.

Still, NY hospitalization peaked almost 10 per 10,000 residents. deaths peaked almost 1000 per day.

Arizona getting close hospitalizations 3 per 10,000 hospitalizations they're barely 25 deaths per day.

I know there's lag crossed 1/10th NY's hospitalization peak month ago they're still even close 1/10th NY's peak deaths. sub disallows text posts reason. posted private subreddit printscreened there. aprrently text posts also disallowed. pastebin.

Give suitable subreddit repost like it. believe since comment posted, said kidding wanting slow testing...
So definitely great, worst could done. People autoimmune disorders increased risk catching infectious diseases, worse severity. People taking biologics, whose immune system even compromised, less likely hospitalized - biologics prevent cytokine storms.

There's research specific risk infection groups, there's reason assume worse healthy individuals, taking biologic reduces hospitalization it. know causing myriad clinical manifestations. theorized mode infection might drive that.

We know virus spread terms infected infection occurred. I'm SC majority stores signs ask wear mask, enforced them. order many people store lifted, certain stores still count keep eye number customers inside. 

Most stores crowded like holidays, least weekends. Lots tourists state country.  Makes wonder second stimulus check one told about, lol.

Target still seems keeping eye lines crowds distancing, employees masked someone door sanitizes carts. 

I go walmart says masks enforced. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seen much herd immunity anywhere prove working well enough still better slow spread. States hospital capacity near full capacity good thing. Worth noting peak 4000 ICU 1000 lombardy alone. I'm aware prize. mention work 1970s, however. awarded far later been.

We put old tribal knowledge ringer science. that's exactly happened... 50 years ago.

The applies ayurvedic medicine humorism. Lol mad called pea brained doubt result would 50%, agree premise: let perfection stop getting good enough. 

* Wide spread wearing masks stop spread, slows it.
* Social distancing stop spread, slows it.
* Limiting gatherings &lt; 50 people stop spread, slows it. 
* Isolating travelers stop spread, slows it. 
* Temperature checks stop spread, slows it.

3. Completely missing point. People talking communities taking responsibility small non violent offenders, like calling people picking shit, setting fireworks following rules would want police officer gun turning handle. 

Again, I’m talking city it’s far densely populated holiday areas like Jersey shore Hamptons much easier know people local area not.

If approaching somebody asking town even general chit chat kind way much observing people recognise local area reporting potential breaking rules would help ease burden police potential quarantine.

OH sweet summer child...

Make mistake it. police protect serve *the law*. *you*, law order society itself. 

Once figure you’ll start understand world little better. dish can't take it, eh? Upvote pride. No, I’m downplaying severity disease. I’m simply saying testing people would originally been, show median age cases decrease age. Regardless symptoms, mortality rate younger adults lower. Therefore overall mortality identified cases would decrease. amount is, isn’t known reduction. great idea definitely unconstitutional another person without one too, pass? Deaths increase cases indicates expect increase 3 4 weeks. FDA also watered regulations hand sanitizer februrary people countries ones suffering leader's egos ignorance It’s predicted save 1 8 people "" told I'm hurting family ""being afraid"" ""

Tell killing family afraid worry much. Masks perfect, none us perfect wearing them. can't always immediately wash hands removing mask, every time touch mask adjust it. everyone conscientious you, we'd Italy (200 cases per day) USA (23k cases per day). Yep. Holy *shit* Arizona's bad time. sisters workplace, hospital even allow wears masks (not even ones employees paid themselves) cdc decided recommend wearing masks. news articles, would say happened lot many hospitals many states.

So goal, completely failed. think something unsaid probably trump desire keep downplaying virus. would bet made difference recommendations too. Good Luck guys !

sending love Pakistan 💝 care many asymptomatic people it.

What thoroughly stupid statement. large percentage asymptomatic carriers lung lesions damage respiratory system. 

It's clear idea dealing here. Meanwhile: Denmark has:

-	603 deaths
-	12k total infected (4.2% deathrate)
-	32 hospitalized
-	Have required/reccomended masks public.

We must lucky. wonder tourism US also prohibited discouraged. would impact areas fairly severely think person meant ""the positive effects country"", ""for Fauci's job security."" what’s bad government allowing people save providing living wage? learning code free online programs able find better jobs pandemic over? think government put much bailing billionaires militarizing abusive police force, paying citizens time national crisis priority. mention one developed countries level wealth still doesn’t universal healthcare. Unfortunately way things always seem go businesses hold saying anything last possible minute hopes things miraculously turn around still open. sudden, announce one day they're shutting down/staying closed. Wow pretty well done short story. questions raises raise progresses. Would fit well read animal farm 1984 high school. I'd say cant believe I've never heard author before, went school america 🙄 dont really learn anything. reason ever read 1984 AF independent lit class list 500 books read 3000 pages get A. can't guarantee it, reduce risk.

If never get vaccine, inevitable everybody get it. almost everybody.

I could imagine eating inside restaurant right now, getting plane. enter 3 buildings: home, private office, store. go store per month, that's figured curbside pickup prescription medication. car home humans except gf. then, course, usual distancing, mask use, sanitizer, constant hand washing, etc.

These certainly stronger precautions people taking. Half friends yukking bars moment - masks. think that, compared most, significantly reduced risk...but nonzero. may good odds, every time leave home I'm testing those.

My hope keeping risk-reduction measures one two things. First, vaccine ever, likely catch thing point. longer delay infection, better medical establishment treating (I hope). But, course, bigger wish delay infection vaccine found.

I'm *hopeful*, stupid. measures hardly burdensome, keep indefinitely. fact, much prefer curbside pickup groceries. I'm decreasing odds I'll catch coronavirus, certainly guaranteeing it. could symptomless case right now, fact.

The truly fucked thing, probably mantra sub, could cream coronavirus everybody I, probably people, sub do.

edit: typo  load (censored)! norwegian agree actions done politicians Sweden, swedes great neighboors see reason look them. hope borders closed thing control pariah? chance. Great neighboors luck, thats Yup. way outbreak hoarding disorder amongst former children Great Depression.

We could avoid proactive funding trauma disorder treatment, know far even 20 years ago, let alone 100. course, won't, reasons. \*sigh\* anyone hasn’t seen video, link forget Grigor Dimitrov (former #3, US Open SF ‘19) Borna Coric tested positive. Alexandr Zverev (Australian Open SF top 10 player) Dominic Thiem (current #3, current Australian Open French Open finalist) test negative. Wondering Jelena Jankovic (former women’s world #1 former US Open finalist). problems voluntary surveys noted.

But there's little literature long-term outcomes, except [case CT confirmed serious lung damage non-hospitalized patients Dr. Frank Hartig.

I suspect significant fraction survivors persistent post-Covid-19 lung and/or kidney dysfunction. 

I'd much like see 1/3/6/12-month followup study representative sample symptomatic patients, including CT imaging, lung kidney function. opening up, masked. Summer camps happening, restaurants open, etc. ...are people still willingly travelling New York? fair, time, shortage masks, health care workers got first priority, Fauci cut off, saying enough masks, people try wear them. Solution - open park every two weeks, keep everyone locked two week period resetting next group. Leave ton food, prop costumes various places people take pictures, leave rides attendees figure themselves. Let employees stay home. work eventually

/s obviously yeah imagine going anytime soon. Hopefully safe 5-7 years children old enough enjoy it. Speaking resident, people tend get dirty looks outright shamed wearing mask public. Governor Baker also taken thing incredibly serious, super transparent numbers threats since beginning well unrolling very, careful phased reopening plan. 

I suspect states Northeast well thing moment, we’ve seen first hand bad get. Watching things south like watching unfolding horror movie. Immunity actually develops critical period first years (I think maybe age 7). time immune system evolves show immune response several antigens later life. 

There actually many people work animals fact develop allergic reactions animals increased exposure. too, im currently Covid. plan never seeing another person maybe won't. Thank you, sadly live area can't get tested unless traveling respiratory symptoms :/ insane Disney World wants reopen weeks. They've closed since mid-March Florida experienced 600-800 cases per day positive tests rates around 3%. 

Now state experiencing massive surge 3k+ cases per day positivity rates around 10%...and want open? makes zero sense, especially Florida's entire reopening phase progression predicated declining amount cases. situation going complete opposite direction reopening guidelines yet none seem care. insane. 

The optics forcing opening like amid surge cases terrible. People dying high rates anymore people longer scared Well, mean praised also condemned them. knows hell goes head. time takes positions sees one sticks. South Carolina trying provide researchers huge sample size proper vaccine trial

/s There's thing free. testing sites far I'm aware require physician's referral arranged employers. Visiting physician get referral certainly free. step process may cost extra, either someone paying (employers) paid significant money upstream privilege tested. Oh, Thank you.

I thought tested required test matter came from... welp, is. well, that's excuse many people administration ended enabling trump horrible things spoke longer administration. can't lie asked slow testing boss talk you. Trump go around Fauci ask others slow testing, thing purposefully slow testing down. liable kid gets sick? sign waiver suing? Paywall dont work dont eat. America hard work. studies handling Spanish Flu pandemic showed locking population center 3 days earlier results thousands less cases. Imagine couple weeks ahead!

Don’t get wrong - want vaccine ASAP! curious. I'm finding hard go near peoples poo, I'm sure hold wee bit longer. Place. Literally one place. One tiny place. it. strawman fucking quote me.

Honestly, want see systematic prosecution everyone who, criminally, supported president, companies owns. would love see live presidential stipend friends assets largely bankrupted family members scramble distance themselves.

Steve Guess gets slammed laws assume police enforce good faith.

Answer: Putting bunch vague unenforceable laws books great way fuck minorities. Minorities (along anyone else respecting authoritah properly) get letter law. Everyone else gets spirit law. people little lockdown, treat data multigenerational families one roof Texas Arizona? Plenty people come NYC via trains. Fir enough. “Sorry, broken ribs car accident wait, Karen got Corona retirement party Golden Corral last week. Try calling children’s hospital, told tiny beds left.” actually causing anxiety trying remedy drinking!

Took forever figure out! Holding cloth mouth like trying keep mosquitos chain-link fence.

I think lot people failing appreciate this. work gives clothes masks employees. thin undershirt material. see light right them. reduce spread? Yeah, probably some. Maybe would reduce viral load think mask like prevents virus moving back forth probably understand small viruses droplets are. saying can't herd immunity bacterial two separate statements? still develop long lasting immunity bacteria there's theoretical reason get herd immunity I'm bay area, first lock nation. state followed close behind.

Everything coming gov rational, science based focused stopping spread. Untill Trump famous call governor's. feds basically starved states left alternative opening. Despite every health official recommend opposite.. Wow. looks like younger people really driving surge. Europe introduced mandatory face masks RCT studies anywhere show protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections. 

The issue face masks driven purely politics science. assume sarcasm. One never knows sub. Soooo like lockdown something.....? governor said, however, Texas would remain open business, emphasizing need residents wear masks, wash hands maintain social distancing stop spread virus.

So, basically nothing going change. Great job, leadership! Good luck finding country ""better"" Closest thing would neck gaitor type thing/wearing scarf wraps around half face. likely work, one's ears tend still exposed. NZ democracy, mandatory 14 day isolation anyone coming nation. 

Government run, admin military (as last week) 

Testing done Day 3 Day 12. done typically takes two days reach NZ. must negative test result upon leaving. 

Australia stricter system you’re even allowed hotel room duration. 

The rules explicitly clear, everyone knows exactly allowed NZ. currently citizens, visa holders, families allowed travel NZ. 

There exceptions, Avatar 2 production arrived three weeks ago finished quarantine, begin filming now. TV/ movie productions way. positivity rate Massachusts around 2.4 percent according Johns Hopkins: means protesters significantly likely test positive covid compared others tested.  think seriously reconsider whether need service. Especially one emerging hotspots. Politics damned, protecting yourself. countries go lockdown beginning dont think proactive testing going on. know part world we're talking about, right? Without electoral college gov would ran way Reddit. Burying unpopular opinions marginalizing minority populations. good idea imo. sarcasm assuming either. reasoning Trump due fact middle America feels abandoned due outsourcing globalization policies. people deserve voice.

Russia, virus catch you! sad many places burn learn... Came say this, to. +1 Need go out, like lock need go out. still go work need go out?

He’s essentially telling everyone stay away restaurants, entertainment venues, stores. say like poster state fact.

Which isnt actually ""fact"" there.

""I trust Steve Disney World."" What's fact there?

Their might presumed facts, actual facts. Another baseless narrative. states, hell, countries, relocating people infected covid-19 elder care facilities hospitals? Afaik, none. Elder care facilities expected able manage outbreaks. 

When hospital space highly limited, patients longer needing hospital care sent home finish quarantine. case elder care facilities, introducing virus there, b/c person got infected first place. 

And like cuomo said, facility wanting take back could ask state place somewhere else permanent basis. afaik, none asked that. What's unbelievable disordered thinking... FL benefit learning NY. allowed situation grow control. I’m really starting give hope path forward America besides herd immunity. number people still think masks conspiracy theory make sick astounding. American people distrusting rally together something like this. people get board containment measures others double conspiracy theories accuse board “drinking kool-aid” 🤦‍♀️ I'd say urgency extra high, McConnell spending time appointing Conservative judges.

It's much Reid excuse, Mitch excuse whatsoever given circumstances. Bringing Reid pointless. slashed chinas cdc fact. W.H.O even took fucking United States getting bigger Itally W.H.O go know it’s good idea everyone wears mask won’t happen. 

What don’t understand. W.H.O funded United Sates nothing. 

CDC China what? Fuck time line virus. Great tell started we’ll talk. 

All shit paying fucking nothing. Nada. 

W.H.O nothing 

CDC China. good boss. 

Wuhan fucking welding people houses. said Nagh it’s cold. 

I hate trump that’s past outbreak nothing done. 

What done right fucking now? 

Yeh ok Lung Scar State He’s law LAW. executive branch basically law enforcement, Trump figured key corrupting all. Since yesterday say told time time isn’t real America fox despite headquarters here. 

Move HQ “real America” like Oklahoma 

Sorry rational Oklahomins(?) Okies(?) HEPA filters filter viral particles reasonably priced. made HVAC systems. 

I one place I'd dust less breathe less smog, got second one case neighbors sick. Hopefully gets Also, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis (just throw cities Northeast). fucking too. Agreed testing would good requirement travel also enforce that?

If people driving know tested?

Licence plates could reveal traveled state, continued travel around New York quarantine decided required. 

Hell track pings cell phone towers well back person came state, wouldn’t prove quarantine broken unless went far away staying could still show came from.

Even threat fine breaking quarantine could help deter people travelling up. 

‘A local renting car might plates another state’ - legit confused could explain better. car rental companies need plates state operate in? Hamptons would try enforce quarantines, thousands NYC residents went country homes often violation stay home orders essential travel, height NYC style wealthy hypocrisy. Honor system Maine basically. 14-day quarantine (can still go necessities barely quarantine) sign piece paper states negative test last 72 hours arriving Maine. Police willing/capable enforcement. population smaller New Jersey state be, let's see...#42 50 land area.

Much like Iceland, New Zealand, Australia (practically speaking) island closed borders. position countries 70x population, 200x land area, Donald Trump president.

So keep yourselves, Danes. haircuts!!! one.  necessarily, no. Automatic weapons awful anything suppressing fire, pretty much every rifleman military trained use precision, single-shot fire. much effective using precise, rapid single shots.

Take note hundreds stories years someone drive-by illegally-modified machine pistol hitting fuck-all. I, bookstore worker, shame people wear mask nose without getting call hr? Intensely staring works quarter time asked pull back move on. true, lucky far, need careful spread others risk. Right, would criminal. drugs drugs? edit Fauci's name cause spelling, dude seek help wtf wrong Well, case Dr. Fauci actively contradicts Trump. thing extremely careful so. Medical experts imploring people wear masks months. basic science enough % people wear masks, effective R0 drops 1, die nature. 

Because people that, north america go lockdown. Lockdown necessary, wrecks havoc economy causes unrest. Many asian countries need lockdown everyone got board wearing mask.

It's singlest effective easiest thing society do. message needs pushed harder every level government. possible second lockdown one wants that. investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel (2019-nCoV) identified 
📷.

I would say strongly leans towards positively asserting h2h doesnt exist That's trauma works.

First all, lot soldiers came back horrific trauma disorders, wound abusing children psychotic rages. like ""ok."" There's entire body research badly fucked Western society failing support traumatized people wars. still huge swaths society suffering aftermaths multi-generational abuse began traumatized people wars.

And secondly, trauma disorders caused events. human go traumatic event come without trauma appropriate kinesthetic mental interconnection community. people 1945 today. Today, record-setting numbers people live totally isolated lives without close relationships -- even quarantine.

It's entirely natural people low threshold development trauma also low level human interconnection. That's literally cause trauma disorders.

But also, let's keep mind quarter children experience trauma already, because, again, we're still really fucked failing properly address trauma back wars. article says, worst issues seen children also living poverty, food insecurity, abuse. make sense. always wondered many “asymptomatic” people mild symptoms, think allergies something. report symptoms aren’t counted symptomatic symptoms don’t meet official definition. Or, conversely, symptoms “symptomatic” people might unrelated cause. Swedes also able travel even countries slowly opening borders. Nobody wants accept high risk visitor. Look recent imported cases New Zealand Devil's advocate. Memorial day month ago seen spike deaths that. riots protests 3 weeks ago right? Still huge climb deaths that. Overall, plummets due North East able control reduce hospitalization sharply, right South, hospitalization skyrocketing every day hospital 2 3 weeks away getting overwhelmed. hate parroting, going take 2 3 weeks red show, might reaching NY level, might reach MI, MA, CT, NJ level. Oh agree, *very* good sign activity low right now. think totally safe say we're woods yet. Esp. way exponential function works: *gut* feeling MN, Norway Denmark *not* see big explosion week 4-6 result large demos. theory possible scientific background think early discount possibility. lean towards ""this'll fine, dodged bullet"" think important remain open notion might turn around. Holy shit, 3k less yearly property tax house. New Yorker's brought country ""escaped""... math wrong, agree premise.


Edit clarify “math wrong” part see another person said something similar meant something issuing quarantine means 25% people follow 25% decide travel here, reduced state spread 50%.

If 25% (25 100) follow NY, 25% (25 100) don’t travel NY, 50 200 don’t travel states, 25%, 50%.

That said, wouldn’t underestimate importance people give following rules orders even unenforced. ""No one drives New York, there's much traffic"" Easily ignorant comment I’ve read month. Thanks laugh! standard ever prove lying liar contradicts themselves, rather contradicting known facts.

And I'm asking provide statements, present facts would absolutely known time offending big strawman. respond actually said comment, instead imagined saying?

...what? strawman? said lying likely explanation. I'm asking explain assume case, versus possible telling something known scientifically somehow known top scientists

Where say totally wrong say known general public

Stuff ""known general public"" place public policy, I'm trying convey. kinds misinformation gets repeated ad naseum, especially communities like this, develops force behind it. common opinion make something scientific many mainstream articles, would say general public know?

Mainstream news articles notoriously bad presenting science. mainstream public even worse reading said articles understanding said science. air spreading enclosed spaces public transportation non-issue, would healthcare workers need masks badly? Contradiction.

1. Healthcare workers know use masks properly, especially things like N95s. fit tested trained, know use N95, really better surgical mask (which overly protective).

2. Healthcare workers exposed far higher numbers infected patients.

3. Healthcare workers exposed conditions exacerbating spread, intubations creating aerosols. 

Healthcare workers general populace exposure virus, thus require PPE. complete misunderstanding situation. required period strict quarantine (e.g., JFK) two weeks. fact NYC locked 45 days irrelevant, unless view quarantine primarily way dominate punish outsiders. Novak believes waterbending??? I'm sure energy discuss you, though I'm willing try. Americans fly Iceland then. would cheaper them. always amazing seeing people try argue since stop gun deaths, stopped them.

OK, well seat belts save everyone involved car crash, better get rid too. Yup. China's one country lockdowns right.

They're strict. Quarantine mean ""except walks, takeout, groceries etc."". literally stay inside away non quarantined people. exceptions. Yes, I'm making political conversation. I'm using within context super-spreaders:

80/20 phenomenon recurs much human biological behaviour. (20% diseases cause 80% prescriptions). I’m fine that, Vermonter would pretty cool NYers coming state quarantined too. signs everywhere It’s unenforceable unless live island restrict access easily. Sounds good say though. harm found people prednisone, IIRC. fascinating, found another steroid helpful. Modern journalism exercise committing logical fallacies. Mask policy California super odd practice (at least governor trying). go restaurant, waiting table outside strangers, must wear mask. walk in, ask keep mask on. sit, one empty chair away next person, staff let know remove mask. Proceed eat entire meal maskless three feet away nearest stranger. certainly people/institutions profiting mass illness, don’t think it’s Fauci 😂 really outrageous point. 

DisneyWorld needs open international ,muliti generational family trips local gym needs stay closed.

its really getting annoying lottery allowed open whats not. title extremely misleading. say ""the European CDC data obviously issue countries"" title much suggests particular Sweden.

I singled Sweden there's much media talk Sweden approached differed significantly countries. thread response media coverage month ago Sweden highest 7-day rolling death rate world basis claim tenuous. rolling average, thus wrong...the REAL numbers source (that examined methodology all).""

No, wrong rolling average, European CDC base daily deaths number deaths *reported* day, incorrect way going it, deaths reported *occurred* days prior *reported* on. Swedish Public Health Agency constantly updates numbers deaths reported. also removes deaths various reasons ended there. European CDC clearly system.

The consequences that, today's death toll reflects fraction people died last month so, reflect many died *today*, means curve shifted towards later dates. look FHM's data today 2 deaths today, look week likely roughly 15, 2-4 weeks could around 20-40, 23rd june. Meanwhile, European CDC reported 69 deaths today, includes 67 cases gotten dates today, occurred mostly last week so. European CDC data accurate, means almost one dies weekends, 70 people dies weekdays, that's number based approach approach, wrong, news narratives based wrong.

The FHM data accurate data could get, responsible government agency collect create statistic Sweden, European CDC gets data FHM. primary source Finally, last line gives game away. ""Conclusion: skeptical news articles, try find primary data possible, careful comparing statistics different countries."" kind dressed whole thing like academic paper kind, much long-ish reddit post clear agenda (ironic accuse others bias within it).

I try scientific skeptical approach even private life, way try sell academic paper. agenda bring attention media skeptical enough investigated data reporting errors make conclusion media impossible draw based quality data. pointed news articles first emerged, full data available proper comparison, that's post 1 month really in-depth analysis different methodologies number collecting

Because there's need mentioned factors make numbers fuzzier (reporting delays, 7-day averaging), declare another source ""The real numbers.""

Reporting delays thing that's important here. [When compare European CDC data FHM calculated 7 day rolling average. FHM data primary data European CDC, 'real' data Needs serious explanation because, logically speaking, final clause follow prior two. displacement right, mean less severe appears, earlier.

If train breaking, speed indicator shows velocity 2 seconds ago, going show speed higher actually is. Likewise declining death rate, shift towards later dates mean given date, death rate seems higher actually is, evidenced comparison. mean florida already requires ny quarantine two weeks shitty handling whole thing Dont know. Everyone obeyed mask suggestion CDC, people businesses obeyed 6ft social distancing rules perfectly, we've abundance testing, everyone made sweeping changes life support higher attention hand washing cleanliness. also cancelled church gatherings political rallies, one even protested stay home order. shouldnt increase all, dont get it. 
 
/hella sarcasm. Please stop spreading misinformation. FINALLY HAPPENING. Hopefully states follow suit. read word I've written. believe every study see, especially one pushing group think shaming compliance What’s corona bro? Also I’m uk doesn’t seem football going alas. times I've out, servers wearing properly. Ya lied every one protect Europe figured out, Asia has, NYC has

The response varies greatly Asian countries. South Asia shows signs slowing anytime soon. like think that. numbers hitting news folks responding “don’t attack liberty” Given COVID spreading like wildfire Brazil, shouldn’t take long see well works not. importantly 17k relevant too. That's reports useless click bait. would kiss man could. terrible numbers high, least one good thing came (Arizona) cities *finally* mandated masks days ago. obviously going take time mandatory masks catch hopefully start putting dent numbers, seriously feels good finally something try stop instead watching numbers keep climbing saying ""well hey thats life, learn live it"".  
 
It's complete 180 terms people wearing masks compared week ago. used go store see maybe 10% people wearing masks. feels like almost 100%. went gas station day guy tried come without one clerk immediately said ""Sir, can't come store without mask on"". awesome almost wanted cry. I'm seriously considering making switch. No. I'm referring vital liberty known ""freedom  Florida Florida Man USA. Killing black grandparents parents black lives matter ironic. sad ironic. Yeah I've got friend remote working drawn sober breath since March. 

Giving real thought going credit fact I'm locked wife. support system available 24 hours day much different times I've tried quit drinking. 

Plus I'm experiencing much less frustration daily life used quarantine. I'm fortunate enough work home that's wonderful. deal shitty coworkers traffic more. I'm hungry eat I'm sleepy sleep. guess suffer unfulfilled needs way society working normally lol

I honestly hope quarantine never ends. Florida similar order tri state analyzed data 9,358 patients younger 50 years COVID-19 Jan. 20 April 24 included COVID-19 Research Network database 37 global health care organizations, 36% United patients study, 33.2% hospitalized severe COVID-19 ischemic stroke occurred 0.7% patients. Compared patients without ischemic stroke, likely older (39.3 years vs. 36.7 years; P &lt; .001), although similar proportion women (60.9% vs. 60.4%; P = .93). addition, patients ischemic stroke higher prevalence comorbidities including diabetes (32.8% vs. 6.5%), hypertension (61% vs. 11.7%), HF (15.6% vs. 1.5%), obesity (46.9% vs. 17.4%) prior history stroke (28.1% vs. conducted median 16.5 days stroke 36.5 days without stroke. follow-up, all-cause mortality occurred 15.6% patients acute ischemic stroke compared 0.6% without stroke. Although sad many feel largely preventable; hope mortality rate among newer cases lower seen historically.

As cases spread first states highly concentrated nursing homes (a high risk population). Current spread although regrettable seems hitting different demographic (younger) hopefully lagged death rates remain high. Yeah, parents ate cake, freedom regression live something similar europeans took diseases americas natives genetic immunity against. 

Lovely times. supposed be. different set expectations? Many US states aren’t peak yet asynptomatic cases clearly causing infections lead hospitalizations may misunderstood meant, delete that’s case. mean “follow it” “don’t travel here”, reading first one opposite “travel here”, meaning traveling NY. They've given already ready bloodgates open Secondly, hope agree scars would bet agree.

Well kids great limited restrictions under, resilient. would also resilient grandparent died, clearly would affect more. Obviously, know kids (if any), speaking general terms. hope kids OK. people feel ‘rights’ violated.

complete utter stupidity. 

ive seeing people neighborhood wearing mask. hard president literally thinks wearing mask political statement. Dr Fauci appears downplaying inadequacies Trump's response COVID19, like covered Reagan's mishandling AIDS crisis. need modern day Larry Kramer keep Fauci honest. Obviously deal devil know working dozens vaccines. Obvious troll obvious. Good economy... even law, else would way resources devoted crimes enough money commit. 

It's capital—and sensibilities people capital protect. feel like always thing every state. LOL that's one way kill economy NY. honestly think would anything like that? sure living time period rest us? government orchestrated 9/11 expect given early warning signs intelligence agency? Hahaha yikes! Glad I'm far mindset Sorry, 2020 done yet. Stop trying cancel it, efforts futile. Please share, tell others. hurting humans whatever believe in. Yeah actually know one heard say day - people die. said it’s someone know even you? people don’t think happen anyone lives. It’s ignorance. think sociologists humanities folks work pathologists create concrete findings structural forces racism caused black communities susceptible COVID. 

I academic emphasis rhetoric white nationalism race. I’d love work medical professionals study racism intertwined COVID. 

Another important focus prisons, large black populations. Last week tonight great segment surge cases prisons going ignored. Let’s hope contain region....

Weird didn’t keep social distancing orders place begin with. US Conservatives: open up! want go public large gatherings! Masks infringement freedom!

Also US Conservatives: maniacs! could gather large groups wear masks! fault! Wtf! already pain get tests he's making harder?! hospitals basically full numbers increasing every day. Wtf bullshit. I've taken go back business. people them. Yeah think mine husband's drinking whole thing could maybe make people drinking less, lol. one 100% failure rate rhesus monkey trails? Oh Jesus. He's governor. Totally hypocritical consistently favor state. seem like big crime. I'm sure overall correlation exists sooner public required wear mask overall responce rates well. post pretty goddamned ambiguous. mention *conservative* news reels. Yeah think initial outbreak much severe official numbers cases deaths China. That's point: didn't. percent PTSD result extreme germaphobes. interesting see sort impact population 10 years now. Hygiene Hypothesis merit see extreme test case next decade. Tests free state. 1-2 days results. free drive thru test 2 hour line get results 15 min I'm surprised hanging ear. think know full story years come.

A friend asking virus' exist. Simple population control. one species gets large, virus balance ecosystem. thought moment finally realized ""The planet ejecting us"". Yes. widespread perception Danes gregarious/open.

Do want share perceptions? nationality you? live? ever Nordic countries? Europe? Ahh makes sense. mean yeah, tested. can't clinical trial 100 people say works.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  weirdness going Florida numbers. report publicly vs. report state report well dashboard match.  


For example, reported 3500 positives Sat like 4700 - yesterday reported shy 3000 cases board said shy 2800 - today number reported less number report dashboard.  


What's difference? used update twice day publicly - stopped that. maybe still internally announce publicly? know. explanation would nice. I’m agreement you. I’m saying protests caused them, biggest common denominator mask usage 0 regards social distancing *indoors* places hit hardest right now. politicized masks screwed themselves. wonder plan enforce president. Worst case, perpetually pay fine, money him. handling terrible response changed completely, whether wears mask changes nothing pettt problem. NYC'er, despite that, he's done tremendous job considered overall leadership stands days. Canadians allowed yet?! think i'm going pull plug. seems like i'm asking trouble going, essential travel means. 

Getting tested good idea either way. absolutely right. Though think parallel similar would think people medical profession, especially niche areas actually passionate work hence belong excellent category rather 'just job'. bring office government politics totally see that. 

And agree, care one else. caring myself. scientific evidence advice direct contradiction gut feeling. knowing wrong then, still hesitate go slippery slope trusting medical professionals trusting self cause that's extremes come play well. Anti vaccination, believing corona conspiracy. 

All all, like said, let down. trusting 'science'. Makes wonder risk infection spread currently abroad. Like, article published within known incubation time current ATTRACTS 8KM QUEUE GERMAN TOURISTS EU BORDERS REOPEN saying anyone Gütersloh queue, something worth thinking times sickness vacation. traditionally racism? one saying death rate going 2500-3000 day necessarily. 600-700 deaths day still lot see kind significant increase countries strong healthcare systems virus control pretty pathetic. (outside) That's funny, rest US quarantining people NY. Gives bad look us Christians... sigh... sorry behalf, guys Thank you. 

I tried paste full article apparently Automod hates news. really hope works. Caesar kill everyone opposed him. did, may assassinated, since leaders plot men pardoned previously. appreciate offer support family's expenses, despite assumption protective measures taken, tests I've taken came back positive instead negative. can’t wait Eh...Indian various African nations do. Belmont County Ohio lots friends work service industry making nervous. restaurants/bars/casinos mandate masks employees, patrons, putting employees extremely high risk (while mildly mitigating risk patrons). friend returned work server said allowed run 50% capacity indoors. Well 50% capacity 250 people. employees wearing masks. Air conditioner running windows closed. It’s recipe absolute disaster guise taking precautions. Like super glad bartender wearing mask washing hands 250 patrons cough freely recycled air. Yes, I've seen thank you. Italy 60+ million people Florida's population less third. try that, ""Car crashes kill people, ban them"" argument?  Same. friends family can’t even courteous want get together like, “Oh, way, went huge neighborhood gathering indoor. shared bunch food drinks close space six hours.” almost makes think sexual promiscuity refusing use protection. there’s way trying stop spread make someone wear socializing condom come around. 😂 Mmm gaslighting improper data, look go! think italian hospitals used drug back March iirc legitimately want know state quarantines enforced. Delaware one, too. in-laws live county NY almost zero covid. health dept even give weekly updates point. one new active case week. family (in PA) locked tight since March. Grocery delivery, leaving house all, reason. feel like safe time go visit them, potential 2nd wave locks us again. Obviously I'm willing sacrifice visit necessary, 70 year old in-laws hugged grandchildren 6 months that's exactly wanting spending golden years. there's quarantine, going stop us put kids dog jail 2 weeks? Give us ticket send us back PA? new case rate didnt start spike 10 days ago. soon draw conclusions. starting see hospital systems hot spots like Arizona Florida start strained day, unfortunately expect high death totals like reporting today. European countries reduced testing -- least since peak epidemics -- basing reopenings hospitalizations death tolls \*alongside\* testing. sensible stuff. tested dramatically Europe, probably find lot asymptomatic cases, what's point hospitals emptying deaths declining? United States somewhat unique encouraging people ""get tested case,"" course leads lot random healthy people getting tested -- asymptomatically positive -- beer bar last night worried. think lost credibility? buddy neighbors watching house binoculars. gf flew quarantine him. They're strictly obeying 14 day quarantine.  Glad see I'm remembered. So, Norway wonders like sorry colleagues patients, go this.

Stay strong, Texans! say that? 
Do link referring article? shut state California did

cause California well right interesting. butterfly effect quite unpredictable. It’s asinine. argument don’t interface customers shouldn’t need mask since wash hands much we’d like stay 6 ft apart one another. Wearing mask sends wrong message colleagues can’t mature enough take precautions don’t trust leadership office safe. blown proportion “fake news” certain party doomers. Interesting note owners/mgmt vocal members party lobbied hard local leadership open us back up. obviously don’t agree bs really need job keep mouth closed stew day. It’s like living poorly written sci-fi movie. I'd like see it... CO quarantine allowed counties. I'm sure enforced sort zoning make sense.

One idea split population 'regions' could , B , C , regions can't go someone outside region.

So f wanted get haircut need ... would help isolate us more. That's thing, level testing early March NYC, would said mostly young people, like they're currently saying Florida. STAY mostly young people. That’s disingenuous hell. Whether agree wasn’t argument “(Mr. Franklin), got? republic monarchy?”

Benjamin Franklin: “A republic, keep it.” Outbreak announcements going write themselves. Someone great salesman, fun watch. know calculated it, look, percentages 75% people NY don’t go outside state, 75% people going go NY cancel, would reduction 150%? can’t reduction higher 100%, amount people traveling states can’t negative amount people. Germany worrying increase r0? wonder means infected families stay hospital together. guess want simplistic obsitnate child, that's one way looking it. checked West 7th Ft. Worth Texas saw maybe 4 masks total montage parties

(May NWS, adult objects present moron. Wouldn’t logic require fatality rate linear wrt hospital capacity? doesn’t necessarily hold thing ration air travel New York would suspended. National Guard/troopers would rounded called freeway highway areas state. Maybe Border Patrol types.

That's legit way think could done. They've got Jesus air ducts. must American then. mean New Zealand let in? Economy didn’t won, man. Economy fucked year we’ll see effects autunno Oh good, idiocy Yeah. dont know area you’re definitely consider getting tested dont want cancel trip. state there’s lot free testing available seems like they’re saying , would another option - get tested like 3-4 days plan take flight get result around time arriving. downright infuriating. I'm lucky/grateful work employer straight said nope, Everyone work home That's whole argument trump. think played realize it. mispronounced ""predictable"". didn’t share technology navy because....

Oh that’s right sell lies business. average time first symptoms hospitalization 3 weeks (at least state) That's person socialization. Yeah, somebody’s gotta something. executive branch failed country regarding response COVID, hope legislature get SOMETHING done. Lol understand must really scary... wear mask, sneeze towards face, guess fine. 6 feet distance, please respec doc Almost sounds like months late need Colorado! spike cases, it’s going tourism. way see many new tests conducted state every day? Somewhere easily consume information (i.e. +7,000 tests) rather calculate myself? Secondly, hope agree scars would worse.

Actually, bet agree. That's antibody-dependent enhancement. still great degree protection infections strain (serotype), even dengue. ADE becomes factor catch another serotype, instances viral diseases, like dengue virus.

In case — also worrying couple months ago —, it'd like got infected ""SARS-CoV-3"" rather SARS-CoV-2 again. great degree protection SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e. COVID-19), ADE factor, ""SARS-CoV-3"" infection could worse due previous SARS-CoV-2 infection enhancing effects new SARS-CoV-3 infection. Thats one case. told stay inside local government enforced it. towns cops tell person theyd arrested left house, Cuomo intervened. wants same.

Cuomo isnt great guy, one people empathetic easy understand message height pandemic NY megathread r/sweden might suitable post discusses swedish data, also subreddit journalism, one. Minor nitpick: anybody else get annoyed headlines keep saying things ""record number cases""? Seems overly sensational. ""record"" implies kind statistic tracked awhile - 3 months. agree definitely think everyone exercising increased caution right now....I see lot people (and don’t believe you’re included this, seem well-informed) misinterpret *can* happen *does* happen...like 150 people possibly exposed virus hair stylist...around day 11 exposure, article came saying one shown symptoms yet resounding response ‘BUT INCUBATION PERIOD ISNT OVER’...which true...is informed view situation. Almost 98% show symptoms day 11, sure, maybe someone could become symptomatic three proceeding days, you’re going hit day 14 suddenly 150 symptomatic people...that statistical impossibility. think seeing here, well. Could see spike week six? Perhaps, since seen *any* increase week four, seeming less less likely *could* take six weeks, certainly wouldn’t take every single case six weeks reported. National PSA: wear masks, wash/sanitize hands, socially distance. Social behavior norms need change. number bullshit. calculation, actually based real measure recoveries, i.e. positive negative tests hospital departures.  No, actually doesn't. subject matter experts openly lie forfeit credibility eyes party that's making even passing effort objective  still drive around Helped immensely millions state people came NY every day. NY get control dealing spreaders coming every direction, adding already insane density.

Meanwhile half rest America lives rural area can't figure even make dent cases. guys figure part out, let us know. Asking congress literally anything much. haven’t done anything years Culture nothing it. Poverty does, stupid cunt. ask wearing seatbelt means 'living fear' car crashes. one enforcing Maine. Saffron colored snake oil acceptable source you?

Something demonstrated time time serve powers truth. really matter completely spoke truth once, they've chance.

Seriously, look shopping list BBC integrity scandals. There's literally reason think BBC ""journalism"" credible Well, psychopath saw unmasked Target yesterday would one them. Alaska switched system recently posted r/moronavirus. Yup Crowded areas little masks sight. places done well reopenings you’re seeing high mask utilization, respect social distancing and/or both. States going around population acting careless thinking ones getting hammered hardest right work remotely laptop right -- like people -- time share thought then. Shocking, know. Good man, stay safe. Good sanitary practices masks work. Simple. What’s point people aren’t socially distancing wearing masks? Lifting restrictions early without well-defined plan. Northern LA County here, COVID hospitalizations, ICU low. pretty certain we'll spike soon. hit yet. We're handling poorly U.S., shit gonna take longggggg time resolve here.... worldometer says 80 new deaths today, would since 4/28 Abstract


Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) commonly associated acute respiratory infection humans immune responses 'common cold' viruses remain incompletely understood. Moreover, evidence emerging independent studies suggests endemic HCoVs induce broadly cross-reactive cell responses may thereby affect clinical outcomes acute infections phylogenetically related epidemic viruses, namely MERS-CoV SARS-CoV-2. report comprehensive retrospective analysis CoV-specific antibody specificities large number samples children adults using Phage-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). estimate seroprevalence endemic HCoVs range ~4% ~27% depending species cohort. importantly, identified large number novel linear B cell epitopes HCoV proteins demonstrate antibody repertoires endemic HCoVs qualitatively different children comparison general adult population healthy adult blood bank donors. show anti-HCoV IgG specificities frequently found among children target functionally important structurally conserved regions HCoV spike nucleocapsid proteins antibody specificities broadly cross-reactive peptides epidemic human non-human coronavirus isolates. findings shed light humoral immune responses natural infection endemic HCoVs may important implications understanding highly variable clinical outcomes human coronavirus infections, development prophylactic therapeutic monoclonal antibodies vaccine design. Ok, specific. tnf blockers study looked at. Remicade tnf blocker, though, yes.

However, husband still 3-4x likely catch infections, comparable increase severity. hospitalization rates reduced - less likely kill catch it.

Stay safe. going good, like stock market, right? media never say due protests  Wild, don’t even know say state spread issue NY. comes back state, NY overwhelmingly likely point origin chain infections.

Just make masks mandatory indoors group public end year. Neither links supports conclusion it’s cultural. first link isn’t even source second concludes due lack availability healthy foods due poverty food desserts. Another attempt convince us immune really getting back work back shops per capita

do smell toast? done Singapore.

# American FedEx pilot imprisoned breaking quarantine order Singapore

**Brian Dugan Yeargan sentenced four weeks prison leaving hotel room three hours buy masks He'll probably quarantine nursing homes. Lakelander correct. Central Florida business usual business STUPID. Lakeland commissioners met yesterday discuss possible mask mandate. Take guess answer landed on. Good luck that. Question Arizona, currently helping family member out. It’s confusing dad seems think a) course increased cases testing more. b) people get tested multiple times counts multiple cases c) long we’re wearing mask we’ll fine. Ironically we’re AZ going CA week (another hot zone). taking...? New York City 2 million. never beat that! kind thing “but 99% survive” crowd simply don’t understand. We’re playing game chance unknown virus could potentially lasting consequences even otherwise survive it.

I co-worker who’s lung capacity still normal confirmed March infection. mention lost 30 lbs 3 week battle virus, considered non-critical “mild.” 

Why willingly risk putting situation? Makes believe people still alarmingly blind potential risks aren’t simply “small chance death.” likely takes strict regimen hydroxychloroquine.. pretty sure hes even said does. thinks hes immune Hopefully younger people nursing homes getting hit, would reduce deaths. I'm Las Vegas. governor/mayor thing WILD. Except pretty competent governor acted quickly enough keep numbers low early, versus cartoon Breitbart Carmela Soprano. high risk? so, make arrangements. No. disagree. Covid-19 respiratory disease, already established masks help reduce transmission. Dr. Fauci probably influenced politics, undermined fundamental science. Yes, developing science slow often reported sensation, fundamental science needs communicated public officials. politics start influence basic science, that's know anti-science taken public discourse. years pushing creationism public school, unexpected development. 1) travel family members place mid Atlantic New England. pass weekly NY never actually stop there. Also dont think NYS anywhere near infrastructure create data base tracking every license plate passes analyze movement. 

2) Fine hotels already hurting going buy this

3) Like what? people island Maine fell tree front state neighbors? charged crime. dont want vigilantes learned doesnt work nonsense. ask wear mask obey rules everybody else nobody going stand discrimination state plates from.  I’m sorry education system failed don’t firm grasp statistics statistical evaluation. very, small percentage survivors permanent disability. are, even smaller percentage working age. Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations skyrocketed 7% (all time high). ICU beds COVID patients 5% (all time high). Ventilators use COVID went 2% (all time 

This fine.jpg username, sure some... opinions.

I've living Asia past 20 years, people wear masks allergy protection, also protect others regular viruses well. So... exactly ""dumb"". Come America, man up. Yeah, heard that, Anti Vax stance also. think all-time average. Scotland long way go, start.

Not many countries better all-time average NZ. Australia Vietnam - two countries similarly successful, seems key indicator. Remember Texas quarantined people NY? It’s time return favor. thats death blow patrons. thats viable. countries can't maintain precautions indefinitely. 

Once spread virus control hard avoid thing. everyone Earth SARS MERS. virus spreads easily people take longer get sick get sick all, take right precautions now, need return except areas outbreak shows up. Murder tort state, i.e. crime. sued murder, charged Fuck. Authoritarianism great open source. leader sucks, fork it. Can’t fork country. single holiday little anything. Idk people keep referring memorial day reason, states started trend around memorial day. everything opening poorly. think issue citizens country likely adhering social distancing rules avoiding large gatherings. much case FL (at least state). 

So people wearing masks, also keeping space people avoiding crowds. case, masks would help lot would least compensate bit refusing social distance well gathering groups. 

Y'all likely okay citizens stubborn idiots, words, unfortunately large portion States can't say same. either staying home business usual (sans masks), exceptions. Darwinism finest, assume people getting infected due going event care themselves, playing Russian Roulette saying fuckit, die, die..Anything Master President.. know hotels motels, gas stations restaurants seem checking - also everyone wearing mask public. seems 50/50 I've seen. Fauci back, bitches! Missed man. written ensure right matter catastrophe. George Washington smallpox. Covid cold compared that. Man fill pox marks wax. I'm sure higher opinion Americans 2016 first elected. worked fairly well Hawaii, problem enforcement. opened domestic travel. come select Nordic countries. 

Let's see fare allow population travel again, allow visitors countries come without 10 day quarantine. 

They still locked down, delaying inevitable fully open up. 

It smug false sense security, since cannot maintain current policy forever. yeah anyways. last job included working local city leadership lot. wife's job includes certain degree. mayor, least tries railroaded local university owns majority city, we're without much leadership.  Australia too. states even starting pass bill person quarantining. many, I'm mobile time atm sorry surprised hear vaccine development took £46 million. high number, low compared entertainment industry budgets. I’m surprised countries ranked worse us. said often 2016 anymore im trip across canada right borders arent even manned think things likely play, important two (1) NY screwed royally nursing homes, unnecessarily contributed lot deaths (2) several treatments significantly reduce mortality. doubt we'll ever get back death rates NY. Lol north since started we've outright bans traveling provinces mandatory 14 day quarantine essential travel, crazy people straight slashing tires vandalizing vehicles province plates. LOL come nazi checkpoints tappanzee bridge receive critique cause goal flatten curve.
Covid dissappear many many get end day.
They predict 85% infected rate said done. 

Sweden simply letting virus run course without much attempt flatten said curve. 

In end day, best virus known beat it. still long fight ahead us. Ah, like Georgia. government mask requirement cities allowed overrule. universities open fall, school system already said masks required -- 'strongly encouraged.'  did, saying rally, talking kids sniffles? I'm thinking lines people KS coming back AZ visiting family switching planes PHX go MCI, etc. Summer ’69 spreading false rumors personal life. harassment. Please stop. saying he's following orders? good defense Nürnberg trials Nazis 🙈 Puerto Rico double counting numbers period time, dropped large negative 6/11 one time correction. Texas Thanks sharing. thought California one exception, exactly sure worked.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* weren’t shit Reid either f) sounds great! stupid things, win stupid prizes Yes much better explanation thank you! going try hold trump accountable tweet ignore way chinese president acted towards world I'm conversation mr ""oNe DiMeNsIoNaL"" question person feel pain feeling lung inflammation? people won’t get it. Less 1% Earth’s population gotten virus far. caused uptick cases? Perhaps, explains New York, New Jersey, Italy? phase re-opening experiencing spikes Arizona, Texas, Florida, California. It’s high price pay sure :(  Yep. symptomatic cases, nearly all. wish wife gung ho learning things are. barber back open point learning messing hair lol. told blend pull clipper away neck get high up. said ok hear BZZZZZZ immediately knew lol. Well, stupid. Moved Florida 4 years ago work. compromised immune system staying inside since March 13th trust idiots. Never done world wide. historically see like Black Death place place basis, still returned NEVER got close eradicated r/treedibles Bear mind minor cases found hospitalizations rate lower go along I'd like read got link. states?????? guess don’t get it, ultimate goal? stay closed vaccine may may work? People jobs people need go back work. government really doesn’t money keep giving unemployment absurd reason, Poland apparently not, Swedes come go please. June 15th, Poland closed even countries much better severely hurting many people process - suddenly, everyone come in! Nothing really makes sense ... Money talks. friendly reminder NY 30k deaths FL 3,200.

I wish people would put lot states perspective trashing Florida. Yes we’ve seen spike lately, many deaths lead to?

1,000? 2,000 you’re pessimistic? Certainly 27,000 Can't take course antibiotics bug. 100 days late. Lesser men would thrown hands walked off, dude sticking even bullshit irresponsibility Trump demonstrates daily basis. calling limited capacity online classes, I'm assuming also calling places like gyms remain closed, calling lockdown. Got it. * Monday June 22 [The chief physician Gällivare said chaotic situation: ""We room meaning hospital Gallivare exceeded capacity.


Compare situation healthcare system “severely strained” neighbors (Finland, Denmark, Norway) problems like Sweden’s failure becomes clear. bad Italy? No. means “success”. It’s like “just barely staying water, arguably even regards”. rightfully should. Someone US let Sweden EU suspect. pandemic control. Nothing funny it. amount number pumping stop patients needing go hospital. Nothing says due diligence like pulling liquor license they've center major outbreak

""No one could predicted this""

Everyone predicting this, dismissed opinions. one cried bloody murder states trying quarantine New Yorkers?

And still forcing nursing homes take positive cases murdering grannies thousands quietly stop that? spent morning teaching, might go ahead research COVID Africa. I’m well read that. Sure, slowly. One big hammer would alternative starve first. collective luck year they'll turn friggin zombie friend Greece telling friend back home works tourism department Greece telling Americans would probably one last people they’d let Europe. said can’t risk even though would really like tourist money. percentage people general population active coronavirus infection 0.14% Massachusetts right now. one keep new york rats city? ""They"" also vulnerable around ones trusted leadership tell truth act best interest. Unlucky foolish president. Isnt New York hot spot? Wow. Well that's good. clue things stringent here, I'm Missouri unfortunately doubt it. well say effects covid could last longer think “cured”........idk mean, two weeks hotel food expenses inconvenience. massive financial burden. kids, doubly so. Cancer treatment already exorbitant US. There's way could afford hotel two weeks. doomerism America grotesque. feel blessed second passport right now, want live country that's giving public schools, public transit, bars pubs, respiratory virus. almost 7 months thing globally still don’t answers questions, frustrating Staying closed year option. Lockdowns work really well immunity virus spreads really easily reopen. That's states really poorly great (most northeast) cases rising West early lockdowns. south (and western rural areas) never really closed rural naturally flatter curve peaks later seeing rising cases. take things least. way really limit spread everyone wear masks, good contact tracing, obey social distancing still opening like South Korea Japan. I'm sure that's possible Europe United States. Ultimately madness Serbian authorities let event happen. shot they're receiving ounce criticism Djokovic getting.

They're playing football crowds Serbia. tennis event probably even biggest spreading event country last week. Tell nightclub owners Miami. They're basically waging biological warfare populations now. Yeah I'd run away comments talking government trying protect well. Good luck living bubble LOL, use seatbelts? condoms?

I mean, probably not... actually group people pointing laughing wearing mask day. far enough away didn’t confront (plus they’d probably cough something, best keep distance). wtf wrong people? I’m wearing mask protect *you*, assholes. Iirc one country two ventilators millions people. imagine big countries donate run them? True, I've made posts clearly say I'm american people reply trump related stuff lol"
