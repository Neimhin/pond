Hopefully enough people choose get vaccine ever reason - even travel.
Arguments like going make feel oppressed  sympathize little bit hypocrisy overrides rational thinking it’s time call is.

It inconvenient young child developing speech appropriately can’t see teacher friends mouth speaks. inconvenient 10 year old anxiety tell play playground mask. family doe part, per science, don’t give shit call hypocrisy see it.

Just say you’re scared move on. Don’t tell science maybe little wrong time emotions can’t handle it. language critical here. much 50%.... Let quote another source: ""England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said best estimate Indian variant somewhere percent 50% transmissible, data provide clearer picture next week.""

\-----

Now sage's model said: **IF** variant 40% (or more) transmissible likely .....

\-----

So mean worst case scenario also ""likely"" says 50 75% probability event. Otherwise ""very likely"" ""extremely likely.""

\---

""The Pfizer Moderna Covid vaccines remain highly effective two coronavirus variants first identified India, according new research carried US scientists.""

source: conclusion:

* **definitely** see resurgence hospitalisations equal exceeding previous peaks. That's simply happening, worst case modelling seriously accounted latest data shows vaccine efficacy remains.
* think actually disagree much except terrified new mutation. virus mutates per case transmission (approximately average) - need dig source.
* Unless something comes along completely side-steps Pfizer AZ vaccines, UK never bad position before.

Disclosure: covid may impact perspective 'survivor' really wants get life. King here: 

It's official suggestion, officially mandated. confusing, probably design, trying clear. anecdotal, cousin waiting finish finals get shot. assume others worried getting side effects studies good news. I'm surprised, hell ya, people. 

Still high, holy crap, getting there.  testify parents know (and someday tell weird hang people generation younger PTA etc..). Almost without exception parents lot respect schools, esp teachers. old lady says thank God internet, cannot fathom would gotten old days. , course, pluses minuses kids. overall would say plus, kid could call friends see them, cool that. perfect but... digress vaccines required...why also mandating masks?

I get vaccines required, universities requiring fall? Oh yeah. really nothing worth looking anymore. Since sub going mostly people got shots early every state going give masks soon, really much talk about.. good year overreacting fights, hard let go.  Even then, appears vaccines protect asymptomatic infection transmission (to extent know yet). zoom look population whole really weigh efficacy. Using Yankees case extrapolate efficacy different someone saying ""well know 2 people got covid fine"" flipside ""I know 4 people got covid three died""

Neither would representative truthful data. situations happen, they're ""norm"". correct well circumstances impact things. Big difference passing exposure 20 min masks, around infected person days. promise problem. bought bunch 3M N95s year half ago Lowe's figured we're lied to. getting Covid spreading it. cut $2000/month social activities eating I'm okay feel comfortable long term effects I'm likely encounter over, make time.

No, fine. Everyone different reactions, people reaction all. sure got shot, reactions also take hours set in. Let tell crazy coworker always referred HIPPO. Okay, trust you. health expert, worried? I’m shocked La Guardia? Sinovac proved effective Turkey? obvious indeed I'm glad one people! feeling insurance companies going play hardball vaccines get FDA approval. wait til anti-vaxxers wave coverage covid, get sick, leave alive get $100k+ medical bill. Vaccines way disease catastrophic vaccines work people choose take makes people won’t vaccinate problem Texas offer free gun snd free tiger. Lol, seriously, naive. Businesses profitable, expedient, (for better worse) respond social trends. countries similar numbers people won’t take vaccine. Many worse numbers. number cases Israel around 20 new cases per day. less 70 critically ill patients total.

18 vaccinated people infected 3 critically, 1 dead nursing home \*does\* seem notable put context infections country. article include background information also published country presumably know they've dropped low levels. got 1st dose zero side effects sore arm Kids learn speech different ages. covid, perfectly normal kids didn’t talk 3, sister one, 30 years ago. Also, plenty oppurtunities safely enrich young person, even vaccine approved age group yet. 

I thought little one would learn much faster older, watch listen to, opposite occured. Don’t get discouraged. end? We'd opening door, I'm afraid leads. banks credit bureaus refuse loans based vaccine status? people refuse vaccinated unable travel find employment?

What's alternative? let people assume responsibility risk? vaccine proves safe effective extreme measures necessary. sympathy antivaxx crowd, certainly think solution forcing comply arranging society pariahs get vaccinated. multiple days around 300-400 spike. However can't recall breaching 1k little already tremendous progress last fall winter. weird, look giving blood. shots, seem feel mostly painless *only* dont watch. losing Memorial Day?

Go whatever want... outdoor mask mandates one going give grief bar unmasked drinking.

You also, always able to, whatever want private residence. Pretty sure I'll celebrating Memorial Day bunch friends BBQ outside go sit inside central air.  people use HIPAA arguement ones self appointed virology experts. vaccine best protection. Please see friends it’s okay. care vaccinated. subject anything. done. count. Back normal life already may God them. 

the unvaccinated subject: infect unvaccinated including children deadly virus spreading air.

is clear?  Everyone died past century dihydrogen monoxide bodies! Coincidence? think so! Fortunately, according ton data straight CDC, ""The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared course hopefully kids get either, find helpful try think actual risks based data keep worrying much kid. would zero ever? People sub: ""We need people take vaccine boost vaccination rates""

Some American politicians: ""How lottery states worked Ohio""

People sub: ""No like this""

*****

Seriously y'all complaining lotteries. boosts vaccination rates, yay! Good thing!

That late Wednesday, 67.3 percent Maryland residents 18 older received least one shot.

It's Maryland struggling get people vaccinated.  know study. Plenty facebook memes say otherwise. /s Three That’s big care home! Pfizer BioNTech gang checking in. Uhhh people refuse wear masks properly problem. Government officials refuse enforce temporary shutdown order eradicate virus shut borders problem. Medical officials told people last year go celebrate Chinese New Year's masks work problem.  doubt Canada would use AstraZeneca, beyond second dose, sure happen. feel Canada going mostly use mRNA.

I hope moderna steps up, delivers doses. feel like everyone take look page write ""DON'T PANIC"" Calendar Nov 1st. Cases expected rise fall (mostly among non-vaccinated), expect lots ""COVID back!"" headlines, they're expected rise control. Deaths likely never get back even rates now. We're gonna die I'll quote SAGE, written latest set restrictions lifted. think there's anything worry based that, well, there's much say.

*It ‘highly likely variant transmissible B.1.1.7 (high confidence), realistic possibility much 50% transmissible‘, minutes meeting Government’s scientific advisers Thursday read.* 
 
*If variant 40% 50% transmissible, likely Monday’s easing restrictions could lead ‘a substantial resurgence hospitalisations similar to, larger than, previous peaks’, add.* Also, flu caused influenza virus. coronavirus causes Covid. Take bullshit elsewhere. Without them, Canada horrible vaccine rate.

The strategy diverse suppliers good one. Somebody deserves cookie. I’m covid vaccine RN I’ve people decked classic Q/antivax uniform: red baseball hat, kind blue lives matter t-shirt, etc, go covid hoax, vaccine experimental, *insert weird pseudo patriotic statement freedom*

And roll sleeve shot. (They’ve already signed consent verbally consented me). It’s probably due fact severely underweight tbh agree completely, make 160 drawings $10k, still life changing lot people. look like losing boxer coming back more: 

we MUST protect children maskless unvaccinated .

is option : **we MUST that.**

you help: tell friends get vaccinated immediately save children Ugh, sounds terrible. also got first BioNTech/Pfizer week ago side effects whatsoever.   I'm arguing deadlier virus kids need require masks school. People reacting. never spread rapid before. Younger kids fine masked medical professionals family, blows mind nurses act like this. comes someone giving/providing medical care another person, take stuff like seriously, really makes question well they're job. maybe fair assumption, can't help feel way. absolutely need nationwide solution. posted show QR code thing done, issue lies scaling refusal federal government pick damn vendor (or house) roll something 50 states businesses subscribe to. made leap! understood correctly, saying human immune system effective vaccine. simply true.

It’s difficult say. depends end terms total vaccinations demand shot really starts sputter. Probably total immunity end somewhere 60-70% range, virus become endemic instead pandemic. could see cases dip well 10k summer rise somewhat winter continues behave seasonally. Probably never go away completely may seasonal precautions foreseeable future. think mostly identity politics. correct governments already central databases vaccine records. Pediatricians/schools use time. Avoid reposting information, please. Well cases started reaching low numbers recently (it seems magic number 50-60% partially vaccinated see cases drop off, seen NJ, previously one worst one best states). deaths always lagged case trends bit whole pandemic. based think it’s mostly first needed get certain threshold vaccines (which really reaching now) waiting deaths follow trend means sarcastic. Unfortunately necessary lot blatant sarcasm people get triggy happy argue can't read context. people take really really long time die covid.

I'm curious US, also globally, estimates available. 

Have people vaccinated point covid? It’s terms of... catching Covid death sentence, wearing mask death sentence someone else, anyone disagrees die. coexist Covid long it’s wildfire fatal.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Genuine question. different COVID-19 made masks effective it?

Before now, generally thought masks really much prevent spread respiratory viruses, studies said much. Without making pro-mask/anti-mask debate, COVID changed that? still really seen stated clearly anywhere. cdc comes says vaccinated don’t need wear mask anymore. Dude pandemic vaccinated people. Stop living fear. think caught guard. given little cases last year, infrastructure set handle surge. think like 2nd wave UK gave Thank part. Thank part. Thank part. Would love see Knicks this! tickets way expensive seeing go far rare man! Thank part. Hmm maybe it’s got mine one megapod sites? came healthvana, maybe check they’re virus reservoirs fuck downvoted? used work NY pandemic. wished would adopt mask wearing like Asia.

Between piss smell streets, guys subway wet, hacking coughs pleasant. aww, good luck him! two make sure stay healthy well :). papers enter place business.

You've never bar college town, see. trust like hasn't, that's strongly favor allowing it. Businesses deny service anything protected class, vaccination status written law. help long run covid! Seems little early give contact tracing. like week in. dig deep try catch every case spread widely yet. Since lawyers need explain basic common sense laws....? like explaining murder is. people saying HIPAA violation 100% know not. say anything excuse. nothing politics. entirely trust people honest vaccinated.

Continuing wear mask market small inconvenience me. big deal you, it. give dirty looks maskless, offended keep distance you. Without modern medicine great healthcare infrastructure, Czech covid death would exceed Spanish flu.  
The big culprit current PM know stop it. health board recalled May September little done prevention, safety. Add sheet stupidity people disregarded threat, lack enforcement epidemic raged, modern health disaster. every place want know something funny. 

My elementary age daughter hasn’t missed day classroom education due Covid year last. 

We never went remote daily email receive Superintendent, total 12 kids it

District wide 

But “ kids don’t show much... testing numbers... can’t right read online ...”

So may agree politics behind it, challenge science probably pointed decision direction took. 

Science Politics 


Oh... WaIT tWo wEeKs Reeeeeeeeeeee zip Walmart today get husband's medication saw sign door said vaccinated people required wear mask.

Written bottom sign, said, ""Walmart employees verifying vaccination status.""

_Okay then._ Also luckily masks social distancing, like flu here. Wondering like year. agree logic, also consider guy behind counter Chipotle might thrilled mask-optional thing. 

If ever worked retail, know mean. hope India get vaccines soon Interesting! definitely take consideration talk kids’ pediatrician. feel like husband told Fauci said gets first comes second time like December January...? could something totally misheard. know fact parents (over 60) get double dose once. also lady PERSONALLY knew 30 people caught it, 2 died, yet concluded covid either fake worse flu. 

Are couple acquaintances dying flu every year? brainwashed stupid could people get? know info how? interested route. There's little hope us here. know someone else recently same. talked doctor made plan. 

I encourage anyone else similar situation talk professional. It’s common. We’ll many months get people vaccinated then, including little kids September. still probably increase winter, manageable one.  CDC's input those, still mentioning Indian variant / strain, US point, probably now: BBC's take (of course related US):  think something read said info made available health care orgs. Thank service. Covid nursing year. receive hazard pay. 12 May 2021, MHRA received Yellow Card reports 309 cases major thromboembolic events (blood clots) concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) UK following vaccination COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. events occurred 169 women 138 men aged 18 93 years overall case fatality rate 18% 56 deaths. **Fifteen cases reported second dose.**

MHRA advises evolving evidence taken account considering use vaccine. evidence reported incidence rate higher females compared men although seen across age groups difference remains small.  
 
The overall incidence first unknown doses 12.3 per million doses hope beginning end US, takes another month taper off. seems possible one spike might occur next month two instead, related new strains spreading faster among people vaccinated. 

Given number people already vaccinated maybe tapering actually already represents spike, look like one, since would higher proportion smaller subset. hate pessimist expect one real uptick US instead, least could resolved consistent additional vaccinations.

This perspective partly based living Thailand roughly protections eliminated virus last year, saw decline January spike, barely keeping even level. Lots factors combine though, one change inputs causing that.  Yeah. wonder potential outcome is. Like, tell doctor sneak vac... seems, hmmm, sad doable time Japan 95 deaths per million pandemic.

Is trade worth it? That's absurd question. 

Literally everything comes risk. banned cars tomorrow 38k lives would saved year car deaths. would course come tons unintended consequences ban cars. make mistake, allowing cars exist saying ""don't care"" (your words) 38k lives lost year car deaths.

And that's thing public health, balancing risk vs benefits, making risk 0, would tons unintended consequences puritanical it. 30,000 cases national 7-day average! took us ten days get &lt;40,000 &lt;30,000. Could see &lt;20,000 end month? would put us lowest point since near beginning pandemic (April 1, 2020) bit information coupled lower chance getting virus first place?

The way read it, vaccine presents two hurdles virus:

1st hurdle: infection (95% efficacy mRNA vaccines)

If virus clears first hurdle (breakthrough), virus clear 2nd hurdle order impact others.

2nd hurdle: transmission (40%-60% lower chance unvaccinated). 

In context, vaccination provides robust level protection, individual around them. Yup I’d imagine states all. Michigan’s called MCIR. issue I’ve seen tho pharmacists input information missed doses people know vaccinated one clinics. 100 people I’ve noticed 10 people show 1 dose imagine happened elsewhere. Make sense. state, opened largest college campus, town became hotspot C19 cases 10x.  It’s good thing don’t care opinion.

Note, great job controlling confounders, let's say 800 accurate discussion sake.

There's 6 million school children Texas.

Is 800 deaths worth 6 million kids access person learning? reflexively say no, many deaths worth kids access school? say 0, operating real world scenario, everything comes risk.

Korea informative. lack random testing really astounded me. school says close 30% sick and/or home, well we're school like 350 students continent Africa also population median age 18 compared 27 India, 37 USA 40 UK.

They obviously going hit hard disease mainly hits elderly. ""Case Fatality Ratio"", i.e. percentage cases died. anecdotal evidence proved something else.
The person died highest tier risk groups.

All others know mild symptoms.
Including couple elderly 70-80.They symptoms all.Their grandchildren much severe symptoms fully recovered well. think point made you’re kind person uses word “fact” lightly. Scroll up. say obvious hugely relevant fact Florida wasn’t exposed first. He’s wrong.  obvious hypothesis asymptomatic spread among kids school resulted infection symptomatic cases older family members.

Are routine asymptomatic testing data among students? Maybe UK, California? able answer right data. r/noshitsherlock come aefi straight got website enter random district search district news death u find Ps. site available country apparently know guy got vaccinated died too, horrible car crash ngl Missouri spending $5M yet another ad campaign push ""vaccine Information"". information going get vaccine hesitant vaccine resistant people vaccinate, chance win cash might. $5M could put better use. posting daily, spamming? Imagine every countries posted numbers daily.  true vast majority COVID19 infections asymptomatic? quite possible someone COVID19 never even going stop wearing mask

I'm equally jaded, think there's three groups people: 

- Vaccinated
- Slackers/hesitants/wait-and-sees/ambivalents
- Anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers

The CDC going middle group. think acknowledge third group probably lost cause unless get spine get aggressive requiring vaccines.

I think theories diverge feel previously wearing masks. 

Here Ohio still mask mandate everyone days ago, ignoring months. Enforcement lax enough let get away it, feels like much really changed here. Assuming government faith effectiveness vaccine still forced wear masks? redditors find capatalist countries america Even though real world data showed good protection hospitalisation death receiving vaccine, still small chance could catch virus vaccine 100% effective. essential everyone continues follow hands, face, space fresh air measures, get tested twice weekly, whether vaccine not, reduce spread virus. still monitoring B.1.617.2 variant investigating effect variant vaccinated individuals. increasing confidence vaccines effective variants concern monitored. Information gathered variant first observed India, far, evidence suggest vaccines less effective strain.
-DR A- wear safety helmet walk up/down flight stairs? Double/triple layer condoms? 

I’m ready rock variants. several bars already baby. Thank getting vaccinated! Bc fucking dumb. Can't fix dumb could happened had, know, actually done something make sure cases went zero. yeah, know, friend vaccinated like months ago. I'm talking ""normal"" European countries, best best best\^100 Latest data available shows vaccination rate 38.6. most. No, South American stop nonsense. you’re nervous reopening say so. Using false boogeyman push sort narrative beyond played out. US citizen? Non-nationals coming UK/EU area cannot get USA right unless quarantine third country partner cannot afford We'll PTSD this, fact exactly same. normal, remnants, heads anyway. Best start figuring deal it. could therapy, could meditation, could letting time pass. advice PS5, sleep Astro's playroom (the tech demo game comes preloaded PS5.)

Most people stop playing twenty minutes first game choice finishes installing never come back it. They're missing out: actually really charming fun platformer reminds lot Ratchet Clank, shows new features new controller really well. mention absolutely insane nostalgia trip, every single piece Sony hardware major title released PlayStation console makes appearance. like love letter entire history PlayStation playing Spiderman, Demon's souls, Hitman still favorite game PS5 released far. really Buzz Aldrin? tell otherwise it’s entrapment Spring Break surge inbound!

I love finally make fun people absurdity views without crucified here. People getting checked COVID cannot afford healthcare. Whatever healthcare available shambles. People accept fate die homes cremeted lucky disposed river. Since clear seasonal trend, 365 days ago trend going without vaccines -- little premature declare pandemic over. definitely helping, doubt, trend probably much nicer slope would been. next interesting test mid-June sun belt states started large peak lasted summer. received AZ vaccine first dose, advised take AZ vaccine second dose. current evidence recommend mixing different types vaccines, although study currently progress investigating possibility mixing vaccines. gap doses reduced 8 weeks give maximum protection B.1.617.2 variant. -DR A- Risk comprised 2 factors: likelihood severity outcome. People seem think likelihood need consider. data seem point previously infected people needing one dose reach efficacy two vaccine doses uninfected. Would nice provision made people order preserve supply also order decrease hesitance start vaccination process they’ll need one shot instead two. really epitome stupid. ""No way injecting shit body, tested long enough, etc""

""Oh free 30 pack, sign up?"" Ignorcance bliss. Oh envy unenlightened 😅 Canada’s goal isn’t scale deaths 600K like US. think protecting health ‘like tyrent’, look North Korea tell we’re similar. septuagenarians live barracks / dormitory style housing coronavirus pandemic, outcome tragedy completely predictable.

It would age discrimination laws hire septuagenarian job even though risks age group.  people worried mRNA funniest, slightest fucking clue works science behind it. either smart enough trust medical professionals, nothing ever convince it’s safe, especially people vaccine upwards several months fewer deaths covid per person 22 states, average U.S.  would use total deaths/cases deaths/cases per capita?

If July/August surge preventable Texas, states harsher restrictions see bad winter surges? 95% new cases something?

It's less -- state highest proportion B.1.1.7 last week data, April...) Tennessee 82%. probably 95% considering B.1.1.7/B.1.526/B.1.427 http://unc.cov2seq.org/ cool data interested.

Those don‘t even think covid real deny serious consequences.
Of course percentage must rise every ongoing day... Statistics? someone reddit says ""I'm scientist"" dear god much vaccines important there’s difference hesitancy seeing (which correlates socioeconomics far political alignment) full Anti Vax. people “wait see” covid vaccine aren’t people refusing give kids Mumps vaccines. people know become vaccinated there’s tangible benefit vaccinated (no mask fully vaccinated) comfortable getting covid vaccine. That's news me, thought allowed deduct half ""entertainment"" expenses nowadays  point laughable insanity incented $1M incented death death far likely outcome winning said lottery. kids fine. two nieces nephew nine mind you, going school maskless months. Granted option mask face shield, nobody gotten sick family died. I'm waiting get appointment. Still deciding one want. Well fuck. got first Wednesday got shit faced last night. think headline even makes lot sense : 

The study apparently says writing, 67% vaccinated  
Americans travel end May, whereas 59%  
unvaccinated Americans wait long. 

That's it. That's says. small gap. say anything people choosing travel afraid coronavirus think vaccines work. 

Headline makes sound like vaccinated people think higher chance dying COVID trip vaccinated people, appear supported data. 15 cases, back zero”

Never forget. allowing vaccinated people scientifically sound advantages like unmasking provides incentives. 

Yeah, suspect part CDC's motivation. Good little boys girls follow rules get ice cream way home playground. Unfortunately (and say sadness), adult life work way. 

Here real world, people want get vaccinated going get vaccinated stop wearing mask. going stop wearing mask, now, thanks CDC's new ruling, people walking around without masks suspicion.

If fact part CDC's reasoning, completely utopian thinking. guess I'm teeny tiny subset vaccinated people bothered anymore. people stop fearmongering longer health

Yep. pro-mask, pro-vaccine dude got jabbed even though virtually zero personal fear bug....yeah, there's hell lot posturing going right now. 500k+ USA say hardly any. 2020 really killed lot people's humanity empathy  Imagine fiancee NZ. Everyday painful l quite fear rejected entry I'm unsure one ""No"" means permanent no. benefits vaccine far outweigh risks, includes immunosuppressed patients .

So, FAIL. transition masking unvaccinated vaccinated choose to,” King County Health Officer Dr. Jeff Duchin said Twitter. “For now, continue what’s worked us everyone masking indoor public spaces get disease rates lower, people vaccinated community county plans diverge direction state taking, Duchin labeled “an unfortunate consequence botched CDC rollout guidance,” drawn criticism lack clarity properly enforce different standards vaccinated unvaccinated people.

Cookouts would outside studies showed outdoor spread negligible. know, right? mention evident fact Reddit loves overlook every job world based sitting front computer 7 hours many jobs doable home (or doable terrible way, like teachers) could truly close normal months.

I'm tomorrow, yo. 

So glad made snap decision get jabbed 5 weeks ago. expect abrupt reopening. still don’t everyone wanted kids away them. think made saddest course thing. Imagine kid hearing garbage math hard parents NEEDED break. Elementary math takes two minutes learn online imagine kid finding parents dislike much loudly announce send place set like prison getting anyone actual prison. kids tuff deal better someone truly rooting person copy schedule.  Getting virus long term studies lifelong side effects may make dumber. 

Especially people getting medium term brain issues (memory issues, brain fog) seem stopping anytime soon. physical issues (lungs fucked, permanent heart damage, strokes). 

Or call fake way. FYI: investigating effect mRNA booster shots viral vector vaccine, vice versa. Results seem promising far.  That’s interesting. Maybe that’s it. kind get feeling it’s personal decision though. impossible, unless vaccinated people severely misinformed effective vaccines are. mention respiratory pathogens also want get wearing mask help reduce risk of...

Not mention allergies...

Not mention one see faces make say something stupid I'm wearing mask... kids young vaccinated. really kind playing fire hoping people going actually abide recommendations, people vaccinated begin removing masks indoor situations,” virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen told KIRO Radio’s Gee &amp; Ursula Show Tuesday. “Unfortunately, that’s probably going always case also don’t type system available verifying somebody’s vaccine status.” many people still wear masks area? I'm Central Pennsylvania

Im Pike County everyone required. take mine Im store. I'm also waiting see wider spread within UK like. lot recent numbers due local spread within large, high population density families close people brought strain back india. spread could still slow meets wider population almost there. 80% weeks less no? Nobody wants again. Let's right done this! think BC around 60% now. Get cases down, vaccines arms, open up. California incorrect example. singular focus preventing many coronavirus deaths possible, yeah, opening schools bad idea. However, improves learning environment many kids, may worthwhile endeavor. past examples reduction antibody level leading loss immunity - reductions greater 4x. vaccines WAY overengineered, serious drop level antibodies retaining immunity. We’re seeing antibody decay similar rate SARS 3 year half life. Cant blame this. huge quality life improvement. lot people want remain worried five day grind coming back. high metrics matter more, total deaths cases. look initial surge allowed delayed response densely populated states, Texas done terribly worse most. top 5 worst states even get bad summer 2020 late 2020, entirely preventable. try simplify things fit narrative, really honest broski Seems like lack oxygen major factor. crazy tot think something like run out. Society sucked covid, desperate go back? kind I'm at. get death tragic, risk kids seem high enough modify behavior. I'm vaccinated, family vaxed vaxed. ones left little ones, risk low, we're starting go back normal life again. sure AP rule following headline avoid litigious battles… Oh yea, zero amusement picky eating thing, thats tragic. I'm sorry deal that. really wonder coming fall winter go though. 

I feel like might spike cases, **not massively concerning amount** vaccines, may get unvaccinated people hold out. knew seeing really remarkable declines hospitalization symptomatic illness related possibly Covid, high immunization rate, would probably fine going without mask, see happening anytime real soon

Did lady slip coma May 2020 wake yesterday? fit every single criteria listed. post Flair? ""Government""? Government? commenter told completely unnecessary fear-mongering, way. information and/or time passed, likelihood one virus ""adapt humans cause another pandemic"" slim none. Wrong. They're longer requiring masks **vaccinated** states approved measure. difference they're checking vaccination status. Stop spreading lies. Agree 100%. enough vaccines world end year. would mRNA technology lived socialism. Capitalism wins again. also, Ontario refusing open reach 80% vaccinated, that’s motivation.

I really like approach - anyone bitches lockdown, look straight eye ask they've got vaccine yet.

If haven't, tell PROBLEM rollout almost stopped entirely. know sudden !!

Vaccines doses trickling hospitals. literally go hospital hospital get vaccine parents.
Now car, saw many elderly folk travelled far buses turned back. Day day could see sad old men women center. Turned away. know right? state threw huge unworkable mess hands poor minimum wage workers trying survive America. topic, least hundreds coronaviruses circling world today. way observations like interpreted unnecessary fear, already seen comments below. single spillover absolutely call ""if virus continues adapt human hosts become another pandemic disease"".  someone medical condition (allergy) prevents getting vaccine? denied service? strongly disagree joke part. statewide mandate came early lifted relatively early. came time lot data missing regards transmission, numbers rising. 

It also targeted broadly problem opposed specific picture would obviously safe... single household distanced beach. actual reality many beaches peak use lots people taking public transport car-pooling, people interacting close proximity outside, bathrooms, concessions, etc...

The state beach closures also part state park closures (again opened early) gave officials time implement safeguards specific location. Again, may seem simple think single household isolated beach park field, reality state park systems fairly complex differ needed put safeguards place.

It right call time given known time situation facing, especially regarding masks. We're point covid risks becoming marginal restrictions less justifiable every day. 

I suspect push get kids back school due realization attempting save covid via closing in-person school would doom millions falling behind developmentally and/or academically ways easy get back from. 

I lot folks circles want stay locked long covid spreading. I'm officially point agree people saying ""If scared, stay home. tell do."" entire time now. 

We're lucky vaccines nearly best-case scenario terms effectiveness allows us vaccinated personally fear consequences others' actions like used to. deep love Japanese culture... emphasis restraint, deliberation, consensus tends make crisis response quite cumbersome slow. couple recent cases illustrate this:

*The Toyota recall based spontaneous acceleration (that actually exist!)

*The Fukushima disaster response 

They incredible expertise, technology, infrastructure, etc. culture makes nimble action problem emerges quite difficult. Unfortunately, difficulties associated vaccine rollout unexpected. saw it. And? think people would actively distance beaches group friends family?

Okay bud.

It statistically removing chance equation spreading. certainly helped mild inconvenience anyone us living here. Relax, know talking about. Nope what? likely went high range someone would come attacking coment. Either way, \~30% infected + 50% vaccine (even though much likely overlap) leads high amount immunity. much I've shit US terrible job handling covid, wish best hope end cases drop good. world really needs go back normal hopefully stay there. Ok think even right whole summer think that. Cases deaths going low summer regardless many vaccines given. Ya, clear example old adage money corrupts. There's nothing wrong concept even IOC corrupt hell. angry phone calls demanding follow CDC clogging Murphy's answering machine? hope so. “To ask employees enforce mask mandate new conditions verify vaccine status door escalate confrontations communities simply realistic,” said Amanda Dalton, president Northwest Grocery Association, represents 300 chain community grocers across Oregon. “We’re aware state today taking card-check approach CDC Fred Meyer said Thursday continue require masks response Oregon’s new guidance, despite parent company, Kroger, suspending mask requirements elsewhere Oregon’s Enchanted Forest amusement park announced Monday would delay reopening plans people responded threats angry comments decision continue require Dalton said heard family grocer Central Oregon well said employees threatened quit way treated customers trying enforce state’s new mask “The revised OHA guidance doesn’t provide choice businesses,” Dalton panelists said businesses remain worried could open litigation asking customers’ health information remain confused effectively implement state’s wondered businesses supposed stop customers showing fake vaccination cards simply taking masks entering. Others wanted know whether state expected businesses store customers’ vaccination information force customers verify vaccination status every time shop. Letting unvaccinated go unmasked breaking cdc guidance. damn sucks homey business refuse service unvaccinated person medical religious exemption? seems like way people could undermine requirements Said COVID-19 Positivity rate surge high doubt. think masks didn’t help keep number lower would been? realize covid spreading mostly btwn people wearing masks. People gather together without masks. mask mandate doesn’t mean people wear masks inside homes gather other. 
Also may feel safe next umasked vaccinated person guidelines know person vaccinated people could lie it. Sounds like Oregon needs get every state's program then! mean science?  employers refuse hire unvaccinated person medical religious exemption? seems like way people could undermine requirements unfortunate anti-maskers vitriolic. Trust randos, CDC?

hmm CDC advice unvaccinated need stay masked. Kids less risk, risk. Covid still kill them.

Vaccination something works best level herd - knocking Covid transmission low levels, like measles. everyone vaccinated early age, like measles, passed this.

Unfortunately people unbelievably actually *want* Covid spread. completely clear causing 'brain-rot', possible causes 1) sort nasty survival fittest philosophy. 2) back justification (or do) pandemic. 3) Fear collective action may effective, also sometimes essential. science? Nope. Every single person saw flight wearing mask correctly. amazing people suddenly realize put mask nose hundreds dollars line. would nice workplaces, even without pandemic, start instituting staggered approach, staggered work home days possible. Excuse blunt attitude reason mess first place. lot people running around complaining rights death rate groups low time spreading virus killing older risk people. people taken thing seriously first place instead deciding risk tolerances death rate would much much lower impact economy everyday lives much less severe.   Absolutely this! used try logic, facts, calm persuasion get people board giving crap. 'How interesting, show source? I'd love send data that. willing give look?' go to. thing though, live coastal town heavy tourism. freaking people SWARMED TOWN wear masks 'It's much safer here, worry Covid all!' literally care coming high risk locations bringing germs along spreading around! ended burning rage turned apathy anyone dumb care Covid now. long let think innocent people exposed willful ignorance, hope get obviously asking for. saying taking steroids mild comfort conditions could come temporarily, get vaccinated, similar levels protection? certainly did

Did see word distanced? Sure seem like did. Western Australia, keep method thanks.
I prefer premier’s approach reach herd immunity. close friend excitedly telling plans host first birthday party daughter vaccinated friends well. sounded like wanted people bring vaccine cards proof felt little extreme whatever, celebrate baby think much it.

 
Anyway, mom groups social media sound awful-- reshared really poorly-written blog posts MIS-C greatly overstated risk fatality disease. shut idea party (which going outdoors, less!) posting they're considering socializing *vaccinated* people daughter vaccinated.  definitely stopped people gathering cars drive beach unmasked. 

But also early pandemic. also 10x population vaccinate people. Percentage relevant raw number. scared CA going allow vaccinated people go maskless businesses businesses could prove it. looking like CA way happening huge event. stores protected hours anymore, willing offer curbside services either.

I seen substantial stores offering curbside pickup services. Places like Walmart, Target still offer that, least areas good vaccine coverage.

Everyone wants vaccine capable getting vaccine today outside kids age 12. can't offer accommodations like continued work home, zoom access meetings, shifted work hours avoid crowded times, shifting work duties public-facing roles, safe place eat drink work/school? immuncompromised person needs speak pharmacist, ask expect pharmacist wear mask? service worker home?

Why can't immunocompromised people take necessary steps protect instead expecting others change accommodate them?

You're going need substantially better justification ""why can't that?"" think that's good idea. protections individuals use protect families COVID-19. make sure workers ability get vaccinated want try hard convince don’t. workers opportunity get vaccinated (and many places easy get them) compliance won’t matter. pretty simple don’t see continue argue it. convo workers able access shots that’s whole point I’m sympathetic to. part discourse people anxiety handful cherry picked scientists likely mad didn’t get invited panel Idk, seem call variants countries first discovered. would agree stupid use B.xx nomenclature also call B.1.1.7 British variant (at least outside UK) would racism that, would it?  uk variant Brazil variant news months back . easier remember bundle random numbers letters. Russia? talks Reddit alcohol vaccine compatibility Russia announced vaccine months ago. never really gained traction got forgotten about. Brazilian variant, UK variant.. one cares poor UK.. Ignorance bliss. Governor saying June 15 awhile now. 1 month Vaccine opened 11 year olds 2 months opened adults. enough time get lot people partially vaccinated even 2 weeks past second shot. not.  means French variant now? yeah revealing - word thats people learn dehumanise workplace order get things done. Black people hesitant get vaccine, every metric. seem weird complaining white people? kid's school requires proof covid-19 vaccination like many vaccination, ?? unvaccinated want infect other, problem. I'm done making sacrifices. point shingles big problem. shingles byproduct chicken pox shingles one. could byproduct Covid, similar byproduct Covid, something much serious. know. sterility byproduct? highly unlikely point idea long term consequences thing seems absurd take unnecessary risks. mean schools go back. might mean kids need wear masks, ventilation needs adequately addressed, etc. also Japan’s approach early semi lockdown. also starting see interesting plans go action boost vaccinations like giving people money, lotteries scholarships. think programs boosts need keep vaccination numbers up. U.S. official said that, arrangement EU, Washington prioritising requests EU manufacturers approved vaccines, CureVac, yet win EU authorisation, would priority companies earlier-stage vaccine candidates.

Given production backlog raw materials, makes sense prioritize raw materials vaccines already approved CureVac reaches stage. “May” Right? spokesperson's words along lines ""we're saddened happened workplace.""

🙁

Those **people**, buildings, died. sure mean “a nonevent kids”. One study last year found one five 18-34 year olds contracted SARS-CoV-2 ended intensive care death rates similar rest population. young adults younger children though, long term impact even mild asymptomatic infection somewhere unknown troubling. Neurological damage, long term (maybe permanent) damage lungs &amp; hearts, apparently damage overall immune function “non-events” anyone suffers them, younger start greater long-term potential suffering. 

We likely won’t know full impact years, early investigations indicate lasting symptoms may occurring third everyone infected—including plenty people whose initial infection mild weren’t aware they’d COVID-19 future problems cropped up. Many stores protected hours anymore, willing offer curbside services either.

Not areas good vaccine coverage.

Why can't offer accommodations like continued work home, zoom access meetings, shifted work hours avoid crowded times, shifting work duties public-facing roles, safe place eat drink work/school? immuncompromised person needs speak pharmacist, ask expect pharmacist wear mask? service worker home? UK government gives us like 4 months notice (all assuming lockdown vaccines went predicted) I’ve working gym maskless month (since fully vaccinated) along 95% people there.  issues COViD. vaccine worked me. He's wrong though.  86 year old father one remaining targets. Won’t get vaxxed won’t careful. :-( 

I’ll hard time feeling sorry gets — still will. He’s Dad. :-( NJ Gov Murphy announce Monday removal masks prior MDW. Finally! They’re trying wring last good noodle points covid True, everyone called racist China position. nobody cares use word ""Indian"" referring variant. Huh, wonder why? definitely reasoning work place. spacing employees desks. matter June 15th they're going care us can't keep working shift. closing beaches butt jokes forever.

Lol, I’m sure rolling bed waltzing laptop PJs two minutes work starts able goof day nice. certainly school. wants get ready hour early commute we’ve lounging home year half? 

The pandemic created lot laziness people understandably unwilling let go. less do, less want do. Returning life going tough transition lot folks, I’m willing bet feel better afterwards. Lies? talking underreporting include US too. 1. extraordinarily unlikely going catch COVID fully vaccinated.
2. Unless using heavy duty mask like N95 mask (which would awful work with), mask likely make massive difference protection. Social distancing effective protection standard cloth mask. popular topic conversation. get jab that’s if. End story. Yet everyone feels need drone it. really absolutely idea why. always funny seeing people reddit talk various media outlets saying know people getting news reddit filter.

Plenty things get posted reddit do, hit front page sub.

Just see X media outlet, mean also P, Q, R. could unknown long term effects AZ vaccine too. way knowing. 

All base risk what's known. That... that’s dunning Krueger effect vaccine safe, getting vaccine serves greater good. literally nothing wrong required get vaccine. also wear mask barely even inconvenience you’re dumbass anti vaxxer True, burn house forest fire way less concern.

US handle COVID well.... Totally disconnected reality. really, no. I'm completely burned investing time energy people refuse take basic precautions protect others. none business, specifically introduce conversation? know even bothered responding even understand original post. hydroxychloroquine finally kicking in!  circle infinitely changes it’s angle goes around. never changed thing. did. Wrong again. Keep going though. fun. Well US also lot natural immunity well also contributes herd immunity. context drug development, industry. new mRNA technology would exist huge profit incentive ..having 10x population presents much logistical problems. 

They've zero problems logistics. demand higher America problem giving 4.6 MILLION doses day. That's higher day Canada adjusting population.

Demand vaccine fallen States, per day numbers slipped result. never said changed statement, seem know circular argument is. 

This actually is: claim title bullshit think ""may have"" bullshit. ""Ads raising awareness interest""

""We accomplished goal raising awareness interest""

""It's ad""

Okay, mate. Guessing haven’t read article then? issue whether get EU, it’s US won’t allow back lower before, mean 30k lot.

Never gonna get banned

I'ma get vax planned

My ass, kiss say I'm wrong. says people susceptible bribery, well known phenomenon. That’s irrelevant, isn’t discrimination it’s public health issue. again, already require vaccinations children attend public school country. want attend public gathering worst pandemic hundred years, don’t surprised require you’re vaccinated. think healthcare right profit center? may bad sounds. another 37% infected, they're 70%, commonly cited level herd immunity. number unrealistic situation.

Besides, rolling 1.3 billion vaccines tough. Give try believe me. top grade hyperbole.

Every country creates 2 (or more) classes whole plethora things. Licensure....whether drivers' licenses professional licensing start. Political parties. Literally protected classes EEOC........ I'm sure keep going here. believe you. believe plenty Republicans straw manning place crazier crazier lies, like troll. example three involved parties. 
The employer, employee, medical facility. 
This would work; check discussed specifically employer employee. 
The assumption employee would asked employer able answer directly vaccinated not. 
No need even involve medical facility, party legally bound HIPAA. 
So, case data come place patient; comes directly you. 

Hospitals hide behind HIPAA; face severe punishment abiding it.  
I surprised hospital staff refused talk ANYTHING related patient care. 
It would meant immediate dismissal job, potentially even ruined chances ever work medical field again. 
I know someone fired small slip shared another unrelated employee super obscure piece information tied patient care person fired. 
She lucky enough got second chance find new hospital set back lot career. 

HIPAA joke, people rightfully usually extremely respectful medical field. 
It simply exist outside though. Pretty much same..( sigh) low Facebook set bar? really see problem all, actually. example, made company makes drug cures cancer, able make money that? would spend however many millions dollars development human trials going philanthropic effort? Recommended outdoor events, required indoor events 5000. problem mostly people valley trying beat heat hit beach central coast. Gosh forbid world wide pandemic requiring masks mess beach day. Uhg. would true verification vaccination status happening, isn't. way tell vaccinated, incentive person chooses get vaccinated want wear mask so. government scientists ones advocating vaccines masks? according Chinese sources, Chinese vaccines lack efficacy, especially variants. means many use Chinese vaccines may need Western booster shot next year.

Yeah kidding, one choice Pfizer Sinopharm brainer. problem is, one Pfizer except selected countries, equally, important vaccine accessible. BTW Chinese vaccines offer good protection hospitalization deaths, vaccine good Chinese vaccine exports used geopolitical aims. Ie. political price.

As is? Seems like prioritize countries hold trials vaccines totally understandable. Otherwise, want buy it, buy it. OBGYN told people contact newborn need whooping cough booster shot? disease making comeback low childhood vaccination / adult booster rates. Kills lots little ones able get vaccinated themselves.

I’m anti-vaxxer, im gonna get it”. “So you’re anti-vax, not?” 

“I think I’ll survive it... ...gotta vaccinate kids border though!”

O_0 Yeah... good luck surviving it. already covid afraid get either 🤷🏻‍♀️ what?

The EU announced reopening plans, means US workers tourists get go.

Plans things future. immaterial whether go right now. way! Go on… That's lot cases.

It 70,000 cases/day month ago 250,000 cases/day January. like letting everyone else work them, thinking protect them. Except people work production literally cannot work home.

They saying:

*never waste good crisis* Well, “there aren’t many them” exactly defense people, it? Flat earthers may few, doesn’t mean aren’t stupid shouldn’t criticized.

We 20s. go cdc guidelines? ya.... indoors thing iffy me. quarter work vaccine hesitant lot stupid people still don’t understand shit virus info need. least people work take virus seriously... yeah much influence could vaccine hesitancy =\ Literally put wallet lmaoo carry around drivers license never made argument. simply pointed bullshitness article title. makes argument me. going exactly? problem easy solution. mean, kind common get questioned whether vaccinated not. basic example wedding I'm going hold - people vaccinated counted limits, kind forced ask whether vaccinated not...  imagine arguments right privacy body autonomy fall deaf ears consider this: ever time country provided legal basis create 2 classes hasnt exploited racists? correct, but:  
- virus particular problematic people huge range symptoms, including symptoms. testing many people possible way go. It’s like, dunno, appendicitis skilled clinicians get really good noticing symptoms tests confirmatory rather exploratory. 
- low % positive *plus* lower total daily infections means things getting better likely aren’t many undiagnosed cases. 
- Even daily cases sky high doctors hypothetically “over-tested skew %positive low” that’s still good thing least would know aren’t unreported cases hiding. use AZ vaccine widely used throughout Europe.

I never said reduce risk, question degree cost. 18 fully vaccinated vs 32 weren't, 1 passed fully vaccinated, two passed not. Obviously suggests level reduced risk, statistically numbers much lower 95% effectiveness truly accurate.

At least warrants discussion whether risk continue socially distance wear masks even full vaccination. But, unfortunately we're allowed discussions ask questions due people like yourself. That's water bridge, mate, none business besides. Well hard private companies creating solutions tragedy. Obviously BioNTech's stock price going go finish making vaccine, anyone stock company profit result I've taken pandemic seriously entire time. Socially distanced, always wore mask etc etc. chose get vaccinated.

And I'm anti vax, I've plenty I'm sure more. getting one. Yeah, response repetitive argument. good news waiting 12 weeks doses leads better immune system response. Same. I'm hopping sometimes bother. actually general internet thing. look non-political feel good YouTube videos still dislikes it. Reddit also negative times. internet provides shied people negative wanna be. put way, mean we're another surge. Strange work vaccine mentioned post. mask forever people distrust them? dropped mask mandate 2 months ago.

But none retail stores Texas did. Dumbest regulation entire pandemic Also people vaccine isnt likely effective on. dad vaccinated finished chemo weeks vaccinated. chemo half lung removed pandemic. dying go back favorite resturants (honestly something wasnt sure would ever get see 6 months ago) COULD....except number unvaccinated still high risk isnt worth it. COVID numbers getting better every week despite everything reopening. look stuff yourself. Mario say that?? Profiting pandemic. Specifically amassing huge wealth tragedy. well...

People lost minds. chance near Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,

If might need not, sorry... friends, fully vaccinated, get together park play soccer without mask real risk? come laugh overly paranoid people.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC.

/s ""overly paranoid"" worrying governor finally follow states relaxing mask mandate new CDC guidance? Immunocompromised people wearing n95 masks limiting contact, true even pandemic.

My state contact tracing every case haven’t one single case linked transmission another kid. It’s incredibly incredibly rare. They’re much likely catch regular flu, didn’t stop travel flu.

My whole family fully vaccinated places don’t require it, don’t wear mask anymore. chances catching spreading covid minuscule according cdc. low might well nonexistant. 

If daughter comorbidity, makes sense. That’s asking.

People fully vaccinated still wearing masks aren’t really helping anyone. It’s worse, it’s really better either. That’s cdc said return normal activities. make sound sinister! government want independent vaccine supply?

I see like loss-leader AZ. Sure might make much money, AZ vaccine manufacturer - one move they've suddenly become one famous vaccine producers world. Might lead fat contracts line bad PR dies down.  Yes, fact it’s promoted them. That’s right. RNA inherently stable. many biological preparations (quite often lab preparations one aiming isolate RNA), thought highly susceptible degradation enzymatic proteins - “RNAses“) - rightly said, depends source. Well done old chap Saaaame. likely. believe Paul Offit, do, knows stuff viruses vaccines, invented pretty impressive number vaccines, would take couple years virus mutate enough escape current vaccines, case, push booster really quickly even comes point, doesn’t think will. diminishing number potential hosts people getting vaccine natural immunity makes mutation less likely. Politically lockdown question least anyway. However case numbers longer interesting honestly never were.

The relevant number daily hospitalisations unfortunately lags behind 3+ weeks.

The reason relevant measure consistent start pandemic factors everything - including new vaccines may allow cases cases end needing hospitalisation. kids smarter adays calling bullshit. grew google, wiki, etc. way better looking facts opinions navigating them. good em. boomers hand cant tell opinions facts. generations mix researching facts. BC variant politely infects people. 70-75 percent efficacy symptomatic infection. bad great. Totally agree. people want keep distance protect that's them. feel dirty looks unwarranted since CDC pretty clear guidance vaccinated people. Understandably, think bad experiences vaccines past make people hesitant. said, need vaccinate essential workers. Damn. “science” CDC says?

It's funny many times heard antimaskers antivaxxers :) MJ I’m mom I’ would make sense think read people explain something contracts planned use space after...and like, fact athletes competing sports also run yearly schedule making logistical pain ass. apparently easier said done. vaccination cite got almost 1500 kids first weekend age restrictions lowered! It’s awesome see turn out! never disputed effectiveness vaccines, genuinely sorry autoimmune diseases impacting life. sister one, affected significantly. I'm really even trying change opinion, stating I'm glad continue wearing mask reduce even small risk unvaccinated children. live Georgia, think change impacts hesitancy much all, seeing many refused wear mask without vaccine, also gladly accept things may different are, could incentive there. hope works encourage reluctant, believe will.

However, would ask reflect opening saying know 38 people infected vaccination? Make sure CDC knows group! number breakthrough infections vaccination severe enough cause hospitalization tiny.

It comes across condescending sarcastic, really sure hoped achieve saying it. constructive helpful discussion, rather insensitive, given six people mentioned would still alive COVID-19. friend lost dad, shared birthday. Another age leaves behind widow two children. died shortly group eligible vaccination. 

I respond further, hope consider human behind keyboard future. healthy discuss compare different opinions, I've found better chance achieving mutual understanding remaining kind conversations.

It’s complicated today, it’s quickly changing I’m happy that! get pandemic ASAP. vaccinate young children? Yeah mean, Japan still fails admit war atrocities (ie: killing 6,000 Koreans blaming Earthquake) mean...not surprising saving face here. seem hard time admitting fault, general. bureaucracy slow AF outdated. Wearing mask isn’t ever a-scientific. It’s choice make reduces chance catching airborn viruses (whether covid one not). Demanding people wear mask unnecessarily might unscientific people deciding wear mask, Hence go businesses clearly marked mask-optional vaccinated people. Chipotle, Starbucks, Mariano's (subsidiary Kroger) made announcements (and post signs) masks optional vaccinated people.  Gotcha, makes much sense. Exactly. That's problem India. shut fast good first round, little natural immunity, opened super fast, situation...same deal Czech Republic + Poland, well first wave terribly 2nd time around people started thinking fake special genes shit. Oh Chipotle, eh? hospital work several outbreaks nurses refused vaccine. someone still wears mask stores nothing spiting anyone. Nothing wrong wanting minimize danger. I’m fun shopping anyway issue wearing mask. I’m going wear beach fun stuff I’m around people busy store, not? rules optional, like (as long you’re sick obviously coughing/sneezing). though? feel like Japanese take forever change anything, even outdated rules. seem follow rules purpose following them. want make comparisons feel like games China Korea, would this. much dislike Chinese government, can't deny would literally used army vaccinate everyone, to. CDC guidance says it’s fine keep masks even you’re vaccinated it’s entirely business local authorities mandate not.  Also Chicago, think wary anti-maskers lives going live vaccinations.

So wear mask around wrist. someone looks uneasy, pop on, harm foul. especially since many medical professionals publicly stated CDC organize advice reasonable manner takes consideration many people going live spread Covid around.  soccer allowed park? mean, trust white man first small pox run. I'd get vaccinated ASAP too, native. “science” CDC says? case keeping mask fine. it’s required mass transit everyone. worth, still get vaccine yet, [it's shown alleviate symptoms ""long sizeable portion recipients. ultimately work way. Whether they’re delivering mRNA instructions spike protein spike protein stuck harmless virus, they’re producing basically immune response. take longer others, it’s end point.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* attempt justify ridiculous reasoning keeping everything shut down. patiently waiting provincial government talking anything remotely like this... way see it, used send kid daycare, parks, indoor playgrounds unmasked eating snacks benches prior COVID. risk RSV statistically much worse young kids (killing 30k year) always rare change behavior. even knew friend kid hospitalized back 2017. Meanwhile death COVID kids 17 around 300 millions infected deaths causes 44,000+. It’s even lower kids 5. relative absolute risk COVID specifically worth worrying about. still allow vaccinated people house take precautions, I’m worried getting it. risk dying probably similar fully vaccinated adult dying it— extremely rare. Time move on. said getting vaccine enrolled volunteers Pfizer trial, though doubt selected given cases area days. tighten pandemic lockdown measures combat severe second COVID-19 wave, President Alberto Fernandez said Thursday, underscoring concern daily cases deaths broken records last week. Fernandez also announced economic rescue package sectors worst-hit pandemic, exacerbated crisis plagued country past three years left millions Argentines poverty. People wearing face masks wait line tested coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Colon Theatre, Buenos Aires, Argentina April 13, 2021. Yeaaah, freshman year college. Nothing like watching CNN seeing future dorm (Mayflower) flooding real time. open fall semester, though. technically go places maskless now. gym doesn’t require show vaccine card upon entry. Working mask horrible. Going grocery store one annoying, deal little longer. According Twitter, yes. I'm surprised surprises anyone. guy clearly worried health before. would change now? case mortality rate COVID-19 United States 1.8%. That's far off. Look UK, like 1/5th population along first doses still 2k cases day, that's equivalent US 10k cases day, get we'd probably need 70%+ whole US population vaccinated, though I'm speculating. im 14 im suspicious get it. thinking getting august something Also true. Lotteries actually way efficient basically every outreach program, states don’t appears unethical/unreasonable. Ohio opened flood gates plenty states happy hop on. Economists long advocated use state lotteries things like this.  schools ask vaccination status, even 2020, it’s HIPAA-related. wrote governor yesterday asking implement lottery area live subpar vaccination rates. hope listens. already case, sadly. middle management needs butts seats else upper management see middle management isn’t really needed likely job. Why? phrasing article ""improved outreach literally conceivable way get vaccine hesitant minority communities vaccinated""? Generally handing money solution government consider one people discuss, mean government willing discussion non-monetary means improve uptake embarassing. really excited see many students received first dose. 

But local paper also reported 2,000 people failed appear second dose appointment! Gah. Yeah could see sure. Aside anxiety around unmasked potentially unvaccinated people without vaccinated others mentioned CDC also corrected misinformation vaccines serving prevent severe illness death, preventing transmission.

Not everyone country self-centered asshole. could see caring types volunteer time helping people regularly getting vaccine young healthy don’t consider risk dying Covid, choosing realized could save someone else’s life.   predict zero percent chance happening point bribes become medically unethical? people chanted ""follow science"" last month, yes. seems fair me. assume nurses seen covid-19 done communities watched many individuals die. think case politics trumping science based decision making common sense. see work /u/looktowindward! actually really exciting gives lot hope “antivaxxers” quietly taking shot, FB posts CDC cards, showing bandaid shoulders, etc, matters they’re getting it. Nobody reasonable told asking vaccination violates HIPPA. also said violates Federal Lobster Fishing Regulations either.

What heard ADA generally prohibits businesses employers requiring disclose medical history service employment. sound mostly right. example, fried chicken place refuse serve someone indicate treated HIV. feels like that's illegal, be.

COVID-19 different, suspect, precisely unclear lay person. heard little vaccinated people hospitals it’s working! I’m sure effective new variants though. could good too.

I imagine people like healthcare workers especially could better vaccine prevents lot spread infection, given deal lot sick people. recurring symptoms Pfizer vaccine? received 2nd shot Sunday, felt mild fever like symptoms. Today Thursday similar symptoms severe added stomach cramps lack appetite. money food poisoning I'm curious anyone else seen 9r experienced something similar. Thank you! try stop smoking killing many innocent people. opportunity trade places would take it? That's okay. Popularity never high list. really hope long term adverse effects. mRNAs could potentially nothing short miracle whole bunch diseases I'll watching anticipation sidelines now. Thanks conversation 😀 understanding (from Taiwanese wife) China Airlines staff reduced quarantine requirements allow continue operate international flights. supposed 3 days quarantine, 11 days isolated home. number pilots apparently (1) get vaccinated (2) skipped early 3 day isolation visit, um, mistresses, addition flaunting stay home rules going public freely.  seems sparked outbreak unfortunately. Taiwan's locked - we'll see days keep contained not.

It seems like there's politics play well, needs long explanation that's probably topic sub. EVA Air, major Taiwanese airline, issues pilots vaccinated. ^ This, 100%. acceptable death rate Covid like disease. supposed applauded?? still sad people need bribes roadblocks otherwise get vaccine motivation. 

That said I'm spending money get people vaxed here, lottery efficient way it. make sure spend money outreach programs populations lottery attract whatever methods work. Let's get shots arms! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* nephew turned 12 last week, got first dose day after. anxious get it. Ha! Imagine must trying (and weird wrinkle must otherwise joyful work!) - honestly, long shots going arms, think you/we call win. see UK decided throw measures away vaccination program going well. looks like testing remain necessary events like least couple months come. ""Where's beef?"" - Clara Peller

""Don't cow, man!"" - Bart Simpson Information breed panic. Sometimes information. sometimes journalism hold everyone accountable make sure looked vs. sweeping rug.

I'd personally rather much information little, understand everyone feels way. make panic, reassures looking everything. People side effects - fever, muscle aches, fatigue, headache seems last 24-48 hours. think misunderstanding meant. (I probably make clear)

The person way ahead science, like happened HCQ others. Nobody credible would claiming cure yet either. want general person street touting cure like HCQ proven one.

Again, good news, looks promising lets wait proper trials claim ""Covid dustbin medicine"". Argentinian here, goverment absolutely blame, mishandled situation that, spent covid money corruption nothing got done. year 3% population vaccinated. Good thing deleted account good time. already feel much better sky still falling? Slowly right. It’s getting it’s something crazy low like 5 deaths per day average last 50 days. Eventually drop cliff like cases have. It’s little month since cases plummeted I’m little surprised haven’t seen yet. real pandemic, people would need incentive get vaccine. severe cases UK strain people havent vaccinated. Even that, UK cases still incredibly low. Seychelles also used less efficacious chinese vaccine made sinophram, Ptizer/Moderna Astrozenca/J&amp;J. Yes, try talk find hard understand them.

This last year hell hearing impaired individuals. vaccinated last months reward. sir, correct! matter shouldn’t able anyway not. Yes, I'm aware Israels numbers. agree seems (!) notable. point, looked at, totally agree you. multiple explanations this: Maybe worker nursing home, contacts 100s inhabitants infected them, indeed unlucky 5%, develop resistance. Maybe particular batch vaccine unrecognized problem cooling chain turned bad. Maybe person responsable particular nursing home made human error thee vaccination process. maybe weird variant slighter higher vaccine resistance. one endless possibilities, I'm panicking yet.

In end, I'm saying is: Yes, look it. maybe print article, looked it, contains relevant information instead printing beforehand lack context content. ...but US citizens tourists outside EU? Nah, 12-year-olds given free Fortnite items. candy men waiting younger children become eligible. Walmarts Costcos etc., fire immunocompromised employees, leave unprotected, protect requiring proof immunization customers go maskless? that's vaccinated choosing take risk

Realistically, people infected already. might slight bump Fall another wave happening. started daycare 4 year old late March. lucky CA cases lowest levels since start pandemic lowest states. Felt okay take risk home day long winter. Got really bad frustrated home. didn’t feel like sending taking chance getting covid family either. daycare shut 2-3 instances last year account someone related positive case. always scare even sent last summer finally decided couldn’t take scares anymore pulled last fall. restarted March

On another note kid learnt speak 3. mom tells learnt around time. laminated mine Kinkos turn offer? assume bad intention others offer options? topic. hundreds coronaviruses circulating among non-human animals, stoke fear. got sick twice year like everyone else, duh. 'survival', getting sick sucks I'd like avoid pointless illnesses on. Gonna interesting variant starts tearing unvaxxed populations, young old. places 5-10% population documented case covid. even enough sustain business? order precious people business show paperwork positive test (but long ago could reinfected) subsequent negative test (or multiple negative tests avoid false negative?). Seems like huge headache wouldn’t worth wouldn’t done correctly safely me. would guess may see something low 400-500 daily average deaths soon

The 7 day moving average daily deaths 573. Going 500 would put us level March 30,2020. necessarily call ""end"" pandemic US, pretty close. Sounds like states can't due state laws (this brought MI gov today). May NY. Turn Fox News Exactly concern. Covid unlike flu new disease. much known long term effects. People suffered polio back day sometimes got post polio syndrome parts body lost function spite negative actual virus. Sometimes long term complications showed several years later. way knowing happen Covid really data far future.  watch blood come blood draw moment needle actually pierces vein. Link original source. 13 year old first shot today. got shot adults life much higher risk reason hesitant, even though means can’t see children. 

These kids committed getting normal life back. There’s still much don’t know, I’m willing risk getting kid sick. What’s big deal?  Avoid reposting information, please. Yes it’s really shocking scary parent child isn’t vaccinated yet. Even greedy CEOs getting impatient getting lot us workers privilege working remotely back office. least bothered schools open and/or kids vaccinated not. Yes, 3 weeks first one :P think confusion non-vaccinated people, since CDC saying still wear masks. Lotteries different putting billboard running ad NBA game. 

They promotion get people talking vaccine, going getting vaccine.

Places Africa absolutely need outreach advertising vaccine reaches there. say 100% people entire freaking continent totally going take vaccine without advertisement outreach completely false. Assuming guys fully vaccinated - already back normal grandchildren? Vaccines 100% protection serious symptoms covid lmao ever fucking survive rest existence covid. Pathetic. Lottery tickets really cheap. get one time. allow op-eds/commentaries. I'm New York venues planning fully open requiring proof vaccination want attend. pointless masks? wow wtf wrong you?  Avoid reposting information, please. edited titles, please. Well proves it’s fairly fucking pointless one TBH mask mandate ending probably make much difference. I'm NY mandate ended yesterday 99% people still wearing masks kind indoor public area. seemed hasty. think point science supports 'you need mask time public vaccinated' valid. BUT... think 2 steps ahead, meaning, take account anti maskers/anti vaxxers simply take advantage new suggestion lie vaccinated go maskless. now, basically everyone ditching masks 50% population vaccineted. Good post OP  “Sir, one shot one booster shot. Please stop coming back every week enter. “ Taiwan good job countries thinking could covid zero forever fools errand Yes, growing developing. example alcohol consumption cause kids development suffer, fully grown adults seem experience significant side effects reasonable consumption. Astrazenica? happens we’re fucked vaccinated would still spread vaccinated vaccine would useless don’t see point CDC needs continuously publish many hospitalized Covid patients vaccinated vs unvaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let number talking.  

* ""Get Antibody Vaccine""
* ""Get Antibody Covid - pass friends, families possible long stay Hospital $$$$$$ them"". Unfortuantely, think around due people hesitant getting vaccinated. Yikes. guys really trying censor place like crazy. Glad left already. Hopefully learn civil discourse actually stop shutting people anti-bot anti-shilling. Better safe sorry. Yes, guy know rides motorcycle flip-flops believed, masks don’t work, I’m torn here... already given thoughtless remarks far much attention. Done. Well. goal change ppl’s life. It’s get ppl vaccinated thatsthejoke.mp4 even complicated, like far know there's nothing stopping healthcare provider telling someone ""yeah today treated someone whose leg got chopped chainsaw accident."" say ""yeah today treated 30 year old white male lives ZIP code XYZ works ABC Corp"" that's pretty likely violation, say ""yeah today treated Joe Sixpack"" that's clearly violation. states way still excess death threshold compare Florida (way above) Wisconsin (way below) example 
 
 
  
select ""Excess deaths without COVID-19""  
click ""update dashboard""  
then select state drop list That's... literally opposite policy... Sure can. purge non-compliant. lives saved would worth it. really make sense big question food provided Africans..they literally sitting diamonds struggling eat everyday live huts.  Lack antibiotics must surely huge difference treating coinfection compared pandemic. Let specific: Trial participants registered FDA. cases infectious disease whatever would report numbers CDC. 

This SOP. US incredibly robust vaccine system seen. really. US actually giving Central America next. plan always export. get situation India right now. Mexico already received 1st couple shipments Pfizer US. Mexico's case, contract have, US big incentive vaccinate Central American countries next, well Nobody cares think righty million dollar prize involved??!! ok honest question even give kids vaccine? understand barely shows symptoms people 20 Probably flu vaccine available everyone 6 months. case Covid. I'm NY. went grocery store first time today since mask mandate lifted 99% people still wearing masks. three people entire store wearing masks one yelling people dairy aisle. mRNA vaccines seem way quicker build immunity. 

As side effects / subjective feelings, I've heard people similar common reactions either case. know hard stats -- J&amp;J takers know side effects like fatigue, confirm possibility. 

I Moderna. First shot nothing, arm soreness. Second shot leveled 24 hours, residual feelings 12 hours, back normal that. fun breathing people's spit getting sick twice year then. rest us embarassingly healthy.  want purple stuuuuufffff  I'm actually less worried small business owners. small business owner, since 2006. Small business owners already assume tons risk.

I'm thinking Walmarts Costcos grocery chains. ""donated sold favorable price"" original article. Even loan case cited, option receiving country have. options always good. alternatives ""buy cash"", ""sorry, getting vaccine"". One UK experts even said earlier year we're going accept there's certain level daily COVID deaths nothing mitigate like flu move well reasoned hypothesis.

The data large support overwhelming majority COVID deaths seen vulnerable populations death completely unexpected event (I.e. old infirm). COVID likely consolidated deaths time hospitals, nursing homes, elderly care facilities, etc. at-risk population much smaller, non-COVID deaths would expected happening right aren’t happening — already happened last year. vaccine scheduling work UK? NHS send postcard email something telling go? sceience people choosing wear masks? Yep, lot isn’t scientific reasons legal reasons point, it’s people wanting stand out. really gonna annoying. I’m ready go massless I’m vaxxed I’m one store, I’d probably give wear it. According [previous vaccine least 70% efficacy would prevent epidemic. 

If keep elevating vaccination stats we'll good shape keep things check. located? NYS allows walk-Ins age state run cites **Scream Taiwan.**


**Our Vaccine today 400k dose medical workers, word vaccines general public. Jesus, remember reading hydroxychloroquine 16 times day 6 months straight. Glad heard  Murphy needs relax rules MDW. It’s huge tourist money making weekend businesses shore. He’ll never survive reelection ruins “State Iowa joined chat” Moderna 2nd shot made whole body ache walk well  Agreed. Even better would foster cultural norm stay home sick matter mild/severe, mask absolutely must go public sick. Both. talking NYC. don’t pay attention outside lol Flushing?  Masks also protect others. That's get dirty looks right especially people can't tell difference anti-masker Yeah, saw schools making masking optional? Like, mandate says wear mask vaccinated, somehow people interpreted mean bunch kids young vaccinated need wear masks? nuts. makes sense.

What would societal risk, example, letting people documented prior COVID infection dine indoors restaurants, exercise gyms shop “non-essential” businesses? Got Moderna today! “impending doom” “The Super Bowl Spike” He's excellent. Although know he's still calling path normality. couple months ago explicitly defined normality mask mandate lifted. informal polling suggests lottery idea brilliant; seems like would effective amongst people might fall susceptible anti-vaxx nonsense absence trusted friend family member providing info. 

Most people sift information easily use probability/statistics results thereof decision making, information battlefield there, sizeable chunk may simply inundated enough garbage can't appreciably discern anything defer anxious thinking, conspiratorial thinking, general sense caution. Lottery-type things common enough draw incentive familiar override relatively weak hesitance. Interesting.

As March 29 daily confirmed deaths per million covid still 3.0, translates approx 7000 deaths per week, keep 5 year average. 

Is possible enough ""vulnerable"" older people purged herd death rate - post surge - way average (because there's fewer weakest ones left succumb usual things) - two cancel become ""average overall death rate""? nine vaccinated. Montefiore vaccinations, although couple coaches went FL spring training (including manager, also heart surgery shortly after). one knows initial super spreader was. Yankees vulnerable guys, I’m surprised got vaccine. wondering trends apparent. news report states 3 4 deaths immunocompromised immunosuppressed patients. wonder many 287 breakthrough deaths currently reported us non-functioning immune systems small portion population keep seeing headlines deaths.  Vaccinations among adults nationwide. higher numbers due kids approved. 40% NYC, it’s free now. Holy shit, else would state use for? mind blown. Groundbreaking Nah, it’s kids approved get vaccinated. Adult vaccinations yesterday 7 day average 600,000. Thank you! Unfortunately title screw-up nobody else seeing 😕 read article Two. pitching coach 3rd base coach symptoms. originally reported 3rd base coach, pitching coach interviewed remotely one broadcasts said symptoms — mild. I’m sure we’ll defer orders everyone two doses. donate instead. We’ve also donated huge amount money COVAX criticisms us taking unnecessary. may neck neck U.S first dose basis still long go second dose front. Likely doses everyone 12+ late July/early August. We’ll ultimately there’s ton do. don’t produce vaccines domestically. I'm saying taking isolated incident like accurate portrayal. J&amp;J efficacy 64% specifically South African variant. U.S. trial data 74%, real world U.S. data showed efficacy around 77% infection (even including asymptomatic). cannot extrapolate singular incident. sample size way small. Otherwise could take situations claim 100% efficacy since instances fully vaxxed people group caught covid exposure. sample size important. Capitalism requires sacrifices feed beast. 

The Olympics nothing money grab would never happen, think FDA conservative comes approving medicine (e.g. vaccine) young children. also legal liabilities company would want get US. Russia approach saying start giving people Sputnik V vaccine Phase III trial finished (probably kids, though). something said approach especially since we're pandemic. children can't even really give consent take experimental medicine, liabilities involved, US would way. take wrong way, think there's flaw logic here.

It says healthy children higher risk flu covid. However, also say lot factors mitigate flu mitigate covid.

So think better way look is:
Magnitude Problem = Severity x Risk

So covid severity lower kids, risk much higher.

Specifically mention covid spreads easily, people sick longer period, they're infectious longer period, there's greater risk super spreading, vaccines flu (while children right now), vaccines typically cover 3 4 types influenza, treatments flu yet exist covid. got lucky got sore arm mild fever lasted like 16 hours so. Canada ""followed science"" border restriction many months seems like giant distraction draw attention away political fighting feds provincial governments. Additionally, Doug Ford complete failure inability adequately control community spread coupled ridiculous calls increase border restrictions (which shot Trudeau) astounding display incompetence. 

It's truly disheartening see people suffering due border closure myriad reasons Feds turn around say ""follow science"" science supported harsh restrictions since January. I'm fucking fed ridiculous bullshit Canadian government, makes nauseous even read something like this. say want ""keep Canadians safe"" make HARDER get vaccinated? political theater going Trudeau's administration would rival Broadway. 

God, never thought I'd see day vehemently hated Canadian government. shady profile. comments forcing people take vaccines. Creepy. saddest part Japan every chance roll vaccines enough arms June prevent debate entirely

But Astrazeneca though?  oh I'm aware lol. majority people actually give big shit abt tho. ur personally worried stay home whatever want, honestly care. weird people think tell people do. comment get hit auto mod parent comment lol. cold sweats, vomiting last night wicked headache today. Mild compared covid guess..  different putting billboard running ad NBA game. 

They're completely different. Ads informing people existence specific product, service, idea, etc. Nobody needs informing coronavirus vaccine. knowledge overwhelming. Everyone knows exists available. want get it. 

The lottery works informing people bribes them. lot people low bar bribed something would rather do.  life threatening children really anyone healthy Oddly, working home improved day/night schedule. always difficulty night owl early bird world that's getting less less case WFH's going on. I'm even totally sure why. dread morning commute much?  county near 65% one shot. Iv watched weekly briefing almost every week said stuff start distancing careful other, part changes journalist asking questions end, questions asked (usually English speaking) reports always seems like digging answer want. Like asked ""when Sweden get herd immunity' answered ""when 70% 80% people antibodies..."" obviously scientific answer ""what herd immunity"" next thing see ""Sweden aims natural herd immunity"" title sub, rediculouse almost always taken context. I'm gonna go dig old briefings actually life outside Reddit. trial probably specific duration rather period long enough collect sufficient statistics (which unfortunately means waiting enough people control group get sick natural rate infection going around). must budgeted certain amount expected time (6 months) happen, mean take long. Sure does. medical definition immunity. full immune system response.

You would one spreading misinformation. says we're 59% total immunity -- get 65% EOY?

**Strongly disagree we'll low.** 

1. We'll see states gamify incentivize getting vaccine like Ohio $1 million lottery drawings. caused spike vaccinations there, states perhaps Federal Government might same.
2. We'll see EUA upgraded full biologic license turn cause schools, US military businesses mandate vaccine, vaccine hesitant worry experimental changing tune.
3. full approval, we'll see advertising vaccine touting safety effectiveness
4. We'll likely see vaccine EUA children 12 end year.

I honestly think we'll much closer 75%, 80% EOY, 65%, +6% now.  Huh, I'm LA well vaxxed heard No. laws entirely antithetical first amendment minus narrow exceptions like credit card social security info etc oh he's definitely conservative, know say  usually positive test result last 90 days text/e-mail local health department stating last day isolation was. Huh? mix swine flu vaccine flu shot years...why wait 2 weeks?  8 lotteries 50k... saying dont need life changing life changing... Also better.  [it stored normal (2-8 C) fridge  Turns real science isn’t fast CNN Fox News. don’t part Sounds pretty conservative me. Pfizer said sounds like we'll ready earlier end year. September-August sounds promising me. seems like lot people focusing CDC saying unvaccinated people longer wear masks public. focusing saying unvaccinated people still wear masks public areas.

I think we're going see different states different businesses follow guidance different ways might like see also ""refusing listen science"".  Totally do. Unfortunately, CDC’s problem whole time conservative behind news everything. That’s mask mandate partial lift shocking, CDC something news hadn’t already talking two weeks.  Yes. One nine asymmetric. long till anti-vaxxers start complaining they're financially oppressed able enter lotteries? haha, i'm exactly way, get saying. reason, cannot stand vaccination needles, love watching blood getting drawn. satisfying watch IMO. 85% vaccinated, allowed go without masks drop precautions.

Based numbers, J&amp;J performed track trials. awesome achievement, thing might detract mRNA vaccines unheard good.

So yeah, looks like vaccinated. CDC NYS health this. 

For me, takeaway now, stick masks even fully vaccinated. Yankees 85% vaccination rate, everyone else interacted outsides not. Damn, whoever wins pay rent like, 2 months Honestly I’m CA still wish Newsom would this. We’re good, could still better. I'm Ron Burgundy? really hard data make use of, since number hospitalized breakthrough cases extremely low deaths lower. Also, given 2-8 week lag infection death, ""fully vaccinated"" people could still infected vaccine protection.

The number deaths 2 months first dose absurdly close zero. r/fuckthes  interesting see long take ""the herd"" drops masks public crowded spaces. right thing do, Canadians need defend future government wants see sold off. Yes point correct delivered worst way possible. predicted would happen. Hopefully bump year.  
Then next one schedule. may true per-infection basis, Covid far contagious moment far prevalent. Great, lockdown worked wonderfully last year! clearly met Japanese taxi drivers.... Soooo many people survive last year normally have? ""So slow"" said privileged european Holy hell fact keep missing point irritating.

Keeping mask mandate place: strengthens social pressure unvaccinated individuals continue wearing masks.

Getting rid mask mandate: gives excuse avoid vaccination also pressured least wearing mask about. Anyone sees without mask forced trust they're vaccinated.

Who, say grocery store, going make sure unmasked individuals vaccinated? already underpaid employees? There's way enforce that.

What places like Texas making local mandates illegal? Places like schools, kids famously trade illnesses, made mask up.

These places literally perpetual breeding grounds. seriously see problem that?

Why tf tying relaxing restrictions vaccination rates? would encourage people get vaccinated would increase pressure unvaccinated.

Unfortunately, thinking terms real society. increase spread amongst unvaccinated vaccinated avoid mild inconvenience. Pretty damn short sighted selfish. really hoping he's underpromising timeline... ""The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared Actually - seeing alot covid cases 1 hour yet Young - cases people sick 3 shift Anti Mask/Anti Vaccine group.  link CDC says flu worse kids covid? Thanks advance! Yes no. Yankee 85% vaccination rate. MLB allowed Yankees drop masks protocols due this. 

The Yankees also J&amp;J efficacy 64% (really great measure, one exception astoundingly high efficacy mRNA vaccines 90-94%).

What tell us? might mean epidemiologists say CDC’s pull back masks soon. decision correct ideal world, ideal world—or vaccine rate higher general population.

All said, J&amp;J vaccine worked exactly advertised. Vaccine plus masking protocols would likely prevented higher vaccine rates general.  patients see - sick ones ones anti mask/ anti vaccine group. 

Ive seeing 3 day 12 hour ER shift .. China wants maintain key influence Africa helping get doses best interest. getting 2nd doses. think important point keep mind parents worried, children higher chance severe illness flu covid. probable seasonal increases toward end year, though, still big factor much inside contact people have. Though magnitude hopefully way lower. life threatening. didn’t kill us, doesn’t mean would killed someone else. hard read sarcasm text is, plus explosion nutcases sometimes feels likely nutcase sarcastic comment. think strange parents push vaccine kids disease protects life threatening. Oh thought like Ohio giving away one million guaranteed someone interesting bring up! I’ve noticed much scary variant stuff tweets always little confused. fear mongering? Fantastic  lived long enough seen switch Republicans Democrats race. theory, understand sentiment, voting lifetime, needed make choice. I’m sure will, think basically herd animals mostly fall line. rapid decline cases reinforces idea. goal Ohio one generate publicity, did. well fact Maryland thing.   we'll allow it, time china ever visited Ohio see chose million. ""I ain't getting vaccine micro chip, thousand, nah even 40k""

""what mil""

""alright I'm listening"" That’s opinion. issue concept would nightmare rollout late game. Considering variety vaccine cards would need standardized version card plus probably app version would need built etc. would’ve started back December rollout happened Politicians represent hundreds thousands caving 200 people problem. need public, state database local municipalities absolutely zero control over. See liberal hoax all.... needed wear masks get vaccinated soon one available.

When kick shit China? Yes booked earlier announcement. days counter shows 40 something days left, slot booked appointment receipt. 2nd vaccine coming Monday. Let's gooo!  Nice. ! Booked 12 week guideline came picture. MoHFW says take dose booked already. need Detroit terrible vaccination rates. Sitting 28%. long school starts, hopefully mitigates spread there. Same. A1 got second could. Normally drag ass anything needle related. bit tired J&amp;J sleep well, may due anxiety. Took day work could worked really needed to, felt 100% day that. get 1 shot instead 2 big selling point since bad fear shots. Pfizer likely still effective? seems like UK consistently pushes really good AZ/Oxford numbers, perhaps counter others, since homegrown vaccine. UK, beginning showed Pfizer good (number wise) reported elsewhere.  Anyhow, means everyone get vaccinated. [Poe's  exception case, rule? kind idiotic question that? thought going another variant fearmongering article, it’s present bit, brings major point. world’s main vaccine hub focused inwards, it’s others help give vaccines nations virus run rampant. Africa hasn’t hit hard, could swiftly change, large knock-on effects regards variants. We'll see states gamify incentivize getting vaccine like Ohio $1 million lottery drawings. caused spike vaccinations there, states perhaps Federal Government might 

My county started holding ""free beer vaccination"" events absolutely blew numbers water. first event vaxxed people clinics county combined. 

It's amazing help people help themselves. made clear know elsewhere Czech demographic data, know Covid monthly deaths Oct April exceeded Spanish flu monthly deaths country. mortality March exceeded last 120 years exception May 1945 uprising war, months. Today, read Polish covid deaths 150,000 2x reported. Spanish flu killed around 250,000 Poles. reason minimize death toll Covid pandemics see countries similar data. excuse, here, appreciate justification. :) $26 billion drop bucket them. make like month two Asymptotic infections aren’t even really breakthrough cases. vaccine it’s supposed do. Lol really got one  Yes - fewer deaths due respiratory illness meant less expected. Lockdown stopped everything tracks. I'll one better, probably downvoted removed sunshine farts preliminary testing, many infected working zone airport received flights high-risk countries, including South Asia. Several tested positive B.1.617 variant first detected India, World Health Organization said might contagious versions coronavirus.e Friday. health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore. airport outbreak began 88-year-old member airport cleaning crew fully vaccinated tested positive virus May 5. Co-workers became infected later visited airport food court, transmitted virus customers, officials 

Yes infections asymptomatic mild, feels like we're putting cart horse, usual America. work university saliva testing. dropped mask mandate vaccinated people campus week. office still remote 5 us regularly come work. refreshing able walk around office without mask. still wear stores restaurants. it’s getting warm out, mask stifling. local aquarium store today passed hot there. It’s long 14 months. even point hesitancy problem - rollout slow someone know 90 years old vaccinated. 

People flying countries vaccine tours. ridiculous.

So people know contemplating waiting solving problem pretty clear legal enterprising business people could make lot money bringing vaccinating people since must lot cheaper flying LA it. fucking way, airtight plan/s Texas all. don’t know, odds actually best you’ll ever get shot million.

Was crunching numbers:

Ohio 11.7 million citizens.

4,458,088 citizens vaccinated 05/20.

The Vax-a-Million allows registration opt-in manually.

5 residents win $1,000,000 each. 

As today, that’s 1 891,617 chance winning $1,000,000 dollars (not calculating likelihood people forget opt-in register). enough sent halt this.

Nope. countries sending symbolic amounts aid. far enough ""halt"" India's problems. 

And help India outright rejected offer help China. pragmatic way getting enough ventilators PPE volume buying China, place production capability meet India's demands. vaccines work great variants. fact called variants strains pretty much tells everything. There's much anything mutate/evolve like covid can't turn ebola, there's limit mutations. SARS 2003 confers immunity SARS that's totally different virus. chances virus escaping immunity low, possibly impossibility. form CD8 cells across 52 different pieces spike protein covid couple/several mutations, plenty good. like covid first virus mutate anything, we've done plenty fine viruses mutate. flu special case virus covid compared all.

And Pfizer predicting revenue $26 billion dollars vaccine year. Pfizer's revenue 1st quarter year 45% time last year. yeah, vaccines makes tons money. Yeah, companies ""need"" money goal make money can. Ok. reason know shots gave bad reaction one give reaction. evidence would interact change efficacy.

Yes, flu shot general shows get multiple vaccine (antigens) once.. I've heard kids days calling ""tone tags"".

If many/most people wearing mask, social pressure gone. People going think ""oh, look, people must vaccinated!"", they're going think ""oh, look, people wearing mask one enforcing mask wearing, damned I'm going wear one!""

This rocket science, think many people sub deliberately dense desire personally stop wearing mask. pretty much old anti-masker mindset displayed new group people. school district cases gone zero last weeks. still masked seems like adults getting vaccinated really curbed cases younger children.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

well...has long time something made laugh (a LONG time) ... apologize topic serious.

sorry subreddit makes want blow brains out. I’m literally socialist hate biased company likely expensive lease can't get of.

Even get ""right,"" flu shot effective 3 weeks first 3 months. generally 30% 60% effective.  It’s right main post we’re responding to. 7 day rolling average adults went like 19,000 people yesterday. realize it’s hard one day dramatically change 7 day average 19,000 noise. I’m proud us, honestly. vaccine Hail Mary surpassed expectations. Despite working efforts, (and refused take action) crushing thing. 

Thanks everyone part especially healthcare field.  Mark going save us Despite early bumbles I'm impressed. got second shot last week I'm proud people working hard make happen! Well yes also many eligible vaccine —
Yet fine — seen many give parents fine! hate too, opposite. watch fully vaccinated care, trust anybody case care

the unvaccinated care, LOT I’m hurt, think it’s pretty immature argument go straight that. isn’t r/ politics r / political “humor” people tend intelligent conversations sub, make stupid jokes people wheelchairs 🤦🏾 whole state reopened precautions schools went person.

I literally said ""I know lasting effects not, studied enough yet."" hopeful long term effects right win argument?

If lasting effects, I'm right. lasting effects, I'm right. Either way studied enough. I'm really hoping take measures ensure nobody suffer inconvenience sick ever again

No clue arguing there. think masking indoors busy public places another couple months remotely wearing forever. Sounds like what's already happening. least gives businesses freedom ask vaccination go unmasked want. probably did, doesn’t mean wasn’t worth open schools still. It’s cost-benefit analysis. benefits schools open in-person instruction outweigh costs Covid cases deaths?

Countries absolutely need *everything* vaccinate populations first. (hopefully) get critical mass people vaccinated, really flying ""Mission Accomplished"" banners. needs equal effort vaccinating rest world (particularly developing countries). Putting aside humanitarian benefits (which understated), failure provides equivalent global petri dish COVID mutate change sorts undesirable ways. sounds great then. Thx Well don’t know we’re going reach heard immunity.

Additionally, folks spreading disease unvaccinated folks. comes assessing personal risk.

If you’re vaccinated aren’t close contact unvaccinated person who’s high risk, wearing mask okay.

My mother lung cancer. We’re vaccinated I’ll still wearing mask around her. Beyond that, feel comfortable wearing one situations based risk level.

Cases/deaths decreasing people get jabs. numbers increasing still around winter figures, absolutely still strictly masking. situation improving. almost substantial investment education *prior pandemic*, terms facilities, smaller class sizes, etc would beneficial pandemic. could safely opened schools earlier cram large numbers children ancient, poorly ventilated classrooms. nah. want see crocodile tears ""learning loss"" low SES students people never gave shit students now.

Guarantee wouldn’t return favor, Thanks trying. really numbers, Pfizer/BioNTech safe used vaccinate hundreds millions people world-wide without finding serious side effects (except allergic reactions, rare, appear fast easily treated on-spot, real concern).

The virus dangerous vaccine, even young healthy person. mean all. France always going open vaccinations everyone once, soon at-risk groups done.

Also, recent polls show 20% French want vaccine (down 30%, still improving). hoping national stimulus got vaccinated. $1000 per person would great initiative. I'm really surprised offered help get vaccination rate there. us planned vaccination anyhow, extra bonus. fence lazy, good incentive. anti-vaccine piss enough might anyhow money, lol.  Maybe live. Looks like basically whole country open 4th July. 

Summer 2021 gonna lit!  sharpest crayons box always unwanted ones. face backslash camp. reads inverse: ""You still 40-60% chance transmit virus"", pretty damn high. article downplaying figure quite lot saying that's 'much less likely'.

Especially many believe can't spread full vaccination. cold chain capability distribute store Pfizer vaccine, requires extremely cold temperatures. even Moderna one problem. Yes. bit basic data page drilling chronic conditions people died had. CDC seems saying ""no surprises"" data. I'd happy permanent retreat hospitalizations deaths ironic? State sanctioned discrimination really bother everyone. Oregon hand anyway. Counties voted succeed another state NYC locked late according unmentionable ""just flu"". paid dearly horrible deception.

Had new york locked weeks prior, least masked, thousands would spared... ""It flu"". Cries Danish  Thanks! sounds like good thing then. Almost half Americans gotten vaccine (at least one dose). 

Officially, 34 million Americans gotten COVID, CDC estimates last February March actual number four times higher reported (google CDC estimated disease burden COVID see got that). 

Even still less half Americans, would say yes people vaccinated infected. Even see third standard shot I'd bet boosters line address variants may pop up, especially show tendency dodge current vaccines. I've generally flu shot guy anyway like said I'm whatever needed. That’s really good. Thx brother like this, makes harder I'm newborn. He's getting vaccinated think pandemic big deal. Since think big deal, he's still going life, traveling, hanging friends, wearing mask, etc. experience serious illness. would everything power avoid 0.1% chance whatever tortured month hospital. Young people also bad evaluating risk think ""it me."" Yes, what's wonderful spreading coronavirus getting serious infection, larger! Heavier breaths, louder voices, bigger lungs, virus, things bigger factors transmission COVID-19 *touching things*. adult factors, children.

People, covid spread *surface contact*. Good stuff Denmark. 

Leading example pretty much old anti-masker mindset displayed new group people.

Wanting encourage higher vaccination rates ""anti-masker mindset."" That's wild misinterpretation what's going on. 

I spent year encouraging masking effective strategy available. is, people need encouraged move it. That’s dumb question all. would say it’s actually good question answer likely “we don’t fully know yet.” Ardèche. 3 different vaccine centers within 30 Minutes vaccines available every day week. booked solid weekends It’s losing battle...
The anti-mask refused believe reasons, makes willing now? 😭 It's... easy get vaccinated Maryland. want help getting wife set up, DM me. Yes, oracle knowledge :) answer know fall? I'm worried kids getting sick adults around get vaccine ? That's total population. percentage adults. hard find data specifically percentage adults reason.   say article, ""spillover"" effect. kids school since September. able take lots breaks eat outside much possible. But, anecdotally, know people community used schools open excuse sleepovers indoor parties, even cases high. 

In fact, school district keeps track positives, regardless student in-school remote. number positives among remote in-school students. numbers same, implies schools big superspreaders, least district.

With mind, glad decided send kids school person extra-cautious areas lives. eating out, indoor playdates, even limited outdoor playdates. mental health better actually learned something.  don’t fucking say?!?! Agree said, especially caveats cautionary tone, honestly still sure wrong move. pretty clear evidence point remote learning pretty devastating educational consequences widened pre-existing disparities. remote learning 1+ year comes lots costs, too.

We've solution beginning give money schools make sure get equipment need make necessary modifications classrooms classes held safely.

The sad reality conservative governments wanted schools open could get employees back work, want relinquish needed funds. Instead chose worst worlds left kids languish online enough support force back unsafe conditions. still masking while. Here’s definition fact: definition “fact” doesn’t include proven 100% certainty.

Ironically, couldn’t even discuss word “fact” without committing factual error.

Unfortunately I’m German citizen can’t take them… Germany hit higher numbers per day per capita Uk &amp; US ever days ago. limit still supply, speed there. Good news? 

Not poor workers assaulted put hospital worse ask idiot ""show papers please."" still amazes people actually take says seriously. Canada well way already. Mexico could probably use help India extremely diverse population migrants almost countries. state reported UK variant, SA variant. highly possible large diverse population multiple variants mutate host generate stronger variants. 

For example personally know 13 people got Covid first dose. mutation develops within them, highly possible drift towards evading current vaccines (since already antibodies original strain)

This vaccinating entire population fast important. snail's pace second drive vaccination progressing, things look good. That’s rather large hesitancy factor though, hope turn tide Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.

We currently short window opportunity till end June younger generations want get vaccinated quick going vacation.

Once enter Summertime, uptake might take hit lot people likely put time beach getting jab. speak anecdotally, teacher multiple family members teachers different states....

Schools funding largely tied many states re-opening. schools depended ""self-screening"" parents would report symptoms school, mandatory testing provided. personal school recently started providing optional testing per month. positive case, school would receive email, staff told classroom student tested positive. would notified ""sustained close contact"".

The short story even though covid airborne, considered close contact positive case unless stood sat within exactly 6ft 15 minutes. stepped boundary stepped again, timer reset. Multiple family members knew students small classroom tested positive, allowed quarantine remained next student full 15 minutes (but classroom 8 hours them).

This exacerbated government guidelines switched ""essential workers longer need quarantine"". school districts used attempt force teachers come in, even tested positive.

My honest opinion governments federal/state/local want know schools spreading covid. Without schools open, rest community get back work. deemed teachers disposable sake re-opening businesses, schools re-opened.

The studies used push schools opening showed little spread school rich affluent communities full mask mandates, total community lockdowns, lack asymptomatic testing.   Results India shown effective variant. might change things instantly, sooner mandate stops, sooner ball gets rolling. 

So let's say NJ relaxes mask mandate 1 month NY. cases see *too* much immediate change, end mask usage reach pre-pandemic levels 1 month NY NJ. Maybe consider god tired Texans constant wining wants lay millennia. *coronavirus* speak of? New Zealand pretty isolated, SARS-COV-2 get months Argentina?

I think it’s kind okay table option kills people favor numerous options keep alive. public health officials state restrictions would still needed year later? Please let correct. knew since reopened schools first time. Like year ago. 723 epidemiologists say need 80% vaccinated herd immunity factually wrong. Natural immunity counts equation, keeps completely ignored. Marty Makary Wall Street Journal considered natural immunity (late April) herd immunity kick in. looks like spot-on.

Fair enough genuinely think variant EU? Thats ridiculous really ah, thank clarifying, appreciate it! Nothing absolute, vaccines hoped would. don’t legally reside there. family moved last summer support lockdowns work remotely. I’m still employed Germany address there. Struggles single parent.

Kid's dad's good people though. helped worst it. context: two factors currently play here. one hand, Germany announcing relaxed restrictions/special privileges individual level based vaccination status. other, still extremely difficult get vaccinated. Even officially eligible, states using really crappy booking system impossible get appointment unless hawk website. eligible yet, allowed get one non-mRNA vaccines (i.e. AstraZeneca J&amp;J) doctor's offices. Unless doctor happens extra vaccines laying around, stuck cold call practices asking put waiting list. ""Battle Royal"" style allocating vaccines going get worse June many people currently eligible probably able get appointment June 7th, prioritization strategy effectively dropped everyone able make appointment. 

The article mentions new German word, ""Impfneid"" (vaccine envy). German government created word waiting two months announce relaxed restrictions vaccinated individuals. literally way. kids 19 23. raised independent think themselves. sisters love travel around Florida together, concerts, visiting family, beaches. vaccine became available age group...within 3 days fist shot second shot week ago. get mentality younger generation. value experiences material things..get vaccinated. supervisors stupid. fully aware people *actually* want work home.

There long-term studies lingering effects covid vaccine, reasons believe lasting harm. understand vaccine works, body responds immediately system. vaccines, regardless type, produce long-term health issues without also producing short-term health issues.

So two things same. Maybe stick talking things understand. Avoid topic political comments. people ""assume"" already point get vaccine think silly. Flu? Sucks. Cold? Sucks. sick? Sucks. risk sick to?

Luckily I’m virtual option remaining year. keeping mind cases declining 50-60% vaccinated people still taking precautions decent level. people loosen up, going take higher vaccination level keep numbers leveling creeping again. push new cases down, less cases creeping little matter. Ah yes, COWVID-19 vaca-cine means sharing identifiable information negative intent.

Thats extremely subjective, though, open interpretation.

Do ""dox"" hit run driver? drug dealer? Somebody storming capitol? civic duty? Wouldn’t easier ship vaccines instead moving people? It’s like using them. seems like really ass-backwards way vaccinating Canadian citizens. That’s true eliminate worldwide also animal reservoirs. doesn’t work COVID countries don’t vaccines yet carried wild animals. epidemiology experts say don’t know. I’ll go them.   woulda taken Chick-fil-A sandwiche mine. settled dice roll dying pandemic. Yes, concerning combination low platelets. countries decided safer wait couple weeks mRNA vaccine certain age groups virus prevalence low. 

If alternative vaccine, it’s indeed safer take AstraZeneca possibly infected virus. uk 5 digit cases per day long ago, isnt bad? viruses evolve quickly dramatically influenza. fact first vaccines work variants far good sign. distinctly remember one orange individual saying real world, number variables influence transmission disease. Mask-wearing one variables, scientists also recommended social distancing gathering well-ventilated areas; they’re factors transmission. that, likely number reasons states similar deaths per capita numbers (if indeed case):

Try case reporting. states using operational definition deaths due COVID-19? so, actually reporting them, seeing uncharacteristically large spike deaths due “pneumonia”?

You could look also relationships. Voters densely populated areas tend vote democrats, voters sparsely populated areas tend vote republicans. mask-wearing mandates become politically polarized topics, situation (in general) democratic state governments likely impose mask mandates republican state governments.

So we’re comparing deaths COVID-19 crowded population likely wear masks, spaced-out population less likely wear masks. crowded populations are, nature environment, subject interactions risk COVID-19 transmission spaced-out ones. Even mask-wearing limits risk, population density increases it. Comparing two groups doesn’t isolate one variable, doesn’t really tell us much mask effectiveness.

All say, please don’t develop opinions one statistic. Data help us identify areas need studied actually “prove” anything. That’s (sort of) research for. read article. say mask effectiveness much better measure COVID-19 death rate. Yeah adults fully vaccinated, risk children incredibly low, what’s point? going subject children 6-12 months they’ve already lost much terms critical social development (i.e. they’re learning human emotions/interactions hard everyone half face covered).

The argument “they spread unvaccinated adults” doesn’t really work anymore adults vaccinated fall. made choice get vaccinated, that’s elementary schoolers. Sell cow? 

Yeah, Idk I'd do. Find farmer/slaughterhouse butcher guess, sell meat since big freezer, keep tenderloins? love staying late Understand concept jealousy/resentment?

The recent Olympics take place Japan there's enough time set things US (and might postpone cancel next year anyway). vaccine program started, best say needs, again, either cancel postpone it. reason either work fact questioning vaccine likely less educated also demographics that’s thinks gambling financial strategy.  sure. 

""Fauci know? Better check see geniuses Reddit say that."" still kind shocked we're climbing this, America.

Brute-force mass vaccination saving American asses. good preventative health care health care all, pressed, America print money somebody comes solution. Dumb “team” issue, regardless “side.” Variants real concern, there’s certainty become major issue. Trying prevent transmission, therefore mutation, getting people vaccinated quickly possible, keeping data variants, continuing preliminary work development potential updates vaccines, etc essential regardless. glad bit bullet!

How it? here, go hoos Salut Gilles many countries outside United States. know many are? Oh yeah good point, didn’t think that. don’t think sounds worth totally see people wanting that. Well that's real concern countries right too. New variants come countries possibly destroy vaccine efforts countries well. problem Brazil slow vaccine rollout, there's big chance, according specialists, see new strands appearing make applied vaccines worthless. NEVER let covid get control like this, even western countries fully vaccinated back normal, there's real chance powerful covid variant hitting back need go back lockdowns. needed wear masks get vaccinated soon one available

Which exactly liberals told dumb ass last 15 months.   What's really sad people vaccinate, still tout HCQ, absolute nonsense UI? people might like delayed doses option take vaccine recommended manufacturer take make mandatory solve problem weird Dr. Fauci earlier said elementary-aged kids would approved early fall, seems way studies conducted they're lumping everyone 12 together one big cohort, taking time target dosages &amp; analyze results. That's seemed pushed date back late fall/early winter :/ Japan extremely conservative goverment that's slow get anything like approving distributing new drugs done. 

So kind pissed around much they're still 4.1% population doses given despite vaccines available months 99% people: *What fuck supposed live cow?*   fight secondary infections happen people hospitals compromised immune systems. heard said government provide funding virus research lab Wuhan China(pre pandemic), that's clearly lie. “I won’t say airtight, close airtight.” -Larry Kudlow coronavirus 500,000+ deaths BBC best Yeah think so, also think makes sense. enough vaccines now, there’s reason go across border get vaccinated. I’m 24 got shot day became eligible, didn’t wait all. happened? saving dosage reason? internet army Taiwan spreading message Taiwanese discipline voluntary soft lockdown (unlike mainland china government forced lockdown) saying Taiwan would surprise world 0 local cases 14 days (it said 7 days ago). 

They dont lot vaccine received shipment Astra Zeneca yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

They set mobile testing station slight 1000 tests per day using antigen test epicenter Taiwan. think PCR test relatively expensive Taiwan (because buying China, Taiwan government buying China all)

&amp;#x200B;

it interesting thing see drive spread 0 local cases 7 days pure voluntary measure.  understand vaccines work...  article makes exact mistake talking about. can't directly compare efficacy conducted way time location etc. affects overall exposure due infection rate, population density, distribution even existence mutations ... biontech vaccine tested time without mutations ability mild escaping Astra hard understand Astra must lower efficacy rating even would same. effectiveness preventing death hospitalization same. countries vaccinate children can't even vaccinate population risk... Theyre extreme side anti-vax anti maskers. super annoying. Im pretty careful still gonna head restaurant girlfriend weekend. everything lockdown, restrictions US. People took serious first months streets packed again. extremely disappointing, right half japans population could vaccinated 1 dose based amount doses instead nothing. really sad. Sure college put work crunch numbers anyone brain say “yeah I’m surprised” it’s like school going saying 89k people died. said hundred. logical. I’m right lunch it’s probably busy brewery would lunchtime, surreal sit bar bartender mask seen crayon sharpener? Like seriously, 64 pack one attached.

Stupid is, life won’t feel normal don’t encounter huge warning mask signs front every single store. 2020 worst year life hope don’t live permanent reminders everywhere. :( never thought I’d miss 2019 much move fast, much time mutating...

Maybe point, line heavily implies mutate something vaccines protect us matter time. people already Covid. even though store doesn’t require it

Honestly think might give little longer well see things go. hurts nobody else. Im vaccinated wanna wait. lung issue 2014 even tiniest lottery winner chance getting COVID sorta wigs out. LOL. True. meant would spell HIPPA emails, memos, etc. Minor nitpick, smallpox eradicated. Eradication global thing.

Elimination national thing. America considers Measles Mumps eliminated. Now, might need go back measles thing anti-vaxxers making outbreaks common, America eliminated decent number diseases widespread vacciantion still persist rest world.

In opinion, absolutely striving elimination COVID vaccines available us, would possible put political behind it.

Now, get wrong, think elimination goal re-open, fully re-opened COVID still around, elimination absolutely become ""stretch"" public health goal next 5-20 years. Minks serving reservoir big concern (bats less think COVID-19 frequently crosses over, initial crossover blue moon event), cross bridge get get human population right place vaccination perspective. Yeah. understand you’re looking way somehow right. virus doesn’t care long you’ve waiting feel. Someone sue easy bots added conversation social media nowadays....Covid, politics, stocks, etc. People also seem enjoy proselytizing whatever thing they're into, perhaps that's we've become narcissistic society.

I concerns Covid beyond getting vaccinations, proceed independence. ""We can't reopen know well vaccines work variant X""

""OK, good data vaccines work variant X.""

""But can't reopen know well vaccines work variant Y""

""OK, good data vaccines work variant Y.""

""But can't reopen know well vaccines work variant Z"" ""surge"" unlikely. see small clusters forming months Miami Super Bowl TB Super Bowl? like H1N1, polio, cowpox vaccinia smallpox, or... oh wait. that.

Were vaccines using new technology (mRNA)? think lot folk would comfortable vaccines using actual virus (i.e. J&amp;J). even worse - photos videos Putin taking vaccine. matter vaccine used, matter whether got vaccine all. coming outreach money. five million dollars go lot free press lottery five million dollars tv ads. 

Every week someone's face every news station accepting million dollar check. also kid receiving full ride. mean national press coverage worth five million alone. still feel little apprehensive going cus live someone whose immunocompromised. They're fully vaxed well, think they're serious Vaccinated cases would probably someone whose similar predicament. People care never drop empathy first place. really stop getting covid making new strain. 

Viruses give zero shits wealth pieces paper. vaccine help resolve Long Covid symptoms? Booga booga Long COVID among vaccinated, long COVID among unvaccinated? people vaccinated already covid USA Exactly. one credible. ;) Shh.. lately sub supposed say anything except cheering going maskless That's carry cdc card paper, no.

In reality? worst them, there's way really balance one another official figures detached reality. go right see rather numbers. Bodies dumped, people desperate help. level horror evident India beyond anything UK endured--we one worst outbreaks world, undeniably, never ran oxygen, space dead. parts Brazil bad? Maybe, know enough situation say either way. know parts Ecuador overwhelmed first wave degree bodies streets. One day we'll better sense it, yet. McDavid gets automatically transferred team. Yeah, Russia alone, half million excess deaths 81,000 deaths claimed - counting last months. US, Iran, Russia, India, Brazil accused undercounting. believe toll significantly higher, high question. Ummm general population vaccinated many people virus mutate in.

That causes new strains may make current vaccination ineffective. 

Like remember last year variants? virus less deadly less spreadable. 

They covered every health website news source. Please check CDC WHO. Unclear numbers might accurate, think. extremely allergic Aspirin still get Covaxin Covishield? Why? risk miniscule children.

The important part cdc guidance unvaccinated need wear masks.

There 5.6 fatalities per billion vehicle miles UK 2013. every person drove average five miles way events, presuming travelled singly cars, would total 580,000 miles driven.

That's 1 fatality per 178.5M miles. means 1 chance 300 fatal traffic collision 58,000 people attending events. words, risk COVID fatality twice risk traffic death UK — risk traffic death USA, roads twice dangerous. problem Japan vaccinated summer like UK. countries accommodate Japanese governments incompetence? dumb question vaccinated people get covid much smaller viral load unvaccinated people get covid, doesn’t mean transmitted it’ll likely asymptomatic won’t put hospital?

""Indian variant"". technically places business ask new hires ever got abortion fire hire based answer? I'm confused.  Indian variant circulating long enough real world results. believe we’re expecting lab tests soon though. I’d expect AZ effective too. Scary, means vaccine uptake must extremely low given 21M people got first dose.
As comparison uk still 34 37M first doses. Ads informing people existence specific product, service, idea, etc.

At point, goal vaccine. correct plenty information vaccine there, Covid vaccine commercial billboard would pretty much goal: remind incentivize people get vaccinated.

It’s Mommy Daddy driving them, ways one. got pfizer shot like week ago felt like gonna die day fine  coughed three times today, get tested!?!? definitely violates HIPPA I'm entirely sure. said, extremely important extrapolate singular incident 9 infections. could also take example vaccinated people exposed nobody got infected, claim 100% efficacy. accurate though, obviously. trials studies need certain sample size. states lifted mask mandate vaccinated fully, pretty nice Yeah, even though kinda liked going Virtual year, it'll nice go back summer confirm, process live went smooth. gave employees got vaccinated show proof $100 gift card, already know I'm fully vaccinated. Well, kids, understand still wearing mask since easier explaining still wear masks don't, live anyone who's immunocompromised, makes sense too. otherwise think fine wear mask fully vaccinated (at least two weeks second dose one MRNA vaccines getting J&amp;J vaccine.) 

Personally, like wearing masks non-covid related reasons certain situations, I'll keep mine drawer somewhere take needed.  Wonder delay 2022. would probably make money tourism opens back up. Summer Winter games held year before. way compared two vaccines restricting vaccinated time period (only AZ administration started) age group (70+). found similar effects vaccines period.

They comparing health care workers 70+ pfizer, care facility residents 70+ AZ. pfizer cohort 1.7x risk ratio *before* vaccinated, also hospital surge started. Afterwards pfizer cohort's risk rose even higher 1.7x; confounding factors include higher risk work exposure long term care residents' contacts also vaccinated.  Again, uncontrolled data always confounding factors overwhelm signal data itself.

As long doses assigned random, real world data farthest thing like-to-like comparisons. need like-to-like comparisons know vaccines extremely effective. understand agree. directed want vaccinated people still wear masks kids immune compromised people. I’ve also seen arguments minuscule chance get COVID spread vaccinated, still wear masks. Aka “kids don’t believe bullshit coming Fox News actually listened professionals experience relevant fields instead thinking they’re smarter”

I don’t pretend know fix car, someone trained consult would spend whole night trying get Al Pacino impressions. anything verify vaccination status? It’s impossible enforce customers, it’s pretty easy employers keep track employees vaccinated. interesting chart one: reaches 80% 70 80 years old, starts slow down. age ranges lower still lot demand supply. Hence quit Twitter. Full depressing shitbags chance combine flu covid shot lower amount shots average person needs year? read article New York Times need “outreach” reach vaccine hesitant black “brown” (not Indian) communities. 

If works them, author article embarrassed.  Ah, thats true. state give us card name it. think lists birthdate. Mix n match is! could near-0 risk even vaccinated.

Have fun! Tell live Toronto without telling live Toronto :/

Seriously, last hard lockdown, days expecting open (which would dumb policy, honestly locked back way sooner...but really looking forward getting hair done goddammit!) brutal. 

But I’ve got shots booked, hopefully too, sun they’ve announced seems reasonable, science driven re-opening plan things looking way, way up! Yes. Outdoor activities low risk general, since you’re vaccinated risk basically zero. That’s vaccines work. Right, like help someone, string attached, long term relationship... Wait, called friendship?  design. Thank you! care vaccinated people wear masks, people gonna running around without mask probably shithead anti-vaxxers lie vaccinated. There's nothing wrong vaccinated people wearing masks, new CDC guidelines made open season anti-vaxx nutjobs lie vaccinated. Athletes separated? Olympic village? they’re eating? everything happens outdoors Doesn’t go WHO’s caution tested children age 16? even high risk situations, 16 year olds shouldn’t get it? vaccine also one effective.

Yeah thats silly, put next astrology sign please Imo made vaccine saving millions lives deserve billion dollars. Agreed, school announced required fall two weeks ago answering sorts vaccine questions That's exactly point I'm making narrative articles people support them.

People pro-lockdown stance focus articles fit narrative. difference vaccine passport vaccine verification?

Everyday.

Now, school back in, kids get Wifi bus work commute :) agree.

I keep seeing false narrative everybody wants vaccine already it, therefore fuck it, and...no. That's true.

Roll extremely uneven weirdly tiered areas. 

My spouse jumped vaccine like last brownie buffet, guess what? vaccines made available segments population fact initially long waiting lists area, we're still fully vaccinated and/or waiting period achieve full coverage. 

And that's even counting kids became eligible what, week half ago? 

So, no, everybody wants/intends/intended vaccinated covered yet, frustrating see new cases area high November yet local officials basically hanging Mission Accomplished, Fine Now! banner rolling back mask mandates willy nilly. 

I know lot areas better, us still kind soup here, CDC guidelines pretty frustrating. Clickbait never dies  Yep. spreading going big reason see rising daily vaccination rates next several weeks.. (That vaccinating kids) Shut up, Kenny  Wait, mean tell CDC got wrong? again? almost like want wrong. I'm also assuming opportunity get vaccinated.

Many people, pointed thread, opportunity get vaccinated due allergies immunocompromised. Virtually every time too. article confirmation bias factory. Yea, really bimodal poorer households. Either parents got sent home / lost jobs (restaurant workers example), parents working crazy hours (landscaper, low level nurse tech, example).

I know couple people put nanny cams monitoring helping homework K-3 grades kids, home alone. know one family got big dog stay home alone 1st grader safety reasons.

At another workplace know of, took spare room run multiple monitors cameras kids, tried always someone room respond kid's questions online work. 

Everyone online great appreciation statistics people dying need isolate, really appreciation isolation balance looked like insignificant number people. say I'm interested? I'm responding ask, folks always devolve pointing fingers person cornered? see happen time. ""LoOk MiRrOr"" don’t trust government

Do trust scientists? chart report shows concentrations various chemicals used building test inconsistent. differences indicated table report minor enough necessarily impact overall performance test, lab officials told NPR indication fundamental problem

So they'd still work ways, confused people apperently realize wealth inequality problem pandemic. [The Ohio Health Director says achieved goal increasing public awareness interest Dumbasses dumbasses. likely will. They're far biggest supplier point. insane, slippery slopes exist government never abuses power ""for greater good"". Damn right It’s “behavior zero impact anyone else”. Sure, overmasking harmless, sort thinking also leads resistance lifting mask mandates, wanting schools stay online wanting stores keep enforcing mask requirements CDC recommendations.

If think *you* need keep wearing masks, there’s good chance think everyone else needs keep wearing masks too, really start imposing others. That’s true, much longer quarantine? Maybe, many us didn’t. yes, can. Yeah baby keep positive incentives rollin already addressed first reply. problem can't support moronic claim. Glad they're accessible enough point people gotten one actively choosing to. wild eyed optimist!

This first mass vaccination campaign age Fox News.  really we’re talking about? Masks? entire office based commuter culture revolves around reopening economy return normal. It’s purely consumption driven absolute waste resources Less stressful efficient, I'd imagine. could lucky. Nice.

I know fact working mask way harder. Thats people use high altitude simulating masks training. 

But want train high altitude constantly!   surprised all. Getting vaccine like getting lottery. Supply ridiculously limited.  Sounds like amazing time! I’ll check out. Why'd decide kid middle pandemic, first place? lol lol? somewhere keeping track businesses require one point? 

Eventually people going start assuming they're good go without one clear. Except kinda do. None technology used develop vaccine new. Even mRNA vaccines used decades. article got timing almost exactly knew back then. I’m glad hasn’t forgotten.  think anything wrong wanting able visit people without social distancing masks. Seychelles use Pfizer, Moderna J J. completely different vaccine Seychelles used vs. colleges United States mandating.

Statistically speaking, people get vaccinated still going get COVID-19. outbreak nursing home stemmed someone vaccinated two thirds residents infected also vaccinated. anything, appears evidence vaccines fact reduce risk. You’ve missed entire point. retreat masks dropped. soon let go. Yes are, case noticed coronavirus well vaccines lot exposure news, ads effectively. constant news story months end, there's daily reminder life masks everywhere. lottery increasing exposure idea vaccines exist. simply bribe, people amusingly susceptible those.

Distance learning much harder little ones. would thing virus that's currently ravaging parts world?

Well required opinion school. approved yet. that's reason keep school shut leap that, may deadly kids, deadly multitudes others vaccinating kids greatly reduce risk?

So COVID19 really deadly vaccinated person many things life.

A vaccinated person far likely die choking food year COVID19. vaccinated person 65 likely die injury involving ladder year COVID19. unvaccinated kid likely die influenza COVID19, yet never go online learning flu.

Waiting kids vaccinated unnecessary point vulnerable people time vaccinated. We're 32 days since national eligibility given robust immunity even one shot there's reason keep kids school. looking puritanical ""abstinence only"" sorta view never works public health. Hundreds deaths older people CHOSE vaccinated. 

It never job protect people want protected. job prevent spreading people want protected. want minimize anyone's death anything like that, 43,000 cases 800 deaths 2 months 715 cases 13 deaths per day. fall semester, Texas state peaked 20k new cases day mid December, 7 day rolling average 10k basically November 10th onwards.

The point I'm making fully believe opening schools fully lead move COVID-19 cases, statistically number cases added small percentage total COVID-19 cases. Spend couple days Tokyo. best Japan outside big cities like Tokyo Osaka. see lot Japan one month! teachers school walk around available help kids problems. rotate duty teachers one school 100% time.

I’m saying masks don’t work, I’m saying consensus around real world evidence isn’t completely settled it’s hard see masks work real world settings Every week district superintendent sends email stating increase COVID cases students faculty number quarantined individuals. information may already available go school districts gather information. Why? Preventing spread sickness big deal. Better safe sorry. Freedom &lt; lives Good you! Tell fucking adults. kid like 20 vaccinations, adults life go get 1.   number cases could four five times official numbers mean older people stop vaccinating. Yep. could level boomers silent generation, we'd golden.

Give time, though, obviously slowed down, think there's still people made time. Millenials busy young kids, busy careers, many, uprooting life vaccinate priority, they'll get done. tried, next year Texas masks elementary matter whether vaccinated not. hope don’t create nasty variant virus going massive schools. brave! Hard say. Vaccination hesitation seems lot higher here, many states either abolished mandates ( never many ). potential there.

My uneducated guess certain communities vaccination rates low going higher risk surges, communities actually spread map. I'm sure see issues entire states surging, smaller local communities may flair hard times.

Even low vaccination rates I'm rates highest vulnerable still adds lot surge protection. It’s late anyway. People wants get vaccinated already jab. clearly settled enough justify use. There's reason country like Sweden swallow pride 180 months denying mask mandates needed.  Someone posted COVID19 running places go US like phrasing.

Between vaccines (which truly amazing created successful vaccine short period time) natural immunity infection, there's far vulnerable people infect.

Don't get wrong, there's still lot work vaccination end, reasonable hopeful right now.

Some people sub reddit general may hate hear anxiety reopening, could truly close normal months. evidence this, article features economists. No. Way.  Moron governor already removed edited titles. Covered modems access internet available house couldn’t afford it.

The whole idea regardless situation student would reliable access needed without added stress families. least generational debt share peers. normal like normal, normal parent's normal.

At least tell go insane. 9 yo thinking much experience continue ripped overwhelming. lost family members due bringing covid home. Socialization skills helped death long term health issues Needless fear-mongering, disappointing outlet like Reuters. They've typically better outbreak reporting. Well, thanks proving point guess! Smash Ultimate online disagrees Serious question. really significant difference person classes socially distanced versus remote learning space? 

Not trying argue remote learning wasn’t safest option, obviously kids home. It’s gymnasium solution seems bring us right back started, except kids sitting laptops instead teacher person. question vaccinated people gotten lot exposure COVID. lot close calls still ended catching it?

I’m vaccinated still trying mentally adjust level protection. find I’m still freaking every time I’m near someone who’s coughing. would definitely help hear people’s experiences well vaccination held exposure. ATX. one worn mask outside months. Maybe 1 100 people could allergies much anything else. stores probably 70-80% compliance now. 6-8 weeks ago 90%+. millennial, disappointing numbers are. people talk shit boomers time, yet they're sitting 80+% first dose. yet low 40%. get risk age group, still. 40% young people first dose we're maxing out. pathetic. 2020 worried ""other sicknesses"" been. That's terrible argument, IMO, wear mask ""other sicknesses"" 2020. referring specifically flu. 

So, *require* vaccines mitigate risk minimize death. 

Why would thing virus that's currently ravaging parts world?

Why leap that, may deadly kids, deadly multitudes others vaccinating kids greatly reduce risk?

Why tempt fate? mitigating risk, there's question whether vaccinate group that's least likely harmed virus, one likely transmit due close proximity others large portion time every day.  unlikely. 

Between vaccinated people unvaccinated people already COVID recovered, think enough people without sort immunity left cause actual surge. 

There may well localized outbreaks/mini-surges, sure, least US, pretty much beyond point actual surges risk overwhelming hospitals. Holy shit I'm shocked NYT actually publishing positive article pandemic. Feels like first time I've seen this. Trained bees.

I agree right family members worrying 'on fence' vaccine approval speeds also worried covid

when parents high vaccination rate low covid cases state announced would begin lifting mask mandates capacity restrictions mom said early cause people would walking around potentially getting people sick

and told unfortunately cant expect 80% people who've vaccinated (likely eventually state) stuck adhering mask mandates 20% people vaccinated even half people people vaccine nervous feel there's potential long term health issues.

Doesn’t seem bad   Last year: vaccine Consenting adults, what's point? Freedom mean get things everyone else likes. “Better expected “ ? expect? free

Oh sweety, sweety, sweety, sweety. fucking naïve be? There's point talking someone lost propaganda. nice life. gave 13-year-old choice. them? papers show membership. actually didn't. read article, state banned cities counties imposing mask mandates businesses. still oppose - taking away ability local government respond needs desires people represent sit well - ban business requiring masks.

They ban public private schools requiring masks, effective end spring semester though. impose rule private schools, seems wrong well. membership required businesses like gyms warehouse clubs? need show ""papers"" use key fob enter greeter bars entry door unlock you. won’t generate clicks. okay? fact 12-15 year olds comments smarter responsible large portion adults crazy me. US roughly amount infections last year time. Child abuse, even it’s kid following rules, never based. starts feel like tongue swelling throat getting tight, get medical attention. Usually allergic reactions quicker that, case. Kroger near checking either, someone's kid looks like they're 12-15 age group. they'll get shot. That's wonderfully-stated point, misses key issue:

How forcing vaccinated people continue taking pre-vaccination precautions help counter refusal neither vaccinate wear mask?

What stating makes perfect sense vacuum think terms _real_ society, acknowledge anti-vaxxers anti-maskers thing scientifically-sound change guidelines who've followed protocol. 🥳🥳 I’m already vaccinated, don’t want endless pandemic. Well for.thwt need stop depends catheter bags. Hopefully get new idea. /s go hoos!  I’m COMPLETE opposite comes needles.


I love watch whole process, enjoy watching documentary’s operations shown too. 


I think I’d made pretty good surgeon, fascinates me, life took different career path. Please stay sub, stop following coronavirus news, get vaccinated can. Coronavirus basically thoughts past January, big winter wave, even flew back forth Florida back little trip. ended fine.

Stop living fear, you’ll feel lot better. Nephew called tell got vaccine mom told we’re visiting would feel safer letting hold new cousin vaccinated. 
I’m proud him, got RTX graphics card new VR headset. Good kid! Oh yeah misread question. thought reason asking percentage unvaccinated people would feel comfortable elevator. trying say care 6 (100%) unmasked unvaccinated.  I've wondered angle too. bet many people may modified behaviour forever like longer leaving anything office, etc. wonder many personal belongings significant employees left behind 13 March 2020 &amp; never chance pick company closed temporarily eventually closure became permanent. Maybe mini version people went natural disasters go (always go-bag packed). I'm 14 got shot yesterday!! one single dose vaccines, knew would slightly higher breakthrough numbers mRNA ones, test regularly part MLB safety protocols, one symptoms mild ones, don’t seem potentially infectious. That’s vaccine working intended. It’s really hard. kept kids remote end February. mental health outweighed risk. 6 cases school since September. sports (masked) kids play neighborhood friends daily. still worry risk parent, risk risk. jealous friends kids. love babies wouldn’t change thing stress worry taken toll. emotional getting vaccine obviously. person option niece? I’m sorry! kindergartner year she’s able go make friends/do Girl Scouts loves it. strings explicit. sends message China's friend comes benefits. Still calculated long term instead direct string. agree needs research study. I’m worried again.

Yet US saying Roaring 20s style comeback going happening, already progress. this.

I think may be... enough post 7/2

Do believe Biden's goal 70% adults getting least one dose July 4th still possible given concerns vaccination rate dropping among adults? Heh, think pretty cool. I've never adapted.

They also asked ""but tattoo work!"" (I full back piece onto shoulders). Yeah, really thing...  Yes could happen me!

I’m worried hidden variant that’s concerning Almost certain. two vaccines induce similar immune responses future goal, though? Hopefully zero. sucks virus SARS category circulating part influenza season. Breakthrough cases nursing homes happening last months now. sucks happen still happen. note much death rates fallen elderly UK, Israel, US last months. also note appears 14 elderly likely going fine, still shows vaccine still effective.

Like comment said above, pre vaccines, article likely reads 36 infected, 15 dead, 12 critical condition something like that. don’t panic lol. big omission story many exposed? say, 500 exposed efficacy becomes 96%. Considering use similar technology, probably yes. forget seasonal strains vaccine flu ""predicted"".

Whereas case already know variant we're talking about. Transmissions kind hard measure, vaccine distancing rules? friend mine Paraguay looking come visit US get vaccinated here, yes, possible. people chance get vaccinated, good go.

Dude, one-third US population vaccinated, 12% world population. far, far level bring COVID control, every reputable epidemiologist tell you, new variants coming seem increasingly virulent. current estimate two years needed high percentage world's 8 billion people vaccinated (that is, 2023 2024)

Cases also ""dropping everywhere"" last spring. found fall little means. 

People like seem want declare victory long job done. countries legal fuck cousin No, similar. Smallpox 90% fatality rate among Native Americans. COVID-19 5-10% absolute overestimation country 0 healthcare. vaccine 100% effective breakthrough expected. good news cases either mild symptoms all. day show work find they've removed masks uniform requirements vaccinated employees huge milestone eyes  Yeah meng. Nice. Thanks much. already don't? think anything law allows indefinite 90 day extensions changes meaning ""legally allowed hold them""?  Head r/COVID19

You'll find studies data straight source. bit thick read usually get something abstract search website open next window believe per capita basis going order risk least risk people like (24yo health conditions) assume OP also falls bracket really last priority list here. Whereas America opened vaccines anyone asked one quite time ago. waiting called queueing blood There's issue. There's data suggests 3 month gap Pfizer doses effective 3 week gap. suggestion get kids vaccinated flu ASAP. Isn’t available late August? can’t remember definitely concern mine. two vaccines important id love kids vaccines fall. Timing could tricky. Well, yes, BFD.

Go back February last year. maybe handful positive cases UK point. look transpired.

Having cases highly contagious disease meaningless number. effective vaccines absolutely decimating infection rate we'll get 100 deaths per day fall. Yea shocking occurrence!

Even though what’s weird didn’t see news. Shouldn’t investigated?  Yes pharmacies didnt ask US residents not, care giving shots right now, friends went Texas, Vegas Florida btw live area lot young families everyone ran get 12-15 year olds vaccinated announced. School ends next week vaccinations taking place school clinics local pharmacies. school district dropped mask mandate social distancing anyone fully vaccinated gave even incentive get shot. anyone commented 9 breakthrough cases Yankees dealing with? Seems like doesn’t speak well vaccine 9 people able catch spread it. wondering theories what’s going  wedding happening May 29th (the rest VA’s restrictions lift 28th!) I’m fully vaccinated walked around grocery store without mask. mildly annoying thing freaks right SWARM cicadas. 
But Cicadas Covid B.1.351 appears strongest comes evading antibody mediated immune response. Even neutralizing antibody titers people vaccinated max. 6 months ago suggest strong protection death hospitalizations B.1.351. far, considering variants, little worried comes hospitalization/severe disease average healthy individual. 

This know BioNTech Moderna vaccines. Protection long-covid another subject. AZ, follow happens UK, BioNTech, Israel. Things look alright far. believe run problems next 3-6 months unless quite unlucky. go different site instead waiting. Viruses mutate variants. far vaccines still effective variants know longer gets dragged chance vaccine resistant mutation appear we're right back square one. waiting Daughter's shot local drug store, noticed 3 parents teens waiting shot, too. happy see that, even 4 kids getting :)  Yea got lives lives relatively normally reduce huge amounts death year experiencing problems vaccines becoming widely available. Uggg son 5 months short 12. wants get vaccinated bad. Soon kiddo, soon. 15 years old here. sure related shot i’ve sleep paralysis nightmares twice since getting shot, got 17th. hopefully goes away soon. Glad first shot though.

my sister (12) isn’t getting she’s afraid needles... it? Don’t need drivers licenses?  Yeah, got 2nd shot never left home. think got hospital getting shot itself. people think getting vaccine means 100% protected- soooo wrong. verify age. bring 11 year old nobody question you.  hope Moderna same? practice? mean taking ownership African ports like Bollore? French 17 African ports, many shady deals. many China again?

And listen African say China Africa: this: use face masks everyone 5-years age older within indoor public spaces reasonable necessary King County reduce risk CoV-19 transmission CoV-19 disease rates decline, population protected vaccination. Don’t count it..... bodies keep developing antibody mutations ""guess"" direction virus mutates wild. Unless COVID19 defies physics. Maybe it’s people know/follow, people Twitter feed. Many people keep saying thing “I don’t want seem like Republican won’t take mask” “this irresponsible CDC, wearing mask socially distancing foreseeable future” etc. saw people even spread pictures taken workers (without consent) weren’t wearing masks guidelines lifted. Many people freaked fuck life going back normal. maybe stuff online, well, they’re probably indoors often not. HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPA That's true, link April 1, 2020. lockdowns loosened May 2020, cases continued going down. Whats-his-name talking [disbanding coronavirus task early May 2020.  Pretty sensational headline. still don’t think China truthful number deaths Covid.
What happened home villages workers Wuhan went home first wave ?
Villages full old people low easy access medical care ? second Pfizer vaccine yesterday, arm bit sore, sleep last night, feel pretty shitty today, I'm feeling better now. all, would still recommend it. covid January 2020, vaccine side effects hell alot better getting COVID.  making blanket statements race complaining racism. whole identity finding creating anything could find offensive? Must miserable. understand maybe busy area. live suburb end dead end street. outside hour half kids last night never saw another person. None us wore masks ultimately see anyone particular situation would. also especially hot would made uncomfortable. winter times left outside necessary keep face warm hot and/or humid know could ever get used it. I’ll never vaccinate kid. Survival rate 11 year olds 100% CDC estimates around 115 million 33 million infected + another 160 million people

Well, ""another 160 million"" implies totally different set people there's definitely overlap there, but, yeah, total people level immunity pretty high. friends “mask indefinitely” camp, don’t think I’ve seen single soul, even online, talk staying home anymore. Even clinging masks public seem comfortable attending indoor unmasked gathering, dining etc. baseline people covid. still least increase previous measures. 

Should relax procedures high Covid? Sure, doesn’t go far universal unmasking. Maybe go places now, well everyone unmasked... So, follow science til doesn’t fit agenda anymore? Get Papa John trust adequately protect spouse? getting worked vaccinations? misconception running rampant immunocompromised people always live like Bubble Boy, even though truth lead normal active lives, extra precautions awareness.

Then can't expect right now? they're concerned getting sick, wear N95 mask. Social distance others. Go protected hours stores make sure stay safe. Hell, stay home day want.

Arbitrarily saying ""COVID-19 transmissive deadly viruses"", without providing backup claims that, mean somehow different methods protection COVID-19. problem risk COVID-19 running rampant problem. Now? boatload people vaccinated. I'm watching live Taiwanese news now. COVID-19 news dominate, expected. hardly attention paid vaccination, even now. talk number new cases, contact tracing, etc.

And what's hosing sidewalks disinfectant?

Taiwan great start fighting pandemic, really dropped ball vaccination.  I'm seeing anybody say, ""hey, I'll take J&amp;J, GTFO mRNA shit.""

I'd gladly take J&amp;J shot now, Moderna shot offered here. Waiting while, think microchip gene therapy nonsense. tested enough personally. Plus already reckon COVID anyway, so. 

Didn't cowpox vaccine end also killing bunch folk initially? Seem recall last time read it, admittedly ago. Ignorance bliss hear. Probably well 100 mill. Trying explain ""libertarians"" ""no, roads birth Earth. built citizens citizen money continued function society citizens. taxes means probably going paying WalMart toll drive roads get work Walmart."" exhausting I’m liberal area took Covid seriously. town 14,000 90% 16+ vaccinated. one seems wearing masks outside anymore (except kids I’ve seen playground). seems still wearing inside. lot think pure confusion. large city, counties, towns individual stores seem current protocols. It’s confusing often idea current protocol I’m going. Everywhere seem easing though think mask mandates drop everywhere soon it’ll clear. see staff customers without them, I’ll take mine off. I’m definitely “follower” see everyone else I’ll keep mine I’m unsure. Almost 60% adults 1 dose understand CEO complaining about. We're lucky many places fortunate. ima stupid enough believe this..... shame people Japan athletes go may catch Covid games. Apart Sputnik Sinopharm, getting big shipment AZ vaccines jointly made Mexico. Argentina contract 22 millions doses AZ, none arrived country yet. Covid transmission negligible outdoors every except Ontario funny thing ""they break rules, therefore rules compliant"" asininely stupid argument applied anything.

""People age 21 drink? That's laws, ban alcohol everyone! That's we'll stop people age 21 drinking!""

""People junior licenses drive curfew? law, ban everyone driving curfew! That's stop teenagers driving curfew!"". No, absolutely guaranteed increases risk spreading Covid.

I disagree.

There exists possibility increased desire vaccinations protection provided higher vaccination rates outweighs easier non-vaccinated anti-maskers unmask. Morons bad ideas easily conned bad ideas text says can't see paywall &amp; 
___________
Gov. Phil Murphy announce Monday New Jersey lift indoor mask mandate fully vaccinated people follow recent federal guidance time Memorial Day weekend COVID-19 numbers keep declining vaccinations continue, NJ Advance Media learned.

The new rules, follow updated advice Centers Disease Control Prevention, go effect week today, May 28, meaning vaccinated people permitted enter restaurants stores Garden State without face coverings first time 14 months, multiple sources knowledge plan told NJ Advance Media.

The move reversal Murphy, days stood firm New Jersey would ease indoor mask mandate — least immediately — despite CDC abruptly announcing last week fully vaccinated Americans safely go without wearing masks cases.

The CDC still calls fully vaccinated Americans wear masks crowded indoor settings, buses, planes, hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters. Plus, people immune-compromised encouraged speak doctors dropping masks. Officials also noted business settings may still require masks, especially since workers may remain unvaccinated.

A growing number major retail restaurant chains, however, announced would stop requiring patrons wear masks following CDC announcement unless strict state local restrictions place.

New Jersey one first states enforce mask mandate one last announce would lift vaccinated people.

Unvaccinated people still wear masks indoors public, according CDC. considered fully vaccinated two weeks receiving second Pfizer Moderna vaccine dose two weeks receiving one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

In addition, CDC recommended schools continue use agency’s K-12 schools COVID-19 prevention strategies least rest school year includes masks social distancing. Children age 12 still eligible vaccinations.

Murphy’s decision comes tourists residents prepare flock Jersey Shore destinations Memorial Day weekend, traditionally considered unofficial start summer season.

The Democratic governor hinted recent days likely matter weeks administration would adopt CDC guidance masks. meantime, insisted state “not woods” yet came fighting back pandemic needed time drive numbers down. also said would unfair businesses arbiter checking vaccinated not.

New Jersey, early coronavirus hotspot, required people wear mask indoor public places since April 2020 outbreak peaked state.

But number new cases hospitalizations dropped New Jersey, spot positivity rates metrics administration uses tracking spread virus. positive trends promoting Murphy make announcement, people knowledge plans told NJ Advance Media.

Murphy’s decision relax mandate wake CDC’s abrupt guidance change last week sparked blowback governors neighboring states quickly adopted standards. New Jersey one handful states comply, even though Murphy frequently followed cited CDC guidance making decisions.



Pressed recently stuck mandate, Murphy said: “I don’t want get burned. don’t want go back. … save one life leaving time clock, worth it.”

Murphy did, however, drop state’s outdoor mask mandate wake CDC news. People required wear masks outside state social distancing isn’t possible since July.

Outdoor mask requirements also still place child care centers facilities; youth summer camps; public, private, parochial preschool program premises; elementary secondary schools; healthcare facilities; long-term care facilities; state correctional facilities.

More 3.9 million people live, work, study state fully vaccinated New Jersey sites. million people already received first dose Friday morning.

The state set goal 70% New Jersey’s adults vaccinated end June. little 55% state’s 6.9 million adults fully vaccinated. Another intelligent, informed question ignored would Pfizer vaccine. agree fully working retail last year made hate kinds people honestly care less happens him. ***that’s*** scientifically accurate statement.

However, patients still consult PCP Specialist let professionals make determination anything done. Covid extremely contagious, much many viruses (see well knocked colds flus past winter).

Covid much severe many viruses. Even immunocompromised person unlikely end ICU dead common cold, even takes longer clear it.

Many immunocompromised people born way. means acquired immunity many things already earlier life, can't fight new infection.

There treatments viruses. Tamiflu, example.

There IVIG antibody infusions viruses help prevent infection post-exposure.

We generalized herd immunity measles, rubella, even chicken pox days. 

There's misconception running rampant immunocompromised people always live like Bubble Boy, even though truth lead normal active lives, extra precautions awareness.

I even think people want world shut forever, understanding still need work (unless we're going support them??) go school basics life. need figure reasonable accommodations are. going masks distancing, still *something,* covid like viruses (yet least). Unless we're ok throwing wolves well die ""they underlying conditions anyways."" anyone seen anything Gaza West Bank? begged Israel help them. received upturned nose, something behold.

So conditions would continue virus gone wild. 

Keeping Israeli troops out, even though vaxed, logical thing do.

But residents need attention. Money donated, supplies, vax needed.

We've seen images Gaza, horse carts normal cars. Unpaved roads. Refuse everywhere.  

Seriously, mention impact COVID19. Like Trump said, tests, COVID. muh ants confirm.

Source: wife worries me. Notice responses talking points we’ve hearing months, someone asks intelligent pointed question, crickets. I'm similar boat I'm antsier going concert right traveling. I'll actually getting plane first time year, picked great time get fear flying. Canadian lost appeal pandemic, would love American instead Yup, got immunity easy way get lives, get program get immunity hard way. Either way, I'm done making sacrifices. Yes, that's correct. Assuming estate enough pay it. children never responsible single dollar though. quite simple. Even proper equipment, online learning could well impact child's development, doubt topic research developmental psychology years come.

Particularly development social skills something worried about. course want safe schools reopen (for teachers students). possible though online learning negative impact kids think important get back classroom risk low enough. care others following cdc advice pandemic?

Even extremely safe driver living country unlikely die without seatbelt, would still want mandated everyone cut thousands upon thousands deaths. obscene amount money 308 deaths US. It’s small enough shouldn’t something we’re worried IMO. Far children die causes we’d better putting time energy preventing, drunk driving. people cared much COVID. point increased risk sometimes calls increased safety measures.

The flipside would decreased risk calls decreased safety measures.

So decreasing safety measures relative 5 months ago 160M 1 dose 127M people fully vaccinated then, we? I’m sure it’s simple. 

The data comes place patient. Wouldn’t required compliant allow access info (for confirmation)? don’t remember signing anything authorizing got shot. 

If you’re talking showing card that’s probably safe assumption. think people mean different things say passport. 

And can’t blame people ignorant HIPAA hospitals hide behind every chance get. used argue nurse managers reporter weren’t required give info lacked leverage. 

But think general erring side medical privacy good thing. Thank you. agree. I'm done caring people clearly give crap situation. Shingles definitely big 1 3 people United States develop shingles lifetime   causes fewer 100 deaths annually. Almost shingles deaths elderly people compromised immune system. bad enough yes.

Ah, Prohibition, sterling example excellent social public health policy! that, I’ve forgotten take off. Lots people do. Im working Netherlands vaccination center furlough..
Things changing fast moment: week around 5 age groups get invited first shot. right current age group largest size (50 60) lots younger healthcare workers already vaccinated, expect age group date 1 month time, vaccinated first shot 5 weeks.
Lets get country road again!! Amazing people don’t care COVID never act accordingly. get Staggering work shifts beneficial viruses. means traffic also staggered rush hours big basically impossible get serious case covid fully vaccinated. course vaccine reduces risk feel misunderstood studies regarding vaccines. 

Please provide source this. studies I've seen like 95% chance getting COVID-19 exposed (for Moderna Pfizer), 97% chance getting hospitalized get COVID-19. studies even vaccines like 95% effective preventing hospitalizations even risk risk basically insignificant get hospitalized COVID-19 study says 90% protection symptomatic covid. means 1000 symptomatic cases community half people vaccinated 100 symptomatic cases would vaccinated people.

That fundamentally means. 90% efficacy COVID means 90% chance getting COVID-19 exposed COVID-19. mean 90% people get COVID-19 remember trials done mostly mask mandates social distancing.

Do seriously think trials correct controls comes that? sure hard understand.

Because spouting bullshit entire justification ""it's big selfish tell people concerned hide simple thing like wearing mask can’t mandated.

You selfish demanding others cater fears. Stop trying high road here. It’s cdc advice. It’s scummy. still hesitant even fully vaccinated. almost 3 year old idea getting something freaks out. part, that's true. exceptions, many them.
  would come estate, no? see people already trust issues days comes government. Unfortunately flipping statements like really help.  Thank AMA.

Is safe take mRNA vaccine fully-vaccinated traditional vaccine?

The vaccine traditional inactivated virus vaccine. effective overall, turned elicit good antibody response *some* people, according [this would okay someone get good antibody response vaccine, ""start over"" take, say, Pfizer vaccine? Luckily, getting vaccinated solves issue!  Obviously medical experience...but alcohol blood thinning effects? 12 year old got dose #1 week side effects too! (other slightly sore arm less 24 hrs.) side effects 1st sore arm/headache/tiredness 2nd. got pfizer. There's exact date look rollouts different. Israels start earlier much smaller country good deal Pfizer supply issues able ramp super fast vaccinate majority population well US UK could. UK supply issues like US took different approach splitting two doses 12 weeks apart instead 3-4 like recommended, order reach partial vaccination much quicker. Since vaccines effective short term one dose, essentially gave almost lead Israel had, took weeks longer reach milestones. US approaching getting majority population vaccinated states, whereas Israel UK already passed milestone time ago. Therefore expect see cases decline pattern thats somewhat delayed compared two countries, though hard directly compare situation different (Israel UK also had/ super strict lockdowns) too. remember something Russians recommending drinking vaccines period time. read reddit though, so...

Sputnik adenovirus vaccine guys hit 4.7 million today! congrats! Though see anywhere close 70-80% herd immunity estimates. State population 9.2 million, that's little 50%.  

Agree you, gov't ought giving consideration waiting get vaccinated, rather appease anti-masker/anti-vaxx crowds ones misrepresenting making noise CDC announcement tbh. glad gov made call. right move! CHEAPER!!! They're probably dumbasses cookouts middle pandemic.

Having outdoor cookout much safer indoor Christmas party, lot people did.  Hey source this? France figure look accurate all. ""Literally forever"" something came head based anything. Yeah, problem definitely you, dude. worried future humanity looks like past year. Lmao. Kids 12 can't even get vaccinated yet, seeing medical professional likely sees immunocompromised individuals daily. Get piece fabric face. hope find peace mind one day sounds like need it. idiot boss wanted everyone office get vaccinated except him. 

reasoning - covid need due antibodies therefore worth get sick.

while get travels every week. there's option near term, rational man do? 24 hour delay fetching comments.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Nice!! Promoting one thing. Saying deny service unvaccinated another thing. That's scummy tactic. Yup, that's conversation brother. He's allowed see newborn gets shot. doctor actually recommended newborns see anyone vaccinated. Fauci said ""very, unlikely"" True one exceptions. contracted signed union. Yes correct. Even still expected pay person dead? Arlington last weekend lit nothing Dunning Kruger effect lol.

But again, comment section shit show I’ld lying said I’m surprised got upvoted. guidelines give people incentive get vaccinated. They're beneficial harmful IMO. 


At point adult vaxxed you. point, nearly mathematically impossible hospitals could even run covid cases. 

States low vaccination rates likely candidates covid + winter would chance overrun limited capacity (likely still lower 2020). state showing heavy resistance vaccines prepared larger usual (2019) level patients. think states try difference people living miserable. 

If vaccinated still paranoid getting infected anti vaxers crowd big enough justify people damaged though. 

Hopefully people less scared weeks cases deaths continue decline. Yes vaccine appears greatly reduce chance do, level that's acceptable risk people. Masks masks none. middle ground basically unenforceable. “Show papers.” national vaccine ID card. CDC cards meant reminder slips - something official. easily forged. They'll check card ID. them, allowed in. article April 6th - newest CDC guidance. Wow, whopping 6 questions answered.. basically parroting WebMD. feel like AMA's experts shallow. say so. guess year stormy. I’m surprised CDC guidance WASNT far out. wanted get vaccinated waiting lines die given last opportunity CA. probably feels great lies problem though. everyone gave shit species come fruition society come people caring one thing affects personally. got determination, hard work, collaboration.  Also note authors believe self-administering aspirin multiple days vaccine also likely improved outcome. comforted knowing forced wear it? mean... first off, trying get wear mask you. understand likely tough situation getting pressure sides daily basis? Secondly, first hand experience disease. that. probably wants minimize risk patients possible. Thirdly, kind rude ask someone change way fit needs. moment forget covid even exists... converted Islam started concealing face, going act way? freedom wear mask. freedom find another therapist. believe problem lies you, that's opinion. time being, either ask sessions zoom see face, take risk leave (your favorite therapist) find someone else might also wearing mask effective. would choose nothing get it. Besides offering zoom sessions, can't really control situation all. essentially customer. feel like we're stuck time.

Has anyone else seen comment literally every single thread positive news relating coronavirus past year?

It's going 2040 I'm going see comment snap back reality wonder last 20 years went. RemindMe! 6 months  worldometers dot info nice graph cases deaths going way back start pandemic. welcome show us graph mask mandates stopped pandemic. point exactly vaccines started putting end even anti maskers becoming anti vaxxers.

Vulnerable people already limiting exposure public pandemic falsely believing forcing people cover face going make safe.

These articles death throes media feeding covid fear. Gotta make hay sun shines July outrage even obviously false. 

At point can't decide stupid topic we're going argue forever: masks last jedi. really good point, thanks bringing up. I’ll lookout flu shot 8 year old 11 year old earlier usual year, crossing fingers get Covid vaccine October. Trickle Economics. definitely works. needs years actually trickle down. mean, yeah like 40 years already, totally work. Eventually? Idk, i'm thinking going 🤣 Could enlighten scientists say? need confrontational.

Based link, seems “Health experts caution majority people vaccinated, continue wear masks public, regardless vaccination status. it’s disbelief large number Americans would rather kill neighbors inconvenienced past year

Exactly. I'm incredibly self-centered person phobia needles, decided overcoming fears could make world little bit better, get They’re saying it’s safe want (unless you’re mass transit others) it’s call end actual mask requirements acknowledged that. posted article touches poorly communicated intentions left everyone poor situation.  take CDCs latest guidelines “You resume activities without wearing mask staying 6 feet apart” fully vaccinated.

They required wear masks school year but, least now, required next year.

They're going required wear municipal summer camp either, know that's state government mandate municipal government decision.

As question:

Cowpox first vaccine. 1796 Dr. Edward Jenner realized milkmaids get infected smallpox made connection relatively mild cowpox could confer immunity, started subcutaneously inoculating people cowpox (as opposed variolation actual smallpox virus, conferred not-insignificant mortality rate). yeah, could say ""a new technology."" BC, Canada focusing getting everyone first dose waiting least 13 weeks second.

What thoughts this? result less protection? 

As someone health anxiety also high risk makes nervous. Correct- 127M 38.6 fully vaccinated according quick Google search May remember 9/11 much came together terrible day. Obviously, direct terror attack like different.. scale death COVID much worse. sadly people cried cried 9/11, like did, even ones nobody knew affected (I'm NJ/near NYC know LOT people directly impacted... neighbor sick called day he'd dead, friends lost uncles, parents, etc)... 500k die COVID people saying even serious. Strange times... world become dumber lots ways since then. Thx Using seatbelt analogy, people safe drivers minority reckless ones. required everyone wear seatbelts regardless safe were. actually helps point.  “You resume activities without wearing mask staying 6 feet apart, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace guidance.” Based upon areas lifted mask mandate go back normal per CDC. Vaccinated people listen local health officials cdc says. wear mask everything required local health officials want. Even disagree see follow rules. don’t think cdc needs implement anything more. LOL Many erring side caution fear. People far motivates protect loss advance towards gain. phenomenon called Loss Aversion read Thinking Fast Slow. Cities Texas kept masks mandates. effective. people definitely take steroids treat mild comfort conditions, though, doctors considering whether drugs actually needed right now.

In end, people weakened immune systems need continue careful get oral anti-virals like protease inhibitors SARS-CoV-2, luckily clinical trials speak. people would also likely need much careful typical flu seasons oseltamivir/Tamiflu exist. mum diabetes several heart conditions. 16. eligible vaccine. friend also 16 got vaccine, tell got private NHS. got condition illness. I'm sure parents though. Thank much doctor. Indian variant US since mid April. you’re us Pfizer generally 17-23 days first places 21 days 3 weeks. it’s Moderna it’s generally 4 weeks first second. you’re another country I’m sure. think majority need vaccinated, literally everyone seems bit extreme , hospitalizations already low USA due vaccine fear health safety community. follow rules jail endangering others. That’s great true, I’m betting it. happen Perhaps  did, sorry that.

Being belittled (first time hear word) makes explode... majority exactly it. lazy go way it. Lottery gives people enough push it.

Similar reason found going door door offering people vaccine effective. make sense?

It's you, makes sense scientists. follow science! US's numbers would much higher made easy. must nice healthcare system. We've got Wild West: head unknown figure out. silly response. 365 days ago trend going without vaccines 

Yeah, [locking largest city There's seasonality non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs, e.g., distancing, masks)

Right now, trend *while removing NPIs*. news good, really love fact demand first shots still high Canada. Common sense would say atleast 90% people get first shot return second. could huge number Canadians fully vaccinated summer. regularly referred COVID trackers made really good info graphics. popular poo-poo Times, parts (like opinions section) feel better ignored, also lot great work. make sense? still transmit COVID vaccinated, exempt wearing masks? No, won’t. family support. can’t spread something don’t have. stay home live fear. I'm Jewish. oma stories. number tattooed arm. pay attention. stuff terrifying.  Thanks explaining, hope come rude. 

They've got work sure. cdc didn’t say anyone needs drop mask. Besides that, propose ensure unvaccinated stay masked, per cdc guidance? Honor system doesn’t work won’t implementing vaccine passports. It’s almost like state governments prioritize state residents. horror! isn’t right wrong, it’s works.  Anyone starts hitting people drinking hit people fucked anything. blame booze that. know, Edge really underrated browser. don’t understand people it. longer wear mask outside still wear inside cause want vaccine rates go bit higher am. mother immunocompromised. lemme extra cautious another month! actually read article, realize stupid sound. know *are* negative long term effects? be. vaccines current variants may effective, possible could change future, hence need boosters. meant increasing immune response.  right really empathize parents children either age 12 immunocompromised, factors may lead others’ ability get it. 

I would hope we’d seeing age limits vaccine drop soon least alleviate problem. 

The scenarios depicted trickier. really don’t see much way protect populations, barring either hitting herd immunity judicious wearing N95s populations. say everyone around done part got fully vaxxed greater good, almost impossible control folks aren’t right thing here. sort statistical illiteracy (innumeracy?) anything else told 50% chance fine, 25% chance mildly sick, 15% chance serious illness, 8% chance hospitalization, 2% chance death or...just take vaccine - would say ""nah, I'm cool 1-50 chance death going restaurant""! still lot.
but good progress specific facility sentiment true al US. People fear going hospital sure way run savings might have. Especially sad close 70% Americans less $1000 savings (2019 data): Check out.  [Everytime someone says something wrong HIPAA, Harry HIPAA Hippo gets I’m ya Lol weed cause aggression like booze  Pre covid life lead rise covid coming demise American dollar raping earth shared finite resources. sustainable attempting blindly go back life consumption going hasten fall. don’t think true. We’re seeing COVID surges Latin American countries poor uptake vaccines. happen many regions US high vaccine refusal rates. Making procurement vaccines state-wise thing seems completely bonkers me. think they're literally country tried it. Along nationalism-based policy refusing import vaccines significant quantities, government completely botched vaccination. Bet Conversely though, everybody else's obedience dictating lives past 15 months. say again! Fair point. Thanks Non-US wealthy countries scaling vaccinations insane pace. Canada passed US first doses yesterday (they appear giving everyone first doses starting second doses) ~doubling dose deliveries month, deliveries scheduled increase ~50% next month. western European countries giving second doses (disproven) 3-5 week interval; Germany month behind US (and vaccinating faster then).

And scaling stop. EU signed contract Pfizer build new plant (in Ireland) make 1.8 billion additional doses next year. Canada also building new mRNA plant (in Ontario). US appear either, sadly.

The last week good state though; addition 12-15 group pushed pace back up. current pace probably fine given may another surge fall. different.. less chance hospitalization death... that’s scary part still don’t know what’s going everyone wants fight  It’s also month since vaccines opened everyone US. month gaps shots, unavoidable lag get “fully vaccinated” numbers up. states state schools making vaccines mandatory, others making wearing masks illegal. mention odd targeted approaches. NYC given one shot J&amp;J subway, thought “what dumb idea”

Thousands people it.

We 100% continue boost numbers. Finally, light end tunnel working home real answer. states? hoping see studies actually came conclusion new variants substantially challenging children.

A lot variants contagious, yes. believe part. nothing really shows new COVID-19 mutations deadly/more difficult children deal with. Brazil article mentioned, explained say sheer number Covid cases country - second-highest number world - increased likelihood Brazil's babies young children affected.  course, cases and, result, hospitalisations, greater number deaths age groups, including children. pandemic controlled, scenario could evidently minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president Scientific Department Immunisations Brazilian Society Pediatrics.  high infection rate overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across country, oxygen supplies dwindling, shortage basic medicines many ICUs across country simply beds.

That's really ""new forms deadly children"". mention source last week says mortality rate low, least Really hoping that's case, I'm hoping usual summer trip mid-August worried they'll still quarantine place, would silly. least consider vaccination status tourists like EU planning. Hey friend, I’m unaware exact numbers Moderna strongly recommend getting can! doctor primary say all. don’t know AE had, unfit advise medical care. 

In meanwhile read might help: data Pfizer Moderna discussed link, you’re definitely getting (or even lot!) protection. No, didn't, say explicitly first comment.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   HIgest Paid Person’s Opinion? Unfortunately, seems isn’t entirely case. links [a [or found significant proportion infected &lt;18yo reporting symptoms long infection run course. NIH currently running another large study looking this, aren’t alone.

My impression children seem lower chance hospitalized^1 adults much lower chance dying, chances mild-to-moderate symptoms long-haul symptoms similar adults.

---
1. Hospitalization official line “severe”; wife spent couple weeks laying face, sure suffocating, tremendous pain, pre-existing asthma heart problems, hospitals area full week O2 didn’t hit magically low target pumped full steroids, officially “mild” case. Saying kids lower chance “severe” case shouldn’t necessarily ease mind, even without potential long-term problems. article says 80% vaccinated people took survey said concerned public health restrictions place intended destinations, compared 38% unvaccinated travelers shared concern.

Basically, I'm vaccinated, want go vacation see inside hotel room lockdown.   matter degrees. likelihood getting ill small. like flu things. taking words twisting them. I’m saying don’t care refuse hear people don’t want resort insults. ( personally, general) Oregon outCaliforniaing California! I'll bring cdc card behind prioritize giving first doses only. would really helped. Everyone vaccinated would gladly signed first much earlier.

A lot people got access first mid-April. still way fully vaccinated we've started 12-15 year olds. 

Canada awesome following UK's example. best model stopping transmission COVID much faster.

The USA 60% adults vaccinated first dose. Israel ever got slightly higher that. We're reaching point want gotten it. lot countries EU hitting hesitancy limits lot faster. Canada going reach point around 60% adults vaccinated. We're still giving 1.8 million daily doses. Demand trended lower,  don’t quite get people anxious reopening really wanna understand feel this. Maybe don’t feel way whole changed since I’m truck driver. I’ve going last year. thing different sometimes don’t wear mask time still do. live bubble. Every single person I've spoken either gotten vaccine, planning get it. found yesterday office 2 160 people said get vaccine survey.  Original SAGE document found here: Besides, also ridiculously date. vaccinated European cannot come US unvaccinated people countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Iran exc. can. “We didn’t leave apartment two half months,” Ms. Paulino, 30, explained, saying family Still, explained, unlikely get vaccinated. God whether got Covid-19, said, whether died.

Yikes! wear coat winter god decide that? think we're fine limited exceptions. heard anyone complaining continuing mask mandates hospitals doctor's offices, instance. Blanket restrictions issue. categories adults can't get vaccinated, well protected vaccination. I've reading lot unhappy comments public unmasking persons immune system deficiencies, easy see feel way. Wow politicians sure busy posting.  increase hospitalization cause vaccinated people basically spread virus they'll spread low viral loads actually helps get us herd immunity faster. Giving someone low dose covid literally vaccines used be. really hope so. Thanks people didn’t believe wearing masks didn’t get vaccinated. Thanks efforts. health insurance.

The real scare younger people even COVID... long COVID. *Especially world health insurance tied job, job depends healthy enough work.*

I'm overall healthy, got shot second eligible. I'm exactly high risk death, around already vaccinated. long term symptoms would really expensive fuck life.

Sorry, free shot avoid insanely good offer, mind microchips implanted me. Hmmm don’t 5G reception, get Windows 10 weekly update. Weird. normal? need read history flu future likely covid19 like flu although still kill small number weak infirm people wont virulent lethal today. covid like flu early stage evolution. annoys though scare us staying home saw along cases factories airports letting people whats point staying locked home flout rules big business? significant differences vaccine. 

Yes, vaccination better vaccination, they're same.

Plus common experience point, common experiences (like weather, reference cliche) naturally make good smalltalk. could get away keeping six feet away people flu 

I think necessarily could have. think influenza still travel, dealing higher viral loads necessary get infected.

You're also acting like masks perfect defense. even masks immunocomprimsed folks careful. never took seriously first place anything change lifestyle from, they've already traveling.

Meanwhile us vaccinated see change big step.

That mean take step, absolutely can't wait get back normal I'm past nervous stage, I'm vaccinated part ever personally protected now. Awesome still take advantage it, parents high risk going back France would risky without fully vaccinated, past 2 years pretty long I'm telling you...

Still, that's nothing compared people like article talking about. I'm hopeful borders reopen Summer!  wonder trump selective ""stopping"" pandemic. wonder. shit right here. universities schools requiring students vaccinated prior return campus fall. can't wait go back campus fall see everyone's faces! 

The Zoom meetings cool I'm ready get back sitting *in* classes encouraging. Holy Jesus... I've drinking everyday past week (yes, know... bad, I've stressed, hah), luckily drink day second shot, yesterday. intelligent friend stance. take mRNA vaccines, he'd reluctantly take J&amp;J.

Edited add took mRNA vaccine. We’ve cool kids since like, January 2021. complete shitshow throughout majority pandemic. never play odds children's lives.  Shut hell find new cause say everything right. assume means locked masked could get vaccine. I'm also assuming opportunity get vaccinated. risk gone. Move life. need make distinction here. Adults get vaccinated don’t forgot them. Children can’t parents prevent to, much. Sky news terrible sensationalist mean normal people? dude hit me: fucking WILD many doses US considering rate vaccine hesitancy. 

I returned school EU people (in confirmation/selection bias) extremely pro-vaccine frustrated long it’s taking. 

My state got like 50% reasonable pace it’s crawling. exactly one death might linked Pfizer vaccination. 80-something doctor developed thrombocytopenia days following. rare reaction vaccine, may also unrelated, happen too. Zero deaths proven related Pfizer vaccine. don’t live Europe don’t latest news last heard, Germany planning giving mRNA vaccines second dose AZ first.

Also, they’re yet studying “mixing” vaccines. Spanish trials encouraging there’s yet consensus. It’s likely mixing vaccines ok tho. two models one Chinese firm due **needle need use unnecessarily provocative title.

Personally think provocative enough, own. clear, people maskless workplace vaccinated people, per CDC. That's justification kids also get vaccinated, fully agree with. think comparison ""hundreds kids dying versus hundreds kids dying"". calculus easy. think happened accidentally tied another argument original reply (what appropriate restrictions right now), really point original reply.  might truthful saying, undermines concept risk tolerance half America seems lost past year. Everything risk. Lie. Death rate went Texas dropping masks. read article? bills hospital didn’t code expenses correctly. It’s debt justly owed them. reason fight paying unjust debt come estate.


The bills can’t thrown away ignored.

It’s also bit absurd say parent wasn’t concerned wealth management pay hospital money wasn’t trust.  BBC: many babies dying Covid-19 Children Helping Surge COVID news, people take seriously worried repercussions people don't. expect much panic point. Anyone that's vaccinated choosing take risk get much sympathy. Ofcourse young children adults can't get vaccinated really shitty they'll risk too. reading articles there, seem confirmed. Basically, Fortin, Anand Trudeau reported 48M doses end June, probably think suppliers would send us. Brodie super conservative reported confirmed far since Moderna's schedule deliveries yet. deny anything far, need wait see, nothing says receive expected 48M doses. wrote makes literally sense. spread high gave USA high immunity rate. also massive amount vaccinated. current spread low, cases dropping like brick. Coming right dangerous, probably less Canada. got vaccine early march, doses.
They say next academic year person i’m sure govt waiting countries vaccinate children here.
The difference govt prioritizing single doses instead both, it’ll take time think Damn :( one friends lives Buenos Aires. supposed visit last year due pandemic...he's actually staying till end year asks visit think that's even possible I'm guessing still good idea? know lot Americans traveling South America feels kind bad ethically...I vaccinated tho Oops! Please see page 8. name was, impossible lockdown long manage effective one.  hope so, seeing deaths spiking guys almost solved fun. flexibility hygiene protocols mask usage would devastating. Local guidance even show people use mask, I've seen people noses poking since start all, keep seing em

I probably get shot anytime soon, can't get it. much appreciate kind comment. patient, thank isn’t “defying” lol it’s personal choice Yes. US, least. Hell, I'm sure it'll eventually end even Brazil India.

And I'm wrong anyway, reasonable prediction, it? much theory CDC knew made announcement Sounds like great way discourage Canadians getting vaccine across border. Damn right, vax in, mask off, worries yeah, right. even think scaling issue. bet IBM cam spin epass solution states real quick. political issue, that's all. interesting, Maryland actually relatively well 54% **total population** first shot, 44% completed vaccination rate really dropped much.   places database kind doctor access print copy vaccination records. screen shot dates lot numbers case. It’s MyIR state others, you’ll need check specifics location. It’s also whole honor system. last year, think lot people wary trusting others. Better safe sorry. Thanks getting vaccinated! Get mine tomorrow rollout vaccines younger children? Like 10-11? That's complications sickness. get many.

The long term effects completely different story. It’s question democracy even fairness, it’s question public health safety. It’s new thing decent society majority burdened ensure minimum standard safety regardless danger caused uncaring minority population. Yep I'm it. (Though also sad bad people probability... that's whole different worms) purely epidemiological standpoint, yes, social distancing, transitioning remote work/school possible, increased hand washing, etc. likely helped slow spread prevent infections death.

However, clearly many consequences policies: bankrupt businesses, depression social isolation, addiction, spousal abuse, missed medical care screening non-COVID illness, massive government spending, familial stress, lost educational opportunities, missed “once lifetime” milestones.

I think time ultimate judge “did right thing?” protect neighbor

I got vaccinated soon could protect neighbor, really proving horseshoe lol downvote army got party membership renewed. Cant wait Europe, countries, get production capacity scales up. vaccine great flexible platform - capacity serve us well going forward 💉🚀 Embarrassing Yes, cases deaths crazy sounds, willingly. “clinical trial”, happened vaccines approved country. vets also tried themselves. still serious symptoms, albeit rarely, still spread easily enough. definitely immune. LOL funny point HIV plenty laws place criminalizing spreading, reporting HIV status -  I'm sorry what? see info page 5, word ""Pfizer"" literally entire document, anywhere.

Have you, chance, linked different document intended? Inhaling even small amounts cause death mere minutes. Pretty sure Cuomo would problem “CAUSE SHE’S GOT GREAT ASS!!!!” ? current rate infection way important happened year ago? Imagine wearing piece cloth protect neighbor becoming political hill die on, lol studied right now, vaccines may promote little immune response people taking certain medications underlying conditions. small business owner immunocompromised, allowing vaccinated people business _is_ assuming responsibility risk. see right say must allow people store may present risk health. several reasons cited dumb reasons rural white people won’t get vaccine. It’s poison. It’s government tracking. Etc. 

If willing take chance injecting poison long shot win money, dumb rural white people everyone shitting on. Yet reason black “brown” people excused criticism. Turn television    new coronavirus. dog variant. New. dropped dogs kennel using fake name ( Rover Leaveland ) never pick up. Also bought tp. It’s bi-directional regard towards society whole. free set fire drink drive (since latter places undo risk people). yes governments decide creating increased risk people inappropriate illegal (like spreading germs global pandemic). Hah, Scared cicada take over? I’m behind news...... Given public's ability interpret public health calls, supirsed said that. known corona viruses cause minor cold symptoms. one, SARS, MERS weird ones. confused removal, agreeing everyone else saying? Also means maybe 15.6 covid. Since masks social distancing lockdowns halted things like flu least covid could worse without precautions. 

So maybe precautions helped? cue paranoiacs advocating dog mask mandates 3...2... Texas lifted mask mandate weeks ago, well new CDC guidance. Mississippi Florida followed day two later. Cases continued fall. Although plenty people voluntarily masking, cities kept mandates place. absolutely. know. fully vaccinated I'm worried me.

I'm worried unvaccinated virus runs unvaccinated unvaccinated

that's I'm asking every eligible American get vaccinated fast possible Oh Yeah, Brother!!!! Let Hulkamania run wild you!!! live 5 minutes outside NYC NJ side. sick year, large part due masking public. Honestly, I'm young enough healthy enough COVID probably real effects (I'm also fully vaccinated two weeks ago), catching dumb colds throughout year nice side effect whole thing. I'll likely continue wear mask subway crowded spaces well beyond end pandemic. Lots people NYC already COVID memories SARS pandemic SE Asia back early 2000s. going part system punishes excludes others.

The business isn’t discriminatory aspect person excluded changed. cannot change race sexuality, change vaccination status. It’s free thousands excess doses. I'm supposed move NoVa soon scared lol Pay Wall Lol. 

Tonight I’ll go bed dream Saskatchewanean variant again. actual ""science"" cloth masks. 2 people masks get infected 15 minutes, 2 cloth masks frankly pathetic 27 minutes. Better yes, shows weak cloth mask performance actually is. Now, Yeah that’s said “might be”. There’s time requiring time allowing vaccinated people go free, indeed.  gotta get coronavirus subreddit seems consuming man. Imagine invested owning cons Lifting mask requirements intended effect. Glad hear we're altruistic (though benefit everyone)  One thing though don’t think requiring vaccinated people wear masks unscientific it’s necessary get unvaccinated people wear them.

promoting vaccination: good thing

Not promoting vaccination: bad thing

What speaking happen infections low enough level epidemic threshold. Pfizer?  hope realize daycare isnt exactly place development? Early age development - parent. got mine Costco phone number text vaccination status.. add tour apple wallet twins got first ones today. happy hopeful. Yeah, _you_ would. /s get possible long term effects Covid. spread virus community highly contagious. vaccinated also ditch masks, too. It’s entirely 0% change CDC guidance. Adult vaccinations aren’t increasing. Completely disagree. Every EU country means crisis this. realistic cost/benefit analyses vital. hard imagine anything outweighs lives hundreds thousands people. ~600,000 Americans died. Better worse policy decisions public compliance could easily either halved doubled number. question whether ""someone"" died; whether 800 people study suggests died worthwhile sacrifice 5.5 million students get extra weeks 100% classroom. 

And could made different sacrifices wanted schools open safely. could locked HARD weeks implemented rigorous contact tracing get case numbers low low there. could kept bars restaurants closed reduce spread. interesting study seems suggest little uptick due contagion happening school. due adult behavior ripple effect schools open. imagine public health messaging told people needed double precautions schools opening. leaders Texas sending opposite message. 

Which makes somewhat uneasy conclusions. people taking schools open sign go lunch, cases result caused schools open failure parts response? World-wide specific country?

World-wide 166m reported cases 1.6b doses administered (enough 800m+ full vaccinations). likely many covid cases reported, though. Oh well god brother man must mean everyone would.

What's main vaccine? think protection severe symptoms, importantly, hospitalization death matters infection. Almost vaccines protect close 100% hospitalization deaths. get infected, likely asymptomatic mild.  many lazy people every profession. would think anything unique % lazy people teaching profession. pray you’re right, don’t see happening, especially international travel opens back Vaccinations rates since announcement higher maybe know something assumed??? circles looking private schools social distanced, required masks, active testing, spread students families low. public schools social distancing non-existent, proper masks hardly enforced, testing schools cases shot up. place covid incubate spread source massive community spread. I'm glad able prove numbers kindof hard assume opening schools would zero effect.

Has ever vaccine widely used US discontinued later due side effects?     Full text: coronavirus epidemic Czech Republic continued subside Thursday, 672 new infection cases registered country-wide, data Ministry Health shows. lowest number detected cases Thursday since August 2020.

According Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, number vaccines distributed (administered?) Thursday also hit record 95,700.

The fall cases slowdown pandemic also led lower death rates. past week, fewer 20 people died per day. significant decrease compared hundreds deceased March.

The reproduction number currently lies 0.73, lowest past month.  people vaccinated point covid?

What percentage population recovered covid? Except many people intended anyhow. kept waiting ""come already"" dropped bomb unvaccinated go without mask 12-15 year olds approved Pfizer. kids go Saturday first shot first available time.

[COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Case Investigation I’m male mid-20s. Tomorrow I’m getting Pfizer vaccine. comparison death rates Pfizer vaccine vs covid19 age group? New York City completely locked down, start burying bodies Central Park. know narrative trying push, least disservice subreddit spreading falsehoods. live somewhere eligible vaccinated? grandma vaccinated? It’s always nice show disagree someone making fun disability. I’m genuinely surprised family member refusing get vaccine rule follower. boss work said next week, everybody vaccinated take masks now, thinking getting take mask too.

Obviously, tiny sample size, think people fence reasons small enough need small nudge right direction. they’ve countless friends get disease fine. think better argument would getting vaccine = decent person/helping community. ahhh Long Covid!!!, tons friends covid fine. Seattle, basically everyone still wears stores, even required. half people still wearing outside. hospital policy early N95 aerosilizing procedures, surgical masks Covid situations. don’t think saw difference hospital acquired Covid. personally wear n95 covid don’t know one sneeze face (it happened once). said surgical mask unmasked Covid patients (test positive later) never got Covid pre vaccine. Non n95s hell lot protect people. I'm right border Pennsyltucky people surprisingly diligent wearing masks whole thing. Yesterday, went store without mask first time year (I've fully vaccinated since March) super weird. would say \~80% people store still wearing masks definitely got look two wearing one. american expat living Argentina, hope well. government reluctant deal Pfizer/Moderna(a political problems middle) along gross mishandling vaccination process. 

At moment, received Astrazeneca(in small quantities) Sputnik V(in larger quantities seems good vaccine) Sinopharm(small quantities well). Either way, doubt I'll immunized time soon(even though I'd first sign up). wait awhile see

What waiting for, lol. hundreds millions doses given, we'd see mass problems existed. Everyone wants/wanted ""normal"" bad drop masks. That's vaccine does. get herd immunity that's best case scenario, happens many people possible get vaccinated. tragic. course big providers rushing end relief programs even though there’s significant chunk population still vaccinated. Florida California nearly identical numbers Florida's population much older. I'd surprised real death toll least 10 million. prohibition mask mandates new thing last week read 2 republican lead states followed. yes wear masks forbidden enforce masks. Oh yeah, forgot one. Yikes. might try opens. I’d rather avoid travel Germany. Get vaccine. Come back days later case side effects day repeat weeks later. 

I French drivers license social security maybe it’ll work. I’m okay it. okay asked ID prove it’s vaccination card? I’m okay showing ID prove it’s vote. I’m also okay dollar voting somewhere doesn’t ask “papers”  That's good. reason people good dad mom divorced. real, definitely hit point hard conceptualize number. We've basically lost mid-sized city's worth people. Even good portion group going long world without COVID, that's lot misery. 

What dogshit year. someone Northeast US, Texas feels different area Australia does. Unknown long term vaccine side effects really aren’t thing. vaccines them. Honestly think anyone care. try, especially opening regardless age condition, want get vaccinated.

I got vaccinated two weeks ago need ID card social security card, apparently reading reports foreigners without social security card still able it. one looked address identity card, even asked live. want vaccines arms. Even surging vaccines fix issue since leadup times pfizer moderna take 6 weeks maximum, taiwanese TV predicting peak wave 2-3 weeks. (Canada) need decide soon extra AZ doses used certain provinces risk expiring couple weeks. Even provinces want use first doses anymore (here NS one example) would offering folks already got first AZ would gladly move second dose get vs waiting late summer. know people personally would jump chance I'm sure many others would too. make drastic impact overall 2nd dose uptake better letting go waste. 


And failing that, donate immediately go bad. No. Kids wore masks year. sent kids door last day school LISD wore masks. transportation building? live NY? There's excelsior pass get. point, one sufficiently acknowledged people advocating remote learning, (among negative effects) people probably actually die remote learning. immediate clearly causative someone dying covid.

I think controversial say remote learning far inferior in-person learning, especially younger kids. yet know much short term effects persist long term, likely least especially amongst lower socioeconomic class students may resources available catch up. know lower educational attainment lifetime income levels associated higher mortality levels poorer lifetime health. also know effects felt students also parents, forced work degree programs care kids home. So, think controversial say school closings will, fact, kill people. number compared increased covid deaths reopening schools entirely different academic debate. Unfortunately seem attitude “well get sick I’ll prolly fine”. 8 year old nephew flat know socialize around kids age anymore become incredibly socially awkward. It’s Iowa 48M total end June. Sio (Current stock + upcoming supply June 30 = 48M)  Solidarity. wean months in, literally two weeks got invite vaccine is. visitors? zero stores live cesspool Florida. Agreed  Inside businesses require it? Almost everyone. Inside businesses dropped requirement? half. Kids absolutely get sick

Having said incredibly lucky kids likelihood getting sick much lower

And better yet get sick macro level outcomes worse viruses live (RSV, flu)

The silver lining COVID little impacts kids risk death continue go case loads / exposure risk goes down, irony 25 year old motivated 1 800K chance win million dollars versus motivated 1 25K chance dying COVID palpable. Much less 45 year old numbers even lopsided (1 2.5K chance).

I dont think kids 10 younger move forward. Spoilers: check anyway. Let tell you, teacher, staff members absolutely vaccinated.

We've one slippery slope since vaccines became available.  told masks needed vaccine became available elderly/most vulnerable population. vaccinated told keep mask vaccine available adults (high risk not) happened told high school kids/middle school kids needed vaccinated ditched masks. Now, I'm hearing need wait even longer 2-12 year olds vaccinated arguing believe slipperly slopes. mouth open = lying like rug. Duh Got first Pfizer yesterday nothing feels like mildly bruised arm far today. everyone else know got it.


One in-laws got Moderna seem report anything serious. really pretty common shot cause side effects? Coronavirus provided definitive proof people yes, stupid selfish. SMH. Sure, may never to. whole point many people voted party person ended Trump. Democrat incompetent him, I'd hard time voting him.

May want get vaccine release real virus. chip shortages due perfect storm supply demand changes coming together:

- Work-from-home stay-at-home orders greatly increased demand PC-related things (desktops, laptops, also gaming consoles).

- Supply chains disrupted due pandemic.

- industries, demand underestimated production scaled much. important example car industry. Manufacturers cancelled orders various car electronics components expecting greatly reduced sales. demand ended much better feared, struggled get manufacturing time semiconductor factories, time slots mostly filled others.

- drought Taiwan threatening TSMC production. TSMC massive produces large amounts chips Apple, AMD (CPU GPU) well Xbox Playstation (which use AMD chips), well serving tons customers.

- midst major factors, smaller issues like ship jammed across Suez Canal helping either.

Unfortunately, large parts semiconductor industry located south east Asia, vaccination campaigns generally far along US Europe. expected industry experts shortages last least summer, markets well 2022. Hey, die, guess fine right? (many bad noises.) Anyway, vaccine apparently helped people symptoms. That’s need 30 years quarantine!

I commented sake health respond articles read? It’s incredibly worrying anyone

No not. media narrative shaped mind believing so. read scientific articles. course are. Gonna wreck us lack worry.  

But today (May 21), International Olympic Committee Coordination Commission chairman John Coates sought reassure them. “It’s clearer ever Games safe people participating safe people Japan,” said. lol reddit horseshit It’s 100% either way. still helps somewhat. 

Another reason it’s important unvaccinated keep wearing masks, per CDC guidance. conceivable way ensure happens everyone continue wear masks. see currently practice continued mandate everyone mask mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons. I'm 16 lol. literal 0 chance fine.  collect 5 self-tests per person per month local pharmacies (Switzerland). family uses round testing every Monday morning kids brought school.

This obviously included stats. Guess can't control world much we'd like. also hurt entire generations kids. may terrible consequences. I'm scared covid either. Never been. brain head. Good luck we'll see finish line.....maybe. Flu vaccine average 40% effective taken every year, whereas vaccines seem 80%+ effective. know sure, number experts suggested reason expect COVID immunity last years.

I think COVID vaccines prove completely different ball game influenza vaccines, say.  mandates actual enforcement anti-maskers socially ostracized. bad there's *lot* stupid selfish people around. Hey Joe, ever cancer? Oh God asked illegal question! QUICK CALL POLICE! Yeah that's Seattle well. Tons people still walking around uncrowded streets masked up, let alone inside grocery store every body still masked even though required them. plan making unmasked debut weekend Target though. There's theory certain number people HIGHLY prone night-owlism, genetic-evolutionary advantage reasons. 

In short, tribe eras past (going back 200,000 BC!), advantageous always certain small number dedicated night-owls tribe, stay awake, help watch tribe dark hours.

I’m starting get sinking feeling we’re never going session goes unmasked again, seems like really silly thing upset by, honestly makes hard personal connection communication made work us before.

She covid recovered fall, I’m fully vaccinated since February. asked could fully normal sessions couple months ago got vax too, said wasn’t sure, couple immunocompromised clients gonna wait get vaccines. makes sense me. back March though, vaccines fully open 2 months can’t imagine that’s issue anymore.

Anyway, asked last week given updated CDC guidelines data showing vaccinated people don’t really spread covid....and said “we’ll talk next week” (since mentioned leaving), kind sense don’t think it’s going comforting answer.

I don’t mind waiting another month two fully normal sessions, doesn’t feel like that’s what’s going happen. It’s really frustrating she’s smart rational person, data showing virtually zero risk either us anyone else comes contact with, it’s really frustrating still try work like compromised manner spite it. I’m scientist, it’s peer reviewed won’t read it. Thanks pointing out. would incorrect.

That assumes choice kids staying home learning remote, WFH parent, versus going school. always happened.

Sometimes, kids went relatives day parents worked. Often times retired older relative, exposing risk parents come home, possibly spread kids spread grandma. worse kids going school possibly spreading teachers? Kids hug grandmas. Schools could, have, set social distancing protocols masks.

Sometimes kids went childcare facility, usually staffed women lower income, ability advocate better work spaces. kids co-mingle lot settings. easier keep kids ""pod"" school.

That count kids went hungry abused actually able stay home. neglected, take care parents left alone go work. became depressed killed themselves.

So yeah, people die. perhaps would died schools open remote learning options- really cannot tell data have. ""open schools, kill teachers keep schools closed everyone lives"" people also bad evaluating risk think ""it me.""

A true statement, although narrow scope unnecessary. Optimism bias affects virtually everyone regardless age. Covid over. worry Sinopharm primary one Seychelles used. general knowledge vaccine immunosuppressed people vaccines effective cause problems. However data research long term impact people?

It's hard find new information regarding aside general knowledge mentioned above. Noone:

America: 

""Mission Accomplished""

""Fool once..."" shit numbers super interesting, lot states really well COVID-19 vaccines.

Hawaii best US state right now, 97% age 65+ 75% age 18 64 least 1 vaccine. begs question me, Hawaii still opening quicker? They're still employing vaccine passport continental US come islands, honestly get it. They've done well vaccines main industry tourism, really understand they're dragging feet let vaccinated tourists come in. I’m saying aliens, may aliens. 

Yup. Checks out. I’m technically still millennial (29) everyone know one cousin gotten vaccine, noticed huge correlation pre-vax safety precautions age experience health problems didn’t. sense people experience illness, even higher risk covid, took way precautions (we) know awful ill experience getting something low odds.  Thanks this, forgot still kiddos vaccinate too. hope see much lower baseline now. ""May led ""

call actual data Here's rundown vaccines US history caused known adverse effects. I'm excluding incidents without confirmed harm happen US.

1955: batches polio vaccine contaminated live polio, causing 250 cases.  vaccine solid manufactured correctly, incident effectively discouraged development inactivated virus vaccines ever since, none US-licensed COVID vaccines type.

1976: swine flu vaccine risk Guillain-Barré Syndrome 1 per 100,000 doses. swine flu raging US would considered acceptable side effect much like blood clotting issues Astrazeneca. whatever reason never really got here, making whole exercise unnecessary, stopped administering it.

1998: gastroenteritis vaccine caused bowel obstruction infants. effect extremely rare something happens infants sometimes making hard detect, effect still quickly found vaccine market 9 months.

End list. Looks like Kate signaling something similar. She’s meeting lottery commission.  look like kid picture wearing mask eyes? Uhhhh actually 99% good enough sorry. That's still risk /s thing happening schools.

One day received two emails school:

1. happy announce 4 days/week hybrid learning! (it 2 days/week)
2. Two members school community tested positive COVID-19 Well really. misleading specifies percentage. suppose someone know means % population could find misleading. 

If strictly comparing jabs arms numbers also account vaccines recieved/ordered/available country too. Canada orders far less receive hundreds millions doses sends out. factors especially low temp storage requirements pfizer moderna big impact well areas country logistical nightmare get vaccines stock. interesting posted earlier.

At point, relief foreigners allowed rest world spared japanese ""olympic wave"" covid cases. Well CureVac better announce outstanding results deliver afterwards :) Means lot people living said country lol. Update us goes. live DMV curious people actually going :) think we're quite yet. daily doses, we're still getting 2 million doses day. Demand definitely declining, we're still vaccinating ton people per day country. NYT article suggests we'll hit 70% vaccinated (age 12+) mid late August, imagine that's we'll basically point everyone wants get vaccinated vaccinated. Imagine dense also budgeting decisions: schools choose budget things.

Like people ask pays universal healthcare. do. paying life; government chooses use tax dollars space program &amp; extra jet fighters. 🤷‍♂️ mixing things here. infected, cannot transmit virus. studies previously looking infection, symptoms. quite studies actually tested participants regularly test infection. MRNA vaccines around 90% effective preventing infection, infected, transmitting (as there's nothing transmit) Sounds like definitely get vaccinated makes happy hear can't wait leave sub I'm sure long covid defined, suffered serious physical effects probably 2 months post covid. getting severely breath sweaty walking (which know normal people anyways me). heart would begin racing randomly. crushing headaches two weeks post COVID became less frequent time went on. I'd rather get COVID, bees terrify think denied men, happens mostly women ones requested it.

Akita, 87, dead two weeks later.

Diagnosed pneumonia? Hmmm...

Stories japanese hospitals overrun emerged throughout pandemic. combined japan's abysmally low testing makes really question numbers report reflects actual situation japan. taken model appealing US Thank expertise time, Dr. Bakri. 

Aside higher incidence mild moderate side effects, know mixing vaccines, especially respect vaccine efficacy across similar timeframes non-mixed vaccines? Speaking specifically received initial dose AstraZeneca likely receive mRNA second dose. statements aren’t made government? private news organizations making comparison. That’s true. wish US given support parents workers could stayed home. live nothing else.

Please homework posting next time. vaccine 90-95% effective reducing infection. little bird told MIGHT finally lift restrictions Memorial Day June. Either way, though, we're getting end. reached 4 million fully vaccinated today. announced yet, see soon hit 4.7 million we're clear. Period. surprised high level efficacy mRNA vaccines?

Not all. Vaccines develop immune response. tested widely. Covid triggers similar immune response addition effects virus blood, lungs, etc. tell one carries ""what long term issues never identified?"" literally anti-vaxxer logic.

That's total hogwash know it. idea long term implications people face covid. ""long Covid"" studies already indicate problems people including children.

There plenty viruses cause long term effects. example:

* RSV first 3 years lead higher risk asthma decreased lung function
* HIV often results AIDS 5-10 years initial infection
* Chicken Pox cause Shingles
* Adenoviruses known cause long term cardiac issues

None new. ""anti-vaxxer logic"". documented science.

All saying cautious. Make sure sufficient ventilation schools etc. cases area would probably also make sense include masks. things hurt children. ""overtly cautious"". still people dying Covid. someone hadn’t gone way turn masks political debate people wouldn’t uptight letting go.

So reason irrational is...the guy irrational first?

Not exactly buying logic.  I'm actually surprised NJ went aggressively it. PA announced restriction changes 2.5 weeks ago, enacting Memorial Day. Oregon seem making changes time soon Good 👍🏻  don’t disagree, let’s forget politicized first place. someone hadn’t gone way turn masks political debate people wouldn’t uptight letting go. case, 14% likely 0% still 0% lol gives incentive get vaccinated, thus ends higher vaccination rate, actually should.

I guess I'm really asking effectiveness measured. Also, understand even get COVID-19 vaccinated unlikely get seriously sick. something I'm curious about. I'm argentinian too. 18% vaccinated first dose, strategy UK, vaccinating people first dose. Millions vaccines coming following weeks. vaccination started december, year ago. opposition made everything possible boycott measures covid, including opening schools middle second peak, like Buenos Aires. lastly, population care restrictions kept going parties family gatherings.

Luckily, vaccines started extremely effective, drop 95% 75% disastrous. (Especially since still around 97% effective preventing severe cases)

But still want get people vaccinated ASAP, know could happen future. Yep, clear. kinda funny everyone's divided masks vs antimasks though. want keep wearing mask, even aesthetic purposes, right so.

The CDC data *is* based Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca sample though, would much love see studies samples countries received different vaccines. Specially since live country many vaccines with, ones use minimize transmission start going without masks, gonna hell (it already is, oh well). That's like idea generalizing. guys almost vaccinations, *we much not* OP, get headline title. hell that? Lmao come reason people want vaccinate young children badly? Yeah, Oregon rule needlessly complicated. really hope gets dropped soon. I’m fully vaccinated basically everywhere go still requiring masks. believe asking variant coronavirus had, vaccine. wish. They've right before, they've also less correct before, they've also wrong before. instance making recommendations incompletely data sets.

Not surprised, disapointed. numbers per capita. relative population size doesn’t matter. There's also uninformed people dismissing study fit point view.

Using flat 0.8% interesting one arguments I've heard ""what vulnerable locked down"" (early cases spread nursing homes, etc) Probably realize 99% people live it, majority deaths elderly, sick, etc. got vaccine never afraid dying COVID. think odds getting vaccine unnecessary.  positivity rate calculated? number positive tests day divided total number tests day? so, seems like indicator public knowledge. High positivity rates could mean public good self diagnosis knowing tested. Likewise, seems like region could intentionally test people unlikely positive skew results lower.

COVID19 really cause complications death kids moreso flu. Here's CDC saying shut prevent *adult* deaths spread schools, children. We've known since early complications death children rare. fact, that's model OP discussed - adult deaths.

Mitigation strategies schools well studied include many things beyond directly answer question regarding vaccinations, certain vaccines required schools, there's state country requires influenza vaccine kids attend, aforementioned actually deadlier *for children* compared COVID19.

The heat gonna hit 90s consistently soon. drive people indoors AC, drive spread.

But we're 46% vaccinated plus whatever % previously infected.

So expect another surge like March/April nothing like June-August last year. even close Nov-Jan disaster.

For adults, Covid even improvement due work home. AZ good vaccine, IMO biggest issue long gap people take first second doses. 3 months quite long time doses. mean mask mandates schools? Ugh, ready next school year. Public Health England regularly publish methodology results vaccine studies. [The recent (accepted April 27th, published May 13th) shows that, appropriate, accounting underlying risk recipients measuring vaccine effectiveness relative baseline infection rate population vaccine kicked in. Participants aged 80 years older vaccinated BNT162b2 4 January 2021 higher odds testing positive covid-19 first nine days vaccination (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 1.77), indicating initially targeted higher underlying risk infection. Vaccine effectiveness therefore compared baseline post-vaccination period. 

The way compared two vaccines restricting vaccinated time period (only AZ administration started) age group (70+). found similar effects vaccines Participants aged 70 years older vaccinated 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) similar underlying risk covid-19 unvaccinated individuals. BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% 69%) 28 34 days vaccination, plateaued. ChAdOx1-S, effects seen 14 20 days vaccination, reaching effectiveness 60% (41% 73%) 28 34 days, increasing 73% (27% 90%) day 35 onwards. 

Confidence intervals particularly narrow yet, look pretty similar moment. [South Korea also similar real-world effects symptomatic infection vaccines one dose (89% Pfizer vs 86% AZ).

What clear testing regime matters kind efficacy symptomatic infection likely observe - one reasons many caution directly comparing efficacy numbers trials. real-world studies using multiple vaccines country likely closest thing get like-to-like comparisons. individual already right withhold disclosing information. business also right turn person away disclosing.

That’s true don’t think agree it’s significant growth daily numbers low with. rate would take Ohio rest year reach around 80% probably lowest could expect herd immunity kick in

A lot growth also &lt;20 group 12-16 year olds become eligible time.

I’m sure even attribute growth lottery announcement. Could spike people getting kids vaccinated. kids getting vaccinated.

Everyone else basically same, kids going Schools offered socially-distanced gymnasiums, kids could get dropped order go school remotely (w school computers &amp; internet).

So solutions; dont fall lies &amp; excuses. Poorer families get extra help; lot districts politicians chose sabotage remote learning prove biases. live Northeastern Ohio, mask mandate entirely lifted everyone June 2nd. yet see people wearing masks inside businesses, stores, etc. people ever wear masks outdoors.

I went dollar store first business I've seen sign says ""if fully vaccinated longer requiring masks"" everyone there, including me, still wore one (even though fully vaccinated). think probably mix reading signs wanting odd person out. businesses still ""masks required"" signs up. 

Interestingly though, last weekend boyfriend went church parents (we religious, keeps parents happy attend every often. dad also preaches) maybe 20-30 people attendance, 2 wore masks, one lady removed halfway through. 

One two people coughing quite bit. definitely made feel bit uncomfortable. know older folks especially coughs various reasons, I'm sure anyone's vaccination status, seemed like inconsiderate thing tight indoor space (small town church) mask coughing service. one seemed concerned though. really sure feel. 

There always rebellious people businesses wear mask (and toss whether employees would enforce say something) I'm really surprised Ohioans ditched masks. I'm excited lose them, really much bother me, arguing people feel strongly masks either side exhausting. point habitual throw mask walking inside, first time enter place noticeable number people wearing them, I'm going gladly take mine right :) think June 2nd. Please reassure us... Well continue rate decline (-36% past two weeks) we'd around 18,500 seven-day average around June 3, seems within realm possibility we'll around 20k Memorial Day.

Heck, get ticket wearing seatbelt, refusing wear mask potentially spread deadly disease. 

You provide license prove licensed drive, asked show vaccine card said considered ridiculous.

*I'm advocating so, car thing really got thinking.* long term studies heart disease, people still eat death 

&amp;#x200B;

not sure get point sounds like health care capacity,  Depends moment. 

* Work 100% required
* Stores \~50% ( explicit requirement wear mask )
* dining &lt; 10% that's mostly staff
* social events &lt; 10%
* outside &lt; 5%

I live state never mask mandate. Upstate NY even Walmart, I'd say 98% people still wearing masks indoors. saw disappear outdoors almost overnight, though never many people wearing outdoors begin with. Awesome, time 2% infected persons B1.617 variant (less South Africa variant). British variant still far dominant one 87%. RKI report Wednesday ([Full - PDF warning)

Wouldn't call widespread yet. people using real service dogs...

Not everyone likes dogs dogs trusted around strangers dogs. Plus people allergies dogs room bad mix. brother would leave homes dog throat would close up. I've traveled fully vaccinated. (Flying - rent cabin summer) must say nice knowing sense protection trying get life back somewhat normal. However, still worry people around assume vaccinated. Still mask thing, double masking plane. Sweet, sounds like they'll back track point depends many unvaccinated go around community without mask. argument opening schools kids statistically safer school communities, depending communities must add. 

any argument BS: course opening schools pandemic logic pose risks risks kids teachers operators.

no doubt THAT. NONE Yeah people IRL much middle road anything see interwebs. feel need shout it. seem like lovely person bummer.

I avoid family members anti-vaxx types kids got shots

Can't imagine dealing something kids can't get vaccinated yet  look five largest states U.S., Florida right middle pack. New York Illinois estimated slightly less underreporting, Texas California reported slightly larger underreporting. give point comparison, whereas Florida’s ratio 1.41, California’s 1.93, 93% underreporting. Cool Literally every comment reading headline saying ""no shit"" read article. could said ""this might happened, really know study based bunch guesses reviewed yet"". thousands comments thing Texas devil.

Makes sad read this. That's kind you, feelings different thoughts! guess we're circle feeling sorry lol.  got first dose yesterday pretty slow hospital got OBS: CANADA 10X TIMES LESS PEOPLE... MAKES SENSE CAPTAIN OBVIOUS Every (once every month+/-) kid's face begin perspire. slowly start turning red. SLAM!!! goes fist desk. ""CAN GOT...GOTTA... WATER!!!"" 


""HEY! told guys stop eating things!"" 


But, seriously, never imagined troubling would kid want eat. sounds like ""Hot dogs? No. Chicken nuggets? No. Spaghetti? No. Mac n cheese? No. Pizza? No. want then? MnM's. FINE! here. No. What? Nooooo!!! want MnM's!!! Omg... Hey, gotta eat something. eat breakfast lunch. Little girls growing (6 now) need eat every day."" 


She want eat different diagnosis care discuss here. long short this: real nightmare caring someone essentially eating disorder realize much hurt themselves. 


I wish anyone. certainty, hear students describe everything tastes chemically metallic. One girl said eating watermelon one favorite foods like eating slimy styrofoam. popcorn like Styrofoam glass it. Yeah. Avoiding problem, seems like something would want 1-year-old. That's two cents. positivity rate mask mandate live never 10% even peaks. 60% state vaccinated mean tell masks provide protection vaccinations?? feel much comfortable sitting across vaccinated person person wearing mask. Fortunetly it’s “these people” dictating activity. It’s elected officials. stance correct. People plenty opportunities get vaccinated want it. let’s move on. bad enough yes. extreme example, killed half everyone, yes would banned. less extreme examples would banned. Whether bad enough separate debated issue. common sense always make laugh reddit collective things like controversial. health emergencies require everyone work together

Then we’ve fucked beginning find irony hilarious though. Like walk around Trader Joe’s downtown Denver I’m one maybe two people wearing mask despite fact I’d bet everyone vaccinated store. right public health decisions based Science, POLITICAL decisions balance public wants versus acceptable health standards. works way Flyover land removed mask mandates early on. motivated public sentiment, that's fine long residents understand ramifications. Democracy reflects people. fact Hawaii majority voters Asian/Pacific-Islander like stance state leaders taking, like folk Texas Fl support politicians who're heading opposite direction. quote Forrest Gump: stupid stupid does. Schools, courtrooms, polling places? made chuckle, still important remember kind scientific miracle we're dealing with. I'm expert (someone correct factually incorrect statement make come across it), vaccines normally take much 10-15 YEARS developed normally. mix readily available funding, previously available research, new technologies global sense urgency allowed come year. vaccines affective (eg: flu vaccine), ones got incredibly effective, they're also effective variants. 


A lot things could played differently. clinical trials failed? variants different? vaccines effective, nearly much? We'd much getting tunnel. actually checking boxes. nailed it.   I'm sure flown lately, fact check entire flight lots announcements heavy fines/being banned airline fact take mask off. really different. Must nice giving shit happens bubble. What’s like live like that???  Amogus sus Make epidemic disappear definition, sure. virus going disappear. Dogs still get virus. organisms planet. cannot stop mutating new variants. Maybe will, maybe wont. know. vaccines virus killers. like injecting hand sanitizer something. essentially give body tools fight virus. sus Thats bit sussy Kids 12 never population COVID19 really effected adversely. 

Disease population usually mild, rarely resulting complications death. Influenza example deadly complications COVID19 population specifically. 1. Vaccinated people basically risk respect COVID, whether catching covid (very unlikely), spreading covid (very unlikely) getting serious case covid (basically impossible). literally reason wear masks.
2. Anti-vax anti-mask people shitty people ignoring CDC guidelines along. pretend they're either going listen mask mandate now, pretend they'll follow lead vaccinated people wear masks? responsibility vaccinated people role models shitty anti-vax people likely follow lead anyway.
3. point pandemic prevent spread COVID-19, prevent hospitals overwhelmed. never going get spot COVID-19 longer thing. we've reached point we're sort hospital supply problems, enough people vaccinated prevent issues future, reason continue mandates. know we're point yet (just uninformed), are, reason keep sort mandates.
4. individually concerned safety safety family, take necessary precautions protect yourself. people get vaccinated. can't, wear heavy duty N95 masks, great job filtering sort diseases. make sure keep distance others. Hell, stay home day want.

Saying ""it's fair"" ""it's big deal"" reason implement policy. I'm going support policies expected people inconvenience themselves, providing zero scientific benefit, make others feel better. see problem now.

the problem subject vaccinated not

they vaccinated done, whatever want subject anything.

the subject unvaccinated must wear mask 

see? problem solved. easy it? zoom sessions therapist see face. CDC guidance overwrite science; appears merely acknowledgement low risk vaccinated individuals carrying/transmitting virus. agree things moving much fast. also counterintuitive cannot know encounter street, baseball game, actually vaccinated. left assume, possibly erroneously, \*are\* vaccinated virtue wearing mask, strikes personally risk worth taking. steering well clear maskless individuals vaccinated time.

There's also, course, issue children. South African variant also number us still. There’s preprint shows significantly diminished neutralizing antibody response variant 6 whole picture immune response, still something keep eye on. 1. Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO (worth $4.3 billion)

Well saying it’s crazy, spending time saying it’s important metric. else would person compare death rate with... whatever. 
(*Homer backing hedge .gif*) China could easily 2 million deaths contained outbreak. wonfer includes things children like summer camps schools Fall.  That's stupid. alter society ""what ifs"". 

If there's demonstrable risk time, left individual parents decide risk tolerances. Thank much playing game can't wait see Nunuvut McDavids NHL! Still better Sabres. Although businesses able dictate rules. instance work forcing night shift many us name social distancing. allowed keep going even reopen. They're production, there's advantage safety employees it. garbage. Good luck. national Covid vaccination tracking system. flimsy CDC reminder cards easily copied. country leadership powerful clueless referring paralized actionism failing right thing early enough last year. Yeah, still important call victory early, key there's something people actively incredibly effective, free, available majority people (in US). easily point say ""want pandemic go away? this"". ifs buts mask debates. vaccines work amazingly well matter much someone wants try spin it. sucks world go hell get there. way deaths needed be, people human beings need die. light end tunnel right around corner. 


Next step, countries currently suffering. I'm 25 bit thought losing sense smell alone motivation enough care, level lung damage whatsoever, even small, catch later life. realize replying someone asking proof vaccination? would fact allow enforceable. 2020: Trust science.

2021: Science liar. Trust instead.  Yes obviously. require everyone mass deaths can’t tell bad drivers like can’t tell unvaccinated. guess wasnt useful?? How's situation germany? know percentage means

America would people vaccinated people going get vaccinated. lot anti-vaccine people there. got nothing amount people America vs Canada. Covid recovering offers immunization vaccine

This incorrect. severity Covid affects level immunity. People severe cases Covid higher antibody counts mild cases. Asymptomatic cases even fewer counts. antibodies also diminished quickly time mild everyone caught Covid, whether know not, vaccinated protected

People last summer, mild cases, protected. Medical experts, virologists, epidemiologists, etc recommending people get vaccinated higher likelihood immune system retaining antibodies likelihood asymptomatic spread symptomatic cases managed without trouble

How defining ""managed"" ""without trouble""? Missing days, even weeks, work ""trouble"" many Americans. Even avoid hospital trip, still major setback many Americans virtually nothing savings. We're still expected work remotely end September. thing vaccinated people definition carry minimal risk spreading COVID-19 vaccinated. morons morons short abrupt lockdown, followed universal masks long enough vaccines fully available sounds like reasonable strategy. one people wears mask walking outside myself, explain bit. two separate countries Fall/Winter mask mandates outdoors. thought overkill first too, awhile get pretty used hey, easy enough do, certainly hurting anyone, might even help. Plus never forget one store wherever already wearing it. unvaccinated people take masks flight way differentiate vaccinated unvaccinated people. incredibly unfortunate much vaccine hesitancy due misinformation. know far many people 30-45 age range plans vaccinate. see virus big enough risk them, comprehend herd immunity one bit. Many believe vaccine dangerous virus, absurd.

My wife vaccinated 12 14 year old kids got first dose last week. great feeling know likely protected serious effects, even greater feeling know kids well. Getting covid vaccine patriotic thing even fathom right now. literally saving lives others helping bring us back normalcy. Plus FREE! Ok, [*official government says we're 39% adults Ontario first shot vaccination. sounds like reporter Q&amp;A talking percent eligible (which 55.9%). person that's given thousands injections course last decade...if ain't BD Integra BD Safetyglide brand, want use it. Good job Canada! 🇨🇦 We'll see two months. Southern states summer bump last year summer heat drove people inside A/C. Look Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana predictor fall. lowest vaccine rates country got summer bump last year. Comparing year year 30% vaccine rate help predict happen 60%+ vaccine rate rates states fall. Ironically, place neighborhood take COVID-related signs local CVS. explain thats bad. Also improper administration vaccines cases. I've heard anecdotal reports kids receiving cootie shots showing symptoms weeks later. Turns kids got jabs unlicensed provider jungle gym. Searching records revealed children received one dot, instead recommended two. Others received multiple dots, circles. 


Remember: correct formulation ""circle, circle, dot, dot"". That's 2 circles, 2 dots, *in order*. can't believe still issues decades painstaking research grassroots level. great.

the unvaccinated run get vaccinated vaccinated akin saying ""there risk people killing others drunk driving, ban alcohol everyone"".

Absolute nonsense. think Hawaii avoid large outbreaks, need reach higher level vaccination mainland cases relative rest country. Sort like Washington Oregon slight rise cases couple weeks ago despite high vaccination rates like northeast. curious, what's unenforceable it? Also curious coworker ate dinner person became symptomatic tested positive next day, didn’t get infected symptoms Seems like reasonable middle ground forcing everyone wear masks allowing unvaccinated people go maskless crowded public areas. given Pfizer vaccine $2 per dose part trials far know. rejected doses used Uruguay. analogy 100% proportional. point increased risk sometimes calls increased safety measures. obvious.  Thanks, pointed ""natural immunity"" often last long even provided half dozen sources mods removed post ""high quality"". There's clearly narrative mods trying push appreciate posting high quality content challenges dangerous misguided narrative. Lol saw source ABC instantly knew whatever saying worth less gum picked shoe Africa, every 60 seconds minute passes several studies suggests children adolescents may less commonly infected SARS-CoV-2 exactly justification analogy fair? COVID-19 like playing matches gasoline immunocompromised people, old diseases like lit candle? keep mask call doctor ask. allergies etc.

in case drop steroids can/want keep mask Wearing seatbelt you’re safe driver drive country little directly either. mandating everyone wear one lot. Moved last min said. lets forget;

Unvaccinated people higher risk spreading virus=virus greater risk mutating=mutations higher risk resistant current vaccines.

Minor wording edit. Seems like win win sort situation UK - especially genome sequencing revealing cases Indian variant - probably / widespread countries.

It’s better Danish though would corroborate findings. Science require reproducible results. /s Increased risk sometimes calls increased safety measures. house risk burning kid likes light candles mean take extra steps new guest likes playing matches gasoline?

Covid extremely contagious widespread. Suck COVID! Expect referenced leftist circles nevertheless.  That's funny thing me. Let's say concerns end true cases start rising again. can't CDC just, know, go back old guidelines things start getting bad? assume things go bad beginning argue policies based that? long wear (get vaccinated), danger someone (unmasks without getting vaccinated), even though they're breaking law. lot afraid of. That's fear mongering. suspect quite lot people passports. live pretty international life friends/colleagues, even people know vaccine hesitant massive rush get they're anxious ""secure"" travel rights/ability partake activities involving crowds future.  There's still time.  actual paper title ""School Reopenings, Mobility, COVID-19 Spread: Evidence Texas,"" much unbiased title. Unfortunately media outlets often misrepresent scientific findings, politicization whole pandemic contributing that.

I wish could evaluate science without making every damn thing politics. political issue. part surprised me. think everyone knew old Robert “Papa Bob” Smith Starr,Mississippi going skip vaccine. young people skipping rate alarming. It’s also bit ironic group seems strong opinions how/what rest country concerned with. want generation political favor - don’t group skips vaccine.... Yeah may fine 5 millionth time, still put people risk. Certainly extent unvaccinated person can, I'm sure people even bring constantly. Vaccinated people, even catch COVID, may best get mild cold they're still less likely spread COVID someone who's unvaccinated.

Vaccinated people ones need concerned about. I’m Vegas given casino I’d say it’s 50/50. worn mask since governor removed restrictions last week.  pharma companies talked need yearly boosters I'm guessing kind data suggest wears rather quickly. proven symptoms would range nonexistent mild.

And rare death hospitalization.

Rare, acknowledge them. “Aliens may billions corona related deaths reopening”-source 🤷‍♂️ Yeah nobody rich, getting at. But, variants? Glad British, famously nation teetotalers, stayed dry days following vaccination Duh! People like exhausting. Pandemic US ending. Get it. Assuming you’re authority charge mask mandates business owner. cdc said unvaccinated need wear masks due public health emergency. ensure advice followed?  Exactly. Even short term minor spike cases, cares? Worst case scenario remaining %15-25 population vaccinated acquired immunity naturally, get's sick. 15-25% kids, small minority people risk categories. Furthermore, late spring right now, since virus seems seasonal like flu, cases would trending downward regardless. 

But point, nearly mathematically impossible hospitals could even run covid cases. whole point lockdowns mandates originally, whatever make sure hospitals get overrun. truly following science, covid related lockdowns mandates anywhere US period. over. Yeah, vaccination numbers fantastic lately. great see rush get done. guess brother doesn’t get see kid. It’s bummer sure, he’s playing stupid game, deserves stupid prize. opinion surge vaccination going on? Sure. dealing cancer working avoid transplant rejection, can’t really did. Wow.

I'm already thinking want go summer trip! NY State here. Fully vaccinated, started going back gym. recent CDC guidelines NY mandate changes, fully vaccinated people longer required mask gym. concern know people gym lying fully vaccinated, gym asks attest vaccination status...

My knee jerk reaction continue wear mask anyway help limit potential spread... I'm worried myself, I'm worried could unknowingly pass along someone unvaccinated office whatnot. know risk vaccinated people passing along small... small... silly? That’s common sense… Ah ok, relevant point. We've done lot vaccinations last two weeks. absolutely not

“Don’t care! rules rules.”  ultimate question Outdoor masks probably disappear indoor mask mandate goes. People don’t follow stuff much here. get clear messaging mask mandates (which hold hope mid June especially given increase first dose shots last week) outdoor masks first go followed indoor masks next couple months. accelerate too. first move slow one day you’ll somewhere realize one wearing mask. Exactly ones pre-existing condition covered Phase 1 B January 2021 like diabetes hypertension.  Tens millions people unvaccinated. 3% people immunocompromised vaccine may effective them. kids twelve vaccinated yet. 

Public health emergencies require everyone work together narrowly consider risk. believe spouses allowed in. France 1 2

Its *that* high. Like 7/10 want vaccinated now, rising time. Necessary effectively end pandemic reduce covid cases/deaths negligible levels. take measures safety covid? makes covid different requires precautions weren’t necessary before? Yeah, amnesia. figure personally deal trauma. better define vulnerable populations, makes sense receive booster shots. 

Unless large amount immunity lost time, im thinking booster like yearly flu shot. Something vulnerable elect receive feel higher risk, required attend school. There's plenty people sub fearmongering still, also check r/masks4all  Even less actually. I'm bit salty since really wanna go Switzerland June, high case numbers might put Denmark list countries go there, despite us probably fewer cases EU countries. that's interesting, imo important marker return type ""normalcy"" office buildings/complexes/white-collar workplaces re-open near full capacity. firm still limits ppl twice week on-site, staggered schedules, group meetings held outside courtyard. know there's strong sentiment among professionals keep way rest year. Even though real world data showed good protection hospitalisation death receiving vaccine, still small chance could catch virus vaccine 100% effective, vaccine save lives reduce hospitalisations. Even though vaccinated, still chance could pass people yet received vaccines. get people vaccinated achieve herd immunity gather evidence effectiveness, essential everyone continues follow hands, face, space fresh air measures, get tested twice weekly, whether vaccine not, reduce spread virus. -Dr A- Spreading vaccinated people? unlikely proven symptoms would range nonexistent mild.

Spreading people refuse vaccine lie taking it? That's them. made choice. accept consequences.  you’re definitely right, hope uptake gets better! entire UK fucked then? Canadians broad trust public health systems, generally go way bankrupt patients.

Counterpoint. ones US dont want get vaccinated also likely support hospitals bankrupting patients. hit 4.7 million morning. sure it’s idea mask mandate removed soon kids able get vaccinated 7 day average first shots gone cratering 40,000 15,000 couple weeks back 25,000 last week.

[Oregon considers vaccine passport requirement remove mask businesses not? see many masks driving DC yesterday we've rightfully worried sorts activities year can't flip psychological switch magically worried overnight. scheduled first shot, thought would case wrong. 

Personally, decent amount unpacking I'll okay, say going concert (which something adore sorely miss). think lot people experiencing something similar. problem people chose receive vaccine. States haven’t vaccinated enough individuals yet haven’t acquired CDC’s rules. can’t stop life, anti-vaccine individuals choose receive vaccine. would rather do? Stay locked forever? FWIW, UK little worried.

A vaccinated person likely die choking food Spreading covid whom?

Not vaccinated people, thats sure. vaccines there. already part, everyone else take personal responsibility here. referring people suddenly care rights private businesses comes things agree with, mask requirements vaccine passports. many people like sub, many probably never cared much business rights past. implying people probably problem businesses forced verify vaccination status even want that.

I see post may interpreted differently intended, actually referring people genuinely care business rights. Based comments thread looks like agree subject. Feel modi wave rambling, content-free article, based study dubious conclusion. second paragraphs admits statewide ""virus transmission already high"" *before* schools reopened. article: News Contributor John Brownstein, epidemiologist professor Harvard Medical School, said schools factor contributed spread virus cases, ""I would careful assign direct causality.""

And yet cursory glance Texas covid rates deaths show tracked rest nation regardless school openings, nothing article refutes this. Oh, wonderful news!!! Thank you, made day! “up to”. speak Turkish wrong translation. said expect 70-75% protection still testing don’t know well.

“Up to” false. Get shot.

I absolutely get don’t want wait somewhat return normalcy, curious actually higher risk covid vaccine young person, seems like universal agreement vaccine still far safer. Basically 100 percent haven’t gotten rid mandate yet lol. suspect masks public stores stick around big numbers least another couple months assuming get rid mask mandates near future. Areas like restaurants bars suspect people stop masking much quicker. Nice :)  Ok, that's good source - Canadian government source, though. say 49% Ontarians received first dose, increasing 55.9% eligible.

So question is: Ford plan reopening 80% Ontarians received first dose, 80% ELIGIBLE? That's difference. get beeg Yoshi?  forced look massive numbers deaths injuries, impact wanes. everyone USA could actually see watch 500,000 people die person, response would much different. Noooo really? sure CDC could've issued better specific guidance cases mixing vaccinated &amp; un-vaxed ppl indoors extended period time. probably figure states following guidances adjust rules employees &amp; patrons based case numbers &amp; positivity, states Flyover areas going disregard kind masking altogether point. 

In honesty Infectious Disease Society focusing efforts states already gotten rid masking ordinances. areas lifting mandates prematurely, much lower vaccination rate.  report last updated May 14, 2021 data including May 8, 2021**

It's literally bold print immediately opening link. Here's latest (and Ontario) probably hit 50% population tomorrow, even higher percentage eligible adults get vaccinated, hard. 

I've decided I'm going wear seat belt anymore drive. highway speeds lowered 20mph protect me. can't change nationwide rules protect intentionally ignorant. 

The 3% immunocompromised still benefit vaccine, less. already isolated taking precautions. 

And choose get taking risk own. Cant stop world trying protect people want protected. protects individuals chose get vaccine. Based upon argument would never remove masks guidelines people aren’t going change mind. High risk individuals cannot get vaccine going extra careful common sense. can’t stop life business due individuals high risk. Vaccinated individuals need masked unless crowded indoor settings stated CDC. Covid 99%+ survival rate. It’s time stop living life fear. Ignorance bliss. Thank making morning, morning, thanks bet right. wish people weren’t family… otherwise could feel way fully vaccinated person enter room let’s say 10 times amount virus needed infections dose, pose threat say room say enough virus infectious dose? 

Ultimately curious vaccinated person equally protected situations amount virus particular situation could alter risk accordingly. I'm taking glory hole yet.... cuts down. Things never 100% doesn’t mean don’t can. much effort worth many lives saved? reckon got first jab. Vaccinated context means received necessary amount shots (1 Janssen, 2 AZ mRNA ones). Wait. Canadians compare US? frequent occurrence?  No. stay home safety safety others. Exactly. Testing good, feels like might punished countries. threat vaccinated population body already beat covid, ergo immune. T-Cells people care whether I’m vaccinated  That’s strictly vaccination. Catching Covid recovering offers immunization vaccine. everyone caught Covid, whether know not, vaccinated protected. likelihood asymptomatic spread symptomatic cases managed without trouble, countries immunization status likely far greater think. case counts suspected widely under-reported, too, immunization disease. We’re safer think That's one side cares one doesn't. says 68% PA adults least one dose. country go maskless give people impression Covid don’t need vaccinate. “I’m vaccinated, it’s me”

Almost America’s problems boil [“I don’t know explain care Stay home then. I’d rather live. whole family already covid, natural immunity. covid wasn’t bad- fine. understand survivor bias too. extended family vaccine covers them. grandparents would rather live take risk vaccination sit home miss seeing great grandchildren. don’t believe evidence sufficient determine boosters yet. Uh huh. sent vaccines place world think something different?  ""offers protection"" except protection need offers nearly perfect protection. Peers within discipline. Nuclear physicists, academic historians epidemiologists scientists, there's much point letting review other's publications. evidence mutations strains stopped current vaccine? Every time hear new variant find days later vaccine works it. Surely it’s mathematical possibility new variant work around vaccine. probable? Stupid people harm many different ways.  That’s rule it’s time return normal. Everyone needs vaccinated testings need happen large events. vaccination inoculates COVID, inoculates threat others stupidity. Unfortunately pandemic brought worst people life death time. Man, learned way crayons expected thread. know delicious. Unvaccinated masking lot however. propose ensure stay masked, per cdc guidance? Honor system doesn’t work won’t implementing vaccine passports. can't wait free sample lunch again....almost makes fighting weekend crowds Costco worth it. would nice see pressure US Federal Government northern states Canadian goverment. study found group 3 million insured US patients ages 18 64, **2.8 percent** immunosuppressive drugs.

Thats actually right would guessed. health never great. 

Does mean can't take vaccine? effective everyone else's would? I'm tribes, seems like fallen one. I'm bioinformatics scientist purely evaluating situation based data, job. I've even advised CDC pandemics/bioterrorism past (2008, ignored suggestions could've really prevented lot death, maybe pandemic response team got fired 2018). However, case one two tribes seems wrong issues root cause much death USA Canada parallel/equivalent parties there. Try apply biases people's posts inherently there, helps discussion getting real information. tough scientist everyone tries spin analysis biased truly nothing sort.

I get though. Texas bad. look way excuse early surges places, Texas top5 bad. look last 7 days, even worse. Cool. Yeah, look things different ways, make different places look better/worse comparison others. Look, I’m Canadian. don’t really care country’s obsession tribes. boring. government source says 39.05% eligible adults Ontario first dose, whch big difference. getting data 80%? doubt children 12 compose 50% population. well, right stats... want virus keep running rampant un-vaccinated population. people actually can't get vaccine, though rare, protecting them. also, want thing mutate escape immunity vaccine itself, happens people choose vaccinated certainly better Texas's response snow!. thought 200 million Americans vaccinated? one dumbest slippery slope arguments I've seen.

Masking allows us *end* lockdown get step closer normal. following science you’re vaccinated, even cdc says resume normal wear mask..I’m one saying it, cdc side effects mild short-term, lasting longer week, everyone gets them. include sore arm injected vaccine, feeling tired, headache, feeling achy, feeling sick. Public Health England continue monitoring side effects long term. Getting Covid-19 far dangerous vaccine, millions vaccinated vaccine saved thousands lives.
Every single vaccine available authorised UK regulatory body (the MHRA), including safety assessment, effectiveness assessment manufacturing quality assessment. vaccines safe effective.


 -Dr A-  case numbers start going back change guidance. Thus far happening. Reality simple: we're point significant number people vaccinated (partial fully), mask enforcement almost unattainable.

What we're left covid remaining ""mild"" among vaccinated, passing groups un-vaccinated people -- enough care capacity them. Nah, really. US CDC reasonably cautious, reopenings materially delayed people upvoting posts whatever. need able look away posts. Science matters. That’s must ensure unvaccinated stay masked up. honor system work. Vaccine passports implemented. solution continue masking indoors high risk situations now, vaccination rates high enough, spread low enough, etc. Take poor person's gold.🥇 CDC guidelines state unvaccinated people unmasked public.

Big signs stating escalated disagreement employees masking vaccination requirements mean instant banning park, trespassing charges filed possible jail time and/or fines. Nonsense tolerated. like drive by. still go TSA checkpoints 20 years 9/11 people still fly frequently. Adapt stop complaining. one mean someone thinks states overbearing lockdowns policies driven data overall handled better, yup ...one those.  could months ago; yea. frankly, I'm going go digging now. genuinely thought common knowledge since CDC every medical expert telling people previously Covid still needed get vaccinated. listed timeframe 3 months infection, telling first responders could wait little 2 weeks mild cases. There's lot information subject, much made peer review yet. studies suggest previous infection grants immunity, seen one quantitatively compares vaccination immunity kind antibody count. 

As long current medical advice telling post-infection Covid people go ahead get vaccinated, prevailing theory apparently grant immunity levels enough get us herd immunity reasonable time frame.

Sorry, correct you. formula **their own** infants :( I’m saying risk low masks mandates, even lower vaccines. chances sitting next unvaxxed covid+ person minimal. live efficacy/effectiveness (VE) measured calculating risk disease among vaccinated unvaccinated persons determining percentage reduction risk disease among vaccinated persons relative unvaccinated persons. greater percentage reduction illness vaccinated group, greater vaccine efficacy/effectiveness. basic formula written as:

No, wrong. Vaccine effectiveness/efficacy (which used interchangeably CDC article) calculated risk reduction vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people. exactly said efficacy/effectiveness interpreted proportionate reduction disease among vaccinated group. 90% indicates 90% reduction disease occurrence among vaccinated group, 90% reduction number cases would expect vaccinated.

That mean ""10% cases vaccinated people"". difference ""efficacy"" ""effectiveness"" ""effectiveness"" works general population, calculated way efficacy is. remember used snipers.

For reference, got first AZ shot yesterday since got tired waiting mRNA vaccines come country, all. I’m curious you’ve got reasons preferring AZ mRNA. Yep, people always seem forget transmission exponential case growth requires infected person expose sufficient number potential vectors (i.e., people) virus. person vaccinated stopped potential infected person well potential vector. ever increasing number vaccinated people means ever decreasing chance unvaccinated ever potentially exposed catching (not even counting immunity, matter small, present already it).

It’s high vaccination rates, it’s unvaccinated white people comparing wear mask racism, happens far often should.  40-60% lower referencing vaccinated people *who become infected* compared unvaccinated infected person. vaccines also reduce odds infected first place, even greater number. 95% efficacy numbers clinical trials symptomatic disease we've found tons evidence vaccines also greatly reduce asymptomatic infection. looking 85-95% lower chance infected first place, 50% lower chance infected vaccinated person transmit disease, giving 92-97% reduction transmission vaccinated people. Cants say didn’t try tell them, feel bad can’t take actual medical reason infrigin muh freedoms crowd. got J&amp;J silly all. Either way, fully vaccinated want continue considerate others, case, power you. country suffered way folks considerate others daily basis. 

The gym road (NY) promoted culture masks whole time (yes many spread covid) fit healthy somehow decided meant good concern others behave accordingly. exactly attitude public health officials take issuing guidelines. 

Here's better way putting it: bunch folks lived like monks 14 months protect ass. Enough enough. Keep quoting CDC confirms said. don’t understand interpret definitions. Let us think second. pfizer/moderna trials 95% efficacy prevent symptomatic infection. trial occurred time SD mask wearing relatively low covid rates trial occurred winter surge. can’t remember efficacy seniors believe slightly 90. CDC study showed NYtimes said 94% reduction among hospitalizations. means symptomatic infection much higher age group studied believe less 20% hospitalized (though don’t data that). Therefore real world among seniors vaccine efficacy much lower 95% preventing symptomatic infection. Also keep mind vaccines new. long term data much opportunity breakthrough cases especially people live normally without precautions. important everyone (who least infected) vaccinated lower chance virus spread would rare get outbreak vaccinated community likely community half vaccinated. important keep mask mandates. 
Let add one last example help understand vaccine effectiveness. one contagious covid pt cause outbreak setting 100 people 50% vaccinated ten total infections one vaccinated would mean 90% efficacy. However ten contagious covid people went setting infect 75/100 people 25/75 vaccinated, efficacy drops 50%. point vaccine efficacy depends community spread therefore masks help reduce spread isn’t enough immunity.  5G sucks got vaxx.. maybe got placebo effective vaccine Covid achieve herd immunity. vaccines flu work well (as flu dna reassorts). hundreds deaths would unnecessary deaths Covid allowed continue spread. went 2 games. never required got seat LOL know long term effects Please provide source this, information I've seen CDC suggests case. point making cases reported. height covid-19, nobody going Dr. Unless urgent. also seeing huge spike cancer cases people avoided going Dr recently. Lots "" found lump 6 months ago I'm vaccinated show doc"" Question recent AMA - understand doctor UK. made distinction advice given directly contradicts advice following US. 

I surprised see advice wonder anyone else surprised well.

This said response question wearing masks though real world data showed good protection hospitalisation death receiving vaccine, still small chance could catch virus vaccine 100% effective, vaccine save lives reduce hospitalisations. Even though vaccinated, still chance could pass people yet received vaccines. get people vaccinated achieve herd immunity gather evidence effectiveness, essential everyone continues follow hands, face, space fresh air measures, get tested twice weekly, whether vaccine not, reduce spread virus. -Dr A- hahahahaha mean yeah, shit. 

All it. folks wanted get jabbed, gotten jabbed. would make perfect sense. works way viruses. husband caught flu years ago, doctor tested us, showed positive, didn’t feel symptoms, probably I’d flu shot already. think accepted Covid-19 eradicated anytime soon. question world get endemic state, enough return ""normal?"" opinion yes, endemic, seasonal state, Covid-19 outlier compared infectious diseases, whole much impact people live lives. 

Also, article mostly based hypotheticals, bringing SA variant really looked deeply. AZ study particularly long essentially abandoned early J&amp;J showed quite effective it, see MRA vaccines be. mean risk astronomically low J&amp;J carries similar risk blood clotting yet willingness take much higher AZ, yet AZ far effective. talking people think covid vaccine protect covid? months ago. Children getting often cases mild. variants much better targeting them. Yeah, shit. That's vaccine makers continue adjusting vaccines combat mutations going forward.

The point article substantially government's scientific advisers say COVID may continue evolve years come ""eradication extremely unlikely"".  document, considers long-term plan COVID jabs, says ""loss vaccine effectiveness result economic social costs"" **""a solution update vaccines keep pace virus evolution""**.

Which think people disagree with. vaccines going need evolve people still need get vaccinated future. get COVID-19 hurt themselves. Unfortunately there’s also people can’t get vaccine actual medical reasons they’ll also effected choice. one deserves die, even making irrational choices.

I hope changes mind somehow. religious? Political? Conspiracy? 25¢ per day, send us $1.75 week family situation here. Seeing families chose vaccination get together Mother’s Day real punch gut. you’re vaccinated still worry...i worry majority population enough shit life keep track what's going vaccines multiple countries stopped AZ vaccines EU changes advise constantly.

I mean today changed it: understandable course see headlines get feeling like safe vaccines.

And can't blame people keeping date either. mean whole corona thing incredible mental drain bad news top bad news top bad news. stopped watching press conferences keeping date well. sleep better night something important I'll see news otherwise care anymore.

I would prefer Pfizer Moderna gut feeling tells safer get letter go get vaccination AZ, oh well, fine well. lost family thing certain point shrug shoulders. ""If go outside, die."" ""No one tells do!"" Every branch tree someone refusing get vaccinated I'm sure ground over. reality colleges always required vaccines people complained ""draconian"" before. unfortunate specific vaccine heavily politicized. twin daughters, turn 15 next month, got first Pfizer shot today! One lot anxiety hoping help eventually feel comfortable going back normal life soon. Hurt feelings tried digging see could find anything too. want avoid confirmation bias obviously critical articles aligned viewpoint... seems protected 8 months infection. Afterwards, wonder really happens makes us susceptible again... antibodies “use lose it” kind thing? I’m wondering research reveal greater accuracy timeframe. don’t envy people trying measure stuff, seems insanely complicated understanding children weren’t impacted way adults basically common cold type symptoms. Sure tested long term, 10 month course chemo designed kill things. preservatives long history safety, mRNA wrapped lipid. mRNA simply stick around body. basically worried potential long term effects spike protein makes. stick around long either, since immune system attacks it, without rest pathogen, can't diddly squat. spike proteins going show much larger force exposed virus. exposed thousands similar proteins pathogens regular. mention fragile can't stay \~8 degrees C hours breaks useful.

Do know long term effects 100% certainty? No. know unlikely any, based understanding way vaccine works. comparison, risk probably lower risk take eating hotdog, certainly smoking cigarette, eating much salt, etc.

I get know, unless literally living life like saint avoid risks, one drop big bucket comparison every risk life. care. point arguing person. Lets keep sick individuals locked inside never let leave homes he's tired inconvenienced. fact tries comparing risks immunocompromised persons going catching cold vs catching COVID laughable. That's crazy, considering millions people concerned this... 

I'm Canada open work permit since beginning pandemic, initially allowed back outrage caused, allowed established immigrants (with job address basically) come back in. thought US same. world's longest lockdown? Beginning week March 1st, total deaths US within 1-2% 5 year historical average. Total deaths 2020 approximately 15.6% higher recent history, according CDC.

I love indicator requires assumptions testing capacity, false positives, cause death, herd immunity. 

Simply put, number people dying week US non-pandemic years. difficult think unambiguous indicator normal life ready resume. I’m speech pathologist, say I’ve seen uptick referrals kids speech, language social skills concerns :( Considering case rate US low, maybe Canada reconsider quarantine rules, allow people access available vaccines US. people vaccinated good Canada. 

This seems extreme, seems like meant earlier times lot Covid cases US:

""Maximum penalties failing comply mandatory quarantine rules travellers returning Canada include fine $750,000 and/or imprisonment six months."" feel like cases young people dying almost always having: a) pre-existing condition, b) hospitals overloaded/not proper PPE, c) improper treatment (ie: early reliance ventilators), d) obesity.   would seem vaccines don’t stop transmission spread amongst 9 vaccinated people group. I’m understanding things like lowering mask mandates idea vaccine passports doesn’t stop transmission. Yeah!!!!!!!!  say? Wow that's amazing!  Spanish flu WAY worse. killed much young people factor population size, killed higher percentage people. think US would need like 3.5 times amount COVID deaths equal many people died Spanish flu. That's roll eyes see headlines like COVID killing people number. Like duh, much bigger population size. scale things.  NY overpopulated people don’t respect personal space. mask blessing random coughs near subway. New Bedford still 🤦‍♀️

Ffs, need get information Portuguese, still ton people speak English Spanish Younger people likely think virus affects old people live lives normal way. also likely essential jobs. I'm denier lol, know lockdowns took toll society. lockdowns nearly destroyed small business. Like said, event giant tragedy, perfect moves could made pandemic. need understand goal lockdowns save lives surges, absolutely did. came price course since life complicated always perfect decision made. We're war dude everyone suffers war. swallow American entitlement realize made sacrifices last year. fully vaccinated! Yep, here's NJ's required vaccine schedule pre-school. Yes couldn’t see schools singled whole state reopened precautions? makes good headline, study flawed.

And swears vaccines dangerous kids vaccinated. risk get sick low, want get sick all. Moreover, want miss 2 weeks school/camp.

Also, want cases flare community thing get dragged longer. urging everyone know get vaccinated, we're quite yet. Yes better. worth it? It’s you. CDC said it’s worth everyone masked mass transit, hospitals, prisons, etc. personally believe it’s worth crowded indoor situations least get large boost herd immunity kids vaccinated around September. layperson means expert thus look experts guidance explanation. 

From start explained experts wearing mask COVID-19, stopping amount virus exhaled mouth nose (i.e. protecting around you) much protecting wearer. Early explained wear one wear one me.

That unless one wears real NIOSH N95 name describes stops 95% particulate inhaled wearer. 

Now, folks wearing N95s instead wearing paper cloth masks understanding protecting around yourself. 

So ask, maybe missing something, vaccinated (or anyone) going continue something protect (assuming wearing NIOSH N95), protect others potentially endangering (even potential low vaccinated)?

To clear, trying besmirch call out, see going continue wearing mask even vaccinated understand thinking openly admit expert maybe missing something.  women got special privileges work home due lack childcare..

That completely illegal. man struggled child care issues sue daylights company. IfI COVID. need get natural infection seem provide immunity, studies suggest short term: Protection wane 90 days post-infection, says Dr. Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor adult pediatric infectious diseases Baylor College also know enough yet well natural immunity protects variants virus, hand, says, ""currently available vaccines United States[from Pfizer, Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson] provide robust immunity lasts minimum six months — vaccines date shown clinical efficacy variants concern.""  Yes many cases people getting COVID even one two doses vaccine India. Also doctors fully vaccinated passed away due COVID. Many nurses fully vaccinated also got COVID passes children. possible? Thank this!

1. report seems discredited obesity lessen vaccines effectiveness. thoughts possibility?

2. percentage population needs one dose significant reduce transmission virus? Two doses?

3. recently outbreak 8 cases vaccinated coaches player Yankees baseball team NYC. one case symptomatic. seems weren’t required follow masking distancing 85% team vaccinated. assumption fully vaccinated plus 2 weeks required though exact dates weren’t reported. vaccinated time place.
How common think asymptomatic outbreaks be? may caught required testing. cause concern anyone vaccinated? high risk cases?

I many questions. Please answer (or none) appeals you. greatly appreciate time know number questions. Thank you. CDC guidance vaccinated people don’t need wear masks social distance though really strange....I went Target last night, employee wearing mask, everyone else was. almost second guess wonder lifting mask mandate dream. little uncomfortable TBH I'll still go maskless Target.

I'm healthy fit person 20s vaccinated worn mask everyone around year now. would like actually live hit 30. selfish me? think so. I've done could everyone around still am. think selfish making everyone still drop lives indefinitely this. Schools always. I'm parent low income family school this, yes complain there's much do. definitely agree government/school board make schools safer often consciously choose to. Hot licks guitar thing saw thing Michigan. 

Schools reopened cases skyrocketed. It’s coincidence. science say myocarditis Pfizer vaccine, terms data mechanism (if one)? fan smart/dumb distinction, see concerned population general smarter not. Sure think things terms ones risk COVID decimated healthcare workforce, supply chains, infrastructure, markets. desire people contribute society taking extremely low threshold steps masking getting increasingly documented safe vaccination something consider. life way live literally depending health safety others able work create things need maintain current lifestyle.  think article solid, balanced analysis mask study. that's based percentages rather total population.

""Well U.S. big country can't compare together""

There's excuse U.S. lag behind vaccine administration. vaccines available, *we hoarded months*. 


I'm gonna get deep particular subsection Americans refuse get vaccine. know deserve every contempt face. best time vaccinated COVID infection immunological point view? Maximizing protection vs minimizing side effects? pros cons getting vaccination earlier / later?  think misinterpreting comment.

Every time see complaints ""Fauci government lied us masks early on, government can't trusted!!11!1!!"", I'm thinking ""Give break, Joe Public's given Fauci experts government *every reason* faith them."" Pot calling kettle, pal.  CDC:

Data surface survival studies indicate 99% reduction infectious SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses expected typical indoor environmental conditions within 3 days (72 hours) common non-porous surfaces like stainless steel, plastic, glass 10, 11, 12, 13, 15.

Oregon government trying appear ""Tough health"" move zero consequences since one politicians know works retail.

This move effectively saying mask mandate remaining notice. imagine stores want check vaccination cards because, again, lead complications pretty quickly, leaving everyone seen simpler solution. fair goes CDC statement *vaccinated individuals need wear masks.*

I'm frustrated move Chicago New Jersey explicitly keeping masks indefinitely. getting ridiculous. you’re right - anecdotal evidence never really prove anything statistics have. guess I’ve mainly worrying data I’ve looked don’t really show levels exposure vaccinated people caught vs people didn’t. maybe haven’t able find it.

My hope asking people’s personal experiences make feel real point feel like it’s psychological adjustment rather physical one. It’s even peer reviewed Yeah, totally wait small cohort people fine many years, like H1N1, polio, cowpox vaccinia smallpox, or... oh wait. that.

Vaccination willingness high before, vary corona vaccine, behavioral survey RIVM GGDs showed Friday. 90 percent surveyed said would vaccinated. According survey, willingness take Pfizer vaccine highest AstraZeneca's vaccine least sought after. 
Most nearly 55,500 survey participants say take Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccine invited so. 81 percent let known would willing take Pfizer vaccine, compared 74 percent Moderna. 
AstraZeneca's corona vaccine would least sought after: 53 percent participants said would get shot received invitation mail. Janssen pharmaceutical's corona vaccine, percentage 66 percent. 
However, mean rest people would get vaccinated vaccine question. participants said still doubt. percentage saying would vaccinated specific vaccine highest AstraZeneca (28 percent) lowest Pfizer (11 percent). 
Pfizer Moderna vaccine effective according participants 
Those surveyed believe Pfizer Moderna's vaccines effective fewest side effects. ""In reality, protection serious illness COVID-19 infection vaccines (above 85 percent effectiveness),"" RIVM said. 
Respondents least concerned possible side effects Pfizer Moderna vaccines. 23 percent 25 percent, respectively, afraid them. participants say fear possible side effects AstraZeneca (45 percent) Janssen (34 percent). 
AstraZeneca's Janssen's vaccines linked rare side effect vaccinated people developed platelet deficiency combined severe form thrombosis. rare side effect, AstraZeneca's vaccine used people sixty Netherlands. 
What risk severe thrombosis vaccination AstraZencea? 
By May 9, one half million AstraZeneca shots administered Netherlands. 
In total, Lareb side effects center received fifteen reports serious side effect: that's 1 100,000. 
To compare: everyone (from young old) city Venlo vaccinated, average one person would affected side effect. 
Twelve women three men reported, nine sixty years old six sixty. 
Since people sixty given vaccine, side effects center received three reports (out million vaccines given). 
Do questions rare side effect? so, ask comments. 
Janssen reduces risk rare side effects 
That risk even smaller Janssen, medicine authority EMA ruled earlier. United States, 9.6 million doses Janssen vaccine administered side effect detected 30 vaccinated persons. small number, according EMA, reason halt administration Janssen vaccine restrict certain age groups. 
The Janssen vaccine yet administered often Netherlands (about 70,000 times) Lareb aware reports serious side effect last week. 
Compliance measures vaccination 
Compared previous round measurements end March, willingness vaccinated risen 4 percentage points, RIVM noted. Never study many people indicated would like vaccinated. difference willingness vaccinated especially noticeable compared November survey: time 33 percent wanted vaccinated, lowest willingness far. 
It appear, however, vaccinated people increasingly unwilling comply corona measures. ""This particularly true socially restrictive measures, keeping distance limiting number people get together with,"" RIVM said. 
Although agencies emphasize vaccinated persons must also abide rules, 34 percent expect keep distance others vaccination 40 percent longer expect abide maximum number visitors. 25 year old im also confused age group skipping vaccine. got soon could. One point add on: virus circulating population means variants, means likely variant evolves longer protected vaccine. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Next time go Cali, I'm going Lost Coast. 

Last time tried, 25' sets coming in, ranger like way going back camp. 

We still made beach above, totally safe, hell chore, mind bogglingly beautiful. 

From Colorado point view. lmao love downvoted reddit bizarrely ""America bad! Canada good!"" basically meme. mean maybe future, drugmakers CDC handling that. guidance right get vaccinated remove mask choose. They're still convinced we're going see 4th wave la Osterholm's ""eye hurricane"" etc get 80% vaxxed whatever read soups voice. above. :-( I'm vaccinated planning travel couple weeks. I'm worried virus. I'm much worried Miami airport Florida Man come throw bunch sharp microchips face screaming 5G. Anything identity. It’s like sports teams - people don’t support team it’s best-performing team, people support team it’s *my* team *obviously team best team it’s team goddammit*

When politics becomes team sport, surprising people treat like team sport? 1. States asked permission acquire vaccines themselves.
2..All vaccines approved FDA allowed India. cumulative incidence curve, (far 50%) protection symptom onset starts around day 11, implying protection infection starting week. protection (and countries seen increases rate infection within period people relax viral load (~contagiousness) people drops dramatically around day 11 first dose. implies protection infection bit earlier, noteworthy much larger sample size.

Personally extra careful week first dose, started relaxing (which surprisingly difficult). think tough position. 

Ultimately, accept premise that: (approved) vaccine X% efficacy preventing infections (the data certainly supports Pfizer least) Y% population take (or access, etc), might trouble isn’t enough reach herd immunity metrics, inhibit zoonotic transmission, etc etc. 

If X isn’t 100%, can’t rely relatively selfish game ‘me mine safe’, behooves keep restrictions extent you’ve sufficiently suppressed disease spread relative herd immunity levels. 

That said, hope doesn’t require constant masks two week tests. get everyone vaccinated (X near 100) done Imagine butthurt something zero impact you.... Announced today:
 
The pledges made include 1 billion doses American pharmaceutical company Pfizer German company BioNTech’s, 200 million Johnson &amp; Johnson 100 million Moderna. provided cost low-income countries low profit middle-income countries.
 
Pfizer BioNTech pledged additional 1 billion next year, European Union nations promised another 100 million doses year. advice UK going by, US idea vaccinated people infect others taken seriously. Yeah people hyper focused vaccines rates still little low. account population affect therefore protection, amount people covered US pretty high. - said, ignoring facts completely. black people 22% vaccinated okay, reasons. white people leading everyone vaccinations problem? sound racist. That's hear. know quite native Japanese willing give tour least kick right direction. Can't go Japan without climbing Mt. Fuji either. started saving trip years ago, COVID hit, start ground zero assuming become gainfully employed again, may another couple years. considering COVID, may bad idea give least year two anyhow. feel almost uncontrollable urge buy Surface laptop? UK lot surge testing variant affected areas, infections may also actively looking them. Rare, yes. I'm worried long COVID kids. would suck lost taste smell permanently cognitive losses. curiosity, reaction?

One dose mRNA effective one dose vaccine, including J&amp;J. also suspect booster desirable point, making second dose one month bit waste. COVID before, one dose effective two doses without infection (there tremendous amount research supporting this).

But risk level also depends current prevalence. prevalence keeps dropping 25% week risk drop quite measurably. No, flagrant lying. Venezuela 2.4k deaths Colombia healthcare system confirmed 83 thousand. Iran called repeatedly politicians doctors understating multiple Russia deliberate underreporting scale hundreds thousands each. countries counts, publish bull. feeling way live well (the UAE). Travel predicated silly metrics like active case count new cases completely dependent country's willingness ability test widely. would incentivize countries testing lot halve tests. [The White House COVID Response director announced partnership dating apps promote display vaccination status 14% likely get match.""

As humorous aside, carefully watch Fauci's face reacts announcement. interestingly hand gesture Trump conference featured Deep State, he's containing amusement. Yeah money politics messed vaxed safe care? literally nonevent kids... young healthy adults.  circle safe, made choice reservation?

It factually \*not\* ""non-event"" young, healthy adults. would write high percentage long-term (and perhaps permanent) damage brain, lungs, circulatory systems, even among asymptomatic patients. would write \*a lot\* people young otherwise healthy undergoing treatments chemo, people accounts live high likelihood contracting covid. would mention vaccines work immune system doesn't, chemotherapy immunosuppressant. would mention large populations unvaxxed people serve petri dish new, potentially vaccine-resistant, forms covid could potentially arise (and idiots feather flock together, say). would write much money resources freeloaders sucking away people need actually deserve care (since feds picking tab covid treatment).

I would write things, already know. fifteen months excuse idiocy selfishness. course  likely reopening push getting parents back work next quarter's numbers pumped up. pretend US government families' best interests heart. grandma flew Vietnam Boston 3 months ago came fine. required brought negative covid test (covid test result within 24 hours departure). family citizen, permanent resident.

And get vaccine weeks arrived. realize glass half empty way looking thing 40-60% change anything also 40-60 % chance inverse know math.... underestimate power convenience.

Exactly. Drive-thru voting boosted voter turnout Houston last election... precisely certain groups already planning ban it. Given tourists likely attending Olympics masse, economic incentive really substantial japanese government? sure love making nonsensical replies. bad kids aren’t eligible yet. wear masks wear one too.  right. apologies. people realize pool possible hosts spread virus. Even get sick every transmission elevates risk virus mutating strain current vaccines effective. already South African, Brazilian, UK, whatever strains there. 

There tolerance people want vaccinated. children need vaccinated too. don't, sooner later, strain develop makes children sick even die. That's evolution works. narrow group virus mutate within specific group become effective multiplying unpredictable consequences. Everything disproportionally affects women constant victim mentality. Okay long? Antibodies developed vaccines won’t last long. Even tedros said vaccines silver bullet. another wave. pandemic permanent. destined doomed. This!! It’s stupid people act like “I’m tough! great immune system!” yet completely ignore long term effects covid. Loss smell big deal. I’ve read stories many redditors covid sense smell slowly started return, everything smells disgusting now.

I'm also anti-masker, I've worn one necessary I've never gotten used it. comfortable. I've tried 20 different types masks, ones people recommended enjoy it, especially 95 degrees outside. miserable. understand purpose wear one necessary certain point enough enough. much testing doing. tests run, accurate % positive (also likely higher % positive less testing cause itll mostly sicker people tested).

""OK, I'll get vaccine"" That’s thing. 

Ok let’s say I’m vaccinated (I am, situation I’m not). Ok enter mask, gonna keep saying “passport, please” whenever see staff member? Dude. Learn stop, geez.

You replying people directly experienced loss children telling fucking rare, wrong you.

It's right, read room goddamn. USA doesn’t entire segment population (everyone 34 years old) completely unvaccinated. It’s problem Uk since people generally hang people age whole summer think small percentage population keep getting immunity old fashioned way.

It's like entire half Alabama vaccinated immunity, even didn't, they're gonna get once.

The pandemic US over. saying? elderly mother hospital right pacer replaced. condition life-threatening get worse. doctor recommended wait hospitals, matter hard try keep covid our, risk chances surviving infection small.  Could J&amp;J single-shot, advantage vaccine could make attractive also stop private businesses asking medical info (e.g., vaccination status disability precludes masking up) stop people shouting it! suspect summer vaccinations remain high many universities requiring vaccines students. 30,000 daily new Covid cases

That's lot cases. may right. may indeed Queen Canada.  several real world studies shown mask mandates effective. may disagree methodology instead choose quibble exact degree effectiveness, state real world evidence demonstrably Survival fittest, bitches! seems like mostly threat developing nations - would like think we're point states step up. pandemic feels like almost states mean that's reality rest world, ability help.

no?

I three year old can't begin express concerned social development year cooped bunch adults. can't even imagine toll taken school-aged kids (especially lower income communities).

Thanks actually reading article Non-sourced data, graphs without axis, anecdotal info - dude - really need learn find actual data blog. sound like someone living cancer cluster understand stats make cancer clusters happen - they're anomaly outlier - thing happens get big numbers non-even spread likelihood.

Please provide actual sourced info I'm going block you. I'm going waste time facebook warriors. enough family members understand difference memes news. Economist 8 12. Guess us scientists warning stuff basic logic data (which countries like Israel) right all. Despite crapped every day last summer. insane CDC put 39 reference article day Jr. pushed reopening still can't update science many diseases? whole past year highlights ineptitude shitty governing bodies decision making crisis. service dog highly trained. random animal. far could tell, tracking vaccine type/brand lot number. card indicate reason hold onto Dumb Americans thinking health private matter kind surprised this, NV went ""honor system"" week two back, number waitresses/bartenders local establishments still masked take vax.

I'm sure say ""but come tons unintended consequences"". say, thank proving point original comment.

Public health balancing risks benefits, making risk 0. feel lot people COVID19 completely obliterated ability accurately gauge risk think make activity 0 risk. think right. would make sense given Fenway opening fully soon Gillette. asked week ago would've said 100% CDC announcement last Friday gym go (large chain) dropped 5% masked local grocery store opposite, maybe 5% unmasked. went bar first time year 100% unmasked.

We’ve apart year put covid infected ushers section. actually forgot dropped verified specialist part flair add fully vaccinated part haha. yeah headline need confirmation bias. work oilsands. people know live country Canadian snowbirds. Lockdowns = stop hospitals overwhelmed? Yes. 

But masks. don’t think many people really believe that. It’s easy prevention method lower infections.  news, sky blue cancer kills would bet loudest antivaxers (eg: Tucker Carlson) already got vaccine. dunno, article says many times *seems* dont spread easily *in single household*, lots caveats, theres data extrapolated SARS-CoV-2 transmission outside home children tend make social contacts adults,"" authors cautioned. Kids borderline risks respect COVID-19, research far.

People can't get vaccines medical reasons always protect diseases. treat COVID-19 differently disease? never masking requirements prevent people receive vaccines past. case effort purely performative though. Wearing mask you’re vaccinated nothing directly. got shitfaced drunk night first dose back January pure joy. seems stupid, given new information... issue don’t know long term implications Covid kids. might complications 10 years now. Think shingles. That's even kind true. business required check status want allow people go mask less. want check status, business runs last year. mask mandate effectively active way around it. know, I'm bit scientist myself. states, caring gun anywhere actually perfectly allowed. terrible example. Again, I'll point millionth time: point mask mandates lockdowns never prevent spread sort COVID-19. point measures prevent spread enough prevent hospitals overwhelmed. entire argument ""flattening curve"" year ago.

Yes, policy likely cause COVID-19 spread unvaccinated people lie take advantage it. unless hospitals risk overwhelmed, that's problem. goal measures never COVID-19 spread, CDC knows that, hence gave recommendation. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

We're going wear masks forever. safe vaccinated people take now. Anxiety drives public policy. Thanks time!

This lockdown etc pretty tough I'm money pay taxes etc

Have thought payment taking vaccine? I'm trying hardball uk gov here, price \~£10,000. 

I feel like it'd reallty help vaccine hesitancy. another £5k I'd willing pretend enjoyed too. I’d argue that’s political way remove liability themselves. essentially handed states. brings fear you’re allowing politicians make decisions regarding pandemic. Even it’s based science individuals take actions like Cuomo New York hide cases amplify case amount could destructive country. That’s entirely different discussion though. love people talking 99.x percent survival rate us normal people afraid virus. Well dudes, 5% chance getting $10k bigger medical bill. one day's stay going huge, uninsured, financial wreckage. FaceBook needs remove real benefit. would massive win planet. equivalent DEA taking group picture coke money low-level bust publicity. Polling places, yes.
 
But yeah, course limited exceptions ""anywhere"".    I'm scientician. Per source: ""The cumulative percent population received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine Ontario 39.05%, May 8, 2021.""

So old info Ontarians, adults only. seem surreal though. hard explain why. guess level weird small thing would make thing I've spent last year+ taking great measures avoid go away. Like chased tiger year scare away rubber band something.

Don't get wrong, took first time slot could can't wait get back normal. still strange feeling. thanks fish could done Americans taken virus seriously instead politicizing mandates fighting other. Yeah sorry I’m gonna feel bad wanting masked sessions literally forever. I’m trying make anything, find it’s ever going believe problem lies you

It doesn’t, thanks.   Well, seems beat reading comprehension. point even voiced personal stance opinion? no, simulations hold standard example challenge study

Tegnell stated mask decision would made evidence based science
This article make evidence based conclusion

Everything else off-topic Riiight. took year half so. *face palm* least complete. 

Cali closing beaches butt jokes forever. stop single transmission distanced strangers, sea breezes.  Breaking news! Dopes still dopes guess we’ll see happens, may element seasonality covid also playing role cases going down, may emerge among unvaccinated people fall winter. God hope not. concern is, think, due mixing ground tourists everywhere. want extra sure state good, tourists around world give other. NYT still considers places average 0.2 cases per day (in case 0.7 cases per 100k population) ""Medium Risk"" category COVID risk map. also consider hospitalization rate stat ignoring factor vaccine keeping cases mild.

We're going end situation pandemic effectively ended risk grade still says moderate risk _everywhere_ due poorly they've implemented this.  hope I’m picking sarcasm... would imagine decades ago, Americans refused buckle less concerned accident.  


Stupidity generational redundant, saying thing twice! ensure wear mask? Bit boo boo reopening everything without analysis outcomes reopening schools? shit. misreading data, amount people Ontario one dose, adults. Additionally, distinction adults eligible, metrics tracked - recently broadened definition eligible include 12-16 year olds.  real question? can’t racist white people. new study conducted patient advocacy group LongCovidSOS, collaboration Dr David Strain University Exeter Medical School Dr Jeremy Rossman University Kent, surveyed 800 people symptoms vaccination. Based study, half participants long covid symptoms reported improvements jab. However, research can't say certain whether vaccines ease long covid symptoms, whether people simply recovering period time. studies need done confirm randomised controlled trial. COVID vaccine however reduce chances getting covid therefore, prevent getting long covid. -DR A- Weed ftw lol David Leonhardt literally posting positive COVID news months (in fact, criticizing outlets negative). NYT monolith, Apoorva Mandavilli doomsdayer whereas Leonhardt pretty positive since February so, cases started coming down. think need booster, internet sucks ever lately. sure worked store Oregon.

I mean, agree everything time. dismissed mocked going grain. help they've lied misled people number occasions last year so.

I however belive, know, DK sequencing unique coverage thus better picture variants most, including UK. know absolutely every varieant present 100% PCR's sequenced ca 8% population tested per day. know excectly variants present spread. Around half case indian variant cases imported, makes sense restrict travel areas like UK variant blooming people vaccinated.

Good thing we’re discussing US. I’ve heard it’s really good!

This either lip service won’t enforced, end well. hope it’s former. know difficult many people understand logic. Disclaimer though, opinion it, understand line thinking trying think ways get around it.

Covid statistically much less deadly disease people 20-30 flu. cite long term effects want there's studies showing mild cases really risk long term effects, also things happen serious cases flu, again, deadly 20-30 year olds Covid.

So evidence 20-30 year olds Covid less dangerous flu, would get two Covid shots likely put ass day, even normally get flu shots?

If rationale Covid threat you, needs different incentive. Scaring average 20-30 year olds getting Covid vaccinated going work. know vaccines well 90% effective, likelihood strain could break vaccine evolves things open back virus spreads partly vaccinated partly unvaccinated area?

The CDC stopped recording breakthrough cases, work powers seem giving almost protections place. feel good current state things states sense things going go hell months fall. Huh? paid attention real world epi data UK/Israel CA (where 2/3 adults vaccinated)?  


That's also efficacy vaccine works, subreddit frustrating sometimes. vaccine example 90% effective mean 10% people still get it, means chance getting COVID compared non vaccinated person 90% lower.  


**One common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.**  
 
**What 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19.** COVID-19? Canadians broad trust public health systems, generally go way bankrupt patients. 

People convinced -- small cause -- entire system rigged might trusting said system. Even word COVID exhausts now. wish could get amnesia something completely forget lmao. already envision headlines 3 years still referencing it, depressing. Thousands cases covid hundreds deaths school shootings think meant. people didn’t get vaccinated also enormous idiots willing anything even negatively affects others. really surprising. Yes, kids fine. protect exposing disease vectors. oldest school age school done excellent job taking precautions minimizing risk. doesn’t mean I’m going put kids confined space (like plane) travel bunch anti maskers anti vaxxers.

\- 83% Americans  everyone feeling this, kind are. It'll take readjust. I'm ready jump right back life though. I’m deer scientist I’m saying people vaccinated, hardly died I'm medical science know bit managing decisions around uncertainty one biggest complaints establishment science completely failed communication this. (And even getting government issues like head CDC saying send vaccinated kid camp danger next day saying masks unnecessary vaccinated people)

First: Science actually say anything do. inform relative risks. risks infinite, still shocked number twenty somethings say ""I want get covid die"" say ""follow science"". lethal younger people. Note that's ""never lethal"" leads nicely next point.

Second: tradeoffs everything. make hard decisions could decide get rid disease first place would grand. accept risks every day get car bat eye it. I'm saying acceptable level since driving probably riskiest thing people do, understanding zero covid may desirable, infinite cost. harsh assessment point sacrificing future youngest generation worth saving oldest. Obviously there's balance that's sort ad absurdum argument, think communication good steep age curve disease is.

Third: Nobody seems willing give uncertain answers. we've dealing awhile knowledge idea ""knowing something"" means become issue itself. There's tendency X proven study therefore must opposite X that's things work. good example transmission among vaccinated people. obviously going take time prove vaccinated people transmit disease, seems like careful, also assume like every disease proven otherwise rather think must one disease transmit asymptomatically vaccinated.

I've learned science governments around world massive communication problem this. I'm guessing seeing FIL die made brother realize serious. Yooo pike county gang. Grew lol Could? No, absolutely guaranteed increases risk spreading Covid. intended decrease risk, intended say risk low enough vaccinated people. 

Staying home seeing friends also risk, people wrong that, wrong order magnitude problem. risk low enough vaccinated people start things friends again, even indoors. low pre-vaccine.

That’s reply! insight people feeling vaccine resolving symptoms, placebo? something biological taking place, hypothetically? problem spreading can't get vaccine medical age (sub-12yo) reasons. extreme cases yes. haven’t heard stories people getting fines couple people over. must misconception immunosuppressed people. Many us chronic illnesses huge risk early death pandemic. severe risk hospitalized get COVID everything opening apparently non-symptomatic fully vaccinated persons spread COVID us unlike rest vaccinated population. “hold hostage” case. Teachers unprecedented number public health issues walk doors (Covid, school shootings) government done literally bare minimum ensure teacher safety workplace. Teachers many customers (administrators, parents, students) whose wants don’t always align teachers need. Good strong unions. Thanks. Btw know what’s expected time get second Pfizer dose? know governments changing things up, what’s minimum maximum time expect second dose? I’m never gonna unsubscribe I’m excited day daily discussion threads either cease exist almost comments don’t feel compelled check latest vaccine rate restrictions. guess point summer become something check weekly rather daily Cable news absolutely headlines. Meanwhile, society moving on. decide want keep panicking headlines accept thing lead normal life. People vaccine still get / carry / transmit Covid. love top comment. I’m still laughing don’t know why. Noticed flair says Virology/Microbiology :P. disagreeing message ""I'm scientist"" part.  got infected, get vaccinated? [Here's means protected infection disease get one new variants. also protected SARS-CoV-1 (See below)

Can people fully vaccinated still spread virus people vaccinated? [Probably [really [keeps getting less (thanks /u/poop_scallions, PDF) 

Not yet vaccinated? [Watch maybe [a look Recent [TWiV Clinical Update recent [Vincent Racaniello

[Old Comment - Vaccines variants issue.

[Old Comment - Additional stuff, thoughts.

If food bought last year Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., time eat donate food pantry. expired, eat toss instead donating please. want prepared future emergencies, go ahead buy replace it, guess.

If American waiting turn get vaccinated, turn.

If vaccinated, turn help people get vaccinated. 

If strategy get older Americans vaccinated, please spread word. 

I think need get point get hospitals back normal operation get family doctors/GP's doses give like flu vaccine. like tons extra doses. Novavax help here.

The vaccines FREE US. FREE FREE, like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. Go get one. Now. something stopping going get one today? Talk it, we'll get worked out.

Mixing Vaccines: intervals might increase efficacy extended past 3 4 CDC says 42 days doses (but may extended point).

Okay, good news:

The J&amp;J ""Pause"" shows [the CDC good watchdog vaccines.

**More variant stuff:**

There [might much room left SARS-CoV-2 into.

CDC [doesn't we'll need boosters/updates/etc mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work [Double/Triple/Indian (and Moderna, probably) [works B.1.1.7 B.1.351 Every time neutralization assay variant vs Pfizer/Moderna, get result. [The vaccine really important. Probably [more important vaccine better disease:**

[Penis issues (but [not Covid Infection (but vaccine).

[Loss way [more think. occur vaccines.

[Fewer symptoms = less Vaccines make fewer symptoms (*if* get infection vaccination).

From new recommendations Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings significant factors: vaccinated people become infected virus, transmission seems rarer still; vaccines appear effective known variants coronavirus. 

Remember, got infected, recovered, got least one dose Pfizer, immunity multiple variants, also SARS-CoV-1, virus named SARS 2003. Turns much [the ""breadth"" immunity thinking:

US : 

Children seem spread virus effectively adults. 

We okay vaccination numbers lots natural immunity.

Adults spread virus much effectively children. that's good news. half people 11 vaccinated, many natural immunity. 

So yes, children vulnerable infection, tend superspreaders. people going get infected cause spread already done so, vaccinated. Now, still tons people could infected left. So, need help math :

What additional value vaccinating one additional older person vs younger person? vaccinate young person, protecting person. vaccinate old person, probably preventing spread. Indian variants: ""I'm ruin man's whole career..."" access data prevalence allergic reactions covid vaccines prior history allergic reactions vaccines? data seen looks rates general population rather prior history reactions. WHOOOOLE NEEEW WOOOORLD [We're 38% population first shot right now, government long time 80%.

I think confusing part we're talking % vaccinated we're often speaking three different metrics: % total pop one shot, % total pop two shots, % ""eligible"" pop one shot.

TBH think % eligible pop one shot important metric right now. Yeah, same. really think done point (unless able vaccinate almost everyone essentially eradicate COVID, doubt) “We considering vaccine passport,” specified. However, state recommending, requiring, mega-outdoor event venues 10,000 attendees verify patrons vaccinated provide negative tests. Non-vaccinated participants need wear mask. indoor venues 5,000 people, recommendation verify vaccination negative COVID tests effect. Sounds like visit home, face obstacles coming back US afterwards. saying that’s problem, headline (as usual) could clear. Oof. would actually work too. already know influenza risk upcoming season drastically reduced decreased ""seed"" cases summer.

How one balance that? irrelevant? know man. continued butchering everyone's life save tonnes people age 82. point I'm falling closer Boris one accept high fatality rate another 250-300k deaths total 500k 60 million people.  Would great wait vaccine approval younger kids. Production capabilities availability. Especially demand PPE would impossible fulfill without China. Hello neighbor. I’d say people wear mask, amount unmasked people noticeably increased area. Ok symptoms minor ill take chances. Intention taking place. socially distance mask. used leverage anti vax bullshit. goes science people support ignorant antivaxxers anti maskers. Sweet, thanks.   propaganda, great fear mongering. release report early literally basis considered fact fact rouse people. common sense sure, nothing besides fan flame two sides yelling. report news, things might news. spread incomplete information people consuming fact literally entire reason quarrel begin with. one knows what's correct ""news"" outlets want fear monger. say masks? said we're going masks distancing, can't provide accommodations put back individual.

Immunocompromised people many cases unable protect vaccine. Offering ways safer, ""wear n95 cubicle 8 hours day go eat car"", make things better. Lol people think 2 options capitalism socialism Can’t blame people wanting risk blood clots there’s safer alternative available. Yeah agree would nice require proof. know many places intending that, whether logistics thing liability thing. 

By order governor florida, illegal around parts. 1 14 way higher 1% what's Japan? comment thread (and I've heard elsewhere), seems like country overwhelmingly conservative... yet brief flashes innovation (automotive industry, things mentioned). latter anomalies, allowed happen?

One guy stagnated wages rose manufacturing went shore. cool little robots processes designed 80s 90s.

Is something that? explain point? I’ve got vocal liberal in-law still won’t even leave house 10yo kid vaccinated. Frankly point think sees way brag wealth social media often follows “we’re able afford groceries everything else delivered long takes.”

I really can’t comprehend brain works.  bleeds.... leaves Hawaii?  embarrassing. example gave infections among 1000 people exactly right. don’t understand simple concept shouldn’t speaking something ignorant about. study linked even confirms this. Also, trialsdo indicate 95% lower chance getting covid exposed. read that. challenge trials yet. moderna pfizer vaccines looked symptomatic infection. jansen vaccine took account hospitalizations. 
The last point made could used every scenario life.  includes kids, people certain cancers, immune disorders among unwilling though possibility sued hospital medical bill, means wages garnished even liens placed people's homes.

Covid might kill them, ensuing poverty will. ...arent white americans race highest vaccination %???? Oh didn’t think outdoors. don’t remember guidance maybe they’re fine. sure applies concessions/bathrooms. misspelled acronym.  Interesting, thanks! hope everything go well! would want take vaccine amping immune response. need carefully timed body builds memory home.

That one rubbed wrong start. wanted keep going bars restaurants, job can’t done home, want food keep showing grocery store, lot people like keep showing grow it, cook it, safety test it, package it, ship it. mention DoorDash driver bringing door, grocery employees, etc. 

For us never option, go world every day anyway, “your vaccine protect you,” *the fucking best news,* I’m sorry I’m thrilled it. Yay! Time stop panicscrolling r/Coronavirus! Oh boy. You’re one those…… change me. bed 8 8.30 pm, sometime 3 6 am. 20 min power nap lunch. ok. I'm sure scientists actually developed vaccines got super rich too.... right?   making vaccinated people wear masks adds absolutely zero value. taking ""small steps make society better"", literally inconveniencing people part help battle COVID-19 people shitty.

Expecting people hold personal accountability point standard, hiding behind stuff like ""it's kind do"" ridiculous. adds value. did, would different. Doesn’t matter. 50% low virologist many others I’ve seen.  don’t SARS-COV-2 hasn’t around long enough tell sure. seeing immunity functioning similar SARS-COV-1 notated thread shown robust cell response recovered people day. Sure, leave natural selection, people helping virus mutate different kind may start whole pandemic again. ""pApErS pLeAsE"" like shut hell show damn vaccine card. hard. 

Cue people lying throwing fit ""I left card home"" line work security. Ok page there. see referring article. 

They going able enforce rule first second all, matter unvaccinated people really spread unvaccinated people freedom choice thing, third relevant Yankee stadium outdoors, odds spreading disease negligible, even one unvaxxed anti masker happened get through, symptomatic fever, coughing, risk still extremely low. believe even CDC recognizes basically risk outdoor settings. fact health officials saying since last years BLM protests. Finger lifted NJ either, pretty draconian. make people weary getting vaccine. Imo, want increase vaccinations opening respectful dialogue, answer basic questions instead treating people care put body like bunch idiots. Stop generalizing assuming people want info care spreading stopping disease.

There's simply lack respect, honesty transparency throughout entire process. want force people get on-top that? right approach. would love see research done Toxoplasmose prevalence country overall reactions measure proposed. know France Brazil high Toxoplasmose prevalence. ( 50%) one side effect take risk less open changes. theory works right factor people AIDS. 

The virus keeps mutating people compromised immune systems.

Where people getting vaccines? Africa 

Where lot population infected AIDS ? Africa

Where people poor can’t always get needed medication? Africa

Where Chinese trading lot lot air traffic Wuhan ? Africa

Where never hear news ? Africa. Well, one hand concerned variants vaccinated. 


On hand, get fucking vaccinated. sure guy amused water purification. Clearly never tried water Flint, Michigan. India entered room anything anyone else?

Why stop call 911 see accident? get physically help them? hold door open someone behind you? stop someone crossing street? 

Because society better place realize people's struggles take small steps make easier. maybe could learned past year vulnerable plain old *nice* care protecting people. 

Maybe that. kind. 100% need go like this. remember well. US shut borders waaay late shutting flights China racist month. banned somehow assumed Europeans carry virus? 2 months lost shutting borders mention active pandemic get mountain data efficacy. /u/OldenWeddellSeal/ refer medical article first paragraph? severe cases causing antibodies mild causing less? known mild Covid causes wildly different antibody counts across varieties people. appear correlated symptom strength. 
 
I’m defining managing Covid symptoms without trouble meaning went lives mild symptoms mild discomfort recovered. Antibody decay normal. know long memory cells last. That's crucial mechanism spin antibodies ever exposed future. Well course, (typically) stupid. See part says vaccination rates aren’t 50% community.  exactly right think pushing policies. policies set hospitals handling cases. risk getting overwhelmed spikes due COVID-19, strict requirements. aren't, strict requirements. reached herd immunity basically impossible hospitals get overwhelmed, never talks restrictions again.

My guess we're somewhere around ""they're risk getting overwhelmed, possible cases explode"", we're getting closer closer ""impossible overwhelm hospitals"". Thought implicit comment chain *getting vaccinated* lol 'muh facts science' crowd trying explain meant politically convenient.

Comparing US key tenet Canadian identity. Well get non-peer reviewed information supports narrative. non-peer reviewed article sad something frighten scare sub, would even allowed posted. Shame perverting science favor. beautifully absurd reference, that's why! What’s stopping unvaccinated person taking mask inside establishment? someone going follow around establishment make sure keep on? long for?  No, time overtly cautious little data. know lot COVID19 May 2021 compared March 2020 decisions based that.

Under logic, kids get vaccine either, could hypothetically side effects road (there logic using).

This ""what long term issues never identified?"" literally anti-vaxxer logic. People Indiana? statewide mandate came early lifted relatively early. 

Cali never said ""Outside safe! Yay!""

Cali's position top heap media marklar means rest country either went along with, rebelled against, Cali. Lol, sucks them. correct. spell wrong Ignorance bliss. laugh expel millions times covid particles coughing death quietly home. big problem vaccine passports going get 50 states agree something. states want part vaccine passports. punished state run morons.

Maybe something could done federal level, course big problem states hold vaccine records. could totally see state (Missouri) giving giant middle finger CDC whatever federal agency would charge issuing vaccine passports.

In theory nice idea, see pull US. TIL 18-34 qualifies ""kids"". Well obviously, would start giving shit we’re rounding corner! far they’re concerned nothing changed lives all. watch it. want succeed something secede state? Wrong spelling = wrong meaning. We're 14 months in, looking close end point offering adults first vaccination. honestly baffles people consider putting things risk we're close. got image head electronic signs (In U.S. anyway) stores date representing latest DOBs allowed buy alcohol cigarettes transformed ""You must vaccinated date allowed establishment"". 

Wonder long need vaccine date DL?

Enforcement interesting. Anti-Maskers forced get vaccines visit stores? Heads explode. Half replies massively upvoted article sarcastic wanna-be John Stewarts (without intelligence) claiming obvious, half well written replies pointing flaws article title.

One teachable moments think.

Science matters politically convenient, claims importance simply people signal momentary convenience. supply chain person, wonder would possible proactively increase inventory production capacity raw materials last year, preparation vaccines. Yep. Plenty jobs require vaccines. wife required provide documentation she'd flu shot (working schools). shit legal weeeeeeeed people refuse vaccine lie taking it? That's them. made choice. accept consequences.

 

Agreed. fully. People dying Covid years probably due foolishness. stupid, like average swede since way.  hope get obviously asking for.

You rooting people become sick disease? Fuck yes. throw fit carded alcohol? show ID, proof insurance registration pulled police? see reason card prove vaccination card yours. already corrected statement kids, add that.

Instead, I'll respond vaxed safe care?

Familial love annoying tendency unreserved unconditional. love care people even wrong, misinformed uneducated. Shit, entirely seperated family still love them.

Not say never lose connection, can, make statement naive. can't get medical age-related reasons still wearing masks, like everyone else unvaccinated per guidelines. Everyone knows risks point; comply, that's (or case children, parents).  Freedom fucking stupid. realize applies businesses, parks? 

You think every small business Oregon afford fucking armed security, let alone nightmarishly Orwellian is? 

You literally insane. Ofcourse mofos don’t care spreading cooties I’m referring easy catch virus. don’t know specifics could get away keeping six feet away people flu Covid would n95s avoid crowded indoor spaces altogether. peer reviewed people crying nothing here. Logically openings killed people. 600? 800? matter? use logical common sense know it’s less 100.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically.

Working retail, dangerous wear one cloth mask? ran R-95 masks use, know still risk catching virus.  
How relaxed work wearing mask taking mask getting something drink taking break? 

I got Moderna shot Owens/Krogers, matters all. put simply, yes. There's exemptions travel ban, visa types given blanket National Interest Exemptions lawsuits, generally non-immigrants subject travel bans. 

The way get around travel ban personally apply National Interest Exemption local embassy, travel country subject travel ban, stay 14 days, enter US there. Unfortunately people non-immigrant visas ability take much time off, pretty prohibitive leaving country. understand instituted closures, going fact missing intel. chances contracting covid beach like .01%. gamble, Florida took gamble kept beaches open statistical uptick FL keeping beaches open vs. CA shutting down. uptick cases spring break Florida could traced large part gatherings surrounding bars restaurants chose stay open. CA shutting beaches probably benefit, acknowledging mean CA completely inept covid response means. got second dose 4 weeks ago girlfriend 6 weeks ago. We're hesitantly ready No, arguments used ""because people going listen mask mandate, can't remove mandate anyone"". That's ridiculous argument referring to, punishing people following laws regulations people listen regulations.

In theory, vaccine passport right move. difficult enforce, best option there. Blocked paywall. Anyone Cliff notes version? people missing. 40-60% lower chance tested positive, already unlikely.

If people around vaccinated, that's even unlikely. unvaccinated passing unvaccinated people getting ill.

Its fact people get ill, chance virus mutate mutates, chance mutation stopped vaccines, deadly infectious produced.

You KNOW mutates, viruses do. must seen concerns Indian variant example.

What definitely want new NY variant kills one 10 unaffected vaccines.

THAT'S people need get vaccinated wear masks socially distance do. worry enough dinks keep virus mutating finds form screws vaxed folks too. :(  Dunning Kruger Double/triple layer condoms?

Isn't actually something makes less effective? Reddit fucking moment, holy shit mean sociopaths haven’t taken pandemic seriously reservations traveling don’t want vaccinated virus don’t take seriously? BD name manufacturer type syringe? groups unwilling, they're unable. immunocompromised unable, generate robust immune response. still get vaccine though regardless continue protect way Covid came along. Sure Jan."
