However, biggest fucking fan vaccine anyway, tell friends get even can't meeting vaccinated protects can't be. far infuriating thing I've seen parents get told (and someone whose kid health issues make bit risk) long family vaccinated, care anyone else is? Ignoring underlying bad premise, also skipped right past ""my child can't get vaccinated yet risk"" thing. absolutely right. People children can't vaccinated allowed live lives.

Damn, Russians really trying hard spread anti-vax propaganda Despite fact he’s convinced supporters take it, fact Trump locked Moderna Pfizer vaccines USA arguably best (only) good thing President. receive vaccine think something start thinking about, think it’s unnecessary.

-Donald Trump don’t think it’s misleading live LA. know LA County hospitals means hospitals run county. NYC knows hospitals run NYC Health Hospitals run city.  They're mostly low income/Medi-Cal patients, yeah. still large contingent conservatives refusing get vaccinated though. Thanks! Oz quarter half vaccinated ten percent fully vaccinated. banked completely AZ bought lot Pfizer, won’t really start come next month won’t really pick October.

It’s ideal situation still better third world countries won’t get fully vaccinated end 2022.  One look data two tables combined one:

The data COVID pretty damn bad. I’ll continue avoid family getting it. 

It felt moment like trying increase understanding concerns appears simply want find something argue about. I’m looking argue. What?  Oh see mean now, bad. think 2nd doses prioritised extra room first doses, next wave coming ready hits month 2. government proactive I'm going complain that, many people think vaccine ""can wait"". ...What blanket statement read 🤦🏾‍♂️ information regards spread one vaccinated individual another? imagine quite rare, even covid19positive board seen explicit instances this. I'm curious I've hanging around vaccinated friends morning woke feeling little bit unwell.  


Thanks. county hospitals people less likely vaccinated would go, it’s anything like NYC. Sir literally (talking about) Wendy's ObEsE also 95  go getting something insurance would pay towards you’re us? soon get 3rd booster shot safe? Yep Canada also takes forever get help many people take seriously, trying get help daughter emotional breakdown pandemic difficult took several weeks (this ""priority"" level too). hotlines either busy operating hours.. actual youth emergency clinic taking walk ins required appointments. Luckily help alone trying get help I'm sure could done go emergency deal well mental health  Mk, well it’s hard see could covid vaccine data that’s older December 2019. data going back date indeed liar. Australia 27 % first doses already. 2 1/2 months behinde european union. 

Oceania 3 months behinde EU. operation warp speed Biden thing? Yep live. People hide looks either, flat give death stare. would consider another option becomes available, mRNA stem cell vax him.

Good news then! take literally [Possibly unreliable site, probably site would trust]

And know would anti-mRNA (there lots bs reasons going around), fortunately Google find excuse bullshit, especially ""fetal cell"" nonsense. Well probably is. seeing real life efficacy. Right longer original variant we're facing. Sinovac ?

Radio silence. updates whatsoever. supposed trust thing ? ""Not lot hospitalizations""

Honestly, that's important part. Getting covid sucks vaccinated. keeps hospital recover quickly win. ""Having young unvaccinated kid stressful right now.""

I totally understand this. oldest son 10 young get vaccine. also 2 half month old. 
I really wish people would think younger generation more. Kids may died virus certainly get it. pleasent sick it. worries send oldest back school new variants. Wow crazy. Maybe guys get covid test make sure day two. domestic flight? like offended wearing it. Like ""Didn't get memo? CDC says get rid masks!"" Kinda like high school peer pressure. Yea states massive failure vaccine uptake. many idiots. article makes nervous wedding Oct., already pushed back. guests come vaccinated, are, there's that!  Oh gotcha. confusing different story.   😉 What? didn't. slight correction, 4 DHS hospitals. spread enough mutate lethal vaccine resistant variant. It’s matter time honest. cruise companies want deal liabilities someone inevitably gets covid ship shut amenities / events quarantine. would unsurprisingly financially devestating cruise line. DeSantis laws matter grabbing attention hopes 2024 run, cruise industry literally billions dollars stake. That's literally kind self centered asshole DeSantis conservatives stupid ( rich know voting ). difficult deduce. Yep always someone else's fault. party personal responsibility anything but. don’t culture viruses, require live cells. Ahhh honestly days oxy way less people dying though…. Oh high actually worth it. Obviously ruin life That's correct, LACDHS four hospitals. patients admitted many private hospitals included statement.  FDA end all, multiple countries world wide fully approved it. Pull stupid head ass. safe vaccine. ChInAs fAuLt.

Well not? CCP contained epidemic first started, instead trying sweep rug, shitstorm may prevented. Yeah, Disney isn’t rural Mississippi.  Making cruise lines spread Covid far wide early 2020 responsible corporate citizens 2021. That's quite achievement, Florida! I’m stats teacher, genuinely appreciate correction! Exactly - ventilation much recirculated types ships. military personnel almost always depressed immune systems constant stress lack sleep - common see cold illness circulate among crew quickly. worst case scenario, given that, vaccine seems working pretty well.  suggest maybe legit medical studies performed rather using people countries lab rats, delusional clowns actually gnash teeth screech refusal accept dodgy survey several dodgy biased ""studies"" total participation around 2k literally killing millions global poor think evident that. Yes, people vaccinated getting sick, easily could contact unvaccinated person generally going far contagious. still theoretically possible hit herd immunity, though admit, Delta makes harder requires much higher percentage due higher R value.

This seem proof going continue survive spread even vaccination, truly unfortunate. better hope vaccines prevent whatever causes Long Covid, we're going see become ever increasing problem. Exactly. suspect may also dual infections usual colds cruds happen military ships normally simply close quarters constant stress (which hinders immune system). They've tested positive COVID, symptoms could several sources, especially Delta variant showing head cold symptoms. ""worst case scenario"" conditions, sounds like managed well expected. percentage irrelevant though. 

For UK people looking data saying ""Cases 1000% hospitalizations moved"" 

People legitimately saying, promoted government, ""An increase cases matter. increase hospitalizations deaths matters."" 

And normally obvious retort would ""Well obviously cases double double hospitalizations double. They're inseparable issues."" data portraying that, people's mentality shifted lot. Corrected wording, thanks! thought funny mission accomplished really. Subtle humor tough text. would gone something like misedumacation, nonsense word, make joke work. that? People going weddings since last May. vaccinated fine.  Something consider that, depending operating status ship, crew probably operating lot physical mental stress comes territory active duty military - stress weakens immune system.  

You're standing watch, getting 8 hours sleep, eating less optimal food (especially enlisted), living quarters college dorm levels cleanliness simply due numbers. recirculated ventilation tend ships possibly concentrating airborne viral levels, that's recipe worst-case scenario. added none crew seriously affected virus situation managed.

Sounds like positive COVID tests, serious symptoms. also suspect that, normal ships, especially big ones, may dual-infections usual colds cruds circulate shipboard. 

So even worst-case scenario, breakthrough cases testing positive COVID, mild symptoms, level needing hospitalization. I'd say speaks volumes importance efficacy vaccines, even worst case scenario. Even do, one believe data would authentic.  Ccp lost credibility Apparently theory still debated quite bit virologists, many think take likely case. Schools open August many areas.  time [the deaths remain low comparing US EU [vaccination rate high going Reminder everyone: vaccinated, safe. Delta Variant concern you. Repeat: concern you.

Only unvaccinated worry. Vaccinated ones not. Trying tell combat media stories Gottlieb's prediction Delta Variant. starters, common belief we'd get point herd immunity disease would stop spreading due near universal resistance it.

It's evident that's going happen. There's way many cases double vaxxed people ending hospital case. lot people asking UK uses AZ? unfortunately no. We're seeing double vaxxed Pfizer patients hospital too. data Australia pretty impossible get correct, Australia eliminated virus state new outbreak treated separate instance, especially since restrictions vary significantly state, also cases separated hotel quarantine, isolation, spreading virus; it’s complicated for

The [Australian sub much better analysis R0, estimates aboit 1.3 Sydney Canadian anti vaxxers... Take off, eh? Covid: *is serious illness high potential life-threatening complications*

The government: uh oh, better give hospitals money per patient treatment

Wackos: OMG, CONSPIRACY! RARGAFARGAGAYFROGS that's even close. Israel's data June (during Delta grew 90% end month) found full vaccination 64% symptomatic disease 93% hospitalization. Currently, last Friday, 55% adult infections happening fully vaccinated people.  thought [this one](http://wondermark.com/1k62/) agree you, seeing hospitalizations rising 0 20% cases rising 50 70% 

It due lag period, actually due case numbers rising much quickly young healthy people vulnerable groups 

The majority hospital admissions oldest age group, despite lowest rate infection, rate rising. 

That phenomena people saying there's link cases hospitalization anymore, think.  
Hopefully people realize again, doubling cases means doubling hospitalizations. Agreed. also ideal conversation honest. IE truthful extent. given political nature days relent. would hard get going forward cant work individuals beholden certain aspects constitution ignore/weaken/spit areas. Actually, not. understand numbers mean. 

Let's say looking vaccine 95% efficacy rate, 100 people vaccinated. efficacy rate mean 5 going get sick group exposed disease.

It means get 95% LESS infections would see unvaccinated. Even COVID near 100% transmission rate, seeing far, far less 3% rate infection scenario. get tested.  claim made time. saw similar comments morning sub. totally fine.

That said, got vaccine discussing “hesitants” would routinely say I’d rather die vaccine live another year like done. still feel way.

But wont, it’s extremely safe effective. one moving goalposts.  suggestion COVID came lab, even accident, considered conspiracy theory long ago.  link another comment responding showing proof that. 

This lazy revisionism happened mass surveillance programs US revealed world. Snowden, considered crazy suggested US government watching everything came actually true people started pretending knew along.  Yup. “trust science” crowd assumes they’re immune political tribalism, lo behold. Oh. would make sense. language unclear that.

 makes even worrisome though. COVID causing outbreak population 100% vaccination, well past herd immunity threshhold, infecting 5% people assume best case numbers, 14% worst. 

That's lot worse projections breakthrough infections I've seen. article claims masks social distancing still implemented. Yeah statement sounds like vaccines they're supposed to. headline sounds scary. Yes I've read that, you? Here's paragraph that's relevant previous comment:

In 1969, Supreme Court's decision Brandenburg v. Ohio effectively overturned Schenck authority case still carried. There, Court held inflammatory speech--and even speech advocating violence members Ku Klux Klan--is protected First Amendment, unless speech ""is directed inciting producing imminent lawless action likely incite produce action"" (emphasis mine).

It clarification wrote ""shouting fire \*with intent harm\*"" rather ""fire"" alive then. given nature post see discussing would lead anywhere.  get point. Maybe better live realtively strong wave re-opening re-open fully calm situation thinking everything's cool panic next wave (case Israel). 

In country (Poland) crazy wave early spring peak 900 patients hospitals per million compared 600 patients per million UK Italy worst moment. Maybe kind better natural immunity. may also younger people fully vaccinated uptake big among elderly. Cases Netherlands Spain skyrocketed days opened nightclubs. open close three weeks cases still low.

I hope Delta last big wave. Almost everyone kind contact virus either vaccinations infection soon. contagious viruses we're going see lot breakthrough cases anyway, organisms better equipped fight disease time. stupidity thread astounding. Highly unlikely. incubation period thought 4 days delta. would imagine less 24 hours virtually unheard of. covid, almost certainly didn’t get her. could also thousand things make feel crappy. wish could done US TBH (exceptions made kids) ship sailed US. Unless vaxxed people start getting sick en masse would incredible uphill battle. First time seeing it?  agree dangerous doing. even agree illegal spread certain types misinformation. balance though power government use new powers unintended ways. Sure, we’d like pretend that. see things control. People choosing get vaccinated, boosters already trials folks might need six month boost (over 65, autoimmune, etc.) Vaccines loosing efficacy 6 mos. year normal, science pretty ready! gotta get poked again.  Lol bullshit. I’m knocking opinion didn’t exist even expressing lab born origin got painted broad brush recently. article explains rationale might be. 100% yes vaccinated person want information. longer testing vaccinated travel, workplaces, prisons, homeless shelters, even confirmed exposure someone covid.  
 
All right website   
 
Other countries still testing vaccinated numbers look significantly different Delta. think correct, place good ideas moving forward. think key ""free speech"" allows lot things personally like, ""speech causes mass death extends pandemic"" siloed ways, mechanism it, legally. Actually, bad breakthrough infections. 

For starters, common belief we'd get point herd immunity disease would stop spreading due near universal resistance it. shows COVID still cause outbreak environment 100% vaccinated, good.

You're also misunderstanding estimated efficacy numbers. Let's say looking vaccine 95% efficacy rate, 100 people vaccinated. efficacy rate mean 5 going get sick group exposed disease.

It means get 95% LESS infections would see unvaccinated. Even COVID near 100% transmission rate, seeing far, far less 3% rate infection scenario. would floored things ever look remotely like last fall winter. sane person would think asshole concerned going. That's largely Trump suggested media say something negative it. ok discuss it. Tribalism impacting nearly everything now.  wordplay uneducation / joke, guess ESL speaker go territory. jokes come across, humour difficult thing foreign languages. Fauci: *corvette* *corvette*

*covid* *covid*  Thank fucking God. COVID January 2021 vaccinated March. worried protection going wane. We’re talking vaccination policies here, nothings else early one 2009, studies turned similar results; inverse relationship USA update first dose shots:

70% 8/8 it. hate weddings would anything get 90% sounds like great reason go me.

But something wanted do, would go little worry it. neat! 1700 crew. outbreak started. likely many cases. crew several months sea. question every crew member gets infected. Agreed constantly spraying sanitizer repeatedly cleaning surfaces. Also plexiglass barriers. ""If sure, sharing often prudent thing do.""

Sorry. didn’t realize ask permission allowed speak. Talk friends family, surgeon general suggests

Oh no. really clueless. idea bad. think intent pretty clear level media figures Tucker Carlson, et al. people demonstrably well informed, take appropriate precautions health safety, knowingly broadcast misinformation viewers.

Other public figures, Mike Lindell similar agitators, also informed enough culpable, opinion. lawyer make claims be, aware first amendment protections people hide behind protect consequences actions. know work around it, think causing unacceptable amounts death suffering held accountable. actually better stated efficacy rate. better question severe symptoms are.  No. incorrect. 3700 entire fleet 6 vessels. Queen Elizabeth 700 1700. cannot find source exact number.  upsetting people understand want vaccination anywhere near children old enough make decision sufficient time determine long term side effects??  

Demanding vaccination everyone bad fully anti Vax trying stop people getting vaccination. hypocritical. percentage increase irrelevant regard. Many people still fully vaccinated. Whether they're anti-vaxx, lazy, young first. (reduced) percentage still get hospitalised even doses. 

What matters ratio hospitalisation cases. number cases we're seeing, hospitalisations low. Thank much post!!!!!!!! said increase cases leading increase hospitalizations UK. 

I gave evidence shows false. pretending like count? 

Listen, clear going change mind evidence contrary believe rather, dig harder evidence you. think time end conversation. Goodbye nice day. 100/3700=2.7% crew, none serious symptoms. situation warrants close watching, 3% ship's crew getting infected serious symptoms much less alarming headline. come conservative downvote drones. Jeez even said /s? 100 updootz? UK fucked everyone else.

Given pattern rises falls accross various regions UK decent idea plays good news need restrictions imposed.  say “hopefully”  could due shared ventilation extremely high viral loads (exposure multiple sick long periods time). Diamond Princess taught us anything infection continue last sick person removed masks airborne transmission

You know novel means right? March/April 2020 world turned attention virus existed approximately 6 months point. way instantly find stuff know find stuff adjusted guidelines accordingly. data vaccines shows infection mild enough transmission reduced enough got doses waited two weeks second dose mask serves purpose them. say thing 600K people killed.

That was't CDC, certain someone who's job 6 months coerced karens, rubes, idiots thinking constitution trampled enabled childish behavior. person also held rallies attendance thousands months vaccine even approved turned blind eye Texas Florida absolutely nothing. person who's name triggers post removal bot that, CDC.

UK person here... way pay health care US, chance unvaxxed go hospital probably avoid bill hope ""ride out"" home?

It seems decent amount vaccinated people hospitalised UK though usually milder far less fully vaccinated. though, people could go minor symptoms avoid financial burden.  true. People like bottom list. 66%+ growth per week area SC 40% population vaccinated number skewed older higher rates large counties like Charleston.

A lot people really bad time. yup. 40 co-morbidities. Tested positive January 2021. Lost smell 5 days symptom. cough random episodes fatigue next several months. long distance cyclist, fought tough. Got vaccinated J&amp;J May cough fatigue went away within week. saw signs going get better. crediting vaccine whether scientific basis not. sick hearing takes hospitalizations take seriously. empathy left people. Huh? told myth, still repeating it? cops going gives shit random person stepping Thai coin stop rolling away unless intentionally. still shitty way insult monarch. 

I mean, recently, activists burning large portraits King protest. No, efficacy supposed measure effect vaccine. 10 per 1000 unvaccinated seniors hospitalized 1 per 1000 vaccinated ones did, vaccine showed 90% effectiveness hospitalizations seniors. 3 per 1000 unvaccinated young people hospitalized 1 per 1000 vaccinated ones were, 67% effective hospitalization young people. 

It's really important try compare effectiveness numbers exactly studied - exact vaccine gives different results measuring symptomatic cases testing people regularly see they're asymptomatic, effectiveness 2 weeks second dose right away starting first, etc. according morning's news, live Tennessee, they're doomed. downvoted? seem like stretch port New Orleans, I’m sure. kidding think CPS anything get called. given father mother literally overdosed. That's much took.  CDC says vaccinated people don’t need wear masks avoid indoor crowds; don’t trust science? yess, let's hope everything way better august He's talking percentage adults, percentage total population. people even know Pfizer American company. 

It likely plain ignorance. pandemic almost one knew biotech pharma names. Deep State thing /s easy way help themselves. Let's get kids 11 vaccinated really stop caring. ...

Neither country actually defined parameters goals - thresholds consider ""high [enough] vaccination rates"" borders ever reopen. Since current ruling parties made great political capital back much-trumpeted ""zero covid"" strategy, I'm convinced incumbents political back track admit reality here.

If 80yo’s risk death vaccination 15%, 20yo’s 0.2% (numbers approximately fudged vaccines reduce ~90% (conservatively), 80yo’s risk becomes 1.5%.

Even 20yo stays unvaccinated, 80yo’s 1.5% risk still considerably bigger 0.2%.

5 people group get hospitalized, 2 die.

You're looking saying, 'see? vaccine work! 2 people died group!' ignoring 85/90 people vaccinated group fine, 5/10 people unvaxxed group fine. much much better chance fine dying vaccinated.

And analogy still ignores fact vaccinated group random selection! fact contains self selected group likely get sick die, lung issues cancer. vape, says, family believes may damaged lungs made harder fight coronavirus.

I never seen media, western otherwise, say Chinese vaccines work. tell us Chinese vaccine less good stopping infection mrna vaccines - objectively true - countries saw breakthrough infections even serious illness(and death? Can't recall) vaccinated chinese vaccines.

Now, expected normal, old-school vaccine, western mrna vaccines also that, really quite extraordinarily well, much seems.

If feel people drawing unfair conclusions that, bummer. Maybe need reflect people would negative outlook China take information. was, clearly working NNN crowd.

It makes sense. Public health officials speak ""ideal"" conditions would be. health standpoint, would probably *ideal* people wore masks socially distanced *indefinitely*—just like would also ideal people *never* ate processed food, drank alcohol, ate meat way well done. live ""ideal"" world, though.

We've reached point–at least United States–where nearly anyone everyone who'd severely affected disease get vaccine. miracle modern medicine, we've greatly reduced risk COVID. Yes, people can't get vaccine. Yes, cases slip through. *never* reach *ideal* scenario, though.

It's fine experts make recommendations, reality life short. hunkering last 15 months expect make average life expectancy United States, spent 1-2% total life living this.

I'm worried others dismiss simply ""being stressed = changes period"". hope researchers also time look seriously.


Hopefully, there's really long term impact. Kinda scary think. *want* believe you’re sarcastic badly 18 months nut jobs can’t anymore. article mentions ""no diabetes, hypertension,"" unless *very* late April would surprised would eligible time 24 year old. preexisting health problem, sure, maybe, random healthy 24 year old. mom 70s able get first shot early mid March. truly greater good then? don’t know anymore. excess deaths areas kids probably developing extreme mental health issues lockdown doesn’t seem great me.

Except Hawaii Alaska, suppose. solution. may like it, is. vaccinated either? I'm expressing doubts anecdotal evidence whole pointing opposite anecdotal evidence proof useless. 

Stick statistics hard numbers   say normal life mandatory indoor masking? COVID dangerous (even vaccination) can't allow indoor dining, can't eat mask. also can't allow bars open since can't drink mask. also can't allow major event sporting matches music festivals. normal? Vancouver, Canada's fentanyl deaths hit 1716 last year.  started giving free prescribed drugs. need way still clinging beliefs. point don’t care long get shots. long Australia expect keep for? What's exit plan?  listen doctor. There's reason studies set 3-4 weeks doses data coming indicates even longer better. 5 days since first dose body anywhere near finishing reacting one, getting booster 3 days would largely pointless. Australia doesn’t know lockdown actually is. attitude, sanity mostly! stay safe too. thanks chat. :) would point Indonesia get Pfizer shipments 1st place that's saying.

Might well order all-sinovac. 60% stuff ... said Yep, always get medical advice Youtube videos! /s gets disheartening point is. can't sway people, facts make dig deeper. Stay safe! Lol. ""You permitted illegally smoke cafe unless vaccinated.""  I'm surprisingly unsurprised worked anti-vaxxer/Conspiracy theorist Depends Australian not.

For international students I'd say university fees $AUD32k per year. 

Maybe $Aud230 per week accommodation. self cater.

For Australian students university fees less, accommodation costs same. 

For Australian students university course fees vary lot government subsidies less depending priority place field study. booked vaccine appointment! Jnj tomorrow! I’m ecstatic. side effects bad mRNA vaccines? hospitalized? ""working like should"" mean vaccines make deaths virtually non-existent (which Sinovac less successfully compared Pfizer / Moderna Indonesian healthcare workers' case).

What numbers Pfizer/Moderna inoculated Indonesian healthcare workers? latest data healthcare workers specify vaccinated/unvaccinated groups derive efficacy vs death. data May early June 26 dead - 10 vaccinated 16 unvaccinated 90% vaccination rate (i.e. 9x vaccinated unvaccinated lower deaths), gives Sinovac ~93% efficacy vs death, studies (Turkish, Chilean) kept efficacies vs death 80-100% range. get 60% restrict wishing vaccine whose efficacy highest ?

It help say vaccine ineffective (blatant misinformation) countries ""wait"" certain vaccine shortage them, yes. multiple cases people read stuff Internet wanted ""wait"" vaccine, ended dead hospital. [Example (first suggesting people wait Pfizer lead deaths collapse medical system e.g. Pfizer's first batch arrive August number doses per month 7.5-12 mil doses, enough fully cover 2% less population. Shut shops! browsing! click collect. That's r/im14andthisisdeep mean, define ""paid off""?

If mean ""making decision political monetary gains without regards people's safety middle global pandemic aggressively pushing vaccine whose trials even finished yet whose available data sketchy least, basically forcing people even vaccines better documentation andsafety measures *finished trials* already available, going far *spreading misinformation* vaccines crap Favored Vaccine unquestionably best - vaccine OK, all"", yes, suppose ""paid off"".

But change fact like Sinopharm, Orbán ignoring safety millions Hungarian citizens sake authoritarian corrupt goals, continues ignore *having opted EU initiative securing vaccines Pfizer*, order push Sputnik Sinopharm even more, also sake idiotic oh typical decision Hungary create vaccines - based outdated expensive method Sinopharm also uses. Amazing.

Get Sputnik, want it. may OK vaccine, fact Russia still able present necessary data EU authorities speaks volumes trustworthy companies behind are. Also, forget traveling anywhere within Europe... think it'd set bad precedent government mandated it, issues schools businesses requiring it. rule typically provide deny service whoever like. That's free market. colleges basically businesses US, I'd argue restricts that, makes hilarious conservatives since usually proponents maintaining free market. Masks ways one. would also intetesting compare people one ""bog-standard"" viral even bacterial illnesses floating around forever. 

I've definitely years never even sick enough go doctor still took months remotely back ""normal"" certain symptoms developed chronic issues. afraid vaccine please exercise freedom stay home Given vaccine doesn’t prevent spread, make much difference give first based criteria. virus reduce severity symptoms. way everyone vaccinated. source article posted comment poster. evidence..I actually read article.  virus originated thruthful things would've better.

You missing gist - done purpose, nature live tracking, bound errors. Almost every country, including China regularly revised numbers waves anything tbh clear way long talking Delta would add way credibility vaccine nothing more

The countries deploy Sinovac recently started getting Delta, think receive new data later summer. far majority Sinovac users South America battles Gamma Lambda strains instead. Lambda, actually. Unfortunately pair lungs could've gone someone else fuck over, like someone cystic fibrosis. honestly. mom really religious started getting conspiracies really straighten tell foolish being. took while, vaccinated fully now. can't even believe HEALTH professionals act way read story young nurse Florida died covid vaccines. even infected family dying. crazy me. find someone watching fox news unironically, really change way associate them. even mention covid steer convos away it. point people choose vaccinate non health/age reasons realize sitting ducks worst strain yet. goes everyone, next one reinfect even covid already (like delta) escape vaccine more, that's murder. someone believe pandemic real, said go watch stuff India (this delta hitting country really hard). said half fake half 'because poor' basically. fricking racist person talk anymore. sorry went OFF!!! feel though. sense jaded b.s. i'm sorry! worried side effects vaccine. researched side effects covid. needs double lung transplants now?

It’s playbook. It’s diabolical hey they’re trying disenfranchise millions people gerrymandering implementing modern day Jim Crow laws. 1/4 confirmed cases lot surely 1/4 20% show symptoms? easily force millions.

But gotta deal 10s hundreds millions. Hopefully billion... apparently 19000 protesters across country, that’s small protest France. parents get away it. repercussions unless DHS/CPS gets involved. kids left nuclear fallout trying navigate adulthood longterm mental/emotional/physical consequences parents actions.

From french newspapers highly accurate data reading comment sections articles newspapers different political sides, seems go smoothly.

Only far elft far right it, go outside anymore everybody wins. CDC = Google?  desperation attempt ensure maximum protection front line workers. studies mixing AZ Pfizer, J&amp;J booster shots Pfizer/Moderns, etc. fact enough data see whether mixing indeed improves efficacies not, recently deemed less safe, that's it. hundreds France, thousands max Paris. Really small protests french standards now.

keep mind physical limits infectious virus become climbing fitness peak like this. study side-effects San Marino study side-effects Argentine (not Sputnik V, Sinopharm AstraZeneca also) (in Spanish, machine translation seems work alright). know vaccines work. What's irresponsible sharing piece information DONT 100% prevent covid people hospitalized die. 

We KNOW vaccinated folks less likely die hospitalized. posted people think 100% immune covid vaccinated.

Also, read post detailed information. primarily average person infected much younger past \[due vaccines\]

Yeah, we've heard  Nov 22, 2020  fewer people dying COVID-19, even cases surge  demographic shift clear — 18-to-29-year-olds lately accounting largest share new cases across age groups. 60% lowball estimate delta 98% high estimate alpha. High estimate efficacy Delta still 70%

Also keep mind vaccines developed January 2020, fact they're still effective combatting infection year half later pretty impressive. There's reason get flu vaccine every year.

Also, even among breakthrough cases, asymptomatic mild. odds hospitalized breakthrough case still 90% lower unvaccinated.  wasn’t aware, thank info. vaccinate children safe?! became Win sitation trust scientists lost forever. irresponsible share information without sharing key fact, namely, 1,063 cases 17 deaths **out many vaccinated people?** exact thing instills doubt CDC/WHO. wrong wrong, give people hard time trusting advice. 99 percent hospitalized people die Covid unvaccinated. winter going hellscape delta variant raging throughout population. think law 1999 forced birthers fighting since then. little girl question 11 months old. (I clicked comment made curious, FYI) get want include statements made Eric Feigl-Ding part misinformation? Also idea masks better vaccines?  here! friends Vancouver I've wanting visit! “Just asking questions.” means likely get exposed COVID. vaccines good, unlikely get sick exposure. there's (for example) twice much COVID going around, still twice likely catch get sick it. Just, vaccinated, that's twice small chance. Right. Best explanation I've seen mRNA vaccines target spike protein virus uses attach cells replicate.  variants still spike protein future variants form well. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

There's chance since called out, eh. Lots posts sub zero mention politicians figures responsible spreading disinformation ""It's civil."" Well mean vaccine emergency use authorization meaning isn’t approved they’re exactly wrong. 

Per FDA:

Under section 564 Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), Secretary HHS declares emergency use authorization appropriate, **FDA may authorize unapproved medical products unapproved uses approved medical products used emergency** diagnose, treat, prevent serious life-threatening diseases conditions caused CBRN threat agents certain criteria met, including adequate, approved, available alternatives. WTF wrong southern states?to many kissin cousins?  I'm super tempted too, bit unsure might screw vaccination records somehow, wrong birthdate it... last info saw said 30%. could changed though info coming in.

Edit say goes exponentially second shot. built covid wards flammable materials. Would stories media vaccines “might effective variants”. ? might good 6 months? might become annual thing?

Or rare side effects causing pauses vaccine distribution cdc press releases?

Is misinformation discussing? Nobody guess situation Aug 2021 much less early 2022. could could new flavor worry about. mean, you’re truly breathing difficulties, calling 911 going hospital valid; vast majority people occupy hospital aren’t party think peak around July 19 least plateau around slew infections due Euro test positive around then. 19th schools close. Unlike doom mongers independent SAGE think ,this perhaps best time ease restrictions. summer less flu cases. getting vaccinated like premeditated drunk driving thing could mutate affect children vaccinated people. 

Let's forget probably billions people still even access vaccine. far risk variants go, yes antivaxxers problem virus care people vaccinated. still probably likely new variants show somewhere developing world. guess American/Canadian border never opening...  doesn’t prevent spread much don’t need lot seed cluster. Singapore documented cluster 29 vaccinated, 21 transmissions vaccinated vaccinated. 

Check many transmissions vaccinated, even vaccinated index case. prioritising young people mean asymptomatic carriers infect vulnerable. There’s way vaccinate everyone maintain boosters variants we’re back lockdowns depends long ""ride out"" home guess  Thanks. Basically. choice have? They’re holding us hostage winning unvaccinated people keep clogging system ultimately prevent vaccinated individuals receiving quality care ICUs… taking resources people willfully ignorant help themselves. 30s. medical reason getting vaccinated suddenly need hospital care COVID tough shit. Figure out, knew doctors apparently 🤷‍♂️ Yeah I've heard everyone except actual official. puts getting there's seems hard data us already exactly get movie from? went National Museum American Indian 2006 said preferred term, least (obvious based named museum guess). imagine depends ask. 

I know best case using tribal name, that's obviously option context article.  looks like risk death 2x higher Delta original  Scania region still gives AstraZeneca 65+. fact even health minister health background too. topic completely context arrogant dig another complex group people everyone random boundary area live people things differently people random boundary area.

The need make yourself, somehow country live directly tied identity, creates nothing conflict gross.  Keep masks mandatory national vaccine average hits threshold say 65% vaccine (or mask) like goal keeper block 65% (or 95%) shots goal. community transmission means shots goal. Yeah. specified thats buddy said wanted travel to. article says planning travel Germany I'd like know % breakthrough infections result long covid though. Dying covid bad, life ruined it. Thanks correction; edited Decades manufacturing consent make population dumb vulnerable malign outside influence. Never tried? guess millions people vaccinated count? wanted point multiple studies actually show athsmatic people heightened risk covid, anything might actually lower risk non athsmathics contrary worries early pandemic hypothesized may heightened risks. 

A recent robust study specifically children published days ago confirmed this

 obviously still prudent take precautions wanted share case aware, maybe give extra peace mind

Sample source; NYT appears using CDC's data. data includes data sources state local DOH may may access and/or choose use. even vaxxed? user shared article long covid vaccine clearing up. country say recovered Covid get vaccinated one time Biontech Moderna. I’m following. cases increased period curfew apparently antibodies ect recovering Covid getting vaccinated?

My partner Covid back January recieved first dose last month. That’s literally supposed do. COVID positive little/no symptoms, supposed ride home.

Ohhhh ok probably happened Exit festival Serbia too, news still since last weekend England 1.2 1.5, +3% +7% day. Published 9th July new one due tomorrow think.

So let state break law? also shows estimated number infections US (which obviously lot confirmed infections). way sum since beginning find estimated total number US covid infections? google search shows 33.9M confirmed cases US, curious estimated total number US cases. Almost 500,000 UK children tested positive covid-19 since March 2020.

Most medical bodies say normally takes days weeks recover covid-19, make full recovery within 12 weeks.

UK advocacy group Long Covid Kids says currently details 1200 children long covid 890 families England. “And number rising quickly,” says founder Sammie Mcfarland. “Not one returned previous health, unable normal activities.”


500,000 (which know it’s symptomatic cases they’re children experience less severe covid, never got tested) children 1200 long haul could 12 weeks. talking 0.0024% children study experienced long haul symptoms. let’s get back uninformed. Also article case dont believe source. [go home dude can't choose last word people, certain point, stop reading prolonged argument, especially one gets repetitive. Absolutely not.

First all, appear 5,000 health care workers Kudus, vaccinated COVID-19 Sinovac. suggests 4,650 get infected Delta variant. translates 93% protection rate! Moreover, since healthcare workers high risk COVID-19 exposed high levels virus workplace, conclude protection typical person, typical Filipino, would least good 93% higher!

This poor statistics maths. mean ""93% effective"", comparison group. 93% means another group 5,000 healthcare workers compare, infected. Obviously work like that.

Wow u really type that? tell vaccines? let tell vaccines Omg say ain’t so?!!! 😱😱😱😱 story world, America.

We’re stuck aren’t.  know. Somehow invermectin still ""cure"" SEA can't make vaccine mandatory shit country handle Pfizer. forget vaccines like AZ Moderna. Basically, government put lot roadblocks private sector wanted import western vaccines. I'm talking Pfizer. Moderna AZ. funny thing government put lot roadblocks private sector import vaccines themselves. ruling going import 1 million doses, donate amount government. caused huge delay people started complaining gave it. even went far say Astra Seneca demanded condition.

If idea keep corporations rich, Az vaccine much cheaper Pfizer Moderna? ....but taxes homeless rake forests. /s family privelged enough get fully vaccinated still make sure follow masking regulations. Vaccinations numbers sky rocketed avg around 4million 1st doses day surely improving situation (still 30-40k cases per day way better 100-200k per day) wait second doses go 4-12 weeks depending vaccine took. Sadly 5% country fully vaccinated invincible Wave 3 bright side vaccinated 22% population single dose Govt trying best make vaccines free nearest Clinic. Even 300m+ first doses still far away hope Wave 3 goes light us Country cannot afford surely 3rd Lockdown. Still poor vulnerable vaccinated trying best get vaccinated get cheaper treatment around.  Almost Europe requires vaccine enter, what's plan? ADE impossibility, happens vaccinated people, it'll also happen unvaccinated people time. Lol work home go much anyway I'm change anything :D think real world data made clear natural infection offers better immunity covid vaccine. case almost every pathogen encounter. course better vaccinated take chances infection. need many people vaccinated possible. However, rare vaccine elicit better immune response natural infection. aren’t many examples pathogens. Also, Cleveland Clinic study showed none people previously infected whether vaccinated reinfected, small percentage vaccinated people infected. suggests previous infection provides protection vaccines may benefit previously infected individuals, however results statistically significant. Exactly. could argue “intelligent” people pushing vaccines expecting everyone get vaccinated, real intelligent person would know can’t force millions take poke, maybe end us intelligent people stupid ones? Shit.. haha I'd say education lot it, well educated based upon live, generally based upon income. know live red area, uneducated people, vaccination rate low. town work blue college town, vaccination rate much, much higher.

Further, major inflammatory disorders associated covid children leading damage appendages, pretty much anywhere small blood vessels body. Telling someone relax pretty non sensical unless small chance negative side effect doesnt' make sense worry about, i.e.) flying, riding roller coaster, etc.  Yeah, shit.

That's exactly expected vaccines right? remember pfizers phase 3 looking people symptoms regular testing see vaccines worked mild cases without symptoms. dumbest argument literally pointless. 334 million doses administered US.

Edit 3: Chat request inform single child died Covid! wonderful news! /s

ChainsawSuperman, I'm sorry subjected much negativity expressing understandable concerns regarding safety kid pandemic. many children suffered Covid-19.

To date, [300 U.S. died Covid-19. older people still mask even vaccinated CNN is.now threatening kids? anyone putting up.with this? 

Grandma take vax meant sparing grandkids.  French protesting something another Tuesday  ...uh, yeah? Yeah, Fox News, none others that! /s UK too. 18+ year old kid walk street get world's best vaccine.

Some still ending hospital.

I want scream rage.  stat look nearly impressive Israel, partly vaccine slightly less effective Delta, vast majority adults vaccinated, probably engage testing shenanigans do.

Lol, explain celebrities like Natalie Portman allowed bring parents Australia tennis players allowed enter Australians continue stuck overseas? explain politicians continue travel back forth overseas restricting number Australians coming back leaving? explain australia currently near bottom comes vaccine roll prioritising saving lives along? It’s Australians like can’t bear hear become laughing stock internationally, called envy world becoming known world wide hermit nation willing violate citizens human rights abandoning Australians overseas making near impossible come back, restrict people leaving prison island. Jesus would approve fellow carpenter dolt. Turns 30% Washington residents republican. hate statistics like this. say 195/how many hospitalized patients. 195/ every vaccinated person. Spain dictator till 1975 so? drastically opened poorly worded message. Lots people went partying big clubs first J&amp;J shot. Free guns get vaccinated. least common sense. Many republicans We're talking delta variant secondary attack rate, UK estimate best available that. US enough sequencing contact tracing reliable estimate. Although SAR vary depending behavior, UK estimate decent baseline.

Your number interesting illustration given much R varies week week, extrapolating end pandemic week unlikely predict well. Anyway, original context whether everyone unvaccinated 10-20% vaccinated end infected, certainly case, number shows too. Us two progressive dems, family generally votes dem conservative. Fox news, Dr. Oz, likeminded facebook stuff would like print laminate it. I’m tired repeating damn thing day day. yes. yes. yes. vaccine works well can, depending body's response getting it! Exactly, always going happen. It’s sped contagious variant. due technicality using state alarm instead state emergency. That's all. “the delta variant!”

I'd regularly advise people think long hard initial goal time regulations lockdowns. basically two things: 1. prevent serious cases much possible 2. prevent health care system breaking completly vaccination takes effect. initial goals, nothing great like 'no infections Covid'.

The delta variant really much regard metrics. Given stats countries high delta infections **AND** high vaccination rates comparison flu would even overstatement time around regards serious cases deaths. certainly help levelheaded approach constant media hysteria - really want take foot gas one. Likely fear panic far easier clickbaits new royal celebrity bullshit they've way year now. Anyway efficacy measured vaccine right? top individual would performed without vaccine anyway, unless misunderstood done? Well sperm could evolve mutate rate virus could, would escaping condoms getting everyone pregnant 😆 Gosh, that's surprise... Actually several states US governors passed laws prevent public schools government buildings mandating masks. Kids wear want to, school can't force it.

Businesses can, that's want not. know two care home workers refused vaccine 'want children one day'. may caring people, often educated. saying protect vulnerable get 'but already vaccinated old children.'


Sigh. think lot well one's immune system works vaccination. people hard time triggering immune response. would concerned, panicking person immunity issues. would one may fight little harder stop replication virus body vs. someone large immune response destroys virus cause illness (covid).  I’d love stay home since I’m autoimmune bills pay. Market dynamics explain it.

They happy let vast numbers population die see people disposable long protect enforce right wealth. want kings queens life, even riches, title alone. bit complicated. Ok apply delta covid stats analogy. 53,822 people hospital wearing “seatbelts” 44 died = .08%
Compared 7,235 hospital “seatbelts” 50 died = .7%
I guess less chance getting “car crash” vaccine get crash 10 fold increase dying “seatbelt” on. used quite cruises would leave San Juan. problem airfare. MIA/FLL nonstop reasonably priced flights every city US. San Juan not. look races avoiding vaccine, makes sense certain areas nearly vaccinated others struggle I'm FB can't agree disagree, news articles say parents entire family vaccinated except him. 

Just responsible getting shots publicly encouraging others get shots too, they're far better eyes rather ""just bad."" they're weird defensive kid, cares. Vaccinated vaccinated. Makes sense. went public school smart. I’m fully vaccinated still little concerned I’m struggling understanding real risk is. Thanks Yes. Like France. 4-5 months cufew, cases 'go down' 17000 40000.

It aligns every medical body guidance. 

AAP-
“Schools, child care programs, camps encouraged continue support use face masks children staff vaccine available younger age groups vaccinations within pediatric population high enough prevent transmission - 

“In areas widespread transmission, adults age 60 general good health wear fabric masks cannot guarantee least 1-metre distance others. particularly important adults working children may close contact children one -

“All schools implement layer prevention strategies prioritize universal correct use masks physical - 

“While programs longer mandated follow transitional pandemic requirements, important note significant number Ohioans, including children age 12, remain unvaccinated. such, programs remain vigilant efforts slow spread virus following guidance issued Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC): Schools Child Care Guidance, updated April 27, 2021.”

“Masks: masks longer required, beginning June 2, 2021, STRONGLY ENCOURAGED providers adhere CDC guidance, states unvaccinated populations still mask socially distance.”

I simply think continue precautions place last school year least everyone chance vaccinated. What’s rush stop basics we’re close? Credit it’s due. Trump play positive role getting vaccines arms. Stupid was, wasn’t always 100% stupid. So, general terms, 52.5% adults Germany received shots vaccine, additional 18.3% first shot.

The RKI document linked contains break-down two age groups:

- people 60 double-vaxxed 70%, undefined number (12-14%?) received first shot.

- people 18-60 years age, 40% double-vaxxed, whereas clearly defined estimate around 16% received first shot.

I wished elaborate age-group breakdown, could find. Apart fact less 2% minors fully vaccinated, number received first shot.

----------------------------

Vaccination slowdown: 

49 million people Germany received least one shot vaccine; since conservative estimates say 52.7 million adult, eligible people willing vaccinated point, slowdown almost inevitable.

Last week, 4,3 million jabs (1st 2nd doses) happening country; week 5 million, week 5.6 million.

Rising case numbers:

Incidence numbers Germany much lower many European countries, rising fast. lowest point one two weeks ago around 5 new cases (rolling 7-day-average) 100.000 people. around 8. government speaking 50 55 % rise week-to-week.

Journalists broken numbers bit more, say past two weeks case numbers actually rather stable within age-groups, 20-29-year age group number rising significantly.

In (even narrow) age-band 20-24, incidence-rate rose 10 19 (per 100.000 people), whereas age-group 75-84, stayed continuously 1.

Wonderful world want live in. 

You masochist know that. letting people die baseless beliefs.

Idk pervasive. living south I’ve heard many things. Apparently Pepsi aborted fetus cells it. Why? guess makes taste sweeter something…  Killing satisfy world domination fantasies. Dictators always alike.  Seen internal #s %s unvaccinated within ethnicity - 15% asian, 15% white, 35% latino, 35% pacific islander, 45% african american.

Some communities going get hit really hard next 1-3 months.  That's deliberately vague wrong. Adaptive immunity well established credible scientific fact. It’s going change. vaccines beat variant. mutate much longer effective attacking human body. vaccines block spike proteins matter what. 

Stop worrying vaccinated. It’s never going away long live. news talk next variant over. Dietary advice written medications even GP say anything. UK we're given sheet paper listing foods avoid. 


Beyond - sure exactly expect GP do? Diagnose underlying cause?? likelihood stress diet, combination both. GP advise patient alter diet, people ignore it. Stress hard GP spot short appointment, although patient information leaflet.  


The key thing GP's perspective treat symptoms quickly otherwise risk ulcers developing, become serious quite quickly. people medication month two - THAT's going impact vitamin deficiencies fractures. 


Beyond that, patient really. easy answers.

It’s good idea Lyft allowing option share ride certain places nationwide rollout would disaster. Many cities differing views masking could lead fights arguments. Idk I’m quite happy “guinea pig”, considering hundreds millions others also largely unaffected it. Turns fine, “99.x%” get it. 

I’d rather get safe vaccine covid. 

Not mention “untested” “guinea pig” claims far removed reality hurts :/ Ugh. Good lord.

In Canada (some provinces) add annoying layer serves counter someone taking lazy this. take vaccination education course (in person). 

It hasn’t applied COVID vaccinations, far it’s used parents refuse give kids 9 mandatory vaccinations require start school here. think lot issues public health officials moving goalposts vaccinated people. whole, “just you’re vaccinated doesn’t mean you’re safe” attitude doesn’t exactly instill confidence getting vaccine vaccine hesitant people. Instead messaging been, “Once fully vaccinated, go back 100% normal life”.

Not alot people get messaging designed give 100% confidence dying virus. Nobody wants wear masks rest eternity. People want normality.

The numbers don’t lie. 98% Covid hospitalizations among unvaccinated, proves vaccines work. CDC Fauci need start Chad like saying vaccines work save you. Well, we'll see pans out, certainly hope announce thresholds soon. partner's families NZ, incredibly frustrating see dither vaccination offer goals terms time frames vaccination thresholds opening border. 

Considering current vaccination skepticism around 23% adults alone, I'm skeptical reach anywhere near 70-85% full vaccination population without forcing people. say, hopefully current outbreak Aus speeds sluggish vaccination rollout, hopefully complacency set cause low vaccination ceiling overall. got 100%.

Yeah, likely, computers internet access, except local library. Right. I'd consider claiming antivax meant could work home hieghtened risk getting COVID get COVID, thats another story altogether. medical exemption unvaccinated cost job healthcare. computers access local library. bet research Fox News, that. tried put perspective how, USA, 160 million us vaccinated basically one died vaccine, 34 million us infected covid 600,000 us died.

Had tons people downvoting me, trying correct me, bullshitting basically direction try undermine point.

We’re informational siege military grade psyops campaign. Delta doesn’t truly change this

Some studies suggest either significant impact hospitalization, others say doubled hospitalization rate. pending approval, children still extremely low risk even current worst case seen lot comments many kids danger kids terrified COVID wasn’t sure statistics bore out

All takes simple Google search. Reading clickbait titles like echoing causes fear basis data research. would expect sub, honest. options waiting receive brand 1st injection (pfizer) getting brand vaccine (moderna).

I'd like know nordic country says things. work 2 guys early 20’s, Puerto Rican intelligent. refuse get vaccinated, work pharmacy sick people come time.

It’s really frustrating vaccinated San Francisco pretty safe pandemic even vaccines. Using overall numbers misleading because, again, logic vaccinated highly protective. 

If trying look direct protective effect personally vaccinated, **it's basically lowers chance 1/5th infection 1/20th severe cases (Delta variant)** compared similarly situated unvaccinated person. wear mask, one stop you. friend wearing one 10l% safe.  We're one hyper militarized nations Earth. really surprise? Imagine actually thinking lol true. Effectivity Chile found 66% symptomatic COVID 86% hospitalization.    

That's basically Johnson number, never heard people complaining Johnson. Damn it. ‘* called it!
LA literally announced new mask mandate requiring masks indoor whether vaccinated unvaccinated minutes commented. Love people downvoting despite modelling showing peak last longer! people seriously deluded enough think peak go quick lockdown scenario, feel weeks. Vaccination still mandatory except healthcare workers. said, mandatory vaccines workers always thing. Surgeons, RNs, etc. still option get vaccinated choice consequences access cafés, malls, strict travel rules, etc. Get goddamn shots inbred lunatics. barely 2 months since Pfizer applied one month since Moderna applied. applied priority review, meaning make decision within 6 months. takes time review data make decision. also don’t want appear rushed would add vaccine hesitancy. antivax sentiment, result tremendous amount vaccinations done last 3 months. Eventually supply exceed demand. good happened around 70% population instead 50%. Canada look around 75% entire population fully vaccinated end August. Yeah, shit! Misinformation lethal pandemic happening densely interconnected highly populated planet, dangerous. Who'd thunk it? elderly, diabetic, treated cancer, organ transplant recipient, consider going cases high. healthy young middle aged person, go good time. authority though? start vaccinating group Friday, means fully vaccinated 30ish days + additional 14 days get effect second dose. even fair take 1.5 months group. literally penalizing young protect old anti-vaxers group fully vaccinated people still end hospital (which also happen young fully vaccinated). Right. 10 million people LA 3 million that. People need get vaccinated. It’s annoying. shouldn’t even discussion.  commented, social media platform… can’t make uninformed statements children 12 they’ll react vaccine they’re even able get yet.

I made statements children 12 potential reactions vaccine. case aware, trials 2-5 6-11 cohorts currently underway speak results trials expected analyzed least another month two. trials conducted precisely help determine potential risks weigh potential benefits. 

Your initial point small sample size vaccinated 12-15 year olds false. 1 3 children age group received least one dose far, 1 4 received two doses. authorized FDA almost 3 months ago. Plenty real world data already (and continue grow) disprove assertion equal risks. makes sense. train left station. start seeing news like we've seeing week, know get ugly. Thanks antivaxxers! surprise, knew people left devices selfish assholes? 

USA needs something similar. vaccine cards insufficient, could easily done something loads phone ID.

They record shot, can't difficult, morons think shot tracking device getting shot anyways would love know idiots bar, restaurant, store, park, gas station in. absolutely ITT: people confusing ""too early rule out"" ""confirmed beyond doubt""  end? 
Or continue punish fully vaxxed. Don’t see vaccination rates increasing significantly anytime soon US either. Quebec 18-29 worst performing group 69% one shot. similar story around Canada. Oof. sounds really difficult. think important treat cases respect – yes, agree getting vaccinated, calling people ""morons"" ""idiots"" good.

I think seems pretty core incompatibility though. partner extremely anti-vax, would make anxious think make every effort calmly educate stuff. important her, listen – communication key all.

If can't hear without fighting coming sort compromise (although personally would compromise this) I'm afraid bigger red flags here. Pardon me, proof outlandish statements?

A well researched tabulated bibliography comment would wonders engender redditors taking obviously well researched comment seriously! okay add this: larger gap 1st doses Canada due almost entirely supply issues early on. 2nd doses absolutely flying.

Currently sitting 79.5% Canadians 12 partially fully vaccinated. Go moon  Going bar need. want. Younger people wait particular want they're vaccinated. agree. Seems pretty clear ditching mask mandate premature. Nope, comply. go again… anti vax. anti health passport. Even vaccinated people protesting it. French asked download app, log show qr code pretty much everywhere go. mRNA vaccine tech's existed decade. J&amp;J closer old-school stuff we've century. Nothing glopped lab overnight. Even emergency approvals must undergo vigorous testing.

Covid dangers established fact. Covid survivors can, do, experience long Covid, even mild cases. (That must fun. /s) That, fact want next Typhoid Mary, gleefully spreading disease, makes getting vaccine obvious choice.

PHS mainly sailors, early America relied trade exports nations via boat, couldn’t afford sailors sick, unable work, unable afford “medical treatments” time (cocaine). 48k tested positive last 24hours. risen 50k day. get over, trying tell fully vaccinated people here?

I'd said deterministic since probably ones getting right ones late also anti vaxers time lives saying ""you see, told going making mandatory"". Even vaccinated people supporting protest health passport go everywhere.

This may actually counter productive even temporary jump vaccination. We'll see. 'Sure, give you, prove said correct? Like sources?' data Delta variant less deadly? I'm virologist, viruses typically get less deadly mutate? CDC’s recommendations based Trump-appointee-approved talking points, based “the science.” Globally, they’re embarrassment politicised “health” org. Oh okay, understand emotional support speedos.  I'd support Covid carve-out.

A friend's stepson lives Florida hospital Covid second time. Got months ago, went hospital couple weeks, got recently landed hospital two weeks. still refuses get vaccine. costs stays (the last 100% preventable) passed us. original variant best estimated around 3. Old estimates may reference 2 early studies data amount asymptomatic infection relied suspect / limited testing. 

6-7 completely realistic Delta. even tearing relatively high-vax populations like hot knife butter. even able spread degree success military ship 100% vaccinated folks (admittedly germ factories, still, impressively contagious).

The study *not* show 20% Americans test positive Covid require hospital care.

Here’s key passage:

“For study, National COVID Cohort Collaborative Consortium researchers analyzed electronic health records nearly 2 million adults tested COVID-19 34 hospitals United States Jan. 1 Dec. 7, 2020.”

So, study looks people tested positive Covid *at hospitals*, either means symptoms severe enough go hospital, hospital seeking treatment condition/problem/disease.

The study way looks *general public*, far analyzing Covid tests doctor’s offices, pharmacies, labs, non-urgent facilities.

Also, present tense headline (“needs” hospital care) hides fact study done *last year*, mass vaccination effort.

This worst sort headline writing — it’s fearmongering worst, needs called out. talking point vaccine useless fully vaccinated people getting COVID now. really trolling best. update vaccine children 12?

Flu seasons vary severity, however every year children risk
CDC estimates since 2010, flu-related hospitalizations among children younger 5 years old ranged 7,000 26,000 United States.
While relatively rare, children die flu year. Since 2004-2005, flu-related deaths children reported CDC regular flu seasons ranged 37 199 deaths. (During 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu-related deaths reported CDC April 2009 September 2010.) noteworthy among reported pediatric deaths, 80% children fully vaccinated. Also note, even though individual flu deaths children must reported CDC, likely deaths captured number actual deaths higher. CDC developed statistical models account underreporting flu-related deaths children estimate actual number deaths. 2018-2019, example, 199 deaths children reported CDC statistical modeling suggests approximately 434 deaths may occurred. information pediatric deaths since 2004-2005 flu season available interactive flu web stop. see 3, direction doesn’t really change enough ones labeled 1-2-3 count separate, IMO. kids eligible parents let get ?

Unfortunately, lot people misunderstand intended message article. Basically, old people die COVID young people. vaccine’s benefit isn’t sufficient cancel difference. 

Still, according article, vaccination provides 20-fold benefit compared peers. dead dead, living continue Yeah sure don’t 600k dead 

Yeah surely ""long term emotional mental health damage"" 600k people dying. people families know? Get perspective. way without degree hardship. countries gone pandemic less hardship Australia has. show it?

We thousands dead people. painfully obvious beneficial outcome measures put place. Apparently irrelevant though.

Prioritising saving lives heartless picture painting. 💯 - liability vaccine manufactures


That's new covid vaccines though, way since 80s. 42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22, ""No vaccine manufacturer shall liable civil action damages arising vaccine-related injury death associated administration vaccine October 1, 1988, injury death resulted side effects unavoidable even though vaccine properly prepared accompanied proper directions warnings. sound like happy happened him. Across state, seven children hospitalized COVID-19, fighting dangerous virus intensive care units. Two ventilators.

2 7 numbers saw article. Wish could see article went bit details demographics people currently hospitalized covid across US. I've heard many people say symptoms cleared return 2 weeks.  feel like I’ve seen news/updates—glad see this.

Where find updates?

Edit: scroll little farther found links :) truckloads dead bodies like clue people. 7% 4 total cases (out 54). Delta going get vulnerable (vaccinated) people, especially states terribly low rates vaccination. 

There nothing this, start lock downs high risk areas, convince people way lockdowns get damn jabs. going happen either, guess sit back let people die more. Well that’s one ignorant way looking this. Oof. sorry, understand things advacado toast speak   given getting people vaxxed?

""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" 

 - MS GOP Equally interesting people pro lifers accusing women (or even girls) selfish bodies protect babies life else. Good. public thank protecting lives coughing every chance get that's vaccines work. idea prevent deaths serious illness. overwhelmingly that.

Do even know 75% effective means? Let's say population 10000 disease kills 1% without vaccine vaccine 75% effective. Instead killing 100 people, kills 25. That's incredibly significant. case mrna vaccines, I've heard quote make likelihood dying c19 would flu. live odds every year. impression trying phrase things way believed would encourage people seek vaccines. Maybe worried, been. Cases low, Delta horizon. virus already left China even recognized existing. nothing CCP could do. 

And China one countries able eliminate community spread COVID within borders (at times insanely brutal tactics). China variant concern factory like world today brings us joys like Alpha Delta.

I defending China - government human rights disaster. pointing fingers China laughable. Interesting vaccine 85 90% effective. tell 86% covid patients unvaccinated nationally known hospital Jacksonville FL.  Wish could give award I’m broke moment.  You’re alone. Pulled son extracurricular group decided move meetings person, we’re going switch homeschooling fall hopefully get vaccine.

It sucks we’re trying everything make life home interesting it’s worth long time health risks / chance death prevent it. mean, beautiful nature places pretty much every state, get bonus Arkansas :P Thanks man, needed that. guess everyone got vaccinated, one person died covid, 100% covid deaths would among vaccinated.  caught covid plane back september wearing n95 dropped mask requirements TN too. even encouraging them. Teachers aren’t required vaccinated. It’s massive clusterfuck. vaccine 12 cannot come soon enough, we’ll probably still continue mask antivax morons get covid die maybe recover get “vaccinated” way. It’s also lot, mean *lot* easier accidentally OD heroin die OD alcohol. 

I don’t think locking people using drug all, certain drugs completely restricted, opioids 100% one them. Still think given free good rehab versus prison, prison drug use *rarely* helps anyone. 

I dont know you’ve ever actually opioids, *extremely* addictive *extremely* dangerous. I’ve Fentanyl, Morphine, Hydros/Vicodin different major injuries surgeries, see horrific opioid epidemic. They’re extremely addictive chemical level psychological level, numbing world like nothing else. wasn’t extreme pain (at time) surgery injuries, would never touch them. 

It’s also extremely easy accidentally OD alcohol opioids (and benzos too, almost learnt one hard way) combined. They’re bad news, probably stigmatization illegal. come hospitals treatment cities high vaxx rates.  relatives outside lobby protesting Covid diagnosis, saying flu money grab doctors.  Imagine taking time day argue random person internet wrong worried kid getting COVID-19.

This happens basically every single post subreddit kids come up. Oxford study showed measurable brain loss. indication why, measured it.

So yah, think things happening. Meanwhile, 70% Canadians (not 16 up) least one dose. yeah that's great. pretty good though wore n95 last year. hard breathe tiring 9 hour work day. Vaccinated wearing surgical masks year. Yep. Notice everyone writes vaccinated old immunocompromised people died covid ""they old weak immune systems...*shrug*"" I'm seeing people report they're suffering loss taste/smell alongside bad flu/cold don’t think they’ll get themselves….until becomes serious it’s late unfortunatly lost whatever credibility left brought 1984 lmaoo weird balance him. I'll take it. husband vaccinated still try leave house I’m worried son. gets it, yea, he’ll *probably* fine, don’t want risk long term effects worse. I’m kind parent. would hope so. know relapse extremely common addicts, whether alcohol narcotics. usually stress strongly anybody trying kick addiction get narcan let loved one know use it. Washington ""mature minor"" (definition discretion doctor) could even get vaccination without either parent's consent. Well technically slower get vaccinated vaccines send. we're using less them. 

But there's plenty people countries refuse vaccine. US unique that. saying possible individuals vaccinated may test positive PCR yet contagious? math. fake statistics. I'm even vaccine, think article extremely misleading anyone knows anything statistics would agree.

The data January 1st. many people even vaccinated back then? know. % people vaccinated changes every single day. Could've 0 people vacced first months. even including data back barely anyone even fully vaccinated?

This like discovering potential cure cancer saying ""since 1990, 1% cancer patients took new medicine died cancer"". mean moving forward, 99% people taking medicine would cured? NO.

A fairer dataset would set unchanging vaccination rate period time:
For example, June December, 70% people fully vaccinated. Of, X amount covid cases, vaccinated Z total number deaths.

Again, everyone vacced articles like make people trust media. literally viral disease lasting effects well Yo...you better bro. anyone vaccinated still got covid tell symptoms long-haulers among you?

I vaccinated country many despite state emergency lot carelessness.... family young children still won’t get vaccinated. didn’t care wear masks either pandemic long except work. someone lost multiple immediate family (not due covid) way sooner been, sucks kids annoys got lose family happily roaming whole time yup sorry funding that.. important things money....

Not Americans (hard American media understand....)

This assuming vaccines available safe effective. No, rich. Even within King County, poorer areas much lower vaccination rates. Older people UK overwhelmingly vaccinated. Like 95%+ oldest age groups. Vaccines could catch vs practically one dies covid get vaccine=very clear winner. clearly read citations. Cleveland Clinic showed 100% protection, stronger vaccination. 

Your comment said protected “against specific variation”. That’s case, none studies suggest protected variants. national dataset country nationalized healthcare data collection. PCR tests given symptomatic asymptomatic people.

I’m statistician fail see makes data “better”. scale study means consistency oversight almost impossible. Smaller, far controlled studies highly detail methodology lot statistical weight.

yes read conclusion, entire article one page would hard miss.

There dozen studies finding protection levels far higher “best data available”. Scale make something “best data”, zero respectable mathematicians would say that, sorry.

Never tried tho Thank you! Well said US, little half vehicular fatalities people wearing seatbelts--because people wear seatbelts--so yes, right. even though article say this, assume UK like US older people likely get vaccinated. 
 
So, highest risk like aged get vaccinated most, *far fewer* die Covid19 result, due fact still die vaccine enough overcome highly elevated risk, unvaccinated people say, ""Oh vaccine work."" maddening. feel bad parents well, assessing 335 died lockdowns PPE mandates, could guess outcome would otherwise. thing older vulnerable back Spring 2020 people needed live life.

Recent found post ragging COVID vaccine saying one way CDC captures data side effects researches tried fix got cold shoulder. posted shit tons links CDC, good research papers, actual gov resources. Simply following links little Google completely trashed whole argument showed CDC actually using project said got cold shouldered. Sadly luckily echo chamber 


The crazy part present really good info experience side effects get compensation. Yeah two hospitals. 

Fairfield pretty small, sends critical cases Liverpool, largest hospital Southern Hemisphere. small is, strange staff-to-patient ratio (at least time - rumour Fairfield reputedly highest state). 

Royal North Shore Hospital North Sydney, huge. guessing working part-time job nursing assistant there, bulk university student placement block Fairfield, 50km west/south west. 

I guess focused COVID threat coming patients instead staff. 

It strange COVID jab part compulsory immunisation schedule nursing students (also medical allied health too). even hit wards, undergo checks NSWHealth state's health department. 

With occurred here, policy need change (subject vaccine supply, course). notice adverse sleep effects it, frankly I've pretty much stopped anyhow. I'll keep advice mind future though thank sharing.  understanding percent represents effective vaccine compared without vaccine. baseline unvaccinated group. 

So 10 unvaccinated people group 100 got infected, 1 vaccinated person group 100 infected. 

In words, vaccines reduce chance getting infected compared unvaccinated. news sources these??? think would done great? Everything happening new everybody. might easy looks.

Netherlands testing way previous wave.  Didn’t lose taste smell all? wondering effective vaccine preventing that. Covid December really looking lose senses god forbid get reinfected.  Oh, report them. Always.

Lol that's like necessary pettiness internet whenever I'm circumstance. Tho often simply leave argument, since arguing people know internet tends prolonged war attrition neither sides win. Surgeon General. Jerome Adams previous Surgeon General. That’s literally like month away. Keeping indoor masking seems pretty reasonable solution. Thank clarifying.

Pop Covid Positive subreddit see uncommon catch covid. vaccines intended prevent deaths hospitalization, necessarily prevent contracting it, especially around covid positives without masks prolonged period time.  Covid. Antisocial behavior individuals groups taken strong uptick level wildly different usual gradual rate change trends. Something up.   extremely common tactic certain political ideology right now, make familiar it, gonna notice everywhere. don’t know help I’ve known two contracted virus vaccination, would deemed ‘mild’ context didn’t require hospitalization supplemental oxygen, 30s. One mild manifested headache congestion, compared sinus/allergy symptoms. second man worked Covid patients hospital. symptoms severe go ER breathing problems said like bad upper respiratory infection. given standard inhaler steroids sent home. worst symptoms lasted two days, felt back normal week. vaccines job. 

As far long Covid, haven’t seen research vaccinated long haulers would speculate would low given vaccines used treat long hauler symptoms. Every voting cycle wait hoping does!

It's coming lord days want move away again. live Houston raised East Texas let tell stark contrast. anyone know much vaccination coverage one Pfizer shot exposed Delta variant? pediatrician said son (18 months) itd sometime next year hilarious Reddit updooting post misinformation spread it. Yeah, no. free speech dumb ignorant subject. crime mislead intent profit harm someone.  understanding: Lets say airplane 200 passengers. 100 vaxed/100 non-vaxed.

if flight attendant super spreading delta covid throughout entire 8 hour flight. Here's think #'s work....

if 100 non-vaxed people became covid positive.... 70% effective vax infection would mean 30 passengers vaxed group also became positive.

if 10 non-vaxed people went hospital 90% effective vax severe covid would mean 1 vaxed passenger went hospital. 1. Romania even fully understand level authorisation EMA given vaccines, doubt others do.

2. Long term side effects really occur vaccines. We've given two billion common long-lasting ones observed.

3. case Europe. We’re days past comments already aging really poorly: hospitalizations 22% deaths 5% nationally. Missouri, hospitalizations 42% deaths 43%.

Florida, hospitalizations 57% deaths 49%.

Louisiana, 50% 48%.

These states Delta dominant. next two weeks, Delta completely taken rest country, too. good! 4 level alert system NZ. single community case appears without known link border go Level 3 lockdown 3 days whole region appeared in, border closed police military. rest country goes Level 2, capacity limits social distancing. cases found lockdown extended. Masks strongly recommended Alert levels 3 4, mandated. 

Level 4 ever used March-April 2020. That's serious Wuhan-style lockdown. Level 3 used twice. August 2020 February 2021. Level 3 stricter Australian lockdowns closes retail nearly workplaces. 

The rest time we're Level 1, basically normal. know bucket fall generally. stopped getting flu vaccine years ago always catch flu, every year, getting vaccinated made slightly worse.

Hopefully, stay covid. That’s scary  That’s contracting Fun fact: Covid also GI Yeah.... Tell stupid logic people lost loved ones see makes difference. 

I care call it. Get vaccinated suffer consequences. CDC advised vaccinated people need covid test. One many recommendations make zero sense. There's many vaccinated folks getting sick, think CAN'T covid get tested. Also, CDC tracking covid positives vaccinated unless hospitalized. 

I believe individual states are, though. Yes, many first world countries giving vaccine away.... US happens focusing Central America South America now. also 3rd world conditions, unfortunately vaccines given quickly produced, can't given everybody once. many 1st world countries invest manufacturing supply.

Just country seeing right mean happening. People Honduras, example, deserve too. easier US ship them. Pakistan, flip side, areas generally distrustful Western vaccines, something caused chaos past organizations like Doctors without Borders straight attacked trying vaccination drives. Donating US made vaccines could cause people refuse vaccination due perceptions, likely topping donation list right practical reasons.

What asking countries abandon citizens foreign nationals. Governments responsibility citizens. slowing, helping nations. France well-known vaccine-skepticism issue. Dutch one, health instances (GGD-GHOR) reporting device work sufficiently well used all. least going get diabetes.. winning Chile mainly using sinovac. According goverment Delta widespread think that's BS. explanation would us average 100 daily deaths since march? call bs that, I'd say Delta widespread finally cases dropping like flies hospital beds slowly emptying. Take grain salt. Maybe Sinovac good delta means 100% people got vaccine, chances catching covid exposure incident reduced 95%

This inaccurate. means trial, 95% fewer people vaccine got COVID people get vaccine duration trial. There's real way measure number ""exposure incidents"" someone interacts vaccination.

It also true provides protection severe illness even become sick. plenty nurses job refusing get vaccinated. One mentioned want infertile it.

Very low vaccination rate among CNAs especially. Variety reasons I've heard them. hate shots. never get sick matter. think bad ingredient vaccine. think vaccine contains virus make sick.

We made flu vaccine mandatory last year everyone flipped shit. quit. lied said religious cant get it. side isn’t “pro”-anything. Literally, don’t moral ground stand besides self-righteously pointing fingers side. personification screaming woman meme pineapple pizza. Por que Los dos?

Low income countries need vaccine donations think pretty good metaphor. Viral load something effectiveness vaccines. know concrete numbers higher viral load exposed to, higher likelihood contracting virus; choose still wear mask even though fully vaccinated. think 95% figure average. Depending viral load exposure may go down. let’s worry good somewhere sometime new variant emerge, promising.

We won’t able vaccinate people long mandatory, end game? normal cult members may severe even alpha potential severe disease cases. delta contagious degree severity, provides patients opportunities severe disease. It’s hard utilize critical thinking. Easier said done.  post - surprising amount others like thread - great example anti-vax misinformation poor reasoning works undercut scientific expertise, regardless whether OP intended much not. First, make extremely overgeneralized statement, ""lots misinformation experts."" Then, scour media offer single example presumed expert incorrect (usually taken context well).

So, policy makers across Europe learning bad example open up, Dutch politicians already discussing allow festivals bigger events using - somewhat “improved” - access tests… best friend 25 baby home putting getting vaccinated.

Unless medical reason get vaccinated, absolutely get it. Don’t smartass selfish prick. Half country gotten vaccine, it’s pretty clearly safe, really isn’t thing long term side effects vaccines. something wrong vaccine, show matter months, years.

Democratic National Committee reportedly wants Short Message Service (SMS) carriers step police private text messages part new push COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.

Allies President Joe Biden, including DNC, plan “engage fact-checkers aggressively” work alongside phone companies combat misinformation vaccines shared via social media private SMS messages, according Monday report Politico.

White House officials particularly frustrated the characterization Republicans of door-to-door pro-vaccination campaign, according report.

One example SMS message cited Politico sent conservative activist group Turning Point USA, co-founder Charlie Kirk falsely contends “Biden sending goons DOOR-TO-DOOR make take Covid-19 vaccine. Sign petition to: medical raids America.”

“When see deliberate efforts spread misinformation, view impediment country’s public health shy away calling out,” White House spokesman Kevin Munoz told Politico.

Big Tech platforms corporate media outlets have consistently cracked down on alleged “misinformation” throughout pandemic, cases, they’ve censored suppressed information turned true. Perhaps chief example lab-leak theory, hypothesizes pandemic originated accidental leak virus Wuhan Institute Virology China.

The Biden administration has blamed misinformation contributing vaccine hesitancy slowing country’s vaccination campaign. Biden set goal achieving 70% vaccination rate July 4, U.S. fell short benchmark.

“The failure provide accurate public health information, including efficacy vaccines accessibility people across country, including South Carolina, literally killing people, maybe consider that,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.

Biden’s door-to-door outreach plan involves sending volunteer community religious leaders households areas low vaccination rates share information available COVID-19 vaccines U.S, overwhelmingly safe effective. outreach efforts ongoing several months less-vaccinated communities.

Polling indicates that many remaining vaccine holdouts aren’t necessarily difficulty hearing accessing shots, simply don’t want them. federal officials blaming politics.

“The big misinterpretation Fox News whomever else saying essentially envisioning bunch federal workers knocking door, telling you’ve got something don’t want do,” NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday. “That’s absolutely case, it’s trusted messengers part community – government officials. that’s think disconnect is.” yet actually happened.

has it.    job seattle 5 people refuse get vaccinated still wear masks. except higher percent people don’t die seatbelts on… logic flawed. question still valid countries. US education prices private schools charts, many state schools offer relatively cheap free options. want people access affordable education, I'm exactly board paying ""full college experience"".

Regardless, anything, covid restrictions would killed fun would much focused supposed actually paying for. 78% 12+, removing 12-17 put us 80s somewhere think. You’re misunderstanding interpret vaccine efficacy. vaccines work everyone, except rare instances. 10% don’t work for. 

What efficacy number means vaccinated 90% less likely catch covid exposed compared someone unvaccinated. 

So let’s say situation without vaccine would 50% chance getting covid. vaccine would 90% less like chance catching 5%. Hope helps! grandma’s neighbor (who 70+) got vaccine months ago. Couple days later stroke. previous history stroke vax. wish making up. 

Say want correlation, people don’t wanna take chance. get that.   know everyone struggling it.  sister's hospital St. Louis area really starting see toll taking mental health doctors nurses.  may, thankfully, like everywhere.

Actually think people realize error calculation scary. think types articles problem people minds vastly overestimate protective effect vaccination. mean, great, 99% protective mortality. basing behaviors policies accurate understanding. Every country negotiate vaccine. America paid up. Breastfeeding always work always option plenty reasons. great can, pressure new moms breastfeed perfectly perfect amount time already sky high.

With genome sequencing attention many scientists, would impossible fabricate new variant. many front lines seeing increase cases, far many funerals fake. Come son. I'm saying using world class medical care accuse doctors faking virus make money. like Trump's speech? got elected right? nearly 50% voted got votes .. I’m right you. It’s like they’re trying give covid kids Population density plays role. 

For example, terms community spread, 20% population unvaccinated would make bigger difference highly populated city like NYC LA rural states lower populations like Maine Vermont. kid picks virus up, statistically fine, you. What's important project anxieties them. let cat bag rescinding lockdown measures. Going back would extremely unpopular, potentially career ending politicians. admit already Sinovac sucks?

Sure, please first cite primary scientific papers Exactly! put safety measures place 2-3 months. anxiety people need really stop blaming Sinovac need look obvious problem front them

People love blaming Sinovac Chinese vaccine can't stop politicizing matter.  Thank sacrifice. nothing sane person impactful moving Texas. You’re important work.

This ends Texas flips. Exactly. vaccines incredibly good, calculation overestimates protective effect vaccines using deaths back Jan. 1, point almost nobody vaccinated massive winter surge cases deaths. hand, using deaths last month also lead astray since vaccinated unvaccinated populations different demographics (we vaccinated high percentage elderly, lot fewer younger people). trivial estimate protective effect vaccines since carefully control populations demographics. guess Japan sending special flights evacuate citizens believe internet stranger Whats Einstein quote insanity again?

And say someone avoided nearly forms person social interaction year vaccinated. avoided small group associates full 14 months. I'm still things gradually right now.

Frankly, I'm fed people's behavior. despite anti-vaxxers, also despise people's arrogance willingness dismiss real suffering (and still is) happening people fallout this. Sure, blame irresponsible people nothing wildly recklessly risked lives love ones (You know side political aisle fall on), whole developed serious total lack empathy throughout whole thing greatly damaged view lot people I'm honest.  Cost double lung transplant $1,295,900. Cost Vaccine $0. 

Hope worth ""waiting see"". known real number like saying okay vaccinated people, hope since spread delta still, mask help reduce spread 2% anything help. Realy old information. Shows sweden 56% passed 70% yesterday. September 4 first game. Exactly point. Apples vaccinated group dying more? would need vaccinated affect them? start? hard feel heartbroken south, kids 12 still option vaccinated. Hurr Durr 'Merica bad.

That schadenfreude sure addictive thing it? Especially perfect Canada is, issues recent problems right? tell vaccines? Decent explainer. put context large age-based risk covid mortality using examples like article offers; even majority (95%) elderly vaccinated highly efficacious vaccines (~95% protection death) typical person 75+ year age bracket still ~165 times higher risk death typical person age group 15-24 (many currently unvaccinated ) . vaccines rolled 15-24 age group uptake increases risk younger age group can/will decrease further, widening disparity. 

Even extreme comparison: age groups 1-4 year old, course completely unvaccinated; risk covid related mortality still 9,545 (yes, 9 thousand times) lower risk almost entirely fully vaccinated 75+ year old groups. 

This downplaying vaccines (the overall IFR across ages reduced 0.085% help them) highlighting even fully immunized, older people especially consider staying bit cautious. 

Source: Age stratified current IFR point populations getting vaccinated versus getting vaccinated different. It’s comparing apples apples. Archive link:  mean, even Spokane huge invasion people decided priced King county. definitely shift area, still largely red. Good thing don’t kids 🤷🏻 gave good effort dude still could figure you’re trying say. Comment like transcript Trump speech something.  county went zero cases four ….. That’s infinite growth ….. better retreat bunkers zero sympathy ones refused vaccine contacted covid almost exactly year ago. 
My sinuses still hurt on. I'm vaccinated, slightly better, entirely  No. Ahh, get it. Thanks explaining 😊 Thx info. Makes sense. mRNA vaccine production still lacking globally.   many partially vaccinated (first shot) admitted hospital? normalize median income education. difference disconnected public health system choosing demonize disdain health efforts political purposes. democracy ever going physically strap people chair inject them. imprison them. Otherwise would 'mandatory' really mean practice? 

Like say, near enough thing, gets around issue best can. Eh, there’s nowadays percent positive though. 

How many tests done? many hospital admissions there? many vaccinated? Probably even cases rise, you’re seeing large jump hospital admissions would year ago, likely positive tests gonna vaccinated people get sniffles day two got tested safe. don’t consider alarming, someone getting sniffles isn’t big deal, hospitals hitting breaking point is. now, there’s warning signs I’m aware point areas high vaccinations rates danger hospital capacity running out, that’s important thing. looked it, trustworthy independent studies raise confidence it? that’s Sturgeon General.  hundreds millions vaccinated people around globe. course going get it. Ooof, I’ve pal true. would really hard. Intentionally providing incorrect public health information obviously bad. prove intent? Sure someone promoting sort quack miracle cure whatever, Aunt Dottie shares FB post genuinely concerned, it'd create legal nightmare try stop. harassment mean? please provide link this? can’t believe people spread shit believe Probably told Heroin. problem lot places apparently immunity gap population susceptible serious infections they've exposed fewer virus particles normal last 18 months.

So wearing masks avoid flu RSV infections long term could mean become much deadly. One reasons influenza actually deadly humans much acquired immunity.

When Europeans first took Flu new world way way deadly native people covid now. Full virus structure, would pick specific strain, means mutations cause problems antibodies.

The spike protein, however, virus attaches cells. mutations protein would actually render virus less effective, though odd one will, course, go opposite. That's part spike protein targeted- stability crucial virus. less worry many mutations may occur already occurred higher chance dead ends virus.

In short, full virus gives broader spectrum mutations affect antibodies. today back Christmas levels, yay /s

I’m thinking Sinovac performance could possibly remain variants. It’s already evident Gamma/Lambda/Alpha. curious nobody study Sinovac vs Delta yet. 

However one thing agree Sinovac really suffers technology inferior mRNA vaccines. really want thank comment. condition makes higher risk many people don’t understand vaccine may protect differently. I’m study help figure well I’m protected end hospital odds quite bad. can’t risk catching find bad.  Depends going on. information changes everyday. Experts crystal ball. best go evidence. Changing opinion good they're using latest information. evidence changes change problem. Experts change mind. Thank clearly restating biggest reason everyone *can* get vaccination *should.* one said it’s absolutely true. 

At least said it’s safe conditions. I’m talking 12m old wearing mask 8 hours partially supervised. Im talking wearing 5 minutes mom pops Trader Joe’s constantly watching them. I'm sorry, must stressful. Get vaccine. protection. I've watching lot studies it. Moderna well studied Pfizer, similar. Moderna might perform slightly better anything. 

Studies find Pfizer 63-80% effective preventing infection altogether. infected, 70-75% less likely hospitalized. understand emotionally charged topic factually die rate 1/500k lower car lot children likely already got covid even know

If know something world please enlighten me. Vaccinated wearing mask indoors, part! (shhhhh) Staten Island.  Depends numbers concern you. majority breakthrough infections Israel asymptomatic. symptoms mild. Hospitalizations/deaths remain incredibly low tracks data already vaccines. even though many even luxury refuse vaccinated.

I think stretch. think find even strict regulations unvaccinated folks, going fair number holdouts.

These rules come effect one week, even record sign-ups, still seeing 935k people signing up.  Now, maybe that's limit available appointments, article mention it, doubt it.

So even without enough doses everyone, expect everyone chance get vaccinated. TBH that's usually strategy already since much patience waiting table February 2020. hard know big risk I'm taking still know little non-hospitalized outcomes vaccinated people get Delta. Good thought. me, seems saying twice likely admitted Delta Alpha.   wonder something simple mask could help prevent infections… nah, would simple  Well, research published JAMA month said might great older kids too, disagreement. public health decisions large groups people going arbitrary cut offs when. Obviously won’t every child, public health decisions individualized.  Sealioning?  guess kill people way. frequently new variants, that’s normal viruses. They’re usually nothing concerned about, especially you’re vaccinated. bet folks don’t even know lambda, iota, gamma, kappa, zeta variants exist since they’re big deal don’t make news. like prevent spreading GI viruses. least California, waitlists honestly joke. could easily get someone sign fulfilled essential function connected, given slot. either those, lots places end day calls otherwise destroy used due hesitancy, went two three days row, ability get jab pretty much there.

My inlaw able get March lived state populace outright vaccine, sign up, get jab, move on. easier me. talk people knew people. walked pharmacy got demand basically. 

The point is, never difficult get jab starting March determined enough. time expect China transparent? serious naivete there.   surprising, however unfortunate great vaccine. go time it’s busy start, like weekday afternoon, weekday nights Monday-Thursday 7PM?

That’s I’ve test waters avoiding times restaurants super crowded lunch dinner. also problem Singapore earlier year formed ward largest public hospital. reduced capacity tremendously least partially contributed us going lockdown prevent adding load healthcare system. Yes, UK that's vulnerable people vaccinated. That's proportions work.  Infected mainly young, death rate low. could looking 10s thousands long COVID brain fog - exactly want economic recovery. direct correlation Income, Education Progressive vs politics county county, city city, zipcode zipcode far seen watching stuff closely 15 months, comes vaccinated, much. 


I'm stupid know correlation = causation here, pretty damning. national dataset country nationalized healthcare data collection. PCR tests given symptomatic asymptomatic people.

You make good points, read conclusion paper, basically review article?

""The quality, quantity, durability protective immunity elicited natural infection SARS-CoV-2 poor relative much higher levels virus-neutralising antibodies cells induced vaccines currently administered globally.11, 12 Emergence variants SARS-CoV-2 variable escape natural vaccine-induced immunity complicates matters further.

Life terminal condition. One lowest vaccination rates country held world's leading producer vaccines. 
  don’t disagree this. time tell. hand, suspect US set deal Delta pretty well, compared many parts world. think actually blessing disguise hit hard initially first wave. First all, many people exposed infected, contribute herd immunity. Secondly, much country traumatized first wave demand vaccine pretty high. So, fairly significant portion population either covid vaccinated, both. Compare country like Australia. locked hard, still locked down. People got arrested walking dog, wearing masks. almost Covid all, tiny fraction population vaccinated. vulnerable delta right now. I’m sure won’t like India them, could really bad, given ZERO immunity! Last September, Australians gloating success, I’d much rather U.S. right now. agree actually worst region country. 

Covid bad last winter SW MO local health saying rates ticking (E MO), expected increase substantially well. 99.2(?)% cases people vaccinated think; that's close exact least...

Now done it? Apparently nothing...

At point state mask mandate (been way along), way (at least federally led) vaccination outreach communities need take place. top that, local health officials longer implement restrictions either. things helped St. Louis instance (mask mandates, occupancy restrictions, etc) earlier part pandemic (that state never did) longer possible before.

So you, region far enough away (I assume, example) suffer federal restrictions irresponsible behavior people here? know virus really issue - restrictions things like occupancy, masks travel ability really tailored area needed. used general method spread control point - unless/until general wide spread issue comes along.

If 70% people SW Missouri want roll dice Summer &amp; Fall covid - anything anyone it. sucks, fucking reality. least every one survives level immunity counting towards total. 

They may die may sick months/years, may go broke medical bills, may infect unfortunate person turn dies, may grind hospitals crawl, causing suffering would otherwise access care... unless want hold every one jab forcibly; thing done let happen hope cause new variant.

-

I myself, start careful go, see stay home till see plays out. least good numbers bit got go Museums fairly safely years hiatus...
Waiting months see goes seems prudent. case children, they'll hammered regardless. vaccines effective vs hospitalisation, weak heard immunity (60-70% protection vs R value 6 delta). seeing Delta spread even places like Israel/UK.

Kids gonna pay price.  Alwayshasbeen.jpg real head-scratcher... Without ages given least likely children protected even parents 100% board vaccines due ages.  World war covid ! Surely, might uptick hospitalisations deaths, probably come close last wave, already bad terms hospitalisations deaths. people get vaccinated, lower chance gets unvaccinated person gets infected. Even cases high, deaths hospitalisations get hand. group small among vulnerable. 1 dose enough protection hospitalisation death, even delta variant. elderly medically vulnerable given full dose wanted already anyways.

- ~68% total population vaccinated
- ~83% adults vaccinated
- Currently vaccinating remaining parts 12+ groups.
- ~90% (87%-94% multiple polls) adults wants vaccine
- ~70% teens (12-17) want vaccine.
- Around 1 dose per 100 people still given every day, around half first doses. still heading towards vaccination goals. current rate vaccination, we’ll seeing news stories like rest humanity. whole lot longer. cats get infected?   Exactly one profit constituents dying? logic escapes me. Yeah absolutely. dude obviously wasn’t focusing immune system whatever.

What exactly makes “some best data” compared backdrop large numbers studies found far higher levels protection? Danish study extremely short, mention measure cycle counts, symptoms, disease severity, time since previous infection, seropositivity, relevant useful data papers have. make mention median time “reinfection”, important [research found patterns consistent RNA actually causes recently infected person almost three times likely test positive PCR compared someone wasn’t recently infected, ratios such: 0 30 days, ratio 2.85. 31 60 days, 0.74, dropping 0.29 61 90 days, finally 0.10 90 days.

They cohort study, patients positive antibody test results initially likely positive NAAT results, consistent prolonged RNA shedding, became markedly less likely positive NAAT results time

I’ve linked several papers even more. curious Danish study apparently “some best data” given studies broke reinfections symptoms (consistently leading high protection symptomatic reinfection, lower asymptomatic), duration since previous infection, report cycle counts, etc. seen study short - entire full text Danish study fits one page - little way assess it’s methodology, shortcomings, etc. Oh, believe me.

  · Jul 14, 2021 must neighbors former coworker...  little prick, eat ;) Also odd, numbers non-fully vaccinated people going back 1/1/21 vaccinations roughly starting get significant numbers.

So included numbers basically meaningless presented. Would much useful look rate cases/hospitalization/deaths fully dosed cohort changed time. Short, good. call ""rare"". 


At least Delta variant spreading UK, we're seeing breakthrough infections 1 5 fully vaccinated patients. 


But risk hospitalised 95% lower vaccinated - i.e. vast majority breakthrough infections asymptomatic, mild. 


In short - vaccinated, infected scary. He’s done complete 180 beginning pandemic. Coward party. Exactly right?!? Nothing says I’ve got mine like boomer adult kids idea it’s like parent right cares old enough vaccinated. went saw hopefully next governor Joe Cunningham last night breath fresh air.  aren’t pandemic. kids aren’t vaccinated. need remember that. isn’t over. I’m wearing mask public child since she’s vaccinated shouldn’t go maskless. People still dying oxy. I’ve lost friends well. Almost lost myself.

You google exact info. yeah, war drugs failed pitifully. Decriminalize everything regulate it.

Also I’m former heroin addict uses weed lsd. quality life improved immensely never think using opiates I’ve trying pair. Try sending again.

It’s contingent upon lack FDA approval. appears something that’ll moot political calculation policy that’ll actually impact next term.   Sure. need learn articulate thoughts. people, possibly cancer patients chemotherapy may able take vaccine. immunocompromised people vaccine effective may need booster. What's point? Death rate illness somewhere around 0.5-1.5%. Death rate vaccine might high 0.0018%. That’s tremendous difference, equal difference 18 vs 5000. want wait out? That’s choice know chances much improved vaccine. misunderstanding math saying. It’s fully vaccinated people 1% chance dying COVID. It’s 1% cases deaths COVID people fully vaccinated. That’s considerably lower 1% chance dying you’re fully vaccinated. Yup! doctors killing covid ""covid hoax"" duh!! 🙄 white much ""pro-life,"" amiright?

There's end madness. 😣 Americans dumb btw upvotes left asked dad statistic it’s different he’s saying. doctor treats COVID patients involved vaccination. tweet data public. says would surprised says it’s true it’s probably dramatically reduced symptoms. Well don’t know you’re willing seems like people take LSD Psilocybin containing mushrooms get smell back astounding rates Thanks, Spock. ;) amazing well given low vaccination past vaccine hesitancy amazing got long way go. sorry children victimized parents, adults, thier vaccine/mask negligence. Vaccinated people much lower risk, risk. It’s still important vaccinated people avoid indoor crowds, wear masks, wash hands, etc. Coal mines? still impressive. people's body also react badly COVID, lol. Quebec *implying* this. there’s kind outbreak fall, unvaxxed shut nonessential places. 

Want bet ‘outbreak’ sorts? It’s plan I’m it. kind? Coal? Gold? Copper? salt?   started taking multivitamin pandemic started since spent way time indoors eating crappier food (more canned shelf stable stuff, especially last year) figured hurt.

Hell adults dont. least adults dont excuse. someone may tell child something, doesnt mean right. common sense look past first opinion let alone fight pressured. opinion, expirience this. Kids stupid shit, especially hormone filled teenagers.

Not kids like course realize that. number smart enough make siad mature decision far lower ones do. know they've drastically changed lifestyle since getting vaccinated? someone works children, absolutely clear child isn’t feeling well. kid long COVID going extremely apparent. Normal child behavior jumping around, running, playing. child lying around, fatigued, inactive, trouble breathing obvious anyone. ""Adult doses"" matter; total doses do. UK vaccinated anyone 18 yet. Consolation looks likely Pfizer might approved 6+ September. can't wait. Wow, certainly hope brings home idiots don’t get vaccinated.  US cases risen 50% week, approximately highest increase time pandemic. Project forward six weeks we've got serious problems. time there's nothing stop it, everyone thinks American lives matter already done getting vaccinated. 

It's super weird CDC public health leaders talking this, many non-public-health leaders best make happen.

There also reason optimistic, question. Huh untrue sure get info. today vaccines recieved fda approval yet still classified experimental. Emergency approval thing legally technically speaking. give source please? plausible, iff discussing ""recent"" deaths. seem quite high -- explainable population measured super small, super at-risk, both.

Example: article said 15 17 recent deaths Springfield vaccinated. could wrongly interpret ""12% vaccinated died"", actually 1 partially vaccinated last one ""unknown"". Plus super small sample size know details. types people still unvaccinated weren’t wearing first place, especially states like Mississippi rural Missouri hit really hard. way going now, way businesses police areas going enforce even did. end well them.  “Until kids vaccinated” never, ever going happen. third adults refuse vaccinated, number refuse let children vaccinated likely higher. woman work (in childcare funnily enough) got vaccinated husband furious blamed miscarriage it. lovely daughter definitely won’t vaccinated big enough drive clinic request one. Don’t worry, man…it’s good. Soooo many parents mentality “the kids likely die car accident!” many parents taking NBD approach think kids immune. It’s mind boggling. Hope ends soon.  purely logical standpoint, that's thing possibly incoherent people. Elders already spread genes, like ""big loss"" die infectious disease something else. agree sibling comment one instead kept kids home past school year, I'm sending back upcoming school year felt isolated. I'm still constantly debating best option is. Sadly good option. Luckily many people community gotten vaccinated cases finally low, weeks even 0 cases. can't wait kids vaccinated! going door door? Wtf Considering 33% adults vaccinated dumpster state, I’ll go no. peoples children going get obliterated come start school year. curious vaccine hesitancy outside USA. Maybe. grapple unvaccinated actually are. deaths coming mostly unvaccinated, think they'd want protect voters bit better know longer interval doses simply better. choice I'd wait three months. Meaning exactly? they’re going way request vaccine, despite parents objections, could say they’ve done research made mature decision. We'll never truly know. said, evidence strongly suggests locking would worse.

(They probably locked old people vulnerable COVID, instead everyone. would messy either way.) pandemic really made clear states never even think living in.  People gotta start calling health departments school boards get masks back elementary schools fall.

It's insane dropped almost everywhere. covidiots top agitating removal masks schools, rest us assumed schools would right thing. Fake vax cards.... real virus. science week element failed them. Wat Well, they’re vaccinated now. Sort of. Personally, I’d prefer shot arm. guy one sane ones pandemic. I'm hoping something bill allows required full FDA approval. vaccine saves lives… unvaccinated don’t. sub good awhile, reverted back doomerism. it’s “you still catch Covid vaccinated!” “the delta variant!”  Genius! true all. real reason accidental cross-contamination. Eh, give us 6 months. We’ll time. Agreed. seen discussion air traveling risky due destination transit itself.  real answer accident. wrong. vaccines received EUAs, stopped experimental. really asking kids fat?

So yeah, bad person. better. They’re literally planning going door door. Today Olivia Rodrigo speak try appeal Gen Z. I’ve Road tripping even states like WY SD ads radio billboards getting vaccinated. follow Joe Biden social media account CONSTANTLY posts it. It’s regularly TV. want do?

There’s level government action overcome people’s hate government.

Kantar poll found 29% respondents agreed Britain needed learn live COVID-19 without restrictions. person wearing protective face mask stands King's Cross Station, amid coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak London, Britain, July 12, 2021. Don’t look past “16 older” line, instead total population. wish would stop this. state percent based total population. No. worried, mask stay home. Let rest us live lives.  It’s still better nothing think. It’s basically saying wasn’t infected 4 days ago likely. pretty similar thoughts may close useless think it’s still better letting unvaccinated people without test. Pfizer ran trials too, something gloss over. cdc director. Went tv. Held mask says. better vaccine get. ridiculous. worked me. Bc made want get vaccine. pretty depressing country rich RoK less 30% fully vaccinated. get it. took son 2 weeks ahead birthday get shot traveling LA 12th birthday. super nervous decided get shot early. lie nurse birthdate several times got it. Surely wont backfire allow younger people infected since wont hospital. ""mean"" mean? easy current rate. Probably 25% antivaxxers already caught COVID well. worries even notice it. 1.5k everyone would covid pretty quick. think peak England much later that. I'd estimate around 1 August gradually decline.

A Delta wave steep left hand side long right hand tail I'd expect cases remain high much August.  mean beginning. Doubt though. Honestly dont think country found point origin would forthcoming data honestly. sooooooo close getting truth! (With first sentence)

It's going tough time pandemic, people feel little personal fear virus point, spreads faster almost one immune. Thanks telling us we've already known since Trump tried cover up. 

Now going year neglect? spread virus goes 5 times previous level, get unvaccinated old people infected 5X lower zero vaccination.

Are serious? 1.3 million new cases per day? really stretching here. I'm talking global new cases deaths, yeah localized waves vary well, though Texas pretty much mirrored global cases aside recent wave. India pretty big impact one last May whereas reported cases make look like one small long wave single huge wave. essentially 90 minute skit old Living Color show. classic. Apparently Delta R0 7 left roam freely. Meaning vaccines barriers. Totally agree — husband, example, truck driver.

They won’t let work. What’s problem? I’d rather risk life everyone else road. don’t need us. Plenty markets deal with. would surgeon suddenly expert infectious disease? Yes, get that, I'm advocating immediate reopening. I'm questioning actual _plan_ is, far even offered suggestion considered ""premature"". offered zero parameters way could consider ""high"" enough vaccination rates justify reopening.

As I've said, vaccination rates certainly going cover entire population, natural immunity, exit wave inevitable ever reopen border. Whether current leadership political backbone accept inevitable deaths remains seen.

The argument simply ratio cases hospitalisations/deaths significantly increased.

Another thing people consider, ever went military ship, quite close ventilation system, everyone packed either quarters/dorms/cafeteria tight corridors etc. guess virus load must high. boats meant maximise every inch. saying Fauci lied us.

Vaccinated people zero risk getting COVID (again, according science). matters many ""idiots"" get vaccinated. simply scientific reason wear mask.

Sounds like click-bait headline. 'this super antibody'? Something unrelated current vaccines have? keep mandating masks least another year.

It's simple thing absolutely everybody do.  Good luck putting kids daycare school without vaccinating them! Obligatory vaccines normal part everyday life France, current « outrage » overblown ridiculous Yeah, case levels ultra low province, lowest since March 2020, I'm week fully vaccinated. I'm going force live 100% normal life (within rules still effect) next week maybe move away checking news daily. risk really anymore. I'd love convince state. We've got like 45%. Thank much pointing this. heard corona kills black people support spread virus. government, authorities mainstream media may talking vaccine agenda vaccinate people also vaccine actually works. That's hilarious part. Sometimes obvious answer true one.

Having immunocompromised young family member,personally we're safe zone (barely)over 18.I think immunocompromised kids. stupid expressing hope. starting feel like coming woods good trajectory. many people, that's true vaccine awesome. 

But deal ""vaccine hesitant"" (I'm trying perpetuate us-vs-them thing blanket calling anti-vaxxers), wave cause take fall for. Plus, rest world vaccines still available really suffering. India world's largest vaccine producer. Since Spain moved SE Asia? French vaccination rate: 100% Sadly, might work It’s totally worthless stat. Everything said true top big January surge anybody vaccinated it’s really big percentage cases preceded vaccines. 

OTOH, vaccinated people skew older, covid dangerous older people. respect, statistic undercounts effectiveness vaccine. 

All factors controlled for. given stats like “93% reduction hospitalizations.” don’t know people need glom uncontrolled raw numbers like article. Make everyone miss school instead? one knows even Covid-19 results permanent damage. whole US it’s 10 times less deaths covid. overdoses contagious, decide shoot kill yourself, potentially hundreds people.
The comparison doesn’t make sense. every country infrastructure supply chain make supermarkets happen. wet markets exist necessary exist.

Ok really point here. Yeah makes sense - probably even Australia. I'm looking forward getting vaccinated soon can. someone think children?!

I wish rates higher, I'm avoid around certain friends vaccinated despite fully vaccinated, immunosuppressed vaccinated, I'm still immunosupressed, meaning vaccine efficacy likely lower me. Given immunosuppressant I'm taking, studies found 10-fold decrease antibody production vaccines, they're unsure much (if all) affects protection. So, given I'm high risk group *were* become infected, chance becoming infected despite vaccinated likely higher average person received vaccination, makes sense I'm taking steps ensure safety. Unfortunately, friends still think getting poked arm twice feeling sick *a single day* much inconvenience help protect others around them. perhaps believe conspiracy BS, either way, I'm going risk health see people care enough protecting others get vaccinated. surplus vaccines available, really valid reason (except rare medical issues) people avoiding vaccination.

Every country decided based models assumed vaccines prevent spread vaccinating eldest first always best. Every model assumed vaccines prevent spread concluded vaccinating most-likely-to-spread first would prevent deaths.

But right doses matter. matter many times less. thanks, interested. Stock N95 masks still breakthrough cases. us never once, “again” yet intend let COVID spread doses anything

See below, seems Day 2 record setting appointment numbers, would lead believe appointments still available. Otherwise would tapered due lack showing hard data replying semantics. Logic games place here.

Actually every place here. made statement ""Getting test massive disruption unvaccinated people, **even though many even luxury refuse vaccinated.**"" exists plausible scenario everyone chance get vaccinated even enough doses everyone. mean, shit, open everyone two months vaccination rates crawling along announcement.

We're three comments still insisting need 55M vaccines order public health policy based caring people chose what's best them

Uhh... define word ""caring"" policy seems much care people choose what's best need good push it. US policy vaccines care people choose best we're basically stuck slow crawl forcing instead convincing ineffective dangerous.

So read different articles then?

They set record number appointments. Clearly effective getting people get vaccinations. [This chart anyone needs see effective policy going breed antivaxers years come.

My honest opinion: so? go 2% 3% population. (True anti-vaxxer numbers. Like refuse MMR DTaP. COVID vaccine hesitant lazy busy go get done promptly) Big whoop. They're still insignificant portion since got separated society vaccinated, damage deal GREATLY reduced.

Additionally, underscoring entire thing nothing set stone. French government move October 3rd date. move July 21 date.  France gets point availability gap come October 3rd, pivot. bottom line is: going 10M doses short mean actually availability gap.

I, mean, shit, much gap gets covered saying ""If started vaccinations, cover PCR tests past October 3rd."" imgur link (from reddit post above) deleted, given various wait times including 11 weeks fully vaccinated following initiating AZ vaccine, I'm guessing policy change would cover big portion gap.  People that. would kid old enough pass. people need contrarian opinions order pursue knowledge.

Pretty much contrary opinions value come scientists themselves. 

The probability Joe Blow street revolutionary insight upend scientific expertise thousands smartest people world? Practically zero. 

Even Joe Blow accidentally right vaccines causing magnetism, gave us good reason believe opinion still worthless. studies dosage, safety efficacy finish September 12s Pfizer. Medical testing children delicate matter. best numbers vaccine protection severe cases really good - like 95% effective good. still means 20 unvaccinated people would position, 1 vaccinated person would. 
 
And see real world. example currently San Francisco Marin counties, hospitalizations covid 9 unvaxxed 2 vaxxed SF 13 unvaxxed 2 vaxxed Marin. 
  
 
Those kind numbers expect places high vaccination rates according efficacy percentages. shows vaccines really helpful, severe breakthrough cases super ""rare."" got vaccinated wanted good member community, look family, lastly keep healthy. still worry concern fellow citizens neighbours CAN'T get vaccinated.

With vaccination rates around 75 percent area, deaths did, still rising hospitalizations associated long term impacts. Like double lung transplants.

The vaccine working, risk me. raging asshole immediately stops giving shit second risk gone family. far pandemic even funny. Nothing scientific *seems* like unvaccinated able free ride vaccinated US Alpha variant case numbers went almost nothing, even people stopped masking. really seem like over.

Not case Delta *at all* seen countries far US unvaccinated communities getting rekt.  General Sturgeon. Inevitably say done research, something wro g research. Never mind fact us actuadoing research, reading people's research, that's different point. Well.. cafe me..

Regarding re-infection anomaly whereby first 2 months confirmed infection likely register 're-infection' rapidly tapers extremely low proportion people infected.

I wonder cousins situation true re-infection relapse?

The fact serious second time even makes wonder second disease indeed flu/some infection, test COVID still administered came positive given short interval. Australia handled pandemic well. They’ve squandered early lead end sight straight misinformation. Link study shows 38% drop efficacy re: hospitalizations. rough variants, they've found out. Good article NYT it, today.

Your/our risk getting covid19 increase still there's community transmission know delta especially good breakthrough infections

Fully vacinated still get covid19 symptoms, it'll likely serious require hospitalization death. ""mild"" symptoms like fatigue, loss taste smell etc

Basically, fully vacinated still higher risk others vaccinated transmitting freely still instead fight exposure week, high community transmission means fighting maybe daily multiple times day even 70% w/e protection, exposure means chances breakthrough Depends risk tolerance.

Trump got elected 2016. country fractured half country would rather believe obvious lies admit side might right.

When covid started health officials said unless something looking 250,000 dead end 2020. said no, looking 500,000 dead end 2020 people stupid, self centered arrogant right (wearing mask social distancing).  happened? People went beach. People went spring break. People insisted gathering large groups. Ok little bit, took Feb. 22nd 2021 hit 500,000 dead U.S.

It’s also understanding US stringent China, studies *in* China funded US firms precisely they’re lax. that’s case, that’s, well, fucked up. Medical pro terminated field. thoughts:

1) science principles Sputnik V excellent know suspicion results, given mechanism action, surprising. use two different adenoviruses dose J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine (10^(11) particles), one Adenovirus 26 strain J&amp;J uses Adenovirus 5, gets around issue first dose causing neutralizing antibodies block second. Based this, think reported efficacy likely realistic would willing take vaccine.

2) Russia engaged extensive antivaccine disinformation program since well COVID-19. recently, disinformation program aimed Western vaccines, J&amp;J/Janssen, BNT/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZenica/Oxford. maligned mRNA vaccines unsafe introduction genetic material cells (even though Adenovirus-vectored vaccines, including own, **actually introduce foreign DNA cell nucleus**). maligned AstraZenica ""Monkey vaccine using monkey virus."" know they've done J&amp;J/Janssen similar product. 

And chickens coming home roost.  Russian people trust vaccines, especially vaccines. wonder there’s data level immunocompromisation leads illness/death covid. mainly people cancer organ transplants? also getting people suppressants autoimmune diseases? know lot people keep saying think - thing nearly 18 months old, definitely appears vast majority people mild asymptomatic cases recover.  lies censored? Ireland vaccinating 25+ Friday. 18-25 after.

 option are;
Open everyone, inevitably close spikes among unvaccinated.
Open vaccinated - maybe get away close shop. case, business owners get revenue streams.
Keep everything closed - business owners get hit. 

Its perfect, logically better alternative. Russians Republicans share lot common traits. allowed the

 - wait - 

Patient Protection Affordable Care Act

Also known Obamacare

Which also problem with. I'm sure is. People like woman neck scarves (her name escaping me) really blame failings. people hamstringing every turn. new mom, working home, going school (phd student) feels forever never ending. start back person teaching 2 weeks. hope kinda starts decline. Frustrating say least state, widely seen leader pandemic, trouble counting. Glad unambiguously 70% eligible population though. Yeah looking places like Malta UK worried. 80% coverage isn’t preventing surges, will? Lockdowns supposed temporary measure vaccine rollout. crew berthing compartment ship idea close people live Gottleib saying 60-90 days wave work way vaccinated people vulnerable take precautions. I’m sure characterized “never”. It’s absolutely given worse variant happen though.

Don’t try make seem like it’s inevitable. That’s misinformation. Flags shirts advocating certain American politicians weirdly common well!  Vashon? That’s are. Possibly vaccinated ZIP code nation. really care one way another opiates legalized. really want argue legalization reason roll eyes somebody's interest politics revolves around legalization drugs nothing else. priority either way, be.  refuse provide sources info easily looked common knowledge, clear sign someone actually want proof. fair men women mostly young healthy. probably would low symptoms even unvaccinated.

Note - I’m vaccinated antivax bullshit president?

His brazen comments vaccine efficacy earlier want speak. penalize young cannot fully vaccinated yet? like world went lockdown young people. Kind weird give preferential treatment older people chance get fully vaccinated young people fill hospitals. Good luck finding solidarity younger generation new strain comes existence effective current vaccines. fucking perfect Check says:

- spread localized based vaccine rates, meaning risk depends live 

- vaccinated people vulnerable (older/health issues) take precautions live one local areas 

- expects shorter time wave work through, expects peak next 60-90 days

This seems entirely sensible reasonable. Again, vaccinated people ""zero"" risk. definitely get Covid. greatly reduces chances, well chances serious case, magic bullet. 

You're trafficking misinformation. problem, buddy. Sorry sound ignorant .. want get vaccine also trying get pregnant - know many saying nothing worry feel won’t know vaccine hasn’t around long enough long term effects discovered. opinion would suggest getting J&amp;J it’s one shot done getting 2 doses required safe/are better? fortunate work home still little social interaction. However big events coming delta variant making worried. 
Do think another wave another quarantine shutdowns state state? UK administered many AstraZeneca doses less effective new variants. Perhaps many UK patients received AZ vaccine? get vaccine immunize you? Thanks fam Bots trolls?   know one relatives. He's supposed great guy. wish optimism. live Florida. son 18 months. Pediatrician told us keep anywhere indoors again. nightmare again.  one. Lol oops. Dad’s*  [*Harlem fun movie. like saying *Spaceballs* racist. won’t undo progress vaccinated    Basically life changed (Florida). reported 7k cases today per CDC. I'm fully vaccinated son old enough. pediatrician told us go back mask wearing (we never stopped) also advised crowds, stores, ect. feel like life never return normal.  took Pfizer months (not years) bring production facilities ability produce mRNA vaccines. Many production facilities said could involved legal hurdles addressed, there's reason believe it'd take longer. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

We’re currently hitting record high cases+hospitalization+death daily. 
My family 9, eldest age 70 got first dose. Rest us didn’t even get date first dose. may view cruelty keep alive current condition. Sometimes family members can't accept reality put relatives should. say like it’s important distinction, COVID vaccination literally vaccine (currently) bill could possibly apply to.

If anything, minor distinction makes bill worse means automatically apply future pandemics serious enough require EUAs, preemptively hamstringing prevention. double us midwest.

Fosun/Biontech chinese manufactured vaccine can’t prone them. Perhaps skinnier ones proning outside unit. It’s good thing too. hate DeSantis cruise ship industry incredibly wasteful damaging.  Well J&amp;J gets people full immunity 2 weeks instead 8-9 weeks. get that.  least deadly - I’d lean likely deadly based India jury still out. way LESS deadly. Best case scenario deadly. people kids school home 18 months whose families wore masks protect communities, need communities protect kids vaccinated. mandate teachers staff vaccinated mask mandate kids &lt;12 brainer. we’ll end shut yet again. it’s worse. way that’ll bite us ass next time around. people say pandemic fully vaccinated get downvoted negative double digits? place protest China. think likely respond positively. J&amp;J would another choice vaccines use technology countries already have

To make mRNA factory would take years build. can't use old technology.  covid got vaccine. first shot worse symptoms second. looked way, body may know fight specific covid caught might best recognizing spike proteins. like practice body know serious threat, happened 2x vaccine, 3 times total immune system got exposed. wait 3 months infection though get vax anxiety disorder I’m far anxious possibility getting COVID wearing damn mask. 

It absolutely infuriated see people faking anxiety disorders try get mask mandates. look good Spain honeymoon both. pandemic tool ethnic cleansing geriatric euthanasia. still, children paying now. people charged child endangerment beyond me. Umm modern medicine based research done stem cells. might well refuse medication treatment developed prior 1980s hill wants die on. people say stuff like infant particles usually mean developed based stem cell research.

Not mention - J&amp;J vaccine also uses research general molecular biology manufacturing techniques …. It’s manufacturing lot complicated mRNA vaccines. is. change fact places like Russia can't give away vaccines despite like 30% vaccinated. remember saw article vaccine hesitancy across globe US surprisingly places like Australia even higher. 

I'm sure right supplies flowing lot better watch see, countries 2-3 years far worse vaccination rates US even NGOs shoving vaccine throats. Olivio Rodirigo went White House tell young people get vaccinated. trying hard   statement huge middle finger people like followed guidelines got vaxxed. Sorry CDC says vaxxed people need mask distance there's need. Mind also recommend beef cooked well done even though medium rare stake safe eat often not.
But whatever let's scrap freedom choice altogether lockdown forever I'm certain downsides all. /s  I'm saying easy. understand make difficult choices. want position. knew Delta variant already numbers England Portugal skyhigh. Apart initial outbreak, China absolutely crashed pandemic. talking about? See love net comments like put smile face completely true, deaths immunocompromized individuals. okay way prevent hospitalizations point ain’t sit home wear 3 masks 

you need regularly diet exercise want stop covid hospitalization. won’t prevent vaccinated hospitalizations, get it’s like random act god like 1% 

there 200k cases tuberculosis US last year think that’s need start estimating covid hold networks like Fox accountable. Period. friends moving Rotterdam envious. looks like real shit show past two weeks jesus. Lol, long don’t deal Apophis get plan got Germany wearing mask? world Stasi could dream of. include political / religious affiliation passes? want safe Covid, want safe people think like me.  Whats rates flying vs. driving Caribbean cruises launching US?

I imagine drivers noninsignificant portion cruisers. education America also urgent threat yet president allows formal sit leader country mostly responsible disinformation campaign. soft Russia? They’re barely superpower, treating codling Putin giving huge screen time pointless summits. anti vaxxers = dumb  didn’t say number - said “enough.” Clearly that’s PM saying.

Or another way plan reopen outside vaccination? wanted people get vaccine aight vaccine stop people transmitting virus? ""At least"" one dose. 1 less 21 days post 1st dose, 44 21 days post 1st dose, 118 2nd dose, 92 unvaccinated 2 unkown status. festival organized outdoors, rain 2 hours festival people flocked two tent-covered areas became ridiculously crowded.  Fuck know. would say we're likely heading masks recommended indoors that...

I even really opinion point. infections... Sorry meant people living lives “normally” outside snap lockdowns. knew state border closings. fun dump antivaxxers, government going make vaccines mandatory, else done? great tourism industry.  fine. [Derek Lowe gave roundup mRNA vaccine manufacturing months patents holding things back. cutting edge manufacturing places right (though expanding). Knowing something patent mean machines raw materials needed actually make thing. Also, often lot implicit knowledge available unless actually try it, i.e., part process get screwy X first like (and knowledge gets passed around within staff manufacturing facility, someone else trying first time figure while). mother immunocompromised child, yes was. depressed person, yes was. 

But it’s stupid question didn’t efficiently use lockdown didn’t real productive lockdown anyway. 

And don’t need full lockdown forever. lockdown lasting long direct result states even counties refusing participate enforce politics. wasn’t real lockdown resulting months literally that. means hasn’t happened. keep waiting household pets become vectors want absolutely zero evidence happening now. pets worried us giving them, like tigers Bronx Zoo getting infected presymptomatic keeper.   Hence word ""expand"". yes todays packed conservative court would probably fail ways around too. bunch restrictions lifted together curfew, doesn’t prove anything That's thought, masks. saw ""Oh vaccinated need wear mask...but kids should."" thought wtf do? kids still going get it. since mask mandates relaxed Pa, I've seen people bringing kids (all maskless) grocery stores. completely fucked. People went ""oh I'm vaccinated, gone now. Come kids.""

Edit: went ""If wear mask people think I'm vaccinated whatever want now."" busy making sure math racist lol Plot thickens . going put excess vaccines? Imagine vaccinated, symptoms ~~might be~~ severe. read previously understood individual exposed virus, average *for example* 95% chance develop symptoms whatsoever. need re-rolled every exposure, react exposure viral load time. sentiment correct though - nearly everyone recieves level protection get vaccinated. guy clue talking about. N95s shown pretty effective preventing infection. still wear one places think transmission high (airports, etc) even though social things friends since vaccinated. Correction: people mask around older people. Individual-based societies US seem refuse acknowledge mask communal tool works everyone close everyone using it. person wearing mask infected outgoing breath blocked, people less likely affected it. get 10% whatever number may got mask, mask stop much it. still get infected via eyes.

So one person wearing mask alone much use. Might actually dangerous single person think they're protected spend time crowds indoors. see old person masked up, person safer it, keep distance dont interact unless needed - unless masked. wish government would ban people like participating society. I'm jealous! add things vaccine pass, like political religious affiliation? Yeah seems growth stopped somewhat knows past weekend bring next week. guess use percentages hospitalisations absolute numbers insignificant. Yes spread hospital, actually sounds like two hospitals? None protection? wearing none?   Per article, 75% Blacks 18-44 unvaccinated, compared 50% White Latino, 17% Asians.

 numbers nuts. ? Children extremely low risk covid. article misleading. One facts one needs think bit understand! fact calling covid 1 says lot...

But know EXACTLY ADE happened SARS trials guided future research efforts creation vaccines. no, cause effect.

Also, pretty sure mRNA vaccines trialing SARS. 

What solution use vaccines like literally every virus develop one for? 

Please, go educate stop spreading misinformation fear. good place thoughts exactly. They’ve recovered it. Also Democrats waited certain in-person primaries start believing science. 


A poll worker Illinois died COVID working election. primaries conducted way align CDC recommendations time. Yeah, getting vaccine world take much time busy schedule I'm sure. Guess won't, since numbers stopped going weekend. Yea pretty great vaccine rollout . topic here?  China never transparent never be. create burner this, needed vent. 

I know people say anti-vaxxers ""selfish"" swear wife kind, thoughtful, sweet woman I've met wife. Everyone around loves her, nice everyone amazing person. 

However, *is* anti-vaxxer believes bunch half-baked conspiracy theories absolutely maddening. started years ago side family would spend hours hours Youtube watching videos thinking uncovered huge conspiracy. What's crazy sisters married men like-minded feel like huge outcast family share views (and many religious views well). least two nieces side completely unvaccinated since birth find insane, children, say anything it.

I fully vaxxed (Pfizer) three months ago. hoped saw issues, may change mind, done pivot long-term effects know be. even works school system works closely special needs children enough get change mind infuriates me. fact, told school system requires get vaccinated, immediately quit. poor, middle-class come quitting job could potentially devastating.

We four children two boys (15 13) eligible get vaccinated. torn past months, terribly concerned society whole. I've tried bring always turns huge argument. 

Well finally decided last night cannot control does, sons getting vaccinated. Believe me, I've tried ""ask her"" approach many times got shot down, flat-out told today taking get done whether agrees not. course, started all-out war house. 

She saying cannot without consent legally threatening call cops CPS it, stated, ""I think one would trouble me."" set more. acting like sort deal-breaker almost 20-year relationship. I'm pretty sure angry mean it, insane *this* things could end marriage.

Is right though? get trouble take without consent? wrong take get vaccinated without consent? feel terrible entire situation, really clue else handle point.  nurse acquired outbreak, necessarily work all, household contact also testing positive.

You need PPE 24/7. government made huge mistake (one many) telling people stop using them. gross think about. Like nobody cleaned themselves? still know people refuse get vaccine also let mail sit week open keep groceries garage still say premature. Many people get infected spread nobody, spread disease many, many others - we've known year point. changes, think know yet. troll posting data? They’ll say popped *only* vaccines approved find out. Like clockwork. It’s beyond stressful incredibly frustrating. course concerns catching covid, also concerns impact these, long term, restrict mental, emotional, social development. It’s win situation. I’m sure it’s feasible live, take full advantage outdoor world promote sense normalcy. I’m praying heart schools stay open eventually became rough them, honestly next stage going suck regardless. one thing everyone restrictions used line “this something protect people old sick getting virus,” “I adults whatever want, still adults don’t want get vaccinated.” claim things said authority lies, paranoia ""everyone else knows"" reinforce case.

To equate individual authority figures lied individual examples throughout history lies, part problem. reiterate seek help good. Go sea lion elsewhere disingenuous troll average delay signing 1st shot appointment dramatically increased 7 days 18.

Relevance? 935k people signing up, getting shots. centers poor suburbs Paris restrict could come

Past tense? situation ongoing? enough them, **even if** 100% eligible population wants get vaccinated.

Even if? Uhh... that's really statement since that's maximum amount people could vaccinated. If, say, 75% want one, everyone chance get doses everyone no, everyone chance get vaccinated.

No. False. additional ""if less X number people choose get vaccinated"" qualifier need. 

If bring home dozen donuts 15 people say ""Don't get second everyone chance first,"" I'm sure envision scenario someone gets 2nd donut. got vaccinated I'm afraid I'm afraid COVID (both really low), I'd guess can't argue phrases true. Neither means, face, dangerous, true. US. Good question  Tedros shot credibility load. wonder much ""grant"" money China stuffed guys pockets. much propaganda man, least go vaccine don’t worry awful world anymore. Imagine guy would pay lawyer amount money present case Supreme Court doesn’t wear mask. 

I get *may* clinical anxiety, takes many flights al world level anxiety can’t wear mask 😂 feel you. It’s incredibly isolating frustrating us young children—particularly babies time. Every time start get hopeful things go shit again. 

I’m midwife worked entire time kids high rate vaccine refusal/hesitancy community serve. completely understand pregnant people might want get vaccinated, it’s risk I’m willing take especially since unmasked laboring. may rethink career long-term, home birthing crowd generally vaccine hesitant, particular one.  course didn’t pull mRNA tech asses, (like said) we’re applying novel situation. completely agree.

For amount downvotes I’m collecting I’d expect see people disagree me. It’s almost like people don’t like tone something trivial like that. specialists go court argue someone die? don’t remember happening US. amount times somebody say ""Well know true not, research"" justifying sharing obviously false information Facebook staggering. can't even call think they're right thing sharing alternate viewpoints basis reality. think lot people washing hands regularly, hunch insignificant number people started washing much went soap way faster. watched husband wash hands every hour hour, even leave apartment, months. soap went much faster washing using restroom handling food. confirm cafeteria trained upon time! closed (the cafeteria, space know mean). Staff go eat lunch, sometimes functions lunchtime events held too. subs like that, I’ve learned quoting/pasting *entire linked article* response *usually* stops sealioning. burying multiple links disproving claims. 

Their response point 1) mock sources, 2) attack personally. end making look even foolish. 

Oh, report them. Always.  Hmm, I'm pro-mask anyone, make wonder good idea keep post-pandemic. mean you’ve provided argument. I’m saying people spreading misinformation morons. don’t care believe education zero standing do. Reason point I’m going listen data papers read, professionals position understand data even me. 

I’m going follow moron spreads constant misinformation sketchy sites, Facebook, rumble videos on. 


The vaccines killing people droves years

The vaccine doesn’t microchips

The vaccine doesn’t cause infertility 

The vaccine wasn’t rushed

The vaccine didn’t kill every mouse animal study

Or sometimes argument animal study skipped 

None arguments good faith help science evolve. lies damage everything. people spread they’re idiots He’s champion empty gestures protect reputation later criticism. best numbers vaccine protection severe cases really good - like 95% effective good. still means 20 unvaccinated people would position, 1 vaccinated person would. 
 
And see real world. example currently San Francisco Marin counties, hospitalizations covid 9 unvaxxed 2 vaxxed SF 13 unvaxxed 2 vaxxed Marin. 
  
 
Those kind numbers expect places high vaccination rates according efficacy percentages. shows vaccines really helpful, severe breakthrough cases super ""rare."" Y’all seen case numbers Florida? 📈 Washing hands, general, good. Forcing people use hand sanitizer employee watches....maybe effective thing store could (it's policy store frequent, even sanitized hands elsewhere). accidently drop bag fentanyl drugs many times move different table. problem (in opinion) provide equal time people ""scientifically"" think opposite reality. already give enough time climate change deniers is, mandated law someone sort evidence think disproves climate change give equal time...yikes.  guess thought incomplete -- Pfizer Moderna thing want sufficient time necessary. clinical trials seem require time get dosage right kids anything else makes sense.

However, CDC releases [unhelpful ignores reality many states going accommodate mask use, physical distancing, installing new air conditioning, testing, allowing online schools. feel like CDC makes ""suggestions"" ""recommendations"" practical value 2021 America. realistic document would be, ""what send kindergartener school teacher ridicules front peers wearing mask"", ""safety steps teach children forced unmasked PE close quarters kids poorly ventilated gymnasiums"", ""what kids intentionally cough parents COVID deniers.""  Ouch AZ really massive issues ramping production vaccine. fully understand Thailand might impose export restrictions, surrounding countries need doses well. supposed prosecute CDC? MI MOM talking same. Worried kids becoming long haulers. Bummed held back last year thinking would over, vaccines can't come day soon!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* article. Hospitalizations aren’t metric either.

Long COVID, organ issues, lung scarring, heart damage, etc. metrics consider unvaccinated children. Wow!! extremely wrong absolutely insulting. dont willing enough actually hear truth refrain. can't wrong. Delta variant stop increasing. 

In 3 weeks US 100k imho. 

It increases every country. 

And take UK numbers extrapolate countries. 

The UK great vacination rate. Espescially vulnurable demographics. distinction right politically. Brain worms    son graduated highschool! could get ugly. know going take people wake up. Sad It’s weird. Apparently freedom isn’t important need KingTubby tell mainstream media poisoned mind. private message can’t get downvotes. depends part US. Northeast West Coast like braindead southern states. arguing actually, accepting u/Eurovision2006 said.

If government introduces measure people still waiting first dose registering fair France either. Ain't prohibition grand?   Local government seriously constrains supply housing zoning laws. changed laws, could build enough housing meet demand start lower cost rent. questions long term effects 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30 years

Goal posts moved. RSV joke. can’t imagine baby COVID.

My (now 7 year old) preemie/110 day NICU son caught RSV right turned 1, despite us implementing near-COVID level household quarantine advice doctor. put son hospital 8 days, 3 PICU close ventilator, caused pneumonia well. Wouldn’t wish parent nightmare worst enemy. 

That experience makes one take COVID seriously. Can’t wait get vax sleep little better…  true? Vaccinated, yes. Masked, no. Kids still developing socially normal school experiences. use mask 10 years take 4 shots year, one progesterone. Good luck Arkansas passed law blocking mask mandates without legislative approval. pissed governor ordered one (ignored most) last year. Schools recommend wearing mask unvaccinated, Delta variant surging.  sucks there's collateral damage ignorant selfish attitude, that's shit goes life human history.

He literally said Fantastic insight.

We put solution right DARE drug campaigns failed. comment political, factual status vaccine technically experimental. Lots posts thread pure politics. bias showing. outregeous number people still minority people still definitely involved factor. people left sub ones worried covid, almost everyone else left moved lives is? Please share article: ""More 5,000 anti-vaccine protesters, waving...wooden crosses.""

Well keep Corona Vampires away! I'm sure that's grandma said polio vaccine, MMR DTAP. /s 

People age know better. still remember people getting polio, measles dying able walk. Vaccines work. 

The child mortality rate United States, children age five, 462.9 deaths per thousand births 1800. means every thousand babies born 1800, **over 46 percent make fifth birthday**. Vaccines reason half us die childhood. Well problem places come back, least US, mostly run people definitely won’t bring back sort restrictions again. Sadly, lives cheap expendable, especially lower class ones, people well. guess group people gotten hit hardest pandemic are… guessed it, lower class. matter! Every vote represents feel matters. Win lose said stand for! though? That's way beyond control. government going care. wife gave birth probably 2 months prior March last year pandemic got ‘real’ you’re much better place hang there. visiting family Northern Clark County Washington. Trust lot 30 percent here. They'll blamed push vaccine harder unvaccinated anti-vax people. got work. understand 0-17 breakdowns, overlap? Arizonans here? What’s COVID situation like general vibe regarding masks restrictions? Heading back college next month want prepared.  Seriously? specific issue w Dr Sergio Segara, Chief Medical Officer, generally distrust doctors? SIL daughter 11 said nobody asked age verification older kids 19, 17 14. seriously considering getting youngest vaccinated 12th birthday later year. Certain states US lower uptake others. also large POC populations. I'd curious tracking numbers based ethnicity. 

If necessarily care certain group people get shot, there's huge incentive convince them, make convenient so.  understand it, demonstrating *mandatory* vaccinations, vaccinations general. probably rabid anti-vaxxers anyway, still, small difference. Outdoors year round? Wow must live warm place. beauty Florida it’s full demographic cruises. driving port saves lots cash. One thing find ironic anti vaxxers claim enough data vaccine claim safe. However, whenever actually enough data covids effect body years infection, they're willing risk freedoms whatever.  many times would read ""if vaccinated Delta variant concern you"" took advice? Yes would go wedding state, would sit next someone vaccinated without mask, give second thought I'm vaccinated. chances winding hospital covid low chances winding hospital dancing wedding.   Yes, Gladys lock early enough, they're probably going wait September properly reopen. objectively false. Exponents work like even hospitalizations confirmed cases perfectly linked. Secondly, high enough percentage vaccinations (~70%) level efficacy preventing worst infections reduce amount eventually get hospitalized. UK's top public health officials watching hospitalizations closely still planning reducing restrictions. ascribe racism adequately explained stupidity. Please Netherlands, holland part Netherlands.

Edit yes fucked big time here! protocol going crop - should. considering many vaccinated people complaining prospect go back masks, I'm sure many also complain get tested vaccinated. Yeah. I'm scared. I'm teacher I'm going engaging 150 kids daily basis starting 3 weeks now. Zero risk? No. Even optimistic pronouncements, CDC say vaccinated *highly* protected. never claim *total* protection. Breakthrough infections real, although appears mild asymptomatic, data-gathering still early days.  That's static number, reflect places high number unvaccinated people infecting vaccinated individuals. We're going see breakthrough deaths fall, number going climb. guys get hired writing Scientific Piece know fact check understand controlled experiment actually works.  So, kicks, run numbers many people would die even 1% global vaccinated population succumbs it. That's pretty huge number. understand people minimizing patting back. 

In Mississippi last month, 12% hospitalizations 7% deaths fully vaccinated individuals. That's front end Delta surge, I'm sure number even higher, people dying home COD attributed something else. going get worse, especially see vaccine immunity wearing time another variant. kids go back school vaccinated people stop wearing masks think they're fine, curve going get ugly. seem likely. were, would mutations lot death past two years I'm sure weren't.  Yes, there's much spread SF, even unvaccinated people pretty safe. mostly like entire pandemic, big spike winter. It’s impossible misinformation main source news majority people experience isn’t exactly 100% honest.  excellent comment. sad.  Absolutely. fully vaccinated daughter not, course important cautious. worry, vaccine coming daughter. fairness, think important daughter right masked—until vaccine arrives her... whenever is. Thx, shave face lol

These semi rigid Honeywell masks. Didn’t go twitch too? hope works. need kids start wanting vaccine.  words vaccinated people need worry going back old habits right now? hope so. would hate us keep going backwards making good progress. never unlinked, ratio hospitalizations cases far lower thanks 93% 50+ fully vaccinated.

That said, fewer cases always better. Hopefully peak comes soon. smart. Even though people complain things like this. wanted jump say team Midwifes help us throughout pregnancy major hospital. absolute best!

We similar feelings home pregnancy\birthing center crowd. lucky find great bunch midwifes hospital. Yep backtrack. changed 12 weeks up. Lol vaccinated 27% pupulations antivax brought vaccination campaign stand still. Believe not, places worse us

I see light end tunnel country, unless govermenr mandates vaccinations might cause revolt.  Different variants? didn’t say would nightmare. said cases grow September vaccinated people protected. 

He’s probably right, way predicting sort catastrophic outcome. now? It’s new.  It’s hopeless.

This correct. fact, grossly irresponsible write this.

You idea long-term consequences could be, even mild case.

And know long vaccine effective.

Also, new variants showing every months.

Plus, someone could get mild asymptomatic case covid light viral load, get heavier load far worse symptoms. elderly immune compromised careful too. dumbest people knew high school went become nurses. thought maybe they'd pulled together academically since leaving HS, serious doubts that. pandemic quite enlightening regard. Thank you

Yes, know overreacting. back argument whether vaccines make magnetic lol damn joke  spend $9B/year incompetence.  Yeah, that's things getting much better there. Federal money. hate people, man. see lot people spewing disinformation contracting covid thanks vaccine.

The vaccines able stop amount infections, disinfo. vaccines cannot stop every single infection sign vaccines cannot stop infections. 

Here's example: known day one vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, also proof vaccinations help ward symptomatic asymptomatic infections. I'm sure fact upsets many people. We'd find way coronavirus general population tested 100% people well.

“The immune system works” gross oversimplification often used anti-vaxers, literally caused significant amounts suffering death. need learn flippant things. think we’re aligned thinking.

We also need accept may never know considering CCP refuses share anything helpful on-going investigation.

It’ll interesting see intelligence community comes - feel like month ago Biden gave 90 days.

My thinking scientists took lazy way initially, 2/3s viruses zoonotic origin - morphed “most likely” sound bite “this happened” narrative shouldn’t of. Already Covid September , fully vaccinated May, covid 2nd time. still worse normal cold. I'm curious see feel like couple weeks tightness chest 6 months. OrangeManBad.

Media told me.

OrangeManBad. wondering thing. know subset adult population can't get vaccine sort health reason small. mostly andbody vaccinated would igonore fight restrictions Correct. R value 1 result 100% infection. TRANSCRIPT!!!!

We read memo, that's (another reason) wanted out, fellas  Would even possible though? I'd argue lockdown still useful tool make sure people get chance vaccinated, see point beyond that.

Though, worth mentioning everyone wants vaccine chance. US, could said adults, children 12 can't vaccinated yet, that's lot people.

It's pointless thought experiment.  oh means even go Germany shop eat...  really hate sub thinks vaccines exist increase cases never equal increase hospitalizations death. Sure 1 1 still...  friends Indonesia dead COVID. Friends India dead COVID. 50, 40.

You don’t know you’re talking about, live bubble. 600K Americans dead lock down. Without lockdown it’s likely 2-3M. delta variant 3x easily spread first one, first one 5x spreadable flu. young people Brazil, India, Indonesia getting hospitalized dying new variants.

No one saying live fear. don’t wear mask anymore. get fucking shot. 99% protection dying, 90% hospitalization. Cringe. Kill cancer cancer right, unfortunate.

It's changed thinking lockdowns/restrictions. herd immunity possible vaccines argue worth using restrictions delay cases. herd immunity possible everyone possible opportunity vaccinated. there's much point left delaying inevitable. says premature rule lab leak theory. (Undermining report (article's words) lab leak theory unlikely). using words ""not impossible"". qualifying statements (he might leaning towards unlikely probability leaning towards likely - simply information this) except experience lab incidents fairly common.

He certainly playing words here, ""probable unlikely"" vs ""impossible"". classic case reading article, ignoring contents coming confirmation one's bias.

 says personally knows cases severe stomach died


This dude either knows millions people, hes counting things reads twitter ""personally knowing"" hes lying. read story morning Alabama mom whose kid hospital Covid, fighting life. Mom refused get vaxxed (or kid vaxxed) heard Covid flu. wishing made different choice wonders whether daughter survive. medical advice given video, simply summery going research Delta's wild reproduction rate estimated 5 8. important keep mind we're actually quite lucky spread around 1.5 restrictions lifted. scary imagine would happen vaccines moment.

Flu estimated 1.3 reproduction rate one week 2018 around 5000 hospital admissions UK flu worse current hospitalizations COVID. course, COVID-19 worse flu, shows good we're actually tough opponent. Malta rolled back welcome mat foreign visitors allow people eu uk vaccination certificates. Americans/Canadians etc sol say first time? That's still numbers Given enough time, virus could infect every person ship vaccination, fact 3% got infected within expectations.

Given enough time, virus could infect everyone entire world. put R value population earth. ""obvious"" bill null void soon gets approval. bill also take effect October - schools still require fall enrollment August/September... know replaced. directed old guy.  yes! keeps base happy saying he's banning mandate - mandate take effect October schools (like CSU) still mandate fall enrollment. mandate also disappears soon gets FDA approval. sympathetic towards parents children can't get vaccinated yet. keep wearing mask sake. mean, delusion one way go life. relative mine spreading word taking Astrazeneca make bleed safe vaccine. says personally knows cases severe stomach bleeding vaccine died. frightened elders family took first dose want ditch second one.

Does anyone information this? I've found articles blood clotting appears low risk. Uhhhh, guy job since January. Former Guy's administration Surgeon General, Jerome somebody-or-other. Maybe direct complaints him. Yeah got almost sleep yesterday waking fever bit unsusual me. checked I'm exactly day 10 receiving first shot. pandemic got vaccinated, country/state high vaccination rates. individual risk much lower, yes, local situation may better, *is over.*

This saying need continue lock away wear mask forever. fully vaccinated, protected going get, get life back.

This asking people remember there's world West. least pretend care. Fabulous 😑  LOL! Good luck that.

[department health ends vaccine outreach adolescents Listen, coming someone harshly judged people weddings last year (and skipped sibling’s 100+ person indoor December wedding), don’t think there’s anything wrong going ahead point. 

One caveat: wouldn’t attend October wedding yet unless kiddo home vaccinated beforehand. would reason, I’m cautious most. 

I’d guess maybe you’d hesitant people October would think vast vast majority would attend excited celebrate you. Yes, since that's bad news that's one media everybody talks 10x data UK, Canada, Singapore combined, showed much better vaccine efficacy, making Israel data look like outlier. also odd Israel's data showed identical 64% reduction overall infections symptomatic disease every piece data I've seen published vaccine variant shown greater efficacy symptomatic disease overall infections.  I'd say speaks volumes importance efficacy vaccines

Absolutely! fact minor symptoms great news proof vaccines effectiveness importance. said, sure looking like regular covid vaccine boosters going part life on, better hope vaccinated people developing long covid, source virus going away time soon. classic Mike DeWine 5D chess; mad first see genius seems still 2020. 
Have ever gotten anything right Yeah, understood wrong way. change spirit tho: vaccines work well. aware, loss hospital medical capacity serious.

Because severely limits number positive covid patients could treated. outbreak tolerance drops massively. means public health measures need go much higher. think misinformation spreading intentional. trolling, trying get traffic site, willfully looking spread dissension amongst public. ever end? Germany EU States already talk upcoming fourth wave, Delta Variant. European Countries already fourth wave. 
But deaths unusually low, since elderly mostly vaccinated already, that's something.. 
All sucks hard. hopped weeklong Caribbean cruise NYC once. think you’re generally right. Florida remains economically suicidal like this, could see pivot PR. 600k dead Covid US already imagine would without lockdowns   Russians don’t trust country’s institutions far could throw them, bitter experience. Odd. thought everyone least knew people AMAs. Guess not. He’s well-known, wrote virology textbook, etc. understand you’re saying even one dose offers significant protection. That's true. test positive immediately exposure. they’ve vaccinated enough people. probably research this. “Doesn’t really protect…”

Some benefit world delta means fuck all. Get vaxed OMG, 12 weeks!! sound good considering delta variant infections rise. Hope minimize interval Norway soon.  people call ""long-term effects"" medical intervention effects pop years years road. emerge much shorter time scale (more like 6 weeks - 2 months) persist on. damage important, probably never recover fully.  Primarily already natural immunity I'm particularly interested supporting pharmaceutical industry. generous interpretation he's naive enough really expect action, least putting position there's nothing else do. So, what's misleading it?

You opened that, go topic something else that's relevant article. saying anything antibodies meaning protection? comparing vaccines? saying better vaccines?

The general immunology knowledge high level antibodies, especially binds virus, confer good immunity level. Otherwise, previous knowledge immunity would useless point measuring antibody level, ever. bolstered knowledge immune system works proven otherwise.

This study even stronger since tested binding antibodies variants, level.

Discounting scientific report backing going topic harmful original intent article. ship remote island Maybe CDC considered effects telling noble lies. misinformation absolutely big problem definitely don’t *deserve* current situation, ask it. imagine thing could make worse pretend never wrong source problem bunch yokels Team Red. would never stupid though… Yep, sub enacted “30-day rule” karma baseline new accounts awhile back, helped awhile. It’s bypassed bought/sold/disposable/alt accounts. 

If check comment histories, they’ve either never commented recently, abnormally low karma, and/or participate heavily low-moderation subs like NNN conspiracy. Glad someone like charge! we’re going politics delineator, education may bet smoking gun. example, people often say college voters tend liberal/progressive, truth split usually closer 45-55 40-60 (R-D). I’d look exact numbers. 

Same income. fact high income (100k+) usually skews conservative. 

Now whether vaccine uptake political ideology party affiliation another story, I’m willing say it’s pretty safe bet is. education income least. (But argue whether education income alter likely someone affiliated X party, etc, it’s bit chicken egg).

I’d wager it’s one thing alone. know many die hard Trump conservatives vaccinated, many “progressives” larger cities aren’t (usually people alternative medicine, fwiw). Far defend Fox News OANN whatever, station clearly puts they're ""for entertainment purposes"" would handle this? Clearly prosecute TV drama comedy putting information might medically correct, could apply different standard? compromise might requiring drop term ""News"" network name, I'm sure that'd really change much practicality. mRNA technology least ten years data behind data extensive. Applying SARS-CoV-2 ""novel"" part vaccine, technology. regard similarly research dating back OG SARS MERS. [Our goes greater detail. don’t want vaccine? reason masks work restrict air flow. They're filters. air flow restrictors. mask adequately restrict air flow purposes COVID going create resistance tiny lungs infants toddlers cope with. slowly suffocate. basic flow mechanics. really something beyond capability understand?  year ago feeling horrible nearly fifty years old never helping raise children married.

Now like God send.

I happy totally lone room now. wish HIV COPD else would something help, even know parents run errands for. can't imagine pressure dealing now. 

If y'all know parents trying make working hard try help em bit please. although person’s comment mild, long storied post history hardcore sweden hate bizarre conspiracy theories alongside blatant misinformation (if didn’t already know). wasn’t comment made good faith neither others make. actual reason people getting vaccinated: PAY covid tests. 

the M.O. unvaccinated been: going out, get free test, update covid pass. set. longer option multiple tests add big time 1x week something. cheaper get vaccinated. Also visit New Orleans, it’s 2 1 vacation.  also leave Galveston Mobile. high risk then.

Which literally never worked. Remember care gives even let family visit? still kept outbreaks?

Not mention entire premise ""only infirm die"" also BS.  Good question, think articles might explain bit better could. 

Here’s quote “If vaccine found efficacy rate 70%, means individual vaccinated person exposed virus, 70% less likelihood developing symptoms.” quote different article One common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.” best math feel free correct I’m conflating incidence exposure individuals. think main point want make vaccines effective everybody, don’t “not work” 5% people whatever number may vaccine.  level odd rivals Major League Baseball coachs wearing uniform... anything makes distrust more... ""who's dork playing sailor?"" policy hospitals: mandate rare exemptions certain medical conditions. They're sickest vulnerable patients concentrated. consequences outbreak rather dire places. Negligence politically motivated malice? understand we're coddling anti-vaxxers point.

Couldn't agree more.

Re: fines, interesting. you?

In UK see people simply paying fines. would wear like badge honour. mean hairdressers opening lockdown, copping £10k fines like they're going fashion. Anti-vaxxers would lap here. 

There's also way parliament would pass law imprisoning it. make proof vaccination mandatory, still going clubs, bars, restaurants, stores outlets serve vaccinated.

Totally agree. Think found Israel iirc. Yes would nice, it’s FDA approved yet. is, schools employers right require vaccination condition. Hopefully approval happens year early next. Seen comment blaming Obama hour ago. wish kidding. Nobody tripped themselves.   took around 10 months consistently normal. others lasts days weeks. would get hints smells seconds time that. never lost ability taste, though impacted able smell things. No, talking myth get Covid *from* vaccine itself. never said vaccinated could never get covid happen encounter actual virus. fact, later interview said vaccines still effective preventing severe disease death delta variant, implies infection post-vaccination possible. ""It worth losing sleep over"", would better choice words. US dropped ball this, US clinical trials done. takes time Yes let’s compare people calling misinformation lies slaughtering people  alive dangerous thing do: 100% guarantee going die.... point, anyway. Start Fox, feeding Aunt Dottie info. Don’t attack auntie first.

If Fox NK propaganda outfit, would ethical issue banning misinformation. Fox, OANN, Newsmax et al constrained content distribute increases irresponsible behavior around pandemic.    comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

My countries plays fast loose, I'd prefer stolid, safe playing countries response. particles infant it

These people need institutionalized. Could fooled me. Still feel like we're second wave. Well - case local legal system ""mandatory vaccination"" means get it, otherwise may fined, children, also get vaccinated - otherwise may fined. single fine either - get fined numerous times, total sum yearly average wage. Oh, administrative - can't challenge it, either - giving real financial incentive actually get vaccine.

And that's already case polio, TB measles vaccine here, along several ones. 

The whole ""let's inconvenience people compliance"" thing - said - way get around issue. I'm expecting work long run.

Call pessimist, I've already seen protests festivals concerts admitting vaccinated people, well backtracking. Even make proof vaccination mandatory, still going clubs, bars, restaurants, stores outlets serve vaccinated.
